1. Project Context, Development Objectives, and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
1.      At the time of project appraisal (2004), Kazakhstan was experiencing abundant
proceeds from its exports, mainly petroleum and other mineral resources. In that context,
the mere 5 percent share of agriculture in Kazakhstan’s exports may have seemed
insignificant, but it did not diminish the overall importance of agriculture for the country.
Agriculture employed 30 percent of the labor force and was the primary source of
livelihood, directly or indirectly, for about 6.5 million rural residents of a total population
of 15 million.1 After an initial decline during the early post-Soviet period, the sector grew
during the three consecutive years preceding appraisal. During that period, the sector had
undergone significant transformation from collective farming to the new paradigm of
privatized, mostly medium-sized family farms. That type of farm numbered 122,000 in
2003, 7.5 times greater than in the 1990s.2 On the policy side, the government had passed
new laws such as the Land Code, the Real Estate Registration Law, and the Bankruptcy
Law and had mostly liberalized prices and trade.

2.       Agriculture faced serious challenges, however. The most serious challenge was
that the sector’s investment needs were mounting, especially to replace obsolete
agricultural machinery, but loans and leasing operations covered only 17 percent of
investment needs. Despite the growing demand for rural financial services, the supply of
those services was limited by various factors, including: (i) farmers’ inadequate financial
skills, coupled with insufficient skill in long-term lending in the banking sector, which
regarded agricultural lending as less desirable than other lending opportunities; (ii)
production and market (price) risks that deterred risk-averse parties—in this case, farmers
and bankers—from borrowing/lending transactions; (iii) the lack of suitable collateral;
and (iv) poor financial market integration, which affected the microfinance organizations’
ability to obtain capital for loans to small-scale borrowers.

3.      In this context, the Government of Kazakhstan launched a variety of credit
programs for agriculture to complement the private financial sector’s resources. In 2003
these programs amounted to US$ 72.3 million and were channeled primarily through (i)
regional governments for on-lending to farmers against bank guarantees (US$ 30.6
million); (ii) a state-owned leasing company, KazAgroFinance (U$ 19.9 million); (iii) a
state-owned livestock trading company, Mal Onimderi (US$ 10.2 million); and Agrarian
Credit Corporation (US$ 5.4 million). The balance was used for a line of credit to
commercial banks for financing agro-processing equipment and to reimburse farmers for
some portion of the interest paid on credit obtained under commercial terms. It was
estimated that overall government credit programs accounted for about 8 percent of
agricultural lending by commercial banks and leasing companies. The significant unmet
demand for credit that remained in the sector constrained growth in small-scale
agriculture and rural small and medium enterprises (SMEs).

4.       The government recognized the central role of the private financial sector in
financing rural investment and set out to create an enabling environment for it to do so. It
(i) streamlined the law on leasing, (ii) adopted a grain law to serve as a platform for a
warehouse receipt financing system in the grain market, (iii) set up a commission to
review the existing legislation on commodity exchanges to improve price/market
efficiency, (iv) launched a crop insurance program that, if successful, would make rural
lending more appealing to financial institutions, and (v) passed a microfinance law to
stimulate the emergence and growth of microfinance institutions (MFIs).

5.       The Government of Kazakhstan also sought World Bank assistance in addressing
agricultural and rural finance issues through a second phase of the Agricultural Post-
Privatization Assistance Project (APPAP). The second phase was intended to continue
the satisfactorily completed first phase of that program. The rationale for the Bank’s
further involvement was to build on the success of APPAP’s first phase and to assist
Kazakhstan in promoting access to finance in rural areas. In addition to scaling up the
credit line, which constituted the core of the project and the main means of addressing the
shortage of agricultural and rural financing, the Bank would bring its global experience in
agricultural risk management to bear on refining the government’s crop insurance
program and streamlining its implementation arrangements. Having an adequate crop
insurance program was very important for Kazakhstan, which had the highest yield
variation (27 percent) among the world’s main grain producers,3 with 80 percent of that
variation attributable to weather. The lack of risk management tools was affecting
farmers’ incomes and hampering commercial lending to agriculture because of the
common fear of probable default caused by adverse weather.

6.      On its side, the Bank saw opportunities for improving the efficiency of market
operations through commodity exchanges. It was estimated that improved price
efficiency in the grain market alone could result in an immediate revenue gain of
US$ 60–80 million per year for farmers. The Bank was also to contribute its international
experience in long-term investment lending, structured financing (to bypass issues related
to lack of collateral), and promoting and building capacity for microfinance operations.

7.      In terms of higher-level objectives, the project was to support the government’s
goal of economic diversification beyond the extractive sector (mainly petroleum),
creating economic opportunities and improving living conditions by promoting broad-
based, private sector-led growth in rural areas, where 45 percent of the country’s
population lives.

Agreement, although the essence was the same. Because it provides more detailed
information, however, the wording from the PAD is used as the formal PDO. APPAP-2
sought to build on achievements under APPAP-1 by: (i) building capacity for viable rural
businesses through strengthening and expanding the rural advisory services program; (ii)
supporting agricultural risk management initiatives; (iii) facilitating the development and
implementation of new financial instruments by commercial banks and leasing
companies for deepening rural financial outreach; and (iv) supporting sustainable rural
microfinance schemes for providing financial services to rural micro-entrepreneurs that
are currently excluded from the formal banking sector.

9.       The key performance indicator of the project’s outcome was:
             ―  Growth in Rural SME portfolio of PFIs‖4 (participating financial
               institutions).

10.      Results indicators for each component were:
            Component 1:
             Number of farmers using the private consultants.
            Component 2:
             Number of crop insurance contracts issued.
             Number of contracts traded on the exchange.
            Component 3:
             Number of loans disbursed from credit facility.
            Component 4:
             Number of MFIs qualifying for borrowing from commercial sources.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

11.     The PDO remained the same,5 but some indicators and their target values were
revised twice as part of project restructurings approved on November 9, 2010 and
November 18, 2011 as a ―   corrective measure‖ to align the indicators with changes in the
project. Some indicators were dropped or replaced with new indicators to reflect the
changes in project activities; for other indicators, target values were revised to account
for cancellation of loan amounts that were not utilized due to slow implementation of
some activities.6 The PDO indicators were formulated differently in different documents
or even in different parts of the same document (for example, in the PAD, the Loan
Agreement’s Supplemental Letter 2, and ISRs). The PAD contained different wording
and different measures of the PDO on different pages. The main text on page 6 has the


4
  Taken from page 34 of the PAD. The wording of the outcome indicator was formulated differently in
different places, as described in Section 1.3.
5
  The Bank team was considering changing the PDO to adjust it to the amended scope of activities, but in
view of the procedural hurdles, including a potentially lengthy parliamentary ratification, the team refrained
from changing the PDO.
6
  See Annex 2, Attachment 1 for a revised list of indicators as per Supplemental Letter 2.


                                                      3
following as the outcome indicators: (i) Access to financial services improved:
supplemental growth (in real terms) in overall rural and agricultural lending by
commercial banks and leasing companies of at least 10 percent per year during the
project period; (ii) Microfinance institutions outreach improved: the aggregate lending
by microfinance institutions is up by 15 percent. These indicators implied that growth in
lending was to be measured for the entire banking and microfinance sectors. But page 34
of the PAD had only one PDO indicator: ―      Growth in Rural SME portfolio of PFIs,‖
which refers to growth only in the participating financial institutions. The Supplemental
Letter 2 to the Loan Agreement dated April 1, 2005 contained indicators formulated to
capture both the sector-wide lending growth and growth in PFIs only.

12.     In project Restructuring Papers of November 9, 2010 and November 18, 2011, the
PDO indicator was formulated as ―       Growth in rural lending due to the project,‖ with a
cumulative target of 10 percent. Given the ambiguities of the initial versions of the
outcome indicator and the relatively small size of the project compared to the entire
financial sector, it is believed that the last version of the PDO indicator better reflects and
measures the project’s outcome through growth in the rural portfolio of PFIs. This
indicator will be used to assess the achievement of the PDO in Section 3.2. It should be
noted, however, that this indicator was omitted in the amendments to the Supplemental
Letter 2 that were signed after the project restructurings mentioned above, and it was not
monitored by the project. Meanwhile, the Implementation Status and Results (ISR)
Report contained this indicator but expressed the target in absolute amounts (US$ 16.0
million), whereas the PAD and the two Restructuring Papers referred to the percentage of
growth. These discrepancies remained until the project closed.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

13.     The ultimate beneficiaries of the project were small-scale farmers and rural SMEs.
They were to benefit from financial advisory services, training programs, and the ability
to cover or mitigate their risk through insurance and commodity exchange transactions.
All of these efforts were expected to improve beneficiaries’ access to financing.
Financing would be provided by commercial banks and MFIs, which would receive
training in new financial instruments and long-term lending to increase their lending
capacities. The government would benefit from technical assistance to improve the crop
insurance program and establish commodity exchanges. Other beneficiaries included the
Hydrometeorology Agency, whose 40 weather stations were to be fully automated
through the provision of hardware and software. If the project had been implemented as
originally intended, the insurance companies and commodity exchange participants
would also have benefited, but the curtailment or cancellation of related activities
prevented those benefits from materializing.

1.5 Original Components

14.   Component 1: Rural Financial Advisory Services (US$ 1.681 million, all
government financed) to build awareness among farmers about business planning and




                                              4
financing options through the establishment and engagement of a private financial
consultants’ network.

15.   Component 2: Agricultural Risk Management (US$ 1.924 million, all
government financed) consisting of two sub-components:
     Production Risk Management (US$ 1.424 million) to improve the crop insurance
      program through technical assistance, upgrading of weather data infrastructure,
      and training of agro-meteorologists, farmers, insurance companies, and other
      actors.
     Price Risk Management/Market Efficiency (US$ 0.5 million) to: (i) advise the
      government on technical, financial, organizational, and regulatory aspects of a
      modern commodity exchange and (ii) train potential investors, commodity
      exchange managers, regulators, key companies, and agents and build mass
      awareness using various channels.

16.    Component 3: Rural Outreach by the Mainstream Financial Sector
(US$ 85.304 million) to help commercial banks and leasing companies accelerate rural
investment lending through loans and by expanding the use of nontraditional instruments
such as leasing of agricultural machinery and structured finance. The component had two
sub-components:
     Technical Assistance (US$ 0.604 million, all government financed).
     Credit Line Facility (US$ 84.7 million, of which US$30.0 million government,
       US$ 30.0 million IBRD, US$ 10.8 million PFIs, US$ 13.9 million beneficiaries).

17.   Component 4: Rural Micro Finance Development (US$5.372 million) had two
sub-components:
     Technical Assistance (US$ 0.622 million, all government financed) to support
      selected MFIs to strengthen their financial management, accounting, risk
      management, credit analysis, governance, and reporting capacities; assist the
      development of new rural microfinance products; facilitate linkage of MFIs to
      commercial sources of funding; and conduct a baseline study of the MFI sector.
     Micro Credit Facility (US$ 4.750 million, of which US$ 1.1 million government,
      US$ 3.65 million IBRD) for eligible MFIs for further on-lending to the latter’s
      clients.

18.     Component 5: Project Management (US$ 0.46 million, all government
financed). The project was to be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture with
assistance from a team of consultants (TOC) hired under this component for day-to-day
implementation. The component financed office equipment and incremental operating
expenses incurred in the course of implementing and monitoring the project.

1.6 Revised Components

19.   The Price Risk Management sub-component of the Agricultural Risk
Management component was cancelled in November 2011 at the request of the
government because of its decision to remove price risk management issues from the


                                          5
Ministry of Agriculture’s responsibilities. This cancellation was approved by the Bank,7
but the amendment to the Loan Agreement was not countersigned by the Borrower on the
grounds that the signed amendment had to be ratified by the Parliament, which would not
have happened until long after the project closed on December 31, 2011. Therefore, even
though the sub-component was cancelled by mutual agreement, it was not fully
formalized.

1.7 Other significant changes

20.     To accelerate the disbursement of credit line funds, a 3rd order restructuring8 was
done on December 16, 2008 to (i) introduce an advance disbursement mechanism for
PFIs, (ii) allow working capital financing under the credit line, and (iii) increase the
individual sub-loan size from US$ 100,000 to US$ 1,000,000.

21.     The project was restructured for the second time on November 9, 2010 9 to
partially cancel US$ 19,590,725 and revise the performance indicators, because it was
expected that low disbursements would prevent loan funds from being used in full. The
partial cancellation affected Component 3 (US$ 15,000,000 cancelled), Component 4
(US$ 3,240,725), and Unallocated Category (US$ 1,350,000).

22.    The project was restructured for the third time on November 18, 201110 to: (i)
cancel the undisbursed balance of US$ 8,474,500 from Component 3, as no more
disbursements were expected to be made by the closing date; (ii) cancel the Price Risk
Management sub-component of Component 2 (see Section 1.6), and (iii) revise the
performance indicators to reflect the above cancellations.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

23.      Over the project’s life, many factors affected its implementation and outcomes.
These included an optimistic project design, delays with effectiveness, adoption of a new
Budget Code, changes in the economic situation, rigidity of internal government rules,
staff turnover, and inadequate working conditions for the TOC.

2.1 Project Preparation, Design, and Quality at Entry

24.    The project’s preparation and design were affected by the following factors. As
mentioned, it was prepared in 2004 as a follow-up phase for APPAP-1, which
demonstrated potential for lending to small-scale farmers and rural entrepreneurs.
Inspired by the success of the first phase, the second phase (APPAP-2) sought to expand

    A 2nd order restructuring approved by the Bank on November 18, 2011. The agreement on this
restructuring was reached in the autumn of 2010, but it took the government almost a year to send the
request for the restructuring.


                                                 6
the outreach of rural financial advisory services and commercial lending. In addition, two
new components on agricultural risk management and rural microfinance development
were introduced. Even though they made the project more complex than APPAP-1, the
additional activities were complementary and enhanced the chances of achieving the
project objectives, if implemented successfully. The design of the project was based on
the country background analysis, including the social and economic importance of the
agricultural sector, its financing needs, and the factors affecting whether those needs were
met. A good assessment of agricultural production and price risks as well as poor
integration of financial markets was done.

25.     Given the logical linkages among the components, which together would
contribute to better access to financing by farmers and rural SMEs, the project’s design
looked appealing. The government had shown its commitment to the project during the
preparation stage, although support was not unanimous; some government officials were
of the opinion that the credit line was unnecessary.

26.      The inclusion of new components on risk management and microfinance turned
out to be a bit too optimistic. Even though the team should be praised for taking the
initiative and risk to innovate, subsequent circumstances proved that the project could not
be implemented as designed.

27.     At negotiations, the Ministry of Finance cut the project budget, which had
repercussions for the implementation of Component 2; the resulting budget made it
impossible to find qualified consultancy companies for the assignments. Eventually, the
scope of this component was curtailed significantly. The budget cut also led to inadequate
staffing, frequent changes in the TOC, poor working conditions, and other issues that
took a long time to resolve.

28.     Overall, the project’s quality at entry was rated by the Quality Assurance Group
as Satisfactory during its Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio review in 2010.11

2.2 Implementation

29.     The following factors of a structural nature affected project implementation.

30.    Strong economic growth during 2004–07 at a rate of 9–10 percent per annum12
caused commercial banks to focus on lending large amounts to big borrowers, mainly in
industry, trade, and construction. Banks had little or no interest in small-scale agricultural
and rural lending. The project’s credit lines could not entice them, as they had enough
loan resources, including those obtained from international financial markets. The
expected participation of all seven banks involved in APPAP-1 did not materialize for the
same reasons. Interviews with the three interested banks showed that the maximum sub-

                                                   7
loan size of US$ 100,000, aimed at small and medium borrowers, was simply too small
for the banks to consider and that the ceiling must be increased. In addition, the fast pace
of the country’s economic development had driven up prices of goods, and some
potential borrowers regarded US$ 100,000 as inadequate. Given these realities, the
maximum sub-loan size was increased to US$ 1,000,000 to accommodate some larger
sub-loans and retain the banks’ interest in the credit line. At the same time, it was hoped
that smaller-scale farmers and rural entrepreneurs would remain the main target for
financial services.

31.     The unexpected global financial crisis of 2008 also negatively affected the
project’s credit line, but for different reasons. Kazakhstan was one of the countries in
Europe and Central Asia to be most affected by the crisis. Local banks became very risk
averse in lending, as their provisions for nonperforming loans kept mounting. The share
of nonperforming loans in Kazakhstan’s commercial banks soared from 7.53 percent at
the end of 2008 to 36.15 percent at the end of 2009. Under these conditions, lending to
small- and medium-scale agricultural producers and processors became even less of a
priority for the banks, and the project’s credit line was untouched until mid-2009.
Although three banks (in addition to Eurasian Bank and Bank CenterCredit) wanted to
participate in the project and applied for the credit line during this period, they were all
disqualified because of the losses they had incurred in the previous financial year as well
as the high share of nonperforming loans in their portfolios.13

32.    In summary, the economic boom of 2004–07 and financial crisis of 2008
ultimately affected APPAP-2 more than any other project in the country’s portfolio. For
one thing, the core of the project was the credit line; for another, the primary vehicle for
implementing the main credit line—the banking sector—was hit hard by the economic
downturn.

33.     The rigidity of the government’s internal rules made the implementation of the
project overly complex and slow. For example, the project had to have a feasibility study,
a government-approved equivalent of the PAD. Any changes to the project or
implementation arrangements, including minor amendments, had to be reflected in the
feasibility study document and approved by the government. Since the project required
several changes, getting them approved by the government took time and delayed
implementation of the amendments. Lines of responsibility were not clearly drawn
among the ministries involved in the project, which contributed to the slowdown.
Although the Loan Agreement clearly stated that the Ministry of Agriculture was
responsible for implementing the project, the Bank’s Aide Mémoires noted that continued
micromanagement by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy caused
inordinate delays.

34.      The following project-specific factors also affected implementation.



13
  Under the project’s eligibility criteria, a PFI had to show positive income over the last three-year period,
and it had to have assets of acceptable quality.


                                                      8
35.     Delayed effectiveness of the Loan Agreement. The project was approved on
December 13, 2004. The Loan Agreement was signed soon thereafter on April 1, 2005,
but because of the protracted ratification process, the loan became effective only on
February 28, 2006, more than a year after Board approval. The momentum gained at the
end of the project’s first phase was lost.

36.      New rules of the game set by the new Budget Code. The new Budget Code, which
came into effect on January 1, 2005, had a strong negative effect on implementation of
the credit line component. All credit resources channeled to the PFIs through the national
budget, including World Bank loan funds, had to be approved by a Government
Resolution—an overly complex, inflexible, and time-consuming process. Three other
aspects of the new code were similarly discouraging:
    (i) Implementation of the budget credit lines through a single operator. This rule
             created a bottleneck for disbursing project funds and seriously undermined the
             implementation of the project’s credit line component.
    (ii) Stipulation of specific loan amounts in Subsidiary Loan Agreements prevented the
             different pace of disbursement of different PFIs at different times from being
             accommodated. The administrative challenges likely to be involved in
             amending and re-signing the Subsidiary Loan Agreement were additional
             deterrents for potential PFIs.
    (iii)The requirement for PFIs to put up collateral in addition to a portfolio assignment
             clause under the Subsidiary Loan Agreement was another disincentive for
             PFIs. The potential PFIs revealed that they would not be able to provide
             physical collateral because of negative pledge clauses under agreements with
             their other creditors. The option of giving the Ministry of Finance access to
             the banks’ correspondent accounts with the National Bank was not acceptable
             to most prospective PFIs.

37.     The World Bank team brought these issues to the government’s attention, and
after a lengthy process the respective amendments were introduced. After the PFIs were
selected and the approval process was adjusted, the first Subsidiary Loan Agreement for
US$ 200,000 was signed in October 2007, after about 20 months of processing by the
government. The credit line then stalled until June 30, 2009, when the Subsidiary Loan
Agreement was signed with Eurasia Bank, followed by the Subsidiary Loan Agreement
with Center Credit Bank (April 30, 2010). Late activation of the credit line and limited
participation of PFIs (exacerbated by the economic factors discussed earlier) slowed
disbursements and led to partial cancellation of loan amounts.

38.    The Budget Code also affected implementation of the credit line under
Component 4. Under the project, the credit line for the MFIs was to be accessed through
a Subsidiary Loan Agreement signed between the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of
Agriculture, and the MFI. As indicated, the new Budget Code required that the credit line
be implemented via ―  an operator,‖ meaning some financial institution. The new lending
mechanism under this component was approved by Government Resolution N969 only in
October 2007. The new rule required that the operator be selected through a competitive
process, but none of the commercial banks were interested. After a second attempt, the



                                             9
state-owned Agrarian Credit Corporation (ACC) was selected. The Subsidiary Loan
Agreement between the Ministry of Agriculture and ACC was signed on December 11,
2009, just a few weeks before the original closing date of December 31, 2009.14 Even
then, the credit line was not used. Only three MFIs applied for the microcredit facility,
but none fully met the eligibility criteria. Strong MFIs that would have been eligible
preferred to borrow from investors abroad at cheaper rates. As a result, the entire
undisbursed amount of US$ 3,240,724 15 from the Bank loan was cancelled under the
restructuring approved on November 9, 2010.

39.      At the operational level, issues with the staffing and operating budget for the local
      16
TOC negatively affected implementation. The salary scales denominated in US dollars
were low in relation to market rates and deteriorated with the appreciation of the tenge.
As might be expected, attracting good consultants at noncompetitive rates proved
impossible, and hiring took some time. The capacity of the TOC was low at the
beginning, and turnover was frequent. 17 Even relatively simple procedures like the
translation of bidding documents held up procurement by many months. These
difficulties originated with the arbitrary 50 percent reduction in operating costs and TOC
headcount by the Ministry of Finance. With no translator and no budget to outsource
translations, procurement essentially ceased (without the translated documents, the
Ministry of Agriculture could not move ahead with procurement). It took more than a
year to change the staffing schedule and hire a translator.

40.     Inadequate working conditions for the TOC weakened its effectiveness. Initially
the team was located in the basement of the Ministry of Agriculture’s old building,
although the space could accommodate only three of the five consultants and was prone
to flooding. On one occasion, flooding damaged documents, which were kept on the floor
because there were no filing cabinets. The TOC had outdated computers, no fax, and no
internet connection. To communicate with the Bank, the team members had to find and
use free computers connected to the internet, an inefficient use of time and a practice that
placed the confidentiality of project correspondence at risk. More than a year after
implementation began, the TOC was provided another office. That office, located outside
the Ministry of Agriculture building, limited team members’ access to ministry offices
and information systems. Daily interaction and communication with the ministry on
project matters was very difficult.

41.    The factors mentioned above explain why APPAP-1 was successful and APPAP-
2 was not. First, economic conditions were different during the implementation of
APPAP-1. The economy was not booming as it was at the start of APPAP-2, and the
banks were still interested in credit lines. Second, the design of APPAP-1 was simpler; it



14
   The closing date was extended to December 31, 2011 on September 25, 2009.
15
   At the time of restructuring, US$ 409,275 of the total amount allocated to Component 4
(USD$ 3,650,000) was advanced to the Special Account and had to be cancelled at closing of the loan.
16
   A team of consultants (TOC) was hired to support the Ministry of Agriculture in implementing the
project.
17
   The consultants’ salaries improved only in 2009, when the tenge depreciated by about 25 percent.


                                                   10
did not contain additional activities, agricultural risk management, and microfinance.
Third, APPAP-1 had a dedicated Project Implementation Unit.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation, and Utilization

42.     The project was not designed with a detailed M&E system. The PAD and Project
Implementation Manual briefly described how monitoring data would be collected. The
Ministry of Agriculture, assisted by the TOC, would collect information on direct
beneficiaries from individual PFIs and MFIs. Data on overall growth in rural lending by
commercial banks was to be taken from the National Bank, and the Association of
Microfinance Organizations of Kazakhstan (AMFOK) was to provide data on MFIs. Each
member of the TOC was responsible for collecting and analyzing data related to
particular project components.

43.     This arrangement involved a number of parties and required effective
coordination and consolidation. There is no evidence that coordination and consolidation
were done satisfactorily. Monitoring data were not reported or recorded systematically.
Very few field trips were organized to monitor project activities. Instead, data were
collected on a relatively ad hoc basis, at times only at the behest of the Bank team.
Despite repeated requests and reminders in the Aide Mémoires, the first project progress
report was not submitted until October 2007 for the 2008 Mid-term Review.

44.     Several factors contributed to poor monitoring of project results. First, overall
coordination was lacking; second, there was no demand for this information for decision
making; third, staff turnover affected the continuity of the process; and finally, the TOC’s
travel budget was insufficient to monitor the activities in the field.

45.    The Quality Assurance Group’s Quality Assessment of Lending Portfolio review
(2010) assessed the quality of proposed M&E arrangements as Satisfactory but reported
poor implementation. The most important issue was that the PDO indicator was not
monitored and measured.

46.     The project impact assessment was to be done by an experienced international
consultant, but budget constraints meant that the assignment was carried out by a local
consultancy company. The resulting study offers some insight into project results, but the
soundness of its assessment methodology, soundness of the evidence collected, and
interpretation of results are questionable.

47.    Parts of the monitoring system used for the project continue to operate
independently. For example, the National Bank collects and publishes credit market data.
The data are available in the bank’s statistical bulletins and on its website. AMFOK
continues to collect information from member MFIs.




                                            11
2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

48.      The Environmental Category of the project was FI (Financial Intermediation). An
Environmental Review was completed in March 2004 for project preparation.
Environmental Guidelines for Lending were developed for the credit line and were an
integral part of the Rural Investment Guidelines. Responsibility for checking compliance
of sub-projects with environmental norms rested with the PFIs. The TOC was responsible
for monitoring compliance with the Guidelines. The limited budget—with no allowance
for air travel—prevented the team members responsible for this task from monitoring all
of the sub-projects. No issues were reported in relation to the projects that were visited,
however.

49.    The World Bank environmental specialist participated in one supervision mission,
and no issues were identified. The limited safeguards supervision was explained by the
small number of sub-loans under the credit line where safeguard issues might potentially
be found.

50.     From a financial management perspective, the major issues were the lack of an
acceptable accounting system for an extended period and late submission of financial
management reports and audit reports. The first financial management report was
submitted only at the end of September 2008, despite repeated reminders in the Aide
Mémoires. For more than two years, the Financial Services Department of the Ministry of
Agriculture was unable to install and launch accounting system software 1C. Eventually,
the attempt was abandoned, and project accounting was done manually through an Excel-
based system. With subsequent improvements in reporting, and after the Excel-based
accounting system was brought to an acceptable level, the financial management rating
was upgraded to Moderately Satisfactory.

51.     Handling of procurement was rated Moderately Satisfactory, reflecting the lack of
procurement capacity in the TOC and Ministry of Agriculture and, at the same time, the
absence of major procurement violations. Relatively few procurement contracts were
administered under the project. Procurement under the sub-loans followed commercial
practices. The procurement specialist based in the Bank’s country office was available for
support and advice to the TOC.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

52.     Following completion, the PFI will continue to administer the sub-loans financed
under the project until funds received under the Subsidiary Loan Agreement are repaid to
the Ministry of Finance. Hydromet will operate and maintain the automated weather
stations.

53.    The government continues to support the financing of agriculture and rural
development through various programs, such as the Damu Foundation, Business Road

Map 2020, KazAgroFinance, and the Agrarian Credit Corporation. The President of
Kazakhstan has declared that employment creation through the promotion of rural
entrepreneurship and training is the number one priority. Development of agriculture and
finding alternative ways of enhancing farmers’ access to financing is among the top 10
tasks. 18 The government has been instructed to develop programs on livestock sector
development, including the utilization of distant pastures.

54.     Based on the implementation experience and the disappointing results of APPAP-
2, the Bank and government decided not to trigger a third phase.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design, and Implementation

55.     The objective of the project, which was to enhance the access to commercial
financial services by farmers and small/medium-size rural enterprises, was and is very
relevant to the country’s needs and priorities. Strategically, at the preparation stage the
project was meant to contribute to the government’s objective of diversifying the
economy and improving living conditions of the population by promoting broad-based,
private sector-led growth in rural areas, where the incidence of poverty is twice as high as
in urban areas. At the project’s completion, its objective remains aligned with the
government’s current priorities and the World Bank’s strategy. The government’s
Strategic Plan for Development 2020 covers a set of priorities intended to achieve a
competitive, diversified economy, including development of the agro-industrial sector
and creation of jobs. As noted, the President of Kazakhstan’s list of the top 10 tasks for
government at the start of 2012 included the development of agriculture and finding
alternative ways of enhancing farmers’ access to financing. The World Bank’s new
Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY12–FY17 states that ―        with land reform and
privatization, agriculture has excellent prospects, but the state dominates the provision of
services and finance for agriculture. Important reforms include strengthening of farmer
organizations, agricultural SME development, and rural credit and agricultural
insurance.‖ In this respect, ― the proposed CPS would also continue to provide advisory
and investment assistance to help generate productive transformation and increased rural
incomes in the agricultural sector.‖

56.     The design of the project was well conceived in terms of logical connections
among its components and their expected contribution to achievement of the project’s
objective. Each component was designed to address specific problems that remain
relevant. The diagram shows the logical connections and expected cause-effect
relationships among the project’s various activities and outputs.

57.    Aspects of the design were not suited to the realities of implementation, however.
For example, the credit line sub-component was predicated on the expectation that banks
would continue to issue small loans as they did under APPAP-1, but the economic boom
reduced commercial banks’ interest in small loans. No feasible alternative lending
mechanism could be developed to reach smaller borrowers in rural areas,19 aside from the
microfinance component targeted to smaller borrowers, which also failed to work as
planned (see Section 2.2). In summary, despite shortfalls in design and implementation,
the overall relevance of the project is considered to be high.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

58.    The PDO was not achieved, although some progress was made toward its
achievement. As explained in Section 1.3, the achievement of the PDO is assessed
                              Growth in rural lending due to the project.‖
through the outcome indicator ―

59.    Although the unit of measurement for the outcome indicator in the PAD was a
percentage of growth, the ISR (#6) of May 30, 2008 set the outcome indicator’s end


19
   The definition of ―rural areas‖ adopted under the project covered all populated areas except for Almaty
and Astana. Other urban areas were included under the project at preparation on the grounds that business
activities were as poorly developed in those areas as in rural areas. Also, banks were rarely present in truly
rural areas. Banks were located in oblast and rayon centers; from those locations, they served parts of the
surrounding rural area.

target in absolute terms at US$ 66.6 million. This figure was revised downwards to
US$ 37.5 million in ISR (#12) of December 27, 2010 and reduced further to US$ 16.0
million in ISR (#14) of December 25, 2011. The actual lending by the project’s closing
date of December 31, 2011 was US$ 12.96 million, including funds from the IBRD credit
line and government co-financing. These resources were provided through 8320 sub-loans
(against the original target of 750 and revised target of 100 sub-loans). Thus the original
and revised targets were significantly underachieved.

60.    With the PFIs’ contribution, the original target for total lending under the project
was US$ 70.8 million. 21 The actual amount at the end of the project was US$ 17.5
million, or only 24.7 percent of the amount initially planned.

61.     In terms of lending growth in PFIs, Eurasian Bank (which accounted for about 93
percent of the actual lending under the project) had a credit portfolio of KZT 150,015
million as of June 1, 2009, just prior to joining the project. The share of agricultural loans
in that portfolio was 5.7 percent (KZT 8,686 million). As of November 1, 2012, Eurasian
Bank’s total portfolio was KZT 183,229 million, while the share of agricultural loans
amounted to 12.5 percent (KZT 22,883 million).22 In absolute terms, over 2.5 years of
participation in the project, agricultural lending grew by a factor of 2.6, and its share in
the lending portfolio increased by a factor of 2.2. These rates of growth look excellent,
but overall lending under the project was only one-quarter of the amount initially planned,
so the outcome target and the project development objective were not achieved.

62.  In terms of outputs under specific components, the project’s achievements are
summarized below. For a detailed presentation of outputs by component, see Annex 2.

63.     Under Component1: Rural Financial Advisory Services, the project trained 603
individual consultants against a target of 600. These consultants were to provide financial
advisory services to 17,000 people as a way of expanding the pool of qualified borrowers.
About 11,800 farmers sought consultancy services from the consultants trained by the
project, but they represented 65% percent of the 18,246 attendees of information sessions,
which is a good achievement. Almost 5,000 business plans were prepared for these
clients; unfortunately, none of the plans were financed from the project credit line
because of its delayed implementation and banks’ reluctance to lend to small borrowers,
who often lacked adequate collateral. Hence the output target for the number of trained
consultants was fully met and the target on the number of clients was partially met.




20
   Of these, 38 (46 percent) were agricultural sub-loans.

   US$ 30.0 million (IBRD) plus US$ 30.0 million (Government of Kazakhstan) plus US$ 10.8 million
(PFIs).

64.     Under Component 2: Agricultural Risk Management, the two initial output
targets were: (i) number of crop insurance contracts issued (14,500) and (ii) number of
contracts traded in commodity exchanges (33,000). These targets were not achieved
because the component could not be implemented as planned (the inadequate budget
meant that the required consultancy inputs were not obtained). In early 2010, the Bank
team and Ministry of Agriculture agreed to drop the commodity exchange activities from
the project for reasons explained in Section 1.6, but it took more than a year to get an
official request for this action from the Borrower. The scope of activities on crop
insurance also was reduced significantly following repeated problems with hiring
consultants. The target outputs were changed to: (i) number of oblasts where the
insurance schemes are analyzed and recommendations made (8) and (ii) number of
rayons where the agricultural weather stations are equipped and upgraded (6). The latter
two targets were met.

65.     Under Component 3: Rural Outreach by the Mainstream Financial Sector,
the original target was to extend 750 sub-loans. As explained, the actual number of sub-
loans was 83, owing to problems with implementation of the credit line and partial
cancellation of the Loan. That number is less than the final revised target of 100 sub-
loans and is only 11 percent of the original target. It should be noted that the entire sub-
loan portfolio was disbursed during the last two years of the project. By the last year of
the project, the PFI had attained good momentum and was seeing considerable interest
and demand from borrowers. Had the project been extended one more time, it is possible
that the entire credit line allocation would have been disbursed. Given the project’s
earlier performance, an extension was not considered an option by the task team or Bank
management.

66.    In terms of capacity building under this component, 568 credit specialists and 240
branch managers from more than 40 financial institutions were trained in investment
lending and structured finance. The participants reported very high levels of satisfaction
with the relevance, quality, and usefulness of the training. On a 10-point scale, the overall
score given by the participants in the course evaluation was 9.4. Feedback was

67.    Under Component 4: Rural Micro Finance Development, significant work was
done to build capacity in MFIs. Overall, 310 people from 146 MFIs were trained on
various topics (strategic business planning, risk management, credit cycle, new product
development, linkage to commercial sources of funding, and others). Four participating
MFIs built up sufficient institutional capacity to qualify for borrowing from commercial
banks. But again, none of the four MFIs benefited from the project’s credit line for
various reasons: the delayed start of the credit line and its subsequent cancellation, the
banks’ unwillingness to lend, and/or the MFIs’ dislike of the banks’ lending terms.
Instead, some of the stronger MFIs trained under the project were able to locate investors
and lenders elsewhere who offered more favorable terms.

68.     Thus despite some positive intermediate outcomes and outputs for this component,
for reasons mentioned earlier, they were not able to contribute directly to growth in rural
lending under the project.




                                                                    17
3.3 Efficiency

69.     The financial analysis of a sample of sub-loans issued under the project has
shown that: (i) overall, gross and net returns of the enterprises increased reasonably after
implementing the activities financed by the loans; (ii) benefit/cost ratios demonstrate the
attractiveness of the investments; (iii) the level of profitability varies significantly
between the activities. Positive net present value (NPV) for the analyzed farms and
enterprises ranges from KZT 283,000 to KZT 460 million. The internal rate of return
(IRR) ranges from 13 percent to 975 percent. These numbers are much higher than those
projected during appraisal: NPVs between KZT 84,000 and KZT 41 million and IRRs
between 13 percent and 50 percent. Favorable cash flows from the most analyzed
investments give an indication that the project credit line would continue revolving
effectively even after the project’s closure.

70.    A sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess the impact on financial returns of
changes in: (i) output prices, (ii) expected outputs, (iii) operating costs, (iv) interest rate,
and (v) investment costs. The analysis showed that the credits are more sensitive to
changes in both outputs and price assumptions than they are to variations in investment,
operating costs, and interest rate. However, they remain reasonably sound in revenue
terms.

71.     With an average net incremental income at US$ 0.66 for each dollar borrowed,
the total NPV of the credit line of US$ 12.96 million could be estimated at about
US$ 16.5 million—significantly lower than the US$ 50.1 million estimated at appraisal.
The shortfall is explained by significant underutilization of the credit line.

72.     In terms of efficiency, the implemented activities such as consultancy services,
training, procurement of goods, and so on were efficient in the sense that they were
carried out through competitive selection following the World Bank’s procurement rules.
As such, they were implemented at the best rates available in that time and under those
circumstances. Even though they were efficient, they were not truly effective, however,
in the sense that they did not lead to increased access to finance by farmers and rural
people. Because of the foregone opportunities in rural business development,
employment, and economic growth, some project resources can be considered as not
having maximized their returns.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating: Unsatisfactory

73.      The objective of the project was very relevant to the needs of the country. It was
consistent with the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy, Kazakhstan’s development
priorities, and the recently adopted Strategic Plan for Development 2020. Shortcomings
in the project’s design and major problems with its implementation prevented it from
achieving its development objective, although some progress was made toward its
achievement. In terms of efficiency, the available resources were underutilized and



                                              18
significant economic and financial gains were foregone. Notable achievements were
made in capacity building and development of financial institutions, and it is expected
that those capacities will be continued to be used in the financial sector. But the impact of
those achievements on the project development objective could not be assessed and
directly attributed to the project, while only a small portion of the original credit line was
utilized and many of the original output targets were not achieved. Therefore, due to
major shortcomings in the achievement of the objective, the project’s outcome is rated
Unsatisfactory.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes, and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

74.      According to Eurasian Bank data, during the implementation of the credit line
some 2,068 new jobs were created, which is believed to contribute to employment
generation and increased incomes in rural areas. The multiplier effect of business
activities supported by the project can be expected to magnify the impact of the project to
some extent.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

75.     The project can be credited with contributing to institutional changes in the
microfinance sector. It helped to strengthen AMFOK, exposed MFIs to international best
practices, and introduced the principles of corporate governance and transparency in
financial accounting and reporting. Many MFIs now publish their financial reports in
MixMarket, and some MFIs have received ratings from international microfinance rating
agencies such as MicroFinanza. The Chairman of the Board of AMFOK was elected in
November 2011 as Chair of the International Coordination Council of the
Commonwealth of Independent States Microfinance Association. 23

76.     The microcredit sector has shown explosive growth over the past seven years. The
number of registered and active microcredit organizations grew from 159 in 2005 to
1,173 in 2011.24 In 2011 alone, 378,000 microcredits were issued for the total amount of
KZT 55.4 billion, helping tens thousands of people to open new micro businesses or to
save existing workplaces. The forecast for 2012 is that 400,000 microcredits valued at
KZT 70 billion will be issued.25 Even though no microloans were issued under the project,
many representatives of microcredit organizations and AMFOK who were interviewed
mentioned that the training provided by the project was very timely and useful. They felt
that without the project’s coordinated technical assistance, the development of AMFOK
and other organizations would have been delayed. The knowledge obtained efficiently
under the project saved them from many aimless efforts to seek the knowledge they
needed.

77.     The commercial banking sector benefited from training in investment lending and
exposure to new lending instruments such as structured finance. A total of 808 branch
managers and credit specialists from more than 40 financial institutions were trained.
Even though the majority of the trainees did not participate in the project’s credit line,
they reportedly apply the acquired knowledge in their own lending businesses. The new
knowledge could not be fully internalized or adopted, however, because of banking
regulations and/or the commercial banks’ own strategies and policies. (For example,
structured loans that allow financing without collateral could not be adopted while
banking regulations require loan security or full provision.)

78.      Similarly, the project intended to expand institutional capacity for agricultural risk
management through crop insurance and commodity exchange operations. The
inadequate budget for these activities caused the commodity exchange activities to be
dropped from the project, while the crop insurance activities were curtailed to a review of
the existing insurance scheme and recommendations for its improvement. The expected
institutional changes in agricultural risk management unfortunately did not materialize,
although the Agricultural Risk Management component was maintained until the last
year of the project.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

79.    The project revealed imperfections in the Budget Code adopted in 2005 and led to
improvements in budget legislation with respect to using financial institutions in budget
programs. For instance, now more than one financial intermediary can participate in the
implementation of government credit line programs for increased outreach.

80.     The Almaty Bank Training Center (ABTC) built its capacity and reputation
through the training it provided to bank personnel under the project. ABTC reportedly
continues to enjoy good demand for its training on various topics, including those that
were first offered under the project.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome: Significant

81.     Even though the government at the highest levels reiterates the importance of
improving access to financial services by rural people and allocates significant amounts
through numerous government-supported credit programs, the risk of not reaching small
rural borrowers remains high. First of all, most state programs are geared toward large-
scale, high-end agricultural producers and processors that fit into the government’s
modernization agenda. Second, the channels for delivering credit funds to small
borrowers remain an issue. Commercial banks still prefer to deal mostly with larger
borrowers in urban areas. Third, provision of acceptable collateral continues to be a
problem for small rural borrowers. On the positive side, the microfinance sector is getting
greater attention from the state. The National Bank of Kazakhstan has presented the draft
Law on Microfinance Organizations to Parliament; the law aims to place MFIs under the
regulatory supervision of the central bank. Combined with mandatory minimum capital



                                              20
requirements and prudential norms, this measure is expected to strengthen and streamline
the microfinance sector, which has been growing very fast but without proper supervision.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry: Moderately Unsatisfactory

82.     The project was prepared based on the successful experience of APPAP-1. The
development objective was strategically relevant and the cause-effect linkages among the
components were well thought out. The new components on agricultural risk
management and microfinance fit very well with the objective of the project and could
serve as complimentary and supportive additions. The Bank team brought its knowledge
of international practice to bear on project preparation and appraisal to solve the local
problem. The Quality Assurance Group assessed quality at entry as Satisfactory, although
it identified as shortcomings the decision not to have a separate Project Implementation
Unit and failure to identify the project management risk.

83.     In retrospect, it appears that some aspects of the project, despite being well
designed in theory, did not fit into the realities of the environment and situation. For
example, the appraisal was too optimistic about the prospects of the agricultural
insurance market and commodity exchanges; commercial banks’ interest in the project
and the government’s commitment were overestimated. During the negotiations, the
government delegation decided to cut the budget of the Agricultural Risk Management
component by a significant amount, which proved detrimental for the component. While
agreeing to the lower allocation, the Bank team did not take appropriate action to adjust
the design of the component to accommodate the more limited resources. In addition, the
monitoring indicators in project documents were not consistent, and some discrepancies
remained until the project closed.

84.     These shortcomings of an otherwise well-designed project make its quality at
entry rating Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision: Moderately Unsatisfactory

85.      The Bank supervision team was led by a lead specialist in rural finance and
consisted of another experienced rural finance specialist and operations officer as a core
team complemented by fiduciary, safeguards, and other specialists. The core team stayed
intact throughout the project except for one change in October of 2008, when the second
rural finance expert in the team took the leadership role with the departure of the previous
Task Team Leader (TTL). This continuity allowed the team to remain constantly attuned
to the project’s issues, to identify obstacles early, and to inform Bank management and
the Borrower of all problems that the project was facing. The supervision missions were
carried out regularly, twice a year, and all mission Aide Mémoires reported in detail the
problems identified and solutions proposed. When warranted, the team demonstrated



                                            21
flexibility and proactively undertook the efforts necessary to restructure the project or to
cancel unused portions of the loan.

86.     During the Mid-term Review in April 2008, the team was ready to cancel the
project and had preliminary agreement with the implementing agency. Subsequent
considerations at higher levels of the Government of Kazakhstan caused the option of
project cancellation to be dropped, and the project underwent the first restructuring to (i)
introduce an advance disbursement mechanism for the PFIs; (ii) provide working capital
financing under the credit line; and (iii) increase the sub-loan size from US$ 100,000 to
US$1,000,000. The Bank also remained overly optimistic about the credit demand
situation and could have worked toward an earlier partial cancellation. The Bank
supervision team did not address the issue of project indicators in the early years, and
some inconsistencies persisted until the end of the project despite the mentioned
restructurings. The problems were identified in a timely way and reported in the Aide
Mémoires and ISRs.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance: Moderately
Unsatisfactory

87.     Given some shortcomings at entry and supervision, and respective ratings at each
stage, overall Bank performance is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance: Unsatisfactory

88.     As described in paragraphs 29–32, economic factors played a critical role in the
performance of the project, particularly in the implementation of its credit line. The 2008
shock—a crisis on a global scale—was beyond the government’s control. Adjusting to a
financial crisis of such scale and depth was not possible within a short period, and the
banking sector remained in a condition that was not conducive to success in
implementing the project’s credit line, which eventually led to the project’s unsatisfactory
performance. With due consideration of these circumstances, however, it should be noted
that the government was slow to implement actions that were fully under its control, in
particular actions related to the delays with approval of various documents, provision of
co-financing, and micromanagement of the actions taken by the implementing agency
(Ministry of Agriculture) to implement the project. In general, it was felt that even though
the government appeared to be interested and committed to the project at the preparation
stage, that commitment was not so obvious during the implementation phase.

89.    Delays with ratification and effectiveness of the Loan Agreement and the
subsequent changes to the budget legislation put the project implementation on hold for
extended periods, slowing the positive momentum achieved at the end of APPAP-1,
which closed in 2002. Protracted delays with approval of the Subsidiary Loan
Agreements, especially at the early stages of the project, held disbursement of the credit
line back for many months. Had the Subsidiary Loan Agreements with the interested
banks been approved soon after project effectiveness, a number of initially interested


                                            22
PFIs could have participated in the credit line and utilized some funds early on. The long
bureaucratic procedures for approval of necessary changes to the project documents, such
as project restructurings or changes to the project’s feasibility study, put the project off
track and caused it to fail to achieve its objective. Some improvement in the approval
processes was noted after 2008, although it was still quite slow. In addition, the
government suspended financing of the project for several months in 2008 and later in
2011 because of the need to review the project’s performance. While project activities
resumed after these reviews, they also contributed to further delays in implementation.

90.      On the co-financing side, at negotiations the government cut half of the project’s
operating budget and reduced the budget allocated for agricultural risk management
activities. As a result, the project experienced difficulties with staffing, office space, and
travel to project sites. Local personnel involved in project implementation were not
allowed to use air transport but had to use ground transport only, which made monitoring
very difficult given the geographical scale of the country. Insufficient allocation of
resources from the state budget led to cancellation of price risk control activities and
curtailment of the production risk control activities under the project.

91.     At the operational level, even though the Ministry of Agriculture was designated
as the implementing agency, the Ministry of Finance was unduly micromanaging the
project, especially during its first half. For example, approval of the consultants Terms of
Reference, purchase of computers for the TOC, even a connection to the phone line
required the Ministry of Finance’s clearance. These interventions all caused unnecessary
delays and operational difficulties for the TOC, and they also undermined the Ministry of
Agriculture’s role as implementing agency.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance: Moderately Unsatisfactory

92.     The departmental-level staff members of the Ministry of Agriculture who were
responsible for the project were actively involved in the preparation and implementation
process. They regularly met with the Bank’s project team and were often for the Bank
team the only contact point with the government. Overall, the Ministry of Agriculture put
considerable effort into implementing the project, and its achievements should be
attributed to their persistence and active cooperation. Some shortcoming, however, need
to be mentioned, including the absence of an adequate project accounting system for an
extended period; failure to install the 1C accounting software and reliance on an Excel-
based manual system; no reporting until the end of September 2008; delays in submitting
subsequent reports; and delays in submitting audit reports. The audit reports were all
clean, however; nor were any procurement issues reported.

93.    It should also be noted that it took a long time for the Ministry of Agriculture to
provide the TOC with adequate working conditions. Keeping the team away from the
ministry’s premises led to poorer communication and coordination of daily work between
the consultants and the ministry’s supervising staff. The TOC was not supervised and
financed properly to monitor the project’s progress. Likewise, the TOC did not receive
from the Ministry of Agriculture the necessary support for timely clearance by the



                                             23
Ministry of Finance or Ministry of Economy for various project documents. Despite the
overall commitment of the top management of the implementing agency and its
designated department, some other units, notably the legal department, reportedly failed
to provide constructive support for implementation and often presented considerable
bureaucratic impediments to implementation.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance: Moderately
Unsatisfactory

94.   Taking into account the major factors that affected the project’s implementation
but were outside the government’s control, as well as the efforts of the implementing
agency to implement the project in a difficult environment, it is proposed to rate the
Borrower’s performance as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

95.    In Adaptable Program Loans, the success of one phase does not necessarily lead
to success in the next phase. Changes in the economic situation and level of government
commitment arising from the changing circumstances significantly affect project
performance. New activities included in the follow-up phase may create additional
challenges for implementation.

96.     It is important to have clear and measurable outcome indicators for the project.
They need to be systematically monitored to keep the focus on achieving project
objectives. Unclear PDO indicators or a lack of focus on outcomes causes
underachievement of the project objectives.

97.     A proactive approach and flexibility in the Bank and government to adapt to
changing circumstances are critical for the success of the project. Problems need to be
identified early and measures taken on time to put the project on track.

98.    When the project is not moving well and reasonable efforts to fix the situation do
not yield results, the Bank and Borrower should be ready to cancel the project when
warranted.

99.    A properly designed and implemented M&E system is important for the project’s
success. It is important, therefore, when designing an M&E system, to take into account
the nature of the project and the logistical requirements of the M&E (APPAP-2 was a
nationwide project working with a wide number of private sector beneficiaries in a vast
country with correspondingly large travel distances).

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Rural Financial Advisory Services aimed at building awareness among
farmers about business planning and financing options through the establishment and
engagement of a private financial consultants’ network.

Under this component, an international consultancy company was hired to organize and
administer the logistics for training. Six individual trainers (of whom three had
international experience) were engaged in training and testing 60 oblast-level consultant-
trainers, who were selected in a competitive manner by announcing the selection via
Kazakhstanskaya Pravda and regional newspapers.

In the next step, the oblast consultants conducted training and certification of 603 rayon-
level consultants. The recruitment of rayon consultants was done via announcements in
the local newspapers, information bulletins of farm associations and cooperatives, as well
as through akimats. 26 The consultants were recruited mostly from the joint-stock
company KazAgroMarketing, the Farmers’ Union of Kazakhstan, the Fund for Financial
Support of Agricultural Producers, the Chamber of Trade and Industry, as well as among
farmers. The selected participants then passed through training and certification in
business planning, types of financial products, legal issues, and taxation.

Overall, 162 information seminars were held countrywide to increase awareness among
farmers and rural people about financial advisory services and to stimulate their
entrepreneurial activity. Some 18,246 people attended these seminars; about 11,800 of
them later used the rayon consultants’ services. Depending on the region, population
density, and other characteristics, each consultant received from 6 to 79 requests from
clients. As a result, 4,965 new business plans were prepared.

interest from clients in financial advisory services under the project faded after they saw
that their hopes for financing their ideas did not materialize. Thus, despite having been
implemented quite well on its own, the component’s outputs were not streamlined into
the overall project outcome because of problems with the implementation of other
components.

Component 2: Agricultural Risk Management (US$1.924 million, all government
financed) consisted of two sub-components:

     1. Sub-component 1: Production Risk Management (US$1.424 million) to improve
        the crop insurance program through technical assistance, upgrading of weather
        data infrastructure, and training of agro-meteorologists, farmers, insurance
        companies, and other actors.
     2. Sub-component 2: Price Risk Management/Market Efficiency (US$0.5 million) to:
         Advise the government on technical, financial, organizational, and regulatory
            aspects of a modern commodity exchange.
         Train potential investors, commodity exchange managers, regulators, key
            companies, and agents and build mass awareness using various channels.

allocation. Because there was not enough budget to recruit qualified international

consultants and because of the subsequent government decision to remove responsibility
from the Ministry of Agriculture for the development of agricultural commodity
exchanges, the sub-component of price risk management was dropped from the project at
the government’s request.

Under the first sub-component, two attempts to select an international consultancy
company with experience in agricultural insurance failed because the financial proposal
from the consultants was well above the available budget, while an excessive reduction in
the scope of the work to fit the budget would have undermined the purpose of the major
consultancy assignment. As a result, it was decided to hire only a local consultancy
company while additional expert support was provided by the World Bank.

Because of the changes, the original output indicators were not met, but instead were
replaced by new indicators through project restructuring.

Two insurance experts hired by the World Bank under a separate Trust Fund and the
local consultancy company Arka Consulting, hired under the project, carried out the
study of the agricultural insurance system in the country with detailed focus on eight
oblasts: Kosatanay, Akmola, Northern Kazakhstan, Eastern Kazakhstan, Western
Kazakhstan, Pavlodar, Karaganda, Aktiubinsk, and Southern Kazakhstan. The study
included:
     Analysis of the existing grain production systems.
     Analysis of the existing agricultural insurance system (legislative basis, technical
        characteristics, and financial results).
     Assessment of weather risk for grain production.
     Recommendations for improvement of the insurance system.
     Modernization of meteorological stations in 6 pilot rayons.
     Some training for people involved in the agricultural insurance system.

The study revealed technical and financial problems facing the existing system. Because
of its mandatory nature but limited coverage of any losses that occur, farmers try to buy
the minimum possible level of insurance just to meet the obligation to have insurance.28
For their part, the commercial insurance companies are not interested in the scheme and
are not supporting it because all of the insurance terms are set by the government. The

     It is estimated that 74 percent of the planted area is covered by insurance.


                                                              30
companies involved29 are being subjected to huge risks in the case of major crop failures,
because the system does not allow for reinsurance. In fact, in four of six years in 2005–10,
the system experienced financial losses. There is a need to adopt a new and differentiated
method for the calculation of insurance premiums. As it is presently designed, the system
has proved completely unsustainable for Aktiubinsk and Western Kazakhstan oblasts.

The findings of the study were presented and discussed in a seminar on July 21, 2011.
The participants included representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fund for
Financial Support of Agriculture, Kazakh Research Institute on Agricultural Economics
and Rural Development, KazHydroMet, insurance companies, and farms. The
participants have recommended to the Ministry of Agriculture that it establish a
committee consisting of representatives of all involved parties to develop amendments to
the Law on Mandatory Crop Insurance, taking into account the findings and
recommendations of the study done under the project.

To learn from the international experience in crop insurance schemes, a study tour was
organized to Spain for representatives of the insurance companies and relevant
government agencies (16 people). The intensive eight-day study tour organized by
AGROSEGURO (Association of Agricultural Insurance Companies of Spain) included:
   (i) Classroom training covering such topics as an overview of the insurance system
            in Spain, its legal basis, a review of insurance products, insurance
            management, insurance contracts, and information technologies in the
            insurance business, among other topics.
   (ii) Visits to and meetings with players in Spain’s insurance market: ENESA (State
            Agricultural Insurance Agency under the Ministry of Agriculture), Consorcio
            de Compensación de Seguros (CCS), Dirección General de Seguros (DGS),
            insurance companies, and farm associations.
   (iii)Field visit to livestock and grain farms, the clients of the insurance system.

To improve weather monitoring and to close some gaps in the existing network of
meteorological stations and posts, the project procured and installed 5 automatic weather
stations and 16 automatic weather posts in 6 pilot rayons (Table A2.5).

Component 3: Rural Outreach by the Mainstream Financial Sector (US$ 85.304
million) to help commercial banks and leasing companies accelerate rural investment
lending through traditional loans and by expanding the use of nontraditional instruments
like leasing of agricultural machinery and structured finance. The component had two
sub-components: Technical Assistance and Credit Line Facility.

The Technical Assistance sub-component aimed to increase the capacity of the
commercial banks and leasing companies in long-term agricultural lending and to
introduce them to new financing instruments. The training under this sub-component
meant to facilitate the implementation of the credit line facility sub-component. As such,
a wide number of commercial banks, leasing companies, and other relevant institutions
were involved in the training (Table A2.6).

The training sessions were delivered by ABTC, with involvement of two international
and four local experts. Under two broad themes (Investment Lending and Structured
Finance), training covered such topics as special features of long-term agricultural
financing, credit risk assessment, loan structuring and pricing, collateral valuation, supply
chains and supply chain financing, warehouse receipts and insurance, contract farming,
and credit monitoring, among others. Overall, 808 people were trained, including credit
specialists and bank branch managers (Table A2.7). Although only two banks eventually
participated in the implementation of the credit line sub-component, it is believed that the
training received by other banks contributed to the expansion and/or improvement of
their lending portfolios, although the magnitude of this impact could not be quantified or
reasonably assessed.

The participants reported very high levels of satisfaction with the relevance, quality, and
usefulness of the training. On a 10-point scale, the overall score given by participants on
the course evaluation forms was 9.4. Particularly positive feedback was received on the
trainers’ preparation (9.9) and their teaching methods (9.8), which involved a
combination of lecturing, practical case studies, and class discussions.

It should be noted that the materials obtained from these training courses continue to be
used by the banks in their internal training programs for new staff. The ABTC reportedly
has growing demand for its training programs, partly owing to the successful delivery of
training sessions under the project.

The Credit Line Facility sub-component experienced difficulties in implementation for
various reasons mentioned in the main text. As a result, out of US$ 30.0 million from the
IBRD loan allocated for this sub-component, the sum of US$ 23,474,500 was cancelled.

To select PFIs, banks were invited to participate five times over the course of the project.
Many banks showed no interest in the project’s credit line, partly because cheaper funds
were provided under the various government-financed programs. A few interested banks
could not meet the eligibility criteria for financial performance. Consequently, only two
commercial banks participated in the credit line.

Overall, 83 sub-loans were issued, of which 38 were for agriculture or agri-processing
(Tables A2.8 and A2.9). They were financed by US$ 6.391 million from the IBRD and
KZT 940.836 million from the government co-financing. The average interest rate on
sub-loans was in the range of 12–14 percent, with maturities of one to three years.
Geographically the sub-borrowers were from the following oblasts: Northern Kazakhstan,
Aktiubinsk, Kostanay, Jambyl, Southern Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Atyrau, and Eastern
Kazakhstan.

Component 4: Rural Micro Finance Development (US$5.372 million) had two sub-
components: Technical Assistance and Micro Credit Facility.

Under the Technical Assistance sub-component, initially 27 MFIs applied for
participation in the project. Even though some of them did not meet the selection criteria
(for example, they were too small), they were allowed to participate in the training. Later
the number of MFIs that applied for participation in the project reached 83. However,
because of high interest in the sector generated by the project’s training activities, other
MFIs were also allowed to participate. As a result, 310 people from 146 MFIs
participated in the training sessions. In addition, selected MFIs received on-site technical
assistance. The training topics included: strategic and business planning, credit cycle
management, internal control, risk management, new product development, transparency
and financial reporting, and linkage to commercial banks, among others. The training
sessions were highly rated by the participants, scoring 3.7 out of 4.0.

During the technical assistance to individual MFIs, the most frequently discussed topics
were:
   1. Management of problem credits
   2. Calculation of key financial indicators
   3. Credit policy
   4. New microcredit products
   5. Calculation of portfolio at risk
   6. Business planning
   7. Client financial statements
   8. Assessment of creditworthiness of a client
   9. Special features of rural credit policy



                                                                36
     10. MicroFin software for credit specialists
     11. Calculation and analysis of loan loss provisions
     12. MFI rating and finding of donors
     13. Marketing strategy development
     14. International practice in staff bonus systems
     15. Client risk assessment ratios
     16. Selection and assessment of clients
     17. Monitoring of active clients
     18. International experience in MFI operations

Technical assistance included initial diagnostics of the beneficiary MFI and subsequent
development of recommendations for improvement. MFIs that diligently implemented
the recommendations showed improvements in their operations. Four achieved the level
of overall performance that would qualify them for borrowing from commercial banks.

Other activities included organization for the weaker MFIs of study tours to the most
successful MFIs in the country. For the public officials responsible for the development
of the microfinance sector, a study tour was organized to India.

AMFOK was both a vehicle for delivering training and also the beneficiary of technical
assistance. The project helped to build AMFOK’s institutional capacity, build contacts
with the MFIs, expand its membership by 5 MFIs, and gain visibility and offers to
participate in other projects. For example, AMFOK was invited to implement the
Planning for the Future Project by the Microfinance Center (Poland), a social project
aimed at increasing the financial literacy of both MFIs and their clients.

The Micro Credit Facility sub-component was cancelled due to delays in implementation
and absence of interest from commercial banks. On the other hand, the MFIs were either
not qualified to access the Micro Credit Facility or not interested in it, as they could get
cheaper funding from investors abroad. For those reasons, the training and capacity
building under the first sub-component did not result in any microcredit issued from the
project. Nevertheless, the development of MFIs under the project quite possibly had an
impact on the overall growth of the lending portfolio in the microfinance sector, although
exact attribution and quantification of this impact is not possible here.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

APPAP-2 aimed to create direct linkages between training farmers, strengthening local
advisory service providers, and strengthening rural financial services. Technical support
to farmers, service providers, PFIs, and other stakeholders was granted in the areas of: (i)
business planning, management, and monitoring; (ii) accounting and financial and credit
analysis; (iii) financial options and risk management; and (iv) legal and tax issues. The
credit line amounting to about KZT 1,903.92 million (US$ 12.96 million) was provided
to 83 farmers and entrepreneurs, mainly to finance seasonal agricultural/enterprise inputs
and replacement/upgrading of critical equipment and machinery. By region, the highest
share of borrowers was located in Kostanay Oblast (39.4 percent), followed by Aktobe
Oblast (12.6 percent) and South-Kazakhstan Oblast (10.8 percent). The average interest
rate ranged between 12 percent and 14 percent. The repayment rate of loans is estimated
at 98 percent.

Approach
The financial analysis focused on beneficiaries rather than on macro considerations such
as export earnings. The prime objective was to ascertain the viability of project activities,
particularly at the farm/enterprise level. An optimum number of representative borrowers
was identified to encompass the wide variation within the country and yet achieve a
reasonable degree of precision. Information was collected during field visits, discussions
with borrowers and PFIs, and a review of available reports. The results were compared
with those projected at appraisal. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to assess
the impact of various parameters on the financial returns.

Analysis
Thirteen project credits were analyzed (16 percent of borrowers), amounting to about
KZT 571 million (US$ 3.9 million) or 30 percent of the total credit line. The sample is
considered sufficient for the analysis to be extrapolated across the entire project. Detailed
data on the credits analyzed are presented in Table A3.1.

* The switching values show the percentage by which costs would need to rise or benefits decrease before the NPV
reaches zero, associated with each of the values (at 12% opportunity cost). Some models show that benefits after
financing would be positive beginning in the first year; therefore no IRR could be calculated. NA =Not available.

Results
Tables A3.2 and A3.3 show the main results of the financial analysis. In summary: (i)
overall, gross, and net returns increased reasonably after loans were obtained; (ii)
benefit/cost ratios demonstrate the attractiveness of the investments; and (iii) the level of
profitability varied significantly between activities. Two credits had negative NPVs and


                                                                 40
are therefore not attractive for financing. Positive NPVs for the farms and enterprises
analyzed range from KZT 283,000 to KZT 460,000,000. IRRs range from 13 percent to
975 percent. These IRRs are much higher in comparison to the numbers projected during
appraisal: NPVs between KZT 84,000 and KZT 41,000,000; IRRs between 13 percent
and 50 percent. Favorable cash flows from the most analyzed investments indicate that
the project credit line would continue revolving effectively even after closure.

Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis was undertaken to assess the impact on financial returns of changes
in: (i) output prices; (ii) expected outputs; (iii) operating costs; (iv) interest rate; and (v)
investment costs. The analysis showed that credits are more sensitive to changes in both
outputs and price assumptions than they are to variations in investment, operating costs,
and interest rate. However, they remain reasonably sound in revenue terms.

Summary of findings
 Although large farms have higher net incomes and cash flows, they commonly have
  lower cost/benefit ratios compared to medium and small farms.
 Farms/enterprises are more sensitive to changes in output and price assumptions than
  they are to variations in investment, operating costs, and interest rates.
 Farms with diversified production are more profitable and less risky.
 Optimal use of available resources, diversification and/or a combination of various
  activities, appropriate marketing, and risk management are keys to successful
  business and assured loan repayments.

No formal economic analysis was undertaken at appraisal due to the uncertainty of the
scope and types of loans. Moreover, the need for economic analysis is justified by the
presence of significant distortions in the economy. However, agricultural reforms in
Kazakhstan are well advanced, and there is little rationale for an overall economic
analysis, as all major distortions between domestic and border prices essentially have
been removed. Nevertheless, with an average net incremental income at US$ 0.66 for
each dollar borrowed, the total NPV of the credit line of US$ 12.96 million could be
estimated at about US$ 16.5 million. The appraisal estimated a much higher NPV, at
about US$ 50.1 million. The shortfall is explained by significant underutilization of the
credit line.

Fiscal impact
Incremental recurrent costs after the project’s completion are envisaged only for
operation and maintenance of meteorological equipment. This cost amounts to about
US$ 125,000 per year or less than 0.1 percent of state expenditures on agriculture in 2012.
The equipment has been officially transferred to the balance sheet of Kazhydromet under
the Ministry of Environmental Protection, and a sufficient budget has been allocated for
operation and maintenance.

        Brief report on outcomes of implementation of the Second Agriculture Post-
                          Privatization Assistance Project

          Being implemented by MOA and the World Bank since 2006, the Second
Agriculture Post Privatization Assistance Project (APPAP II) is aimed at improving the
sustainability of the agricultural crediting system, stabilization of profitability of
agricultural enterprises based on availability of more affordable long-term credits in the
agricultural sector and improved access of farmers, small and middle-sized commodity
producers to information, consultations and training on the basis of development of the
financial consulting services system.
          The project was implemented under the Loan Agreement concluded between
the Republic of Kazakhstan and the World Bank ratified by Law of the Republic of
Kazakhstan of December 14, 2005 No. 99.
          The total project cost is US$21.918 million, out of which:
           US$8.525 million – proceeds from the IBRD loan;
           US$13.393 million – funds of the Republican budget (RB).
          The Project Structure consists of two areas:
          Technical assistance co-financed from the Republican budget;
          The credit line which was implemented through participating financial
institutions at the expense of funds of the Republican budget and the World Bank loan.

          The principal objectives of the Project are:
           Building capacity for viable rural businesses through strengthening and
expanding the rural financial services;
           Supporting agricultural risk management initiatives and improving
marketing efficiency;
           Facilitating the development and implementation of new financial
instruments by commercial banks and leasing companies for deepening rural financial
outreach;
           Supporting sustainable development of rural businesses that are currently
excluded from the formal banking sector.
          
          The main participants in the Project are:
           The Republic of Kazakhstan represented by the Ministry of Finance which
provides co-financing of the Technical Assistance program under the project and MOA
appointed as the Project Manager;
           The World Bank, which provides the long-term loan in the form of a credit
line, supports the technical assistance program for rural outreach by the mainstream
financial institutions and rural micro finance development;
           PFI, involved local commercial banks: Eurasian Bank, Bank CenterCredit as
well as micro-financial organizations which provide partial co-financing of Project credit


                                           46
resources directly to beneficiaries – agricultural small and medium-sized businesses;
          Representatives of small and medium-sized business operating in the
agricultural sector that guarantee their own contribution if Project credit funds are
allocated for implementation of their own investment projects.

      APPAP-II is the continuation of the three-stage 10-years joint program of the RK
Government and the World Bank for Agriculture Post-Privatization Assistance. APPAP-1
which took effect on October 23, 1998 and was completed on July 31, 2003 was focused
on laying a legal foundation, establishment of institutes and development of procedures
aimed at supporting the improvement of efficiency of agricultural enterprises and
providing loans to commercially viable re-structured enterprises.
      The Project has been implemented since March 2006. At that moment, the Project
cost was US$ 70.4 million.
      Terms and conditions of project implementation are regulated by the following
documents:
1. The Loan Agreement (the Second Agriculture Post-Privatization Assistance Project)
    between the Republic of Kazakhstan and the International Bank for Reconstruction
    and Development (Loan No. 4763 KZ);
2. Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 139 of February 23,
    2007;
3. Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan No. 969 of October 19,
    2007;
4. The Feasibility Study (FS) executed during the preparation of the Loan Agreement;
5. The project operational and crediting manuals prepared by project consultants on the
    basis of the above documents, coordinated with RK MOA and the World Bank.
      During the project implementation due to external circumstances, the project
Feasibility Study was amended three times, as a result its cost changed to US$ 21.918
million.
      At an early stage of the project, the Project Operational Manual coordinated with
IBRD, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Finance was developed. The
Manual determines roles of all participants in the project and the procedure for
implementation of project components.
      To perform works under the project, a team of consultants selected in accordance
with IBRD procedures was established.
      The Project goals were expected to be achieved under 4 basic components of the
Project:
       Rural financial advisory services;
       Agricultural risk management;
       Rural outreach by the mainstream financial institutions, including the credit line
offered through second-tier banks and leasing companies in the total amount of US$60
million; and
       Rural micro finance development, including the credit line for a total amount of
US$4.750 million for crediting of micro-financial institutions.
      It is worth noting that the credit and micro-credit line (in which participation of
borrowing banks, micro-financial institutions and leasing companies was planned)
accounted for 94 % of the Project cost.

                    Component 1. Rural financial advisory services

        The component was aimed at attaining two objectives: (i) instill in farmers the
general awareness of the need to develop feasible business ideas and seek financing
required for their materialization; and (ii) establishment of a nation-wide sustainable
private financial advisory system. The basic differences between APPAP-1 and APPAP-
2 approaches include: (i) shift of focus to development of local advisory capacities
(individual consultants, workers of consulting firms); training and certification are carried
out under the project; however, consultants will work independently of the project; (ii)
support of the trainer’s network for training of consultants; (iii) certification of
consultants through examinations; and (iv) engagement of the training management
company for assistance in its implementation.
        In accordance with the Feasibility Study for implementation of this component in
2007 and with application of IBRD procedures, FASET, BV, the Netherlands, (with
which a contract for the sum of 128.583 million tenge was concluded) and the following
international and local consultants were selected:
1. Business planning - G. Arymkulova (LC) and N. Kaskatayev (NC);
2. Taxation and legal aspects - M. Bobukeyeva (LC) and A. Darinov (NC);
3. Financial products - A. Patel (LC) and A. Dogalov (NC).
         Under the component the following works were performed:
    1. 60 oblast trainers - consultants, 600 raion consultants were trained.
    2. 4965 new business plans were developed for farmers.
    3. 185 awareness raising workshops were arranged and held jointly with raion
         akimats, the total number of participants is 18249 farmers;
    4. Re-certification (re-attestation) of trainers - consultants and local consultants.
        Training seminars under components 1, 2 and 3 of the project were held.
         On their part, all beneficiaries (farmers, specialists of banking and micro-financial
sectors) were interviewed for assessment of qualification of trainers - consultants, quality
and availability of training materials, work of trainers with audiences and arrangement of
activities, results of which were used to determine the average score of training which by
all above components was assessed from 3.7 to 4 points with a maximum score of 4
points.
         The analysis demonstrated that subject matters of held workshops are in high
demand of specialists employed in agriculture. A large number of specialists and the
entire audience stipulated by the Terms of Reference were covered by training.
      It was planned to hold 120 one-day information workshops for farmers. Actually,
162 workshops were held.
      The actual number of farmers and commodity producers who got consultations was
11 800. During 3 years, a total of 18246 farmers and agricultural commodity producers
was trained. Over fulfilment by the number of held information workshops is due to the
interest of farmers in obtaining additional information under the component.
          During the period from November 3 to November 20, 2009, trainings were
provided in re-attestation of raion and oblast consultants. International and national
consultants were involved in re-attestation of consultants.
      Re-certification (re-attestation) of local consultants




                                             49
      LC certification began in November 2009, 18 workshop on certification were held;
603 LCs were invited and 575 actually attended. The re-attestation contained a training
element held by individual, national and international consultants. As a whole, more than
95 % of LC passed examination.
      Re-certification of instructors - consultants
      Re-certification of IC was carried out in Astana instead of four regional workshops
as it had been originally planned. Examinations were conducted for IC; re-certification
took place on November 20 at the beginning of the final workshop. Results were positive;
all IC passed examination; the majority scored high points.
      The final workshop
      The final workshop was held in the building of the Ministry of Agriculture in
Astana on November 20, 2009. The workshop was preceded by meetings between
international and national consultants and IC invited on the eve, on November 19. During
these meetings, consultants discussed the Project progress and further development of
advisory services for agricultural financing.
      The final workshop was held for 60 IC (or LC who replaced IC), international and
national consultants, and about 60 invited visitors from various organizations connected
with agriculture. Among other invited were Mr. T.D.Urazov, Country Office of the
World Bank, and Mr. A. Loeff, the Managing Director of Triodos Facet, and a
representative of the Eurasian Bank. The latter briefly informed about conditions of loan
provision under the credit line and timeframe of expert examination of the loan carried
out by the Eurasian Bank. One of main challenges is the method for evaluation by the
bank of collateral offered by farmers to secure credits.
      The summary of project progress, including data on performance indicators and
results of monitoring, are presented in the Table below.
      The number of farmers’ requests for services increased everywhere: almost in all
oblasts international consultants noted an increased demand for advisory services in the
agricultural sector. On the average, each LC received requests from 6 to 79 new clients,
i.e. farmers. Fluctuations are high, but not unexpected: some oblasts possess more
advanced agricultural production capacity than others; LC interests and qualifications
also vary. Nevertheless, it is a good result which demonstrates an increased demand for
advisory services. Besides almost all LC noted that the number of requests of farmers
increased; the lowest share was demonstrated by western oblasts, whereas oblasts with
strong agricultural production and high number of LC reached almost 100 % outcome.
      There was an essential increase in the number of business plans developed during
the Project: a total of 4965 new business plans were developed during the project
implementation. It is a very good result and a strong indicator of both increase in
demand and in the level of confidence of farmers in LC capacities.

      A significant number of completely developed business plans was financed by
banks and other financial institutions; in this area the data vary highly by oblasts. In some
oblasts it is 20 %, in others may be 45 %. To a considerable degree, this is due to
availability of financial institutions and offers they can make. In those regions where
banks and other financial organizations are active and effective, results are accordingly
better.

                     Component 2. Agricultural risk management

       In Kazakhstan, the Law on mandatory insurance in crop production was adopted
in 2004 (Law of the Republic of Kazakhstan of 10.03.2004 No. 533-II On mandatory
insurance in crop production). It was assumed that later as insurants and insurers would
be acquiring skills and experience, the insurance system itself would improve. In recent
years, serious problems were identified in the agricultural insurance system. Its main
drawbacks are unprofitability, high level of underinsurance, corruption and complexity of
obtaining payments for insured accidents.

        The objective of the Agricultural risk management component was to study
the condition of insurance in crop production in Kazakhstan and to make
recommendations for its improvement and development.
        In this area, since December 2010, Kazakhstan company LLP «Arca Consulting»
and international consultants of the World Bank on agricultural insurance (Ramiro
Iturrios, Charles Stutely and Andrea Stoppa) conduct research.
        The goal of the research is to review the current situation, identify drawbacks and
advantages, develop framework for improvement of the insurance system in crop
production in Kazakhstan.
        The research covered Kostanay, Akmola, North-Kazakhstan, East-Kazakhstan,
West-Kazakhstan, Pavlodar, Karaganda, Aktyubinsk and South-Kazakhstan oblasts.

        Under the component, the following main types of works were performed:
     Review of performance of agricultural production, namely grain production, with
        description of main agricultural production systems;
     Review of the current insurance system in crop production in Kazakhstan, namely
        legal framework, performance, technical and financial outcomes;
     Analysis of weather risk in grain production;
     Development of proposals and recommendations for improvement of the
        insurance system in crop production;
     Modernization of the weather monitoring system in 6 pilot areas in 3 oblasts;
     Training of specialists involved in the insurance system in crop production.
     All these types of works were aimed at solving problems in the insurance system in
    crop production.
        LLP «Arka Consulting» and international consultants presented findings of their
research during workshops of the Ministry of Agriculture held on July 21 and on
November 8, 2011. During the workshop held on November 8 they suggested following a
stage-by-stage plan for improvement of the insurance system in the area of crop


                                             51
production. The workshop decided to recommend to the RK MOA Commission on
Insurance in Agriculture that findings of the research be applied for improvement of the
legal framework on insurance.
         In the framework of the Modernization of the weather monitoring system in 6
pilot raions selected on the recommendation of the Department of Agriculture of the
Ministry of Agriculture and coordinated with Kazhydromet, the following activities were
carried out:
  1. Modernization of 5 existing weather stations with installation of MAWS301
      automatic weather stations;
  2. Establishment in 16 communities of automatic weather posts (AWP) with
      installation of MAWS110 automatic weather stations;
  3. Provision of 3 oblast centers of hydrometeorology (Kostanay, Akmola, Pavlodar)
      with Delta mobile soil hydrometers, UK;
  4. Modernization of weather information collection centers in 3 oblast centers of
      hydrometeorology.
      Implementation of these activities made it possible:
    • To ensure complete coverage of agricultural areas in pilot raions by weather
      monitoring;
    • To issue reliable weather information in case of weather hazards (insured accident);
    • To computerize processes of observation, transmission, collection and processing of
      weather data;
    • To measure soil humidity with mobile soil hydrometers promptly and reliably;
    • To establish in 16 communities workplaces for technician agrometeorologists who
      will keep under observation the condition of agricultural crops on nearby fields.
      The weather monitoring system was modernized by LLP «SKYMAX
TECHNOLOGIES».
         Also under the project, 16 Kazakhstan specialists involved in the insurance
system in crop production were trained at the «AGROSEGURO» training center under
the Ministry of Agriculture of Spain (from 14th to 20th of November). Globally, the
Spanish agricultural insurance system along with Canada and the USA are considered the
most advanced and effective. The study tour was arranged by ATI of International
Professional Academy «TURAN-PROFI».
         As a whole, it is possible to state that works and activities planned under the
Production risk management component were performed.
         As a result of the review of the current insurance system in crop production, the
main three blocks of most relevant problems which hinder its development were
highlighted:
       1) A legislative problem which consists in the fact that the current law On
mandatory insurance in crop production contains many contradictions and problematic
issues that require solution and harmonization with accepted international practice of
insurance. This block determines the need to solve, first of all, such issues as: format of
agricultural insurance, insurance mechanism, management and control, etc.
      2) Ways of participation of the state in agricultural insurance. At present, the
existing state support is not effective and does not perform its functions; and no
institutional framework was established during the years of development of the
mandatory insurance system in crop production. No specialized institution was



                                            52
established to perform control and methodological function to ensure adequate state
support of the insurance system in agriculture. It is necessary to develop reliable
methodology for assessment of the capacity of the insurance market in agriculture,
consequently, the amount of budget funds required for state support of agricultural crop
insurance. It will make it possible to determine ways of participation of the state in the
insurance system and to develop institutional framework of this system at the level of the
state.
       3) Training of qualified specialists in agricultural insurance and information
work. This part includes the need for training of qualified specialists both out of public
employees of the Ministry of Agriculture and other official agencies and workers of
business entities involved in the agricultural insurance system. Besides, it is necessary to
carry out extensive information work among agricultural producers aimed at enhancing
knowledge and culture in the area of agricultural risk management in connection with
insurance. In addition, it is necessary to solve issues of interaction of such organizations
as Kazhydromet, the Agency on Statistics, insurance companies and others with regard to
timely information support of the agricultural insurance system.
         The international consultants of the World Bank highlighted the following
features of the insurance system which deserve further consideration:
1. Financial outcomes of the system of agricultural crop insurance which consists in
    issuing one-time policies worsened in recent years;
2. The state subsidy at a rate of 50 % of insurance requirement for payment to be made
    through the Fund of Financial Support to Agriculture (FFSA) for last 6 years (2005-
    2010) amounted to 4.1 billion tenge or on the average to 685 million tenge a year
    (in 2010 – 1.4 billion tenge), i.e. annual budget expenditures of the Government of
    Kazakhstan on the average were 685 million tenge a year.
3. Without Aktyubinsk and West-Kazakhstan oblast, budget expenditures of the
    Government of Kazakhstan would be 409 million tenge a year, thus 40 % would be
    saved;
4. In addition to budget expenditures, the Government of Kazakhstan covers operational
    expenses of the Fund of Financial Support to Agriculture, which on the average are
    46 million tenge a year.
3 stages of development of the insurance system in crop production were suggested:
Stage I: Short-term – Strengthening of the existing mandatory insurance system;
Stage II: Transition to market insurance system in crop production;
Stage III: Mid-term - Transformation into a commercial pool of the insurance system in
crop production.

At Stage I it is necessary to carry out the following activities:
   1. To strengthen the regulatory framework;
   2. To improve calculations and estimation of insurance premiums for policies;
       insurance against the risk of loss of capital investment;
   3. To take measures to increase profitability;
   4. To strengthen systems and methods of work;
   5. To strengthen organizational structures;
   6. The top limit of loss in case of natural disasters (protection against excess of loss);
   7. To consider the issues of subsidizing insurance premiums.



                                             53
The following recommendations are made:
    To introduce amendments into the legislation to enable insurance companies to
       establish conditions;
    To increase the amount of the insurance sum;
    To revise the methodology for calculation of insurance premiums in order to
       determine rates on the basis of actuarial calculations;
    To revise the methodology for calculation of insurance premiums in order to
       introduce rates of insurance premiums at the raion level;
    To consolidate terms and conditions of the existing insurance policy;
    To exclude WKO and Aktyubinsk oblast from the insurance system;
    To streamline and reduce expenditures for marketing, preliminary checks and
       procedures for loss assessment;
    To create incentives for private insurance companies to maintain the insurance
       system in crop production;
    To create equal conditions for commercial insurers and mutual insurance
       associations;
    To develop reinsurance protection on the basis of catastrophic excess of loss both
       for private insurance companies and for farmer mutual insurance associations, at
       the expense of their own contributions;
    To estimate whether farmers can afford increased rates in case of increase in the
       level of coverage as well as whether there is a need for state subsidies for
       insurance premiums.

At Stage II it is necessary to carry out the following activities:
   1. To introduction insurance of agricultural crops against multiple risks (MPCI) for
       individual producers;
   2. To introduce reinsurance protection on the basis of excess of loss in insurance of
       agricultural crops.
The following recommendations are made:
    To conduct research on insurance of agricultural crops against multiple risks and
       to develop an insurance product;
    To consider mechanisms of the state support for such a system;
    Disproportionate reinsurance on the basis of excess of loss for the MPCI program.

At Stage III it is necessary to carry out the following activities:
   1. To make transition to voluntary insurance of agricultural crops;
   2. To enhance the existing PPP in insurance of agricultural crops;
   3. To cover risks;
   4. To conduct research and develop insurance products;
   5. To strengthen operational systems and procedures;
   6. To introduce an official program for international reinsurance protection for the
       pool.
The following recommendations are made:
    To provide insurers with the possibility to choose risks (i.e. to choose
       independently, what farms, what crops and what regions they are ready to insure);



                                          54
       To establish links of insurance of agricultural crops with other services for
        farmers, for example: rural credits, governmental programs for assistance to
        farmers, etc.);
     The Kazakhstan PPP on agricultural insurance should clearly determine the roles
        of private players and the public sector;
     To establish a co-insurance pool in crop production among insurers engaged in
        insurance of other than lives;
     To introduce new insurance products in insurance of agricultural crops to widen
        the range of choices available to farmers;
     Increase competence in insurance of agricultural crops;
     To streamline systems of and procedures for assessment of losses/damage at the
        site in insurance of agricultural crops against multiple risks;
     The Government of Kazakhstan should assist insurers in purchase of shares,
        quotas and/or reinsurance on the basis of excess of loss to protect obligations
        arising out of risks stipulated by the co-insurance pool.
        Opportunities for development and introduction of new insurance products for
insurance in crop production:
    1. Insurance against stipulated risks (hailstones)
    2. Insurance by the area-based crop yield index
    3. Insurance by the weather index
        Conclusions and recommendations
        The stage-by-stage approach to transformation of the national mandatory
    insurance system in crop production based on capital investment losses into the
    market oriented system is recommended. Key characteristics of the process include:
       2004 Mandatory Law Reforming
              • To make insurance in crop production voluntary
              • To allow insurance companies to choose what crops to work with and in
               what areas they want to work.
              • To reconsider insurance for Aktyubinsk oblast and WKO in the future,
               having prepared a separate program for assistance in case of disasters
        Institutional reforming and strengthening:
              • To consider the possibility to introduce a pool of agricultural crop
               insurance
              • To create equal conditions for commercial insurance companies and MIA
        Technical strengthening:
              • To introduce the assessment of premiums based on actuarial calculations
               at the raion level
              • To introduce new insurance products and programs for insurance of
               marketable agricultural crops
        Financial strengthening and reinsurance:
              • To facilitate insurance market entry for international reinsurance
               companies (proportional and disproportionate reinsurance)
              • To reconsider the financial role of the RK Government (through FFSA),
               concerning the provision of support in the form of subsidizing insurance
               premiums.

           Component 3. Rural outreach by the mainstream financial institutions

         In accordance with the Agreement, the primary goals of component 3 included
training of specialists of banks and leasing companies in agricultural crediting; and
crediting, arrangement of transactions under the credit line in selected participating
financial institutions (hereinafter referred to as PFI). To attain these goals, the following
activities were implemented:
- Provision of technical assistance to PFI that included capacity building in regional
offices of banks and leasing companies by means of training in specific issues of rural
crediting, leasing and structural financing.
         For implementation of this component, on a competitive basis, a contact was
concluded with the Almaty Center for Banking Training» and international consultants
Enzo Maravita, Srinat Keshavan and national consultants who trained by 400 persons in
each area, including 280 credit specialists and 120 branch managers. A total of 808
persons was trained against 800 planned, so the goal to cover as many trained specialists
as possible with engagement of local consultants was attained. Training was provided in
the following subjects:
       1. Structural financing;
       2. Long-term financing of agricultural investments and leasing.
             Outcomes are shown in the following table:

       As a result of measures taken during the implementation of Component 3, the
Project ensured:
- Improvement in functional capabilities of 808 credit specialists and branch managers;
- Growth in general rural and agricultural crediting of commercial banks and leasing
companies by about 10 % a year;
- Increase in crediting of small and medium-sized rural enterprises by participating
commercial banks at the expense of their own funds.

                                       The credit line
        The credit line for financial sector, proceeds from which were designed for
crediting of private farms, agricultural companies and other rural enterprises. Credits
were provided on the basis of the Loan Agreement and the Guidelines on rural
investments for financial sector.
        Due to the fact that the Feasibility Study developed for the project had been
prepared before the adoption of new legal acts (the Budget and Tax Codes), additional
time was required to draft amendments, update the Guidelines on rural investments for
financial sector, introduce amendments into the Feasibility Study for the project and to
pass new coordination in the ministries and agencies, adopt a Resolution by the
Government. So, during the period of project implementation, amendments were
introduced twice into the Feasibility Study and the Guidelines on rural investments for
financial sector. In addition, various state programs with lower rates became operational
and created a certain competitive environment for the credit line implemented under the
APPAP-2 Project. Moreover, adequate implementation of the credit line was complicated
by the crisis of the banking system in 2008, as a result of which the majority of banks in
the Republic could not meet requirements set to PFI.
Two ways were provided for implementation of the credit line:
a) Refinancing of credits financed by PFI to achieve objectives of the Project (no
credits were provided under this scheme).
b) Making advance payments to PFI on condition that the disbursement period is
determined in ICA.
        Under this scheme, 2 banks (JSC «Eurasian Bank» and JSC «Bank Centrecredit»)
were credited.
        The average rate for sub-borrowers was about 12-14 %, out of which 7.5 % is the
refinancing rate of the RK National Bank and 4.5-6.5 % is bank margin; periods of
credits are from 1 year to 3 years. Sub-borrowers, in their turn, provided co-financing in
the amount of 25 % of the received credit; credit repayment risks were assigned to banks.
        Under the internal credit agreement No. 10BVU021 of 30.06.2009 concluded with
JSC «Eurasian Bank» and five additional agreements, US$5390.5 million of loan
proceeds and 794176 thousand tenge of co-financing were transferred. 74 credits were
provided to the following business entities:
          - Individual entrepreneurs – 22;
          - Peasant farms - 8;
          - Various LLP – 42;
          - Joint stock companies - 2.


                                           57
        31 project for development of agricultural producers, out of which 20 for
agricultural production (livestock production, crop production, poultry farming), 6 for
development of processing, storage, packing, sell of agricultural products and other
associated subsectors of agriculture, 5 for development of physical infrastructure of
agricultural production, were financed.

        In April 2010, internal credit agreement No. 10BVU026 was concluded with JSC
«Bank Centercredit», under which 1 tranche in the sum of 1000.0 thousand dollars from
loan proceeds and 146600.0 thousand tenge of co-financing funds were transferred. 9
credits, out of which 7 were designed for investment in agricultural production, were
provided. Credits were distributed with the following breakdown: individual entrepreneur
- 1, peasant farm – 1, LLP - 7.

       As a whole, under the project, during the period from 2007 to 2011, 83
subprojects for a total amount of 1903920 thousand tenge were financed for
replenishment of working capital, modernization and purchase of equipment as well as
for other investment purposes. Subprojects were financed in North-Kazakhstan,
Aktyubinsk, Kostanay, Zhambyl, South-Kazakhstan, Karaganda, Atyrau and East-
Kazakhstan oblasts. Most credits were provided in the following regions: Kostanay,
South-Kazakhstan, North-Kazakhstan, East-Kazakhstan oblasts.

                       Component 4. Rural micro finance development

       The ultimate objective of the Rural micro finance development component is to
increase the portfolio of rural credits of selected micro-financial organizations and to
meet requirements for working capital and demand of small farmers and other rural
small/micro businessmen for small investment credits.
       To achieve this objective, it was suggested attaining the goal of strengthening
institutional capacities of individual PIFI by means of benchmark research to determine
initial project level and to provide technical assistance for diversification of micro-
crediting products and development of integration links, increase in the portfolio of rural
credits of micro-credit organizations. In addition, it was suggested creating a credit
facility and arranging operations under the microcredit line in individual PIFI.
       The component consists of two areas (subcomponents): (a) the technical assistance
program for improvement of functional capabilities of participating microfinancial
institutions – US$622 thousand; and (b) a microcredit line designed for financing of
short-term and mid-term credits for replenishment of working capital and investment
with a view to supporting sustainable rural microfinancing scheme in the sum of
US$ 4750 thousand, out of which proceeds from the World Bank loan are US$3650
thousand, funds of RB co-financing are US$1100 thousand.
       To perform works under the component, JSC «Association of Microfinancial
Organizations of Kazakhstan», international consultants Ruben Sammerlin and Michael
Wills (consultants on IFI institutional development), Amritkumar Patel (consultant on
rural microfinancing) and Tilman Brue (consultant on development of links with
commercial banks) as well as Roxana Savesku and Margarita Lalayan. The subject
matters of workshops were as follows:

                                     The microcredit line

      Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan of October 19, 2007
No. 969 determined basic conditions of implementation of the microcredit line of the
Project.
      The sum of credit is US$4.75 million, the currency of credit is tenge, the period of
credit is 12 years with a four-year grace period for repayment of the principal, the
interest rate is the refinancing rate of the National Bank. According to this document, the
main financial intermediary that allows microfinancial institutions to receive credit
resources from MCL proceeds of the Project should be the borrowing bank.
      In December 2009, an internal credit agreement was signed by RK MF, RK MOA
and the Agrarian Credit Corporation as the borrowing bank. To implement the
microcredit line, MCO should fully comply with general, financial prudential norms and
norms of corporate leadership and management. However, in connection with difficult
situation in the financial market at that time and due to the need to repay credit resources
to external investors and banks, large and sustainable microcredit organizations meeting
eligibility criteria refrained from obtaining proceeds of the microcredit line.
      The microfinancial organizations which submitted applications for funds were not
approved due to failure to meet financial and prudential norms determined by the Loan
Agreement.




                                            59
      In spite of the fact that the microcredit line «did not work», we believe that in the
future the organizations which took or will take part in financing of IFI will take into
account both positive aspects and weaknesses identified during project implementation.
      First of all, this is settlement of security issue, appropriate MCO assessment,
cooperation with MCO as socially-oriented organization, in the long run possible in the
capacity of partner, commercial agent.

                          Component 5. Project management

       The Head of the MOA Department of Investment Policy and External Relations
was responsible for daily project implementation; he was assisted by an ad hoc consultant
team. However, MOA DFS bore general responsibility for financial management,
including monitoring of cash flows funds and accounting. Categories of expenditures
under this component included material and technical support, office equipment and
additional operational costs incurred by MOA during implementation and monitoring of
the project.
        Based on positive experience of earlier implemented Feasibility Study projects,
PIU which directly performed all works stipulated by the project was established on a
competitive basis.
        Due to the fact that the financial manager of the project is the Ministry of Finance,
at early stages all Terms of Reference were coordinated with its departments. Actually,
only one employee in the Ministry of Finance was involved in control, which resulted in
significant delays in project implementation. Later the Ministry of Finance abandoned
irrelevant functions and design works were coordinated only by departments of the
Ministry of Agriculture supervising corresponding areas.
        Originally, the PIU manning table included 4 authorized positions responsible for
4 basic components of the project and the team leader (consultant – coordinator)
simultaneously worked on the agricultural risk management component. During the
project implementation, having reviewed the work of the unit, the project managers (the
Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Finance) arrived at a sound decision to
include a translator position into the PIU manning table.
        Salaries of consultants were regulated by the order of the Ministry of Finance
which approved the matrix of salary rates of consultants who work under projects of
international organizations. The approved salary rates turned out to be much lower than
in subordinated units of the Ministry of Agriculture or in businesses. This explains
personnel turnover in PIU.
        At the end of 2009, the above order of the Ministry of Finance was revoked and
the authority to establish salary rates for consultants was transferred to project managers.
This resulted in stabilization of the consultants staff.

4. Updating the Feasibility Study

       During the project implementation, for the purpose of rectifying the identified
problems and achieving better results, amendments were introduced into the Feasibility
Study of the project three times. As a result, the Price risk management subcomponent




                                             60
was cancelled from the project, the Agricultural risk management subcomponent was
considerably reduced and changes were made in the crediting scheme.
       The main problem which complicated the project implementation was due to the
2007-2010 global financial and economic crises which most of all affected the banking
system. The credit line of the project was uncalled which led to incomplete project
implementation
