MEMORANDU0 AND RECOMPIENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND 0EVELOP`::;T
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE HUNGARIAN PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
FOR A SECOND TRANSPORT PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Ht-ngarian People's Republic for US$95 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for 15 years, including 5 years of
grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate, and would support the
Government's effoit of increasing the efficiency of the transport sector, by
cost reductions and improved management of operations and marketing systems.
2.       Background.  The transport system in Hungary is extensive and
diversified and consists of about 8,000 km of rail, 30,000 km of national
roads, 1,300 km of regularly navigable rivers and canals, one international
airport and a fairly large oil and gas pipeline network. Railways and roads
are the backbone of the transport system and together carry about 70% of total
freight traffic and more than 95% of passenger traffic. Major issues
affecting the sector relate to: (i) promoting greater competition within and
between different transport modes; (ii) promoting cost-based pricing and
reducing passenger transport subsidies; and (iii) improving operational
efficiency and productivity.
3.       The Government is now favoring structural change in transport
undertakings from the point of view of both ownership and size of
undertakings. The number of small and medium-sized undertakings has been
increasing and large monopolistic organizations are being split into smaller
units to make them more cost-effective. Within the framework of the
Government decision to encourage the private sector, private taxis and private
truckers are increasingly being licensed. The direct involvement of the
Ministry of Transport, Communication and Construction in the management of
transport enterprises and services is being gradually reduced. Enterprises
are now becoming increasingly free to choose and diversify their activities.
The railway managers have now increased freedom to implement innovations in
marketing and traffic operations. With the recent introduction of a two-tier
banking system, access to credit, including that for the transport sector, is
expected to improve the financial discipline of enterprises significantly.
4.       The Bank's first transport project in Hungary (Loan 2557-HU, June
1983) focused on alleviating critical problems affecting international/
national transport activity, specially concerning physical constraints in
infrastructure, equipment, vehicles and related maintenance. The project
served to improve procurement procedures by introducing ICB and improving
bidding documents, and to initiate important studies concerning road user
charges and improved mautagement information and marketing systems.



Concurrently, our dialogue with the Government and transport agencies has
resulted in agreement on transport development strategies which highlight:
(a) increased competition in the transport sector; (b) improved intermodal
services and interface facilities; (c) decreasing transport subsidies; (d)
reduction of uneconomic services, and (e) pricing, energy conservation, and
environmental considerations. The proposed Second Transport Project builds on
the on-going project and recommendations of the studies under it, and supports
the implemientation of the agreed transport development strategy.
5.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Government is keen to continue-
its Bank-assisted efforts in the transport sector, to improve competition and
operational efficiency, increase foreign exchange earnings by carrying more
traffic in international and trar.sit trade and promote technology transfer.
The Bank will also have the opportunity to follow up the implementation of
specific recommendations made in the studies initiated in the first transport
project such as increasing the use of improved technology to facilita,te
development of management information and marketing systems for
national/international freight, rationalization of road user charges and
treatment of uneconomic railway lines. The Bank has made progress in its
sector dialogue on policy/institutional issues, and the proposed project fully
addresses the major policy and institutional issues in the country involving
the investment program highlighting the restraints needed in specific cases
and the need to provide for adequate maintenance under the highway investment
program. The proposed second transport project would foster continued and
effective policy dialogue on these subjects and support the economic and
technical reforms in progress.
6.       Proiect Objectives.  The proposed project is designed to reduce
transportation costs, increase system-wide operational and maintenance
efficiency and increase foreign exchange earnings, through providing important
infrastructure, strengthening existing roads, increasing competition in
transport markets and upgrading transport technology, mainly in the areas of
management information and traffic control systems and equipment for both
maintenance of transport infrastructure and cargo handling. The project is
also intended to improve the environment in Budapest city due to diversion of
heavy commercial vehicles from the city to the M-O motorway (by-pass)
initiated under the first project.
7.       Project Description.  The proposed project includes high priority
investments covering:  (i) in railways: transport management information
system, a recycling plant for used rails and modernization of track
maintenance; (ii) in trucking: integrated computerized information system and
freight handling equipment for Hungarocamion; (iii) in highways: construction
of a 13.8 km extension of the M-O motorway which comprises a high priority
section of the future Budapest beltway, road strengthening and surface
treatment, and provision of road maintenance and testing equipment; (iv) in
urban passenger transport: traffic control system for the Budapest Transport
Company, and related technical assistance and training. In addition, three
studies, nAmely, a railway costing study, a river transport and port study and
a study of management and organization improvement of the Budapest Transport
Company are included in the Project.

8.       Proiect Cost and Financing.  The total cost of the project with
contingencies is estimated at about US$250 million with a foreign exchange
cost of about US$95 million. The Bank loan of US$95 million would cover about
38% of the total project cost. Local costs in the amount of US$155 million
would be financed from the Government budget (abotv. US$96 million) and from
the beneficiaries' internal resources (about US$59 million) . Estimated costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement are show.d in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Hungary
are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report
No.7390- HU and a map are also attached.
9.       Actiotns Agreed.  Understandings have been reached on ma,or policy
issues affecting the transport sector. Specifically, the following assurances
satisfactory to the Bank were obtained from the Government and the concerned
transport agencies: (i) Hungarian State Railway (MAV) would eliminate steam
traction by 1990; (ii) combined tariffs for multimodal services would be
introduced in 1990; (iii) MAV and Hungarocamion (HC) would establish and
introduce cost-based pricing systems by 1991; (iv) the regulatory system would
be improved to allow private transport companies to provide specialized
passenger services (minibuses, shared taxis, etc.) on a pilot basis by 1989;
(v) transport subsidies, expressed in constant prices, would be reduced from
the 1988 level by at least 50% during the years 1989 to 1993; (vi) MAV would
endeavor l.o reduce the total of staff, fuel and material costs by 52 (in real
terms) per unit of output during 1989-91; (vii) road user charges would be
further rationalized to ensure that heavy commercial vehicles pay by 1993
amounts reflecting the damage they cause to the infrastructure; (viii)
investments on railway electrification, new lines and track doubling would not
exceed 10% of MAV's total investment expenditure over the period from 1989 to
1995; (ix) proposed investments in the extension of the Budapest metro blue
line designed to replace in the early 1990's the rapid tramway system would be
deferred; (x) MAV would increase tariffs and control operating costs to
achieve a maximum operating ratio of 95% in 1990, reducing it by 1% each year
thereafter up to and including 1994; (xi) HC would maintain freight rates and
other charges at a sufficient level and control operating cost to ensure a
rate of return of not less than 22Z on average net fixed assets in operation
during each of the years from 1989 to 1993; (xii) BKV would maintain tariffs
and control operating costs at levels sufficient to achieve a maximum
operating ratios of 982 in each of the years 1989 to 1993;  (xiii) the funds
available for highway maintenance would be increased compared to 1988 by 10%
in 1989, 112 in 1990 and by 502 or more in real terms in the following years
to eliminate within a decade the accumulated backlog of maintenance; (xiv)
surcharges imposed on trucks exceeding the legal axle-load limit will be
revised to discourage over loading; (xv) a long-term road maintenance policy,
determining optimum funding levels, financing strategies, and technical
specifications will be formulated by December, 1990; and (xvi) the Government
would annually review with the Bank the progress made on various policy and
institutional matters, and take steps to meet the agreed targets.
10.      Benefits.  Major economic benefits under the proposed project are
expected from: (i) better utilization of existing assets such as rolling
stock and locomotives; (ii) reduction of empty haulage, improvement of load



factors for MAV, HC and BKV; (iii) re$4ction of investment in new rail due to
the reuse of salvaged Material (used rail); (iv) savings in vehicle operating
costs and travel time ue to reduced congestion and improved road surfaces;
and (v) reduction in maintenance expenses of track, rolling stock and vehicles
due to reduced wear, savings in manpower, in operating expenses and increased
productivity. The quantifiable benefits from the different project components
produce economic returns (ER) ranging from 151 to 302 with an overall ER of
201. This estimate excludes benefits not quantified such as environmental
improvements in Budapest city due to diversion of heavy commercial vehicles
from the city to the Budapest by-pass and enhanced quality of service and
customer satisfaction due to improved management information and marketing
systems.
11.      Risks.  The economic justification of the proposed project components
has been well-established ever, under unfavorable hypotheses concerning project
costs and benefits. The technical solutions adopted are based on adequate
engineering and technical studies. Risks from inadequate project
implementation appear minimal as the physical components of the project are
essentially a complement to the on-going project, on which implementation
performance is excellent. However. there remains the remote possibility of a
change in the present political environment leading to a reversal of che
on-going reform process which could be a potential risk for implementation of
the policy reform measures associated with the project. As the Government is
firmly committed to the ongoing reform, this risk would be minimal and,
therefore, acceptable.
12.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Director approve the proposed loan.
