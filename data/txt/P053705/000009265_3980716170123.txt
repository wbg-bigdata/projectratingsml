Nicaragua - Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objective and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
The overall objective would be to improve the efficiency of road transportation in Nicaragua.
The specific objectives of the project are to (i) support Nicaragua's ongoing road rehabilitation
program, especially the improvement of the main road link to the Atlantic region; (ii) improve
the management and implementation of road maintenance; and (iii) continue to strengthen
planning and programming in the MCT.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex 1):
CAS document number: 17496     Date of latest CAS discussion: April 9, 1998
The project supports CAS objectives related to improving the country's basic infrastructure, as
an essential component of its broader private sector development strategy and efforts to improve
its competitiveness. The priority of such improvements was underscored also in the 1998 Public
Investment Review (16748-NI), which makes specific mention of the Managua - El Rama road
to the Atlantic Region that will be rehabilitated under the project.
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Extensive road rehabilitation needs: Road transport is the sole mode of transportation available
for most freight and passenger movements in Nicaragua. However, given its size, Nicaragua has
a small road network (17,146 km), only 13% of which is in good condition. The mostly poor
condition of the road network resulted from the earlier years of conflict, fiscal crises, insufficient
resources, and the lack of adequate attention to road maintenance. Hence, the network is now
largely unable to support the economic recovery in an efficient way. This is particularly true
for most of Nicaragua's exports, bound nowadays primarily for Atlantic destinations, as
extensive segments of the sole road from Managua to El Rama are virtually intransitable. Partly
as a result of this, Nicaraguan shippers have to use the more costly alternative transit routes
through Honduran and Costa Rican ports. In response to this situation, the Government has
requested assistance from IDA, Danida and the IDB to help rehabilitate the Managua - El Rama
road. Doing so would address one of the highest priority needs of the transport sector and
support the ongoing economic recovery.
Inadequate road maintenance: As roads are improved, it is essential that they not be allowed to
deteriorate as in the past. Maintenance plays a key role in minimizing deterioration, but it is not
being carried out adequately. Several factors cause this. Key among them are the lack of
adequate budgetary allocations, the untimely releases of funds, and the institutional and other
limitations in the MCT that hamper the planning and implementation of maintenance. Several
initiatives are underway to help address these issues. For example, in terms of the funding of
maintenance, the MCT drafted and presented a Road Fund Law to the Economic Cabinet in
December 1997. Passage of the law and establishment of the Road Maintenance Fund (RMF)
will help to ensure sustainable funding for road maintenance. Using the Bank's Road User
Charges model, it was determined that an initial 10 cent per gallon surcharge would suffice.
Given IDA experiences with the time and difficulty involved in creating an effective road fund,



Project Appraisal Document                                                Page 3
Nicaragua - Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance F'roject
substantial technical assistance will be included under the project to help MCT to develop public
support, and to design the implementing arTangements, including staff training, for the Fund. In
terms of implementation, the MCT intends to contract out more of the maintenance works and
to employ the parastatals (CERC) only in locations where, or times when, there are no viable
alternatives.  However, there is still a need to develop  the MCT's capacity to manage
maintenance by contract as well as to strengthen the local construction industry. This includes
developing MCT's capacity to carry out condition inventories of the roads, design and
implement annual and multi-annual routine and periodic maintenance programs, as well as to
seek least cost solutions to technical and engineering problems associated with road and bridge
maintenance. MCT will require a long-term program of technical assistance to help accomplish
all these goals; this need is being partially met under the ongoing Cr.2871-NI, and the proposed
project will deepen and extend such support. The mid-term review of the project will be focused
on the effectiveness and sustainability of the maintenance program as a whole and, if necessary,
on fine tuning the technical assistance arrangements.
Weaknesses in planning and programmi.ng:  Planning is undertaken largely in relation to
preparing annual investments for inclusion in the national budget. Although most projects pass
minimum economic rates of return hurdles, at times the annual road improvement plans may not
be prioritized appropriately and also not include adequate provisions for maintenance. To
remedy this situation, the MCT intends to develop further its capacity to plan and rank
investments in terms of their economic priority and the Government's strategic goals, while
paying adequate attention to their environmental and social aspects.   This will require
strengthening of the planning division, the training of staff in the use of the HDM and other
planning models, and the development of true annual and multi-annual road improvement
programs. Some of the groundwork is already underway as the MCT, with Danida assistance, is
developing the initial phases of a pavement management system. This assistance involves
primarily analyzing and determining roughness indices and the condition of paved roads, as well
as the provision of training for MCT staff. Later stages will require establishing this capability
in a sustainable way in the MCT as well as expanding it further to enable MCT to prepare
economically prioritized investment programs and to develop budgeting models that can
optimize the tradeoffs between expenditures for rehabilitation and maintenance. MCT would
thus be in a position to promote balanced road improvement plans that have sound economic
underpinnings, and also to articulate the rationale for its choices.
3. Sector Issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Rehabilitation and Maintenance Backlog: The project's components were selected for their
economic importance and for their potential contribution to improving the physical integration
of the country. The links selected form part of the highest ranked corridor (in terms of ERR and
NPV) for road improvement projects in Nicaragua. The proposed IDA funding will help finance
the rehabilitation of about 120 km of the corridor between Managua (Portezuelo) and El Rama.
This represents the IDA share of a parallel effort with Danida and the IDB to rehabilitate the
290 km corridor. The project will also include support for the implementation of maintenance
by contract, including routine maintenance works by microenterprises, and a road stabilization/
periodic maintenance program that should help keep the roads passable in the near term.

Institutional Development and Training: The proposed project would provide support for
improving the planning, funding, and implementation of road maintenance and rehabilitation
programs as well as the appropriate training of MCT staff.

2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
These include:
i) ensuring that appropriate attention is paid to road maintenance through the provision of



Project Appraisal Document                                                    Page 5
Nicaragua - Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
adequate budgetary allocations, the establishment of a Road Maintenance Fund, and also by
expanding the program of road maintenance by contract;
ii) improving the selection, planning and prioritization of road rehabilitation projects and better
coordination with Donors; and
iii) strengthening of planning and programming in the MCT.
3. Benefits and target population:
The proposed project will benefit road users and the economy as a whole in terms of lower
vehicle operating costs and, especially in the case of Atlantic destinations, significantly reduced
travel times. Improvement of the road can help to encourage better communications and the
integration of the Atlantic region with the more developed Pacific side of the country. Although
not included in the quantified benefit stream, it has been estimated that the improved roads could
induce a diversion of some of the cargo traffic now transshipped through Honduras to the less
costly alternative route through El Rama, thus representing significant savings to Nicaraguan
shippers (details are in the Project File). This would result also in a better utilization of both
the port facilities and the improved (Danida-financed dredging) river channel as cargo would be
shifted away from the highly utilized facilities at Puerto Cortes and to the now under-utilized
facilities at Rama. Finally, the technical assistance should lead to improved management, and
the least-cost design and implementation of road rehabilitation and maintenance projects. This
is quite significant as it represents potentially a more efficient use of about 10% of overall
public expenditures.
4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
The MCT, through the Technical Support Team (TST) that is already managing the current IDA
project (Cr.2871-NI), will manage the proposed project. The ongoing operation was the first
IDA project in the road sub-sector; after some initial delays related largely to the change of
Government in 1997, the TST staff have learned rapidly and the ongoing project is being
managed well. For the proposed project, MCT will provide at least 2 additional local engineers
to strengthen the TST, which will be supported also by foreign consultants specialized in the
design and implementation of road maintenance by contract, and in soils and asphaltic cement
stabilization techniques. The TST is to be maintained for the duration of the project and it will
continue to report to the existing Project Coordination Unit (PCU) in the MCT. Also, given the
new IDA financial management requireiments, MCT performance in terms of accounting,
internal control procedures, and financial management capabilities, was reviewed in detail
during project preparation. The overall performance is acceptable, but there are certain areas
that need improvement. An action plan was agreed with MCT for ensuring the use of an
accounting system with an appropriate chart of accounts to classify project expenditures. Most
important now is for MCT to purchase the computer and software required and render the
system operational; this was agreed at negotiations to be a condition of credit effectiveness.
MCT will then be in a position to implement the chart of accounts and recording system
designed by the IDA mission. Finally, acdequate arrangements already exist under Cr.2871-NI
for the auditing of project accounts and financial statements by a private firm whose contract
will be expanded to cater for the proposed project.

Nicaragua - Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
a) Develop alternative links to the Atlantic: The other options, such as a road to Bluefields
Bay, are too costly and technically and environmentally difficult. This corridor represents the
shortest and most trafficked link, even though the journey (100 km) from El Rama to the
Atlantic coast has to be completed by boat in the Escondido river.
b) Larger maintenance implementation component: This is appealing as there are high economic
rates of return associated with road maintenance projects. However, given that only 13% of the
network is in good condition, it was decided to have a smaller maintenance implementation
component coupled with comprehensive arrangements to develop the management capability of
MCT to oversee effectively the increasing share of maintainable roads that will result from the
completion of the various rehabilitation projects.
2. Major related projects financed by the IDA and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
Apart from startup difficulties, the main lessons learned from the ongoing, and similar
operations in other countries, and that have been applied in this project were that: (i) planning
and programming procedures, especially for road maintenance need to be given increased
emphasis; (ii) frequent supervision is needed due to the limited experience of Government
agencies; (iii) sustainable institutional improvements require significant efforts from the
Government and support from donors over a long period of time; (iv) unless dealt with
continuously, the inconsistent and inadequate provision of counterpart funds could reduce
project implementation rates well below existing MCT implementation capacity; and (v)
frequent changes in administration and key staff can adversely affect the implementation of TA
and institutional strengthening programs.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
There has long been interest in Nicaragua in a project that could improve transportation in the
corridor between Managua and El Rama, and this was emphasized by the current Government in
its CSIR and CAS brainstorming sessions with Bank staff and also during the discussusions on
the draft Public Investment Review (16478-NI). The Government is committed to providing

Nicaragua - Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
some of the personnel and other resources needed to implement the project. In order to ensure a
regular and adequate flow of funds, the Government will establish a local counterpart funds
account (Fondo Rotatorio) that should he]Lp in adhering to the project implementation schedule;
this was agreed at negotiations to be a condition of credit effectiveness. The Government is also
committed to strengthening its capacity to plan and program efficiently and to implement more
road maintenance by contract.
5. Value added of IDA support in this project:
Nicaragua is still in the initial stages of addressing its road transport sector needs, which are vast
given the long period of civil strife and the associated neglect of the road network. There now
exists a strong desire on the part of the Government to restore the entire road network, and in
this context IDA support could be important in the design of a balanced road improvement
program that focuses on the sustainable development of the institutions that manage the sector
as well as on the maintenance needs of the road network. Hence, apart from financing needed
investments in road rehabilitation, the rationale for IDA involvement includes: (i) helping to
improve the planning, funding and implementation of road maintenance; (ii) ensuring that
adequate attention is paid to policy and environmental issues in the sector; and (iii) helping to
strengthen the MCT so that it can better respond to the needs of the sector. IDA's experience
with the establishment of road maintenance funds, and with contracting routine maintenance to
microenterprises is also extremely important at this juncture.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
[x] Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV=US$14.8 million; ERR= 23.5%
The economic justification was based prirnarily on the quantifiable benefits that can be attributed
to the road rehabilitation. The investment costs exclude all taxes and duties but, given the
degree of trade openness of the economy, no shadow prices or exchange rate adjustments were
used. The detailed derivation of costs and benefit streams is included in the feasibility study and
a comprehensive extract of the salient features of the economic justification and the sensitivity
analysis is presented in Annex 4. Adequate periodic and routine maintenance expenditures were
included in the ERR and NPV determinations.
2. Fiscal impact:
The net fiscal impact will be very small. The project's annual investment needs represent <0.5%
of Government expenditures. Also the annual revenues collected from the transport sector
(license fees, fuel taxes, duties on vehicles and spares, etc.) are well in excess of annual road
maintenance needs.
3. Technical:
The proposed works include the rehabilitation of the existing road, while largely maintaining the
physical characteristics in terns of the cross-section and alignment. Additional shoulder width
will be provided in built-up locations to help promote the safety of pedestrians and non-
motorized traffic.

Nicaragua - Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
b. Project management: The project will be managed by virtually the same TST that is currently
responsible for the implementation of Cr. 2871-NI. This should be a good fit since the
implementation of this project will peak in the years when Cr. 2871-NI is expected to wind
down. The only changes being proposed would be the addition of 2 more local engineers, the
hiring of a specialist in soils and asphaltic cement stabilization techniques, and the replacement
of the expatriate general adviser's position by a specialist in road maintenance by contract. The
Government agreed at negotiations to maintain the TST for the duration of the project.
5. Environmental assessment:   Environmental Category    []A   [x] B  []C
The proposed project includes minimum rehabilitation and maintenance works along existing
roads. There will be no new road construction or resettlement of people. However, as a
condition of disbursement, MCT will have to submit an acceptable environmental assessment for
the Portezuelo -Managua Airport link that was added to the project at negotiations. In the
Atlantic region, there are some potential social impacts of the project, including possible
pressure from colonists, miners and loggers on lands occupied traditionally and claimed by
indigenous communities but which have not been legally recognized or demarcated. Hence, for
the rehabilitation of the Rama section, the effectiveness of the Atlantic Biological Corridor
project would be a condition of disbursement, as the needed mitigatory measures for potential
longer term social and environmental impacts are included under that project. The project also
includes a feasibility study of the design and implementation of a forest restoration program in
the corridor near El Rama that connects the Cerro Wawasan and Cerro Silva protected areas.
Finally, assistance would be provided to help ensure that the environmental unit in the MCT
becomes integrated more fully into the planning and preparation of road improvement projects.
6. Participatory approach:
a. Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups:
The groups involved are road users, freight forwarders, farmers and property owners. While
they have long publicly expressed a strong desire for the road improvements envisioned under
this project, a formnal participatory approach was not used. This is because no new construction
is planned and the project will benefit the stakeholders without any tangible negative outcomes.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
Project sustainability will be enhanced through strengthening of the MCT and the emphasis
placed on cost-effective use of the scarce resources available for road transport improvements.
Implementation of the project will help enhance the probability of the continued selection and
effective implementation of the projects that represent a high priority for Nicaragua at this stage
of its development. The project will endow the MCT with trained staff, and the techniques and
know-how to better manage the development of the sector. Also the establishment of the Road
Maintenance Fund, together with the proposed improvements in maintenance planning and
implementation, will help provide the prerequisites needed by MCT for the continued use of
microenterprises and other contractual arrangements for road maintenance in an efficient

manner. Taken together, over time, these will arrangements will contribute to the proper
allocation of resources between the highest priority maintenance and rehabilitation works, and to
the use of the appropriate, least-cost approaches and technologies for implementing them.

Nicaragua - Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
Annex 2
Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
Project Description
IDA-financed Components
Project Component A - Road Rehabilitation (US$26.7 million)
I.    This component will finance the rehabilitation and improvement of approximately 120 km of the
Managua - El Rama road. The works will be carried out in two distinct sections, namely the Managua section,
from Portezuelo (km 5) to San Benito (km 34.3), and the Rama section, from Muhan (km 202.3) to El Rama (km
292.5). The intermediate sections between San Benito and Muhan, totaling about 170 km, will be rehabilitated
under separate projects that are being prepared and will be financed by Danida and the IDB.
2.    The road was paved in the 1970s to mostly two lane rural road standards but has deteriorated severely
over the years, until Danida financed some stabilization works in 1995/6. Although the entire road needs
rehabilitation, the Rama section of the road is now in worse condition than the Managua section. Overall, the
existing road has an adequate cross- section, a wide right-of-way and is in gently sloping terrain with the
maximum elevation (about 500 meters) occurring at Santo Tomas, a town located at about 170 km from
Managua.
3.    The proposed works consist primarily of rehabilitating the road along the existing alignment, widening
the shoulders (especially in locations with roadside vendors and bicyclists), provision of adequate drainage and
road signs. Road recycling technologies seem to be the best approach for rehabilitating this road. Consultancy
services will be provided to MCT to help supervise these works. A description of the salient features of each
IDA-financed section follows:
Al: Portezuelo -La Garita - San Benito (US$9.6 million, 29.3 km): This road section is heavily trafficked and is
part of the Pan American Highway. The first 10 km section from Portezuelo - La Garita consists of a 4-lane dual
carriageway and has traffic volumes of more than 10,000 vehicles per day (vpd). It is also used by many
bicyclists who commute to and from Managua. La Garita - San Benito consists of a single 2 lane road with
traffic volumes decreasing to about 2000 vpd near San Benito. The road has adequate width and can be
rehabilitated within the existing right of way. As part of the rehabilitation, bus pullover areas will be provided
and the road shoulders will be widened to help improve safety for cyclists and other slow moving traffic.
A2: San Benito - Santa Rosa (Danida-financed link) and A3: Santa Rosa - Muhan (IDB-financed link) are
described in the feasibility study included in the Project File.
A4: Muhan- La Gateada (US$4.1 million, 20.0 km): Some of the worst sections of the road are located here but it
has adequate formation width. Part of the road (about 500 m) will have to be rebuilt completely or rerouted due
to a major landslide. It carries about 580 vpd.
A5: La Gateada - Esperanza (US$11.0 million, 61.3 km): The roadway here is also severely deteriorated. In
terms of motorized vehicles, this is also the least traveled section of the road with about 400 vpd, comprising
mainly freight traffic. At sections where there are many vendors! slow moving vehicles/ cyclists, wider shoulders
and vehicle pull-offs will be provided. Where appropriate, bikepaths will be separated from the rest of the road
shoulder.

Nicaragua - Second Road Rehabiltation and Maintenance Project
A6: Esperanza - El Rama (US2.0 million, 8.9 km): The pavement is severely distressed and has large potholes.
Again wider shoulders will be provided here as there are an increasing number of merchants and bicycles. The
traffic here is about 500 vpd.
Project Component B - Road Maintenance (US$10.8 million)
4.    This component includes provisions for the implementation of both routine and periodic maintenance by
contract. It represents specific IDA assistance to MCT in meeting its overall maintenance targets (see table A)
for which additional technical assistance will be provided. The sub- components are:
BI: Road Stabilization/ periodic maintenance: About US$3.7 million for a road stabilization component. The
latter will consist of contracts for private contractors for the implementation of spot improvements and major
maintenance works required to keep the Rama road and other trunk roads passable all year.
B2: Routine Maintenance by Microenterprises: About US$4.6 million for an extension of the program for
routine maintenance by microenterprises, started under Cr.2871-NI.  IDA will mostly finance training,
promotional activities, training materials, goods, equipment and the technical assistance required. An additional
12 microenterprises will be formed and some 1100 km of roads will be maintained (under both projects).
Assistance will be provided also for the routine maintenance by community organizations of rural roads in the
departments of Chinandega, Nueva Segovia, Madriz, and Esteli that have been affected adversely by the El Ninio-
related droughts.   The goal is to both generate emergency, productive short-term  employment in these
departments and to provide improved road access for small farmers.
B3: RMF Works: Pending enactment of the Road Maintenance Fund law, about US$2.5 million would be
available for spot improvements/ periodic maintenance on roads to be selected from the MCT maintenance
program and approved by IDA. These works are to be implemented by private contractors to be hired by the
MCT.
5.    Consultancy services will be provided to MCT to assist in the design and management of this program.
Project Component C - Consultants services, TA, Training, Studies (US$7.6million )
6.    This component includes technical assistance, training, and studies needed to help MCT implement the
project and to manage the road sector development better. The subcomponents are:
Cl: Technical Support Team (US$1.0 million): Support will be continued for the TST that is currently
managing the implementation of Cr.2871-NI, and that will subsequently manage the proposed project, though the
expatriate adviser position will not be continued as the local project management staff are now sufficiently
experienced and capable. IDA support will be used primarily for performance monitoring, design and
implementation of training programs, technical audits, traffic origin-destination surveys, preparation of reports,
organizing the Annual Transport Sector review, the purchase of 3 utility vehicles, and ICR preparation. MCT
will be asked to strengthen the TST by providing 2 additional local engineers.
C2: TA for the design and supervision of the overall contract maintenance program, including staff training,
and for the establishment of the Road Maintenance Fund (US$1.8 million). Comprehensive assistance will be
provided to help MCT fulfill its maintenance objectives as outlined in Table A of this Annex, including the
design of promotional activities and the training of staff for the institutional and operational needs of the RMF.
An expatriate senior engineer, experienced in soils and asphaltic cement stabilization will be hired. Also, the
current expatriate adviser position in the TST will be converted into that of a specialist in the design and

implementation of road maintenance by contract.
C3: TA, training and equipment for improving planning and programming in the MCT (US$0.4 million): This
is intended to help MCT prepare rolling 3-year investment plans using the Bank's HDM and other analytical
planning models. The objective is to enable MCT to plan and prioritize investments in a manner that would
utilize scarce resources efficiently. Adequate attention will also be paid to integrating sound environmental
practices in the planning cycle and the MCT environmental manual will be updated to reflect recent experiences
in the sector and to provide appropriate guidelines for planners.
C4: Training and equipment for the installation of the Pavement Management System (US$0.4 million). This
system will help MCT to monitor and analyse the condition of the road network and to systematically update the
road network inventory. The PMS will also provide some of the basic information needed for the planning of
both road maintenance and road rehabilitation. Project support will be complementary to Danida assistance in
this area.
C5: Consultancy services for feasibility studies, preparation and updating of detailed engineering, and for the
supervision of components A and B of the project (US$3.6 million).
C6: Studies for (a) Road Safety improvement (US$0.3 million) and (b) Reforestation near the Rama section
(US$0.1 million). The first study will focus on identifying and analyzing accident blackspots and subsequently
designing a strategy to improve road safety. The latter study will analyze the feasibility of the design and
implementation of a forest restoration program in the road corridor near Rama that connects the Cerro Wawasan
and the Cerro Silva protected areas. These areas are identified in the maps in the project document for the
Atlantic Biological Conservation Project (GEF financed).

Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
Cost Benefit Analysis Summary
Background
1.    The road links to be improved, from Portezuelo - San Benito, and Muhan- El Rama, are located on
Nicaragua's Pacific (Managua section) and Atlantic sides (Rama section) respectively. They constitute the only
east- west trunk road in Nicaragua and link the most densely populated Department (Managua) with some of the
relatively isolated areas of the country in the RAAS. Overall, the Departments traversed by the road, Managua,
Boaco, Chontales, and RAAS together contain about 40% of the total population of Nicaragua. Agriculture,
particularly cattle ranching, is the predominant economic activity along the road corridor. However, other than in
Managua, the population along the road corridor is predominantly poor. According to the Bank's poverty report
(No. 14038-NI of June 1995), the RAAS is one of the poorest departments in Nicaragua.
2.    The road was constructed between 1962 -74 and connects Managua to the country's main Atlantic port
(Arlen Siu). This route is becoming of interest to international shippers as it represents a less costly alternative to
the current transshipping of Nicaraguan freight through Honduran and Costa Rican ports. In theory, the Rama
section of the road traverses the western part of the Atlantic Biological Corridor; however the areas adjacent to
the road have been farmed for a long time and are no longer forested.
Traffic
3.    The traffic volumes in the corridor were estimated on the basis of counts carried out by the MCT and
updated by the systematic 7-day counts carried out in 1996 and 1997 by consultants who were completing the
feasibility studies. The traffic volumes vary significantly by road section and location, with volumes ranging
between 2,000 - 10,000 vpd on the Managua section and 480 -580 vpd along the Rama section. Buses and
trucks typically account for about 45% of the vehicles in the corridor. However, agricultural and other slow
moving vehicles, which significantly retard the flow of traffic, account for 15 - 20% of the traffic. For traffic
overall, annual growth now ranges between 6-7% along most sections of the road. Since most trips are work or
business related, the traffic growth rates can be expected to increase as the economic recovery continues and more
road sections are improved. However, they have been maintained conservatively at 6-7% p.a for this analysis.
Benefits and Beneficiaries
4.    Implementation of the project will help provide benefits to the road users, the MCT and the economy as
a whole given that this road constitutes really the sole functional east-west land connection. The benefits from
the road improvements can be quantified as they consist largely of savings in vehicle operating costs (voc) and in
travel time. The voc were derived from recent MCT information on operating costs for vehicles in Nicaragua and
on the road deterioration profiles derived from the HDM3 model. Due to the extremely poor condition of some
sections of the road now, the proposed rehabilitation will typically produce a 30 - 40% reduction in operating
costs, depending on vehicle type. Time savings will also be significant as the improved roads will facilitate
average operating speeds well in excess of the current 25 kph.
5.    Non-quantifiable benefits will include the improvements in overall planning and programming
procedures, especially for maintenance. This will help foster a more efficient use of resources and also help
protect national investments in current and past road improvements. Also, there will be significant road safety

Nicaragua - Second Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Project
benefits due to the provision of wider shoulders to allow easier access for motorists in locations with high
roadside vending activity and also to separate bicycle traffic.
6.     Though not included in the benefit stream, it has been estimated that the improved roads could induce a
40% diversion of cargo traffic now transshipped through Honduras to the less costly alternative route through
Rama, thus representing significant savings to Nicaraguan shippers. This could result in a better utilization of
port facilities and the improved (Danida-financed dredging) river channel as about 70,000 tons of cargo could be
shifted away from the highly utilized facilities at Puerto Cortes and to the now under-utilized facilities at Rama.
Economic Returns
7.    The economic justification was based primarily on the quantifiable benefits that can be attributed to the
road rehabilitation. The investment costs exclude all taxes and duties but, giveli the degree of trade openness of
the economy, no shadow prices or exchange rate adjustments were used. The detailed derivation of costs and
benefit streams is included in the feasibility study but a comprehensive extract of the salient features of the
economic justification and the sensitivity analysis is presented in Table A. Adequate periodic and routine
maintenance expenditures were included in the ERR and NPV determinations. As the following summary table
shows, the overall ERR is 23.5%.

Risks
8.    The main risks relate to the unreliability of counterpart funds, and to the MCT's limited capacity to
design and implement an adequate program of maintenance by contract. These will be addressed through
agreements with the Government on the timely provision of counterpart funds in the Fondo Rotatorio that will be
setup for the project. The success of contract maintenance depends on the capabilities of both the MCT and the
private contractors. MCT will be required to hire the supervisory personnel needed to help design and implement
this component. It is expected also that the establishment and use of the Road Maintenance Fund will help to
eliminate some of the problems associated with untimely payments to contractors in the past. In this sense the
TA to be provided under the project will help to alleviate some of the risks.
Distributional Impacts
9.    The principal beneficiaries of the road improvements will include the predominantly poor agricultural
communities along the road. Most studies indicate that the income levels of these communities are typically well
below national averages. Due to the road rehabilitation, the country as a whole will benefit from the reduced
vehicle operating costs and consumption of imported fuel and spare parts. The reduced transportation costs will
also help to make Nicaragua's exports more competitive, especially for low profit margin crops such as coffee
and bananas and will benefit both the urban and rural areas.

Fiscal Impacts.
10.    These will be overwhelmingly positive. The project's annual investment needs are small and represent
very small shares of both Government expenditures (< 0.5%) and of revenues from the license fees, fuel taxes,
duties on vehicles and spares etc. recovered from the transport sector (<1.0%). Similarly, the future maintenance
needs will not represent a fiscal burden. This is because the revenues (about US$70 million) from the road
transport sector are already well in excess of the annual road maintenance requirements (US$12 million).

Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, dated January 1995 (and revised January and August
1996, and September 1997). Procurement of consultant services will follow the "Guidelines for the
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers", dated January 1997 and revised
September 1997. Standard bidding Documents (SBD) will be used for all Bank financed procurement.
International competitive bidding (ICB) will be used for works contracts of US$1.5 million or
more under the Managua-Rama road rehabilitation component. For contracts below US$1.5 million
covering road maintenance national competitive bidding will be used, up to an aggregate of US$7.6
million. Routine road maintenance works estimated to cost less than US$100,000 per contract up to an
aggregate amount of US$4.5 million may be done through direct contracting with community
organizations and microenterprises following special procedures outlined in paragraph 3.7 of the
Guidelines and on the basis of reference unit prices and standardized quantities. This procurement
modality is a continuation of the one in place under the First Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance
Project (Cr.2871-NI) which allows for the (i) participation of local communities in the direct
implementation of small works; (ii) formation of maintenance microenterprises; and (iii) development
of local contractors. Goods, equipment and materials under the project with a cost per contract of
US150,000 or more will be procured using ICB; individual contracts costing between US$25,000 and
US$150,000 will be procured under NCB rules, up to an aggregate of US$200,000; and for individual
contracts below US$25,000 national and international shopping procedures based on three quotations
will be used, up to an aggregate of US$500,000.
Consultants' services will be procured under contracts awarded under QCBS and other selection
methods indicated in table Al.
Retroactive financing for all components of the project, not to exceed SDR 380,000
(US$500,000 equivalent) would be provided for expenditures incurred between April 1, 1998 and the
date of the Credit Agreement. This is considered necessary for MCT to adhere to the project's
implementation schedule.

Disbursements
Allocation of loan proceeds: (see Table C). The credit should be disbursed completely by June
30, 2003.
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs): Disbursements under the project will be made against full
documentation of expenditure except for the following items, for which disbursements would be on the
basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOEs): (i) maintenance works contracts estimated to cost less than
US$100,000 equivalent, except for the first two contracts; (ii) goods, including construction materials,
training materials, office equipment, and supplies, estimated to cost less than US$150,000, except for the
first two contracts; (iii) consultants contracts, estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent for firms
and individuals; and (iv) all training. The expenditures to be disbursed in respect of the, microenterprise,
community organization, and RMF part of the training will include the costs of fuel, oil, and spares for
vehicles, and also other costs incurred by MCT in establishing and supporting them. Similarly, the
promoters' fees, per diem, training facilities rentals and the printing of training materials will also be
eligible expenditures for reimbursement on the basis of SOEs. SOE records would be made available to
IDA staff as required for inspection during supervision.
Special account:   A special account with an authorized allocation of up to US$4.0 million,
corresponding to about 4 months of expenditures will be opened in the Central Bank or a commercial
Bank acceptable to IDA. The initial deposit will be US$1.0 million equivalent. This account will be
maintained by MCT. The Special Account would be used for all eligible foreign and local expenditures.
Replenishments to the Special Account would be made on a monthly basis or when 20 percent of the
initial deposit has been used, whichever occurs first.
