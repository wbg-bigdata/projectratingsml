APPRAISAL OF
THE IL'DTAN IRON AND STEEL COMN?AIY' LIMITED
COAL MINING PRO3ECT
(India)
SUfliARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Indian Iron and Steel Company, Limited (IISCO) is at present
the second largest steel producer in India, with a present annual capacity
of 80O,OOO tons of finished steel products. The company has a long tradi-
tion of sound management and its properties, which are conservatively valued,
form a fully integrated steel works. Presently, about 85% of the company's
iron ore and 15% of its coal requirements come from properties owned and
operated by the company. Based on the company's estimated coal require-
ments of about 2.1 million tons by 1965, the proposed project will make the
company self-sufficient in coal (Paras. 1-12).
In December 1952, and December 1956, the Bank made loans
(71-IN and 159-IN) for 031.5 million and $200 million respectively to
the Indian Iron and Steel Company, Limited (IISCO) to meet the foreign
exchange costs of two major expansion programs.  These expansion programs,
the so-called 1953 and 1955 Extensions, which are now completed, were aimed
at increasing the companyts annual capacity for the production of saleable
steel from 350,000 tons to 800,000 tons (Paras. 13-25).
i1ii      One of the factors that has prompted the company to undertake
the present coal p-oject is the steady deterioration in the quality of
purchased coal during the past six years. Between December 1955 and
Decermoer i960 the average ash content has increased from 16.17'/ to 17.61%
and the maximum ash content has increased from 18.30,' to 21.20%..  The
increase in the ash content of the coking coal has resulted in an increase
in coke and limestone consumption and a decrease in pig iron production
which has, in part, prevented the company from reaching its full capacity
(Paras. 26-27).
iv.       Another factor in the corpany's decision to undertake this
project is that the rail deliveries of coal have sometimes been trouble-
some. To assure itself of a steady supply of good quality coking coal,
therefore, the company has decided to exploit the large coal reserves at
its Chasnalla property, to improve and expand coal production at its
Jitpur and Rannagore collieries; and to install a ropeway systerm from
Jitpur to Chasnalla and from Chasnalla to Burnpur to enable it to meet
the bu2k of its coal requirements without having to rely on the railroads
(Para. 28).
v.        At its Chasnalla properties the company plans to sink two double
shafts to a depth of 1,200 ft. for underground mining mad to open up one
opercast mine. Chasnalla production would reach the planned output of
4,700 tons per day (1.41 million tons per year) during the seventh year
cf the cornstruction period.  The production at Jitmir would be increased
to 1,500 tons Der dEay (450,000 tons per year) fror its present capacity



- ii -
of 700 ton3 par lay. The expansion would le completed dur ing the sixth
year.  At iamnagore A the company is sinking a new shaft to a deptn of
8C0 ft. which irill increase production of the existing mine.  Prcducticn
is expected to reach 1,000 tons per day (300,000 tons per year) within
thiee years. The company also plans to improve ventilation and gathering
and transportation of sand for stowing (Paras, 29-35).
vi.       in order to maintain a steady flow of coal from the collieries
to the steel-making facilities at Thctrnpur, the company plans to install
a 6-mile long feeder ropeway from Jitpur to Chasnalla and a 32-mile long
ropeway froni Chasnalla to Burnpur (See NJ;ap No.3). Coal produced at
R.amnagore A will continue to be transported to Burnpur on a railroad
onmed by the company. The entire ropeway system is expected to be com-
pleted in four years (Paras. 39-41).
vii.      It is estimated that it would take eight years to complete the
dRsvelopment of the coal properties. Coal production is expected to reach
the planned maximum of 2,16 million tons per year in the seventh year after
cunstruction begins (Para. 56).
viii,     The cost of the proposed coal mining and ropeway projects is
astimated at US,4/O.2 million equivalent of which US$l9.5 millior i.s in
fore!gn exchange.  The project cost estimates include freight and insur-
ance, and interest during construction, but do not include the cost of
land, housing, and certain taxes. The plans for the project are tech-
n-ically sound and cost estimates and contingency and other allowances
app3ar to be adequate (Paras. 61-62).
ix.       The company's total financial requirements during the seven-year
construction period ending M4arch 31, 1967 are estimated at U31.140.3 mill on
ec1uivalent.  Tt has been assumed that these requirements uould be met, ill
addition to internally generated cash (net income after taxes nlu3 interest
and depre-iaticn charges less estimated dividends on common and preference
3hares) of US4; 108.9 nillion equivalent, by the following sources: a new
B,nk loan of US,19.5 million equivalent; the sale of US%07.4 million equiv-
alent of Ordinary Shares; the sale of U& 7.6 million ecquivalent of invest-
ments; and US.2.5 million from other sources (Paras. 71-72).
-zlo      On the basis of these and other assumptions included in Annex 8,
the financial projections indicate that the company's pre-tax profits
should remain at about the 1961 level during the construction period and
incrcase slowly thereafter as interest charges decline.  Since the effect
of expanded coal production on the company's improved steel operations is
lifficult to predict, the estimates of steel production and average vJorks
cost may prove to be too conservative.  Interest chLrges on the company's
debt are well covered. The coverage of total debt service during the con-
struction period is rather lowi since the company has heavy amortization of



- iii -
tuo outstanding Bank loans. Upon maturity of the presently outstanding
Bank loans and Govern-ment loan in fiscal 1967/68, debt service coverage
improves sharply. The debt equity ratio, forecast at 32:68 prior to
disbursements under the proposed loan improves steadily to 15:85 at the
end of the construction period. The current ratio of the company is poor
and has been deteriorating since 1956 but is expected to improve during
the construction period (Paras. 79-84).
xi.       Protective arrangements provide for restrictions on borrowings,
and a restriction on investments in assets other than those included in
the project (Paras. 85-90).
xii.      IISCO's coal mining and ropeway project is sound and would
nrovide the company with a steady supply of coking coal of satisfactory
quality.  The project w-rould be a suitable basis for a Bank loan of
US$19.5 million equivalent for a term of 12 years including a five-year
grace period. The Government of India has agreed to guarantee the loan
(Para. 91).



I. ITTRODUCTION
1.        Cn December 18, 1952, and December 19, 1956, the Bank made loarns
(71-IN and 159-IN) for $31.5 million and $'20cO million respectively to the
Tndian Iron and Steel Company Limited (IISCO) to meet the foreign exchange
cost.s of two major expansion programs. These exparnsion programs, the so-
called 1953 ard 1955 Extensions, which are now completed, Tjere aimied at in-
creasing the company's annual capacity for the production of saleable ste3l
from 350,000 tons to 800,000 tons. The company has an integrated iron and
steel plant at Burnpur and an iron foundry at Kulti.  Its instplled annual
production capacity at Burnpur amounts to 1.3 million tons of pig ircn and
L.0 million tons of steel ingots. Part of the pig iron Lot converted ilnto
Lteel is used at the Kulti foundry, and the balance is sold in the local
market.
2.        The IISCO blast furnaces were designed to use coke produced from
coal having a 16% ash content. However, with the rapid expansion of thc
Indian steel industry and the delays in the construction of the Government
Goal washeries, the ash content of the coking coal available to IISCO has
inzreased substantially.  Consequently IISCO has not been able to utilize
the full capacity of its facilities. Present coal requirements amount to
1.8 mi2lion tons of raw coking coal per year and will increase to 2.1
rillion tons by 1965.
The necessity to transport unwashed coal added to the rail car
shDrtage and the congestion of the railways.  Therefore, IISCO decided
to develop coal properties which it had owned for some time and to i.nstall
e ropei-ay to transport coal to the steel works (See Maps 1, 2 and 3)Q
4.        IISCO, in 1960, requested the Bank to finance the project,
iurther discussions resulted in some modifications of the project before
a Zield appraioal was made in early 1961.
r. nThis report is based on information supplied by the company, the
xesults of the Bank's field investigat'on5 and the reports of consultants
ietained by the Bank to study the coal rssoives and Dining plans,,
IIc THE CONIPA'Y
General
6e        The present Indian Iron and Steel Company, Limited (IICCO) came
in&o existeice on Decemboer 315 193-,2. as the result of a merger of an older
company, Indian Iron and Stenl Corpeany, and t:he Steel Company of Eengai
(SCOB). The old IISCO owned ard operated two plants: the plant at Kulti,
whi-ch was established in 1874 tand used for the manufacture of foundry iron,
and a plant at Burnpur, whichi alas constructed in 1919, also to produce
fo-mndry iron, SCOB, organized in 1937 by the managing agents of II300,
owned end operated a steel plant at Burnpur, which began production in
1939, using hot metal from IISCO. The S0CB plant was physically integrated
-Uth the IISCO planit at Burnpur, so that a merger was logical,

7.        The company had a share capital at 1March 31, 1961, of Rs.124,408,990
(0'26.1 million equivalent) in ordinary shares (par value Rs.10) and
Rs,26,995,400 ($5,7 million equivalent) in 5% cumulative prefererce sheres'
(par value Ps.,00)0 At December 31, 1960, there were more than 145000
holders of ordina4ry shares in 23 di'ferent countries, and more than 5,C00
holders of preference shares in 11 countries. About 75% of the ordinary
shares, with a par value of nearly Rs.95 million, were held by 1,175
inve3tors each of whom oimed shares with a par value of more than Rs.10,000;
and over 60G/ of the preference shares, about Rs.17 million par value, wiere
held by 265 investors each of whom owned shares with a par value of more
than Rs,1OCOO)   The ordinary shares are currently selling at about Rs%25
and based on the present dividend of Rs.1.6 are currently yielding 604%.
Properties
8,,       The Burnpur plant is a fully integrated steel plant with an in-
stalled capacity of one million ingot tons or 800,000 tons of finished
products per year. The major installations include four blast furnaces,
cjke ovens, a duplex melting shop, a blooming mill, a structural anid rail
mill, a continuous billet and sheet bar mill, a medium section mill, a
merchant and rod mill, a hand sheet mill and a galvanizing plant.  The
3urnpur plant is well-designed and has modern facilities.
9.        The Zulti Works is the largest foundry in India and manufactures
both iron and steel castings.  Centrifugally cast iron pipes (spun pipes)
constitute the bulk of its production.
10.       The company's fixed assets are conservativelyr valued.  The present
nct boolh value of the plant is equivalent to about :'140 per annual ingot ton.
Replaoemen"i costs would be substantially higher, probably more than double
that emount.
11.       The company gets about 85%/ of its iron ore from its owvn mines i.n
the (rua and Manoharpur areas, 170 miles from Burnpur, and about 15% of
its coal from its own mines in the innediate vicinity of Burnpur. The
olant is served by both the Southeastern and Eastern Railways.
12.       The company owms the towns of Burnpur and Kulti and provides all
the municipal services. About half of the workers live in these towns, in
quarters constructed by the company.  The remainder live in the nearby
town of Asansol.
":LU53 and 1955 Extensions" and Their Financing
13.       The first Bank loan (71-IN) of $31.5 million was signed in Decembor
1952, but was not made effective until October 29, 1954, because the company
wished to weit until it had reached a satisfactory agreement with the goverlu-
mert on retention prices (Annex 1).  This loan was made to cover the "1953
Extensions". in which the main items were: two additional blast furnaces



- 3 -
(vith a capacity of 1,400 tons/day each or a corbired capacity of 800,000
tons/year); the corresponding coke ovens and related facilities; one turbo-
generator; two 2L0-ton open-hearth fu-rnaces and one 25-ton acid lined
converter to be installed in the steel melting shop.  These facilities
were all to be installed at 3urnpur.  The loan also covered an extension
of the Gua Ore Mines to meet the new requirements and the rebuilding of
the two Kulti blast furnaces. The program was intended to increase the
company's annual capacity for pig iron from 640,000 tons to 1.4 million
tons and for finished steel from 350,000 tons to 700,000 tons.  Subsequently,
the company abandoned the plan to rebuild the Kulti blast furnaces. ENever-
theless, as a result of improvement in the efficiency of the two existing
blast furnaces at 3urnpur, the expansion program provided the company with
an annual pig iron capacity of 1.3 million tons. An amount of '>1X48 mil-
lion of the loan, covering part of the cost of the rebuilding of t-he Kulti
blast furnaces, was cancelled on February 26, 1957.
14.       The actual foreign exchange cost of the "1953 Extensions" amounted
to $29,202,888 compared to the original estimate (adjusted for the deletion
of the Kulti blast furnaces) of 5,v30,020,000,  The undrawn balance of 187,112
was cancelled in January 1961. The actual local currency expeniditures are
estira'ed to amount to about Rs.247,364,000 ($251,946,000 equivalent) compared
to an original estimate of Rs,176,252,000 ($37,012,000 equivalent).
15.       The second Bank loan (159-IN) of $m20.0 million equivalent was
signed on December 19, 1956. It became effective on July 2, 1957 with a
limit on drawings. This limitation was withdrawn on July 2, 1958, when
all the security arrangements were completed. The loan was made to cover
the "1955 Extensions" which included facilities to increase the annual
output of finished products from 700,000 tons to 300,000 tons through the
installation of a merchant and rod mill and the addition of two stands to
the present billet mill and of a third stand to the 34" structural mill.
The prugram also included an additional 20,000 kw turbo-generator.
16.       The latest estimate (as of September 30, 1961) of the foreign
exchange costs of the "1955 Extensions" is $P18.5 million, less than the
original estimate. The Bank has recently approved additions, totaling
approximately  l.:15 million, to the List of Goods.  The latest estimate
of local currency costs is Rs.105,000,000 ($522,050,000 equivalent) com-
pared to an original estimate of Rs.53,500,000 ($11,235,000 equivalent).
17.       Local currency requirements for both programs were financed
fror retai-ned earnings, ordinary share issue, sales of investmcnts, govern.-
men-. advalices (See Annex 8. Note 4), and a reduction of net current assets.
18.       The large local currency over-runs on both loans resulted from
a combination of factors. First, part of the over-runs has been due to
an under-estimate of the local currency cost by the ccmpany's consultant.
Second, there were some modifications to the scope of the project.  Thi.d,
there h2s been a slow but stead-r increase in the price of local labor
anI materials ever since the signing of the first loan in 1952. Fourth,
certain items which had originally been scheduled for purchase with foreign
exchange were proc red locally.



19.       Tih audi-uion to the "11953 and 1955 Ertersions", the conpany has
fina;nced from its o-n furds an "Ancillary Works" program, tha most impor-
tant item in ihich was a new spun pipe foundry at Kulti to increase &anual
iron pipe capacity from 100,000 tons to 165,000 tons.

Its net working capital was reduced from plus Rs.41.8 million in 1956 to
minus R6.82.6 million in 1960. This deterioration was due ir, part to a sub-
3Ten-ial increase in the surcharge (excess of sales price over retenticn
prize) liability to the Iron and Steel Controller from Rs.10.5 million to
Ls.66.2 million.  The proceeds of an advance of Rs.40 million from the

liability to Rs.20.7 million at lViarch 31, 1961 and thereby improve the

conmon practi-e in India.  Its managing agents, h1artin Burn Limited, havn
served in Chat capacity from its beginning, and are now serving under a
new ten-year contract ending August 15, 1970  The management fee is fixed
at 7-,-% of net income before taxes (as calculated according to detailed
provisions in the Nanaging Agency Agreement) subject to certain specified
maxima. The management fee payable during the last five years of the
agreement is subject to future approval of the government. The company
aid the managing agents have a long-standing tradition of financial in-
tegrity and sound business practices.

25.       The company experienced a one day strike in 1959 but has had no
difficulty recently. Labor-management relations, similar to those of othier
Indian companies, are satisfactory.
III. THE PROJECT
General
26.       The project is designed to supply the company with about 1.7 mil-
lion tons of clean coal annually (2.2 million tons of raw coal, see
Tabla II, Page 13).  The present raw coking coal requirements of the company
are 1.8 million tons per year and are expected to increase to 2.1 million
tons in 1965. Included in the project are the following:
a)   Development of the Chasnalla coal property and
modernization and improvement of the Jitpur and
Ramnagore collieries;
b)   Installation and improvement of facilities for
gathering sand and transporting it by ropeway to
mines for stowing;
c)   Installation of a coal washing plant at Chesnella
to wash the Chasnalla and Jitpur output; and
a)   Installation of ropeways to transport coal from
Jitpur and Chasnalla to Burnpur.
Coal from Ramnagore would be transported to Burnpur, a distance of about
eight miles, over the existing railroad which is owned by the company.



- 7 -
27.       The company was prompted to urdertake the pcoject by the steady
deterioration in the quality of purchased coal which has affected the
qdanaity and quality of its iron and steel output.  BetWeen December '955
and December 1960, the ash content of coal received by the company has
increased from an average of 16.17% and a mai:imum and minimum of 1830%
and 13.80% respectively to an average of 17.61% and a maximum and minimum
of 21.20% and 14z00% respectively.  In some months in 1960, average ash
content was as high as 20%. Studies made by TAT; and IISC06/ indicate
that with the type of iron ore available each 1% increase in the ash
content of coking coal above 16% is associated with a 3% to 6%o decrease
in pig iron production, a 4% to 5% increase in coke consumption and a
5'3 increase in limestone consumption. The effect on pig iron output
alone of the lo4% increase in the ash content of coking coal received
by the company would be a reduction of about 50,000 tons per year when
ELS00 operates at full capacity.
28.       To assure itself of a steady supply of good quality coking coal,
therefore, the company has decided to exploit the large coal reserves at
its Chasnalla property, to improve and expand coal production at its JitDur
and Ramnagore collieries; and to install a ropeway from Jitpur and Chasnalla
to Burnpur to enable it to meet the bulk of its coal requirements without.
having to rely on the railroads.
Physical Description
Exploitation of Coal Fields
29.       Chasnalla.:  At the Chasnalla property, the company plans to sink
two double shafts to a depth of 1,200 ft. for underground mining and to open
up one opencast mine. The two deep mines would have rated daily cpacities
of 1,500 and 2,000 tons per day respectively, and the opencast mine 2,200
tons per day.
3n.       The opencast mine presents certain problems w'hich have not yet
been definitely resolved. About 4.0 million tons of the coal which would
be mined by opencast methods lie under the flood level of the Panchet Hi'l
Dam. To protect the open pit, the company is planningf to divert the
Domohani rivulet and to build bunds on the south side of the mining area
as shown on Map 4.  Tentatively, it is planned to build the buids to the
neight of the Panchet Dam gates (445 ft. above sea level) but the decision
is not yet final. The company is making a study with the help of DVC
engirieers to determine the maximum flood level that can be expected at
' Themorandum on the Conservation of Metallurgical Coal by the Tata
Ircn & Steel Co., Ltd. and the Indian Iron & Steel Company Limited.



- 8 -
Chasnalla and tc dccide whether the bunds should be built tc withstand
that flood level or whlether to build the bunds to the now planned level
and s'ispend opencast operaticns, if necessary, during the monsoon season.
The danger of flooding of the open-pit mine would be minimized by prompt
backfiJling of mined sections; exit ramps would be maintained to permit
a list withdrawal of men and equipment if necessary; and pumping equipment
of adequate capacity would be available to empty water collected during
the monsoon rains as well as the flood waters should the bunds be over-
topped.
31.       An interruption of operations at the opencast mine, which wro-aJd
provide between 20% and 50% (see Table II Para. 56) of the coal produced
by the company for about eight years, could be compensated for by stepning
up production from the deep mines and by maintaining an adequate stockpile
of coking coal at Burnpur, say about 220,000 tons (30 days' operation)J
By these means the company would be able to operate its coke ovens at ca-
pacity, even if the opencast mine were shut down for as long as three
ronths,
32,       Coal production from the opencast mine is expected to begin in
the second year and from the deep mines in the fourth and sixth years re-
spectively.  Chasnalla production would reach the planned output of 4,700
toxis per day (1.41 million tons per year) in the seventh year after work
en the project began, although full production from the underground mines
would not be reached until the eighth year. The opencast mine is estimated
to have a life of about ten years; thereafter the total coal requirements
would be met from the underground mines.
33.       Most of the opencast mine and the sand gathering stations which
the company plans to establish on the Damodar river are to be located on
land owined by the DVC.  The comptay will need to obtain leases
for these lands from the DVC under conditions that would give it access to
the river, to the sand storage dumps, the opencast mine and the area for
disposel of refuse from the opencast and deep mines. Negotiations between
DVC and IISCO are already under way.
34,       Jitpur:  This colliery is now producing about 700 tons per day
(210,000 tons per year). IISC0 plans to increase production to 1,500 tons
per day (450,000 tons per year) by deepening the present shafts to the
1,500 ft. level in order to reach a new coal seam below the present work-
ings. Full production from this colliery is expected in six yrears.
35.       Ramnagore:  The Ramnagore scheme includes the followiing:
Ramnagore A: An increase in production from, the existing mine
where production has been declining and now amounts to about 80,O0C tons
per year. The company is sinking a new sh&ft to a depth of 870 ft. and
plans to improve ventilation as well as to gather ancd transport sand for
stouwiing. Expected production is 1,000 tons per day (300,000 tons per year)
wituiii three years,,



-9-
nzagDre B: rlTh3  pening of a new mine by sinking new shafts to a
depth of 650 ft., about one mile away from the existing shafts of P.amiagore A.
These snafts would not be sunk until expansions at Burnpur make recesiery a
larger supply of coal. This work is not a part of the project under ccn-
sideraticn.
36.       Table I shows the main features of the coal mining operations at
the three properties.  The estimated capital investments shown below do not
include investments in sand gathering stations or ropeways for transportirg
sand to the mir.es, or investments in above-ground transportation of Coal
from the mines to loading ounkers for the main ropeway to Burnpur.

Send Gathering and TransDortation
37.       The company plans to replace coal removed from the deep mines by
sand. The practice of sand stowing is coi,mon in India; it meces possible
virtually complete recovery,, of the coal underground with safety. LecLusu
o2 the great thickness of the seams in Indian mines, only about 30% o'  the
coal can be removed unless coal removed is replaced by sand.  If larger
percentages are extracted, there is danger that the voids may collapse
w th consequent serious strata movements.  To permit recovery of almoet all
the coal with safety, the Indian coal producers remove coal from. one narrow
gallery after another, replacing the coal in each with said before going on
to the next.  IWhen the stowing is done properly, strata movements are almost
negligible. The governmient itself is planning a program to provide large
quantities of sand for stowing; to be used by private coal owners with the
a5m of recovering much of the 400 mirllion tons of -ood quality coal which
i  iv estinated have been left ir underground pillars.

38.       The companyts consultants estimate that when the coal mine3
reach full production, of 7,200 tons of coal per day (includirg ],200 tons
per day from the opencast mine) about 8,000 tons per day of sand will be
required for stowinge  The companyts plans for sand gathering and ropeway
transportatioia to the mines are as follows:
Chasnalla: Two new sand gathering plants on pontoons would
be installed on the Damodar river to pump a mixture of sand
and water to separators on the river banks. The sand world
be conveyed from the separators to ropeway bunkers by belts
and would be transported from these bunkers to storage
bunkers at the mines by two ropeways, each with a combined
capacity of 450 tons per hour.
Jitpur: The existing sand gathering station would be
improved to meet future demand and the ropeway realigned
to facilitate operations and maintenance.
Ramnagore A: The sand gathering station on the Barakar
river would be improved by the installation of pumps to
augment the capacity of the scraper now in use and of a
ropeway with a capacity of 120 tons per hour to transport
the sand to the mine. These improvements are almost com-
pleted using IISCO's own resources and only Rs.0.7 million
is needed under the project.
Ropewa-v Transportation of- Coal
39.       Coking coal for IISCO's Burnpur plant now comes by rail from
about 30 different collieries (Maps Nos. 1 and 2) located at from 10 to
30 vanles from the plant, with most of it coming from mines more than
iO m-lee away. To obtain coal of uniform quality for use in the blast
furnaces, the coal received must be blended.  This is possible only if
the company has adequate supplies of coal of proper qualities.  To assure
itself of a steady supply of coal, the company is planning to install a
ropeway from Chasnalla to Burnpur (Map No.3) and a feeder ropeway from
Jitpur to Chasnalla, to carry the coal from these two collieries to Burnpur.
In this way most of the company's coal requirements would be met from its
o-wn facilities.
40,       The ropeway would relieve the company of the difficulties it
now experiences in handling rail deliveries of coal and of the necessity
for 1-ubstantial investments in new handling facilities. Coal is ncu de-
livered in 20-ton cars, about half of which are closed cars, which require
a large amount of labor and extra time for unloading, The railwawr author-
ities are planning to put on 55-ton open cars for future coal maovemeints.
1ISC0 has no facilities for handling such large cars; its existing un2oadiing
faci'2ities, financed with IBRD funds and approved by the railways are su2 t-
able only for 20ton open cars.  Substantial expenditures woula be required
-G'cr the installation of facilities to handle the larger cars.



- 11 -
410       The ropevray from Chasnalla to Burnpur would be a 32-n.ile long,
5CO-ton per hour ropewey.  'The feetler ropeway from Jitpur to 'hesnella
wculd bG a 6-mile long, 200-ton per hour single ropeway.  The Chasnalla-
Burnpur ropeiwaay would have the capacity to cerry the tota-l output of un-
washed coal ,from both collieries, which would amount to about 6,200 tons
per day (1.9 million tons per year). The coal from these two collieries
would meet about 86,%, of Burnpur's requiremients.  The entire ropeway system
is expected to be compDleted in four years.
Coal Washing Plant
42.       The loading station at Chasnalla would have a set of bunkers for
storage and classification of coal which would permit the sending of the
right coal mixture to the coke ovens at Burnpur. Provision has also been
made for a coal washing plant since studies have indicated that it mEy be
necessarly to wash the entire output of the Chasnalla and Jitpur mi.nes in
order to maintain the ash content at a uniform level of 16'.  The coal
from Ramnagore will be hand picked only since its ash content is alreGdy
close to 16',  The clean coal yrield is expected to be about 80,` of the
raw coal feed. The clean coal is expected to reduce coke consumption
frov 2,400 lbs. to 2,000 lbs. of coke per ton of pig iron.
Coal Reserves, Sand Availabilitv, Utilities and Housing
43.       Coal Reserves:  The Chasnalla  propertyr is characterized by thle
steep inclination (330 to 45°)and buy the thickness of its coal seams; these
features make them particularly difficult to work. In addition, as was in-
dicated above, about half of the field lies below the hi£h flood level of
the Damodar river for several months of the year.  Some of the mineable
seams have been worked in the past to shallow depths and abandoned, and
They are filled with water at the present time;
i1.       Total reserves at Chasnalla are conservatively estLim;ted at 5n minl-
'ion tons of mineable c,oking coal of which 12 million tons are Proved and
the rest are Probable~/. The estimates are based mainly on recent borings,
but in part on records of past exploitation and on outcrops of the seams.
Sand stowing would perrit virtually comolete recovery of the coal.  The
mineable reserves include recoverable pillars from the old mines. At the
expected rate of extraction of 1.41 million tons per year the life of the
property is estimated at about 35 years.  Some of the reserves to be ex--
trauted b, underground mining lie directly under the bed of the Danodar
river tSee Nap No.4); to prevent floodinr, a ceiling 200 feet in thick-
ness would be left above the workings directly under the river bed.  The
reserves close to and underneath the river could be mined in the future
by cpening up a new+ shaft close to the northern bank of the Daniodar river.
The usefulness of such a development would be increased if the company
oould acquire mining rights for the coal reserves on the south side of
the river.
JFr-oven reserves are actual or blcked-out reserves, the existence of
which is beyund doubt.  Probable reserves include coal which, by direct
Llining experience and by drillmin, by continuity to existing workirgs
and areas drilled, can be reasonably expected to exist.



- 12 -
45.       It would be in IISCOts i,nterest to acquire mining rights to coal
l-ing under the village of Tasra to the east of the Cnasnalle propertyr a-na
as far as tihe Patardhi-Bhoujardhi railroad link to the west of the prope:ty.
These reserves, wbich would be easily accessible from the two deep mines
planned at Chasnalla, would extend the life of the coal property without
any additional expense except for normal mine development.
46.       The Jitpur collier, which is now being worked by IISCO, does not
present such difficult conditions as Chasnalla.  Coal would be produced, as
at present, from deep mines, and the practice of sand stowing would be con-
tinied.  Reserves at Jitpur are estimated at 14 million tons of mineabl3
coking coal and are all Proved.  At the planned output of 450,000 tons per
year, the life of this property is estimated at more than 30 yearse
47.       The Ramnagore colliers, where IISCO is also now producing coal
(at Remnagore A ilne,, has several intrusions but the inclination of the
^oal seams is much gentler than at Chasnalla.  The Ramnagore A colliery
has pro-ven reserves of about eight million tons of coking coal, mostly in
the form of recoverable pillars in comparatively recent workings.  Tnese
pllars would be recovered through sand stowing.  At the planned output of
300,000 tons per year, the life of the mire is estimated at about 25 yeams.
48.       The coal reserves of the three IISCO properties (Chasnalla, Jitpur
and Ramnagore A) down to the 1,200, 1,500 and 870 ft. levels, respectively,
amount in all to an estimated 72 million tons, of which 34 million tons are
Proved. Tot.al reserves should permit an output of 2.2 million tons per yea,
for more than 30 years.
4Q.       Sand Availability:  The 6,000 to 8, 000 tons a day of sand reqaired
for mine stowirng would be gathered from the Damodar and Barakar river beds.
The L±ain sand-gathering stations to supply the Chasnalla colliery would be
located near the point where the Domohani rivulet empties into the Damodar;
the Damodar river widens at that point, and it is expected that sand will
deposit at about the rate of extraction.
50.       The Indian Coal Board is itself installing several ropeways and
sand-gathering plants on the Damodar river to supply sand for stowing the
coal mines in the area around Chasnalla. For technical reasons, one of these
stations will be located downstream from the river front of the Chasnalla
property.  For that purpose, the Coal Board is taking about 500 ft. of r-ver
fcont fXom the company. To compensate for this loss, the Coal Eoard has
promined IISC0 the sand-gathering rights on a stretch of river front exterd-
ing upstream from IISCO's present concession to the Southeastern Ra3lwcy
bridge over the Damodar.
51.       The Jitpur colliery can also be supplied easily from the Damodar
river by a gathering station in an area previously owned by the Standard
Coal Company.  No problems in sand gathering are expected in this area,



- 13 -
5?.       Rarnagore A would be supplied as at present from the 9araka-r river;
the axisting sand-gathering plant would be excanded by the additicn of a
unit with a capacity of about 120 tons an hour.
53.       To ensure an adequate supplv of sand for mine stowing, if the
gathering sites which the company plans to deTelop do not continue to Nield
the required amounts, the company is studying alternative sand-gathering
sites.  It is also considerinr the possibilityv of recovering sand from the
overburden at the opencast mine, for use in the Chasnalla mines, or to use
crushed slag from the steel works which amounts to about 1,600 tons per day.
5/4.      Utilities:  Electric power reouirements are estimated as follows:
about 5,500 MJ for Chasnalla, including the ropewa3r, 2,000 Kl for Jitour and
1,000 KU for 2amnacore.  Power would be supplied by thie Bihar Electricity
Supply Board for Chasnalla and Jitpur. A long-term contract is now being
negotiated.  Power for Ramnagore will be supplied by the company from its
own facilities at Lulti.
55.       The company with very. minor exnenditures can rake available erough
housing units at Jitpur and Ramna-ore A when the expansion program reauires
the hiring of additional workers. At Chasnalla, where close to 2,000 workers
will be needed when the mines reach full capacity, construction of louses
wJould be started when work in the mines begins, under the Coal IKlines velfare
Hoisinc.' schemes financed by the Indian Government.  However, the comnainy mray
be forced to build sore houses itself at Chasnalla, or, as a stop-vap, to
repair old houses available there.
Construction Schedule and Production Pattern
56.       It is estimated that it would take eight years to complete the
full development of the coal Droperties.  Coal production is exDected tc
reach the plarned maximuam of 2.16 million tons per year in the seventh year
after construction begins.  The scheduled increase in productMon from the
present level of 260,000 tons per year is showm in Table II.

57.       Saxd &athering and transportation facilities, in particular at
ChasnJ.lla, should be completed during the third year;  The ma-n ropeway
woald be complated before the fourth year, when production from Chasnaila,
estimated at about S1,0000 tons during that year, would make its operation
essent,'aLO
58,       When the coal reserves of the opencast mine are exhausted (See
Para. 32) the company can maintain production of 2.1 million tons per year
by further -mndarground develcpment from the deep mines or by opening a new
shaft et Chasnalla (No.1 South Niine) or Ramnagore B mine.
Enuineering and Construction Management
59.       The International Construction Company Ltd., London, the companyts
consultinig engineers, are responsible for the design, engineering, procure-
rent ar.d managenient of construction of the coal mining and ropeway projec6s.
TOG will retain the services of qualified coal mining consultants during
the construction period and starting up of the mining operations.. These
arrangements for engineering and construction are satisfactory.
Training Proqram
60.       Funds in local currency and foreign exchange have been allocated
to provide qualified technicians for training the local workers. A train-
ing program would be undertaken at the Jitpur and Ramnagore A collieries
when the modernization of deep mining facilities gets under wayc

62.       The estimates include 551 for escalation, 10%p for engineering and

1961, are for the most part based on prelimina:y quotatiors for major items.
The company's consultants have given assurance that adequate contingencies
already have been included in the direct cost estimates of equipment and
installations and in view of this the conti ngency and other allowances in-
cluded above appear to be adequate.

3tatii of Engineerin.E Procurement and Construction
63.       IISC0 has accepted tha recommendations of their consulting
encineers on the mining methods to be uised in the different mines as well
as on the major production equipment to be pvrchased.  These recomrnend a-
tions have been reviewed and accepted in principle ;5y the Bank consultants.
General specifications have beeni prepared and used in the calculation oZ
the cost estimates.  Detailed construction plans are now being prepared.
64.       Procurement will be based upon international comipetition to the
fullest extent practicable.
IV, ECo0OMI0C BENEFITS
65.       The economic benefits that IISC0 would derive from becoming
sel'-sulfficient in coking coal are many, but their monetary value is
difficult to determine.
66.       It is estimated that the cost of coal from Chasnal'a, Jitpur
and Ramnagore, when these mines operate at full capacity, would be from
10'/J to 15% below the prices fob mine paid by the company to present
supnliers,  The cost of coal transportation by ropeway from Chasnalla
and Jitpur to Burnpur (for 855' of total coal produced) is estimated at
JLrom 10% to 20% below nresen+ railway freight rates from present mines.
67,,      It is more difficult to estimate the value to the company of
securing coal of uniform quality, but this feature is probably of the
greatest value to it. The coal delivered to Burnpur at present varies
considerably in quality, and blending becomes almost impossible. By
reducing the number of collieries from which the company would receive
coal from 30 to 3, and installing plants to clean and blend the coal,
the company would be assured of a supply much hi-her and more lmiform
in quality than its present supply. Control of ash content and coking
coefficients, should result in an increase in steel production and an
immrovement in its quality.  It is expected to have a reduction in coke
consumption from 2,400 to 2,000 lbs. per ton of pig iron using washed
coal with an ash content of 16,
68.       The installation of the ropeway, Jitpur-Chasnalla-Burnpur,
would guarantee the company a steady suppl- of coal.

of Rs.138.4 million ($P29.1 million equivalent) estimated to be paid
on the preferred and common stock durin- the construction period,
2/ Includes an amount of Rsol6.7 million ("3.5 million equivalent) for
interest and other chearges durin- construction.
72.       The above estimates include a provisional increase of Rs.45 per
ton in steel retentioln prices recently granted by the Government of india
for the two years 1960/1961 2nd 1961/1962.  The estimates also include an
additional increase of Rs.25 per ton (to cover the same period as t'ne poro-
visional increase) which the comoany estimates the government will grant
prior to Narch 31, 1962.  Including an increase of Rs.16 per ton recently
submritted, the company has requested that retention prices be raised by
Rs,93 per ton.  The estimates used in this report assume the company will
receive a Rs,70 per ton increase (See Annex 1).
73.       During the construction period of the coal mining project the
company also plans to undertake two smaller projects. The first involves
the formation of, and an investment in, a subsidiary (to be 66.7/' owned
by IISC0) that will manufacture spun pipe. It is presently anticipated
that construction will begin in 1963/1964 and will require an investment
by IISCO of Rs.20 million.  Tlhe second undertaking will consist of an
expansion of the present facilities at Kulti to enable the company to
manufacture steel rolls.  The cost of this project is estimated at PLs.15
million and construction is tentatively scheduled for 1965/1966.  The
companSr has agreed to finance these projects solely through the sale of
nez share capital presently estimated at Rsc35 million (See Para. 71).
74,       In addition to the application and source of funds indicated
above (Paras. 70-71), the company also intends to utilize existing over-
draft facilities (Para. 23) by drawin-~ dovn Rs.20 million (Ž4A,2 million
equivalent) for additional wzorking capital durinr the fiscal year ending
Earch 31, 1962. The projections (Annex 6) provide for the repayment of
this drourt and an additional Ps.1.7 million (&'.4 million equivalent)
presently outstanding, by 1iarch 31, 1965.



- 19 -
75.       The company also plans to finance part of the constraction costs
of the proposed uroject through the sale of investments estimated to
generate Rs.36.1 million net after taxes.
76.       For purposes of calculation, the proposed Bank loan of $19,500,000
(Rs.92,820,000 equivalent) has been assumed to 3arry interest at 5 A/4O'
(with a comm,.itment fee of 3/4 of 1,6; per annum) and to have a term of
12 years (including a five-year grace period), The loan includes 43,500,000
(Rs.16,600,000 equivalent) for interest and other charges during construc-
tion. Debt service would be based on even semi-annual payments.
77,       The financing plan for the proposed project is satisfactory.
Financial ProsDects
78,       The financial projections indicate that the company's pre-tax
preflits should remain at about the 1961 level during the construct-on
period anld increase slowly thereafter as interest charges decline. Since
the effect of expanded coal production on the company's improved steel
operations is difficult to predict, the estimates, therefore, of steel
production and average works cost may prove to be too conservative.
79.       Interest charges on the company's present debt are well covered.
Interest requirements, excludin!g interest during construction on the
proposed loan, are covered 5.5 times by net income after taxes plus
interest in fiscal 1962/1963 (when the coverage is the lowest) and increase
to 109 times in fiscal 1965/1966.  Total debt service coverage during
the construction period averages 2.3 timles. Considerinr- that the interest
during construction on the proposed loan is excluded, debt servLce is
rather low,  This situation improves sharply, however, after fiscal
1967/1968 when the present IBRD loans and the Government loan mature.
Another factor contributing to low debt service coverage is the relatively
low return on total capitalization (net income plus intereot amounted to
9.11 of total capitalization in 1961).
SO.       The debt/equity ratio, forecast at 32:68 at larch 31, 1962,
improves steadily to 15:85 at the end of the construction period due to
the amortizations of the two outstanding IRED loans and goverrnment looa,
a proposed increase in share capital, and retained earnings.
81.       The current ratio of the company is poor and has been deterior-
ating since 1956. One factor which caused the recent decline is that
IISC0 has incurred additional operating expenses and at March 31, 1961
had not been compensated for them in the form of an increase in retenzion
prices. Retention price increases (Para. 72) should improve the liquid-
ity situation. The current ratio of the compEmy improved in 1960/61 since
IISC0 funded approximately Rs.40 rillion of current liabilities owed to
the Iron and Steel Controller by issuing long-term bonds to the Govern-
ment, IUhile the current ratio is still low it should be noted that
several items listed as current liabilities are of a long-term nature.



- 20 -
In addition, under an agreement entered into with the Government of India
in July 1953, the Government is obligated until late 1967 to make working
capital availabile to the company if the company is unable to raise it in
the market (See Annex 9).
82.       The proposed financing plan assumes that during the construction
program the companay will utilize Rs.20 million of ovrerdraft facilities.
The company has access to an additional Rs,52.3 of short-term credit
(Para. 23) which can be used if the government delays the additional
increase in retention prices (Rs.25 per ton) estimated by the company
and included in the projections or if wlorking capital requirements or
local currency costs exceed the present estimates.
VI, PROTECTIVE MRANGEIENTS
83.       Under the existing Loan Agreements with the Bank, the Bank loans
have been secured by a first fixed mortgage and a first floating charge
upon the company's properties. In order to give the proposed loan senior
status, it would be secured par  passu with the existing IBRD loans by
amendment of their present Trust Deeds and by the subordination of the
Government of India loan and the Second Mortgage Debenture Stock,
84.       Existing provisions contained in the Loan Agreements, such as a
limitation of Rs.50 million on short-term borrowings for ordinary business
requirements, having a security ranking in priority to or pari passu with
the floating charge securing the Bank loan, and debt limitations restrict-
ing consolidated indebtedness to consolidated unimpaired capital and sur-
plus, are incorporated in the proposed Loan Agreement.
85.       In order to conserve local currency and to assure the completion
of the coal mining project, a covenant has been incorporated in the Loan
Agreement which prevents ITSCO (uring the construction period) from under-
taking any new ventures or expansion of present facilities if the total
aggregate estimated cost tlhereof would exceed RsO10 million unless the
financing plan is approved by the Bank. Specifically exermpt from this
aggregate estimated cost are the spun pipe and steel roll projects
(Para. 73) on the basis that IISCO's total investment in these projects
will be financed from the sale of new issues of a long-term nature.
86.       The company cannot draw down more than S;6 million equivalent
from the Loan Account until security arrangements have been made which
are satisfactory to the Bank.
87.       In connection with the Government Agreement of 1953 (See
Annex 9) a provision has been included in the Loan IAgreement which makes
the cancellation or amendment of this agreement without the consent of
the Bank, an additional event of default.



- 21 -
88.       In order for the proposed loan to become effective the borrower
will have to satisfy the Barn that the borrower will be able to obtain
the following:
a)   A lease from DVC under suitable conditions for lands
at Chasnalla to enable the company to gain access to
the Damodar river and to install sand gathering
stations and sand storage dumps there as well as to
gain access to areas for the disposal of refuse from
the opencast and deep mines,
b)   The sand gathering rights from the Coal Controller
on a stretch of river front extending from IISCO's
present concession to the Southeast Railroad Bridge
over the Damodar.
c)   Long-term contracts for its power requirements
for the operation of the collieries and the
ropeway from the Bihar Electricity Supply Board.
d)   A lease from the Bihar State Government for the
surface rights of land at Chasnalla required for
the diversion of the Domohani river and for the
operation of the opencast mine.
VII.  CONCLUSIONS
89.       IISCO's coal mining and ropeway project is sound and would
provide the company with a steady supply of coking coal of satisfactory
quality. The project would be a suitable basis for a Bank loan of $19.5
milllion equivalent for a term of 12 years including a five-year grace
period. The Government of India has agreed to guarantee the loans
December 14, 1961



ANNIE  1
THE COIs\iTPOL OF THE INDIAN STEEL INDUSTRY
During and since the war, the Indiar. Government has exercised a
comprehensive control over the steel industry. Domestic producers have
been told what to produce and what prices to charge for their products.
Part of the sales price (the excess over what is kno1-m as the "'retention
price") must be paid by the producers to the Iron and Steel Controller to
form an Equalization Fund, which is used partly to subsidize imported steel,
but in part also to provide funds for the expansion of the industry. Until
1955, the retention prices were calculated so as to yield to producers only
a modest return on their investment over their costs of production.
To facilitate the subsequent expansion of the industry, the Govern-
ment fixed new uniform retention prices for the two major producers (Tata
Iron and Steel Company, Limited, and the Indian Iron and Steel Company,
Limited), to run for five years ending March 31, 1960.  These prices in-
cluded a "developrent allowance", to be earmarked for current expansion
progra,ns. In IISCO's case this development allowance amounted to Rs. 7
per ton out of a total estimated average retention price of Ps. 393 per ton.
For two years after ,iiarch 1960, in accordance with an agreement
between IISCO and the Government made in June 1955, the retention prices
for categories of steel made by IISCO must be the same as those for all
other major producers of steel (whether privately or publicly owned). For
categories not made by other producers, IISCO's retention prices must be
fixed on a comparable basis.  After L*arch 1962, the whole system of steel
pricing is to be reviewred in the light of developments.
A provisional increase of Rs. 45 per ton in steel retention prices
was recently granted by the Government of India for the two years 1960/61
and '961j62,  The Tariff Commission has now taken up the question of firm
prices for these two years and IISCO has subiitted a claim for r.s.40 over
th1e preseut provisional prices.
The June 1955, agreement contains the following escalation clause:
"The retention prices so fixed for the various categories
of steel will be adjusted from time to time to the extent
that the Government of India is satisfied that manufactur-
ing costs have altered from the 1954/1955 level as a result
of changes in railway freights, chLnces in statutory prices
of coal ard other fuel, rawr materials, stores or machinery,
and changes in labor costs caused by labor legislation or
adjudication or conciliation awards."

THE IRDIAIT IRON AND STEEL CONPANY LIMITED
Notes and Assumptions for Financial Tables
1,        A number of items in the income statements and balance sheets
have been reclassified in accordance with Bank practice.  This classifi-
cation differs in some respects from that used in the companygs published
financial statements.
2.        IISCO would receive a loan of f19e5 million equivalent from the
Bank for 12 years from February 1, 1962, including a grace period of five
years at an interest rate of 5 3/4%, with a commitment fea of 3/4 of 1JD
Debt service is based on even semi-annual installments due February 1,
and August 1.  The first repayment would be February 1, 1967.  The initial
interest payments are based on the following assumed disbursement schedule:
August 1, 1962 - Rs.31,110,000; August 1, 1963 - Rs.21,957,000; August 1,
)964 - Rsc15,286,000; August 1, 1965 - Rso6,533,0CO; A-ugust 1, 1966 -
Rs.1,304,0000
3.        All debt:equity ratios have been calculated in accordance with
Section 5.05 of Bank Loan 159-IN. For purposes of calculation runder Section
5.05 "indebtedness" excludes commercial and trade liabilities incurred in
the ordinary course of business and payable not more than one year from
the date of calculation. Included as commercial and trade liabilities and
exempt from the formula, are accrued liabilities to the Indian Iron and
Steel Controller. Obligations to bankers or in respect of deposits ac-
cepted by the borrower are not to be treated as commercial and trade lia-
bilities and are therefore to be included as "indebtedness". To be in-
cluded as "capital and surplus" and excluded as "indebtedness" is govern-
ment advances.  "Consolidated indebtedness" is to include subsidiary debt
but excluide intercorporate debt. "Capital and surplus" means capital and
surplus determined in accordance with sound accounting procedure0 "Con-
solidated capital and surp'lus" means total capital and surplus of the
company and its subsidiaries after excluding such items of capital and
surplus of the company which represent equity interest of the company in
any subsidiary and any items which represent equity interest in the com-
pany held by the subsidiary or any other subsidiary.
4.        The terms of the government advance to IISCO are summarized as
follows:  the advance has no fixed maturity and will bear no interest before
June 30, 1958, or such later date as may be mutually agreed on.  After that
date the Government will set repayment terms and interest, if any.  The
Government may call upon the company at any time to issue additional share
capital for repayment of all or part of the advance, subject to agreement
on the terms, conditions and timing of any such issue.  The outstanding
balance of the advance (with interest, if any) will be repayable only from
a special addition to the company's retention price, or if control of steel
prices has been lifted, from the surplus of the company's sales returns over
thuoretical retention prices. If by harch 31, 1969, the advance is not
entirely repaid, the Government will decide on the mode of its repayment.

5.        The company does not follow a policy of automatically adjusting
depreciation charges as assets increase. The depreciation charge can
only be increased with the authorization of the Board of Directors. As
the company did not wish to anticipate what action the Directors might
take, it used a figure of Rs.37.5 million (the present authorization) all
the way through its projections. The Bank has increased this charge as
indicated in its projections and reduced the forecast of taxes accordingly.
6.        The company does not believe it is reasonable to make projections
beyond the year ending 1Narch 31, 1968, As the outstanding Bank loans
(71-IN and 159-IN) both mature in that year, interest coverage and debt
service coverage will improve substantially after that year and forecasts
after that date were not considered reliable or necessary.
7.        The increase of Rs.S87 million in working capital in 1962 is
assumed to be applied Rso4.0 million to inventories and Rs.4.7 million
to accounts receivable.
Se        Interest at 5% on bank overdrafts has been included in "Interest-
Other" for the appropriate periods.
9.        Taxes are calculated at 45% of Net Income before Taxes less
tax credit for development rebates estimated by the company for the fiscal
years ending March 31, as follows:  1962, Rs.l.O million; 1963, Rs.2.0 mil-
lion; 1964, None; 1965, Rs.14.O million; 1966, Rsl.O million; 1967, Rs.2.0
million.
10.       In order to calculate the dividend requirements on the projected
sale of capital shares it is assumed that new share capital can be sold
at Rs.20 per share, net to the company (Present market Rs.25 per share).
The proceeds in excess of the RselO per share par value was credited to
Capital Surplus and it was assumed that IISCO will maintain the present
dividend rate of 16% on share capital.



ANNEX 9
GOVERNTEIT AGREEIENT
In July 1953, and in connection with an expansion program
financed in part by  BDTD Loan 71-IN, IISCO entered into an agreement
with the Government of India, Um-der this arrangem;ent the Government
agreed to maee a long-term loan to the company and also, as long as
any part of the Government or IBRD loans is outstanding, to make
working capital available to IISCO, at reasonable terms,s if at any
time ths company is unable to raise such capital upon fair terms
from private sources. The final amortization of the IBRD loan is
due in October 1967 and the final payment to the Government is due
in December 1967,
It is the opinion of both counsel for the Bank and the com-
pany that if, prior to December 1967, the company requires additional
workirg capital and it is unable to raise such capital upon fair terms
from private sources, thea tiis Government of India is obligated to make
it available to them, provided the company shall so request,
