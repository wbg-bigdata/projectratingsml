PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is a project completion report (PCR) of the Third Highway
Project for which Loan 1856/Credit 1030-PNG were approved in May 1980 for the
combined sum of US$30.0 million.
The PCR was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Transportation
Division, based upon a review of the project's files and data supplied by the
Department of Works and Supply and also the Department of Transport, Port
Moresby, PNG. Bank staff who worked on the project have also been inter-
viewed.
In accordance with the revised project performance reporting
procedures this report has been read in the Operations Evaluation Department
(OED) but the project was not audited by OED staff. The draft Completion
Report was sent to the Borrower for comments; however, none were received.

PAPUA NEW GUINEA
THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1856/CREDIT 1030-PNG)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Highlights
The Third Highway Project continued the Bank's assistance to the
Government of Papua New Guinea for improving its road transport system. The
project supported the Government's rural development strategy by financing a
major expansion of the main highway in the highlands of PNG.
The project achieved most of its objectives. The civil works were
executed by foreign contractors who were supervised by the Department of Works
and Supply, assisted by Consultants (3.04). This component experienced
considerable delays due mainly to difficulties in land acquisition and the
provision of the right of way (3.02). The other components, which were the
design of a maintenance program (3.06), the conduct of rural transport studies
(3.10) and equipment procurement (3.12), were all well executed. Also,
despite cost overruns, the economic rate of return was only slightly lower
than anticipated at appraisal (6.03).
A prominent feature of the project was its contribution to devel-
oping the Borrower's implementation capacity through the training of some PNG
engineers who were assigned to the consulting team (5.02). They were able to
gain considerable contract management experience which tLey can now apply to
other ongoing projects.
The main lesson learned is the need to pay greater attention to
soils investigations at tne design stage, given the young geological age of
the highlands area and the frequent earth tremors (3.03). Some of the
problems which occurred during construction, specifically side slope
instability and the need for additioa.al earthworks might well have been
avoided if the detailed engineering had been done better.

THIRD HIGHWAY PROJECT (LOAN 1856/CREDIT 1030-PNG)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. Project Backagound and Sectoral Setting
The Transport Sector
1.01      Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a sparsely populated island nation, with
widely scattered centers of economic activity. In the recent past, the PNG
economy has shown little growth, averaging 2.0Z p.a. since the 1970s. This
was due to the virtual recession since 1979 in the modern sector (dominated by
copper and gold mining) and modest growth in the traditional sector (subsis-
tence agriculture) of the economy. The entire economy is dependent on imports
and exports but, due to the topography, transport is difficult and expen-
sive4 The transport system reflects the country's geography, topography and
population distribution. It relies heavily on highways, interisland and
coastal shipping for freight transport and on air transport for passenger
movements; there is no railway.
1.02      Most transport takes place in the relatively few richer areas, con-
verging on the major ports at Lae and Port Moresby on the mainland, and on
mineral-rich islands. Transport volumes remain low; not considering copper
and timber exports which move through specialized ports, overseas tonnage in
1984 totalled some 1.4 million tons of which almiost one half was due to fuel
imports. Coastal shipping carried some 350,000 tons and 26,000 passengers.
Some 1.2 million passengers and a little (about 100 tons) freight travel by
air annually. There are no data on traffic volumes and distances by small
boats and trucks but they would not be as important as other traffic flows,
Generally, other modes lost freight to road transport as more roads were
opened, while passengers continued to prefer air travel.
1.03      The Government is aware of the inadequacies in the transport
system. Tariffs are high, transport operations overregulated, the safety
record poor, maintenance expensive, and there is a shortage of trained person-
nel. Since domestic construction capacity is in its infancy, major works
require foreign contractors. In this scenario, the PNG Government has placed
emphasis on reducing transport costs and also providing better land transport
and improved services to the rural areas, where most people live. The Govern-
ment is also using a system of contract management (a variation of force
account works) to implement major projects and help develop domestic
construction capacity.
1.04      The Bank's purpose in lending for transport was basically to support
rural development. Bank involvement has been directed at improved road main-
tenance, development of local contractors, and training of PNG civil
engineers. In addition the projects have included the rehabilitation and
improvement of roads and bridges as well as expanding port throughput
capacity. A summary of Bank investments follows:

The Road Subsector
1.05      PNG has a road network of some 18,600 km of which approximately
1,120 km are paved. Trunk roads total 5,000 km; they serve mainly the rela-
tively more populated areas around provincial capitals and coastal centers
from which they radiate. Regional networks are generally not interconnected;
only recently has the Highlands Highway provided an all weather long distance
(430 km) connection, from the highlands to the coastal city of Lae. It
carries about 400 to 600 vehicles per day (vpd); this is much more than the
typical trunk road volume of 150 vpd, most of which are utilitarian vehi-
cles. Investments over the last ten years have not significantly expanded the
network but rather served to upgrade sections with highest traffic that justi-
fied higher standards. The condition of most provincial roads remains poor,
with weak bridges and, in general, deficient drainage which impedes traffic
during heavy rains.
1.06      Registered motor vehicles totalled some 51,000 in 1981, the last
year for which complete data are available. The average growth rate during
1971-81 was 3% p.a. Small utilitarian vehicles and buses registered the
highest rate increases, with cars declining in number but still making up one
fourth of the registered fleet. Utilitarian vehicles now account for 45% of
registered vehicles; trucks for only about 15%, reflecting their lesser suita-
bility to the low-standard network; buses, for 5%, and mostly used in towns.
1.07      The Bank Group's assistance has included acting as executing agency
for the UNDP-financed transport survey of 1968-69. This transport survey
provided the framework for the reorganization of transport administration,
identification of issues and the preparation of an initial investment
program. Subsequently, the first two Bank Group-financed highway projects



- 3 -
provided major assistance for improvement and paving of over 200 km of the
Highlands Highway. The projects also included components for (a) institution-
building in the Department of Works and Supply (DWS) and in the Department of
Transport (DT); (b) f2rmulation and revision of transport sector policies; and
(c) technical assistance and training for transport personnel. The policy
changes supported by the project included the relaxtion of excessive transport
regulationst better cost recovery and the use of more appropriate road design
standards.
1.08      The Third project continued to promote the development of the
highlands region and also addressed the problems of road maintenance through-
out the country. This report reviews the progress made under the Third
project based on information provided by the DWS, the DT and a review of the
Bank Group's files in Washington, D.C. Bank staff who are familiar with the
project have also contributed to this review.
II. PROJECT FORMULATION
Preparation Stage
2.01      The project arose originally out of the findings of the UNDP trans-
port survey which focused on the need to continue development in the Highlands
region. Feasibility studies and preliminary engineering were subsequently
carried out by the DWS, assisted by a team of foreign consultants and were
completed by early 1979. At appraisal the detailed engineering had been
completed and contractors prequalified.
.
Project Objectives
2.02      The main objective was to support the development of the Central
Highlands region by helping the Government complete its program of improvement
to the Highlands Highway. Other objectives were (i) to improve the standard
of road maintenance in the country through technical assistance, training and
support of organizational reform; and (ii) to assist in developing a national
capacity for identifying, preparing and implementing a large number of small
scale rural transport projects.
Appraisal Stage
2.03      The appraisal mission, composed of an engineer and an economist,
visited PNG in October 1979 and reviewed the project proposals. These
included the detailed engineering, economic evaluation, bid documents and
other information requested previously by the Bank.
2.04      Several issues were raised at appraisal, including:
(a) Loan amount. Initially, US$22.0 million had been allocated for this
project, but appraisal estimates showed that at least US$28.4 siil-
lion was needed to cover the foreign cost component. The mission
recommended that the Bank increase its participation in project
financing to cover all foreign exchange costs.



-4-
(b) Availability of counterpart funds. Implementation of the project
was scheduled to commence in late 1980 for which counterpart funds
of K 5.0 million (US$ 7.0 million) was needed. The Government had
by then allocated K 3.0 million for this project in its budget. The
mission recommended that adequate allocation in its 1980 National
Public Expenditure Plan (NPEP) budget be a condition of loan/credit
effectiveness.
(c) User charges. The Government subsidized all transport modes, in
particular road and air transport. It was estimated that road users
paid only 17% of total road investment costs and about 50% of main-
tenance costs. For air transport, the revenues collected from users
were only about 25% of costs. The Government had then recently
completed a thorough study of transport user charges. Its then
Department of Transport and Civil Aviation (DTCA) had also produced
a program of specific changes as well as a draft transport policy
paper which addressed this and other (regulation) issues. The mis-
sion recommended that during negotiations the Bank should obtain a
statement from the Government on (i) its general transport pricing
policy; and (ii) the proposed level and timing of future changes.
(d) Deregulation. All transport modes in PNG were then considered to be
overregulated. The road transport industry was licensed under the
Heavy Vehicle Act which allocated licenses by route and capacity.
This licensing system was inefficient and hindered the entry and
competition for rates and services. in recognition of this the DTCA
was about to undertake a brief study of deregulation proposals. The
mission recommended that the results of this study be made available
for discussion at negotiations and that agreements be reached on
deregulation. These agreements were to be presented to the National
Executive Council as a condition of loan/credit effectiveness.
2.05      Loan negotiations were held in Washington in April 1980.  The
Government and the Bank Group agreed on a number of points, the principal ones
being:
(a) the loan/credit amount would be increased to US$30.0 million. The
IDA amount would be US$13.0 million and the IBRD portion US$17.0
million. Also the Governmer agreed to provide timely and adequate
counterpart funding;
(b) the Government would prepare a proposal on general transport pricing
policy to increase road user charges progressively to a level suffi-
cient to cover, by December 31, 1986, the cost of maintenance and
administration of the infrastructure;
(c) the draft program, submitted by the PNG delegation, setting out the
principles and timing for reviewing regulations governing the truck-
ing industry;



- 5 -
(d) the Government would p-epare guidelines on the steps to be taken to
support the development and strengthening of domestic road
contractors.
Project Description
2.06      The project, as negotiated, consisted of the following:
(a)  improvement and paving of about 137 km of the Highlands Highway
between Kassam Pass and Daulo Pass;
(b) a program of road maintenance of national, provincial and village
roads;
(c) the provision of traffic counting equipment;
(d) studies and detailed engineering of the Togoba-Wapenamanda road
(67 km), to be carried out with the assistance of consultants; and
,e) technical assistance for preparation of rural road transport
projects.
2.07      The appraisal report, No. 2838a-PNG was dated April 24, 1960.  The
project was approved by the Executive Directors in May 1980 and Loan Agreement
No. 1856-PNG (US$ 17.0 million, for 20 years including 5 years of grace with
interest at 8.25% p.a.) together with Development Credit Agreement No. 1030
(US$13.0 million at standard IDA terms) were signed on September 16, 1980.
The Loan/Development Credit Agreements became effective on November 6, 1980.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Overview
3.01      Contracts for road construction were awarded after minor delays.
However, actual progress was slow due mainly to the land acquisition problems
typical of construction works in PNG. The Kassam-Daulo Pass Highway was
completed about one year behind schedule. T.ie rural transport study was suc-
cessfully completed by various consultants in 1982. The road maintenance
study was completed in late 1985, considerably behind schedule; similatly pro-
curement of the traffic counting equipment was late. The project had a 48%
cost overrun in kina due mainly to increased volumes of earth and drainage
works on the Kassam-Daulo Pass Highway.
Road Construction and Paving
3.02      The Government awarded the contract ti the lowest bidder (an
Australian firm) in June 1980, some months before loan/credit effectiveness.
Works execution commenced well but the rate of pi'gress was quickly reduced to
much below expectations for a variety of reasons. For example, due to the
heavy rainfall and high soil moisture content the contractor experienced dif-



ficulty in compacting fill material. Also there were severe difficulties
relating to land acquisition, disputes over compensatihn to local landowners
and the leasing of borrow pits. The contractor was often denied access to
various work sites and to borrow areas by local people; this resulted in the
submission of many claims by the contractor. Problems were also experienced
with unstable, steep hillsides where slope stability was a continuous
problem. Later on civil unrest and security problems in the area, as well as
labor strife made progress even more difficult. Also the contractor's manage-
ment organization was for some time not fully adequate and the equipment
available was inappropriate for certain tasks. All of these slowed
construction to the extent that it was only 62% completed by the expected
date.
3.03      Most of these problems were eventually rectified and the construc-
tion finally completed to a satisfactory standard by December 1984, about
16 months behind schedule. There was a 55% cost overrun (K 24.9 million esti-
mated vs. K 38.8 million actual, including claims) but this was due mostly to
the major increases in earthwork qt.antities which were in turn due to the high
incidence of unstable side slopes encountered. The difficulty in establishing
and maintaining stable cut side slopes has always plagued road construction in
the highlands area. The necessity for revising side slope designs, improving
drainage in the field and repairing slope failures not only increased the
earthwork quantities but also caused substantial delays in progress of the
works.  Eventually most of the problems having to do with slope stability were
resolved by flattening side slopes and improving drainage. However, this
problem was basically unavoidable because the highway construction was in a
young geological area with unstable soils which were subject to excessively
high rainfall and frequent earth tremors.
3.04      Supervision of the work was carried out in a satisfactory manner by
a team of foreign consultants in association with a local firm. Reporting was
prompt and in adequate detail for monitoring of the project. Also the
consultant/contractor relationship was good.
3.05      The actual total length of road constructed totalled 138 km.  It was
handed over to the DWS maintenance organization.
Technical Assistance for Road Maintenance
3.06      Consultants (a Danish firm) were initially selected in 1981 by DWS
to provide technical assistance in road maintenance and staff tra.ning, but
they never really started work. This was because the DWS experienced diffic-
ulty in getting the National Executive Council to approve the consultants sub-
mission at a time when there was considerable debate over the phasing of this
component. In the end, the Government decided to divide it into two phases;
first a study to determine maintenanke needs, and second, an implementation
phase. The first phase was to form a basis for a continuing program to up-
grade the maintenance capability of the DWS and provincial authorities. It
thus became necessary to revise terms of reference to reflect the phasing and
invite new consultant's sulbmissions.  A British firm was finaLly selected in
April 1983.



- 7 -
3.07      Under Phase I of the study, the technical assistance staff
identified road maintenance needs and made recommendations for improvement in
planning, programming, executing, monitoring and cost accounting for road
maintenance operations. Under Phase Is, the consultants provided two road
maintenance experts to assist DWS in establishing a maintenance unit in order
to improve the efficiency of road maintenance operations. The consultants
issued a final operational report in June 1985 which dealt with all aspects of
the road maintenance program. This represented a significant contribution to
improved maintenance practices in PNG.
3.08      The actual implementation of some of these proposals will be carried
out by the DWS under the proposed Tcansport Improvement Project.
Technical Assistance for Road Transport
3.09      This component was executed by DTCA, which later became the
Department of Transport when civil aviation was separated from it in 1985. A
joint venture consulting team (West German/UK) was selected from a field of
five proposals in mid-1980. Due to budgetary constraints at DT, and also due
to unavailability of consultant staff, work did not commence until January
1981.
3.10      The objective was to prepare rural transport programs in five
selected provinces which would become components of a proposed Rural Transport
Project. This initial road screening and selection was all satisfactorily
carried out by mid-1982. Subsequently, engineering studies to help with the
preparation of the project were carried out by another group of consultants.
Some of the roads selected were eventually financed as part of the ongoing
Road Improvement Project (Ln. 2265-PNG) and others were done by the provinces
themselves.
Engineering of the Togoba-Wapenamanda Road
3.11      Under this component, feasibility studies for a 67 km road section
were to be carried out and detailed engineering and economic analysis com-
pleted for the first 25 km for which DWS engaged Australian consultants in
early 1982. However, the Bank, in a letter of July 20, 1982, decided not to
finance this consultancy contract because this contract had been signed and
the work undertaken without the Bank having been given the opportunity to
review the TOR or the contract itself. Later on the contract was terminated
by the DWS owing to dissatisfaction with the consultant's performance.
Detailed engineering on the Togoba-Tambul section was subsequently completed
by the DWS itself in 1984 and its construction will be financed under the
ongoing Road Improvement Project, L-2265-PNG.
Purchase of Equipment
3.12      The project included the provision of equipment to be used in
setting up a traffic counting system. The system of some 22 counting stations
required about 25 traffic counters and 50 cassettes to record traffic
volumes. After a long delay, the DT proceeded with the procurement of the
equipment in mid-1983. ICB was used and the equipment finally procured and



some of it installed by end 1985. It is expected that by end 1986, DT will be
able to carry out traffic counts accurately as part of an effort to collect
traffic statistics through the country.
IV. PROJECT COST AND BANK LOAN/IDA CREDIT
Project Cost
4.01      The total cost of the project, including contingencies, was about
K 44.67 million or US$55.15 million equivalent. This represents a cost over-
run of about 48% in kina overall and 30% in US dollars, reflecting the depre-
ciation of the currency. Most of this was due to the large cverrun in civil
works cost, actually there were savings in all other componetnts except land
acquisition. The reasons for the civil works cost overruns arose mainly from
the large additional quantities of earthworks needed (para. 3.03). Project
costs are detailed in Table 2.
Loan/Credit Disbursements
4.02      Cumulative disbursements (detailed in Table 3) compared to appra.sal
estimates are as follows:
FY81      FY82       FY83       FY84      FY85
…US$ million ------…---------
Appraisal      9.30     18.00      26.00      29.50      30.00
Actual         6.01      8.99      15.21      26.32      30.00
Although disbursements started slowly, they were _ompleted as scheduled. This
was faster than the typical Bank project in PNG.
Reallocation of Loan/Credit Funds
4.03      Disbursements on thp, loan/credit were completed in November 1984.
The following table shows the original and actual allocation of loan/credit
proceeds. No loan/credit funds were used for Category 2 as all equipment
purchases were financed by the Government.

Total                                30,000                30,000
Fulfillment of the Main Loan/Credit Covenants
4.04      Compliance with covenants (Table 4) was reasonable, given the major
issues (land acquisition, user charges, deregulation) involved. The land
acquisition problem proved to be extremely difficult to resolve; since it
affects most projects in PNG it seems that a national solution is required.
For this reason, the DWS has established a land acquisition department which
will in future try to acquire land well in advance of construction needs.
Road user charges were gradually increased to an acceptable level and a
trucking deregulation study carried cut. The Government also adhered to
agreements on the road traffic statistical data gathering system.
V. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT
5.01      In addition to assisting the PNG Government in extending its major
highway, the project contributed to the development of all road subsector
organizations. This was particularly beneficial to the Department of Works
and Supply and the Department of Transport. The project also continued the
dialogue on road subsector policies.
Department of Works and Suppl)
5.02      DWS was particularly strengthened by the training of its staff in
both road construction and maintenance during their secondment to various
consultancy teams. Training of staff during construction supervision has
helped DWS to build up its project managed force account capacity and they can
now fully supervise some construction works. The road maintenance technical
assistance component helped the DWS to establish a Road Maintenance Unit (RMU)
and also helped to initiate improvement efforts in maintenance operations,
planning and training. Much still remains to be done in terms of upgrading
actual RMU capability, improving skills and promoting leasE-cost maintenance
techniques.



- 10 -
Department of Transport
5.03      The technical assistance and training provided as part of the rural
transport study has been highly beneficial to the DT. The development of
screening and selection criteria for provincial roads has helped the DT in its
investment planning. This is important because the various provinces put for-
ward many road-building proposals and good screening and selection methodo-
logies are therefore needed. There were also several seminars held for the
training of DT staff wihich were very helpful to institution-building efforts;
now that the DT is on its own the continu&tion of such seminars will be
imperative.
Road Subsector Policies
5.04      With Bank encouragement, the Government has been gradually evolving
policies on road user charges and trucking deregulation, issues which signifi-
cantly affect transport in PNG. The Government is now trying to ensure that
users pay their fair share of road transport costs and also trying to libera-
lize the trucking industry. Progress has been very good as road user charges
were deemed adequate to cover maintenance costs by end-1985 and considerable
progress has been made on de-egulation issues.
VI. ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
6.01      The economic re-evaluation compared the benefits and the costs of
constructing the roads for an estimated 20-year life. The economic costs of
the project include all outlays, net of taxes and duties.  Also included are
the cost differentials of routine maintenance and periodic resurfacirg
required to maintain the standard of the road surface with and without the
road construction or improvement works. Measurable benefits were mainly
reflected in savings in vehicle operating costs (VOC) due to the road
improvements carried out under the project.
Traffic
6.02      For this economic re-evaluation, traffic counts were carried out at
various locations in 1985-86 to determine the actual traffic volumes on each
segment of the road. Annual average daily traffic (AADT) in early 1986 was
found to vary from 531 vpd in the Kainantu-Kassam section to 1,131 vpd in the
Goroka-Henganof;i section of the highway.  The actual traffic growth rates
ranged between 2-6% p.a. during 1979-85, with the lower figure occurring in
the last section completed and opened to traffic (Daulo Pass-Coroka). These
rates were similar to appraisal estimates.
Re-estimated Rates of Return
6.03      Using updated traffic volumes, growth rates and actual construction
costs, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for each section was re-estimated.
Time savings were excluded, future traffic growth rate was set at 5% p.a. and
no further real savings in VOCs were assumed. The ERRs ranged from 11% to 24%



- 11 -
which is reasonably close to appraisal estimates of 14% to 21%. For the
project as a whole, the weighted average was 16.9%, which is less than the
appraisal estimate (18%) but quite satisfactory. The appraisal and ex-post
rates of return are summarized below.
ERR (%)

Project average                          18                 16.9
VII. THE ROLE OF THE BANK
7.01      The project continued and expanded the dialogue between the Govern-
ment and the Bank which was started under previous projects.  This has led to
the further evolution of policies and implementation of programs in the trans-
port sector.  Moreover the various transport studies provided the Government
with a planning framework and led directly to Bank involvement with the secon-
dary road network.
7.02      Significant issues addressed under the project included road user
charges, trucking industry and coastal shipping deregulation, and the promo-
tion of competition in civil aviation. The Bank was instrumental in guiding
the Government's efforts at preparing pricing and other policy proposals, some
of which were successfuly implemented. Road user charges, for example, which
covered only about 50% of maintenance costs at appraisal, are now fully ade-
quate. Similarly user charges for sea transpo.: are now adequate to cover the
cost of maintenance and administration. As for civil aviation and the truck-
ing industry, Bank involvement was pivotal to guiding the Department of Trans-
port in preparation of the present draft transport development strategy which
calls for deregulation of all transport modes. This strategy paper was pre-
sented to the national executive council in November 1985 and has been circu-
lated to all transport organizations, both public and private, for comments
before parliament acts on it. This landmark deregulation policy is consistent
with Bank policies from the inception of its involvement with transport in
PNG.
7.03      Also, in the road subsector, there is now a stronger emphasis on
maintenance, investment planning and the use of local contractors. These are
all measures intended to ensure the development and protection of the road
network at least-cost in PNG. In particular for local contractors, positive



- 12 -
steps are being taken to assist with their development. This includes provid-
ing technical assistance for management improvement and using project-managed
force account for works execution. Under the latter, the DWS carries out some
road construction and maintenance using local contractors who are supervised
by DWS staff. These have all been done with the full support of the Bank.
VII. CONCLUSIONS
8.01      The project was satisfactorily implemented and achieved its main
objective of paving the last major link in the Highlands Highway. PNG has now
therefore completed its major highway, from the coastal city of Lae to
villages such as Mendi, Togoba, etc., which are some 600 km away and in the
previously inaccessible highlands region. Despite delays, continued soil
problems and land acquisition disputes, the civil works were well executed and
the roads had acceptable economic rates of return. The studies, technical
assistance and training have helped significantly to develop road subsector
organizations in PNG and overall, to establish the Department of Transport as
the organization responsible for developing policies for all modes of trans-
port. Finally, the project helped to focus Government's attention on the need
for adequate road maintenance and led to the setting up of the Road Main-
tenance Unit in the Department of Works and Supply. Thus, for the first time,
PNG will have an organization with a separate budget dedicated solely to the
least-cost maintenance of the road network.
