MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO INDIA FOR A
TAMIL NADU WATER RESOURCES CONSOLIDATION PROJECT
1     I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to India for SDR 181.9 million (US$282.9 million equivalent) on standard IDA
terms with a maturity of 3 5 years, to help finance the Tamil Nadu Water Resources Consolidation
Project (WRCP).
2.    Country and Sector Background. Water is an increasingly scarce resource in India. It is
distributed unequally, both spatially and temporally, and in many states, the development of water
resources is reaching physical limits. Irrigation is the largest user of water, accounting for about 93%
of present gross water use. Expansion of irrigation networks has had a major impact on agriculture, a
key sector in India's economy, contributing about 35% of GDP and 65% of employment. By 1990,
coverage of irrigation had increased from 21 million ha in 1950 to 45 million ha, representing a third of
India's cultivated land. The increased volume and reliability of water supplies from irrigation in the
past several decades have made possible the adoption and spread of high yielding crop varieties, the
increased use of fertilizer, and the cultivation of crops outside (in addition to during) the monsoon
season. Irrigated agriculture now contributes over 55% of agricultural output and has been the primary
engine of past agricultural growth. With almost all arable lands already cultivated, irrigation will need
to continue to play an important role in agricultural growth.
3.    Water availability is constrained and available resources must increasingly be allocated for non-
irrigation uses: for urban and rural community needs, industry and power, and incorporating
management to preserve the environment. While still small in consumption relative to agriculture,
growth in these sectors can be expected to be rapid. A recent GOI estimate projects that community
needs would double and industry and power sector requirements would increase sevenfold by 2025.
Effective planning and management of the water sector to account for physical, economic and
environmental needs, are thus critical not just to agriculture but to India's overall economic
development.
4.    Significant improvement in performance and management of irrigation is possible. In most
irrigated commands, sub-optimal water management results in water supply that is unreliable and
distributed inequitably with insufficient or no water in tail-reaches and often excess water for head-end
farmers. Design and construction deficiencies have often contributed to this situation but the more
pervasive problem has been cumulative neglect and inadequate financial contributions to maintenance,
resulting in dilapidated infrastructure. Expenditure priorities need reformulation to emphasize
improvement and upkeep of existing infrastructure. Cost recovery needs improvement in most states.
Farmers also need to be involved in operations and maintenance of irrigation systems. Fundamental to
achieving improved performance is the need for upgrading the institutions involved. State irrigation
departments have become progressively more outdated in both technical and management skills as
sectoral needs, including the need for multi-sectoral water planning, have become increasingly
demanding.

5.    The state of Tamil Nadu, at the southern tip of India has an area of 130,000 km2 and a
population of 56 million of which two-thirds are rural. Population density is high at 428 persons/km2
compared with the national average of 264. Agricultural cultivated area is 5.9 million ha of which 41%
is under irrigation. Principal crops are paddy, millet and sorghum, oilseeds and pulses, with growing
areas under fruits and vegetables, spices, sugarcane and cotton. While annual production of foodgrains
increased from 5.4 million ha in the 1960s to 7.5 million tons in the late 1980s, production since 1970
expanded more slowly than population, and in drought years Tamil Nadu has had to import from other
states. Large urban centers include Madras (3.8 million people), Madurai and Coimbatore (nearly 1
million each). Relative to the rest of India, Tamil Nadu is both land and, in particular, water short. It
has 7% of the country's population but only 4% of the land area and 3% of the country's surface water
resources. Water constraints in Tamil Nadu vary by basin, and are influenced by the extent of
irrigation development and by urban needs. Scarcity is acute in some areas, particularly for Madras
city, for which water is being carried in by train and road. The particular needs of Madras city would
be addressed under the proposed Second Madras Water Supply Project.
6.    Future Strategy. The need to upgrade the productivity of irrigation and the effectiveness of
water planning is increasingly recognized in India, and was discussed in GOI's National Water Policy
formulated in 1987. Following this, and based on a comprehensive review of the sector in India (India
Irrigation Sector Review, Report No. 9518-IN, 1991) conducted jointly with GOI and state
governments, it was determined that achieving improved performance of irrigation would require
actions in four main areas: (a) forging a coherent water resources policy; (b) prioritizing expenditures
and tightening financial management; (c) improving technical performance; and (d) enhancing
institutional capabilities, the role of farmers and the private sector. As part of its preparation for the
WlRCP, GOTN articulated a State Water Policy (SWP) in 1994 supporting the above objectives.
Actions highlighted in the SWP include: establishment of a state institutional apparatus for planning
and allocating water between sectors, including integration of environmental management; improving
the efficiency and productivity of existing water infrastructure; cost recovery based on users paying for
services and periodic adjustment of water rates; and strong emphasis on beneficiary participation
including turning over of maintenance and management of distribution systems to users as the systems
are upgraded.
7.    Rationale for IDA Involvement and Country Assistance Strategy. The project would
implement at the state level the Bank/GOI strategy articulated in the India Irrigation Sector Review.
This strategy is directly supportive of the Bank's new water policy detailed in Water Resources
Management (September, 1993) which proposes an agenda of policies and institutional reforms that
will utilize market forces and strengthen the capacity of governments to carry out their essential roles in
resource use and planning. The project is also representative of the Bank's new lending strategy for
India, as discussed in the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of May 1995. The CAS emphasizes
investment lending operations providing comprehensive support to policy, institutional, and
expenditure reform for key sectors in states receptive to reform. Reforms would be accompanied by
investments in basic infrastructure supporting increased productivity and better management of natural
resources. Better institutional and financial performance in the public sector, complemented by
devolution of responsibilities to stakeholders and the private sector, is also emphasized. Within this
strategy the importance of agricultural development to alleviate poverty is highlighted. In the water
sector, WRCPs would be the main vehicle for Bank support in water development and irrigation
which, in India, are planned and implemented at the state level, thus requiring a state-by-state
approach. The Tamil Nadu WRCP would support the state's new water resources strategy through
funding investments under an agreed state-wide program for the sector, emphasizing the new sector



3
priorities and associated institutional and policy reforms. This would be the second WRCP, following
Haryana WRCP which was approved in FY94. A third WRCP, for Orissa state, has been recently
appraised. Complementing such state-level projects, Bank support would also be selectively provided
at the national level to foster improved performance through actions on a multi-state basis: for
instance, a proposed National Hydrology Project has been appraised and a follow-on project to the
National Water Management Project is under preparation. To implement the new water and irrigation
strategy, for both state-specific WRCP's and national level projects, a close and continuous partnership
between the states and the central Govemment is required. The Bank is one of the few institutions that
can provide the continuity and policy support needed for achieving the long-term strategic goals
articulated in the sector strategy papers above.
8.    Project Objectives. The project's primary objectives would be to: (a) introduce water
resources planning by river basins across all uses of water; (b) improve agricultural productivity
through modemization and completion of irrigation systems, upgraded water management and farmer
participation; (c) assure sustainability of water infrastructure and the environment; and (d) improve
institutional and technical capability for managing the state's water resources. Taking into account
lessons leamt from past Bank projects in the state, the proposed project is designed to meet these
objectives by helping GOTN put in place a comprehensive and sustainable water resources
development program for the state. The state's capacity to implement such a program would be based
on three closely interlocking and interdependent elements: an organizational structure designed and
staffed to address the activities to be taken up in the near and longer term; strengthening of technical
capabilities, including in water planning and environmental management; and, a program and
budgeting process which shapes the schedule of future investments to fit the available funds. The
state's public expenditures in the water resources sector would be re-oriented toward sustaining past
investments, and promoting growth-enhancing investments for the future. These objectives would be
supported by specific investments, related policy reforms and institutional strengthening.
9.    Project Description. The project would be a sector investment loan, financing an agreed
state-wide program to improve productivity and sustainability of Tamil Nadu's irrigation sector, to
introduce multi-sectoral water planning, to integrate farmers in irrigation management, and to
strengthen the state's institutional and technical capability in water development, management and
planning. The project components are as follows: (a) Systems Improvement and Farmer Turnover to
improve productivity through rehabilitation and modernization of the existing irrigation systems
integrated with participation of farmers and turnover of operations and maintenance (O&M) of
improved distributaries, as well as funding of O&M, to water user associations (55 % of project
investment base costs); (b) Scheme Completion Investments to complete viable investment on existing
schemes for increased availability and reliability of water (29% of project investment costs), (c)
capacity building in Water Planning. Environmental Management and Research to introduce multi-
sectoral water planning, incorporate environmental management in all aspects of water planning,
investment and management, and to enhance research in the water sector (8% of project investment
costs); (d) Institutional Strengthening of Tamil Nadu's Water Resources Organization (WRO) to
strengthen capabilities in all professional and management areas (7 % of project investment costs); and
(e) associated Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation for project affected persons (1% of
project investment costs).
10.   Policy Reforms. In preparation for the project, and following on from its 1994 State Water
Policy, GOTN has commenced a rigorous program of policy and institutional reforms: (a) a
fundamental action was the creation of a specialist Water Resources Organization (WRO) from the



4
former construction-oriented irrigation wing of the Public Works Department. WRO will handle state-
wide provision of irrigation and drainage, bulk water supply and flood control and also be responsible
for coordinating state water planning across sectors. Within the new WRO, a staff reorganization is
under way to create streamlined and decentralized management and functionally specialized
management units; (b) a Water Resources Control and Review Council (WRCRC) and supporting
institutional linkages have also been created to handle multi-sectoral water planning and allocation; (c)
priorities for public expenditures have been overhauled, with emphasis now on maintenance and
improved water management rather than on new construction; (d) state financial allocations for
maintenance have been doubled to bring them up to BankAWRO recommended amounts; (e) a
program to involve farmers in irrigation, operations and maintenance has been prepared and
implementation commenced; (f) institutional procedures have been established for annual review of
cost recovery and water charges; (g) WRO's institutional capability for environmental management
has been strengthened and an Environmental Action Plan prepared; and (h) a new structure and
procedures for handling land acquisition and economic rehabilitation (LAER) have been established.
These and other actions in preparation for the project have been formalized through issuance of
relevant Government Orders which have established, prior to project commencement, all institutional
and policy measures required for project implementation.
11.   Program Costs and Financing. The total cost of WRO's program during the project
implementation period is estimated at US$491.0 million, with a foreign exchange component of
US$75.8 million (15%) and taxes and duties estimated at about US$34.4 million. Program costs
comprise the investment costs of the WRCP and WRO's recurrent expenditures. Investment costs
amount to US$315.6 million and cover: investment expenditures on civil works for systems
improvement and scheme completions; and the costs of equipment, facilities, and
training/consultancies, for water planning, research, institutional development, the environmental action
plan, and LAER. WRO's recurrent expenditures comprise the costs of maintenance, staff salaries and
overheads, and would be funded entirely by GOTN. IDA funding would contribute to the project
investment costs of the WRCP and would finance US$282.9 million, representing 58% of program
costs (62% exclusive of estimated taxes and duties) or the equivalent of 100% of the foreign exchange
requirements and 54% of local program costs net of taxes and duties. To reimburse GOTN for
expenditures relating to project start-up, retroactive financing would be applied to all eligible
expenditures incurred from July 1, 1994. Additionally, for completing the remaining (7%) balance
works for the link canal under the former Periyar Vaigai Irrigation II project, the earlier date of
November 1, 1993 would be applied (up to US$1.5 million). The total amount of retroactive financing,
including the link canal, would amount to up to US$11 million or about 4% of the Credit. To expedite
project implementation and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, a special account would be
established in the Reserve Bank of India with an authorized allocation of US$ 10 million, equivalent to
four months estimated average disbursements. A breakdown of program and project investment costs,
and the financing plan, are shown in Schedule A. Procurement and disbursement arrangements are in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No.
13506-IN, dated May 19, 1995, is being distnrbuted separately.
12.   Project Implementation. The proposed project would be carried out by WRO. Overall
responsibility for implementation and coordination of project activities would lie with the Engineer in
Chief, WRO, under guidance of the Secretary, WRO. The Water Resources Control and Review
Council (WRCRC), formed in 1994 and chaired by the Chief Minister, would be the highest state body
for coordinating basin and state water planning and allocation across sectors. WRO's Institute of



5
Water Studies (IWS) would be the Secretariat of the WVRCRC and Nodal Agency for state water
planning. Intensive training and access to international and national consultancies is integrated in all
project activities. For project planning and monitoring, WRO's Program and Budgeting (P&B) unit
would be responsible for developing and maintaining a system of physical and financial reporting to
track project progress, maintain a computerized Management Information System (MIS), and
coordinate preparation of WRO's quarterly reports and its Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget
(ARAPB). The ARAPB would be the primary management tool for planning and supervising the
project. A Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) unit would use P&B and other data (including
consultant surveys as needed) to report on the progress and benefits of the project. Additionally,
GOTN has committed to a strong supervision role itself, and to this effect has established a state
Supervision Committee to be supported by supervision consultants, who would be funded under the
project and would also copy their reports to IDA.
13.   Previous Bank/IDA Experience in Tamil Nadu. The Periyar Vaigai Irrigation I1 Project
(Cr. 1468-IN/SF 16-IN) financed extension and improvement of the old Periyar Vaigai system in
southern Tamil Nadu and closed on October 31, 1993. The Project Completion Report concluded that
the project met its physical objectives and achieved an ERR of 25%. Sustainability was also
considered satisfactory. The project with the greatest relevance to the WRCP is the National Water
Management Project (NWMP, Cr. 1 770-IN), which has enabled the gaining of field experience for the
WRCP's principal component. A study of an NWMP command in Tamil Nadu by the International
Irrigation Management Institute concluded that significant increases in productivity are being achieved.
The momentum built up under Tamil Nadu's component of the NWMP has facilitated preparation of
the WRCP's main component, the systems improvement and farmer turnover program, which has
similar engineering features, and has enabled commencement in the field, of WRCP pre-investment
and farmer organization activities.
14.   Beneficiary Participation. Farmers and other stakeholders are an integral part of the
project's management and implementation arrangements. Based on past experience in Tamil Nadu,
and intensive piloting during project preparation, the project's Systems Improvement and Farmer
Turnover program incorporates farmer organizations in planning, implementation, maintenance, and
cost recovery. At distributary levels prior to investment, Farmer Councils would agree under a
Memorandum of Understanding with WRO to take over responsibility for maintenance, water
management, and associated cost recovery, and would collect an initial deposit from its member
farmers as a demonstration of commitment. These funds would be placed in an interest-earning
Council bank account to capitalize member resources for future maintenance and investment activities.
At whole command levels, Apex Committees comprising representation from all Farmer Councils in
the command, would participate with WRO staff in water management and investment decisions.
Formal turnover of O&M responsibilities to Farmer Councils would be accompanied by intensive
training and would also involve an interim period (about 6-9 months) of "joint management".
15.   Environmental Management. A Sectoral Environmental Assessment (EA) conducted by
WRO and international consultants concluded that the project's investment components were
environmentally beneficial as the resultant improved water management would mitigate against
problems such as waterlogging, salinization, depletion of groundwater levels, and disease risks caused
by sources of stagnant water. The EA did, however, recommend a comprehensive set of actions to
improve WlRO's environmental capability to monitor, plan, develop and manage the state's water
resources. An Environmental Action Plan (EAP), to be funded under the project, incorporates these
recommendations. Under the EAP, supported by funding of associated consultancies, training and



6
equipment: (a) environmental units have been established in IWS and the Project Formulation
Directorate, respectively handling environmental concerns in state water planning and water resources
management, and environmental assessment during preparation of specific sub-projects; (b)
environmental data collection is to be enhanced; (c) a groundwater regulatory unit has been
established; (d) eco-restoration of catchments with depleted vegetative cover will be funded; and, (e)
special studies, monitoring, demonstrations and seminars will be conducted on water related
environmental issues.
16.   Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation. The project's investment components
would involve acquisition of some 570 ha of farmland involving about 1460 project affected persons
(PAPs) in about 710 households. No village residential sites are being relocated, although (statewide)
12 dwellings would be affected. The project includes a Land Acquisition and Economic Rehabilitation
Action Plan (LAERAP) to enable all PAPs to maintain or improve their incomes and welfare on a
sustainable basis. This is based on completed detailed socio-economic surveys and site-specific
LAERAPs that have been undertaken by consultants and WRO, and to be implemented with assistance
of NGOs. In preparation for the project, GOTN has established in consultation with the Bank, a
comprehensive reformulation of its approach to LAER comprising adjusted policies and procedures for
LAER in line with Bank guidelines, to ensure full compensation and restoration of earnings capabilities
of PAPs, together with creation of a new institutional structure for implementation. This would be
through a Special LAER Office headed by a senior government officer, supported by state and district
level Coordination Committees. Project funding would support associated consultancies, training,
equipment, NGO contracts, and incremental staff and operating costs for the new unit. Objectives
under the LAERAP include both fully catering to the specific needs of the PAPs and, more broadly,
creating permanent state-level capability for handling all future LAER needs in Tamil Nadu's water
sector.
17.   Project Sustainability. The project is designed to improve the institutional capabilities of the
state's Water Resources Organization, and to ensure the physical, financial, and environmental
sustainability of its services. As concerns funding of maintenance, GOTN provisions have been at the
levels recommended by WRO and the Bank for the past two financial years, and a detailed assurance
has been provided regarding the continuation of this now satisfactory situation. GOTN financing
requirements for maintenance will also be progressively eased as the lower levels of the irrigation
systems are taken over by farmers. Paralleling the drive to improve the govemment service, emphasis
is placed on fostering stakeholder participation in water planning and management, in particular as
concems farmer participation in investment decisions, operations and maintenance, monitoring of
financial provisions and cost recovery. Over time, stakeholder involvement would foster a demand-
driven and client-oriented govemment service, and progressively increasing implementation by the
non-govemment sector. Emphasis in all project components is placed on creating permanent
institutional capabilities for continued implementation beyond the project period, as in for instance, the
institutional apparatus created for water planning, environmental management, LAER, maintenance,
the systems improvement and farmer tumover program, and the new programming and budgeting
process. NGOs would play a primary role in implementation of the LAERAPs and as extension agents
for the project's farmer participation and turnover component. Through the project's Water Resources
Research Fund supporting research by Tamil Nadu universities and research institutions linked with
foreign or other Indian agencies, Tamil Nadu's water program would be continually enriched with
acquisition of state-of-the-art knowledge. With a restructured and improved water resources agency
and supporting actions from the non-govemmental sector, Tamil Nadu would be better placed to plan
and manage its water resources in response to the state's short, medium and long term needs.

18. Agreed Actions. In a Letter of Development Policy (dated November 1, 1994 and attached to the
Staff Appraisal Report), Tamil Nadu outlined a strategy for the future development of the water
resources sector and provided a statement of policy reforms and actions for improving the management
of water resources in the state. Tamil Nadu confirmed during negotiations its commitment to carry out
such policy reforms. During negotiations, a number of assurances and understandings were obtained:
Assurances. These by and large relate to timely and satisfactory implementation of project
activities, and among others include: (a) Any additional scheme completion investments would be
prepared and evaluated according to agreed criteria, and would be submitted for IDA review and
approval before selection; (b) The LAER component would be implemented in accordance with a plan
agreed with IDA; (c) GOTN would: (i) provide annually, and make available to WRO in a timely
manner during each fiscal year, the funds required for satisfactory maintenance of all WRO's
infrastructure, in order to sustain the infrastructure in full operating order; (ii) provide the maintenance
funds to a separate maintenance works budget exempt from withdrawals for salaries and wages; (iii)
cause WRO to prepare and submit its annual budget estimate for maintenance to GOTN and IDA
based on detailed command-by-command estimates following an agreed reporting, programming and
budgeting, and monitoring and evaluation process; (d) NGOs participating in the project would be
selected according to criteria agreed with IDA; (e) A draft Annual Review, Action Plan and Budget
(ARAPB) for the following fiscal year would be submitted to IDA for review and comment by
December 31 each year. The GOTN-approved ARAPB, taking account of IDA comments, would
subsequently be forwarded to IDA by each March 31, and WRO would subsequently implement the
agreed action plan, including the timely provision of the approved budget funds, in a manner
satisfactory to IDA; (f) GOTN would implement a program satisfactory to IDA for reducing subsidies
provided to TNEB, and TNEB would implement a satisfactory program for improving its cost recovery
and maintaining a sound financial status; (g) By December 31, 1997, GOTN would carry out jointly
vith GOI and IDA, a detailed mid-term project review and thereafter implement its recommendations;
and (h) GOTN's state-level WRCP Supervision Committee would be maintained for the duration of
the project.
Understandings. An understanding was also reached that GOI would release three months
anticipated expenditures in advance to GOTN, and that GOTN would transfer such funds immediately,
together with its quarterly counterpart contributions, to the project accounts of WRO. Additionally,
arrangements, scheduling and procedures were confirmed for: (a) WRO's new institutional structure;
(b) the farmer organization program; (c) the LAER program; (d) the Water Resources Research
Fund; (e) procurement management; (f) technical assistance and training; (g) monitoring and
evaluation; (h) scope and contents of WRO's quarterly and annual reports; and (i) the WRCP's
supervision arrangements including the state Supervision Committee and the supervision consultancy.
19.   Project Benefits. The project would enhance agricultural production on about 0.7 million ha
(50% of the state's surface irrigated area) directly benefitting some 4 million persons, of which 70%
occupy small and marginal farms. Irrigation would be put on a sustainable footing through
rehabilitation and modernization of the systems linked with farmer participation, upgraded
maintenance, water management and cost recovery. A specialist state water agency has been created
and is being strengthened, including the upgrading of technical capabilities in water planning and
environmental management. This would generate broad and long-term benefits essential for Tamil
Nadu's present and long-term economic development and sustainability. Farmer participation and
turnover would forge a private sector role in management of infrastructure and contain organizational
features to foster participation of women and minorities in irrigation's management and benefits. The



8
economic rate of return (ERR) of the project is estimated at 17%, based solely on benefits to be derived
from irrigation investments. This excludes the significant indirect and non-quantifiable benefits that
would stem from the project's institutional strengthening, water planning, and environmental
management activities. Associated measures to create a client-oriented water delivery service and to
re-prioritize the state's expenditure program would result in significant cost savings.
20.   Risks. The fundamental change in water resources management will, first, require continued
political will and sustained effort to be successfully implemented. Key features required (i.e. state
water policy, institutional reorganization, reordering of expenditure priorities, staff training and all key
project-related decisions and Govemment announcements) were established by GOTN during project
preparation. The extensive reforms already implemented provide a strong basis for project start-up and
some confidence regarding the critically important continuation of GOTN's commitment. A variety of
monitoring and incentive mechanisms have also been built into the project to reduce the risk of shortfall
in implementation. Over time, such project measures will be reinforced and significantly overtaken in
importance as the client orientation of the project takes hold and users become important as operators
of irrigation systems and as parties in state and basin water planning.
21.   The second risk relates to the systems improvement and farmer turnover program which,
though based on successful piloting in Tamil Nadu, is innovatory on the scale planned under the
WRCP. The project includes special monitoring and management features and intensive consultancy,
training and NGO assistance. This includes a special review of the farmer turnover program in the
second year of the project, sufficiently early in implementation to make timely adaptations as further
experience is gained. Third, general implementation capacity constraints of WRO have been addressed
in the project's institutional strengthening component, including special arrangements for project
monitoring, reporting, financial management, and supervision. In other respects, Tamil Nadu has
demonstrated the capability and has had successful experience im undertaking the kind of physical
activities to be implemented under the project.
22.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
