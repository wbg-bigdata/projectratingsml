THIRD WINDOW
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
UNITED REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
FOR A THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the United Republic of Cameroon, for the equivalent of US$17.0 million
to help finance the T'hird Education Project. The loan would be made on Third
Window terms of twent:y-five years, including a seven-year grace period, with
interest at 4-1/2 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The report, "The Recent Economic Development of Cameroon"(No. 72-
247), was distributed to the Executive Directors on November 27, 1972. A
special economic mission visited the country in February and November 1975,
to review the GovernTaent's investment plan for FY1977-1981 and its conclu-
sions are reflected in the following analysis.
Economic Potential
3.        Cameroon's natural resources are varied, but not always easily
accessible. Soils and climatic conditions permit cultivation of a wider
range of crops than [s commonly found in West Africa. The forest areas of
the southeast contain large untapped timber resources, and the north holds
promising potential Eor livestock development.
4.        While the inain opportunities for development lie in the expansion
of agricultural production, Cameroon also has potential for expanding pro-
duction of import substitutes needed for a growing domestic market, and the
processing for export of alumina and agricultural and forestry products. A
bauxite project is in the early stages of preparation, while offshore oil and
gas exploration has so far yielded only modest results.
5.        Commerce, transportation and transit services are important economic
activities: Cameroon is a relatively large country with its main economic
centers separated by vast underpopulated areas, and the country serves as a
main export route for landlocked Chad. As a result, large investments in port
and inland transport infrastructure are prerequisites to promoting agriculture,
forestry and industry, and strengthening Cameroon's role as a regional trade
center.

the Small- and Medium-Scale Enterprise Project, dated June 16, 1975.

-2-
Past Performance
6.        During the first decade of independence (1960-1970), the Govern-
ment's primary objective was to unify the nation and to ease serious internal
political and social tensions. GDP at constant prices grew at a satisfactory
rate of nearly 7 percent a year. Cash crop production rose steadily due to
good export prices and favorable weather conditions, and manufacturing pro-
duction increased as a result of the liberal investment climate that attracted
substantial foreign private capital.
7.        During the 1960s gross total investment averaged about US$200 mil-
lion annually (in constant 1974 dollars), i.e. 14 percent of GDP. Public in-
vestment accounted for about 57 percent of total investment with the largest
part devoted to the transportation network, the most immediate development
constraint, while substantial effort was also directed at expanding education
and diversifying agriculture. Significant increases In fiscal revenues, com-
bined with stringent expenditure controls, produced sizeable budget surpluses
that made it possible to finance a large part (up to 40 percent) of public
investments out of local revenues as well as to accumulate reserves. How-
ever, this policy also imposed excessive restraint on much needed current
expenditure in such areas as road maintenance, public health, and education.
8.        In the early 1970s, economic growth slowed down to less than 3 per-
cent p.a. or little more than population growth. This was mainly caused by
(i) low export prices for cocoa and coffee during 1971-72 and a drought in
the north, and (ii) a decline in private investment induced by the rela-
tive stagnation of the agricultural sector and by the completion of the most
obvious import substitution projects during the preceding decade.
9.        The Government reacted to these developments by stepping up public
investment, whose volume increased by 50 percent to reach annual averages
of about US$180 million in constant 1974 dollars during the Third Develop-
ment Plan (FY72-76), and resulted in a substantial drawdown of Treasury
reserves and a major increase in foreign borrowing. Fortunately, the avail-
ability of well-prepared, high priority projects enabled Cameroon to obtain
most of the increased inflow of foreign capital from public aid donors on
concessionary terms. For this reason, as well as the country's low foreign
debt before the 1970s, Cameroon's external debt service has remained modest
(about 4 percent of export earnings in 1974).
10.       During the 1970-1974 period, low economic growth had significantly
reduced import demand, while exports maintained a remarkable growth and pro-
fited from higher prices in 1974. Therefore, the balance of payments was not
under excessive pressure and the large inflow of foreign capital remained
sufficient to cover the current account deficit. However, the situation
worsened in 1974/75; the combined effect of a 50 percent increase in import
prices with a 45 percent decline in timber exports (mainly due to depressed
construction activity in Europe), resulted in a high trade deficit and a sharp
decline in foreign exchange reserves during the first half of 1975, announc-
ing an era of more severe balance of payments problems.



- 3-
Prospects and Development Strategy
11.       As a resuli: of the current and projected deterioration of
Cameroon's terms of i-rade, exports will play a less dynamic role in econo-
mic expansion, while domestic demand is still too small to take up the
slack. Therefore, overall growth in the next decade might run well below
the rates achieved during the 1960s, in spite of Government efforts to
maintain a high volume of public investment and to develop the country's
considerable opportunity for diversification, particularly within the
rural sector.
12.       Steady economic growth will depend largely on the extent to which
the Government comes to grips with several structural problems: (i) rural
production (except forestry) suffers from a lack of financial and technical
assistance particularly for small farmers, who produce nearly 90 percent of
the country's agricultural output; (ii) despite heavy investment in recent
years, the basic transport infrastructure is still insufficient; the Douala
port and the Douala-Yaounde corridor (the main transport route) require
increases in capacity and the road system in general needs better main-
tenance as well as adaptation to traffic growth especially for the develop-
ment of new agricultural and forestry zones; (iii) the education system
still is not responding adequately to the country's changing needs; and
(iv) serious economic imbalances persist among regions, between the towns
and countryside, and between modern and traditional sectors.
13.       To meet these challenges, the Government must strengthen its
ability to choose, prepare, and implement projects, particularly in the
rural sector. Progress is being made in this direction. Special planning
units are gradually being established within the technical ministries. A
para-public consulting firm - SEDA - was created under the Planning Ministry
to accelerate project preparation. Commercially oriented pubLic corpora-
tions are also serving to strengthen the project implementation capacity
of the public sector. Nevertheless, further improvements are needed, par-
ticularly in the management of public finance, and in strengthening and
coordinating rural development institutions.
14.       Completing the overall transport infrastructure program already
underway will absorb a high proportion of future public investment.    If the
Government succeeds in its present efforts to accelerate preparation and
implementation of projects in the other sectors, particularly for rural
development, future total public investment is likely to exceed US$270 mil-
lion annually (in constant 1974 dollars) during the Fourth Development Plan
(FY77-81). Budgetary revenues already reach 20 percent of GDP, and cannot
be expected to increase much faster than the economy as a whole, while
surpluses of the stabilization funds are likely to stagnate or even decline
considering the depressed price outlook for most export crops.    Current
expenditures, on the contrary, will expand as a result of recent increases in
public investments -n transport, education, and health, as will public debt



service charges. Furthermore, savings of public enterprises are expected to
decline since debt service will absorb a higher share of their operating
surpluses. As a consequence, in the next five years, public savings after
debt service will probably not exceed 25-30 percent of public investment, as
compared with about 40 percent over the past few years. Hence Cameroon will
have to rely on external financing for the bulk of its public investment, and
on average, foreign lenders should be prepared to finance more than two-thirds
of total project costs. Particularly for rural development projects this
would imply some local cost financing.
15.       Increasing reliance on foreign borrowing will require careful for-
eign debt management during a period of relatively slow economic growth and
poorer terms of trade. If, however, borrowing on conventional terms does not
exceed 50 percent of foreign public capital inflow, the foreign debt service
ratio could be maintained around 10 percent by the early eighties. Cameroon's
ability to make effective use of external resources and the Government's
dedication to development are reasons for increased external support. To
avoid further rapid buildup of debt service, lenders, including the Bank
Group, should provide a substantial part of their assistance on concessionary
terms. Taking these factors as well as the country's relative poverty into
account, Cameroon is considered eligible for Third Window loans. The proposed
Third Education Project would be the first Third Window operation in Cameroon.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN CAMEROON
16.       The Bank Group's commitments in Cameroon now amount to US$200.7
million and cover fifteen projects: six in agriculture, five in transporta-
tion, two in education, one in public utilities and one small- and medium-
scale enterprise project. Transportation represents the largest share (53
percent) of our past commitments followed by agriculture (33 percent).
Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of
February 29, 1976, and includes notes on ongoing projects. Although delays
and setbacks have been occasionally encountered in the execution of projects,
the Government has consistently shown willingness to collaborate with the
Bank in seeking and applying satisfactory solutions.
17.       For the future, the Bank Group's strategy is to support the Gov-
ernment in its efforts to create productive employment in rural and urban
areas, to upgrade and improve operation and maintenance of the country's
infrastructure, to stimulate investment by local entrepreneurs, and to
increase the efficiency of Cameroon's institutions.
18.       In agriculture, we have been able to help the Government further
diversify production by financing its oil palm and rubber plantations in
the east and west, and rice irrigation and livestock in the north. The
cocoa project approved in September 1974 will modernize cocoa growing by
smallholders and raise rural productivity in an area south and west of the
capital. The rubber project approved in June 1975 would develop the south-
west coastal region.    Identification work for rural development projects in



populated but poor regions, mainly the north and the western highlands, is
underway. Besides promoting much needed foodstuff production, increased
Bank Group lending to agriculture will support the Government's effort to
organize itself and focus on rural development in order to correct geograph-
ical and economic imbalances in Cameroon's development.
19.       Recognizing the crucial importance of transportation to economic
growth in Cameroon and in neighboring countries, the Government has devoted
the largest portion of public investments to this sector. The Bank Group
together with bilateral institutions, has substantially helped Government
develop adequate transport facilities. The second highway project of 1973
will help bring the establishment of the basic trunk road system near comple-
tion.  The second railway project of 1974 has focussed on some improvements
to the tracks and on the equipment needed to maintain and augment the railway's
overall carrying capacity. Given sharp traffic increases and the backlog of
required investments, massive injections of capital will still be necessary
in the years ahead, particularly for the expansion of the port of Douala
and some major related facilities such as the rail station and marshalling
Yard to be built outside the port area. A proposed Bank loan will help
complete the engineering of this station and marshalling yard. [mprovement
of the Douala - Yaounde transport corridor will also require substantial
investments. A second Douala port project was appraised in mid-1975 and
is scheduled to be presented to the Executive Directors in early FY 77.
Future road investment will mainly be for road maintenance and feeder roads
to provide links to local markets and facilitate exploitation of Cameroon's
forests, a major area for future development. In other sectors, the small-
and medium-scale enterprises project approved in 1975 will mainly help develop
local entrepreneurship.
20.       In all our projects, we will as in the past include training, tech-
nical assistance, and c,ther provisions necessary for strengthening institu-
tions and improving sector policies. In addition, through our economic work
we will continue to advise the authorities, at their request, on development
questions in general, 2nd on particular matters such as economic management,
problems of urban migration and manpower development.
21.       Our lending to Cameroon has been closely coordinated with other
donors; in ten of our fifteen projects, joint or parallel co-financing arrange-
ments have been made.
22.       Over the second half of the last decade disbursements of foreign
aid amounted to about US$40-45 million a year. While at the beginning of
this period 65 percent of aid funds were grants, the proportion of loans has
been slowly increasing. A major part of external assistance was provided by
France and concentrated in infrastructure and productive sectors. The aid
giving agencies of the EEC (European Development Fund and European Investment
Bank) directed their lending mainly to agriculture, with infrastructure in
second place. Bank Grcup disbursements were small during this period. From
1972 to 1974 disbursements of foreign aid increased to about US$60 million
with one third as grant:s. The Bank Group's share of these inflows amounted
to about 25 percent. E'ublic debt outstanding and disbursed as of December 31,



- 6 -
1974 amounted to US$280 million and is projected to reach US$1,300 million
in 1980. Public debt service as a proportion of export earnings amounted
to about 4.0 percent in 1974 and is projected to reach 10 percent in 1981.
At that time disbursements may be over US$250 million with only 15 percent
in grants. At present Bank debt outstanding and disbursed amounts to nearly
11 percent of all public debt and 10 percent of public debt service. IDA
credits outstanding and disbursed amount to nearly 13 percent of public debt
outstanding and 0.9 percent of public debt service. Bank Group lending is
expected to account for nearly 12.5 percent of public debt service in 1980.
23.       In October 1974, Cameroon became IFC's 100th member and, in a
first operation approved on May 22, 1975, the Corporation will invest in
the equity of Bata - a foreign owned shoe complex - and assist in the sale
of its shares to local private investors.
PART III - EDUCATION IN CAMEROON
Government Policies
24.       Since independence, the Government has concentrated on increasing
enrollments in primary education (from about 680,000 students in 1964 to
970,000 in 1972) and in general secondary education (from 25,600 to 73,000
in the same period). Nevertheless, educational opportunities remain re-
stricted and unequally distributed, particularly at the primary level. A
simultaneous objective has been to train the technicians and skilled workers
needed to replace expatriates and to cater for the growing demands of local
industry. The Government's education policies increasingly take account of
the training requirements of agricultural and rural communities. A major
concern is the high rate of unemployment among school graduates that has
been exacerbated by the migration of school leavers from rural to urban
areas.
25.       Major objectives of the Government's Third Plan are the achieve-
ment of balanced regional and sectoral development in an effort to improve
rural living conditions. Investments in rural areas are increasing, par-
ticularly in Northern Cameroon, an area lacking infrastructure and ser-
vices. As a result, Cameroon will require more and better trained man-
power to serve in rural areas. The Government also intends to improve
secondary level education and to expand technical and higher education.
In response to the Government's investment priorities and in an effort to
assist the Government bring education and training in line with expected
manpower needs, the proposed Third Education Project includes technical
education and rural health training components and a major program to
expand and improve agricultural education.
Administration of Education
26.       The Ministry of National Education (MOE), as the government agency
primarily concerned with education, is responsible for all levels of general



- 7 -
and technical education and for all higher education. Other Ministries,
principally Agriculture, Health, Livestock and Telecommunications, are
also involved in educatLon and training but mostly at the secondary level
in fields related to their activities. This division of responsibility
calls for close cooperation in educational planning and management; the
need for such cooperation is evident in agricultural education, on which
the proposed project places its emphasis (para. 36 of this report).
27.       The Government plans to upgrade and expand its agricultural ex-
tension services, which are the responsibility of one of the services of
the Directorate of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Ministry of
Agriculture. It has or will allocate in each province a "Poste Agricole",
which is responsible for assisting farmers by disseminating information
about improved agricultural practices. The Government plans to strengthen
these units by improving the qualifications of extension agents, increasing
their number and delegaiting more responsibility for development schemes to
field staff. Concurrently, the Government plans to strengthen the Ministry
of Livestock by increasing the number of its animal health and production
agents. Furthermore, the Ministry of Health has initiated an innovative
program to improve ruraL health conditions by reducing the incidence of
endemic diseases, through the integration of preventive and curative health
care in eleven demonstration zones.
28.       These programs are already placing heavy demands on the small
and inadequately trained staffs of the Ministries of Agriculture and Live-
stock. Moreover, extension work is expected to become more demanding in
the future as it shifts from that of a single-crop farming advisory service
to providing comprehensLve mixed farming services, covering cash and food
crops as well as livestock production. This increased sophistication calls
for upgrading the extension service's present staff and improving training
for new staff.
Education Costs
29.       Greater emphasis on agricultural education and training, on the
expansion of technical and higher education, as well as on the improvement
of general secondary education and of primary education in rural areas,
will have to be effected through increased efficiency in existing systems
and reallocation of resources, since the already high allocations to educa-
tion cannot be increased appreciably. In 1971/72 total education expendi-
tures amounted to CFAF 19.3 billion (US$85.8 million), or 5.9 percent of
GNP; the Government's share (including its subsidies to private teaching
institutions) amounted to CFAF 11.8 billion (US$52.4 million), or about 20
percent of its total expenditures. Total current expenditures were mostly
for general education (;2 percent), the University of Yaounde (18 percent)
and technical education (7 percent). Agricultural education accounted for
only 2 percent of the total.
30.       The unit cost of primary education in Cameroon (CFAF 6,000 or
US$27) is low relative to that in other West African countries. The scope
for improvements in efficiency is less in primary education than in second-
ary and higher educatioa, and the measures for expanding and improving it



- 8 -
will lead to higher unit and total costs. The unit costs of secondary
education (CFAF 38,000 or US$169) and of higher education (CFAF 500,000 or
US$2,200), however, are high and could be reduced through such measures as
reducing repeater and dropout rates.    The Government will need to allocate
a larger share of education resources for vocational and professional educa-
tion and training than it has in the past, if education and training are to
be brought in line with expected manpower needs.
Technical Education
31.       The main characteristics of technical education in the early years
following independence were its inability to meet the country's need for
trained manpower, the low quality of training, and the structural differences
caused by the different education systems that were inherited at independence
in East and West Cameroon. Starting in the late 1960's, the Government's
effort to resolve some of the problems of technical education was assisted
by IDA's First and Second Education Projects. This effort, which is not
completed yet, emphasizes the reform and adaptation of technical education
curricula, the improvement and expansion of several existing institutions
for training skilled workers and technicians, and the construction of new
technical schools.
32.       A major issue for this subsector is the lack of a development plan
establishing training targets and standards based on an assessment of the
country's needs. The Ministry of Education (MOE) has at its disposal the
necessary resources to undertake this task which should be accorded high
priority as an objective to be pursued in future educational development.
Until such a plan is developed, new investments can be evaluated best
against well-defined local needs. North Cameroon is a case in point. This
region's economy will be growing faster with the opening of the railway to
Ngaoundere, and the demand for technicians and skilled workers is expected
to increase. The ongoing Second Education Project is assisting in meeting
this region's need for technicians through the construction of a technical
lycee at Garoua, and the proposed Third Education Project would assist it
by financing a school at Ngaoundere to train skilled workers. This region
has a cumulative shortfall of about 300 skilled workers, mainly in mech-
anical maintenance, diesel mechanics, metalwork and electronics, and by
1980 it will require about 75 skilled workers annually.
Rural Health Training
33.       The training of physicians, nurses and other health technicians
is conducted in Cameroon at the "Centre Universitaire des Sciences de la
Sante" (CUSS), one of the faculties of the University of Yaounde. CUSS's
approach to medical and paramedical training has been very innovative
when compared to the rest of West Africa, and particularly appropriate to
health conditions in Cameroon. The main innovative aspects are: (a) chang-
ing health education from a largely urban orientation and placing greater
emphasis upon the health problems of the rural population; (b) balancing
the roles of curative and preventive health care by paying greater attention
to the preventive aspects of health training; and (c) emphasizing the need



- 9 -
of health personnel to work as merbers of an inter-disciplinary team rather
than as individuals.
Agricultural Education
34.       The present system of agricultural education comprises the follow-
ing:
(a)  a university program at the "Ecole Nationale Superieure
Agronomique" (ENSA) with an enrollment of 56 students
and 33 teachers, at a cost per student/year of CFAF 2.5 mil-
lion (about: US$11,000);
(b)  two National Colleges of Agriculture (Dschang and Bambili)
with an enrollment of 120 in the technician program and
15 teachers,at a cost per student/year of about CFAF 0.5
million (US$2,200);
(c) four lower secondary agricultural schools (Maroua, Ebolowa,
Bafang and Abong-Mbang) with an enrollment of 60 and 31
teachers, at a cost per student/year ranging from CFAF 0.7
million to 0.8 million (US$3,100 - 3,600); and
(d)  two veterinary training centers (Maroua and Jakiri) with an
enrollment of 40 in the assistant veterinarian and 5 in the
technician program and 7 teachers, at a cost per student/
year ranging from CFAF 0.5 million to 0.7 million (US$2,200-
3,100).
35.       The system suffers from four major problems:
(a) the lack oE up-to-date training facilities and equipment;
(b) poor planning and management;
(c) a shortage of qualified agricultural teachers; and
(d) inappropriate curricula.
The very high unit costs of these training institutions are attributable
to: the wide dispersion of the schools; student/teacher ratios that are
far lower than those of similar institutions in other countries; generous
student allowances; and an unnecessarily large number of daily workers on
the school farms.
36.       Planning and management problems are aggravated by the divided
responsibilities for agricultural education. The 14OE through ENSA is re-
sponsible for university-level agricultural education, the "Direction des
Programmes et Etudes"' of the Ministry of Livestock (MOL) is retsponsible for
carrying out secondary-level livestock education, and the Ministry of Agri-
culture (MOA) for secondary agricultural education. However, the responsi-
bilities of MOL and MOA are limited to the operational administration of



- 10 -
the institutions concerned and do not include curriculum development and
diploma and certificate awards, tasks which have been given to the Division
of Rural Pedagogy of ENSA's Department of Agricultural Education and to MOE
respectively. For the purpose of establishing targets, standards and policies
for the higher technician training program and for the lower and upper sec-
ondary agricultural schools, the Government has agreed to establish by
December 31, 1976, a National Committee for Agricultural and Rural Education
(section 3.07 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
37.       The shortage of qualified teachers for the training schools is a
major weakness of agricultural education in Cameroon. A permanent system
for training agricultural teachers has not yet been established, nor are
the conditions of work conducive to attracting the best candidates for this
field. Most of the practicing teachers have had no formal pedagogical train-
ing other than short in-service seminars. There is a need, therefore, to
establish at ENSA an agricultural teacher training course leading to a teach-
ing certificate for students recruited from among the staff of the Ministries
and other agencies involved in agriculture, who are qualified and who have
had several years of field experience.
38.       The problem of inappropriate curricula for existing agricultural
schools cannot be resolved until ENSA establishes a formal curriculum dev-
elopment process and expands the limited efforts of its Division of Rural
Pedagogy to develop agricultural education curricula adapted to conditions
in Cameroon. This Division has substantially completed the revisions and
reform of the curricula for the lower secondary agricultural schools, and
is planning to do so for the upper secondary agricultural schools and to
develop new curricula for the higher agricultural technician training program.
The main needs are for (i) emphasis on field work through the "learn-by-doing"
methods; (ii) greater coordination in agricultural and livestock education;
(iii) integration of the different levels of training -- lower secondary,
middle-level technician and new higher technician; and (iv) use of the agricul-
tural training institutions as rural development and demonstration centers for
the regions in which they are located. Funds provided under the proposed
Third Education project would assist the MOA to improve agricultural educa-
tion planning and teaching methods in schools below the university level.
39.       The inadequacies of the present agricultural education system
will become more acute as the MOA implements its plan to improve the ratio
between extension agents and farm families from the present level of about
1,500 families per agent to 500 per agent in 1990. Demands generated by
this plan, plus the needs of other government agencies to 1990, are shown
below:



Agriculture      Livestock
University graduates                 370             75
Higher technicians                   550            135
Middle-level technicians           2,300            435
Extension agents                   2,400            360
Allowing for attrition of present staff, the required average annual output of
extension agents over the period 1975-1990 is estimated as follows:
Agriculture      Livestock
University graduates                 25              5
Higher technicians                   40            10
Middle-level technicians            150             30
Extension agents                    160            25
This output will be provided by the proposed project and through other invest-
ments planned by Government.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
40.       IDA has assisted the development of education in Cameroon through
two projects. The First Education Project (Credit 161-CM, signed in September
1969) provided US$10.5 million, mainly for expanding and improving primary
and secondary teacher training and general secondary education. After some
delays in the early stages of its execution, the project is now nearing
completion and most of the institutions have admitted students for their first
courses. In 1975 IDA provided supplementary financing (US$1.2 milion) for
this project to cover a cost overrun caused by the US dollar devaluation.
The main thrust of the US$9 million Second Education Project (Credit 320-CM,
signed in June 1972) is on investments and curriculum reform for technical
education. Its implementation was delayed by about two years because of hold-
ups in selecting architects and agreeing on designs, but is now proceeding
satisfactorily. This project has, however encountered cost overruns of about
60 percent (US$7.2 million), attributable to the US dollar devaLuation (US$2.2
million) and a higher rate of price increase (48 percent) than was foreseen
at appraisal (20 percent), the impact of which has been compounded by the im-
plementation delays. As a consequence, the lower secondary technical school
in Douala cannot be financed under this project and is therefore proposed for
financing as part of the proposed project.

41.       The proposed Third Education Project is based upon pre-investment
studies financed under the Second Education Project. Project identification
was undertaken by IDA with the assistance of FAO. Project preparation was
completed in November 1974, and appraisal was undertaken by a Bank mission
in February/March 1975. Negotiations for a Third Window loan were held in
Washington from February 24 to March 2, 1976, with a Cameroonian delegation
headed by Mr. Eric Dikoko Quan, Charge d'Affaires, a.i., of the Embassy of
the United Republic of Cameroon in Washington.
Proposed Third Education Project
42.       The proposed project would be implemented over the five year
period 1976-1980 and would comprise:
(a) Construction, equipment and furniture for:
(i) a lower secondary technical school (College
d'Enseignement Technique) in Douala, including
a training section for lower secondary workshop
teachers; and
(ii) a lower secondary technical school (College
d'Enseignement Technique) in Ngaoundere;
technical assistance for a deputy director
would also be provided for this item;
(b) Technical Assistance (11.5 man-years of specialist
services) to strengthen the MOA's capacity to develop
programs of agricultural education and to supervise their
implementation. The MOA would manage all schools for
agricultural education and other related fields below the
university level.
(c) Construction, equipment and furniture for administrative,
academic and dormitory buildings and staff housing, and
technical assistance for:
(i) expanding and improving two existing lower secondary
agricultural schools at Ebolowa and Maroua
and establishing a lower secondary agricultural school
at Bambili;
(ii) expanding and improving the regional upper
secondary agricultural school at Bambili;
and establishing two regional upper secondary
agricultural schools at Ebolowa and Maroua (all
such schools to be located on the same sites as
those of the schools referred to in (c) (i)
above); and



- 13 -
(iii) establishing the Institute for the Training of Higher
Technicians in Agriculture and Livestock (Institut des
Techniques Agricoles) on the ENSA campus at Nkolbisson
for training higher technicians in agriculture and live-
stock, including the development of a 25-hectare farm
and three field stations at sites acceptable to the
Government and the Bank.
(d) Construction, equipment and furniture for three rural clinics,
with dormitory facilities for the medical teams of the
University Center for Health Sciences (Centre Universitaire
des Sciences de la Sante - CUSS), in the regions of Bambili,
Batouri and Ngaoundere, for improving the rural health train-
ing program cf CUSS.
(e) Technical assistance for:
(i) pre-investment studies and preliminary design work
for a further education project; and
(ii) project implementation - a procurement specialist,
an arch:itect and a civil engineer.
Purposes
43.       The proposed Third Education Project would assist the Government in
continuing its efforts to develop the country's technical education system
and in achieving the objectives of the Second Education Project financed by
IDA. Specifically, the project would assist technical education by: financ-
ing the lower secondary technical school in Douala originally included in the
Second Education Project; improving technical education planning; and financ-
ing a new lower secondary technical school at Ngaoundere to train skilled
workers. To ensure that the formal technical training system will be res-
ponsive to the actual needs of local industry and business, a Governing
Board will be established for each of the two lower secondary technical
schools in Douala and Ngaoundere.
44.       Through appropriately designed programs in new or expanded institu-
tions and through improvement in student/teacher ratios, the proposed project
would also make agricultural and health education a more effective and cost
efficient tool for agricultural and rural development. These programs would
supply the qualified manpower that would introduce improved agricultural
methods and would help to change attitudes towards agriculture. Specifically,
the project would assist in:
(a) improving the management of agricultural and rural education
through measures to strengthen the MOA's current capacity
in agricultural education planning, teaching methods and media
resources for agricultural education and extension services,
thus also laying the basis for a rural information system;



- 14 -
(b) upgrading extension services by increasing the number of
trained agents and improving the training of extension
personnel at all levels;
(c) supporting rural health training;
(d) regionalizing agricultural training to cater for the varied
agri-ecological regions in Cameroon;
(e) filling a gap in the agricultural manpower structure by
starting a new program for training higher technicians within
the ENSA campus, but with budgetary and administrative autonomy
(Section 3.08 (a) and (b) of the draft Loan Agreement); and
(f) integrating livestock and agricultural training at the higher
technician level.
Project Execution
45.       The MOE would be responsible for supervising the execution of the
lower secondary technical schools, the rural health training program of CUSS,
and the pre-investment studies. The MOA would be responsible for the tech-
nical assistance to that ministry, the lower and upper secondary agricul-
tural schools, and for the institute for the training of higher technicians
in agriculture and livestock. Targets, standards and policies for the
higher agricultural technician training program and the lower and upper
secondary agricultural schools would be established by the proposed National
Committee for Agricultural and Rural Education (para. 36 of this report).
The day-to-day supervision of construction, procurement and loan administra-
tion of the proposed Third Education Project would be the responsibility of
the Project Unit established in the MOE for the First and Second Education
Projects. In addition to the technical assistance for project implementation
proposed in the loan, this Unit would be supported by designated representa-
tives from each of the Ministries concerned with the project. The staff
member designatd by the MOA would be on a full-time basis. The Director of
the Project Unit would be responsible for (a) coordination with the Government
Ministries and Agencies involved, (b) supervision of project implementation,
and (c) liaison with the Bank (Section 3.01 (b) of the draft Loan Agreement).
Procedures for the selection of consulting architects for project design are
well advanced. However, to reduce the risk of long delays in project imple-
mentation similar to those that occurred in the Second Education project
(para. 40), the signing of a contract for project design between the Govern-
ment and the architects, including a timetable acceptable to the Bank, would
be made a condition of loan effectiveness (Section 5.01 b) of the Loan Agree-
ment).
Project Costs and Financing Arrangements
46.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes and customs duties, is
estimated at about CFAF 5.6 billion, or US$24.9 million, with a foreign
exchange component of US$17.0 million equivalent, or about 68 percent of
the total. Taxes and customs duties are estimated at CFAF 1.3 billion or



- 15 -
US$5.7 million. The cost estimates are based on recent work undertaken by
both the public and private sectors, including a detailed analysis of the
actual costs of the First Education Project and the bid results for some of
the institutions of the Second Education Project. The project cost includes
an allowance of 10 percent for physical contingencies for all categories of
expenditure. The allowance for both local and foreign price escalation is
calculated on the project's estimated base cost as of March 30, 1976, and
amounts to about 31 percent of the base cost estimate plus physical contin-
gencies. Unit costs for selected project components compare favorably
with those in neighboring countries. Site development has been estimated
at about 10 percent of the cost of civil works, and furniture between 4
percent and 14 percent, depending upon the type of institution and facil-
ity. The distribution of costs by category is as follows: civiL works,
49 percent; furniture, 3 percent; equipment, 23 percent; consulting archi-
tects, 3 percent; and other professional services, 22 percent.
Retroactive Financing
47.       Retroactive financing in the amount of US$300,000 is recommended
to cover: (a) the Bank's share of the cost of expenditures prior to Loan
signature on the lower secondary technical school in Douala (up to a maximum
of US$250,000);and (b) the cost of the services of the consulting architects
who would be working oni the sketch drawings for the project institutions (up
to a maximum of US$50,000).
Procurement and Disbursements
48.       Contracts for building works (US$12.1 million), furniture (US$0.7
million) and equipment (US$5.8 million) would be awarded following inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. The
building works are witnin the capacity of Cameroon's construction industry.
Local contractors would be given a domestic preference of 7-1/2 percent in
bid evaluation. Contracts for furniture and equipment would be let in pack-
ages of at least US$20,000. Furniture and equipment manufactured in Cameroon
and in countries which are a party to the Union Douaniere et Economique
de l'Afrique Centrale (UDEAC) would be allowed a preference equal to the lower
of a) 15 percent of the c.i.f. price on imported goods, or b) the prevailing
duties generally applied to non-exempt imports. Farm animals, small agricul-
tural implements, and other equipment, which are not suitable for competitive
bidding or cannot be grouped in packages of at least US$20,000 equivalent,
would be procured locally on the basis of quotations and accordLng to local
procedures acceptable to the Bank. The total of all such purchases should not
exceed US$300,000 over the duration of the project.
49.       The funds from the Loan Account would be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100 percent of the foreign expenditures (c.i.f. costs)
for imported equipment, or 75 percent if this is pur-
chased locally;



- 16 -
(b)  100 percent of the foreign expenditures (c.i.f. costs)
for imported furniture, or 75 percent if this is pur-
chased locally;
(c) 60 percent of the total expenditures for architectural
consultants;
(d) 75 percent of total expenditures for technical assistance
and fellowships; and
(e) 57 percent of the costs, representing the foreign exchange
component, of civil works.
Disbursements would be made against contracts or certificates of expenditure;
documentation for the latter would not be submitted for review, but would be
retained by the Government and would be available for inspection by the Bank
during the course of project supervision. Any funds remaining undisbursed at
the completion of the project would be cancelled. Construction is expected to
be completed in about three years after the signing of the Loan Agreement.
Recurrent Costs of the Project
50.        In 1982, the first year when all the project schools become fully
operational, the total recurrent costs, which would be met by the Government,
would amount to an additional CFAF 380 million (US$1.7 million). The increase
in the budget of the MOA would account for CFAF 145 million (US$0.6 million)
of this total and that of the MOE for CFAF 235 million (US$1.1 million).
There would also be annual increases in the budget of the MOA for hiring the
graduates of the project schools. The increase is estimated (at 1974/75
prices and salary scales) to be about CFAF 115 million (USS$0.5 million) annual-
ly for the MOA. This is not expected to impose an undue burden on Government
finances.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMIENTS AND AUTHORITY
51.       The draft Loan Agreement between the United Republic of Cameroon
and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III Section
4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a draft resolution ap-
proving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
52.        Special conditions of loan effectiveness (Section 5.01 of the draft
Loan Agreement) would be:
(a)  the expansion of the Project Unit responsible for supervising
the execution of the First and Second Education Projects to
enable it to supervise the implementation of the proposed proj-
ect, and the assignment to it of staff and responsibilities
acceptable to the Bank;



- 17 -
(b) the signing of a contract between the Government and the
consulting architects, including a timetable acceptable to
the Bank, for undertaking project design.
53.       Conditions of disbursement for specific project components include:
(para. 4 (b), (c), (d) and (e) of Schedule 1 of the draft Loan Agreement):
(a) the establishment of a Governing Board for the two lower
secondary technical schools in Douala and Ngaoundere;
the definition of the Governing Boards' responsibilities,
powers and composition shall be satisfactory to the Gov-
ernment and the Bank (para. 43 of this report);
(b) the implementation of measures, satisfactory to the Bank,
to strengthen the MOA's capacity to develop and carry out
programs of agricultural education (para. 44 (a) of this
report);
(c) the establishment within ENSA of the Institute for the
Training of Higher Technicians in Agriculture and Live-
stock (Institut des Techniques Agricoles) under terms
and conditions acceptable to the Bank and the issuance
of regulations that give the Institute budgetary and
administrative autonomy (para 44 (e) of this report);
(d)  agreement between the Government and the Bank on the terms
of reference for the pre-investment studies (para. 42 (e) i
of this report).
54.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and with the established criteria for
Third Window Loans.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
55.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
loan.

C.   PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Cr. No. 100, Ln. No. 490    CAM1DEV Project:  US$11 million Credit of March 28,
1967; Effective Date: July 7, 1967; Closing Date:
June 30, 1972 and US$7 million Loan to CAMDEV of
same date; Effective Date: July 7, 1967; Closing
Date: June 30, 1977 (Original Closing Date:
December 31, 1974).
The planting programs are now nearly completed, satisfactorily,
and the company is entering into a much needed consolidation period. High
level management is now Cameroonized, and the take-over from the expatriate
General Manager went smoothly.    However, the new General Manager, a capable
person with a financiaL background, needs seasoning and technical support
for some time. The project is now running on a sound basis and, with some
managerial improvement, the prospects are good.
Ln. No. 593 and Sp. Ln.     Oil Palm Project:   US$7.9 million Loan to SOPAME
No. 886                     of April 15, 1969; Effective Date:    August 14,
1969; Closing Date: December 31, 1976 and
US$1.7 million Supplemental Loan of April 9,
1973; Effective Date: October 19, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The project [s progressing satisfactorily and the plantation
of 8,500 ha of oil palm are nearly completed. The establishment of the
last 600 ha due to be planted in 1975 will, however, be deferred until
the 1976 planting season because it was necessary to use available plant-
ing stock to replenish young palms destroyed by rodents. The second mill,
at Eseka estate, was commissioned in May/June 1975. The estate housing
improvement program is underway. Early yields are in line with appraisal
projections; palm oil prices are higher than expected but so arE pro-
duction costs because of general inflation; nevertheless, the financial
prospects are good.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report
any problems which are being encountered, and the action taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

Ln. No. 604       Water Supply Project:   US$5 million Loan to SNEC of
June 2, 1969; Effective Date: November 4,1969;
Closing Date: December 31, 1974 (Original
Closing Date: May 31, 1972).
This project was completed on schedule with savings which have
been approved for investment in further water distribution works; however,
disbursements lagged due to the strong working capital position of the
Borrower and the closing date was postponed three times in order to allow
remaining funds to be disbursed. SNEC and Government (Guarantor) have
accepted the Bank's proposal for closure of the loan as of December 31,
1974 and the Bank has cancelled the unused balance of US$70,000.
Cr. No. 161       First Education Project:   US$10.5 million Credit of
September 23, 1969; Effective Date: April 29, 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976 (Original Closing
Date: June 30, 1974, first postponement December 31, 1975).
The implementation of this project was slow, especially in the
initial years. This resulted from delays in (i) selecting the consultants,
(ii) reaching agreement on schedules of accommodation, (iii) revising the
bidding documents, (iv) starting construction work for which over-priced
initial bids had to be cancelled, and (v) awarding contracts. The project
is now well managed and near completion. With the exception of additional
site-works, the construction of the project schools is completed. The pro-
curement of furniture is completed and the procurement of equipment will soon
be completed. All the schools are in operation. The technical assistance
program is about 30 months behind schedule due to slow selection process;
hence the closing date has been extended from December 31, 1975, to December
31, 1976. In May 1975 a supplementary Credit of US$1.2 million was approved
to cover cost increases due to currency realignments.
Cr. No. 229     Douala Port Project:   US$1.5 million Credit of January 14,
1971; Effective Date: April 14, 1971; Closing Date:
December 31, 1974; (Original Closing Date: June 30, 1973).
The Douala Port Project commenced in July 1972 and physical
work under the Credit was satisfactorily completed in November 1974. Credit
covenants and undertakings given during Credit negotiations have been
reasonably fulfilled, but financial targets have not been achieved in recent
years. Remedial measures are now being urged by the Association.
Cr. No. 302     SEMRY Rice Project:   US$3.7 million Credit of April 26, 1972;
Effective Date:   July 28, 1972; Closing Date:   June 30, 1976.
The project started in mid-1972 and is progressing satisfactorily.
Implementation is on schedule. Results achieved by the project in the fields
of production yields and agricultural practice improvements have largely ex-
ceeded anticipated targets. The project has been less successful in attract-
ing qualified Cameroonian staff and establishing an adequate financial manage-
ment. Attempts to correct these shortcomings are being made. The devaluation



ANNEX II
Page 4 of 6 pages
of the US dollar and additional works have increased costs by about 36 percent.
The Government, CCCE and FAC are financing the cost overrun.
Cr. No. 320     Second. Education Project:  US$9 million Credit of June 28,
1972, Effective Date: February 27, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1979.
Due to difficulties in selecting architects and agreeing on the
designs, project implementation was delayed by twenty-four months, but no
extension of the closing data of June 30, 1979, is expected. The project
is generally well managed, but faces severe cost overruns due to the ac-
celerated price increases which have occurred since 1973. Consequently
one item is to be financed under the proposed Third Education P'roject.
Cr. No. 429, Ln. No. 935    Second Highway Project:   US$24 million Credit of
September 26, 1973; Effective Date: December 20,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978 and
US$24 million Loan of same date; Effective Date:
December 20, 1973; Closing Date: December 31,
1978.
Because of inflation and the price escalation clause, bids for the
construction of the three roads were 30 percent higher than the appraisal es-
timates and costs are continuing to climb. The Government has awarded con-
struction contracts for roads at the original bid price and works have started
in December 1974. Construction of the Garoua-Mora road (260 km) is progress-
ing satisfactorily whereas it now appears that some delays of up to one year
might affect construction of the roads Douala-Pont du Nkam (161 km) and
Pont du Noum-Foumbari (50 km).    Progress of the project's consulting ser-
vice and technical assistance components has also been disappointing. The
project was re-appraised in September 1975 and the total cost is now esti-
mated at US$143 million. This would leave a financing gap of about US$74
million. In view of the unexpected magnitude of the cost overruns and the
absence of additional financing from new donors, the Government has agreed
to postpone construction of one road section (90 km). This would reduce
total project cost to about US$121 million of which about US$83 million are
foreign exchange costs. A supplementary credit of US$15 million was approved
in March 1976 to help alleviate the burden imposed on the Government by the
project's cost overruns.
Ln. No. 983     Livestock Project:   US$11.6 million Loan of May 14, 1974;
Effective Date: September 16, 1974; Closing Date: June 30,
1980.
Project implementation is generally good and appointment of project
staff has been completed. Results obtained at one of the project ranches are
exceptionally good, but a second ranch has encountered serious start-up dif-
ficulties. Bids for the construction of the two slaughter plants are to be
invited by March 1976. About 70 livestock credits are expected to be pro-
cessed during 1976, and the tsetse-fly eradication campaign is likely to start
in December 1976, as scheduled. Disbursements have been slow, but are expected
to accelerate when the construct[on of the slaughter plants begins.

Ln. No. 1038    Second Railway Project:   US$16.0 million Loan to REGIFERCAM
of September 18, 1974; Effective Date: December 18, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Procurement of main project items is well underway; track
material is being delivered and rolling stock should be available by end
1975. Problems were encountered in the construction of foundations for
the Japoma Bridge. Selection of consultants for the management assistance
and for the Douala-Yaounde transport corridor study is proceeding satis-
factorily and contracts are expected to be signed soon. Due to the present
world slump in the timber market and a recent substantial increase in staff
costs, REFIGERCAM will have difficulty in attaining the financial covenants
included in the Loan Agreement. The project is also confronted with a
financing gap of about US$2 million due to currency realignments. Other
financing agencies have been approached to fill part of the gap. Addi-
tional financing for the studies has been recommended under the proposed
Third Railway Project (Douala Station Engineering Project).
Ln. No. 1039     Cocoa Project:   US$6.5 million Loan of September 18, 1974;
Effective Date: February 26, 1975. Closing Date: June 30,
1981.
The Project has made continuing progress in establishing its
structure as well as organizing the training program and field development.
The management is still somewhat weak and, as a result, efficient coordina-
tion of the various activities is lacking. No serious cost overruns are
expected, except for a small shortfall during the Project's first two years
which has been estimated at about US$0.3 million; Government's contribution
will be increased by this amount. The roads program component of the
Project is, however, not progressing well. Measures envisaged by the Bank
are: (a) enlisting RMWA's help in organizing a mission of the Highway
Engineer to review the situation and to make recommendations for the setup
of an operational Feeder Roads Department, and (b) exploring the possibility
of having an expatriate Highway Engineer put at the head of this Department.
Project implementation in the field is proceeding satisfactorily. The
project's planting program is carried out in line with appraisal forecasts.
Supply of inputs has been satisfactorily organized and nurseries properly
developed.
Credit No. 574 Niete Rubber Estate Project: US$16.0 million Credit of
June 3, 1975; Effective Date: December 1, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980.
Activity at the Niete Rubber Estate got under way immediately
upon the arrival of management personnel on-site in August 1975. Some
planting has already been done in advance of schedule, and a first
village for laborers is under construction. The management team, pro-
vided under contract by a plantation firm, SAFACAM, is highly competent
having had extensive experience in Asia, and having become available due
to the loss of Cambodian estates. Despite lateness by one Government

agency in subscribing its share of a necessary HEVECAM capital increase,
all documents related to credit effectiveness were received on time, and
effectiveness was declared, December 1st, 1975, as scheduled.
Credit No. 575    Small and Medium-Scale Enterprise Project:   US$3.0 million
Crelit of July 1, 1975; Effective Date: June 2, 1976
(or:iginal effectiveness date: December 1, 1975; first
posl:ponement: February 2, 1976); Closing Date:
December 31, 1980.
Credit effectiveness has been postponed to June 2, 1976 to enable
fulfillment of conditions of effectiveness relating to technical assistance
contracts and co-financing arrangements.

Financing Plan:               The foreign exchange costs of the project amount
to US$17.0 million equivalent, or about 68
percent of the total project cost, and would be
entirely financed by the proposed Third Window
loan.
Technical Assistance:         The design, planning and supervision of the
construction of all project institutions
would be undertaken by consulting architects
financed by the project (US$0.6 million).
They are expected to be locally recruited;
they would be assisted in the engineering
work by consultants acceptable to the Bank.
The project also provides 52 man-years of
other professional services and technical
assistance for several of the sub-projects
(para. 42) for a total cost of US$3.1 million
and an average cost of US$60,000 per man-year
(of which US$40,000 is estimated to be for
salaries). Under their terms of reference,
all project specialists would be required to
train counterparts. An additional amount of
US$0.5 million is provided for pre-investment
studies and preparation of a future education
project.

Page 4 of 4 pages
Retroactive financing in the amount of US$300,000
is recommended for the cost of services of the con-
sulting architects who would be working on the
sketch designs for the project institutions prior
to Loan signature (up to a maximum of US$50,000);
and for the Bank's share of the cost of building
works for the lower secondary technical school in
Douala (up to a maximum of US$250,000) for which
expenditures are expected to start prior to
Loan signature.
Procurement Arrangements:     Contracts for bullding works (US$12.1 mil-
lion), furniture (US$0.7 million) and equip-
ment (US$5.8 million) would be awarded fol-
lowing international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines. The
building works are within the capacity of
Cameroon's construction industry. Local
contractors would be given a domestic pref-
erence of 7-1/2 percent In bid evaluation.
Contracts for furniture and equipment (US$6.5
million) would be let in packages of at least
US$20,000. Manufacturers of furniture and
equipment In Cameroon and in member countries
of UDEAC, would be allowed a preference equal
to the lower of (a) 15 percent of the c.i.f.
price on imported goods or (b) the prevailing
duties generally applied to non-exempt imports.
Farm animals, small agricultural implements,
and other equipment, which are not suitable
for competitive bidding or cannot: be grouped
in packages of at least US$20,000, would be
procured locally on the basis of quotations
according to local procedures which are
acceptable to the Bank. The total of all
such purchases should not exceed US$300,000
over the duration of the project.
