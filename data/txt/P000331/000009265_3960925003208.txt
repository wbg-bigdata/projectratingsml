PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF CANEROON
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1245T-CM)
PREFACE
This is a Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Third Education
Project in Cameroon, for which a World Bank loan was extended to the
Republic of Cameroon in July 1976.    The loan became effective in December
1976. The esttimated total cost of the project was US$24.5 million, of
which US$17 million was covered by the loan. The loan account was closed
cn November 12, 1985 and the undisbursed balance of US$82,169.92 was
cancelled.
This PCR was prepared by a Unesco mission for the Government of
Cameroon under the terms of the Cooperative Agreement and revised by the
Western Africa Regional Office.    The valuable assistance provided by the
Government--particularly by the  Project  Implementation Unit staff--toward
the preparation of the report is gratefully acknowledged.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
reporting, this PCR was read  by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED)
but the project was not audited by  ORD  staff.   The draft PCR was sent to
the Borrower and its agencies for comments in March 1987. No comments were
received.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF CAMEROON
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 1245T-CM)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
This project is based upon pre-investment studies financed under
the Second Education Project.   Identification  was carried out by IDA with
the assistance of the  PAO  Cooperative  Program.   Project preparation was
completed in November 1974 and appraisal was undertaken by a Bank mission
in February/March 1975 (para.  2.5).    A  bank  loan  of US$17 million was
approved in April 1976. The amount was to cover 68.4 percent of the esti-
mated project cost  including  contingencies.    However, the final project
cost was 81 percent higher than the appraisal estimate in local currency
and 36 percent higher in US$  resulting  in  the Bank loan covering only 51
percent of costs (paras. 1.5, 5.1, 8.4).
Oblectives and Prolect Content
The Third Education Project was designed to support the implemen-
tation of manpower training programs in the Agricultural and Industrial
sectors. The project financed construction, equipment and furniture fort
(a)    Two lower secondary technical schools (CETs);
(b)    Three secondary agricultural schools (ETA-CRAs);
(c)    An institute for  training  higher technicians in agriculture
and livestock (ITA) including three field stations (Antenne-
ITAs); and
(d)    Three  rural  health  training  centers  (CSDEs).   Technical
Assistance was provided for part of (a), (b) and (c), project
implementation and the preparation of a future education
project.
Implementation Experience
Significant delays were noted in the implementation of the project
(113 months as opposed to the appraisal estimate of 66 months). The clos-
ing date was extended three times and the loan account was closed with a



- vii -
cancellation of US$82,170. This was a result of several factor includings
change of Project Implementation Unit (PIU) director twice, both of whom
showed poor managerial capability, limited capacity of construction firms,
change of project site (ITA from Nbolbisson to Dschang) requiring change in
architectural design, unreliable contractors who defaulted in their con-
tracts (ITA-Dschang and Antenne-ITA) and MOE's non-conformity with Bank's
prccurement procedures, which resulted in delay in the availability of
local funds to cover 100 per cent of expenditures for two construction
contracts. Further delays were caused by the Ministry of Finance using a
cumbersome bureaucratic process of repaying contractors.
Firdings and Lessons
Although the final cost of the project far exceeds appraisal esti-
mates, the scope of the project was not compromised and all components were
implemented. Of the twelve project components having construction, equip-
ment and furniture inputs, five more or less attained their educational
objectives  (CETI-Ngaoundere,  ITA-Dschang   and   three  ETA-CRAs),  three
partially attained them (CETIC-Douala and two CSDEs) and four did not (one
CSDE and three Antenne-I1.s).
Utilization of the buildings is, in general, satisfactory with
respect to laboratories and classrooms, although for the latter some
adjustment had to be made to increase the size of the smaller classrooms
(12 placesl in all  of  the  ETA-CRAs.    Dormitory facilities are at fifty
percent occupancy due to Government scholarship policy which encourages
(particularly second year) students to live off-campus. Workshop facili-
ties in all three ETA-CRAs and CSDEs are hardly utilized as the equipment,
although delivered, are for the most part either not installed or tested.
One of the Important factors that contributed to the delay of the
project implementation was a weakness in the project design involving five
Government agencies including the Ministries of Education, Higher Education
Agriculture, Livestock and Public Health.
More specially, the following observations are made with respect
to the implementation of the physical infrastructure, furniture and
equipment:
(a)    selection of sites  has  not  been  taken into account either
urban expansion or pedagogical requirements, with a view to
obtaining (i) sufficient land for construction (ECTIC-Douala,
ITA-Dschang); and (ii) adequate land for extra-curricula
activities (ETA-CRA Maroua, and CETIC-Douala) (para. 4.2);
(b)    Construction of Boarding  Facilities  have  not  been made in
accordance with (i) the requirements of schools located in
urban areas and; (ii) national policy regarding the award of
fellowships,  including  payment   of  subsistence  allowance
(para. 4.3);



- viii -
(c)    DesiSn of Facilities have  not  been made in accordance with
pedagogical  requirement,   prevailing  climatic  conditions,
maintenance practice and budgetary allocation (Annex 1(a));
(d)    Equipmont lists have been  prepared with inadequate consider-
ation to knowledge and ability of the users. Procurement
arrangemonts might have included this requirement, with a
view to ensuring the availability of local representatives
able to undertake listallation, testing, maintenance of
equipment and furnishing of spare parts, and training of
users (par&. 4.11); and
(e)    the managerial capacity  of  the  Project Implementation Unit
should be strengthened (para. 8.4).
Sustainability
It Is felt that the project has expended the country's capacity to
train the required manpower. In fact, in future there would be an over-
production of such personnel. The next step would be to promote qualita-
tive improvements of the training program and to raise the level of
training standard.
One of the main activities related to the sustainability of the
project is the involvement of the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and
Research in redefining the different levels of training in agriculture.
There seems to be duplicity in training program offered by the different
project institutions.
At the Centre Universitaire de Dachang, there is a need to streng-
then coordination of activities between the Ministries of Agriculture and
Livestock.  In order to reduce the rivalry in the comon use of the project
faculties, the communication between ITA and the ETA-CRAs needs to be rein-
forced. This should be initiated with the appointment of one project
director and two deputy-directors instead of the present two directors, one
for each institutiop. The Ministry of Agriculture should provide clearly
defined guidelines for the ETA and CRA in order to enable the two institu-
tions to utilize project facilities with maximum efficiency (para 1.18).
Dormitory faculties in Bambili and Ebolowa remain underutilized.
This might be remedied if the Ministry of Agriculture were to review its
policy of paying students' outside expenses thus, obliging students to stay
on-campus.
Due to poor site selection for some of the project institutions
their farmlands are being parcelled out for other projects. The Ministry
of Agriculture has yet to take steps to acquire additional farmland outside
the city limits (para. 7.7). In addition to the above requirements for the
sustainability of the project, the Centre Universitaire de Dechang has yet
to develop concrete plans for the use of the Antenne-ITAs which are
presently, for the most part idle.

PROJECT CWUIZTIOR REpOR
I.  SWUART  CONCLUSIONS AND 158603S lEAEDS
Physical Impleinntation
1.1       Prolonged delays were noted in the implementatior of the
project (113 months as opposed to the appraisal estimate of 66 months).
The closing date was extended three times and the Loan closed with
a  cancellation  of  US$82,170.   This  was  due  to  several  factors
includings change of Project Implmentation Unit (PIU) directors
twice who, for the most part, provided poor managerial capability,
limited capacity of construction firms, changes of project site (ITA
from Nkolbisson to Dschang) requiring change in architectural design,
unreliable contractors who defaulted in their contracts (ITA-Dschang
and Antenne-ITA) and MOE's non-conformity with the Bank's procurement
procedures, which resulted in delay in the availability of local
funas to cover 100 per cent of expenditure for two construction
contracts.
1.2       A  cumbersome bureaucratic process of repaying contractors
being used by the Ministry of Finance which, on many occasions,
resulted in refusal to check receipts and approve authorization of
payment by Bank caused further delays.  At the time of completion
a joint meeting was held involving the PIU, Ministries of Finance
and Planning to improve the process of payment and ways to accelerate
it. Approximately 30 stages between the contractor's payment claim
and the availability of funds destined for the contractor's account
were identified.
Adequacy and Utilization of huildings and *cutpm t
1.3       Construction,  equipment  and  furniture  were  completed  as
planned  at  appraisal,  but  with  some  delay.   In  general,  the
construction work is of good quality and the buildings are suited
to pedagogical  requirements.   Not  all  equipment was  installed  In
good time, with some being delivered before the physical facilities
were  ready  (CSDE-Blabili)  and  some delayed  (ETA-CRA-Maroua).  The
equipment provided for CETIC-Douala and Ngaounddrd was, by and large,
suitable while that of the ETA-CRA was found to be unnecessarily
sophisticated and heavy, in place of what should have been a lighter
and more practical type.
1.4       Utilization of the buildings is, in general, satisfactory
with respect to laboratories and classrooms, although in the case
of the latter some adjustment had to be made to increase the size
of the smaller classrooms (12 places) in all of the ETA-CRAs.
Dormitory facilities are not fully utilized, with only 50 per cent
occupancy, this being mainly attributable to the Government scholarship
policy which encourages 'particularly second-year students) to live
off-campus.   Workshop  facilities  in all  three ETA-CRAs and CSDEs
are hardly utilized as the equipment, although delivered, is for
the most part not Installed or tested. _

1.5       Total estimates for the whole project includinlLfontingencies
at appraisal were 5,592,280,000 FCFA or US$24,854,550.-   The Bank's
financing of US$17 million was expected to cover 68.4 per cent of
total estimated costs including contingencies.   As implemented,  the
final project cost is 10,147,432,552 PCFA or US$33,823,000 equivalent
at the medium exchange rate of 300 ?CIA for 1 US$, approximately
81 per cent higher than the appraisal estimates An local currenty
and 36 per cent higher in US$. The Bank's financiag of US$16,917,830-,
covered  51 per cent of the actual costs.   Construction costs  for
two components (CETI of Ngaouuddrd and lTACRA of Ebolove for an amount
of US$5,914,000) were financed 100 per cent by the  overnomt, due
to  non-conformity  with  the  Bank's  procuremeat  guidelines.   Other
expenditures were made in accordance with percentage of relibursemant
agreed in the Loan Agreement (paras. 5.1-5.3.
roJect MKs-sasmmt
1.6       The Project Implementation Unit (PIU), in general, operated
unsatisfactorily. During the early period of Implementation the PIU
was left without a director for five months (March to August 1978).
The second director, during his two and a half year's stay with the
project,  experienced  managerial  difficulties.   Under  the  third
director, considerable progress was made in enhancing the completion of
the project, although with a great deal of Bank insistence to this
effect.  The PIU has,  in general, suffered from lack of qualified
personnel having both managerial skills and dynamim (para. 3.4).
1.1       The structure of the PIU vis-&-vis the Ministries of Finance
and Planning, as well as the participating ministries, has not been
sufficiently upgraded to allow effective participation in the decision-
making process and adequate coordination (paras 8.2 and 8.4).

Technical Education
Igaounddd - Coll&g  d'Enseig!eMsnt Techbiqu! Industriel (CuT!)
1.8       Construction was completed and teaching commenced in January
1983.  As foreseen at appraisal,  the CET was designed as a three-
year post-primary level training institution to accommodate 210
students, including a 120-place dormitory of which only 70 are
occupied. In 1985, total enrolment was 215 (21 girls).
1.9       The  programme of studies  includes specialization  in four
areas,  namely  metalwork,  electricity,  automechanics  and  industrial
mechanics.   The quality of the  training  is gradually improving as
the Institute is becoming more organized after moving into the project
facilities.  In 1986, it is estimated that about 60 per cent of the
fourth-year class will graduate while that of 1987 is expected to
rise to 90 per cent (para. 6.19).

Douala Collg  d'aeigsp ent Tegebsiqe (CETIC)
1.10      CETIC  began  functioning  in  November  1978  with  workshop
facilities. The teaching facilities provided by the project became
functional In 1983 and equipment w&S delivered in October 1984. As
was the case for CETI-Ngaounddrd, the extension of the course to
four-years and the increase of the enrolment from 750 foreseen at
appraisal to 1,106 (327 girls) in 1985/86 has brought about the problem
of classroom/workshop accomodation. Efforts are being made to reduce
the annual intake of new students in order to correct the situation.
1.11      The teaching quality of the Institute appears to be weak
with a pass-rate of 19 per cent in 1985.   The major problem  were
found to be under-qualified teachers (50 per cent), students having
weak academic background, availability of minimum teaching and working
materials, and a relatively high staff/student ratio of about 1*30
(paras. 6.20, 6.21).
Centre Universitaire de  scimces de la Samt6 (COsS)
1.12      At appraisal, it was foreseen that the project would provide
construction, furniture and equipment of three field clinics with
student dormitory and cafeteria facilities at Bambill, Bandengwe
and Ngaounddrd Dibi, to organize practical training for pre-med
students and para-medical personnel such as nurses, as well a1
providing medical services to the surrounding rural communities.
1.13      All  three  CSDEs  have  been  constructed,  equipped  and
furnished. The clinics at Ngaoundere Dibi and Bambill are only partly
functional. Hence, the project's educational objectives have not
been fulfilled (paras. 6.22, 6.23).
Agricultural Educatiou and Training
Ecoles Techniques d'Agriculture (ETA)
1.14      The  project  provided  for  the  expansion  and  improvement
of two existing ETAs at Ebolowa and Maroua, and for establishing
a new ETA at Bambili. All three ETAs have been established as planned
and  have  begun  functioning.   During  the period  1983-1985,  a total
of 161 Category C-level technicians were trained (para. 6.7, Table).
1.15      At appraisal it was foreseen that under the Project enrolment
would be raised from about 40 students in 1977 to 180, with an annual
intake  of  90  students  and  annual  output of 80.   At  the time of
completion   (December  1985),  total enrolment of the three ETAs was
put at  125 with an annual output  (in the same year) of 74.   The
projected enrolment from 1987 onward shows full utilization of project
facilities except in the case of ETA-Bambili (Annexes 3 and 11).
Colleges Rdgionaux d'AKriculture (CRA)
1.16      The project also provided for the expansion and improvement
of the CRA in Bambili and for the establishment of two new similar
colleges in Ebolowa and Maroua, raising the total enrolment to 240.
The three CRAs are functioning, producing 122 B.2 and 192 B.1
categories of agricultural technicians during 1983-1985 (para. 6.7,
Table).   The total enrolment  in the  1985/86 academic year was  233
(Annex 11).



-4-
1.17      The  above-mentioned  types  of  training  institutions  (ETA-
CRA) were constructed on the same campus, with a view to enhancing
the effective use of project facilities that are comon to both types
of training, including workshops, laboratories, dining and kitchen
facilities,  as well as the school farm.  Dormitory facilities have
been provided for all student participants.
1.18      To  facilitate  the  implementation  of  this  plan  the ETA-
CRAB were to be managed administratively by one director at each
campus as planned at appraisal. Since then the Governmeat decided
to appoint a director for each of the ETA. and CRA thus making them
separate  entities.    This  arrangement  does not  lend itself to the
efficient utilization of the coion facilities mentioned above (para.
7.5).
Institut des Techniges Agiecoles (ITA)
1.19      ITA was transferred from its original site at Nkolblsson
as foreseen at appraisal and established at the Centre Universitaire
de Dschang (CUD).  The project has provided teaching space for 300
and dormitory facilities for 180 students although the total enrolment
foreseen  at  appraisal was  put at  150.   The  enrolment  in  1985/86
academic year was 540 which was made possible by the use of additional
teaching and dormitory facilities originally intended to train farm
mechanics (para. 4.6). The two types of training programs undertaken
are   'Ing8nieurs  de  Travaux  Agricoles'   (A.1)  and  'Techniciens
d'Agriculture'  (B.1).   During the period  1981-1985, graduate output
has been put at 531 A.1 and 648 B.1. Project facilities became fully
operational in October 1985 (paras. 6.8-6.10).
Antenno-ITA (Field Training Centres)
1.20      The  project,   as  foreseen  at  appraisal,   financed  the
construction, furniture and equipment of three field training centres
(Antenne-ITAs) at Bambili, Ebolowa and Maroua ETA-CRA Campuses. All
three ITAs have been established, as plmnned.   However, very little
use has been made of them due to the failure of ITA-Dschang to develop
the field training programme for its prospective gradu,tes as foreseen
at appraisal (paras. 6.11 and 7.9).
Mana|gemnt of Agricultural Education
1.21      There were  three specialists  provided by the project who
played a vital  role  in developing  the curricula of  the ETA-CRAs.
In August 1981, for each of the three ETA-CRAs an educational adviser
(conseiller-pedagogique) was posted to assist in the implementation
of the new curricula.   These  advisers  continued  to work  in their
respective positions until 1985 and were later employed by the
Government, until the end of 1985.
Conclusions
1.22      Although  the  final cost of the project far exceeds that
foreseen at appraisal, the scope of the project was not compromised
considering  all  components  implemented.   The  additional cost paid
by the Government raised the final project cost 81 per cent higher
than appraisal estimates in local currency and 36 per cent in
US. dollars (para. 5.1). The project implementation period was almost
twice as long as initially planned. Of the twelve project components



. 5 -
having construction/equipment/furniture inputs, five more or less
reached their educational objectives (CETI-Ngaounddrd$ ITA-Dechang
and three ETA-CRA9), three partially attained them (CETIC-Douala
and two CSDEs); and finally, four did not attain (one CSDE and three
Antenne-ITAs).
Lessons Learned
1.23      One of the important factors that contributed to the delay
of the project execution has been a weakness in the project design
involving five Government agencies in the implementation of the
project, including the Ministries of Education, Higher Education,
Agriculture, Livestock and Public Health.
1.24      More  specifically,  the  following  observations  are  made
with respect to the implementation of the physical lnfrastructure,
furniture and equipment:
(a) Selection of Sites should have been made by taking into
account the urban expansion and pedagogical requirements,
with a view to obtaining (i) sufficient land for constructi2n
(CETIC-Douala, ITA-Dachang)s and (it) adequate land for
extra-curricula   activities   (ETA-CRA Maroua,   and  CETIC-
Douala) (para. 4.2);
(b) Construction of Boarding Facilities should have been made
in accordance with (1) the requirements of schools located
in urban areas andt (i1) national policy regarding the
award  of  fellowships,  including  payment  of  subsistence
allowance (para. 4.3);
(c) Design of Facilities should have been made in accordance
with pedagogical requirement, prevailing climatic conditions,
maintenance practice and budgetary allocation (Annex l(a);
(d) Equipment lists should have been prepared giving due
consideration  to  knowledge  and  ability  of  the  users.
Procurement should have included this requirement, with
a view to ensuring the availability of local representatives
able to undertake Installation, testing, maintenance of
equipment and funishing of spare parts, and training of
users (para. 4.11)
(e) The World Bank and Government should strengthen the manag-
erial capacity of the Project Implementation Unit (para.
8.4).

Socio-Econouic Setting
2.1       Csmeroon io a country of an estimated nine and a half million
people (1984) located in Western Africa between 2° and 120 latitude
bordering Nigeria in the West, Chad and Central African Republic
in the East, and Gabon, Congo and the Atlantic Ocean in the South.
The Southern and South-eastern regions of the country are covered
with rain forests, gradually giving way to bushland and savannah
grassland  Iowards  the North.   The total  land area of Caeroon  is
457,000 M       The country is divided Into teO  prov4les.  In 1976,

the real active population between the ages of 15 and 59 years was
estimated at 39.9 per cent.  Traditionally, Cameroon has been self-
sufficient in food production with significant surplus for export
(cotton, coffee, cocoa, palm oil) to neighbouring countries.   Since
the beginning of petroleum production In 1978, the country experienced
rapid growth due to its increased revenue, but later was followed
by the economic recession which adversely affected its agricultural
sector. The Fifth National Plan (1981-1986) was designated to address
the basic problems with a view to increasing agricultural productivity.
2.2       During the peribd 1976/77-1982/83, the annual GDP increase
was 7.9 per cent at conbtant prices reaching 1,038,400 million FCFA
(2,156,000 million FCFA ;current prices) as against 657,200 million
FCFA in 1976/77. The contribution of agriculture has been 24.2 per
cent, manufacturing and mining about 20-24 per cent (6.7 petroleum)
5.09 construction and commerce and other services 50.44 per cent.
The annual GDP rate of growth which was put at seven per cent during
the current Fifth Plan period is expected to decline to 4.8 per cent
during 1986-1991.
Education Dove logmut and Strategy Issues
2.3       To meet the manpower demand for its developmental efforts,
the Government has been continuously engaged in preparing a strategy
for education and financing coherent with its economic, social and
pedagogical  needs.   The succession of the country's Five-Year Plan
begun in 1961, up to the present Plan (1981-1986) emphasizes these
aspirations. According to a recent study undertaken by the Government
in whick Unesco and the World Bank participated (September/October
1985), the specific areas of future development identified includedt
(a) adaptation of the educational system towards meeting the
manpower requirements of the country;
(b) improvement of the efficiency and quality of general
education;
(c) control the expansion and orientation of the flow of
students;
(d) ensure trained manpower demands are satisfied in the agri-
cultural and industrial sectors, both in the short- and
long-term;
(e) control the expansion of higher education and diversify
Its programe efficiently;
(f) control the expansion of the agricultural training programmes
and increase the efficiency of the lower-level technician
training programmes;
(g) increasing the agricultural productivity of the smallholder
peasant;  and
(h) facilitate the planning of educational activities with
a view to enabling the development of a haronious system.



-7-
2.4       The Government  is, at present, allocating 18 per cent of
its total budget (capital and recurrent) and about 25 per cent of
its recurrent expenditure.   The rate of the budget growth for the
education sector is 10.2 per cent as against 7.9 per cent for the
national budget. This budget includes the expenditures of more than
twenty other ainistries, and public and private agencies. As regards
the breakdown of costs, 85 per cent is spent on personnel and the
rest on educational material and other services (I.St primavy, 32
lower secondary, 71.2 lycdes, 3-lOS technical).
To achieve the goals outlined abqve, the Government is
seeking outside assistance including the World Bank. An Educational
and Vocational Training Project (4th project) has been approved by the
Bank's Board of Directors (29 A.,ril 19%).

2.5       The Third Education Project resulted from discussion) based
on a pro-investment study (September 1973) prepared by the 'Institute
de Recher'che d'Application des Mithodes de Ddveloppeusnt' (IRAN)
which was financed by the World Bank as part of the technical
assistance component of the Second Education Project in Cameroon.
This was followed by the Bank's Agricultural Education Recoanaissanc
Mission on 24 April  1974.  The Government request was prepared by
FAO  in November  1974.   The project was appraised by the Bank is
February/March 1975.  The Board approval was obtained in April 1976
and the Loan Agreement was signed on 2 July 1976 and becam effective
on 31 December 1976.  The estimated total cost of the project was
US$24.854 million of which US$17 million was covered by the Bank
loan.
Description of the Project
Objectives
2.6       As  specified  in  the  Appraisal  Report,  the  project  was
designed to assist the Government in continuing its effort to develop
the country's technical education system and to achieve the objectives
of the Second Education Project financed by IDA.  Specifically,  it
would assist technical education by:
(a) financing the lower secon4ary technical school in Douala,
originally included in the Second Project; and
(b)  financing  a  new  lower  secondary  technical  school  at
Ngaoundir4 to train skilled workers.
2.7       The proposed project would also make agricultural and health
education a more effective and cost efficient tool for agricultural
and rural development through appropriately designed programmes in
new or expanded institutions and through improvement in student/teacher
ratios.  A reformed  system of agricultural education would supply
the qualified manpower that would introduce improved agricultural
methods and change attitudes towards agriculture. An important element
of the reform would be the adaptation of training to the specific
needs of the main agro-ecological regions of Cameroon.  Specifically,
it would assist in:



(a) improving the management of agricultural education;
(b) increasing the system's efficiency and reducing its unit
costs;
(c) upgrading the extension services by incrtasing the number
of trained agents, improving the training of all agricultural
extension personnel and laying the basis for a rural
information system;
(d) filling a gap in the agricultural manpower structure by
starting a new prograise for training higher technicians;
(e) supporting rural he:alth training; and
(f) coordinating agricultural programmes and curricula.
coEpoents
2.8       According  to  the  Appraisal  Report  the  project would be
implemented over the five-year period 1976-1980 and comprise:
(a) construction, equipment, furniture and, for item (ii) only,
technical assistance for:
i) a lower secondary technical school in Douala, including
a  training  section  for  lower  secondary  workshop
teachers; and
(ii) a lower secondary technical school in Ngaounddr6;
(b)  technical assistance  to strengthen  the MOA's capacity to
develop programmes of agricultural education and to supervise
their implementation;
(c) construction, equipment, furniture and technical assistance
for:
(i)  expanding and  improving two existing lower secondary
agricultural schools in Ebolowa and Maroua, and for
a new lower secondary agricultural school in Bambilli;
(ii)  expanding and improving the upper secondary agricultural
schools in Bambili, and for two new similar schools
in Ebolowa and Maroua (same sites as for item (i)
above); and
(iii)  establishing a programe for training higher technicians
in agriculture and livestock.
(d) construction, equipment and furniture for improving the
rural health training programme of the University Centre
for Health Sciences ('Centre Universitaire des Sciences
de la Sante' (CUSS)).

(e) technical assistance fors
(i) pre-investment studies and preliminary design work

Amendments
2.9       Despite delays, which occurred in the execution of certain
project components, the increase in construction costs, fluctuation
of the dollar exchange late, and non-conformity with the Bank's
standard procurement procedures, there was no formal amendment to
the  Loan  Agreement.   The  Bank  did  not  finance  two  construction
contracts (CETI-Ngaounddr6 and ETA-CRA Ebolowa).
Covenants of the Loan Agreement
2.10      In  general,  the  Government  fulfilled  the  conditions  of
the  Loan  Agreement,  on  occasion  with  delays  and  difficulties
(Annex 15).
III. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IIMPLEKENTION
3.1       The project was administered by the Project Implementation
Unit (PIU), ('Direction des Projets Education BIRD/CAM') which was
established under the framework of the first Credit Agreement.
Administratively, the PIU is placed under the authority of the General
Secretary, in the Ministry of National Education and is headed by
a project  director  and  assisted  by an administrative  staff.   The
PIU has not been adequat.ly staffed to manage the project.  The core
technical staff comprised one architect, one civil engineer, one
equipment specialist, one management specialist and one procurement
specialist (expatriates) both provided under the technical assistance
component (para. 3.6).
Loan Effectiveness
3.2       The Loan Agreement was signed on 2 July 1976 and declared
effective  31  December  1976,  three  months  later  than anticipated,
following the expansion of the Project Unit and the signing of the
consultant architect's contract by the Ministry of Finance.
Project Manaemnt
3.3       According  to Section 3.01(b)  of the Loan Agreement,  the
Project Unit established under the first (Credit 161-CM) and maintained
in the second (Credit 320-CM) education projects was expanded within
the Ministry of Education for:  co-ordination among the Borrower's
ministries,  departments  and  agencies  involved  in  the  project,
supervision of project implementation and liaison with the Bank.



- 10 -
3.4       Project management was generally unsatisfactory.   The PIU
suffered  many  changes  in  senior  staff.   Three  project  directors
operated during the project implementation period with an additional
five-month, period under an  lnterim director.   The management  also
suffered from lack of qualified workers with sufficient dynamism,
due to insufficient incentives.  The dominant position of the Project
Unit In the Ministry of Education and the minimum involvement of
other ministries in the project during implementation generated
communication  difficulties.   Five  ministries  were  responsible  for
the implementation of tke different project components. On the other
hand, staffing of the PIU foreseen at appraisal was not supported
by any of the ministries, with the exception of the Ministry of
Agriculture which seconded an officer for about one-month.
3.5       At the time of Completion, the PIU national technical staff
was reduced due to the retirement of the procurement specialist and
the change of position of the architect, now in charge of 'Service
des Projets' within the MOE, from full- to part-time work.
Technical Assistance
3.6       The  following  table  shows  technical  assistance  actually
provided for the PIU by the project in comparison with appraisal
estimates:

IV.  PIYSICAL IFLRENTATION
Sites
4.1       The  12  components  of  the  project  are  located  in  nine
different sites, including three 'Antenne-ITAs', sited on the three
ETA-CRA campuses.   The  site  for CETIC-Douala was  already selected
during the Second Education Project.
4.2       Two major  problems  arose with  regard  to existing  sites
during implementation, namely, urban encroachment in the town of
Maroua, whereby each year part of the agricultural area of the school
is absorbed into the town. With regard to Douala-CETIC, the population
has already occupied most of the land reserved for the institution,
leaving just enough for construction of the facilities without space
for extra curricular activities. The available land needed significant
costly site work and the rainwater drainage system had not been
correctly installed despite repeated Bank recommendations which,
consequently, left part of the workshop standing in one-foot of weter
throughout the rainy season.
4.3       Site selection for the ITA (whose location was transferred
from Nkolbisson, near YaoundA, to Dschang as a result of the
presidential decree of 28 April 1977) was very difficult due to the
limited areas available.   The site selected generated 53 great deal
of expensive work. Water is actually supplied by a 24 m water tank
which needs to be filled regularly, this being done by transporting
water by truck.   Construction of a water tower is under study by
the CUD, as well as access roadwork, and retaining wall to protect
the main building against erosion.

Architectural Design studieos
4.4       The architectural design studies  for the institution were
awarded to private local architectural consultants after consultation
with the Bank.  Contracts were signed at the end of 1976 and approved
by the Government in January 1977, except for CETIC-Douala, for which
studies were carried out under the Second Education Project.
4.5       Architectural design studies began at  he end of 1976 and
were completed at the end of November 1977, one-month behind appraisal
schedule with the exception of ITA-Dachang, due to change in site
as well as the schedule of accommodation for academic and boarding
facilities.   For  this  last  component,  studies  were  completed  in
November 1977, one-month behind schedule.
Architectural Design
4.6       Design work  for  the  three  ETA-CRAs,  the three  'Antenne-
ITAs' and the three CSDEs included in the project were made on the
basis  of  standardized design.   The  design adheres  to the original
working papers except for the ITA-Dechang whire the schedule of
accommodation was revised in agreement with the Bank, taking into
account  the  new  location  (Annex  2).   There was no need  for  farm
buildings  nor  staff  housing,  as  it  already  existed.   However,  it
was necessary to increase boarding facilities from 120 to 180, and
the academic  facilities  from 150 to 300 places.   Other details on
design work are given in Annex l(S).
Construction
4.7        International competitive bidding was used for all project
components in the first-stage after pre-qualification procedures.
Of the 21 pre-qualified firms, five were from outside Cameroon.
Invitations to bid were sent in January 1978, and these were received
in April 1978.
4.8       Due to cost overrun in most cases and/or the small number
of offers, only three contracts were awarded by the end of 1978.
A second tendering was undertaken on the basis of national competitive
bidding  for the remaining institutions on 28 July 1981.  Due to a
misunderstanding in following the Bank's guidelines for procurement,
the Bank suspended its financing for two institutions (CETI-Ngaounder&
and  ETA-CRA Ebolowa).   Those  contracts were awarded  in accordance
with local procedures and construction costs financed by the
Government.   Other details on construction work are given in Annex
l(b).
Furniture and RquXignt
4.9       The  PIU  prepared  all  equipment  and  furniture  lists  in
consultation with the Directorate of Agricultural Education for ETA-
CRA, Antenne-ITAs and ITA and with the Directorate of Technical
Education for CETIC-Douala and CETI-NgaounddrA. CUSS was responsible
for  the  preparation  of  equipment  lists  for  the  three  CSDEs.
Preparation of tender documents, in all cases, was the responsibility
of PIU.



- 13 -
4.10       International  competitive  bidding vas used  for  the major
part of the equipment and local competitive bidding for procurement
of  furniture.   Some  *ocal  selective  bidding was  made  for special
items with the agreeement of the Bank.  The major part of equipment
and furniture was delivered in accordance with the completion of
construction except for items for which PIU had to start new tendering
due to lack of response during the first stage.
4.11      In general,  furniture and equipment were satisfactory with
the  following exceptions.   In CETI-Ngaounddri,  the polyvinyl-pasted
table top is already 80 per cent disconnected.  Part of the w6rkshop
equipment included in each ETA-CRA is not in use, for different reasons
(eleectrical network remains unconnected, unskilled workers in charge
of equipment, lack of manuals, and maintenance not provided by the
supplier).   For  the  two  technical  schools,  equipment  provided  by
the project is complete and suitable, although with some problems
in Douala where equipment is used by unqualified students from the
neighbouring  college.   Insufficient  provision  of  spare  parts  and
working  material  greatly  affected  the  quality  of  training  and
examinations during the School Year.
4.12      For the CSDE the main part of the delivered equipment had
so far not been used, due to insufficient use of facilities by the
CUSS.
Maintenance of Facilities
4.13      Building maintenance  is  the responsibility  of  the users.
Most  of  the  buildings  receive  either  inadequate  or no attention,
due  to lack of personnel and/or  funds.  With the exception of two
cases (CETI-Ngaoundgre and ETA-CRA Bambili) external areas are not
maintained.
Technical Assistance
4.14      In   general,    technical   assistance   was   carried   out
satisfactorily.   Approximately  481  staff  months  were  financed  by
the project in place of the 624 foreseen at appraisal. Technical
assistance for the PIU was partly carried out by the expert financed
under the Second Education Project or coming fromi bilateral assistance.
For the administration of CETI-Ngaounder6, the post of director was
occupied  by  a  technical  assistant  provided  by  FAC.   Concerning
agricultural education, some posts were cancelled (one TA for each
ETA-CRA in place of one for each ETA, plus one for each CRA).  Due
to delays in implementation, these three posts were taken over by
the Government at the end of 1982 to the end of 1985.   Technical
assistance for ITA-Dschang was also nine-months over appraisal
estimates.   The  director's  post  is  occupied  by  a  Cameroonian.
Contracts for technical assistance were awarded after international
bidding.
4.15      Towards  the  end  of  the  project,  the  Organization  for
Rehabilitation and Training (ORT) team was very effective in putting
together the accounts of the project and preparing the equipment
lists for the Fourth and Fifth Education Projects.



- 14 -
4.16      At  the  outset,  the  technical  assistance  progromae  for
agriculture was not effectively utilized as experts were used as
instructors.   However,  with  the  insistance  of  the Bank,  they were
later used to develop the curriculum of ETA-CRAs, as foreseen at
appraisal.
Consultant Performance (Architect's Offices)
4.17      Two architectural-consultant  firms worked for the project,
both operating in Ccmeroon.   The choice of Cameroon firms was made
in order to avoid delays in project implementation, as experienced
in the Second Education Project.   The performance of the two offices
was good. However, issues have been raised regarding the architectural
design, mainly concerning adaptations of the facilities to local
prevailing conditions (maintenance problems and/or climatic conditions)
as well as the compatibility of the electrical system with the
equipment to be installed.
World Bank Performance
4.18      During  the  nine  and  a  half  years  of project  execution,
there were 22 supervision missions, i.e. 5.2 months, and the average
mission  length was  four  man-weeks.   Ten  of  the missions  included
an agricultural educator, thirteen a technical educator, four a civil
engineer, sixteen an architect, seven a general educator, three an
economist, three an educational planner and three a division chief.
Technical questions concerning conetruction, equipment and furniture
were followed consistently by the Bank but with limited results due
to  lack  of  effective  follow-up  by  the  PIU.   However,  the  Bank's
intervention for approval, disbursements, changes, ctc.. did not
always take place under normal conditions due to lengthy bureaucratic
procedure followed by the Ministry of Finance.  As regards technical
assistance,  the  Bank's  collaboration  was  satistactoryt   approval
of experts, and studies of future projects.   On the other hand, the
Bank was not very effective in assuring the pedagogical appropriateness
of the ETA-CRA equipment.
4.19      The components  and,  in particular,  those which could have
required a specialist's intervention, such as the preparation of
the programme of studies for ETA-CRA, MOA and CUD were followed up
by an agricultural educator, as required.
4.20      Problems  encountered  in  the  agricultural  and  technical
education areas were repeatedly brought to the attention of the
Ministries of Agriculture and Education by the Bank.  In particular,
the Bank made a persistent effort in advising the Government to find
a lasting solution to the recurrent problems concerning the management
of the PIU, since 1977.  Efforts to meet the educational objectives
of the CSDEs and the Antenne-ITAs may have been better achieved if
a more direct approach to the concerned ministries had been made
by the Bank in the absence of an effective and reliable link among
these agencies and the project unit.
4.21      Due to the wide dispersion of the project sites,  some of
the institutions (CSDE-Dibi and CSDE-Bandengwe) were not regularly
supervised.   Closer  follow-up might  have  improved chances  for  the
realisation of the educational objectives and service functions of
these institutions.

V. PROJCT COSTS AND ?INANCIIO
Prolect Oostvj and Pinaen.tg
5.1       A  comparloon  of  appraisal  estimates  and  actual  capital
costs for physical facilities, furniture and equipment, professional
services and technical assistance in local currencies ti shown in
Annex 3.  Total estimated costs for the project including contingencies
and excluding taxes at appraisal were CFAF 5,592,280,000 or the
equivalent of US $24,854,550.00. The Bank's financing of U8$17 million
was  expected  to  cover  68  per cent  of the  total estimated  costs
including contingencies. As implemented, the final cost of the project
was CFAP 10,147,432,000 or the equivalent of US$33,823,000.00, about
81 per cent higher than appraisal estimate in local currency and
36 per cent higher  in US dollars.  The  BSank  financed  51 per cent
if the actual costs with the Government covering the remainder.
5.2       A  detailed  comparison  of  appraisal  estimates  and  actual
costs by categories and items expressed in local currency and in
US dollars is shown in the following table and Annex 4.

5.3       As compared with appraisal estimates including contingencies,
three categories (civil works, furniture and professional services)
had cost overruns in terms of US dollars and all the categories
expressed  in  local  currency.   The  high  construction  cost  of most
of the components was due to the requirement of additional site work
(CETIC-Douala, ITA-Dschang) delays  in implementation  involving;  (a)
change of site, and institute capacity, and bankruptcy of contractor
for ITA-Dschang; (b) non-conformity with the Bank's procurement
procedures for CETI-Ngaounddrd and ETA-CRA Ebolowa, with consequent
delay in the availability of funds which were totally financed by
the  Government;   and  (c)  complementary  work  for water  supply  for
ITA-Dschang and all CSDEs.  The cost overrun  for furniture was due
to delays in the availability of facilities, price increase of labour
and local materials and transportation cost due to the awarding of
contract  to  only  one  supplier  not  taking  into  account  local



- 16 -
transportation problems.  Professional services were, in fact, largely
under  the  appraisal  price e3timates.   The global cost overrun for
technical assistance is due to cost of the otudiqs for the Fourth
Education Project.   Costs of equipment were  in line wit's appraisal
estimates in terms of US dollars with an underrun for the CETIC-
Douala. Technical assistance shows a low cost overrun.
Areas and Cost per Student Place
5.4       Area per student place increased up to 24 per cent except
for two components (CETIC-Douala and Antenne-ITA Bambili).  In terms
of local currency there is a large cost increase per square meter
for each  item except  for  the  ITA-Bambili.   Details   on the above
are provided in Annex 5.
Disbursement
5.5       The  Borrower  was  informed  that  the  closing  date  of 31
December 1984 was maintained and that the Bank would continue to dis-
burse for applications received prior to 30 June 1985. The limit date
for submitting applications was then extended to 30 September 1985.
US$16,917,820.08 were disbursed out of a loan of 17 million dollars.
US$82,169.92 equivalent to 0.' per cent of the loan were cancelled. A
eomparison of the original esAlmation and actual disbursement of the
loan proceeds by category is shown in the Key Project Data Table.
5.6       The   objective   of   increasing   the   efficiency   of  the
agricultural health training system and reducing the unit cost as
envisaged  at  appraisal was not  realised.   This was  mainly due  to
the under-enrolment of the project institutions (except for ITA-
Dschang) and the 50 per cent utilization of dormitory facilities
(para. 2.7 (b)).

6.2       At  appraisal,  the  enrolments  of  the  'Ecole  Technique
Agricoles'  or  Lower  Secondary  Agricultural  Schools  were  intended
to be raised from about 40 to 180 with an annual intake of 90 students
and  an annual  output  of 80.   At  the time of completion all the
classerom and dormitory facilities were provided by the project as
planned.   However,  the enrolment was put at  134 of which 19 were
girls, with the remaining vacancies yet to be filled.
6.3       During the past three years, 161 'agents technique' graduated
and are now mostly working in the Ministry of Agriculture and its
allied agencies.   In general, employers have expressed the need for
well planned programmes to exploit the potential offered by the
graduates.
6.4       The programe of studies was developed  in which a major
input was made by the three expatriate specialists provided by the
project.  The overall view regarding the teaching programe developed
by objectives is that it is overloaded.  It is felt that the content
of a three-year programme has been compressed into a two-year
programme, hence, the need for more time to implement it.
6.5       The manpower study of the Ministry of Agriculture undertaken
by 'l'Association pour la Formation des Cadres de l'Industrie et
de l'Administration' (AFCA) indicates the need to closely monitor
the number of ETA graduates that will be required in the future.
There are 4,896 Category D monitors, of whom a significant number
can be upgraded.   The demand for ETA graduates (C) by the year 2000
is put at 4,796 as against 1,018 in 1985 (Annexes 7 and 8). This
would seem to signify that the future role for ETA is to significantly
reduce the number of newly-created (C) graduates and focus on the
upgrading of monitors.
Coll!&es rdgiouaux d'Agriculture (CRA)
6.6       The three CRAs, established in the same campus of the ETAs
visited by the mission were found to be in functional order.  The
use  of  common  facilities  including  workshops,  farm  buildings,
laboratories has been limited. The dormitory and cafeteria facilities
at Ebolova and Bambili are about 50 per cent utilized. This appears
to be due to an over-estimation of the need for such facilities at
appraisal  (para.  7.6).   However,  the  classrooms  and  laboratories
in all three institutions are satisfactory, with the programme of
studies being conducted as planned (Annex 17).
6.7       The total enrolment of the three CRAs was 246, only 9 short
of the appraisal estimate of 255.  It ahould be noted that in all
three ETA-CRAs, the enrolment of girls was less than 50 per cent
of the appraisal target.  The reasons given for such a low rate of
participation is the unavailability of qualified candidates.

Institut de Techniques Agricolee
6.8        ITA was originally planned to be established at Nkolbisson
but was later transferred to Dschang as a result of presidential
decree No. 77/108 of 28 April 1977, which created the Centre
Universitaire de Dschang (CUD), thus providing the establishment
of ENSA and ITA under one 'umbrella' within the framework of an
agricultural university to be established with assistance provided
by USAID and the Belgian Government.   After a delay of four and a
half years, the project facilities began functioning on 16 October
1985. However, the training programee has continued to be conducted
since ITA's transfer from Nkolbisson to Dschang in 1977 using the
teaching and dormitory facilities provided under USSR bilateral
assistance which was originally intended to train technicians in
agricultural mechanization.   In 1984 and  1985,  161 A.1 and 347 B.l
have  graduated  (Annex  11).    During  1980-1985,  graduate output  is
put at 513 A.l and 648 B.1.
6.9        Although  enrolment  was  foreseen  at appraisal  to be  150
(120  in  agriculture  and  30  in  livestock  streams)  under  the  new
expansion programme of the CUD, it has been increased as follows:

6.10      The increased enrolment initiated by the higher demand for
the Al1 and B1 graduates not foreseen at appraisal was facilitated
by the cancellation of the construction of seven staff houses and
the developmet of a new institute farm (already in existence at
Dsachan) and diverting the funds thus saved for the construction of
additional teaching and boarding facilities (paras. 4.5 and 4.6).
ABU    -IBTA. (iLeld TraInIen  Centre)
6.11      The  Project,  as  foreseen  at  appraisal,  financed  the
construction, furniture and equipment of three field training centres
(Antenne-ITAs) at Bambili,. Ebolowa and Maroua ETA-CUA Campuses.  The
failure on the part of ITA-Dschang to develop and conduct field training
programees, as foreseen at appraisal, is the major reason for the
minimum utilization of the facilities.
The status of the facilities, at present, is as followvs

6.12      At  appraisal,  11.5  man/years  of  specialist  services  were
provided to assist the Ministry of Agriculture ('OA) in planning and
implementing  agricultural  education  prograames.   This  required  the
services of three experts  for each of the three ETA-CRAs.  However,
only one specialist  in each  institution was actually utilized.  This
was mainly due to the Government's reluctance to use consultants during
the  early  stages  of  the  project  implementation.   The  experts  who
specialized in teaching methods and agricultural teacher training,
and teaching materials for agricultural education and extension assisted
in the planning and preparation of ETA-CRA curricula for the B.2, B.1
and C.1 courses and have been in use since the beginning of 1983. These
programmes of studies are due to be discussed and finalized in the
conference for agricultural educators to be organized by the MOA,
shortly.
6.13      The  project  also  provided  technical  assistance  input  for
ITA-Dschang and ENSA, comprising six experts (Annex 12). The performance
of these specialists was considered to be satisfactory with the services
of most of them continued under Government budget.

6.14      1.5 man/years of technical assistance, a fellowship, vehicles
and equipment were provided at appraisal for surveying rural information
needs In specified regions of Cameroon, to improve the rural information
system and to support agricultural extension and other rural activities,
particularly in association with the training programes proposed in
this project.  Ths study would be carried out by the Rural Information
Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture. This project component was never
carried  out  as  planned  at  appraisal.   This  was  undertaken  through
assistance received from the French technical assistance programe (FAC)
at no cost to tho Ministry.  However, the MOA from its own resources
has established a Rural Information Directorate in which the Extension
Service Division  is found.   Regarding  the study on rural activities
in association -ith the training programmes, a survey on the trained
agricultural personnel was undertaken by AFCA under the auspices of
the 'Direction des Etudes et Projets'of the MOA. A draft report, which
is expected to be finalized shortly, contains up-to-date information
on existing trained manpower in agriculture and projections of future
demand, 1985-2000. (Annexes 7 and 8).
Technical Education
Ngacanddrd - Collage d'Enseimneaent Technique Industriel (CCM)
6.15      The mission visited CETI-Ngaound4r4 and found the facilities
provided by the project being over-utilized as regards the academic
accommodation, but under-utilized with respect to dormitory and dining
facilities.  At appraisal, the project provided teaching and dormitory
facilities  for 212 and  125 student  places,  respectively,  (Annex 3).
In 1985, a total of 215 students (21 girls) were enrolled in a four-
year course (Annex 13).  Seventy-seven of the dormitory places provided
are not utilized due to an alleged shortage of funds to provide meals
for students  on campus.  The extension  of the course  to four-years
has resulted in a shortage of classrooms which has forced the conversion
of the drawing, technical and science rooms, and library into permanent
classrooms.  There is an urgent need to expand the metal workshop to
accommodate practical training.
6.16      Future plans for CETI include the admittance of 60 students
annually, giving a total enrolment of 240 students for which additional
facilities will be required.  Links have been established between CETI
and industry as foreseen at appraisal.
6.17      The  programme  of  studies  involves  specialization  in  four
areas  of  study,  namely,  metalwork,  electricity,  automechanics  and
industrial mechanics.  The first year of studv is devoted to providing
refresher courses to students in order to upgrade their knowledge in
the basic relevant science courses. The proportion of practical training
gradually increases from 46 per cent in the first year to 70 per cent
in the fourth year.  As part of the course requirement, students work
in  industrial  enterprises  during  their holiday  period.   The  future
training  programme  to be developed  includes  establishing specialized
training for women in clothing manufaczure, typing and accountancy,
and for men in plumbing and refrigeration.

6.1.8     The  teaching  staff  comprises  23  members  (15  technical
teachers), giving a staff/sjtudent ratio of 1:15 (Annexes 13 and 14).
The qualifications of the teaching staff do not match their areas of
teaching  for general  subjects.    The present  director and more than
50 per cent of the technical teaching staff are provided by PAC, while
the rest comprise nationals (Annex 13).
6.19      According  to  the  Institute,  in  1986  approximately  60 per
cent of the fourth-year students will graduate with diplomas and the
rest with certificates of completion.   It is to be noted that all of
them will be easily absorbed into the labour market, although the latter
(certificate-holders) are more readily acceptable because of the lower
payment they are willing to accept.   The diploma graduates have the
opportunity of continuing higher technical education for three-years
after passing the entrance examination.
Douala CollAge d'Bnseipuemsnt Techbiqe Indlotriel et Commercial (CTIrC)
6.20      The  mission  visited  Douala-CETIC  and  found  the  facilities
provided by the project over-utilized and   without   any   possibility
for expansion.   The  total enrolment of the  institution in 1985 was
1,106, of which 327 were female students as against 790 envisaged at
appraisal (Annex 3). Efforts are being made to gradually lower enrolment
by  reducing  the  annual  intake.   The programme  of studies currently
under review involves seven major subjects in the industrial, and three
in the commercial section.   The teaching content is the same as that
of CETI-Ngaound4re   (para. 6.17).  However, for the commercial section
the  fourth  year  is  devoted  to  specialization.   The  teaching  staff
comprises 58 (five expatriates) as against the 82 total staff required
at the present time. Approximately 50 per cent of the available teaching
personnel are considered to be underqualified (Annex 13).
6.21      The  entrance  recruitmenc  of  students  is highly  selective.
Consequently, out of 4,000 applicants in 1985, only 180 (89 industrial
and 91 commercial) were admitted.  The examination result for the same
year shows an average pass rate of 19 per cent.  Out of a total number
of 261  fourth-year  students  who  sat  for  the qualifying examination
only 49 graduated.   This clearly indicates the poor quality of both
the staff and students, hence, the need to accelerate the revision
of the programme of studies, raising the quality of the teaching staff
as well as lowering the present technical staff/student ratio of 132
to about 1s20 (Annex 13).  Moreover,  it is necessary to increase the
present annual per student budget allocation for teaching materials
from 5,000 CFAF to about 35,000 CFAP, as recommended by the inspectorate
of technical education.
Centre de Saett Ddveloppfs d'Kaeigneienat (CSDE)
6.22      Three  CSDEs  at  Bambili,  Bandengwe and Dibi/Ngaounddrd have
been constructed,  equipped and furnished.   The clinics at Ngaound4re

of project facilities are as shown belows

6.23      The  Clinic  at  Bambili  provides  useful  services  to  the
surrounding  covmunity,   in  spite  of  numerous  problems  involved,
including obstructions on the part of CUSS regarding the use of
equipment provided by the Project.  At Dibi/Ngaounddr4, the training
of para-meds and nurses has begun, owing to the initiative taken
by the provincial health director.
VII. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOIOIKNDATIONS
7.1        In general it is felt that the establishment of the middle-
level   and   higher-level   agricultural   training   institutions   has
considerably expanded the country's capacity to train the required
train manpower.   As  the  recent AFCA agricultural  personnel survey
indicates, the future problem in training agricultural personnel
will not be one of shortage but rather over-production.   The next
step will be to promote the introduction of qualitative improvement
of the training programme and the raising of the level of training
standard.    In   this   respect  the  project   facilities,   if  used
appropriately and wisely, could play an important role in the drive
towards qualitative development.
Agricultural Education and Training
7.2        There seems to exist a proliferation of different levels
of training in agriculture.   Distinction in the levels of training
between A.2 and A.1 as well as between B.2 and B.1 have not been
clearly defined.  Moreover,  judging from the new curriculum financed
by the project, the similarities of the B.2 and B.1 curricula is
so close that their separation does not seem justifiable.   It seems
evident that some changes in the levels of training are inevitable.
The difference between CRA-B.2 and ITA-A.1 training programmes should
be clearly defined.   It would be logical if ENSA undertook the A.1
programme.   The  long-term plan of CUD indicates the transformation
of three-years ITA-A.1 course into a regular four-year degree course
with the fourth year set aside for intensive, practical fieldwork.
This would seem to indicate the possibility of putting into place
a more consolidated first cycle University-level training while
standardizing  the  middle-level  at  two-years  post-Baccalaureat.   It
was further indicated that the second-cycle university training will
start at the M.Sc. level.  The entry requirement would be completion
of the Bac. + four-year (B.Sc.) or A.2 programme (Ingenieur Agronome),
as well as two-years of work experience.
7.3        The  B.2  programme,  Bac.  +  two-years  or post-'A'  level
should  be  developed  into  a  consolidated  middle-level  training
programme.   The  involvement  of  the  Ministry  of Higher Education,
Science and Research in developing the programme would be useful.
The B.1 and C. progtammes should be merged to form a consolidated
lower middle-level technician training programme. The minimum entrance
requirement should be raised to completion probatoire or '0' level
pass  in science subjects.   This lower middle-level training should
be left to the Ministries of Agriculture and Livestock. The projected
graduate demand and output between 1985 and 2000 seems to indicate
over-production in categories B.1 and C. (Annexes 7 and 8). Bence,
the realistic option left is emphasis on qualitative improvement
(paras. 6.1-6.10).



" :t3 -
7.4        Although  provision  has  been  made  at  Board and Council
levels for representation of the Ministries of Agriculture and
Livestock in the Centre Univeraitaire de Dschang, there is a need
to strengthen coordination of activities among these Agencies.
7.S        Cosnuiaeion  between  ITA and  the ETA-CPAs nesds  to be
reinforced.   At  present,  the  Antenne-ITAs  are  hardly  functicning
and there is no free-flow of information among these institutions.
At appraisal, it was foreseen that the ETA and CIA would be
administered by one director, but later the Mlnistry of Agriculture
decided to appoint two directors. This has led to great difficulties
resulting in rivalry in the common use of the project facilities
indicated earlier.   It was suggested  that the appointment of only
one director,  seconded  by  two deputy-directors  (one  for ETA,  the
other for CRA) might resolve the issue in the short term.  Furthermore,
the Ministry of Agriculture should provide clearly defined guidelines
for the ETA and CRA in order to enable the two institutions to utilize
project facilities with maximum efficiency (para. 1.18).
7.6        It has been noted that at Bambili and Ebolowa more thum
50 per cent of the dormitory facilities remain unutilied.  One of
the reasons for this under-utilization is the fact that second-year
students are not obliged to stay on campus.  The Government provides
subsistence  allowance  for students  to obtain meals outside, hence
it  becomes  simpler  for  them  to  live  off-campus;   this  being
particularly true in the case of married students.  It is suggested
that the Ministry of Agriculture should review its policy of paying
students' outside expenses, while project facilities remain under-
utilized (para. 6.6).
7.7        In  general,  the  Project  has  suffered  from  poor  site
selection.  Both Ebolowa and Marous are located in their respective
towns.  Already  their  farmlands  are being parcelled out for other
projects.   Thus,  it  is  strongly  advised  that  the  Ministry  of
Agriculture should take immediate steps in acquiring additional
farmland outside the city limits, before it is too late.  The site
of ITA-Dschang has also the considerable problem of acquiring water
due to its most inconvenient location, situated at the top of a hill
(para. 4.3).
7.8        There  is a need  to adjust  the  School  Calendar  to  the
agricultural production cycles following the planting and harvest
seasons.
7.9        The Centre Universitaire de Dschang should develop coqcrete
plans for the use of the Antenne-ITAs which at the present time are,
for the most part,  idle.  The ETA-CRA Directors have requested the
use of these facilities for the proposed practical training when
the new School Calendar comes into effect.  Although the authorities
in CUD claim that they have plans to use the Antenne-ITAs throughout
the year, there will be scope for working out a programme to
accommodate both institutions (para. 6.11).
Technical Education
7.10 The main issue facing the technical education programme is
the  level  of training  being carried  out.   In retrospect,  it was
unrealistic to expect the training courses to be conducted on a three-
year basis while all other similar institutions keep a four-year



- 24 -
programe.   In any e:ant, organizing a special three-year technical
education  programme would  have  required a presidential decree  for
its implementation.   More important is the level of training which
is given at a relatively younger age (post-primary) in preparation
for the world of work.  At present, graduates of the four-year course
are given the option of continuing their training for another three-
years at higher level, giving a total of seven years training which
is considered  to be costly  and  time-consuming.   A more realistic
option would be to organize a two-year post-lower sczondary technical
education programme which would allow the training of the far more
mature student, ready to enter the world of work (paras. 6.15-6.21).
VIII. LESSONS TO BE LEARMD
General
8.1        The  project  took  nine  and  a  half  years  to  implement.
Although a time overrun of four and a half years was needed to complete
the project, all project components are at nresent established and,
for the most part, functioning.
8.2        One of the important factors that contributed to the delay
of the project execution has been a weakness in project design,
involving five Government agencies in the implementation of the project,
including the Ministries of Education, Higher Education, Agriculture,
Livestock and Public Health.   The Project Implementation Unit  (PIU)
was delegated with the responsibility of putting inte place the
infrastructure, equipment and furniture.   This central position gave
the MOE-PIU almost exclusive power in the decision-making process.
The problem in this respect was particularly felt during the nine
and a half years of implementation, when the PIU was obliged to change
directors  twice,  which resulted  in delays  in decision-making.   The
other ministries were required to second officers to the PIU with
a view to closely follow-up on their respective project components.
However, this arrangement proved to be unsatisfactory. It is advisable
to exercise great caution in future with regard to implementing multi-
dimensional projects involving more than one major agency.
8.3        Closely  aligned  to  the  problem  of  under-representation
of the ministries concerned in the implementation process is the limited
managerial capacity of the Project Implementation Unit, as well as
poor choice of construction firms which undertook contracts to put
up the physical infrastructure.  It is felt that in the early stages
of the project the Bank should have insisted on the selection of firms
whose experience and capacity for project implementation was sound.
In at- least two cases (ITA-Dschang and CSDE-Bandengwe) the contractors,
by failing to meet contract requirements had to be replaced, thus
causing significant delays. The lesson to be learned here is to avoid
delays in the process of payment by strengthening the administrative
capability dealing with disbursement, both in the Ministries of
Education and Finance.



- 25-
8.4        The  delay  in  project  implementation  has  resulted  in
signufic*at financial loss sustained by the Government, due to inflation
and price escalation of building materials antd high labour costs.
The most important contributing factor to this problem is the weakness
of PLU management and organizational structure.  This would seen to
indicate the need for the Government to be totally co idtted to
reorganize the PIU and provide the necessary supporting facilities
including competent and influential management.
Proiect Implemutatiom
8.5        In  two  cases  during  project  implementation,  the  Bank's
guidelines for procurement were not followed, resulting in delays
and cost overrun.   The source of the problem seems to lie in the
Government's apprehension in giving three contracts to a small
construction firm (although offering the lowest bid) for fear of default
and Bank's insistence  in following its guidelines.  It would appear
that there is a need to establish a clear understanding and agreement
in this respect on the part of the Government and the Bank before
starting project implementation.
8.6        Some  of  the  instituAtions  (ETA-CRAs)  were  provided  with
equipment which could not be used due to improper installation and
lack of qualification and orientation on the part of the teachers
and technicians. The PIU and the concerned ministries have to pay
particular attention to assure the availability of qualified personnel
during 4nd after the installation of equipment.
8.7        During  project  preparation,  sufficient  attention  should
have been paid to the use of existing building facilities in order
to avoid wastage of project facilities, as witnessed in ETA-CRA Bambili
where the old dining and kitchen facilities were still being used
while the newly constructed buildings remained idle (Annox I(a)).
Moreover, the selection and survey of project sites should have been
made, taking into consideration the long-term development plans of
the institutions and the surrounding locality.

THIRD EDCATION POJECT CLOA 1246T-W
(a) Architectural  Desim.   All  building  construction  has  concrotg
flooring, concrete block walls, wood or Stoeel roof structure
with  asbestos-cemnt  or corrugated  sheet  roofing.   Landscaping
for Mse of tho school has been well planned and natural
vengtilaeion L sufficient In most of the region, providing good
working conditions.  The electrical network system  did not, in
general, take sutfficiently Into account the pedagogical need
(particularly for CETUC-Dousla and CETI-Ngaounddrd) and additional
work  was  necessary.   Electrical  maintenance,  in  general,  was
poor due to faulty design work.
The design of the building components takes sufficient
account of the general conditions provaillng in the country as
well &a of the specific  conditions of the project areas.  As
was foreseen at appraioal, not all kitchen facllities provided
by the project were in use.  There are several reasons for this
Lncluding  the availability of  funds to purchase gs,  and lack
of knowledge on the part of personnel on the proper use of this
type of equipment.  The result was as observed by the moisson;
none of the inastitutions provided meals for students, who prepared
their own in the corridors of the boarding facilities. The
traditional type of kitchen using wood proved to be move practical,
in most cases. In ETA-CRA Bambili, an existing traditional kitebn
as  well  as  a  dining  hall  and  dormitory  are  in  uses   the
corresponding facilities provided by the project having not,
so far, been utilized.
Design  for  farm  buildings  included  in  the ITA-CRA  are
too  sophisticated  and  costly.   The  facilities provided do not
correspond with those already existing elsewhere and cantot be
used as models for future student practical training progra_es.
Moreover, the facilities are not functional, owing to slippery
floor surfacing due tc absence of barn drainage system for animal
excrement.
(b) Construction.   Due  to  the  failure  of  two  contractors  during
construction period, closed local tendering was organized in
accordance with the Bank guidelines for two institutions (ITA-
Dschang and CSDE-Bandengwe).  At the time of completion of these
institutions,   facilities   were   just   partly   delivered,   end
contractors were on the site financed by the Government.
Construction started on June 1977 for CETIC-Douala, and
from October 1979 to November 1982 for the remaining institution,
with additional contracts in September 1984 for ITA-Dschang and
in February 1985 for CSDE-Ngaounddrd.  Construction was completed
at the end of 1978 for CETtC-Douala. Annex 2 shows the comparison
between appraisal and actual schedule.
The quality of construction of all project components is
satisfactory. Supervision of construction was undertaken jointly
by the consultants and the PtU on the median base of 1.5 times
per month with a local permanent supervision carried out by the
regional  representative  of  the  Ministry  of  Equipment.   Delays
during construction period (for those contracts forecast between
8  and  14  months)  was,  according  to  the  PIU,  due  to  the
unavailability of construction material, transportation diffi-
culties during the rainy season, and problems of payment due
to different appreciations of the monthly situation of work among
contractors, the PIU and local representatives of the Ministry
of Equipment.

PROJECT OPIRATIORAL OUTCOMES
('Ecol, Techabques d'Agiculture' (ITA)
As regards the distribution between practical and theoretical
training, there seems to be a bias towards the latter, with most
of the subjects offered 33 and 35 per cent in the first and second
years,  respectively,  (Annex 6).   This  is partly compensated by the
rural field surveys (stage monographic), and pre-vocational (stage
professional)  studies.    However,  as observed by the mission there
was not much evidence of students' intensive participation in field
activities in ETAs-Ebolowa and -Maroua. Student activities in Bambili,
on the 2ther hand, were impressive.  Each student was provided with
a 600 m plot of land where different varieties of crops were being
produced. In all three ETAs, the workshop and farm facilities provided
by the project were least utilized.  The minimum use of the workshops
is mainly attributed to lack of qualified teaching staff who can
operate workshop equipment, too sophisticated and heavy equipment,
poorly (otherwise well built) designed buildings, shortage or lack
of  working  materials  (this  applies  particularly  to  laboratory
equipment) and a faulty electrical system.
The training of teachers has been a basic handicap Ln the
overall performance of the ETA training programme.  Effort has been
made to upgrade the competence of the teaching staff by organizing
in-service seminars in which the experts provided have made significant
contribution.   To date,  all  31  ETA  teachers  have participated  in
such courses.  Although the Ministry of Agriculture made some effort
in acquiring the National Centre for Studies and Experimentation
in Agricultural Machinery (CENEEMA) to provide specialists to train
the ETA-CRA teaching staff on the use of workshop equipment, it has
not been successful.
The teacher/student ratio was found to be 1:3 for Bambili,
1:5 for Ebolowa and 1:8 for Maroua (para. 6.7).  It is evident that
there is a need to improve the efficiency of the schools in the use
of the teaching staff by maintaining a less numerous, but more
qualified, teaching force.
'Collages RIgionaux d'Agriculture (CRA)
There are two types of training (two-year) undertaken in
the CRAs designed to train two levels of technicians, namely,
Technicien d'Agriculture (TA) cycle B.1, and 'Technicien Principal
d'Agriculture' (TPA)  cycle  B.2.   The  entrance  requirement  of  the
latter is completion of 'baccalaureat' or GCE 'A' level and, for
the former,  'probatoire' or GCE '0' level.  The programme of studies
of these two programmes has been revised with assistance provided
under  the  project  technical  assistance  component.   The  curricula
emphasises practical and field work in the form of agricultural and
sociological regional surveys which require close follow up in the
field by staff members (Annexes 9 and 10).  In the last three years
(1983-1985), 192 B.1 and 122 B.2 levels of technicians have been
trained by the three schools.
