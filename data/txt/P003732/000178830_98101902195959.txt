THE EXECUTIVE DLZECTC-f ON A PROPOSED DEVELOE1IT
CREDIT TO THE REFPULIC OF DIDONIESIA FOR A
WEST JAVA THERMAL POWER PROJECT
1.           I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of
US$46.o million on standard IDA terms to help finance a project for a
thermal power station.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.          The latest Bank report on Indonesia, (Development Issues for
Indomesia, December 1, 1972: R73-6/1) contains a discussion of recent
economic developments, but addresses itself principally to longer-term policy
issues relevant to the Second Plan (197h-78) now in preparation.     Country
data are presented in Annex I.
3.           Indonesia's economic progress over the five years ending 1971
has been satisfactory.    The rate of growth of GDP, averaging 5 percent per
year in 1965-70, reached 6-7 percent in 1971, but was probabl- lower in 1972
when food production, particularly rice, was severely affected by drought.
aice imports to meet the shortages in 1972/73 are estimated at 1.2 million
tons, up from 53O,000 tons in the preceding year.    Mainly as a result of
these shortages the cost of living indexes escalated towards the end of 1972
so that prices at the end of December were 26 percent higher than a year
previously, interrupting the relative price stability achieved and maintained
since 1969.    However, secondary price effects have so far been Limited and
it appears that the prices are beginning to decline.
4.          In the industrial sector,. there has been-further substantial growth
in the production of textiles as well as of other consumer and industrial
goods.   The rehabilitation and expansion of domestic enterprises, backed by
a continuing inflow of private investment and coimitments of official aid for
several major industrial projects, suggests that the prospects are good for
furth,er industrial growth from the present small base. Infrastructure
rehabilitation and expansion is underway, financed in large measure by project
aid, including IDA credits.    Deficiencies in the transport, power and
telecorw:unications sectors, however, could become a constraint on agricultural
and industrial growth unless special efforts are made to accelerate the
implementation on ongoing and future projects.



- 2-
5.        In the public sector, Government revenues in 1971/72 were 20
percent higher than in the previous year.    A much larger increase, in the
order of 45 percent, will be realized in 1972/73. The largest item in this
increase would be taxes on expected higher earnings of foreign oil companies.
Other revenues could increase by up to 20 percent.    The expected increase
in revenues of Rp 160 billion (US$387 million) after financing increases in
salaries and material expenditure in the routine budget, would allow for a
doubling (to Rp 135 billion or US$326 million) of the surplus available
for the development budget.   Together with counterpart funds generated by
program aid (estimated at Rp 97 billion or US$234 million) this provides for
a development budget in 1972/73 of Rp 232 billion (US$560 million), which
is 48 percent more than in 1971/72.
6.        The balance of payments situation has improved steadily.    Exports,
led by oil, have expanded at an unprecedented rate in recent years, but
imports have also risen rapidly.    Recorded exports from Indonesia rose by
over 30 percent in the last two years, and they increased even more in
1972/73, reaching about US$1,935 million, largely as a result of sharp
increases in the volume and value of oil and timber exports.    Foreign
exchange reserves increased rapidly in 1972 from formerly very low levels and on
a net basis reached $285 million at the end of December 1972.   Gross
reserves then amounted to $489 million, equi-.alent to about three months of
total imports at 1972/73 rates and an increase of $345 million in the year.
The change was caused by increased capital inflows including growth in the
amounts of private capital attracted by high Indonesian interest rates, in
the utilization of foreign loans by state enterprises, and in direct
foreign investment.
7.        The Government is now in the process of assessing Indonesia's past
Terformance and future economic potential as part of its pro"ec   onQ c-v"he
Second Plan.   This Plan will address more directly than was possible in the
rehabilitation phase the issues of employment, income distribution and regional
development.   Although the ability of the Indonesian Government to formulate
and implement plans, programs and projects has improved, limited managerial
capacity presents a serious obstacle to more rapid growth.    This prcblem as
well as the continued need to Liprove the mobilization of domestic savings,
will also have to be considered in the formulation of the Plan.
8.        Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is a part of the international
support being given in increasing amounts through the IC3I.    Aid commitments
have risen from less than US$200 million equivalent in 1967 to over USSi50
million for 1971/72.    The proportion of project aid has steadily increased
over this period, but substantial program aid rernains es5ential as support
for the balance of paynents and - in spite of strong dormstic revenue
efforts - as a source of additional funds for the development budget.    For
1972/73, express or implied co-mitments made by IGGI mer -ers amounted to some
US$724 million equivalent, of which US$320 million was for program aid,
including US$110 million in food supplies.    In December 1972, the IGGI met
to consider a request for $760 million in new coimiitmrents of project and program



-3-
aid in 1973/74, and accepted this as reasonable and realistic in terms of
Indonesia's needs.
9.        The soft average terms of foreign assistance in the IGGI framework,
and the rescheduling of pre-1966 external debt obligations (under the 1970
Paris Club agreement with the Western countries and Japan and parallel
arrangements with several Eastern European countries) have kept Indonesia's
public debt service ratio relatively low, currently at about 11 percent of
exports.   The capacity to service external debt will, however, continue to
be limited by the size of investment income transfers arising from foreign
investment in oil, hard minerals, forestry and manufactu.ring which amounted
to 14 percent of exports in 1972 and will increase substantially through the
1970's.   The maintenance of low official debt service ratios during the
decade will depend on the continued availability of conzessional aid, restraint
on short and medium term foreign borrowing not directly related to export growth,
and the further substantial increases in exports which are now projected.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERAITIONS IN
INDONESIA
10.       In order to accelerate the pace of economic development, Indonesia
will require substantial external support for rehabilitation and improvement
of infrastructure and expansion of production capabilities in agriculture,
minerals, forestry and manufacturing.    It will also require continued
strengthening of the institutions for the planning of development and the
management of the economy.   Welfare and income distribution, family planning,
as well as regional development and related patterns of employment and
population movements, also need to be given an important place in Indonesia's
development strategy.
11.        The work of both the Resident, Staff in Indonesia and at Headc!-urters
and the lending activities of the Bank Group have been o 'cnted tow-r-d  thesc
development objectives.   The focus of the Bank's econom-Lc work in providing
assistance to the Government in the current preparation of Indonesia's next
five-year plan is also along these lines.
12.        Consistent with Indonesia's low per capita incc-ae, large external
resource requirements and difficult balance of payments problems, the Bank
Group's lending to Indonesia (aside from IFC investments) has been and will
probably continue in the foreseeable future to be in the form of DA credits.
In recognition of the urgent need for institutional refo::.is, most IDA-financed
projects have been associated with major reorganizations of existing
institutions or the establishment of new ones, and rmost c-edits have included
appropriate provision for consultant services.



13.       To date, Indonesia has received 26 IDA credits amounting to
US$341.5 million.   Annex II contains a summary statement of IDA credits
and IFC investments as of March 31, 1973 and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.   The composition of this lending reflects the priorities
for rehabilitation and development established by the Government.
14.       In order to assist the rehabilitation and development of the
agricultural sector, credits have been extended for the Government estates
sector, irrigation systems, a seed multiplication program, fisheries,
livestock, smallholder rubber production and the PUSRI fertilizer plant.
Other priority sectors to which credits have also been extended include
highways, telecommunications, industry, education and population.    In
addition, three technical assistance credits have been made to finance
pre-investment studies undertaken by the Government, which have helped to
establish investment priorities over a wide range of activities, and other
urgently needed technical assistance.    Credits to finance projects for
smallholder and private estates tea development, sugar industry rehabilitation,
and an industrial estate, are expected to be presented to the Executive
Directors in the next several months.    Projects in irrigation, telecommunications,
and railways are under preparation.
15.       The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in September 1968, and
19 of the 26 credits have been made since July 1970.    The program is thus
new, and the undisbursed portion of the credits is therefore relatively large.
Virtually every credit has been associated with extensive institutional
reforms involving, inter alia, the creation of new project authorities,
drafting of new charters, and enactment of new legislation, all of which have
taken, in most cases, much time.    Several credits - including the first two
for agricultural estates projects - have experienced delays in disbursement
because of management problems (Annex II).
16.       Both because of the limited absorption capacity of project agencies
and the need in the initial stages of lending to Indonesia to assist in a
number of sectors, IDA lending was spread over a relatively large number of
fairly small projects.   Now that the program has substantially expanded, our
assistance will concentrate on consolidating what has already been started
through a smaller number of larger loans to project entities already familiar
with Bank Group procedures.    This consolidation is expected to reduce the
Government's needs to staff new or substantially reorganized project agencies
and to make more manageable the 3ank's responsibility for supervising projects
in Indonesia.



PART III - THE ELECTRIC POWER SECTOR
Background:
17.         Until the recent past the Indonesian power system consisted of
small, scattered generators for lighting purposes and non-standardized
transmission facilities owned and operated commercially by private Dutch
companies or by Government.   Through most of the 1950's electricity was
available only in the main cities.   Industrial power requirements were small
and sectoral expansion and inprovement in general was slow.   During the
mid-1950's private electric companies were nationalized and responsibility
for public power was given to the Ministry of Public Works and Electric Power.
New and inexperienced management, inadequate financial planning and control,
and a shortage of foreign exchange for procurement of spare parts led to
serious deterioration of plant and equipment.   This situation coupled with
a growing residential and industrial demand for power in the 1960? s and only
modest increases in publicly generated power resulted in grossly irnadequate
public service and substantial private investment in "captive" generating
plant and equipment.
PLN:
18.         In 1965 Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara (FLN) was created as the
national electricity authority.   Until recently it has operated under the
authorization of a body of laws relating to Government agencies and enterprises
in general, and a 1965 Government decree concerning it specifically, making
PLN part of the Ministry of Public 'Works and Electric Power.  However,
within the Ministry, responsibility for Dlanning and new construction rested
with the Directorate General of Power and in some cases PLN did not even own
the plants which it had to operate and maintain.
19.         With technical assistance provided under Credit No. 165-IND, a
new charter for PLN was drafted, agreed with the Association and put into
effect in June 1572.   The new charter gives PLN the right and responsibility
to generate, transmit and distribute electric power and to construct, own and
operate all public sector generating plants and power networks in accordance
with sound public utility and commercial practice.   The charter specifies that
PLN will recommend appropriate tariffs to the Ministry of Public Works for
approval by the President of the Republic, and that tariffs should be
sufficient to produce revenues to cover all operating expenditures including
depreciation, debt service  in excess of depreciation and taxes, and to provide
a surplus for financing a reasonable portion of PLN's development program.
As described in paragraph 33 it will be some time before PLN will be able to
comply with this provision of its charter.
Present Facilities and Expected Growth:
20.        Power sales in Indonesia have grown at an increasing rate, starting
at about f'our percent per annum in 1968, and increasing to about twelve percent
in 1971.   West Java, inclading Jakarta  where the proposed Project is located,
accounts for roughly 50% of FLN's total sales.   The power sales growth rate for
this region has increased from about 2% in 1968 to 16% in 1971 without major
improvements in the distribution system.   The distribution rehabilitation and
expansion program for Jakarta financed under Credit Nos. 165 and 334-IND will
encourage higher consumption and further increases in power demand.   Already
applications for new connections in Jakarta, amounting to about 300NVA, have been
filed, of which only a part can be processed in the near future.



- 6 -
21.     'Throughout Incdonesia PLN' s generating plant and cListribution network are
inadequate and unreliable and have induced a large number of domestic and
industrial users to establish their own generating plant. An estimated
450MW or 37 percent of total installed capacity is generated by such
"captive" plants. Of the total generating capacity available to PLN
(782 MW) 40 percent consists of hydroelectric units, 29 percent steam
units, 26 percent diesel engines and 5 percent gas turbines. PLN's
transmission facilities total about 3,000 km of lines ranging from
25 kV to 150 kV and aggregate transformer capacity is about 1,350 MVA.
Major industrial and residential communities are not adequately inter-
linked and PLN continues to operate many small systems on an isolated
basis.
22.        Over the next 7 to 10 years an overall power sales increase of
about 14% per annum can be expected for Indonesia.    However, power demand and
sales in West Java are expected to grow by 17% to 20% annually. While forecasts
in a developing country with a low consumption base are subject to many
uncertainties, a growth rate of this magnitude is considered reasonable for
planning purposes.   It is therefore estimated that about 150-200 KW of
additional generating capacity are needed in West Java to provide a reliable
power supply prior to commissioning of the proposed project in 1977.     Installa-
tion of gas turbines presents the only possibility of obtaining this increase
in generating capacity in such a short time and PLN is seeking and has already
received some bilateral financial assistance for purchase of this equipment.
With completion of the proposed project in 1977 sufficient base load capacity
will be economically available and the gas turbines could either serve as peaking
and reserve capacity or could be transferred to other regions.
Previous IDA Lending to PLN:
23..   In Qoctober 1969, the Association extended a Credit of US$15 million
equivalent (Credit No. 165-IND) for the first stage of a program to rehabilitate
and expand the Jakarta electricity distribution system and for consulting
services to assist PLN to improve its organization and mana,ement.   A
thorough review by consultants of system requirements, planning policies,
standards of services and design prac-tices, as well as PLN's responsibi-
lities and organization, provided the basis for the second phase of the
program for which a credit of US$40 million equivalent (Credit No. 334-IND)
was approved by the Execuitive Directors in June 1972 and, when funds from
the Third IDA Replenishment became available, was sicned on September 29,
1972.
2 4.      The Project Agreement of Credit No. 334-ITNT required PLN to
implement new tariffs by January 1, 1973.   A few days before this date
PLN informed the Association that it could not implement new tariffs by
the required dat,e and the terminal date for effectiveness of the Credit
was therefore postponed. The Credit was declared effective March 12,
1973 after the Governient gaw the Association an assurance that a thirty
percent avera;ze tariff increase wouald be introduced on July 1, 1973.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The proposed project would include construction of the 200 MW
Muara Karang thermal station, located on the outskirts of Jakarta,with
associated transmission and substation facilities to connect the station
with PLN's grid for Jakarta,and West Java. The proposed project also
includes funds for a Java Power System Development Study and a feasibility
study of the Citarum Hydroelectric Project. In addition, as a part of
theproposed project PLN would undertake a comprehensive financial
recovery plan (see paragraphs 35 to 37).
26.       In the Muara Karang station the first two 100 MW units of an
eventual capacity of 400-500 MW would be installed. The oil-fired boilers
would have burners adjustable for gas-fuel operation in case natural gas
becomes economically available. Each generator would be linked through
a 115 MVA transformer to a 150 kVswltchyard. The station's output would
be transmitted to PLN's grid over about 30km of double circuit lines to
three existing substations, which would be upgraded to 150-70 kV as
required.
27.       No major ecological problems are expected.  Cooling water from
the condensers will be discharged directly into the Java Sea where there
is ample cooling water available. With the use of electrostatic preci-
pitators and low-sulphur Indonesian oil atmospheric contamination could
easily be kept below unacceptable levels. In any event, the terms of
reference for the engineering consultants explicitly stipulate that
ecological investigations will be undertaken and recommendations made on
the preventive measures required.
28.       The Power System Development Study would involve preparation
of a power system development plan for Java including determination of
long-term investment priorities in the power sector. The Citarum
Hydroelectric Feasibility Study would investigate a potential hydro power
site on the Tarum river about 100 km from Jakarta. The first phase of
the study would determine the scope of a possible project in relation to
system needs and economy. Depending on first phase findings, physical
investigations and preliminary designs for a project would be included
in a second phase of the study.
Project Costs:
29.      Total project costs are estimated at US $54.6 million equivalent.
The proposed US$46 million IDA credit, equivalent to 84 percent of project
costs, would cover the foreign exchange costs.   The balance of project costs
woulc. be financed by the Government from budgetary resources.   The Java System
Development Study and Citarum Hydroelectric Feasibility Study would be executed
under separate contracts by consultants and PLN's staff would be involved to
the extent possible for trairing purposes.

Procurement and Disbursement:
30.       Goods and services required for the project, includinc civil
works contracts,would be procured through international competitive bid-
ding in accordance with the Association's Guidelines for Procurement.
Qualified domestic manufacturers would be granted the standard margin
of preference. In the bids for major equipment PLN plans to ask for an
option on an additional 100 IvI unit to be installed later. The proposed
Credit would be disbursed against the foreign exchange costs of consul-
tants' services and the c.i.f. costs of imported equipment and materials,
or 95 percent of the ex-factory price of locally produced goods. Sixty-
one percent of total costs, the estimated foreign excharln e coil-ronent,
would be disbursed against the civil xorks costs of the therrrmal station.
Because of the sever e power shortages in the Jakarta area it is important
that detailed engineering for the projecv begin as soon as possible and
invitations were therefor e sent in early 15'73 t-lo a number of qualifi ed
firms among which PLN will select one with the Pissociation's concurrence.
It is intended that the proposed Credit would finance expenditures for
detailed en-ineering incurred prior to Credit signin-; these should not
exceed US$100,000 equivalent.
PN i's Financial Situation:
31.        When Credilt No. 165-IND was extended ir. l96, meaningful information
on PLN's financial position was not available.   Power sales records were
either non-exdstent or unreliable; billing ard collection procedures were
inadequate; large amounts were owed PLN by CGovemrnent agencies and inccone
and financial statements were inaccurate.   With the assistance of



- 9 -
management and accounting consultants financed by the Credit, training
of PLN's personnel at headquarters and in key Java Exploitasi (districts
of operation) was begun and revaluation of assets and preparation of
reliable financial statements for 1971 (the year in which asset revaluation
would be completed) was given highest priority.
32.        By the time Credit No. 334-IND was presented to the Executive
Directors the consultants had created the basis for a sound accounting
system for PLN, started a systematic on-the-job training program, drafted a
new charter which was implemented with the Association's concurrence and
nearly completed the valuation of fixed assets and a tariff review.    While
information on PLN's financial condition was still very uncertain at the
time, the President's Report for Credit 334 indicated that PLN could be
expected to break-even about 1975 and might begin financing a portion of its
development from earnings in 1976.
33.       At the time of appraisal of the proposed project,when reliable
financial data were available for the first time, it became apparent that
PLN's financial situation was worse than had been thought earlier. In
1971 PLN's revenues covered only 76 percent of operating costs (including
depreciation) and preliminary figures for 1972 indicate that revenues
may not have covered even cash operating costs. A conventional perform-
ance covenant, such as is contained in PLN's charter and the Project
Agreement for Credit No. 334-IND, requiring cost coverage and a contribu-
tion to investment, clearly cannot be complied with in the near future.
34.       In part PLN's poor financial position is the result of circum-
stances beyond its control. A large and widely scattered system of non.-
standardized, old and inefficient generating plants and inadequate distri-
bution and substation facilities results in high operation costs and
allows few econories of scale. Moreover, a sharp deterioration of PLN's
financial position in 1972 was largely tYe result of a serious drought
which, accompanied by initial operating difficulties with a new thermal
plant in Jakarta, caused a serious power shortage -and drastically reduced
sales in West Java, PLN's largest market.  However, PLN's weak financial
situation is primarily the result of inadequate tariffs and high operating
costs caused by excess and untrained personnel, poor cost management and
high system losses.
Financial Recovery Plan:
35.       To improve PLN's financial situation the Governrment and PL!
agreed during negotiations that, in implementing7 the proposed project,
PLN would formulate and execute a comprehensive financial recovery plan
which would cover all aspects of its administration and operations and
would be desi-ned to enable it to break-even during its fiscal year
beginning April 1978.   Specifically, the Government and PLN have agreed



- 10 -
to take all steps necessary to ensure that PLN's revenues from its sales
of electricity would, by 1978/79, fully cover operating costs, including
adequate provision for depreciation and bad debts, as well as taxes and
interest if any. The plan woluld encompass and involve improvements in
all aspects of PLN's planning, finance  and personnel  management and
training, as well as construction, operation and maintenance of generating
plants, transmission and distribution systems. For the purpose of carry-
ing out the financial recovery plan PLN will employ management consultants
(whose services are financed under Credit No. 33h-IND) to assist it in
planning and implementing detailed annual programs of measures, satis-
factory to the Association, designed to ensure adequate progress  toward
financial recovery during each fiscal year. Moreover, the annual
programs willbe designed to enable PLN to reach revenue/cost ratios of
80 percent in 1974/75 and 90 percent in 1976/77 and PUT has agreed that
it shall make all efforts to reach these intermediate target ratios as
an appropriate indication of the due diligence which it exercises in
achieving full financial recovery. PLN will also review and assess with
the Association, at semi-annual intervals, the actual progress made
toward achieving financial recovery and for this purpose semi-annual
supervision missions are planned.
36.        To prepare and implement its recovery plan and the annual
programs of measures PLN will have to depend heavily on the continuing
assistance and advice of its management consultants.   During negotiations
for the proposed Credit,agreerment was reached among the Association, the
Government and PLN (assisted by its consultants) on detailed terms of
reference for the consultants' services and an implementation schedule for a
considerable number of specific activities which will form the basis of the
annual programs and the recovery plan.   Because the work outlined in the
terms of reference is essential if PLN is to improve its operations and because
it is urgent that the work begin as soon as possible, conclusion of all
contractual arrangements for these services is a condition of effectiveness
of the proposed Credit.
37.       Durin7 the early years of the recovery period PLN may suffer a
shortage of cash and therefore be unable to meet its operating obligations.
The Government therefore has agreed to make effective arrangements to sup-
plement, on reasonable terms, PLUI's resources with sufficient liquid funds
as needed to pay all its debts from administration and operations within
a month of the due dates. All other funds which the Governrment makes
available to PIFI, including the proceeds from the proposed Credit and all
funds for PIFU's capital investment program, would continue to be in the
form of equity since FLN will not be in a position to service debt until its
financial situation has improved.



Project Justification:
38.       The power sector is an important one for Indonesia's future
development and the Government recognizes the importance of PLN develop-
ing into a sound organization and achieving financial recovery. The
additional generating capacity which would be financed under the project
is urgently needed in the Jakarta area. The proposed project with units
of 10OMW is the least cost solution to provide the additional capacity
for discount rates from aboutlO to 30 percent. A station with units of
10OMW would be technically suitable for PLN to operate as it represents
the upper size limit of non-reheat units which PLN could operate without
difficulty.  The economic returnof the project is estimated at 20 percent
and is satisfactory.  Should load growth prove lower than currently esti-
mated, there would be less need for the interim investments which PLN
must make for gas turbines. The return on the project would not be affected
significantly because of the badly needed base load capacity.
39.       While PLN's financial position remaina ve&akits efforts, with
the assistance of its consultants, and its success in establishing the
institutional and organizational basis for future financial recovery have
been considerable.   What remains to be done is essentially implementation of
the consultants' proposals and intensive training of all levels of staff.
This will require a number of years.   The financial recovery plan, which
has been worked out with PLN and the Government as a part of the proposed
project, provides a goal to which FLN with the Government's support is
committed.   The requirement to formulate and agree with the Association the
annual program of specific and practical measures to improve operations
and cut costs provides a mechanism by which the Association can assist and
encourage PLN, through close supervision, to move as rapidly as possible
toward financial recovery.   When the Muara Karang station comes into operation
in 1977, sales of its power will make a substantial contribution to PLN's
earnings and, with continued assistance from the Association, the company
has a reasonable prospect of achieving full financial recovery by 1978/79.
In the exceptional circumstances of this case, I am therefore prepared to
recommend further financing for PLN despite the fact that it will take longer
to achieve financial recovery than had previously been expected.
PART VI - LEGAL INSTRUMINTS AND AUTHORITY
40.        The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Indonesia and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between
Perusahaan Umum Listrik Negara and the Association, the Recommendation of the
Committee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of
Agreement of the Association, and the text of a resolution approving the proposed
Credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.   The
draft Agreements conform to the normal pattern for credits for public utility
projects.
41.        I a-i satisfied that thc proposed Development Credit would comply
with the Irticles of Agreement of the Association.

C.           PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Cr. No. 127  Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$5.0 Million Credit of September 6,
196d;  Closing Date: June 30, 1974,
This US$5.0 million credit was the first for irrigation rehabilitation
in Indonesia. It covers 201,000 ha. All the equipment supplied under the Credit
is being well utilized and disbursements are 98 percent of estimates made at the
time of appraisal. The bulk of the cost of the project is being borne by GOIo
Final completion of the project is expected to be delayed by about two years in
order to complete much needed drairiage work, wfhich was not included in the original
schedule. The economic rate of returin (ERR), which was calculated as 50 percent at
appraisal, has been re-worked to allow for actual schedule and costs; it is 25
percent.
Cr. No. 135 Technical Assistance; US$2.0 Million Creclit of December 27, 1968;
Closing Date:  January 31, 1974.
The preinvestment studies financed by this credit are progressing
satisfactorily and the credit is nearly fully committed. In order to complete
disbursements for ongoing studies; we have recently agreed to postpone the closing
date    for one year, to January 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 154 Highways; US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31 1973.
This credit finances equipment for highhway maintenance and a specific
highway rehabilitation program. Initial delays in project execution arose from
the unfamiliarity of the Indonesian officials with Bank procurement procedures
and administrative inefficiencies in disbursement of local funds. The project
is now progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates; US$16 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Clog_ Date:    June 3O,97.
This project is about one year behind its original schedule due to
delay in appointing management advisors and visiting inspectors. The project
also suffers from weak management and inadequate Governmernt control of the estates
involved. The Govermaent is reviewing the findings of a management survey report
(financed under Credit No. 216) covering all Government agricultural estates,
and as a first step, is introducing improved systems of management control and
cost accounting on the estates.   The Covernment is discussing with the Association
further steps necessary to improve the management of the estates.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regardin- the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understandinm; that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Cr. No. 165   Electricity Distribution:  US$15 Million Credit of October 29,
1969;  Closing Date:  December 31, 1973.
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 193   PTJSRI Fertilizer Expansion:  US$30 Million Credit of June 15,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Implementation of this project began nearly a year later than anti-
cipated in the appraisal report because of the time required to meet all the
conditions of effectiveness, to select contractors on bid specifications accep-
table to all co-lenders, and to negotiate contracts satisfactory to all parties.
Since the conclusion of the contracts, Part I (construction of an ammonia-urea
fertilizer complex with an annual capacity of 380,000 metric tons of urea) has
progressed well and the contractors, spurred on by a penalty-bonus arrangement,
are now ahead of the new schedule. Part II (construction and installation of a
natural gas gathering system and a 65-mile transmission line to the fertilizer
complex for use as feedstock and fuel and to serve other industrial users) has
also suffered delays, but the construction contract has been awarded and the
system is now expected to be completed by February 1974, when the fertilizer
plant needs gas for plant testing.
Current estimates of capital cost show an increase of about 25
percent over the appraisal report figures. Part I shows an increase of 17 per-
cent, due to currency revaluations and changes made necessary as detailed design
progressed and the true conposition of the gas supply became known.  Part II
has been enlarged to increase transmission of gas, in part to meet the increased
needs of the fertilizer complex but also to supply a greatly increased usage by
PertariLina for its refineries and by power plants.  This has increased the cost
of Part II by about 78 percent, but has lowered the cost of gas to the fertilizer
complex since the system throughput has been increased by 104 percent.
Current estimates indicate that these factors will result in in-
creased foreign exchange costs of US$20.2 million equivalent, including contin-
gencies and a potential bonus for the general contractor if he completes the
facilities ahead of the agreed schedule.   AID and OECF have agreed to contri-
bute $4.O million and $4.5 million respectively to help finance the foreign
exchange cost overrmu, and the Association has submitted to its Ececutive
Directors a proposal to inicrease Credit No. 193-IND from $30.0 mfllion to
$35.0 million. The Government will cover the balance required to complete both
parts of the project.
Despite the capital cost increase, the Froject has become more
remunerative.  The economic rate of return has increased from ]h to 21 percent
and, because of recent market developments a faster build-up of sales and
higher market prices can be expected than assumed in the appraisal report.

Cr, No. 194   Agricultural Estates II:   US$17 Million Credit of June 1, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Comments on the progress of this project are the same as those
on Credit 155-IND above. The managerial problems, however, are not so acute.
Cr. No. 195   Irrigation Rehabilitation II:   US$1865 l.1lion Credit of June 15,
1970; Closing Date: Novemiber 30, 1976.
This US$18.5 million credit is the second irrigation rehabilitation
project in Indonesia. It includes rehabilitation and drainage works for 186,000 ha.
After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of tender documents and diffi-
culties in obtaining acceptable bids, work is now proceeding somewhat better.
Although problems of quality and progress still exist, if good contractors bid and
win the awards on the last two (and largest) contracts, for which bids will open
shortly, the project could still be completed on schedule. There are no serious
cost overruns in the overall project.   Disbursements are picking up but are still
slow and, at December 31, 1972, were only 43 percent of the estimate shown in the
appraisal report.
Cr. No. 210  Telecommunications Expansion;   US$12.8 Million Credit of July 13,
1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1974.
After a slow start due to procurement difficulties the project is
now progressing satisfactorily.   Orders for all equipment, except the tropospheric
scatter system, have been placed. The management consultants retained to study
the telecommunications authority and recommend remedial measures have completed
their work and have also been retained to implement the recommendations.
Cr. No. 211 Fisheries; US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
This project is about 18 months behind the original implementation
schedule and disbursements are low. The principal cause for the delay has
been the unsatisfactory management and engineering, assistance. Arrangements
with new engineering consultants have been concluded and proposals for improved
management assistance to the project are beinF considered by the Government.
Prospects for successful project imiplementation remain good.
Cr. No. 216 Technical Assistance II; US$4.0 Million Credit of September 1,
1970;  Closing Date:   December 71, 1973.
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 219 Education: US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 1976.
Implementation of this project fell a year behi-:d schedule due to
delays in the Government's evaluation of consultants and to -ancertainties regarding
the liability of foreign contractors and consultants for Indonesian incone tax.
A contract with consultants was signed in June 1971, and the project is now
progressing satisfactorily.

Cr. Nb. 220   Irrigation Rehabilitation III:  US$14.5 Million Credit of November 6,
1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975.
This US[14.5 million credit is the third irrigation rehabilitation
project in Indonesia, It covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabilitation and re-
introduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systems, two in Java
and one in South Sulewesi. Construction is presently behind schedule due to prob-
lems with preparation of contract documents, a slow start in civil works contracts,
and the over-extention of the few experienced local contractors brought about by
the large volume of construction work in Indonesia. Some improvements in the rate
of execution are expected, but it is still estimated that the project's completion
date will be between two and three years behind that anticipated at appraisal.
Overall project cost estimates have increased by 15 percent. The Government has
made arrangements to meet this cost overrun. Disbursements are 50 percent below
the level estimated at appraisal but are now picking up.   Sensitivity tests run
at the time of appraisal showed that with a two-year delay in the project and a
15 percent overall cost overrun the economic rate of return (ERR) would drop from
25 percent to 21 percent.
Cr. No. 246   Seeds:  US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;  Closing Date:
September 30, 1977
Progress of this project has been hampered by delays in the pro-
vision of funds by the Government and by slow procurement of equipment. The
last supervision mission reported that these problems are being overcome but
that project costs are likely to be higher than appraisal report estimates due
to delays in execution and international exchange rate adjustments. This matter
is currently being discussed with the Government and will be reviewed in detail
by a supervision mission scheduled for early summer, when cost information will
be more complete.
Cr. No. 259   Tea: US$15.0 MIillion Credit of June 24, 1971;  Closing Date:
June 30, 197T.
This project is progressing satisfactorily, though overall streng-
thening of estate management is required for the reasons set out under Cr. 194 above.
Cr. No. 260   Highways II:  US$34.0 MIillion Credit of June 24, 1971;  Closing Date:
September 30, 1975.
Progress on this project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 275   Technical Assistance III: US.4.0 Million Credit of December 29, 1971;
Closing Date:  March 31, 1974.
Progress on this project is satisfactory.
Cr. No. 288   Education II: US$6.3 Million Credit of March 9, 1972;   Closing Date:
December 31, 1976.
Progress on this project is satisfactory.
