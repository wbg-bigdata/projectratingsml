MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
FOR THE BEILUNGANG THERMAL POWER EXTENSION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the People's Republic of China to help finance the Beilungang Thermal Power
Extension Project, is submitted for approval. The loan for $165.0 million
would have a term of 20 years, including 5 years of grace, at the standard
variable interest rate. The proceeds of the loan would be onlent to the
Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power Bureau (ZPEPB) under a subsidiary loan
agreement with a 20-year term, including 5 years of grace, at a variable
interest rate equal to that of the Bank. The foreign exchange risk between
the dollar and local currency will be borne by ZPEPB.
2.        Background.  Inadequacies in electric generating capacity have been
a major constraint on China's economic growth in the past. This situation is
likely to be continued in the near term. The Government gives high priority
to electric power development, with a strategy that combines (a) expanding
generating capacity by developing coal-fired thermal stations at mine-mouths
and near ports and load centers and accelerating the pace of hydroelectric
development; (b) increasing the financial and management autonomy of the power
bureaus; (c) introducing a more rational pricing system; (d) adopting modern
techniques in project design and system planning including environmental
aspects; (e) constructing extra high voltage transmission lines for
interconnection between regions; and (f) re'tacing low pressure medium size
(50-100 MW) thermal units by higher pressure 300-600 MW units and converting
oil-fired units to coal-fired.
3.        There are seven-major regional grids that account for about 80X of
total eeneration, which are managed by electric power administrations under
the supervision of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power (MWREP).
Thirty percent out of the total installed capacity is hydro and 70Z thermal.
4.        Of the seven major regional Grids, the East China Regional Grid is
by far the largest and suffers the most acute shortages of electricity. The
Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power Grid is one of the most important grids
covered by the Regional Grid. The rapid growth in industrial, agricultural
and municipal uses in Zhejiang province has exceeded generation and trans-
mission capacity, requiring restricted power use within the Province.  These
restrictions have severely curtailed industrial production, and, because the
Regional Grid as a whole is short of power, it is unable to supply the addi-
tional power needed to support this industrial production. Therefore, to
alleviate the acute power shortages and meet the expected demand in the early
1990s, there is an urgent need to expand generation and transmission capacity
in Zhejiang.
5.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The Bank is supporting major ele-
ments in the Government's power strategy by so far financing six power pro-
jects. The major thrust of Bank assistance has been to introduce modern
concepts of utility management, and power system technology including



-2 
environment assessment and pollution control; international competitive
bidding; modern construction techniques in complex hydroelectric projects
(Lubuge, Yantan and Shuikou); technology transfer in the fields of extra high
voltage transmission lines and large, coal-fired thermal power stations of
300 MW and 600 MW units; and system planning techniques including least-cost
investment planning. The Bank also has been instrumental in the undertaking
of a tariff study, has systematically strived towards strengthening financial
planning and management capabilities of the power bureaus, and has recently
initiated a second set of sector studies with the Government involving
organizational and regulatory policies, load forecasting and planning, and
transmission strategy. The tariff study has been successfully completed. On
the basis of the tariff study the Bank will explore with GOC how to formulate
the first major tariff adjustment in the context of China's overall price
reform process.
6.       The proposed project would be the second project involving the
Beilungang thermal power plant. The first project, which was approved by the
Bank on May 29, 1986 (Loan 2706-CHA), is under construction and proceeding
well. It was originally expected that the second unit (600 MW) would be
financed with commercial/export credits on favorable terms; however, the
results 'of an optional bidding on the second unit did not produce financing
packages that were any more favorable than what China was obtaining under
other power projects without Bank assistance. The external debt situation for
the power subsector as a whole in 1987 was very tight; the Government is
financing ten other thermal power projects in the Seventh Five-year Plan with
about US$1.5-1.8 billion in supplier's credits. As a result, the Government
has 'clamped-down' on further supplier's credit borrowing in the sector.
During the annual review meeviUg with the Bank in October 1987, the Government
requested the Bank's assistance for financing the second unit. Since GOC is
determined to reorganize the power subsector in China and plans to begin
changing ZPEPB into a power company as one of the first test cases for
increased autonomy, the proposed project would allow the Bank to deepen its
involvement in the reform process of power entities in China by providing a
wider range of technical assistance focused on ZPEPB's reorganization and
management improvement.
7.       Project Objectives.  The proposed project seeks to:  (i) alleviate
the acute power shortage of a major load center in East China; (ii) support
the national policies of developing large coal-fired thermal power generating
units to make effective use of China's abundant coal reserves; (iii) continue
the effort to introduce the modern technology in plant design and construction
management of 600 MW thermal power units; and (iv) provide technical
assistance to,ZPEPB for reorganizing its operations and strengthening its
management. This assistance will facilitate its transformation from a power
bureau to a more autonomous power entity.
8.       Project Description.  The proposed project is located about 25 km
east of the city of Ningbo at Beilungang sea port in Zhejiang Province. The
project would extend the Beilungang thermal plant by adding a second unit of
600 MW at a site being developed (first unit of 600 MW scheduled for commis-
sioning in 1990). In addition, the project includes construction of a second
single circuit of 500 kV transmission line and extension of a substation;
provision of consulting services for engineering and procurement; provision of
technical assistance for a study on ZPEPB's reorganization and management



-3-
improvement; a study for exterding and improving the distribution networks for
the cities of Hangzhou and Wing.o; and a training program.
9.        The project would be carried out by ZPEBP over five years and would
cover funds for civil works, equipment and materials, technical assistance,
and training. The total financing requirement of the project is estimated at
US$289.7 million equivalent (including interest during construction), with a
foreign exchange component of US$199.7 mil'lion (69%). A breakdown of costs
and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are given in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in China are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
A map showing project locations are also attached. The Staff Appraisal
Report, No. 7164-CHA, dated May 12, 1988, is being distributed separately.
10.       Agreed Actions.  Assurance has been obtained at neeotiations:
(a) from the Government that it will: (i) onlend the proceeds of the loan to
ZPEPB on terms satisfactory to the Bank (see para. 1); and (ii) take into
account the results of the tariff study carried out under the Beilungang
Thermal Power Project (Loan 2706-CHA)'in determining the levels and structures
of ZPEPB's-electricity tariffs; (b) from ZPEPB that it will: (i) take mea-
sures, including but not limited to tariff adjustments, to ensure that
annually it earns cash surpluses sufficient to meet a minimum of 12.5% of its
annual investment program for the period 1988-90, a minimum of 201 of its
annual investment program for the period 1991-93, and a minimum of 25% of its
annual investment program thereafter; (ii) incur additional debt only if a
reasonable forecast of its revenues and expenditures indicates that internal
cash generation would provide debt service coverage of not less than 1.3;
(iii) furnish each year a rolling eight-year financial plan containing
projected income statements, sources and application of funds, and balance
sheets; (iv) furnish its annual financial statements, certified by an
acceptable auditor within six months from the end or each financial year;
(v) carry out a study on ZPEPB's reorganization and management improvement in
accordance with the terms of reference and timing-agreed with the Bank, and
exchange views with the Bank on the progress and'the findings of the study;
(vi) carry out an environmental monitoring program satisfactory to the Bank;
and (vii) carry out a resettlement plan satisfactory to the Bank. Execution
of the subsidiary loan agreement between the Government and ZPEPB and approval
of the Loan Agreement by the State Council would be conditions of loan
effectiveness.
11.       Justification.  Zhejiang Provincial Grid provides 23Z of the capa-
city and 18% of the power generation in East China Region. Electricity short-
ages have been one of the major constraints to economic development. Power
curtailment by rotation has been enforced in almost all industries, limiting
their operation to only four to five days a week and causing considerable
underutilization of plant facilities and manpower. In Zhejiang provincial
grid alone, in 1986, the shortage in peaking capacity was about 600-700 MW.
In addition, there were 167 MW in capacity of large consumers ready to receive
power but not connected. A detailed economic study by the Ministry of Water
Resources and Electric Power (MWREP), which was reviewed by the Bank, has
established that extension of the existing Beilungang thermal power station
provides the least cost and fastest solution to meeting the power shortage in
East China. The internal economic rate of return (IERR) of the project is



-4-
estimated at 15.0X. Finally, the project will contribute substantially
towards institutional building to improve efficiency and management of a power
utility.
12.       No special risks are expected with the proposed project, since it is
an extension of an ongoing project. Land is already available and site condi-
tions are well known. The technical soundness and economic feasibility of the
project have been well established. An environmental assessment has resulted
in the inclusion of pollution control equipment and monitoring program.
Consulting engineers, both local anid foreign, will assist in engineering and
design, procurement and coordination.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.

balances are converted to dollars at the current exchange rate between the dollar and the
SDR. In some cases, therefore, the undisbursed balance indicates a dollar amount greater
than the original principal credit amount expressed in dollars.
