IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
CHINA
BEILUNGANG THERMAL POWER EXTENSION PROJECT (LOAN 2955-CHA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Beilungang Thermal
Power Extension Project in China for which Loan 2955-CHA in the amount of
$165 million was approved on June 14, 1988 and made effective on February 2, 1989.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1995, 24 months beyond the date originally
envisaged, June 30, 1993.  The balance of the loan, $55,505.73, was canceled on
October 31, 1995. The total disbursed amount was $164,944,494.27.
The ICR was prepared by Shigeru Kataoka and Elaine Sun, Infrastructure
Operations Division, China and Mongolia Department of the East Asia and Pacific Region,
and reviewed by Mr. Richard Scurfield, Division Chief, and Mr. Yo Kimura, Project
Advisor. The Borrower/Beneficiary provided comments, which are included as an annex to
the ICR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun during the Bank's final supervision mission in
March 1995. It is based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Project Agreements,
Supervision Reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower/Beneficiary,
internal Bank memoranda and interviews with Bank and Borrower/Beneficiary staff
involved in project implementation.  The Borrower/Beneficiary contributed to the
preparation of the ICR by commenting on the draft ICR, preparing an evaluation of the
project's execution and implementation, and by contributing views reflected in the
mission's aide-memoire.

CHINA
BEILUNGANG THERMAL POWER EXTENSION PROJECT (LOAN 2955-CHA)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    The Beilungang Thermal Power Extension Project was designed to support
industrial growth in East China by increasing electricity supply to the East China Grid,
which was suffering from acute power shortages. The project was also used as a vehicle to:
(a) support the national policy of developing large coal-fired thermal power generating
units to make effective use of China's abundant coal reserves; (b) continue the effort to
introduce modern technology in plant design and construction management of 600 MW
thermal power units; and (c) provide technical assistance to the implementing agency, the
Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power Bureau (ZPEPB), for reorganizing its operations and
strengthening  its management.   This assistance was aimed at facilitating its
transforrnation from a power bureau to a more autonomous power entity.
2.    Financing under the project provides for: (a) extension of the Beilungang Thermal
Power Plant by adding a second 600-MW unit and constructing the second single circuit of
500-kV transmission line (245 km between Beilungang and Pingyao) and extension of the
Shaoxin and Pingyao substations; (b) provision of consulting services for engineering,
procurement, and review of design drawings and interfacing among various contract
packages; (c) a study for ZPEPB's reorganization and management improvement; (d) a
study for expanding and improving the distribution networks for the cities of Hangzhou and
Ningbo; and (e) a training program.
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    Project implementation was generally successful and the above objectives were
achieved within the budget.  The project provided a fully integrated state-of-the-art
600 MW coal-fired unit that set technical and economic performance standards for a series
of same size units that were subsequently installed in China. This was the second such unit
designed, constructed and operated by ZPEPB and only the fourth in China. As such, it
represented a remarkable technical achievement. The project's successful implementation
of the special study on ZPEPB's reorganization and management improvement led to
implementation of recommended changes and priming ZPEPB for full commercialization
under subsequent operations. The final cost was $170.6 million in foreign expenditures and
Y 649.3 million in local costs, compared to an estimated $199.7 million in foreign costs and
Y 333.0 million in local costs. The local cost increase mainly resulted from inflation-
related cost increases for both labor and materials and additional scope of supply for the
second 500-kV line between Shaoxin and Pingyao.



- iv -
4.    Commercial operation of the power plant was about 30 months later than expected
at appraisal due to delays in procurement of main equipment, erection work (due to bad
weather), the need to correct deficiencies in equipment quality, and difficulties in
coordinating suppliers. Throughout implementation of the project, ZPEPB performed
satisfactorily, and responded to problems appropriately by taking firm measures with
contractors, expanding its project management staff, and reinforcing its quality assurance
system.
Summary of Findings, Future Operations and Key Lessons Learned
5.    Along with a previous Bank-assisted operation (the first Beilungang Thermal Power
Project, Ln. 2706-CHA), the project was instrumental in laying the basis for ZPEPB's
future development, in terms of its facilities, manpower, financial strength and commercial
orientation. First, the project facilitated the transfer to ZPEPB of up-to-date technology for
the construction and operation of a second 600-MW coal-fired unit which was followed by
three additional 600-MW units and major transmission and urban distribution expansion
under the current Zhejiang Power Development Project (Ln. 3846-CHA, 1995). Second,
implementation of the recommendations of the project's institutional study realized the
study's goal of introducing managerial autonomy and accountability as well as modem
management organizations, systems and procedures.  Corporatization, the long-term
objective of these initial efforts, is occurring under the current project.
6.    Under this project, ZPEPB accumulated experience in design and construction
technology of state-of-the-art 600 MW large-capacity coal-fired plants. The project's rate
of return calculated at completion, was 17.1 percent, compared to the appraisal estimate of
15 percent because the "willingness to pay" for power is now demonstrated to be higher
than original estimates.
7.    Based on lessons learned from  the first Beilungang project, the project
management system and quality assurance system were reinforced in this project.
However, in the course of implementation, ZPEPB again experienced technical defects in
the plant equipment and increasing difficulties of management of interfaces within and
between the various contract packages. This experience suggested the need for more
stringent quality-assurance systems for both ZPEPB and the contractors, and also
suggested that the number of contract packages should be minimized to the extent
possible to reduce interfacing problems.  The need for greater external expertise,
particularly in construction management, was similarly a project lesson.

BEILUNGANG THERMAL POWER EXTENSION PROJECT
(LOAN 2955-CHA)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1.    The Beilungang project is located in a major load center in the East China Grid.
When the project was identified, East China was already one of the country's most
important industrial areas, accounting for about 25 percent of total national production.
However, a shortage of electricity supply was a major constraint to economic development
in the region. Power curtailment by rotation was enforced in almost all industries, limiting
their operation to only four to five days a week, with consequent underutilization of plant
facilities and manpower.
2.    Of necessity, the Government's commitment to industrial development entailed a
commitment to modernize and expand the power sector and make it more efficient. To this
end, it encouraged:  (a) expansion of generating capacity as rapidly as possible;
(b) increased financial autonomy of sector enterprises; (c) gradual introduction of a more
rational pricing system; (d) modem techniques in project design and system planning;
(e) development of coal-fired thermal plants at mine mouths and ports; (f) construction of
extrahigh-voltage transmission lines for interconnection between regions; and (g) replacing
medium-sized (50-100 MW) units with higher pressure (300-600 MW) units to improve
energy generation efficiency.
3.    The Beilungang Thermal Power Extension Project for construction of the second
600-MW unit responded to these goals by: (a) alleviating the acute power shortage of a
major load center in East China; (b) developing a large coal-fired thermal power plant in a
port area; (c) continuing the effort to introduce modem technology in plant design and
construction management of 600 MW thermal power units; (d) constructing 500 kV
transmission lines to transfer power between optimal generating sites and load centers,
facilitating eventual regional interconnections; and (e) providing technical assistance to the
implementing agency, the Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power Bureau (ZPEPB), for
reorganizing its operations and strengthening its management, to facilitate its transformation
from a power bureau to a more autonomous power entity.



-2 -
4.    The project comprised:
(a)   extension of the Beilungang Thermal Power Plant by adding a second 600-
MW unit;
(b)   construction of the second single circuit of 500-kV transmission line
between Beilungang and Pingyao (245 km) and extension of the Shaoxin
and Pingyao substations;
(c)   provision of consultant services for engineering, procurement, and review of
design drawings and interfacing among various contract packages for
equipment;
(d)   a study for ZPEPB's reorganization and management improvement;
(e)   a study for expanding and improving the distribution networks for the cities
of Hangzhou and Ningbo; and
(f)   a training program.
B. ACHIEVEMENT OF PROJECT OBJECTIVES
5.    The project achieved its primary objectives of alleviating power shortages and
supporting economic growth in the region through development of a large capacity coal-
fired unit with transmission to the major load centers. This was the second 600-MW unit
designed, constructed and operated by ZPEPB (and only the fourth in China).  It
represented a remarkable technical achievement and set the stage for the Zhejiang Power
Development Project (Ln. 3846-CHA, approved in 1995) for construction of three
additional 600 MW units and a major transmission network expansion.
6.    The institutional development objective was successfully achieved through the
special study for ZPEPB's reorganization and management improvement. The study was
carried out to define needed measures to reorganize ZPEPB's operations and further
strengthen its management. The main objective of the reform measures was to begin to
transform the Bureau into a company with increased autonomy and accountability. The
tariff study included in the reorganization study similarly set the stage for improvement of
ZPEPB's financial performance. The study reviewed the level and structure of power tariffs
for the East China power system, and introduced the marginal cost pricing principles now
widely accepted in China. Following on from these studies, ZPEPB has completely
redesigned its tariff structure, and the revised structure is being phased in.
7.    The objective of transferring technology was also achieved. Through the special
study for extending and improving the distribution networks for the cities of Hangzhou and
Ningbo, a program for renovation of the distribution network was developed and the
required investments until the year 2000 are being financed under the subsequent Zhejiang

Power Development Project. Further technological upgrading of distribution planning
techniques will occur under that project.
C. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD AND MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROJECT
Implementation Schedule
8.     The project power plant was synchronized  to  the  system  in  April 1994,
commissioned in October 1994 (the date of completion of 7-days full load operation) and
put into commercial operation in November 1994, 30 months behind the appraisal
estimate. (See Table 5 for details.) The delay resulted from: (a) about 7 months delay in
procurement of major equipment packages; (b) about 9 months delay in finalization of
foundation designs, which delayed the start of pilings for the boiler and main building
foundations;' (c) delay in civil works to overcome unforeseen soft soil conditions;
(d) delay in civil works due to record-breaking cold temperatures in the winter of 1991
and an abnormally heavy rainfall in March 1992; (e) necessary corrections and repair
works for rectification of deficiencies in equipment quality during the commissioning and
postcommissioning periods; and (f) interfacing problems between contract islands.
Factors (c) and (d) accounted for about 6 months of delays, and factors (e) and (f)
accounted for 8 months of delays. The loan closing date was extended by two years,
from June 30, 1993 to June 30, 1995, to accommodate the delayed completion.
Outstanding Issues During Implementation
9.     Experiences gained under the first Beilungang Thermal Power Project (Ln. 2706-
CHA) which constructed the first 600-MW unit, were reflected in the design and
implementation of construction of the second unit, especially in the following areas:
(a)    Since coal quality problems may have caused a boiler accident in the first
project, management of coal supply and coal quality control were reinforced
in the second project to ensure compliance with requirements of operational
specifications. To avoid formation of excessive slag, which may also have
contributed to an explosion in the boiler under the previous project,
operating criteria for the sootblowers were improved and the tube metal
temperature was strictly controlled within the design value;
(b)    Project management and the quality control system were reinforced; and
The SAR estimate for the start of pilings was January 1989, based on the date of contract of major equipment
packages in August 1988. The actual dates of the contracts for the boiler and turbine-generator packages were
January and March 1989, respectively. To meet with this revised schedule, the start of piling was rescheduled to
start in January 1990. Subsequently, further delay caused by the events of June 4, 1989 occurred. Design liaison
meeting was postponed for several months. This resulted in delay in finalization of foundation drawings of major
equipment. This delay was counted for 9 months.



- 4 -
(c)   Counter measures were taken for soft soil conditions at the site. For
reinforcement of the foundation, a vertical isolation wall was added between
the two units. This provision required about 6 months extra time in the
construction schedule and additional expenditure of Y 20 million.
10.   In spite of reinforcement of the project management and quality control system,
construction difficulties continued in the following areas:
(a)   Problems were experienced in managing interfacing of major and auxiliary
contracts packages, largely for two reasons.  First, major equipment
contractors for units #1 and #2 were different and consisted of two different
boiler contractors and two different turbine generator contractors in one
power station. On the other hand, contractors for the instrumentation and
control system and electrical equipment for house auxiliaries were the same
for the two. Considerable additional interfacing and coordination work
among major and auxiliary islands was therefore needed. Second, the start
of contracts for some auxiliary equipment (the ash handling system and
electrical equipment) was delayed because of shortages in foreign funds due
to devaluation of the US dollar against European and Japanese currencies in
1990 (para. 14 for details).
(b)   During the construction commissioning and postcommissioning periods,
many defects in equipment quality were discovered. To rectify these
defects, the date of the commercial operation was delayed (see para. 8) and
also the performance acceptance tests for major packages were delayed (see
Table 5 for details). During the construction period, defects in the turbine
low-pressure casing (deformation), high-pressure condenser tube sheet
(leakage), generator support plates, a cracked nozzle of the boiler drum,
etc. were experienced. And during the commissioning period, various
problems and defects of the equipment, such as vibration of the turbine
because of deformation of the lower casing, defects in the boiler feed
pump, lube oil system, material of oil cooler, rotating rectifier, etc. were
experienced. During the postcommissioning period, defects in the exciter,
turbine-driven boiler feed pump and high-pressure heater were found.
11.   Power Generation. The operation record during 1994-95, following completion of
the 7-day full load test on October 20, 1994, is summarized below:

Note: FH = first half; SH = second half.

12.   Project Costs Excluding Interest During Construction. The estimated cost of the
project at appraisal was $178.0 million in foreign costs and Y 306.73 million in local costs,
equivalent to a total of $260.9 million (Y 965.3 million). The final cost was $170.58
million in foreign costs and Y 649.18 million in local costs, equivalent to a total of $276.89
million (Y 1,559.60 million) (see Tables 8a-1 and 8a-2 for details). As compared with the
appraisal estimate, the project had a cost overrun of about 6.1 percent when expressed in US
dollars and a cost overrun of about 61.5 percent when expressed in local currency. These
variations were mainly caused by: (a) higher-than-expected inflation; (b) the devaluation of
the local currency; and (c) additional equipment purchases (see para. 13 for details). The
exchange rate changed from Y 3.7 to $1 at the time of appraisal to Y 8.7 to $1 by the end of
1994, when the main components were completed. The compound average exchange rates
over the construction period (1989 to 1995) were Y 5.3 to $1 for foreign cost expenditure,
and Y 6.1 to $1 for local cost expenditure. The impact of the devaluation of the Yuan
caused a cost increase of about Y 43 million for locally-financed imported materials (steel,
cement, timber, etc.).
13.   The local project expenditures, expressed in Yuan terms, increased for four reasons:
(a)   an additional Y 20 million needed for additional construction of the isolation
barrier between foundations of the two units due to soft soil conditions;
(b)   an additional Y 157 million for substantial inflation-driven increases of
salaries for local laborers and locally procured materials for civil and
erection works;
(c)   an additional Y 5.0 million for coal handling plant which was originally
planned to be imported and subsequently changed to local procurement, due
to the unexpectedly high price of imported equipment; and
(d)   an additional Y 150.0 million for the transmission lines and substations due
to: (i) additional procurement of the second 500-kV line between Shaoxin
and Pingyao (100 km), and (ii) inflation-driven cost increases.
14.   A summary comparison of the estimated disbursements at appraisal with the actual
disbursements is given in Table 4. The original loan closing date was June 30, 1993. The
actual closing date was June 30, 1995, after two extensions due to delayed completion of
the unit. A total of $55,505.73 was canceled from the loan on October 31, 1995. The total
loan amount disbursed was $164,944,494.27.
15.   Procurement. The project included 25 procurement contracts, of which 12 entailed
international competitive bidding (ICB). The total amount of the procurement contracts
was $162.13 million equivalent, of which $159.74 million equivalent was under ICB
packages. All procurement activities for the project were performed in accordance with the
Bank's procurement guidelines and were generally carried out satisfactorily.



- 6 -
16.   One problem did arise in project procurement. In the procurement financed by the
Bank's loan, over 85 percent of the contract amount required non-US currency. The
devaluation of the US currency against European and Japanese currencies in 1990 resulted
in a cost overrun (about $13 million) and affected procurement of auxiliary facilities (ash
handling plant and electrical equipment). Due to the shortage of foreign currency, the
downpayments for the contracts for the ash handling plant and electrical equipment could
not be paid. To respond to ZPEPB's request, the Bank agreed to utilize about $7 million
from Loan 2706-CHA for the down payment on the ash handling plant. In addition, about
$6 million was financed by the Bank of China. Implementation of the above contracts were
delayed by about one year.
17.   Consulting Services and Training. Following the completion of the first unit
under Ln. 2706-CHA, the need for consulting services for the project was considered to be
greatly reduced. A foreign firm was selected to carry out consulting services for assistance
to ZPEPB for bid evaluation and contracting; assistance on foundation design; coordination
for interfacing of various islands; and assistance in the review of vender's drawings. The
performance of the consultants was satisfactory and met the requirements of their terms of
reference. Participation of the foreign consultant in the consulting services terminated in
1991. After that, construction management for interfacing among various contract islands
was carried out by ZPEPB. ZPEPB, however, experienced some problems with project
construction management and quality control of the plant (see para. 10). One lesson leamed
under the project was the continuing need for external consulting services, with particular
regard to construction management. This lesson has been taken into account in defining the
scope of consultancy services in the subsequent Zhejiang Power Development Project.
18.  In this project, training mainly focused on project-related areas like the use of up-to-
date technology for CAD-aided design review, erection, commissioning, operation and
maintenance of large capacity units. Both domestic and overseas training was provided
under the project. Domestic training covered operation and maintenance staff (120 persons,
270 staff-months) at domestic power plants. The international training comprised visits
abroad for 50 persons (127 staff-months) to the United States, Canada and France.
19.   Economic Performance. At appraisal, the ex-ante internal economic rate of return
(EIRR) was estimated at about 15.0 percent, based on measurable economic costs and
benefits associated with the 600 MW development. The ex-post EIRR is about 17.1 percent
(with shadow price adjustment as shown in Table 9). The higher EIRR came from
increases in tariffs. The electricity sales price of Y 0.42/kWh (Beilungang bulk supply) was
used. This price was set according to the "new plant/new price" policy and is fully passed
on to the consumers. The ex-post IERR of 17.1 percent is based on annual generation
ranging from 2,220 GWh to 3,300 GWh. The variation reflects projected annual generation
taking into account scheduled overhauls. If the annual generation is based on the estimates
of the SAR (3,900 GWh; 600,000 kW, 6,500 hours), the IERR is even higher at 19.7
percent.



- 7 -
20.   Financial Performance. Salient features of ZPEPB's finances during the period
1987-94 are sunmrarized in Annex 1. ZPEPB's overall operating results and financial
position were satisfactory even though its actual rate of return on fixed assets in service, 8.1
percent, fell short of the expected 12.2 percent. This notwithstanding, tariff increases were
higher than expected, from 8.5 fen/kWh in 1987 to 27.5 fen/kWh in 1994, representing an
annual increase of 18.1 percent in nominal terms; at appraisal, a tariff of 16.1 fen/kWh was
projected in 1994, with an increase of 9.6 percent per year. The higher tariff levels were
due to the much higher than expected inflation in China over the period, which resulted in
an annual increase of 33 percent in operating costs. Average annual growth in energy sales
was generally in line with expectations, 12.3 versus 12.8 percent at appraisal, with a more
even growth pattern from year to year. However, as a result of macroeconomic controls by
the Government during 1989-92, investments and borrowing both were short of
expectation, about 75 percent and 90 percent of projections, respectively.  ZPEPB,
therefore, met the financial performance targets set forth under the project except in 1994.
Two factors contributed to ZPEPB's poor performance in 1994, with self-financing
capability falling below the target of 25 percent. First, the tariff increase was tightly
controlled by the Government as an anti-inflation measure, with tariffs increasing only by
4.6 percent while operating costs rose by 25.2 percent. Second, capital expenditure grew by
121 percent from 1993 to 1994. ZPEPB expected to raise its tariff level to 33 fen/kWh in
1995 and improve its financial position and meet the Bank's financial covenants. The
debt/equity ratios were kept at a conservative level throughout the period, with the highest
of 64/36 in 1991.
21.   Environment and Resettlement. The Beilungang site is located in a scarcely
populated agricultural area along the seacoast.  The project was designed to meet
environmental standards of Chinese and World Bank guidelines. ZPEPB carried out
periodic environmental monitoring before and after commissioning of the first and second
600-MW units. Monitoring showed that the project had no excessive impacts on the
environment.
22.   This project was an extension project to the existing Beilungang plant for which
necessary resettlement was already carried out. The project required very little resettlement,
all of which was done satisfactorily, with standards of living sustained. Compensation
levels were adequate. Details of the resettlement related to the existing plant are shown in
the ICR for the first Beilungang project (Report No. 14717, dated June 27, 1995). The
additional resettlement related to this extension project was due to the second single 500-kV
line between Shaoxin and Pingyao substations, which had 212 towers, passing through
municipalities and counties such as Shaoxin, Zhuji, Xisoshan, Fuyang and Yuhang. Land
for the 212 towers, totaling 2.67 ha, was required, and houses and other buildings with a
total area of 23,575.6 m2 were relocated. Eighty-five families with 340 people were
relocated. The cost for land acquisition and resettlement was Y 4,777,049.0.

D. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY
23.   The project is sustainable. First, demand for the plant's full output exists since
power shortages continue to be acute and economic growth has been sustained at a high
level. The unit is therefore being operated with a high plant-load factor. Second, current
and future provincial average power sales tariffs are designed to fully recover capital and
operating costs. From 1987 to 1994, the electricity sales of ZPEPB grew at an average
annual rate of 12 percent.
24.   Through this project and subsequent power projects supported by the Bank, the
Chinese have made good progress in evaluating the economic costs of electricity and coal,
and in suggesting approaches to gradual price reform. For electricity, long-run marginal
costs and target tariffs were established for East China in 1988. Since then, the Bank has
continued to sponsor the formulation of tariff action plans adapted to the specific conditions
of regional power grids.
25.   With reference to institutional development, the study undertaken to address
improvement of ZPEPB's organization and management was successfully conducted. It
made recommendations for, inter alia, appropriate capital and corporate structures, as well
as for performance monitoring and evaluation systems. These recommendations have
already had some influence in development of the Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power
Company as an independent entity, and will be more fully implemented under the Zhejiang
Power Development Project supported by Bank Loan 3846-CHA.
E. BANK PERFORMANCE
26.   Bank performance from project preparation through completion was satisfactory.
The Bank maintained good relations with the borrower, the beneficiary and the consultants
throughout project execution. During implementation, the Bank regularly supervised the
project, including the construction schedule, procurement, financial aspects, loan covenants,
project cost updating, and studies and training activities, to ensure smooth implementation.
In addition, with its first three power projects in China (Beilungang, Beilungang extension
and Wujing), the Bank established a basis for cooperation and dialogue between the
borrower/beneficiary and the Bank in the development of the power subsector in China,
including institutional restructuring and electricity pricing reform. To date, the Bank has
assisted in implementing 17 power projects in China with total assistance of about $3.8
billion.
F. BORROWER PERFORMANCE
27.   ZPEPB successfully completed the major project components, its second 600-MW
coal-fired unit and associated 500-kV transmission line and substations in spite of many
difficulties. It overcame problems as they arose, including the delay in design finalization
due to the events in 1989, soft soil conditions, poor quality of some equipment, and
interfacing problems, and translated the lessons learned under this project into strategies for
avoiding similar problems under the subsequent project. ZPEPB introduced and absorbed



- 9 -
the latest design technology and construction management and operational management
techniques for power plants, with the assistance of foreign consultants and training
activities. It also developed institutionally and, under the recently approved Zhejiang
Power Development Project, is fully commercializing its operations.
G. ASSESSMENT OF OUTCOME
28.   The project outcome is rated as satisfactory.  ZPEPB achieved the project
objectives, and completion of the project contributed significantly to mitigating the
shortages of power supply in the East China grid and promoting industrial production and
regional economic development. Training for technical personnel in design, construction,
commissioning, operation and maintenance contributed to transferring the up-to-date
technologies needed for large-capacity coal-fired plants.
H. FUTURE OPERATION
29.   Operation of this project is expected to be smooth, and will be monitored during
supervision of the recently approved Zhejiang Power Development Project. The latter
provides for: (a) a major expansion of the power station, with three 600-MW coal-fired
units; as well as (b) technical assistance aimed at commercialization and corporatization of
what is now the Zhejiang Provincial Electric Power Company (ZPEPC) and its affiliated
enterprises. An Action Plan for Power Sector Reform under this last project would develop
ZPEPC into a power company separated from government, with operational autonomy,
accountability for profits and losses, and self-sufficiency in its development. ZPEPC's
institutional improvements already carried out have allowed the latest project to be funded
in part by a Bank partial guarantee for long-term commercial funds, as well as a security
package for a joint-venture-developed cogeneration plant. These projects therefore show
the value of incremental reform fostered under Bank operations in this sector.
I. KEY LESSONS LEARNED
30.   The major component of this project was the construction of the second 600-MW
coal-fired unit, subsequent to the construction of the first 600-MW unit. Experience and
lessons learned with the first unit were reflected in various aspects of constructing and
operating the second unit, including improved coal management, technical
countermeasures to prevent formation of slag, civil works designs geared to soft soil
conditions, reinforcement of project management, reinforcement of the quality control
system, and improved procurement management using the Bank's model bidding
documents.  In spite of these improvements, ZPEPB experienced some technical
problems in project construction, mainly related to: (a) management of interfacing of the
various contract packages; and (b) technical defects in plant equipment encountered
during erection and commissioning.



- 10-
31.   Key lessons learned from the project were:
(a)   Although the design parameters of the major equipment were selected on
the basis of fully-proven designs, the project experienced many defects in
design and workmanship of the major equipment.  This experience
suggested the need for more stringent quality assurance systems in both
ZPEPB and the contractors.
(b)   Regarding island-based procurement management, the number of contract
packages should be minimized to the extent possible to reduce interfacing
problems.
(c)   The effectiveness of consulting services, particularly for construction
management, benefits from inputs by international experts.
(d)   The devaluation of the US dollar against European and Japanese
currencies resulted in the beneficiary's loss of $13 million. Measures to
avoid or minimize risks related to foreign currency movements should be
sought.
32.   Based on the above lessons, reinforcement of construction management using
foreign consultants and more manageable procurement packaging were introduced in the
subsequent Zhejiang Power Development Project.

ANNEX 2: AIDE-MEMOIRE OF THE SUPERVISION MISSION
(March 20, 1995)
General
1.    A mission from the World Bank (Mr. S. Kataoka) visited Hangzhou on March 17
and 20, 1995 to review the current status of the construction of the second 600-MW unit
(Ln. 2955-CHA) and associated 500-kV transmission line and substations, procurement
and disbursement, training, environmental monitoring and project cost updating, and to
discuss preparation of an Implementation Completion Report (ICR). The mission would
like to thank ZPEPB and its staff for the excellent preparation for the visit, warm
hospitality and efficient cooperation extended. This Aide-Memoire summarizes the
mission's findings, the principal matters discussed and understanding reached.
Construction Progress of the Second Unit
2.    The commissioning of the unit is underway. After initial steam to turbine
(02/06/94) synchronization (04/02/94) and completion of seven days full load running
(10/20/94), the unit was stopped on December 15, 1995 due to severe vibration in the
unit. After a stop of 45 days for realignment of the turbine bearings and casings, the unit
was restarted on February 15, 1995. To date (03/17/95), the electricity generated by the
unit is 295 GWh. After the performance guarantee (PG) tests for the boiler and turbine-
generator, the unit is expected to be put into commercial operation in May/June 1995.
3.    During the commissioning period, various equipment problems and defects were
experienced. Such problems and defects were related to the following equipment or
systems:
(a)   Vibration of the turbine-generator unit, because of deformation of the
lower casing;
(b)   Lube oil system;
(c)   Oil cooler material;
(d)   Boiler feed pump;
(e)   Electrostatic precipitator; -
(f)   Pulverizer system (pyrite jet pump and lube oil pump);
(g)   Mismatching between boiler and turbine systems;



- 31-                     ANNEX2
(h)   Rotating the rectifier-type exciter; and
(i)    Vibration in No. 1O bearing (exciter end).
It took three months to rectify those problems and defects. Some of them are still not
fully rectified (See para. 5).
4.    The PG test for the boiler unit started at the beginning of March 1995. Auxiliary
power consumption exceeded the guarantee. To date (03/17/95), the unit has not
complied with the performance guarantee.
5.    Although the PG test for the turbine-generator was scheduled to be carried out
from the beginning of March, several defects such as those in turbine driven boiler feed
pumps and motor driven boiler feed pump still need further rectification. The PG test is
expected to be started in May 1995.
Transmission Line and Substation
6.    The second 500-kV line between Shaoxin and Pingyao substations was put into
service on December 24, 1994. With this (completion), all 500-kV transmission lines and
associated substations in this project was completed.
Procurement and Disbursements
7.    All major procurement activities have been finalized. Additional procurement for
minor parts such as spare parts and testing instruments, etc. are underway and will be
completed by the end of June 1995.
8.    As of end-March 1995, the disbursement amount was $143.6 million and the
remaining balance was $21.4 million. The remaining items are final payments (ten
percent of the contract amounts) for the boiler, turbine-generator and instrumentation and
control (I&C) packages, additional procurement for 500 kV substation equipment and
steel for transmission line, etc. Disbursement for those items will be completed by
June/October 1995.
Project Cost Updating
9.    ZPEPB prepared and submitted the updated project cost to the mission.
Environmental Monitoring
10.   The results of environmental monitoring after completion of Unit #2 will be
reported to the Bank by the end of June 1995.

ANNEX 3: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BORROWER'S
PERSPECTIVE
Buyer Performance and Key Lessons Learned
1.    Beilungang Thermal Power Plant Extension Project is the second 600-MW
turbine-generator unit firing with coal, which has been constructed by ZPEPB using the
loan from the World Bank. On the base of our utilizing the loan (Loan No. 2706-CHA)
from the World Bank for Unit #1, we've completed the whole contents of the project
under the help of the World Bank. Now the Beilungang Thermal Power Plant with
1,200 MW has been constructed, and it has become one of the largest thermal power
plants in the whole Zhejiang Province and the whole East China area. This plays an
important role to relax the electric power tension of the whole Zhejiang Province.
2.    During the engineering construction, we've learned more knowledge on design,
erection, commissioning and production management from abroad, and have known well
the constructional and operational rules of the large size thermal power plant. Under the
help of the consulting company abroad, we drew up equipment bidding documentation,
made the construction of the unit with the key of quality. In the arrangement of the
construction schedule, we did the partial commissioning step by step according to the
characteristic of large size unit, and then made the trial operation of the whole unit.
We've passed the check test specified by China that the large size unit can be put into
trial production only after 168 hours continuous operation. After putting into production
unit performance stable, and electricity is generated safely and normally. A lot of
technical and administrative personnel have been trained through the construction of Unit
#2, and this creates the condition for the coming "Zhejiang Electric Power Developing
Project."
3.    During Beilungang Extension Engineering, our detailed improvement is listed as
follows:
(a)   For the convenience of the power plant operator's operation, I&C
equipment is supplied by the former manufacturer of Unit #1 through the
permission of the World Bank. So I&C system of the whole plant can be
conformable, and normal production of the power plant can be assured.
(b)   Staff training has been sufficiently concerned about. We trained the
operators on the simulators which were purchased. Besides this, we sent
the operators and technical personnel to the domestic large size power
plant for training. Purpose of this is to meet the operation requirements of
the large size power plant.

(c)   Pay attention to management of coal. Set up the daily coal supplying
distribution drawing of the coal yard. Referring to coal transported by
boat, coal stored in the coal yard and coal in the furnace, daily analysis is
done to master the coal-fired condition. Coal is divided into piles and put
into furnace and fired layer by layer, so that the normal firing in the
furnace can be controlled. At the same time, maintenance of sootblowers
is strengthened, high utilization ratio is kept. Temperature of tube metal is
strictly controlled to prevent from exceeding. Normal operation of the
unit is assured, output of generating electric power is increased year by
year.
(d)   Sum up the experience and lessons of soft soil during the construction of
Boiler # 1.  Take the effective measures in advance, so the civil
construction quality can be assured. During the erection, rules of "Quality
Package" is carried out. Inspection rules are carried out strictly. Make
sure that each working procedure meets the requirement of quality
standard, so the construction quality is improved.
(e)   Master variety of the exchange rate for the foreign currency at any time.
Measures are taken in time, so that the loan can be used smoothly. When
the US dollars were devaluated in 1990, the value of signed non-US
dollars procurement contract exceeded the original loan amount. There
was no balance for ash handling system and plant electrical equipment
contract. It would affect the proceeding of the whole project. We advised
the World Bank and the state bank about it in time, and got support from
them, paid the ash handling equipment contract in the Loan No. 2706-
CHA of Unit #1. Regarding the 90 percent contract funds of electrical
equipment, loan was got from the Bank of China. After 1993, when most
of the contract execution were nearly finished, we found that 8 million US
dollars would be surplus for our loan due to the variety of the rate of
exchange. We reported the World Bank for purchasing the imported
equipment required by No. 11 500 KV transmission line project from
Shaoxing to Pinyao and for additionally purchasing the spare parts and
small size construction tools for the power plant production, so the loan
was run out of. What's more, it creates the condition for the future
"Zhejiang Electric Power Development Project".
Project Review from the Buyer's Perspective
(a)   In the loan of Unit #2, five main islands are divided for the power plant
main equipment and we took the way of international bidding. Though the
I&C Island, Ash Handling Island and Electrical Equipment are former
equipment suppliers of Unit #1, the main equipment of the Boiler Island
and the Turbine Island are different from the equipment suppliers of Unit
#1.  What's more, type, structure and arrangement of the unit is



- 37 -                    ANNEX3
completely different. We not only put more concern about the interface
among the islands, but also met the new problem for unit erection,
equipment  commissioning,  operation  running  and  production
management.  Simultaneously two units came from  four different
countries, respectively, and this caused inconvenience for the future
operation and production of the power plant. In future we should decrease
dividing the islands in one respect, and we should purchase two units once
in the other respect. It's quite necessary.
(b)   On the base of the construction of Unit #1, we've made much more
improvement for the construction of Unit #2, but the construction progress
is still quite long. It needs certain time to solve the problem of soft soil.
Besides this, it seems that the period from the unit commissioning to the
commercial operation is too long (it's estimated to spend 21 months).
Period from the whole unit commissioning to the trial production is 8.5
months, but after 12 months of trial production, commercial operation
could be entered. Some major equipment defects existing in the major
equipment manufacture needed to be corrected. Besides it, we should
make greater progress in the management method and the management
level.
(c)   Soft soil in the coastal areas should be carefully studied, and more
effective measure and technology will be taken. Under the premise of
guarantee quality, shortening the construction period and saving the
construction investment will still be the coming major subjects of ZPEPB.
According to our statistics, due to the treatment of soft soil in the initial
period, the construction of Unit #2 has been delayed more than six
months, additional 20 million RMB has been spent for investment. This
should be summed up. In the future large size thermal power plant will be
set up in the coastal areas of our province, and at that time this general but
key problem will be met.
(d)   We need to make further study on how to decrease the risk of the rate of
the exchange so that the using of loan can ensure the project execution. It
needs the support of the World Bank. In the procurement contract of Unit
#2, over 85 percent is paid with non-US dollars, this is affected by the rate
of the exchange in the international market. In one period, US dollars
were devaluated, the loan wasn't enough and the engineering construction
was affected. In the other period, US dollars were revaluated and the loan
was surplus. This problem caused by the variety of the rate of exchange
for foreign currency needs to be investigated and to be solved under the
support of the World Bank and the relevant departments of the state.
