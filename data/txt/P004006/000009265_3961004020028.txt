MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCrION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA
FOR THE EASTERN INDONESIA KABUPATEN ROADS PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of US$155 million to help
finance the Eastern Indonesia Kabupaten Roads project. The loan would be at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate with a maturity of 20 years, including 5 years of grace.
2.          Background. Unlike the national road system that has remained static in length
at about 50,000 km, the Kabupaten (or district) roads network of Indonesia has been growing
(mainly through the absorption of village roads) at about 7 percent per annum in the past 10
years. It now totals about 176,700 km, i.e., more than three times the size of the national and
provincial roads network. Because 5; Indonesia's high proportion of rural population and the
importance of agriculture in its economy, GOI has given high priority to kabupaten roads.
During the past decade, annual expenditures on kabupaten roads have grown about 25 percent
each year to about Rp 1.3 trillion in 1991/92. In support of this strategy, donors (IBRD, ADB,
OECF and USAID) have provided extensive assistance to the subsector. In June 1992 the
Executive Directors approved Loan 3490-IND for the Third Kabupaten Roads Development
Project (KR3), which covers 73 kabupatens in 9 western provinces of Indonesia. The proposed
Eastern Indonesia Kabupaten Roads (KREI) project is really an etension of the KR3 project to
51 kabupatens in 7 eastern provinces that were selected from the islands of Sulawesi, Nusa
Tenggara and Irian Jaya.
3.          Eastern Indonesia as defined here, includes 40 percent of the total national land
area, and 13 percent of the population. The region comprises some 4 million absolute poor
among its total population of 20 million and thus has a higher incidence of poverty (19 percent)
than the national average (15 percent). The poverty incidence is particularly high in the
Tenggaras (26 percent or 1.8 million) but somewhat lower in Sulawesi (12 percent or 1.5
million). Those above the poverty line are, however, not much better off; the average GDP per
capita is only twice the poverty line in the Tenggaras, and about three times in Sulawesi. The
region is also less well endowed in terms of kabupaten roads with only 25 percent of the
network. The quality of its kabupaten roads is weU below the country average with only about
one quarter of the network sealed; the comparative figure is 64 percent in Java. By province,
the traffic on Eastern Region kabupaten roads ranges on average from about 50 to 200 vpd, but
distances travelled between population centers are relatively large.
4.          Subsector Issues.  There are many interrelated instittional and technical
weaknesses affecting the subsector, including: (a) inadequate road maintenance, due partly to
a lack of understanding of the economic role of maintna    and to insufficient funding;
(b) inefficient practices in the selection of road works resulting in uneconomic investment, and
similar practices in preparation and implementation that lead to a product of poor quality and
short economic life; (c) shortage of sklcled technical staff and inadequate training programs;
(d) weak institutions, especially at kabupaten and provincial levels; and (e) inadequate attention
being paid to environmental impacts in the planning and implemention of road works. In
addition, although road transport is responsive tc demand and is relatively inexpensive, there are
issues affecting its efficiency. These weaknesses are due mainly to the slow progress in



-2-
modernizing road transport laws and regulations and improving their administration. Also there
is a need to increase and restructure road user taxation.
5.          GOI Objectives and Strategy. In recent years, GOI has consistently placed
importance on the transportation sector as a key means of promoting economic growth and
regional development. Within the road subsector, GOI's main objectives are to achieve a higher
density of kabupaten roads and to raise the stable proportion of the network (defined as
kilometers of roads in good and fair condition). GOI has in the recent past, therefor: provided
a consistent annual level of funding for preparation and implementation of kabupaten road
programs. In addition, substantia steps have been taken by GOI to increase the capacity and
accountability of kabupaten governments, and to improve systems and procedur'-s for road
planning, design, and implementation. Since 1989, GOI has also been implementing an action
plan agreed with the Bank to improve, in particular, the efficiency of road transport. A few of
the major steps included in this plan are the formulation of a strategy to improve road user
taxation, preparation of new regulations on vehicle weights and dimensions, and the
decentralization of the responsibility for implementing road traffic and transport regulations to
the local governments. Progress on the action plan is satisfactory although below original
expectations, and it will be addressed further under the proposed Second Highway Sector loan.
One of the major thrusts of the Second Highway Sector Loan will be to restructure road user
taxation.
6.          Lending Experience.  To date the Bank has financed kabupaten roads
development projects in 11 provinces. Other donors include ADB, which assists all the
kabupatens in the four provinces from Central Java to Bali; USAID, which assists seven
kabupatens in South Sulawesi and two in Nusa Tenggara; and OECF, which has assisted
kabupatens in most of the rest of Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi
7.          The Bank bas financed 12 projects to date in the road sector, including three
kabupaten roads development projects (FY82, FY88 and FY92). Lessons learned from the
kabupaten roads projects include the following: (a) kabupatens' planning procedures need much
improvement; (b) due to the small, highly dispersed road subprojects, supervision by GOI and
by the Bank needs to be more intensive than on a typical highway project if acceptable quality
standards are to be met; (c) kabupatens tend to allocate insufficient fimds for road maintenance;
and (d) sustainable institutional improvements in the kabupatens require significant effort from
both the central government and from foreign donors over a long period of time, possibly
through repeater projects. These lessons have been taken into account in the design of the
project.
8.          Rationale for Bank Involvement. The main reasons for Bank involvement in
kabupaten road improvement programs are the following: (a) improved access is a prerequisite
for most development activities in rural areas and is particularly important to reduce rural
poverty; (b) a sizeable part of GOI's development budget is now aimed at improving kabupaten
roads and it is important that these funds be used as efficiently as possible and that the
environmentl impacts be addressed systematically; (c) Bank involvement can help GOI induce
local governments to give priority to road maintenance rather than to new construction or to
betterment projects; and (d) the Bank can provide assistance to GOI in the formulation and
implementation of institutional and technical improvements at subsector level.

9.          Bank Strategy. The importance of infrastructure in promoting economic growth
and sustaining private sector development has been recognized by GOI. The provision of
infrastructure has also been seen as a tool for ach;eving more equitable development a.ros.
regions and income groups in Indonesia. The proposed project fits well with the GOI strategy.
In view of the assignment of sector management responsibilities in Indonesia, Bank strategy ir
the road sector makes a distinction in the focus of lending operations for the primary network
(national and provincial roads) and !hose for the kabupaten roads. Projects that support
development of the primary network attempt to improve road transport incentives and regulations
as well as address the more complex technical and organizational issues. The focus under
kabupaten roads projects is more on institutional development, maintenance, and resource
allocation at the local levels. This project is designed, therefore, to: (a) help GOI, and hence
the local level agencies, focus on improving organization, systems, procedures, and
implementation methods through its technical assistance components; (b) introduce these
improvements on a large scale through civil works components; (c) help develop local
capabilities for project monitoring and supervision, and (d) help GOI develop and implement
substantial training programs.
10.        Project Objectives. The objectives of the project are to enhance the capability
of GOI agencies that manage the development of kabupaten roads, and to improve the quality
and the capacity of the road network in selected kabupatens in Eastern Indonesia on a sustainable
basis. The project would incr:ease the access of the population in project provinces to
commercial centers.
I1.        Project Concept. The project represents largely an extension of the Third
Kabupaten Roads Project (KR3) to the eastern region. In this sease it is starting with an already
agreed analytical, organizational, and conditionality framework and taking it further. For
example, considerable attention will be placed on developing procedures in the Directorate
General of Highways (DGH) and in the Provinces for the conduct and review of Environmental
Impact analyses, including consultation with people affected by road projects. A part of this task
will be integrated with the special planning procedures begun under KR3. The proposed project
would also include a component for adapting and disseminating better road works technologies.
12.        Project Description. The project would have the following main components:
(i) civil works, including rehabilitation of selected roads in project kabupatens (US$146.4
million); (ii) routine and periodic maintenance (US$121.7 million); (iii) provision of a minimum
of equipment, spare parts, and supplies (US$25.8 million); (iv) training, including continuation
of the five-year training program started under KR3 (US$3.2 million); and (v) consultants'
supervision seryices (US$24.5 million) total, and technical assistance for continuing the
strengthening of systems and procedures for road planning, environmental analysis, and
technology dissemination (US$9.7 million). The project's total cost would be about US$331.3
million including contingencies, and implementation would cover three GOI fiscal years, starting
in FY93/94. A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in schedule A. Amounts
and methods of procurement and disbursements are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key
project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Indonesia are given in
schedule C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report
No. 11385-IND, dated March 1, 1993, is being distributed separately.
13.        Implementation. The project will be implemented mainly by the kabupaten public
works units with support from the provincial and central governments. DGH will be the



-4 -
execu.ting agency. GOI's normal institutional mecbanisms (including funding through the Inpres,
or central government allocations to kabupatens) will be used. All periodic maintenance,
rehabilitation and improvement works, and at least 50 percent of routine maintenance works will
be executed by contractors. Experience has shown that these arrangements are effective in
providing sufficient capacity to implement the project.
14.         Agreed Actions. GOI has agreed to: (a) cause each project kabupaten to prepare
its annual road maintenance program in accordance with the methodology and criteria agreed to
by the Bank, and submit this program for the Bank's review and comments by December 31
each year; (b) cause each project kabupaten to do the same as in (a) above for its annual
rehabilitation and improvement works program; (c) submit for the Bank's review and comments
its annual program for in-house delivery of training programs, and finalize and implement this
program taking into account the comments, If aay, by the Bank; (d) maintain the project
secretariat, and the Project Implementation Unit, both established under XR3, for the duration
of the project; (e) package civil works contracts in accordance with criteria satisfactory to the
Bank; and (f) strengthen the DGH section that will carry out environmental assessments, to
protect the rights of Indigenous Peoples in project areas and to ensure that Indigenous Peoples
are involved in the preparation and implementation of the relevant subprojects financed by the
project. GOI will take measures to avoid or mitigate adverse effects of the project on Indigenous
Peoples and will, in addition, set up an independent team to monitor performance in this regard.
GO will also take steps to strengthen the environmental assessment review capacity at the
Bappeda (Provincial) level. Finally, it was also agreed that adequate budgetary provisions will
be made by GOI for the purchase of vehicles prior to any disbursement under the project's road
rehabilitation component.
15.         Environmental Inpact. Based on the findings of the environmental assessment
that was completed for the project, most road works would have only minor impacts on the
environment which are to be mipated through the use of environmental guidelines for design
and implementation. Proposed projects with possible significant impacts, as identified by the
environmental screening process, would be submitted to a detailed environmental assessment
(EA) in accordance with GOI procedures and criteria agreed to by the Bank. Ihe project
includes technical assistance support for this purpose. The EA would be reviewed by the Bank,
and only road works for which there is no doubt that the impacts are mitigated adequately would
be accepted for Bank financing. No road works would be eligible for Bank financing if they
provide access to any area where induced development might have significant indirect
environmental impacts. The project does not involve any resettlement or significant land
acquisition.
16.        Program Objectve Categories. The main contribution of the project will be to
basic infrastructure development and public sector management, through the improvements
expected in road network quality, in the subsector's insional and technical framework, and
in the capability of kabupaten road staff. The project will also contribute to poverty reduction
objectives by providing access to commercial centers for the population living in some of the
poorest provinces of Indonesia and will introduce practical methods to Identify and control the
potential environmental impacts of kabupaten road works.
17.         Project Benefits. Rehabilitation and improved mant ce of roads would lead
to a reduction of vehicle opemting costs in project kabupatens. lThis would be particularly
significant since trucks and other heavier vehicles consist of about one-half of the fleet in the



-  -
eastern region. Lower road transport costs would translate into lower costs of consumables and
agricultural inputs, and higher production and rural incomes. In some kabupatens the project may
help in the transformation of subsistence agriculture, as road improvements could foster the
marketing of surplus production. In addition, the project would increase kabupatens' ability to
plan and implement road works programs efficiently, thereby reducing further the costs of road
provision and road use.
18.          ;isks. The main project risks are relatd to the implementation of the planning
procedures and the funding of maintece. Partly because of the limited capacity of the
agencies in charge of assisting and supervising kabupatens, the implemention of the planning
procedures is inconsistent in some kabupatens, and road investments are not properly prioritized.
To reduce this risk, GOrs national planning agency, Bappenas, would continue to play a strong
coordinating role and project implementation reviews would be held at regular intervals. As for
maintenance, some project kabupatens may be reluctant to increase their ellocations of funds for
maintenance as much as needed to fulfill project targets. In response to this, Bappenas has
agreed to the use of Inpres funds for road maintenance to meet a kabupaten's target, if needed.
Also, GOI would disqualify any kabupaten that has not implemented its previous year's
maitnmce program from being eligible for using rehabilitation/improvement proceeds from
the proposed loan.
19.         SustainabiDty. Theproject represents an attempt to utilizethe resources available
to kabupatens more efficiently and effectively. It pursues difficult objectives such as developing
the planning and institutional capability in kabupatens so as to enable them to main  viable
road networks. It will also try to encourage the use of more appropriate road rehabilitation and
maintenance technologies. Taken together, this is a sustainable package as it will increasingly
be the more economically justified investments that are completed, and the appropriate conditions
for adequate maintenance of the network fostered. Implementation of the project's training and
institutional strengthening omponents are also important to long-term sustainability.
20.         Retroactive Flnandng. Retroactive financing for some civil works and essential
consulting services, not to exceed US$15 million, is recommended for expenditures incurred
after January 1, 1993, and before the date of the loan agreement. This advance procurement is
considered necessary to expedite implementation of the first-year program.
21.         Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan.
