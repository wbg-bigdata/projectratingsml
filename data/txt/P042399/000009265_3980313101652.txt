1. THE ENERGY SECTOR
A. ENERGY SOURCES AND USES
1.01  The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is short of energy resources. It has
lignite, which is mostly used to generate electricity, and hydropower; which together are
sufficient to make the country more or less self-sufficient in electricity, though it
exchanges electricity with surrounding countries. There is also extensive use of firewood.
Altogether domestic energy sources are about 60% of energy supplies. The country
totally lacks oil, gas or high quality coal resources and as a result imports around 40% of
its energy consumption. Most of these imports are crude oil when the refinery is running
or petroleum products when the refinery is not running. There are also normally small
imports of coke for the steel mills and the country is just beginning the importation of
Russian Natural Gas. Over the period 1990-96 energy imports amounted to about 11-
16% of total imports depending on the strength of the economy and any build-up or run-
down of inventories which may be occurring.
1.02 The energy balances available for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
concentrate on sources of energy and provide very limited information on energy use.
The table below shows the sources of energy for 1996. In that year about 41% of energy
was imported, mostly petroleum products. The main domestic sources of energy are: 1)
lignite, which is primarily used to generate electricity; 2) firewood, which is used
extensively by households for heating and cooking; and 3) hydropower. Hydropower in
1996 was about 4.8% of energy supply and 23% of electricity production (5.2x1o TJ).

B. ENERGY INTENSITY/CONSERVATION
1.03   The economy of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is more energy
intensive than most West European Countries, though not as energy intensive as those
countries which were members of the former Soviet bloc. For example the ratio of GDP
($) produced to energy consumed (kilograms of oil equivalent) is about 1.5 $/Kg in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia compared with 3-6 which would be typical of
Western Europe or 0.4-0.6 which would be typical of Eastern Europe. Energy
intensiveness in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is due to four primary
factors. First, the share of industry in GDP or GSP is relatively high, which is true of
most ex-socialist countries. Second, much of the industry is inherently quite energy
intensive including steel, non-ferrous metals, and cement. Third, the industries in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia use less energy efficient technology than their
Western counterparts. Finally, houses are poorly insulated.
1.04   Thus, the potential for energy conservation in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia is substantial and has been recognized by the Government. As the economic
transition continues, companies are being privatized and budget constraints are becoming
harder for the remaining Government owned companies. As a result, industries are now
becoming very conscious of their energy costs and have developed a number of larger
energy saving investments. Financing of these investments, however, is a problem due to
the poor condition of the Macedonian Banking System and uncertainty about the long run
viability of some of the companies involved. In fact, these investments should generally
not be undertaken until it is clear that the companies involved are financially viable in a
market economy.
1.05   Also since 1988, the Government has had a modest program, administered by the
Ministry of Economy, to increase energy efficiency. This program consists of a
competition held twice a year, where enterprises compete to receive small government
loans on favorable terms for energy saving investments. However, most investments in
industry are too large for the above program.
C. SECTORORGANIZATION
1.06 The energy sector is currently largely owned by the Government, with the
principal sectoral companies being: the power company, Elektrostopanstvo na
Makedonija (ESM); the Skopje Refinery; the Skopje District Heating Company; and
Makpetrol (the petroleum products distribution company). ESM is wholly and directly
owned by the Government, while the majority of the shares in the Refinery and Skopje
District Heating Company are socially owned with a small share holding by the
employees. These socially owned shares are left from the previous SFRY self-
management system. They are owned by the Government, which can sell them, but the
companies are self-managing. Makpetrol, on the other hand, is now more than half



3
privately owned and is officially an independent company. Government controls over the
energy sector are shared by several ministries and differ somewhat between the various
entities. The key institutional relationships are as follows:
* The Council of Ministers sets prices of petroleum products and electricity and is
expected to approve natural gas prices. It makes top management appointments
for ESM and ratifies major investments by ESM.
* The Ministry of Economy has principal oversight responsibility for the energy
sector and reviews and approves the investment plans of ESM. It recommends
to the Council of Ministers the tariffs for electricity and petroleum product
prices, based upon the proposals of the interested companies. It will set natural
gas prices, subject to the approval of the Council'of Ministers. In the special
case of district heating prices, the Ministry can approve these prices without the
intervention of the Council of Ministers. It is involved in the selection of top
management for ESM.
* The Ministry of Development reviews and comments on major investment
plans, especially those of ESM. This review is mostly to see that the plans are
consistent with the overall investment plan of the country and with the country's
potential financing capacity from internal and external sources. It can also
review and comment on pricing proposals.
3 The Ministry of Finance can review and comment on pricing proposals and
reviews and comments on investments when Government Guarantees are
required for debt financing.
1.07    The general procedure in the sector to obtain approval for an increase in prices
(except for district heating, see above) is first for the sectoral company to submit a formal
request with a detailed explanation. The proposed price increase goes to the Ministry of
Economy for review with other Ministries commenting on it if they choose. After this
review, the request is sent to the Council of Ministers for action. This system has worked
satisfactorily in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, since the Council of
Ministers has generally acted responsibly. Moreover electricity prices, perhaps the most
important prices, are set under a loan agreement between the EBRD and the Government
to which the Council of Ministers has generally adhered.
-1.08 The Government needs overtime to privatize the sectoral companies (along with
most of the industry of the country). The first step has been taken with the recent
privatization of Makpetrol through a management and employee buy-out. The refinery
should also be privatized if that is feasible given its uncertain outlook. Less urgently, the
three "natural monopolies", the Skopje District Heating Company, ESM and the gas
transmission and distribution company should be privatized. As these companies are
being privatized the Government needs to ensure an adequate and transparent regulatory



4
mechanism and facilitate the development of competition especially in petroleum
retailing and in power generation. (See below.)
D. LEGISLATION
1.09    Two key pieces of legislation that affect the energy sector are the Energy Law
and the Law on Public Enterprises. The Energy Law, which has just been passed by
Parliament, establishes a basis for the operation of energy companies, though it is very
broad (covering all energy) and somewhat vague on important issues while very specific
on other minor issues. Nevertheless it clearly establishes the important principle that all
activities in the energy sector can be carried out by both public and private, foreign and
domestic individuals and organizations, though licenses would be required. Specifically
it allows these individuals and organizations to engage in production, transmission and
distribution of electricity as well as natural gas and petroleum. It also requires, inter alia,
the Government to establish and implement a methodology for setting electricity prices.
1.10 The Government, especially the Ministry of Economy, will be heavily involved in
drawing up regulations to implement the Energy Law. The Ministry is currently working
on a cost-based methodology for setting electricity prices, which it would implement
through a regulation approved by the Council of Ministers. It is also working on
regulations which would deal with the pricing system which ESM would use to pay for
the electricity it purchases from independent power producers ( IPPs) or the prices IPPs
would pay for using ESM's transmission network. This is important since there is
significant potential for IPPs both in the form of small scale hydropower plants and in the
form of cogeneration from industrial facilities. This potential has not, however, been
exploited and needs to be encouraged. This project therefore seeks to encourage IPPs by
reaching agreement with the Government that it will adopt regulations under the Energy
Law acceptable to the Bank governing the operations of IPPs by December 31,1998.
Furthermore, a GEF project is under preparation which would provide grant funding to
allow the development of two or three small hydropower sites to serve as pilot IPPs.
1.11 The Law on Public Enterprises regulates various aspects of these enterprises
including: 1) management, 2) statutes, 3) financial reporting, 4) regulations regarding
strikes, and 5) state control over public enterprises. Public enterprises are autonomous
organizations and can be organized as joint stock companies. If they are organized in that
manner they can have minority private ownership. They are also separate legal entities
which can own assets and have liabilities. They are to be financially independent and not
funded by the Government budget. They have a Managing Board, a General Manager
and a Supervisory Board. The Government appointed Managing Board is the chief
governing and decision making body of the enterprise. These provisions are consistent
with those in many other countries and do not pose any major issues.

2. ELECTRIC POWE
A. GENERAL
2.01    Electricity is the most important form of energy used in the country with the
majority of the population using it not only for lighting and cooking, but also to a
significant extent for heating. Production of electricity in 1996 was 6.17 Twh with 4.73
Twh supplied by thermal power plants and 1.44 Twh supplied by hydropower plants -
mainly for peaking. Domestic consumption of electricity was 5.2 Twh and losses, most
of which were in distribution were .785 Twh. There were also small net exports. Of the
total consumption, 2.5 Twh or 48% were sales to households while the rest were sales
primarily to industry but also commerce and government. Of the total sales of electricity
to industry, around 1.5 Twh are at high voltage to the largest industrial companies. There
are 12 of these companies and they include steel plants, non-ferrous metals plants,
chemical works, the refinery etc. The rest of the industrial sales as well as sales to
government and commerce are at lower voltage. The system is winter peaking, due to the
use of electricity for heating, with a peak in 1996 of 1145 MW and a minimum load of
334MW.
B. BACKGROLIND
2.02    Consumption of electricity in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
grew until the early part of this decade. Over the entire period 1970-1996 the growth rate
was 4.2%, while for the shorter period of 1983 to 1996 it was only 1.0%. During the past
several years, moreover, electricity consumption has grown very slowly as the country
entered a period of rapid economic contraction due to major external shocks - mostly
connected to the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation. These included losses of annual
transfers from the central Government which had amounted to 5-10% of GSP, loss of
foreign exchange reserves totaling over $1 billion held at the Central Bank in Belgrade,
and the loss of export markets due to the economic sanctions imposed by the UN on the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). This was aggravated by the
Greek embargo in 1994-95 which disrupted trade. These factors lead to major
dislocations in the economy with a drop in GDP of about 30% between 1990 and 1995.
Electricity consumption, however, did not decline anywhere near as much as GDP in part
because of a shift towards use of electricity (which is domestically produced) and away
from petroleum products (which are imported) as the latter became less available and
more expensive. The economy hit bottom in 1995 and began to recover in 1996.
Moreover, electricity consumption began to recover even before the economy and rose in
both 1995 and 1996, by about 3% per year. Most of the increase in consurnption came
from households and other low voltage consumers, the latter consisting mostly of small
industries and commercial establishments.

C. FIMJURE DEMAND
2.03    Electricity consumption is related to the growth of the economy, but is also
impacted by external factors. Assuming the economy continues to recover and restructure
and there are no further shocks, a reasonable assumption for GDP growth might be
around 4-5% a year from 1998 to 2005. Initially electricity growth may tend to keep pace
with GDP growth as industrial output rises and household incomes improve. In the
intermediate term, however, electricity growth should be slower than GDP growth for at
least three reasons. First, the structure of the economy should shift away from heavy
industry especially metals, to lighter industry, agriculture and services and this shift
should accelerate over time. Second, the remaining heavy industry should become more
efficient in its use of electricity and energy due to the increase in energy prices, continued
enforcement of hard budget constraints and the impact of privatization. Finally, the
creation of a gas distribution system in Skopje , around the turn of the century, will shift
about 50,000 households mostly from electric heating to gas heating. It will also cause
some commercial and Governmental establishments to shift from electricity to gas.
While the exact size of this shift is unkmown, the creation of the gas distribution system
could reduce electricity consumption by around 0.5-.7 Twh. Taking these factors into
account ESM's estimates of growth for the period 1997-2005 of around 3-4% in the
nearer term slowing to 1.5-2.0% after 2002 would appear reasonable, though there are
significant uncertainties involved in all of the assumptions above, especially the GDP
forecast. ESM's forecasts are summarized in Table 2.2.

D. GEATINGCAPACI
2.04    Available electricity generating capacity in the country consists of 1431 MW
which belongs to and is operated by ESM, around 3 MW of hydropower capacity
belonging to irrigation organizations and about 39 MW of oil-fired cogenerating capacity
in four plants in the industrial sector (see Annex 2-1). This cogeneration capacity is
currently not in use. Furthermore, in order to settle its debts to ESM, Zelezara has given
ESM its cogenerating plant. ESM is considering converting this plant to natural gas and
putting it back into service. ESM's capacity (excluding the Zelezara plant) consists of
386 MW of larger hydropower plants, 40 MW of smaller hydropower plants and 1005
MW of thermal plants (see Table 2.3 below). One thermal plant, Bitola, dominates base
load electricity supply producing typically around 4 Twh or close to 70% of current
Macedonian electricity supply. The Mavrovo cascade, especially the Vrutok hydropower
plant, is the country's largest hydropower system producing about 0.5 Twh or a little
under half of the hydropower. This is overwhelmingly used for peaking purposes. The
major power plants are given in Tables 2.3 below.

2.05   Mjor Generating Unita. The major generating units in the country are described
briefly below.
2.06   The BITQLA power plant and adjacent mine is the biggest energy complex in
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It is located close to the town of Bitola in
the southern part of the country. The power plant, with 675 MW of capacity, is a little
under half the generating capacity in the country, but typically supplies about 70% of
country electricity needs. This is because it: 1) is a base load plant, 2) uses local fuels
and thus is little effected by trade disruptions, and 3) is relatively new with good
availability. The power plant units were commissioned in 1982, 1984 and 1988 as
Russian units of 210 MW. However, at fairly low cost, the plant expanded them to 225
MW units. The adjacent open-pit mine, Suvudol, produces about 6 million tonnes of
lignite per year which mostly supplies the power plant. Lignite reserves at the Suvudol
mine are adequate to last about 20 years. The plant is generally in good condition and
well maintained.



9
2.07  The NEGOTINO thermal power plant, located close to the town of Negotino,
was constructed in 1978 and designed for two units of 210 MW each. The first unit was
completed in March 1978 and the second unit was never started. The plant was designed
to burn heavy fuel oil (9600 kcal/kg) but could be converted to natural gas (8000
kcal/m3) at low cost. For the past four years the plant was shut down due first to the lack
of heavy fuel oil (during the Greek Embargo) and then to its relatively high cost.
Currently it is on cold stand-by.
2.08 The OSLOMEJ power plant and lignite mine are located in the Western part of
the country and have been in operation since 1980. The mine produces about 1.1 million
tonnes of lignite per year which is used in the power plant which has one unit of 120
MW capacity. There is little potential for expansion at this time due to the limited life of
the mine.
2.09 The MAVROVO hydro scheme (also called Tito-Gostivar) is composed of the
powerhouses Vrutok, Vrben and Raven, the Mavrovo dam and reservoir and a network
of feeder canals to catch the water coming from the nearby mountains. The first power
house in line is Vrben at 12.8 MW. Water emerging from this power house goes into the
multi-year Mavrovo reservoir and then to the two power stations of Vrutok and Raven
that are supplied in series by the same penstock. The capacity of this hydro scheme is
182 MW, which is a little less than half of ESM's installed hydro capacity of 426 MW
(including the small plants). This hydro scheme typically generates around 500 Gwh
about 80% of which comes from the largest plant, Vrutok. Generation from this hydro
scheme is typically just under 50% of the hydropower production in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and is used primarily for peaking purposes. The
powerhouses in this scheme were built back in the 1950's and need to be rehabilitated in
order to increase efficiency and reliability.
2.10  The GLOBOCICA hydro power plant is located in the southwest part of the
country on the Black Drim river, 22 km North of the town of Struga. It has been in
operation since 1965. Installed capacity is 42 MW and average annual output is around
187 Gwh. It also is in need rehabilitation.
2.11 The TIKVES hydro power plant is located on the Black River, not far from
Kavadarci. The two first units have been in operation since 1968, and units 3 and 4
since 1981. Total installed capacity is 92 MW, and average annual generation is about
185 Gwh. The plant is primarily used for peaking purposes, though it is also run when
irrigation water is needed downstream. Due to age, it is in need of rehabilitation.
2.12   The SPILJE hydro power plant is located on the Black Drim river downstream
of Globocica. In operation since 1969, its installed capacity is 70.2 MW and the average
annual generation is around 300 Gwh. The Derbar reservoir behind the Spilje dam has
moderate storage capacity and the plant operates both as a base load unit and for peaking
purposes. Again some rehabilitation is required.

E. IRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUITIQN
2.13   While the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was part of Yugoslavia, its
power system was part of Yugoslavia's electric utility association, JUGEL; which in turn
was part of the Western European Electricity network, UCPTE. Thus, ESM was not
designed to be a self sufficient utility but rather part of a regional (JUGEL) and
international system (UCPTE). It would still gain very significantly from being part of a
regional system and eventually re-establishing the physical link with UCPTE', which is
currently severed because of the Yugoslav Civil War. An embryonic and informal
regional system seems to be developing with Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia all coordinating and exchanging power. However, a well developed, formal
system has not been established and in the short to intermediate term it is likely that the
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's Power System will not be part of a larger
fully integrated electricity network and thus it will continue to need more domestic
reserve capacity to provide spinning reserves and frequency control. Thus the role of the
major hydropower plants, which provide peaking capacity, frequency control and
spinning reserves, is further enhanced.
2.14   The Macedonian Dispatch Center was also designed to function as part of a
regional and international system. More specifically it was one of the eight dispatch
centers in the republics and provinces of Yugoslavia which worked in conjunction with
the pool or Federation Dispatch Center in Belgrade, which in turn coordinated with
UCPTE. An energy management system (EMS), financed by the Bank (Loan 2338-
YU), was under construction for the integrated Yugoslav System when the Yugoslav
Civil War broke out. As a result of the civil war the integrated Yugoslav System
disappeared and now the Skopje dispatch center has to function in isolation. To do this
most efficiently it needs some additional hardware, software and telecommunications
equipment to improve control over and communication with the power plants especially
with the hydropower plants.
2.15   On the whole the Macedonian Transmission system is in acceptable condition.
The backbone of the system is the 400 KV line crossing the country from FR Yugoslavia
to Greece and which linked Greece to UCPTE. In total there are 256 Km of 400 KV
lines, 165 Km of 220 KV lines and 1500 km of 110 KV lines. A new transmission line
from Bitola to Skopje, financed by EBRD, has recently been finished.
2.16   On the other hand, the distribution system in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia is overloaded. It was built some years ago and carries more electricity than it
was designed for. As a result, distribution losses, at 12-13% of distribution sales, are

quite high. It also needs rehabilitation starting with replacing some of the distribution
transformers.
F. ELECTRICIT  WPR-ICES
2.17   Electricity prices are set by the Government, but taking into account agreements
with the IFIs on this issue. More specifically electricity prices are set by the Council of
Ministers based on a request from ESM, through the Ministry of Economy. Under an
EBRD Loan to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia a target pattern of real
electricity price increases in German Marks (DEM) has been established which is then
reinforced under the Bank's FESAC Credit. The Cabinet has generally adhered to these
agreements. Expressed in German Pfennigs, the average electricity price rose from 5.9
Pfennigs/Kwh in 1994 to 6.1 Pfennigs in 1995 and to 6.55 in 1996. While prices rose
about 10% in Denar terms in 1997, due to the devaluation of the Denar the average
electricity price in Pfennigs actually declined slightly. EBRD is concerned about this
since their covenant is to increase the price to 7.5 Pfennigs/Kwh and maintain it at that
level. This price (7.5 Pfennigs/Kwh) is 4.2-5.4 US cents/Kwh depending on the
Dollar/Mark exchange rate. While no study of long run marginal costs has yet been done,
based on ESM's relatively low operating costs (around 3.5-4.0 US cents/Kwh) and the
lack of need in the near term for additional generating capacity, it would appear that this
price of 7.5 Pfennigs is probably not far from long run marginal costs. ( See para. 4.05).
2.18    The Macedonian tariff system is consistent with principles of economic pricing
with differentiation by time of day, season, and voltage level and including capacity and
energy charges. It also avoids one mistake that is standard in ex-socialist countries. This
mistake is charging households and commercial establishments substantially less for
electricity than industry, even though it costs more to supply them. In the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia households and commercial establishments are in fact
charged more than industry. For example in 1996 the average price for electricity
supplied to the largest industries, that is industries that receive electricity directly from
the high voltage grid, was 0.93Dn/Kwh compared with an average price of 1.80 Dn/Kwh
for households.
2.19    Households/Poyety Electricity represents about 4-5%  of expenditures by
households in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Almost all households are
connected to the grid and electricity is overwhelmingly used for lighting and is the most
common means of cooking. Electricity is less used for heating , with a substantial part of
the heat used by households being provided by burning firewood or in Skopje by the
Skopje District Heating System. While electricity is thus an important consumer item, the
Government has not felt it necessary to provide special subsidies in this area. Rather the
Government has relied on a social safety net consisting of redundancy payments,
unemployment benefits, means tested income support and pensions. The possibility
exists, however, that the Government might want to introduce a lifeline tariff system and
this would depend largely on whether the Government decides that a lifeline tariff
system would provide better targeting of subsidies to the very poor.



12
G. ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES
2.20   Role of Government. The power sector currently operates as a public monopoly,
with ESM as the principal entity. As such it is classified as a public enterprise and falls
under state control. The extent of state control is principally in the areas of investment
planning, management selection and pricing. These activities are spread over several
ministries and the Council of Ministers as described in para. 1.06 above.
2.21   Sector Organization. The Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, with the assistance of USAID, had a study undertaken of the organization of
the electricity sector. This study was done by Arthur Andersen and Bechtel and looked
primarily at the issue of whether the system should be unbundled or not. Their conclusion
was that given the very small size of the system and the dominant role played by the
Bitola power plant, unbundling is difficult and may not be suitable. These conclusions are
appropriate. The primary benefit from unbundling is normally the creation of competition
among power plants or groups of power plants to supply electricity. However, in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia there is one dominant power plant (Bitola),
which would set the price and there would be little competition. There does appear,
however, to be a useful role for IPPs in providing power and as benchmarks for gauging
the efficiency of ESM and Bitola. Under this project IPP's would be encouraged (see
para. 1.10).
2.22   Company Organization and Staffing. ESM has a General Manager, a Managing
Board and an Advisory Board. The General Manager or Chief Executive Officer is
appointed by the Government for a 4 year term. The Managing Board, which replaced the
Workers Council under the old structure, consists of 11 persons of which 7 are appointed
by the Government and four are Government approved employees of ESM including the
General Manager. This Managing Board is the chief governing and decision making
body of the enterprise. There is also an Advisory Board, appointed by the General
Manager to assist with the economic running of the enterprise and consisting of the top 7
officials of the company.
2.23   The organization, prior to downsizing included 8,626 employees. This number of
employees was too high for a utility the size of ESM, even taking into account the fact
that it mines its own coal. The company has now downsized under commitments in the
FESAC project. This downsizing eliminated about 600 jobs in non-core activities,
through spin-offs and layoffs, and another 400 jobs are being eliminated through early
retirements and restrictions on hiring.
Comparisons
2.24   The table below compares various performance indicators for the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's Power System with two of its neighbors, Thailand
and proposed Bank "Targets" for those indicators. The former Yugoslav Republic of



13
Macedonia's system compares favorably with the "targets" in terms of losses ( due to low
transmission losses offsetting high distribution losses) and population served. The low
load factor relative to the "target" level, cannot be rapidly changed because of the high
household winter demand for electric heating. The return on assets needs to be improved,
but cash flow is substantially better than would be indicated by the low return on assets
due to a high level of depreciation.

H. INVESTMENINS
2.25 An investment program was prepared by ESM and endorsed by the Government.
This investment program includes two main categories; a) rehabilitation/ completion of
existing systems, b) construction of new capacity.
2.26   Rehabilitation and life extension of the hydro plants is given the highest priority
by both ESM and the Government. This is because the hydropower plants are generally
fairly old, older than most of the thermal generation capacity, and a significant part of
their equipment is wearing out or is now obsolete with spare parts difficult to obtain.
Furthermore these plants play a vital role in the Macedonian Power System, providing
peaking capacity, reserve capacity and frequency control. (See para. 2.13.) In addition
two other areas are in need of rehabilitation/completion. These are the Energy



14
Management System (EMS) which needs to be completed and which, as was indicated in
para. 2.14 above, was begun under an earlier Bank Project and the distribution system
which is overloaded.
2.27   Based on ESM's demand forecasts new generating plants are probably not needed
for about 12 years though a lot of additional capacity may be needed in the second decade
of the next century. If only one unit at Negotino operates then additional capacity would
be needed by around 2003. If a second unit is installed at Negotino then a new plant
would not be needed until around 2009.
2.28   In the longer term, ESM has proposed to add additional hydropower capacity in
the form of dams with powerhouses on major rivers, primarily the Vardar and its
tributaries. These hydropower plants would be part of an overall development program
for the Vardar River and tributaries. These plants are, however, a very expensive way to
generate electricity - usually $1000 - $2000/Kw for capacity with limited generation
because of limited water supplies. While the hydropower plants have not been evaluated
in terms of a least cost plan, they would probably not be least cost based on their power
generation characteristics alone. Their justification, if at all, has to be based rather on a
cost benefit analysis of their multiple uses including generation, irrigation, flood control
and municipal water supply. This has not been done. Also since the Vardar river flows
2
into Greece, agreement would need to be reached with Greece on the use of the water.
(See Annex 2-1 for technical characteristics of proposed hydropower, candidate, plants).
I. RATIQNAFlOERB BINOLVMENT
2.29   The Bank's Countr Assistance Strategy (iCAS) for The Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia ( Report 14379-MK) in 1995, recognized the importance of a
power sector rehabilitation project for the country. More specifically it identified
rehabilitation of infrastructure as one of the priority areas for Bank lending indicating that
"Bank financing would be targeted to investment projects aiming to arrest the
deterioration of key infrastructure (power, water supply)" and specifically mentions a
power project in this context. The Energy Sector Review for The Former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia (Report 15313-MK), was even more specific indicating that
rehabilitation of hydro-power plants and completion of the dispatch center had the highest
priority in the energy sector. Beginning the rehabilitation of the Macedonian distribution
system was also given a high priority. These views are completely in agreement with
those of the Macedonian Government which in both 1995 and 1996 assigned highest
priority to rehabilitation of the hydropower plants in order to prevent black outs and
brown outs.
2/ The SFRY had an agreement with Greece on the Vardar River, but this agreement does not necessarily
extend to former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

J. BANK EXPERICE IN THE SECTOR AND LESSONS LEARNED
2.30   This project would be the Bank's first project in the Energy Sector of the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. However, the Bank has done a large number of energy
and power projects in other countries. One of the major lessons learned is that the
conditionality must be simple and closely related to the project. Also the design of the
project should be simple with a limited set of objectives. In addition the Bank published
in 1993 a policy paper entitled The World Bank's Role in the Electric Power Sector.
Two of the most important recommendations were: 1) "Bank lending for electric power
will focus on countries with a clear commitment to improving sector performance;" and
2) "the Bank will ...support programs that will facilitate the involvement of private
investors." The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a country which has a strong
commitment to maintaining and improving sector performance and thus a power project
is warranted. Also this project will help to open the Macedonian Power Sector to IPPs
especially to small independent hydropower plants (see para. 1.10).

3. THE PROJECT
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
3.01   This project through rehabilitating hydro-power plants, completing the EMS and
starting the rehabilitation of the distribution system aims to achieve the following
objectives. First, increase the efficiency of hydro-power generation. This would result in
greater hydropower generation for any given amount of water and a resultant reduction in
system costs and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions due to reduced thermal
generation. Secod, expand the generating capacity of the major hydro-power plants
through rehabilitation. This should enable the country to better meet its peak electricity
demands, help stabilize frequency and reduce the likelihood of brown-outs and black-
outs. Third, increase system operating efficiency through completion of a modem Energy
Management System (EMS) that would enable the electric company to optimize
operation of its power generation and transmission facilities thus reducing costs. Fourth,
begin the reduction of the high losses in the electricity distribution system.  Eifth,
facilitate the development of independent power producers (IPPs), with the initial plants
probably being mini-hydro power plants. Finally, facilitate the eventual reintegration of
ESM into UCPTE by improving its system controls.
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
3.02   The project will consist of three components which are:
a) rehabilitation of the six largest hydro-power plants in the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia which represent 91% of the country's hydro-power
capacity;
b) improvement of the EMS for the electricity company including controls,
dispatch center and communications;
c) beginning the rehabilitation of the electricity distribution system.
3.03    Hydropower Plant Rehabilitation (base cost $31.6 Million equivalent). This
component would rehabilitate the six largest hydropower plants in the Macedonian
System. These are Globocica, Spilje, Tikves and the three power plants in the Mavrovo
Cascade ( Vrutok, Raven and Vrben). The investments are to replace worn out equipment
or totally obsolete equipment which is inefficient and for which no spare parts are
available. The rehabilitation of these plants is just getting underway with a Swiss
Government Grant of 5 million Swiss Francs for equipment for the plants in the Mavrovo
Cascade. This project would complete the rehabilitation of the plants. The Bank would
finance equipment and technical assistance as needed. It would also fund software and
measuring equipment for the dam safety unit in ESM. ESM in turn would finance some
equipment installation and limited strengthening/repairs of civil works. These repairs are



17
limited repairs on a tunnel in the Mavrovo Cascade along with other minor repairs of civil
works in powerhouses and channels. The dams are generally in good shape but
depending on further studies some strengthening may be needed at the Mavrovo Dam
which would also be funded by ESM. No new civil works are required.
3.04   Energy Management System This component has three interrelated parts. First,
is modernization of the data acquisition and controls for the Power System, mainly new
remote control units and assistance with installing these units. The second sub-component
is completion of the dispatch center, hardware and software, which was begun under an
earlier Bank project for the Yugoslav Federation. The third sub-component is
improvement of ESM's telecommunications system.
3.05   Distribution This component is small and would just begin the rehabilitation of
the Macedonian distribution system, which has high losses. It is expected that this
component would consist largely of distribution transformers since in many cases the
current Macedonian transformers are overloaded. The complete rehabilitation of the
distribution system would require a second project. ESM has asked the Bank to consider
a distribution project for financing once the current project is under implementation.
C. PROJECT COSTS
3.06   The costs of the project are shown in Table 3.1 below. The costs for rehabilitation
of the hydropower plants were estimated by a Swiss Consulting Firm, Entreprises
Electriques Fribougeoises (EEF). These estimates were made in Swiss Francs and then
converted to dollars. Since much of the equipment is likely to be sourced from Europe,
the Swiss Franc cost estimates are probably more accurate than the dollar estimates.
EFF's overall estimates were similar to those prepared by ESM, though they differed
from ESM on various items. The costs for the Energy Management System (EMS) were
developed by an American specialist and ESM working together. These costs estimates
were prepared in dollars. The costs of the small distribution component are based on
ESM's recent experience purchasing transformers and were initially prepared in DEM.
The cost estimates are in line with international market based prices, but they are mostly
Swiss Franc or DEM costs converted at current exchange rates. If the dollar/Swiss Franc
exchange rate were to change sharply these cost estimates would have to be changed in
dollar terms. (The loan amount need not be changed significantly, however, since it is in
German Marks.)
3.07   About 71% of the project is for the hydropower plant rehabilitation with 19% for
the EMS and 10% for distribution. Contingencies of 12% for inflation and 6% for
physical costs were included. The inflation estimate is based on Bank forecasts and the
standard disbursement schedule shown in Table 3.4. The allowance for physical
contingencies is low because the equipment is mostly replacement parts or off the shelf
purchases. It is expected that ESM will fund all local costs. These are generally some of
the costs of removal of old equipment and installation of new equipment. However,



18
minor civil works are included in local costs, primarily repairs of structures connected
with the rehabilitation of the Mavrovo and Spilje hydropower plants and a modest
amount for strengthening Mavrovo. The estimates exclude any import duties which
would be paid by ESM if due. However, it is expected that the Govenmment will exempt
this high priority national project from import duties as was done for the EBRD
Transmission project.

D. PROJECT FINANCING
3.08 The table below, Table 3.2, shows the project financing. The Bank would finance
the equivalent of $35 Million in foreign exchange for the project. In fact the Loan would
be a Libor-based single currency loan of 61.5 Million DEM. In addition to the Bank
Loan, $3.5 Million equivalent in Swiss Francs would be financed by the Swiss
Government, $0.4 million by a Japanese Grant and $12.8 Million by ESM. Foreign costs
are about 77% of the total project- with 23% local costs. ESM would finance all local
costs. No funding from IDA would be used, though the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia is eligible for IDA..

E. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS
3.09 ESM has some experience with international and Bank procurement due to its
involvement with Bank projects when it was part of the JUGEL System and due to a
recent loan from EBRD for the Bitola-Skopje 400-kV transmission line. Nevertheless,
this experience is quite limited. To mitigate the risk of delay this would pose,
procurement consultants are being selected and will be contracted prior to Board
presentation. (These consultants are being procured according to the Bank Guidelines
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, dated January
1997, including reviews of all documentation by the Bank.) These consultants, combined
with active Bank supervision, would strengthen adequately ESM's capabilities in
international procurement. All goods and services to be financed from the Bank loan
would be procured in ac.cordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Macedonian manufacturers
competing under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would receive preference in
bid evaluation in accordance with Appendix 2 of the Bank's Guidelines for Procurent



20
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits dated January 1995 as revised in January and August
1996.
3.10 Goods and services to be financed by the Bank include mechanical and electrical
equipment and materials for hydro turbine-generator modernization, 35-kV and 1 10-kV
switchgear, protective relays, computer hardware and software, fiber-optic cable, power
and distribution transformers, and various other pieces of equipment. These will be
procured in about 21 procurement packages, mostly through ICB. The majority of these
packages require the supplier to supply and install the equipment; though for a few
packages, where the Macedonians have extensive installation experience, the packages
are for goods only. For small hardware and software contracts, valued at less than
$100,000 per contract and amounting to no more than $0.2 million aggregate,
procurement will be carried out through International Shopping. Installation of Bank
financed items procured under goods contracts and minor civil works to rehabilitate the
Mavrovo Dam will be funded by ESM and carried out by ESM's own crews, or local
contractors following competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. About $3.5
million worth of contracts for mechanical and electrical equipment for the project being
financed under a Swiss grant will be procured under Swiss procedures. Table 3.3 below
shows the proposed procurement arrangements. Full details are given in Annex 3-1.

3.11    For the Bank financed packages, the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents will
be used. All ICB packages for goods and services financed by the Bank will be subject to
the Bank's prior review of procurement documentation.
3.12   A General Procurement Notice for this Project was published in Development
Business Issue 470 of September 16, 1997. A procurement workshop for this Project is
planned after both the hydro-power plant consultants and EMS consultants have been
hired. It is expected that this workshop will occur in connection with the first supervision
mission for the Project.
F. DISBURSEMENTS
3.13    The Bank loan will be disbursed for equipment (under supply and install
contracts) against 100% of foreign expenditures. It will also be disbursed for goods
against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures, (b) 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory
cost) and 85% of local expenditures for other items procured locally. For consultants it
will be disbursed against 100% of the cost of consulting services. Expenditures incurred
after November 3, 1997, up to a maximum of US$ 850,000 equivalent (2.4% of total
loan), would be eligible for retroactive financing. These funds would be for advance
payments for equipment and consultants. The schedule of disbursements for the proposed
Bank Loan is summarized in Table 3.4. It indicates a disbursement period of seven years
from the approval date of the loan. This schedule is based on the Bank's "electric
power" standard disbursement profile for ECA. The physical completion of the project is
expected by December 31, 2004. The closing date of the proposed loan would be June
30, 2005.

3.14   Disbursement for all contracts for goods and equipment (under supply and install
contracts) above US$250,000 would be fully documented. All consulting contracts over
$100,000 (firms) and $50,000 (individuals) would be fully documented. All other
contracts will be disbursed against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). The supporting
documentation will be retained by ESM, and made available for review by Bank
supervision missions and auditors. To facilitate the implementation of the project, ESM
will open and maintain a Special Account with the Central Bank or an acceptable



22
commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The authorized
allocation of the Special Account would be (US$ 2,500,000 equivalent). At the start of
the project, the Special Account deposit will be limited to (US$ 570,000 equivalent) and
the remaining portion of the authorized allocation could be requested only after
cumulative disbursements reach a level of (US$ 3,400,000 equivalent). Withdrawal
applications for the replenishment of the Special Account should be sent to the Bank on a
quarterly basis, or when the balance of the Special Account is equal to about half of the
initial deposit or the authorized allocation, whichever comes first. These applications
would have to be supported by appropriate supporting documentation including a copy of
the monthly bank statement of the Special Account as well as its reconciliation with the
Special Accounts transactions. Agreement was reached that ESM would have the project
account and the Special Account audited and submitted to the Bank six months after the
end of each year. Agreement was also reached for ESM to submit audited financial
statements six months after the end of each year.
G. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS
3.15    Environmental Categoiy  In accordance with OD  4.01 (Environmental
Assessment), the proposed project has been assigned to Category B, since the project will
have little impact on the environment and the little impact it has will be generally
favorable. The project's main environmental impact will be to increase hydropower
production by about 13 Gwh. This extra hydropower generation will replace generation
which would have come from burning fossil fuels, either lignite or heavy fuel oil, both of
which create emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Thus the additional
hydropower production will reduce slightly ESM's overall emissions of carbon dioxide
and sulfur dioxide.
3.16   There is a secondary environmental issue connected with the transformers in the
distribution component. The old transformers which will be replaced contain transformer
oil. ESM has agreed that the oil from these old transformers will be recycled or, if
possible, sent to the refinery for use. ESM reports that the old transformers and oils do
not contain PCBs. Furthermore, it was agreed that the new transformers and oils will not
contain PCBs.
3.17   An assessment of the safety of the dams was carried out by an independent dam
specialist. The consultant's assessment focused mainly on dam safety during exceptional
events in the following respects: (i) safety against overtopping; (ii) safety against
earthquakes; and (iii) safety against internal erosion. The assessment found no major
risks in any of these areas though some further analysis and testing were required on the
Mavrovo Dam since the phreatic line in the downstream shell appears to be high. This
testing has been completed and the analysis of the results will be undertaken this winter at
the University of Skopje and then reviewed by Bank experts. It is possible that this
analysis will indicate further strengthening is required at the Mavrovo Dam. During
negotiations agreement was reached with ESM that any further strengthening of
Mavrovo Dam which the analysis shows is needed, will be undertaken by ESM and



23
completed by December 31, 1998. Agreement was also reached that ESM will maintain,
have inspected and ensure the safety of the four dams involved in the project (Mavrovo,
Spilje, Tikves, Globocica) under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank A review of the
Emergency Preparedness Plan for each dam was also conducted and found satisfactory.
However, a number of recommendations to further enhance safety, covering: review and
improvement of the dam safety regulations, supply of modem instruments and computers
for safety monitoring and analysis of information, and training of staff, have been
provided by the consultant, with the associated estimated costs, incorporated into the
project. Details are provided in Annex 3-2.
H. IMPLEMENTATION/LMONITORING
3.18   The Project Implementation Plan is provided in Annexes 3-1 and 3-3. ESM has
established a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) headed by a Director (Annex 3-3) with
the responsibility for project implementation. The organizational structure and staffing of
this unit have been reviewed by the Bank and the unit is ready to start implementing the
project with some technical assistance. Agreement was therefore reached to maintain the
PIU with its current structure until the end of the project. Moreover, it is important that
ESM engages the services of qualified and experienced consultants to assist in preparing
technical specification, bidding and contractor/vendor selection, and quality assurance.
ESM has selected the consultant to assist with the implementation of the hydropower
plant rehabilitation component and has issued bidding documents to an agreed short list
of consultants for assistance with the Energy Management System.
3.19   This project will be supervised and monitored closely by the Bank especially in
the first two years. Monitoring activities will include reports on the status of the
following performance indicators: project implementation, electricity prices, receivables,
hydropower production, hydropower capacity, and distribution losses. Agreement was
reached with ESM to report progress achieved against these performance indicators
quarterly. Agreement was also reachedfor a mid-term review in December 2000.

4. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
A. FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ESM
4.01    Table 4.1 below provides the highlights of ESM's financial performance over the
past four years. The company earns a modest operating profit. However, the company's
cash flow from operations (operating income plus depreciation) is quite good largely due
to the high level of depreciation. Furthermore, depreciation is adjusted quarterly for
inflation and thus increases regularly. However, for Macedonian accounting purposes,
the modest level of operating profits is then offset by non-operating factors leading to a
very small positive net income which is taxed.

4) According to Macedonian Law not according to international accounting standards.
4.02    The relatively poorer operating results for 1995 were due to the very small
increase in average prices in that year in spite of significant inflation. Normally ESM has
different summer and winter tariffs with winter tariffs being significantly higher than
summer tariffs, which reflects the actual economic costs. In 1994, the company was
allowed to charge winter tariffs during the summer which increased average prices very
sharply. In 1995 this was not allowed and as a result the average electricity price
increased very little in spite of two significant tariff increases in the course of the year. In
1996 both winter and summer tariffs were increased.

4.03   ESM has some non-operating income, mostly net interest income. According to
Macedonian Accounting Standards this non-operating income and the operating profits
are offset by various charges including a charge for future capital investments so that
reported income is very small. According to international accounting standards the
company is considerably more profitable, though financial statements prepared according
to international standards are available only for 1995 and 1996.
4.04   The generally favorable operating results depend heavily on the average level of
electricity prices. These have been increased steadily in order to meet the requirements of
the EBRD Loan Agreement and to be in conformity with the requirements under the
FESAC Agreement with the Bank (see para 2.17). In order to insure adequate funding
for this project and consistency with EBRD, agreement was reached with the
Government and ESM that within one year of the commencement of disbursements under
the loan electricity prices will be set in accordance with a methodology established under
the new Energy Law and the average price of electricity should be not less than 7.5
Pfennigs/Kwh or the price required to meet the financial covenants of para 4.08,
whichever is higher.
4.05   The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and ESM need to develop a long
run least cost electricity supply plan. No such plan exists currently and one is needed for
ESM's capital budgeting purposes, and to estimate its required funding. Also, such a
plan would be needed to determine long run marginal costs (LRMC). During
negotiations agreement was reached with the Government and ESM to prepare this plan
by December 31, 1999.
4.06   Qrleivakles  ESM has a receivables problem. At the end of 1994 accounts
receivable amounted to 1.8 billion Denars, about 25% of revenues. This is after the
company wrote-off 733 million Denars in bad debts during the course of that year. These
receivables are almost wholly owed by state owned enterprises. Households
overwhelmingly pay their bills. In 1995 ESM received payment for most (581 Million
Denars) of the bad debt that it had written off in 1994 in the form of shares in the
enterprises which are not paying their bills. This is clearly better than not receiving
anything but not as good as cash since the value of these shares is uncertain and there is
no ready market for them. Moreover, at the end of 1995 accounts receivable had risen to
2.5 Billion Denars or 31% of revenues, which excludes the shares. This same general
pattern was maintained in 1996. Share holdings rose another 200 million Denars. Also,
ESM's accounts receivable rose to 3.4 Billion Denars ( 34% of revenues) according to
Macedonian accounting standards (where bad and doubtful debts can be written off only
with court permission and after suing the debtors). However, for the 1996 financial
statements produced according to international standards, the international auditors
agreed with ESM that all of the bad or doubtful debt would be wholly or partially written
off depending on the likelihood of collection. This produced a large one- time write-off of
new and old receivables amounting to 650 million Denars and a reduction in accounts
receivable from 3.4 Billion Denars to 2.75 Billion.



26
4.07   This problem of non-payment or payment in shares is consuming a significant
part of the funds generated by the company and could place in jeopardy its capacity to
contribute the funds required to complete the project. For example, about one third of the
funds generated by operations in 1996 were used to finance receivables. To avoid this
problem, agreement was reached with ESM to reduce the ratio of accounts receivable to
revenues each year so that it attains a target level of 18% of annual revenue from sales
within four years. Payment in illiquid and potentially worthless shares also has to be
sharply reduced. Agreement was therefore reached that payments to ESMfor electricity
in the form of shares should be limited to no more than 5% of ESM's revenues from sales.
4.08 To further insure the financial health of the company, agreement was reached that
the company would achieve certain standard financial ratios starting in 1998. These
ratios are: 1) generation of funds from internal sources should be at least 30% of
investments; 2) funds generated from operations (net revenues) should be at least 150%
of debt service; 3) the current ratio must be no less than 1.2.
4.09   Debt/Equity. ESM has a very strong balance sheet. Its accounts payable, short
term debt and long term debt are all quite modest. However, most of the company's long
term debt ( about $44 Million) is in foreign exchange with significant debt repayments in
the next few years. Nevertheless, using the audited 1996 financial statements prepared
according to international accounting standards, all liabilities together are only 9% of the
value of assets with 91% of the value of assets represented by equity.
4.10    Financial Statements ESM  maintains its books according to Macedonian
accounting standards and they are audited by Macedonian Accountants, which find them
satisfactory. As a condition of the EBRD Loan they have also begun to prepare financial
statements according to international standards using one of the big international
accounting firms. (see para 4.06 above). However, the accountants do not express an
opinion on their accuracy. The main concerns of the accountants are: 1) they did not
audit the 1995 Financial Statements (another international auditor did); 2) the fixed assets
of the company should be revalued instead of just being indexed (see para. 4.01); 3) they
were unsure about the value assigned to the shares that ESM had received in payments
for certain bills (see para. 4.06 ); and 4) there were some intracompany transactions that
needed clarification. These issues were discussed with ESM which agreed to deal with
items 1 and 4 in the next six months. Item 7 will require an appraisal of fixed assets. Item
3 cannot easily be resolved since there is only a limited market for the shares. However,
any increase in the share amount would be limited by covenants proposed by the Bank
(see para 4.07 ) and should not alone result in the accountants being unwilling to express
an opinion. Agreement was therefore reached that ESM will have its fixed assets revalued
and will work with the international accountants to the extent required so that they can
express an opinion on the 1998financial statements.
4.11   Financial Operations The financial and accounting operations of the company
were reviewed both with ESM and with its international auditors. The accounting and
financial systems used by ESM are in relatively good shape since a substantial amount



27
was spent for hardware, software and technical assistance under the previous EBRD Loan
to ESM. As a result, ESM believes it now has the most advanced management
information systems in the country. These systems cover 38 separate units almost all of
whom have their own hardware and standard software. Coordination between the units
and headquarters, however, could still be firther improved though it has been improving
over the last several years and is expected to continue to improve. ( Most of the units used
to be self- managed under the old Yugoslav self-management system, but have been
steadily integrated into a single company.)
4.12   The finance and accounting area is headed by an Assistant General Manager
Finance and Accounting who reports directly to the General Manager of ESM - the chief
executive officer of the company. The Assistant General Manager has three " service
units" reporting directly to her, each headed by a Department Director. These three
service units are: finance, accounting, and planning and analysis (budgeting and
forecasting). In addition each of the separate "operating" units has a director of finance
and accounting who reports directly to the head of his/her unit but has a dotted line
relationship to the Assistant General Manager Finance and Accounting at headquarters.
There is also an internal audit department which reports directly to the General Manager.
4.13   The company prepares two complete financial reports in a year, at six months and
at the end of the year. There are, however, also monthly financial reports with
information on sales, costs, prices, receivables etc. Budgets are prepared once a year and
updated if necessary. Performance is measured against budget on a monthly basis, though
the units are not profits centers.
4.14    Spendable funds are mainly controlled by headquarters since funds are
transferred daily to headquarters from the collection accounts at the distribution units. In
addition most of the purchasing is done at headquarters by the Commercial Department,
which is responsible for procurement. The "operating" units have checking accounts on
which they can only write small checks. Moreover, any expenditure over 5000 DEM
requires the approval of the General Manager.
B. FINANCIAL FORECASTS
4.15   Table 4.2 below provides a forecast of ESM's operating revenues, operating
costs and operating income for the period 1996-2001. The 1996 figures are the audited
actual figures. The forecast figures assume a stable macro-economic situation in the
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with 3% inflation and a stable exchange rate (55
Denars/dollar) and these assumptions are similar to those used in preparing the most
recent economic forecast for the country. The average electricity price is 7.5 Pfennigs at
the assumed exchange rate, starting in mid 1999.

Operations
4.16   The above forecast, which is similar to ESM's internal forecast, shows that ESM
is expected to have substantial operating profits throughout the forecast time period at the
agreed average price level. Furthermore, cash flow from operations (defined as operating
profits plus depreciation but excluding changes in working capital etc.) will be excellent
because of the good operating profits and the excellent depreciation. The financial
situation of the company will, however, depend largely on the level of accounts
receivable and the level of capital investments. As was pointed out in para. 4.07, it is
expected that agreement will be reached to gradually reduce the level of accounts
receivable. If this occurs the company's financial situation will further improve
substantially. The main capital requirements of the company over the next five years are
those for the rehabilitation of the hydropower plants, rehabilitation of the distribution
system and on going investments in generation and transmission. The high level of
expected cash flow from operations, including the liquidation of receivables, should be
adequate so that the company can finance most of this needed capital investments and
cover its debt service. The company is, however, currently constructing the Kozjak dam
and hydropower plant at the request of the Government and the Government could want
it to undertake other multi-purpose hydropower projects or other large projects. This



29
could constrain its ability to finance the current project. Therefore, agreement was
reached that ESM will not undertake large, new investments prior to the commissioning
of the Kozjak Dam and Powerhouse unless it can provide evidence satisfactory to the
Bank that it would continue to meet the financial ratios specifed in para 4.08 after
undertaking such expenditures. Table 4.3 below provides a summary statement of cash
flows.

5. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS
5.01  The project has a number of benefits, largely from decreasing the costs of
operation and increasing reliability and safety with relatively low risks. The discussion of
benefits below is broken down into the three components. However, the components are
interrelated in that, for example, the improved energy management system (EMS) will
allow ESM to make better use of the increased hydropower capacity and production and
vice versa. Thus system improvement may be greater than the sum of the parts.
5.02 In general this analysis is carried out using international market-based prices and
costs. Taxes are excluded. Shadow prices could have been used for labor costs (see para.
5.14) but were not since they are not available. A sensitivity analysis assuming a lower
real cost for labor was carried out (see para. 5.16). The analysis excludes the Swiss grant
of 5 mil SF which was subject to a separate analysis conducted for the Government of
Switzerland by EEF.
A. HYDROPOWER PLANT REHABILITATION
5.03 The hydropower plants according to EEF are facing "equipment dilapidation" due
to age as well as obsolescence. As a result their generation, capacity , reliability and
safety are decreasing. Rehabilitation of these hydro-power plants is the least cost means
of providing the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with peaking capacity.
Furthermore, as these plants continue to deteriorate from age they will become rapidly
more unreliable depriving the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of its required
peaking capacity and leading to expensive outages. The only near term alternative, new
gas fired peaking units, would be much more expensive and increase the country's
already high reliance on imported energy. In emergencies power can sometimes be
obtained from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's neighbors. However, this
power cannot be relied on since many of the neighboring power systems have serious
problems and political relationships in the Balkans are uncertain.
5.04 The main benefits from rehabilitation of the hydropower plants are thus: 1)
increased hydropower generating capacity leading to improved primary and secondary
regulation; 2) increased hydropower generation; 3) reduction in hydropower plant
operating costs; and 4) reduced likelihood of hydropower plant and system outages.
5.05  Increased Capaciy. The reconstruction of the turbines at the hydropower plants
will add significantly to the generating capacity of these plants by increasing the
efficiency with which the water from the penstocks is used. This additional capacity will
add to system reserves and improve primary and secondary regulation. There are two
estimates of the increase in capacity. ESM has estimated that the total capacity increase
will be about 40 MW while the consultant, EEF, has estimated that the total increase in
capacity will be 31 MW. ESM and EEF use different assumptions but the assumptions
used by EEF are more conservative. In order to be conservative, for the purpose of this
analysis an increase of 31 MW has been used. If this capacity were to be built on a



31
greenfield basis it would probably cost around $1580/Kw, based on the average cost per
Kw of 16 proposed new hydropower plants in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia. (See The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Energy Review, Report
15313-Mk, Appendix B.) This would imply a replacement value of this additional
capacity of about $49 million. However, in market economies this system reserve
capacity can often be contracted from other power systems. The Macedonians have not
contracted reserve capacity but from previous work done on the adjacent Bulgarian
Electricity System, (See Staff Appraisal Report Bulgaria Energy Project, Report 11250-
BUL, page 38), it is estimated that this reserve capacity can be contracted for about
$100,000/MW/year. If this price is used for the additional Macedonian capacity it gives
it a value of $3.1 Million per year.
5.06 Increased Generafion. The increase in hydropower generation due to increased
efficiency of the turbines is estimated by EEF 13.7 Gwh per year. This is a gain of 1.9%
on average for the six plants and assumes an average year with 730 Gwh of hydropower
generation from these plants. Again this is a conservative assumption, since this 1.9%
gain in efficiency would have led to a 24.4 Gwh increase in generation last year and 16.3
Gwh increase in generation using the average of the past three years. This additional
power would be largely peaking power and generated in the winter when the demand for
power in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is at its peak due to the heating
load. It would replace either power generated from thermal power plants in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or power swaps with neighbors. This additional power
has been valued at 5 US cents/Kwh which is both a measure of consumers willingness to
pay (See para. 2.17.) and in the range of estimates of Long Run Marginal Cost. (See The
Forrmer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Energy Review, para. 5.21.) Thus the value of
this additional power, without any addition for consumer's surplus, would be $ 685,000
per year.
5.07  O    iig Cot. The investments in the hydropower plants will significantly
reduce operating costs, mainly repair costs, by replacing worn out or obsolete equipment.
Current equipment is expensive to maintain with the cost of repairs (mostly spare parts)
amounting to about $ 2 million per year. EEF has estimated that with the rehabilitation of
the plants the cost of repairs could be reduced to about $ 1 million per year for a net gain
of $ 1.0 million per year. It is assumed that this would continue for 10 years and then that
repair costs would again start to rise, reaching their current level in 20 years.
5.08  Outags. Because of the age of the equipment, outages of hydropower generating
units are expected to increase rapidly unless these units are rehabilitated. As a first
approximation, EEF assumed that one power plant out of six would be out of operation
one month per year if no rehabilitation were undertaken and that this risk would be
reduced by two thirds if the plants were rehabilitated. This implies that as a result of the
rehabilitation the lost generation from outages of hydropower plants would be reduced by
about 7 Gwh per year. If in fact this electricity was unserved energy (i.e. it resulted in
brown outs or black outs) the value would be very high. Typical values for unserved
energy, used in planning studies in the US are in the range of $1.00 to $4.00 per Kwh.



32
($1000-$4000/Mwh) and in planning studies in Bulgaria values of 30 US cents/Kwh or
more are used. However, we have valued this electricity at 5 US cents/Kwh as explained
above which gives this benefit a value of $350,000 per year. This assumes that the
electricity would have been replaced by electricity generated from thermal power plants
or by swaps with neighboring countries.
5.09  Total benefits, Total estimated benefits thus are about $5.13 million per year,
using quite conservative assumptions. The Economic Rate of Return ( ERR) on this
component would then be about 17%. Including the 18% contingencies in the capital
costs reduces the ERR to 14%. If less conservative assumptions are used, for example
assuming the outages described in para 5.08 above would lead to unserved energy valued
at $500/Mwh ( see para 5.13), then the ERR would be over 30%. The base case of
estimate of 17%, however, appears to be a reasonable.
B. COMPLETION OF ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
5.10 The Energy Management System ( EMS) will increase efficiency, reliability and
security of supply in the power system. There are no good alternatives, and without the
EMS the power system would have higher operating and maintenance costs and need a
higher reserve margin to minimize loss of load probability.
5.11 The quantifiable benefits of a modern Energy Management System (EMS) are
derived from four main areas: (i) generation scheduling benefits; (ii) benefits from
improved system reliability and security; (iii) operation and maintenance cost savings;
and (iv) benefits from sharing of common spinning reserves in a large interconnected
power system, such as that of Western European Power Interconnected System (UCPTE).
The extent of these benefits depends on the structure and size of the power system.
5.12  Generation Scheduling Benefits.  The benefits arise from on-line economic
dispatch, both of units under real-time control as well as those that are controlled
manually, and economic dispatch of spinning reserve. The main benefit is fuel savings.
Large utilities with significant variations in fuel costs have claimed savings of 1% to 4%
of total annual fuel cost. For ESM, the generation component of the electric system is
dominated by the three units (3x 225 MW) of the Bitola lignite-fired power plant. On
any given operating day, the Bitola units may account for more than 75% of the power
output. As a result, ESM does not stand to gain as much from the opportunity for
exploiting diversification of generating resources, as larger electric utilities can gain from
Economic Dispatch and Unit Commitment programs. However, the opportunity does
exist to receive some benefit from hydro-thermal scheduling (including Unit
Commitment), optimal power flow, loss minimalization, and on-line Economic Dispatch.
For the ESM system, estimated savings are expected to be about 1% of total annual fuel
cost or $ 365,000 per year.



33
5.13 Benefits from Improved Reliability of Operations. Utilities generally have
reported gains in overall system reliability resulting from the implementation of an EMS.
Benefits arise from a decrease in outages due to an increase in overall security of
electricity supply. This in turn results from improved control over power flow through the
transmission network, and faster response and restoration after a black-out. In addition to
the revenue gains from fewer outages there are social benefits reflecting the indirect cost
to the economy of power outages. The Bank's consultant on this component as well as
ESM have estimated that an improvement in reliability of 0.025%, or 2.2 hours per year,
can be achieved by installing an EMS. In putting a value on this reduction in potential
system outages, it is assumed that these potential system outages would occur during the
winter since this is when the system is under greatest pressure due to the heating load .In
the winter a potential outage of 2.2 hours would imply a potential loss in consumption of
about 2.2 million Kwh. As pointed out above, estimates in the US of the costs of
unserved energy are high but given the lower levels of income and GNP in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a lower value for unserved energy should apply.
Therefore for the purposes of this analysis a value of 50 US cents/Kwh ($500/Mwh) was
used. ( It should be noted, however, that an analysis made for the earlier EMS Project for
the Yugoslav Federation indicated a much higher value- $2000/Mwh for unserved
energy. However, this was an estimate for all of Yugoslavia, not the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia which was one of the poorer parts, and the estimate was made in
much better economic circumstances) This value of $500/Mwh for unserved energy
implies in turn that the reduction in potential system outages resulting from the EMS
would be worth about $ 1.1 Million per year.
5.14  Benefits from Qperation and Maintenanc *       . ESM can gain greatly
from the efficiencies that an Energy Management System offers, particularly in
substation operations. In the United Sates, many substations are "operator-less" and
"crew-less" and are served by mobile crews. ESM has calculated a personnel benefit
based on the reduction of substation staffing from 170 to 70 staff. Similar benefits could
be realized from reduction in power plant operating staff. This implies that ESM's staff
could be reduced by about 200 persons as a result of the EMS. Given that the typical
employee costs ESM $6700 per year this implies a potential savings of about $1.34
Million per year. (This estimate of $6700 per worker is the financial savings for ESM; the
economic benefit to the country from redeploying workers over time may be less though
how much less is not clear.) These savings are unlikely to be implemented immediately
and but still they could be implemented over a few year through a reduction in new hires.
5.15  Other Benefit. These are savings that would arise from the connection of the
Macedonian network to the UCPTE network and the sharing of common spinning
reserves which would reduce the requirement for ESM to have independent spinning
reserves. A good EMS would significantly improve the ability of ESM to reconnect to
UCPTE. Estimates of these benefits are currently not included in the project benefits, due
to the current uncertainty about the timing of the reconnection to the UCPTE system.
(See para. 2.13.)



34
5.16 Total Benefits. The total benefits from the Energy Management System (EMS)
are about $2.8 Million per year when the system is fully operating and the number of
personnel have been reduced. Total base case costs of completion are $ 8.7 Million.
Taking into account that the attrition in personnel will likely be slow, the ERR on this
component would be about 30% using base costs. Including contingencies in capital costs
decreases the rate of return to 25%. If it were assumed that the economic benefit from
reducing the work force at ESM and employing new workers elsewhere is only one half
the financial benefit (i.e. $3350 per person instead of $6700) and using capital cost
including contingencies, then the ERR would be reduced to 19 % - still a very good real
rate of return.
C. DISTRIBUTION CPONENT
5.17 This is the smallest component and would just begin the rehabilitation of the
distribution system. It is estimated that the new transformers might reduce losses by
about 0.5% of sales. This would amount to 25 Gwh per year. Assuming again that the
value of this electricity is 5 US cents/Kwh, this implies a value of the saved electricity of
about 1.25 million dollars per year. The real economic rate of return on this component
would be quite high at 26% using base costs and 22% including contingencies.
D. TOTAL PROJECT BENEFITS
5.18 The real ERR for the project as a whole is 21% making conservative assumptions
and taking as total capital costs, base capital costs. Including 18% contingencies in
capital costs reduces the ERR to 17%. In both case the ERR is quite good since this is a
rehabilitation/completion project with high benefits attributable to relatively moderate
investments.
E. PROJECT RISKS
5.19  The risks in the project are quite low, though there is a possibility of
implementation delays since the Macedonians have little experience with Bank
procurement procedures. The delays, however, would not necessarily have a major
impact on the ERR since both outlays and benefits would be delayed. Moreover, the
process of hiring consultants to assist with engineering/procurement began before the
project was appraised and consultants for both the hydropower rehabilitation and EMS
Components should be in place prior to Loan effectiveness. This should greatly speed up
procurement and offset the Macedonians lack of experience with Bank procedures.
5.20 There is a risk that ESM may not be able to generate sufficient local counterpart
funds for the project due to inadequacy of tariff levels or over-spending on other projects.
This tariff risk is mitigated by the requirement that the Government maintain adequate
tariff levels and by the Government's past practices in this regard. Furthermore, the



35
company's financial health should be maintained by the various financial covenants
which it is required to meet. Other risks by components are discussed below.
5.21  Hydropower Plant Rehabilitation. Procurement on this component is somewhat
more difficult since it is mainly replacement equipment and there are a limited number of
suppliers. However, there appear to be sufficient suppliers that ICB can be used.
Furthermore, as was pointed out above, consultants will be hired to insure that
procurement is done as fast as feasible following Bank Guidelines. Costs could be higher
than anticipated, but this seems unlikely given that EFF's overall cost estimates are
similar to those produced by ESM. A continuing period of very dry weather would have
a negative impact on project performance since there would be less water available to
generate power even if the power were generated more efficiently. However, the
calculations of the ERR were based on recent Macedonian experience which has been
one of relative dryness.
5.22 EMS Cgmponent. Due to the high technology nature of the project, there are
risks associated with the fact this technology is continuously evolving and changing
rapidly. There is, therefore a risk that the staff involved in project implementation may
lack certain necessary skills at key dates. The participation of qualified consultants and
carefully scheduled training tied to the key supply contracts should minimize the risk.
5.23  Distribution. The risks in the distribution component are quite small and it
appears to be attractive as a small separate component. However, the full impact of this
component would occur only if ESM rehabilitates the entire distribution system. ESM
will need outside funding for such a major distribution project and has discussed with the
Bank the possibility of funding such a future project.
F. PROIECT SUSIAIABILITY
5.24   The project is entirely sustainable as long as the equipment is properly
maintained and the needed repairs and updating are carried out. This is in turn likely to
depend largely on the level of electricity prices. If prices are maintained at an adequate
level ESM has both the funds and the incentive to repair and update the equipment.
However, if electricity prices were to decline to the point that they only covered cash
costs or below then ESM would cut back on maintenance and the equipment would
deteriorate. It is in the interest of the Government and ESM to maintain an adequate level
of electricity prices and this is reinforced by the Bank's covenants. With adequate upkeep
the hydroelectric plants can then produce electricity almost indefinitely since their fuel
(water) is renewable.

6. AGREEMENTS REACHED
6.01  The following conditions have been fulfilled:
(a) ESM has selected the consultants to assist with the implementation of the
hydropower plant rehabilitation component (para 3.17);
(b) ESM has issued requests for proposals to an agreed short list of consultants
for assistance with the Energy Management System (para 3.17).
6.02 The following are legal covenants agreed with the Government:
(a) adopt regulations under the Energy Law acceptable to the Bank governing the
operations of IPPs by December 31, 1998 (para. 1.10).
(b) within one year of the first disbursement under the Loan, set electricity prices
in accordance with a methodology pursuant to the provisions of the Energy Law which
shall result in an average price of not less than 7.5 Pfennigs/Kwh or the price required to
meet the financial covenants specified below in Para. 6.4 (h), whichever is higher.
6.03 The following are legal covenants agreed with the Government and ESM:
(a) preparation of a least cost electricity supply plan by December 31, 1999 (para.
4.05);
6.04 The following are legal covenants agreed with ESM:
(a) maintain the project management unit as established until the end of the
project (para. 3.18);
(b) have the Project Account and the Special Account audited and submitted to
the Bank six months after the end of each year ( para 3.14);
(c) submit audited financial statements six months after the end of each year (para.
3.14);
(d) undertake and complete by December 31, 1998 any further strengthening of
Mavrovo Dam which the agreed analysis shows is needed (para 3.17);
(e) maintain, have inspected and ensure the safety of the 4 dams involved in the
Project (para. 3.17);
(f) reduce the ratio of its accounts receivable to revenues from sales each year so
that it attains by December 31, 2002 a target level of 18% of annual revenues (para 4.07);



37
(g) payments to ESM for electricity in the form of shares should be limited to no
more than 5% of ESM's revenues from sales (para 4.07);
(h) achieve certain standard financial ratios starting in 1998. These ratios are: 1)
generation of funds from internal sources should be at least 30% of investments; 2) funds
generated from operations (net revenues) should be at least 150% of debt service; and 3)
the current ratio must be no less than 1.2. (para. 4.08);
(i) have its fixed assets revalued and work with the international accountants to
the extent required so that they can express an opinion on its 1998 financial statements
(para.4.10); and
0)  not undertake the construction of any large new projects prior to the
commissioning of the Kozjak Dam and Powerhouse unless it can provide evidence
satisfactory to the Bank that it would continue to meet the financial ratios specified
above, after having undertaken such expenditure (para. 4.16).

Dam Safr
Recommendations
This Annex summarizes the recommendations made by the dam safety consultants which
could further enhance safety. (This is in addition to the safety investments required to
reduce the phreatic line in the downstream shell at Mavrovo). All the cost figures cover
only the foreign currency component. Local currency costs would add the equivalent of
about $60,000 to the total.
1.0   Review of Macedonian Dam Safety Regulations. This recommendation is based
on the English translation of 17 Macedonian articles related to dam safety and
discussions with dam owners. It would appear from this information that Dam
Safety Regulations should be reviewed to see if they may need to be strengthened.
It is therefore recommended to prepare a good English translation of all dam-
safety related documents, and to have these reviewed by an international expert
who would discuss requirements with the dam owners ( mostly, but not entirely
ESM).
Foreign currency component: costs for a review of revised regulations by an
international expert or a review panel, e.g ...........................   $ 20,000
2.0   Software for automated data plotting of monitoring results. Data of hundreds
of instrument records are plotted in a cumbersome way by hand. This archaic way
is not only time consuming but also slow with respect to obtaining information
about unusual or changed conditions. The monitoring team is aware of the
problem and is gradually improving the situation. It is, however, recommended to
shortcut this process and acquire one of the numerous excellent software packages
which were developed for other dams.
Foreign currency component: costs for acquiring a dam-specific data processing
and plotting program including tramining ...........................$ 10,000
3.0   Training. Local budgets do not provide expenditures for professional training
such as overseas study tours, participation on international dam safety conferences
or the like. Moreover, there does not exist any means to acquire technical
literature. It is recommended that funding be provided for periodic study tours to
visit dams, meet leading personnel of dam safety institutions and attend



Annex 3-2
Page 2 of 4
conferences on dam safety. It is also recommended to establish something like a
"dam safety library" stacked with technical literature (books, proceedings from
conferences, subscription of "Hydropower & Dams" etc.)
Foreign currency component:
(a) Overseas study tour: 4 participants, duration: 2 weeks, including: air travel,
local travel and   accommodation, accompanied by local staff in the foreign
country, participation at a   conference, costs per
tour ................             $ 50,000
(b) Dam safety library   .... $ 12,000
4.0   Inspection of morning glory spillway tunnels. The transition section from shaft
to tunnel in the morning glory spillways is prone to cavitation damage. This is
particularly so if the concrete quality is poor, as in the case of Tikves dam. It is
recommended to inspect the spillway tunnels after each spilling in excess of 10%
of the spillway capacity.
5.0   Replacement of failed pressure cells by conventional standpipes. In the 4 dams
184 out of 265 electrical pressure cells (pore and total pressure) are out of order or
render unreliable results. Some of these instruments are dispensable, others are
not. It is recommended to replace those pore pressure cells in the core of Spilje
and Tikves dams, which are necessary to evaluate reliable pressure gradients by
new electrical cells or standpipes. In the case of Mavrovo dam, a review of the
downstream pore pressure pattern should support the decision which failed
piezometers, if any, should be replaced. The cost estimate below assumes the
replacement of 50 electrical piezometer cells. Drilling and other civil works is
assumed to be covered by local contractors and is therefore not considered in the
foreign currency component.
Foreign currency component: 75 electrical piezometers to be installed by
technician of the supplier ....                      $ 70,000
6.0   Upgrading of part of the existing instruments. It is recommended to create a
reserve fund for replacement and upgrading of instruments which are already, or
will become obsolete in the near future. This mainly refers to contact gauges to
measure piezometric levels and to leakage measurement.

Foreign currency component:
(a) 4 contact gauges with accessories ................................ $ 8,000
(b) Contingency for yet unallocated replacements ............................. $ 10,000
7.0   Automated control for leakage at Spilje and Tikves dams. Leakage at these
two dams is high and at Spilje dam it has an increasing tendency. Moreover,
sudden changes in seepage flow are possible due to the karstic geology at Spilje
dam and due to a partly permeable grout curtain at Tikves dam. It is therefore
recommended to install an automated control to record leakage for these two
dams.
Foreign currency component:
Two level meters (submergible probe) and remote control recording systems
(chart recorder) to be installed in the control room of the power houses at Spilje
and Tikves dams .........                                 $ 62,500
8.0   "No overtopping" analysis for Spilje dam. The arrangement for gate operation
of the bottom outlets is unique. Can the spillway design flood be discharged by
the spillway alone (bottom outlet inoperable) without causing overtopping? An
analysis should investigate this exceptional scenario.
............................................................................ $20,000
9.0    Review of SDF for Tikves dam. The spillway design flood for Tikves dam is
based on a hydrological recording period 1935-1963/65. It is recommended to
review the SDF based on updated hydrological
records ......                  $20,000
10    FiniteElement-analysis for earthquake loading. A FE-analysis for those dams
is recommended which were analyzed only pseudo-
dynamically ......     $20,000

PROMCT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
1.    The project will be implemented by ESM with technical assistance from outside
consultants. Two groups of outside consultants will be used, one for technical assistance
with the rehabilitation of the hydropower plants and the second for technical assistance
with the completion of the Energy Management System ( EMS). No technical assistance
is required for the small distribution component. Both groups of consultants will assist
ESM with preparing specifications, helping produce the procurement packages and
assisting with designing an implementation schedule. The implementation schedule is
somewhat complex since it has to take into account the likely timing of the availability of
replacement parts and new equipment, the time required to install them and the need for
having the various units available in order to meet the daily and seasonal changes in
electricity demand. Bidding packages including terms of reference and short lists have
been prepared for both groups of consultants. The hydropower rehabilitation consultants
will be hired before the project goes to the Board and there is a significant probability that
the EMS consultants will be hired by that time also though it is not a requirement of the
Loan Agreement.
2.    ESM has established a project implementation unit. It is headed by the head of
ESM's projects department and has the following structure.
Project Manager-   Head of Projects Department

3.    In Annex 3-1 are tables which show the projected timetable for various packages.
However, these dates must be considered quite tentative since, as is indicated in the first
paragraph, one of the major tasks of the consultants will be to prepare implementation
schedules taking a number of technical factors into account (need for plants, time
required for rehabilitation, water flows, availability of skilled workers, manufacturing
time for equipment etc.). These implementation schedules once prepared should be more
accurate and the current schedules are considered quite tentative.
