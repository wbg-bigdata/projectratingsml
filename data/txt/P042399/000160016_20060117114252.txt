3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry

3.1 Original Objective:
The objectives of the project were to: 1) increase efficiency of hydropower generation; 2) expand the
generating capacity of the major hydropower plants; 3) increase system operating efficiency of the power
generation and transmission facilities; 4) reduce losses in the electricity distribution system; 5) facilitate
the development of an independent power plant industry; and 6) facilitate the re-integration of the Borrower
into UCPTE.

3.2 Revised Objective:
No revisions

3.3 Original Components:
Hydropower Plants. The major component was the rehabilitation of the six major hydropower plants in
Macedonia through the provision of equipment and technical assistance and the carrying out of works.
These plants are Globocica, Spilje, Tikves, and the three plants in the Mavrovo Cascade (Vrutok, Raven,
Vrben). They represent about 28% of Macedonia's generating capacity and 92% of its hydropower
capacity. In addition this component involved some work on dam safety since questions were raised about
the safety of Mavrovo dam. This turned out not to be justified since the concerns were based on faulty
readings by a defective instrument. This component is rated highly satisfactory since the rehabilitation of
the plants produced substantially more generating capacity and a greater increase in operating efficiency
than was anticipated in the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR).

Enery Management System. This component had three sub-components all related to providing the
dispatch center and management with better information and control over the system. These three
sub-components were: 1) modernization of the SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) system
which consisted primarily of the supply and installation of new remote control units (RTUs), 2) completion
of the dispatch center, hardware and software which was begun under an earlier Bank Project for the
Yugoslav Federation, 3) improvement in ESM's telecommunication facilities. This component is rated
satisfactory since all three sub-components are in operation and working as anticipated.

Distribution System. This component was designed to begin the rehabilitation of the Macedonian
Distribution System. The cost estimates for complete rehabilitation were around $60 million so this
component ($5 million) was very small considering the needs. However, it was focused on those
distribution sub-stations in the worst condition. Given the limits on Macedonia's borrowing capacity
additional funding was not available at the time the project was prepared. This component is rated
satisfactory since the additional investment helped reduce losses in the distribution system although far
larger investments were and are needed.

Dam Safety. This was an extremely small component to improve the operations of the dam safety unit in
ESM. It consisted of funds for: 1) safety regulations review; 2) overseas training; 3) various safety studies;
4) monitoring instruments; and 5) publications for the library. Originally this component had an allocation
of funds ($650,000) to strengthen the Mavrovo Dam but this turned out to be unnecessary since the
problem identified turned out to be a faulty piezometer not the dam itself.

The results by component are somewhat different than anticipated. The hydropower component cost more
than expected largely due to the strength in the European currencies where most of the equipment came
from. Other components were less than anticipated due to: 1) the better than anticipated prices obtained on
the Energy Management System (EMS) equipment and software; 2) fewer distribution transformers
acquired than anticipated due to a procurement dispute; 3) the lack of a requirement to carry out civil
works on the Mavrovo dam as mentioned above.

CURRENCY It should be noted that the above table above is in dollars which was the unit used in the
SAR. However, the actual loan was not in dollars but in Deutch Marks (61.5 Million DEM). This loan was
then converted into Euro 31,444,450.69. The costs of the project were calculated in DEM or Euro at the
time incurred (with varying Dollar/DEM and Dollar/Euro exchange rates) and the actual cost numbers
above are the Euro costs (and the DEM costs converted to Euro) converted to dollars at the current
exchange rate of about 1.25 dollars per Euro. Thus it is somewhat difficult to compare planned numbers
with actual because of currency fluctuations.

4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs

4.1 Outcome/achievement of objective:
The outcome of the project is rated as fully satisfactory (if not highly satisfactory). The project was
completed on time (there was no extension) in spite of very severe social problems in the area in which
most of the hydropower plants are located due to an influx of Kosavar refugees followed by civil
disturbances (See section 5.1) Also the project objectives were all achieved or over achieved - see below.

The physical major objectives of increasing the capacity and generation of the hydropower plants and
reducing their operating costs were over achieved with more capacity and generation achieved than forecast
(see below). The EMS/SCADA system was installed at less than the estimated cost and is working well and
reducing system operating cost. The distribution component has been successful as well as the dam safety
component. Also ESM is once again an active member of UCTE and they could not have participated in
UCTE without the Automatic Generation Controls which were installed as part of the project. The final
component was to "facilitate the development of independent power producers with the initial plants
probably being mini-hydropower plants." This component has been achieved. Five new non-governmental
mini-hydropower plants have been built, seven mini-hydropower plants are being rehabilitated and operated
by the private sector under a ROT contract. Also there is a proposal from a Slovene firm to build 20
additional mini-hydropower plants although the Bank is requesting open tendering for this proposal. A
large, 200 MW gas fired, combined cycle, CHP power plant has been agreed for Skopje in principle. It is


                                                    - 3 -

expected to be built by a private group consisting of a private Russian gas producer and the privately
owned Skopje District Heating System.

4.2 Outputs by components:
Hydropower plants: The objective was to increase the capacity of the 6 hydropower plants by 31 Mw. In
fact the capacity of the plants was increased by 49.2 Mw, about 59% more than projected. The objective
was also to increase the potential output from the power plants under normal hydropower conditions by 13
MWh per year. In fact the increase in potential output is 40.9 GWh, slightly over 3 times the target level.
The increase in potential output comes not only from the higher capacity but also from more efficient
turbines which extract more energy from the water flow. In other words the rehabilitated plants extract
more power per cubic meter of water flow than did the unrehabilitated plants.

ESM implemented the hydropower rehabilitation using a method which placed a greater burden on plant
management and the PIU. Usually, in order to reduce risk, one contractor is given overall responsibility for
rehabilitating an entire power plant. The contractor takes total responsibility and usually charges
significantly for undertaking this risk. However, this project was implemented by having 5 packages
awarded to different contractors with each package covering specific equipment which was to be
rehabilitated in all plants. The specific packages were: 1) turbines and turbine generators; 2) valves and
cooling systems; 3) generators, static excitation systems and voltage regulators; 4) controls systems and
AC/DC; 5) switch yards and switch gear. ESM made sure that these packages were coordinated both in
terms of timing and in terms of making sure that all of the new equipment worked with the other new
equipment and old equipment. By reducing contractors risk substantially this reduced costs for the project.

Energy Management System: This objective was completed satisfactorily. The new remote terminal units
were installed which improved the SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) System. The
software and hardware in the dispatch center (purchased under an earlier Bank project for Yugoslavia) was
upgraded and improved. ESM's telecommunications system was greatly improved by installing fiber optic
wire between power stations and the dispatch center in Skopje. This fiber optic wire could also be used to
carry non-ESM communications if so desired.

Distribution: This component is small and only started the rehabilitation of the Macedonian Distribution
System. It was completed satisfactorily although its impact on the overall distribution system was of
necessity small as well.

Dam Safety:       This component consisted of training, software, replacement of piezometers, new
instruments, purchase of books etc. It has resulted in a much strengthened dam safety group in ESM, which
is the only dam safety group in Macedonia. There was originally some concern that the phreatic line in the
downstream shell of the Mavrovo dam was high and funds were put in the loan for strengthening this shell.
However, this turned out not to be the case and the high phreatic line was caused by piezometers which
were not functioning properly.

4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
Hydropower Plant Rehabilitation
The benefit from the increased capacity resulting from the rehabilitation of the hydropower plants was
estimated in the SAR as the 31Mw of additional capacity times an estimated contract value for capacity
from outside Macedonia of $100,000/Mw/year for a total benefit of $ 3.1 Million per year. The actual
additional capacity is 49.2 Mw and ESM reports that neighboring countries are charging it 1750
Euros/Mw (or about $2200/Mw) for standby capacity for 48 hours. (Since this is expensive ESM tries not
to use this facility). This would amount to $ 401,000/Mw/year for stand by capacity. Since Macedonia



                                                     - 4 -

does not need standby capacity for much of the year it was decided to use a value for stand by capacity of
$220,000/Mw/year. Thus the total benefit would now be estimated at $10.8 Million per year.

The benefit from increased generation was estimated in the SAR at 13.7 GWh per year additional
generation times 5 US cents/kWh Long Run Marginal Cost (LRMC) for a total benefit of $685,000 per
year. The current estimate of additional generation is 40.9 GWh. If we assume the LRMC is currently
about the same, which it seems to be, this benefit would be worth $ 2.0 Million per year. An alternative is
to value this benefit at the current cost of imports of about 3.7 Euro cents or 4.6 US cents/kWh. This
would produce a benefit of $ 1.88 Million per year. Both of these measures of value exclude any consumers
surplus.

Rehabilitation of the hydropower plants has substantially reduced operating costs of these plants. The SAR
estimated the rehabilitation of the hydropower plants would reduce repair costs by 50% from about $2
Million per year to about $1 Million per year for 10 years with repair costs starting to rise after that and
ending at the then current level of about $2 Million per year after 20 years. The only plant which has been
rehabilitated and operating long enough to provide information on the reduction in repairs is Globocica,
which has two generating units. For that plant the down time due to required repairs has been reduced from
an average of 75 hours per year for each generating unit before rehabilitation to an average of 28 hours per
unit after rehabilitation (2 unit average for 2004). Thus repair costs measured in terms of hours have been
reduced by 62%. If this 62% reduction is applied to the estimated repair costs of $ 2.8 Million (excluding
salaries which are essentially a fixed cost) then the reduction in costs would be $1.74 Million per year.

The number of hours of operation of the plants has increased by 47 hours per year (75-28) due to less
down time for repairs. However, it is unlikely that this would lead to much additional electricity output
since the plants all are associated with reservoirs and when they are not operating the water is normally
saved. There could be a minor benefit in that with fewer repairs the plants might be better able to meet peak
demand, but this is likely to be small and was not taken into account.

A fourth benefit was calculated in the SAR from the rehabilitation of the hydropower plants. This is the
reduction in unplanned outages estimated at 7 GWhs and valued at 5 US cents/kWh for a total benefit of
$350,000 per year. No information is available on the reduction in unplanned outages after rehabilitation,
and although this reduction has clearly occurred, this benefit has not been included in the recalculation of
the ERR shown below.

In the SAR the estimated ERR for this, the major component, was 17% real. Based on the first three
benefits shown above and the costs of this component shown in the earlier table, the actual ERR on this
component is about 22% real , higher than originally estimated due to the higher capacity and greater
generation resulting from rehabilitation.

Energy Management System

The benefits from the Energy Management System were assumed to consist of: 1) generation scheduling
benefits; 2) benefits from operation and maintenance cost savings; 3) benefits from improved reliability of
operations; and     4) benefits from being able to participate in UCTE. The benefits from generation
scheduling were estimated at 1% of yearly fuel costs valued at that time as $365,000 per year. This 1% of
fuel costs ESM considers to be a reasonable estimate and it would be $754,000 currently. The benefits
from operation and maintenance cost savings were estimated in the SAR as reduction in staff of 200
persons with savings of $6700 per person for a total " benefit" of $1.34 Million. In fact the reduction in
staff appears to be 100 persons and the average cost of these staff ESM estimates at $3500 per year. The
low estimated cost of the staff is due to the fact that ESM does not generally fire staff but replaces retiring
staff with new entrants. Thus the $3500 per person is the cost of the new staff that ESM does not have to
hire. Therefore the total operations and maintenance cost savings "benefit" is about $350,000 per year. The
benefit from improved reliability of operations was estimated at 2.2 GWh of reduction in system outages
valued at the cost of unserved energy of $500/MWh. This gave a total value of this benefit of $1.1 Million
per year. The estimate reduction in outages of 2.2 GWh is probably OK but ESM believes that there would
be no unserved energy- rather they would obtain emergency power from Serbia costing about 55 Euro per
MWh. If this is the value of the reduction in outages then this benefit would be estimated at about $
150,000 per year. The last benefit, participating in UCTE, was not valued in the original report and still
cannot be easily valued. However, ESM pointed out that the improved EMS , especially automatic
generation control, was a major factor in allowing them to participate in UCTE. In 2000 ESM was able to
hold its actual generation within + or - 20 MW of its target generation only 34% of the time. After the
EMS system was fully operational in 2004 the company was maintaining its generation within this narrow
band 82% of the time.

While the actual benefits from the Energy Management System are less than anticipated, the cost of
this system was also less than forecast. As a result the ERR on this component actually was 28%
compared with the 30% ERR forecast.

Distribution

The SAR estimated that this component (consisting largely of new transformers) would reduce system
losses by 25 GWh per year which was valued at the LRMC of electricity of 5.0 US cents/kWh. This gave a
total benefit for this component of $ 1.25 million per year and an ERR of 21%. In fact this component was
smaller than anticipated but 9 new distribution transformers were installed. On average they reduced losses
by about 988 MWh per year according to ESM. For the total of the 9 transformers this amounts to 8.90
GWh per year which valued at an LRMC of 5 US cents/kWh is $ 445,000 per year. Considering the
smaller investment than anticipated ($3.8 Million instead of $5 Million) the rate of return on this
component is still a respectable 11%.

For the project as a whole the estimated ERR was 21%. The actual ERR was 22%.

Rehabilitation
Energy Management System               30%                 28%                         5.3
Distribution Rehabilitation            21%                 11%                         0.15
Project Total                          21%                 22%                         39.2

It should be noted that the total project included the dam safety and PIU components, for which no benefits
could be readily calculated although there were clearly significant benefits. However, the costs of the dam
safety and the PIU components were included in total project costs. The result of this inclusion is that, the
NPV of the total project benefits is less than the sum of the NPVs of the benefits from the three components
for which benefits have been calculated.

4.4 Financial rate of return:
No financial rate of return was calculated in the SAR. However, the actual financial rate of return (FRR)
would be the same as the ERR if additional electricity generation and savings for the hydropower and
distribution components were valued at 5 US cents per kWh , the LRMC. If they were valued at the cost of
emergency supplies from Serbia of 5.5 Euro Cents/kWh then the FRR would be 24% while if the electricity
was valued at the average import price currently of about 3.7 Euro cents per kWh (4.6 US cents) then the
FRR would be 21%.

4.5 Institutional development impact:
 The main institutional requirements under the loan were that the Government should: 1) adopt regulations
under the Energy Law acceptable to the Bank governing the operations of IPPs; and 2) set electricity prices
according to the methodology in the energy law so prices are higher than 7.5 Pfennigs (3.8 Euro cents).
Both of these requirements were met and there has been an expansion of IPPs. In addition to the five small
hydropower plants currently operating, another 20 have been discussed with the government (although the
Bank argues that the tariff for these plants is too high) and construction of a large 200 MW gas fired plant
in Skopje has been agreed with entirely private funding.

The project has also served to continue the Bank's dialogue with the Government on energy and electricity
issues. This dialogue has involved issues of industry restructuring, privatization, pricing and payments
discipline. The dialogue has contributed to a Government decision to break ESM into four separate
companies (generation, distribution, transmission and the Negotino power plant) and privatize some of
them. Of these companies, distribution (new ESM) and the Negotino Power Plant will be definitely
privatized while the transmission company (MEPSO) will not be privatized. Privatization of the generation
company (ELEM) has been put on hold pending resolution of the issues related to the large hydropower
plants. A regulatory agency (ERC) has been established to set electricity tariffs and remove them from the
political arena. Finally the Bank has pushed steadily on payments discipline in order to try to reduce losses
and insure that those customers who receive invoices pay these invoices. This part of the dialogue has been
a mixed success and payments discipline is still not as good as would be liked. However, part of the
problem is political and cannot be easily resolved at the company level. Privatization may help resolve this
issue if it is done correctly.

5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome

5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency:
The project was delayed by the influx of refugees into Macedonia from Kosovo in 2000. This was
destabilizing for the country but particularly destabilizing for the project because four of the six
hydropower plants are in the North Western part of the country where the influx occurred. The second
problem occurred in 2002 when there were civil disturbances in the country centering again in the North



                                                      - 7 -

Western part of the country. For some time it was not possible to get foreign engineers or consultants to
visit that part of the country. However, in spite of these problems, ESM continued to implement the project
with only limited delays which were then made up.

5.2 Factors generally subject to government control:
Through out the entire period of the project the Government controlled the average price of electricity. It
kept the price at or above the level it had agreed with the Bank of 7.5 Pfennigs, about 3.8 Euro Cents per
Kwh. Had the price been allowed to decline sharply ESM might not have had sufficient funds to provide
the required counterpart funding. However, the price did not decline.

The Government did require ESM to continue to supply electricity to certain large customers who did not
pay their bills on time if at all. Also ESM was required to supply some of these customers at low prices,
close to marginal costs. This led to ESM having a high level of receivables throughout the project
implementation period which reduced its cash flow. Also the low sales prices to certain customers reduced
profitability. However, in spite of these problems, ESM was able to provide most/all of the required
counter part funds although at times it was tight.

5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
Project implementation by ESM was excellent with a competent and well staffed PIU.

Distribution losses rose to a high level although they are now in the process of coming down. This was
partially ESM's fault in that they were not active enough in cutting off nonpaying customers when they
could.    However, in certain parts of the country , due to the civil disturbances and after effects,
disconnections were not feasible and so that the rise in distribution losses in these areas was not mostly
attributable to ESM (see 5.1 above).

5.4 Costs and financing:
The project ended up costing about $ 9 Million more than anticipated (see table 3.0) . Much of this
additional cost was local costs paid by ESM including taxes, local products and services. At one point it
appeared that the project was short about 5 Million Euro needed to pay for the goods and services
purchased overseas. However, this shortfall declined over time and was eventually about 2 Million Euro.
ESM paid this extra amount.




6. Sustainability

6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
The main component of this project is the rehabilitation of the six largest hydropower plants in Macedonia.
Hydropower plants are extremely long lived and have low operating and maintenance costs. With small
expenditures on operations and maintenance (less than 10% of the value of the electricity produced) these
plants should continue to operate for several more generations. One of the smaller plants that ESM
operates, Matka, has been in operation since the mid 1930s and still operates well although it is less
efficient than a modern plant. The recently rehabilitated plants may need rehabilitation/upgrading in
another 40 years or so, but the economics of doing so should be very favorable. If it is not done they could
probably continue to operate though, not as well.

The other components, EMS and distribution transformers, are not as long lived. Because of the continuing
rapid advances in information technology, the EMS may need upgrading in another 10 years. However, this
should be low cost with a high rate of return. If the upgrading is not done it is likely that the older system



                                                      - 8 -

would continue to work it would just be outdated and inefficient. The distribution transformers will also
need to be replaced in perhaps 10-20 years as electricity demand grows and larger and newer transformers
are required. Again this should be economic since losses may be rising again by that time as the
transformers become over loaded.

6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
No transition arrangements are needed. The plants are back in regular operation.

7. Bank and Borrower Performance

Bank
7.1 Lending:
The process of preparing the project and taking it to the Board was done smoothly and with no significant
problems. There were some spirited discussion at negotiations about the financial covenants for ESM but
an agreement was reached which satisfied both sides.

7.2 Supervision:
Regular supervision was undertaken with missions about twice a year. Doing most of this period the
supervision mission consisted of an economist/financial analyst along with an electrical engineer. This
allowed the mission to deal with the two main continuing issues, the financial condition of ESM (which was
mostly good) and procurement plus project implementation. While supervision was good, if additional
budget had been available a third or fourth supervision mission in the year might have accelerated the
project somewhat. Even so the project was implemented on time.

7.3 Overall Bank performance:
Overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory.

Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
The project was prepared by the Bank and ESM with the assistance of outside consultants.The latter
primarily reviewed ESM's plans for soundness. Preparation by ESM was quite satisfactory. ESM
Management had a clear vision of what needed to be done which was confirmed by the consultants.

7.5 Government implementation performance:
The Government's performance was satisfactory. Its main role was to maintain a satisfactory level of
electricity prices which provide ESM with sufficient funds to self finance its part of the project. It also
established legislation which helped to attract private investors to the sector.

7.6 Implementing Agency:
The implementing agency, especially the PIU, did an outstanding job. They undertook to coordinate a
number of contractors who were working on the plants at the same time and coordinate the outage of the
plants with the electricity needs of Macedonia all the while there were various types of civil disturbances
occurring in the area of the plants. The Borrower's comments elaborate on the difficulties they had to
overcome. Also this was done entirely with ESM staff. No foreign experts were hired for this purpose.

7.7 Overall Borrower performance:
This is rated as satisfactory.

8. Lessons Learned

The borrower had very specific opinions about the lessons that were learned from the project. These are



                                                     - 9 -

that the following steps are vital:

l Careful selection of the members of the PIU team and insisting on keeping the team as
    compact as possible with no changes in the team during the entire project period.
l Arrangements for adequate training of the PIU team immediately after the project's
    approval and before the real start of the project.
l The members of the PIU team should be released from any other obligations at the
    company, allowing them to devote their time fully to the projects tasks and their
    successful implementation.
l At the beginning of the project, the PIU team should be fully organized and equipped
    with all     necessary technical goods, such as adequate office space, phones, fax & copy
    machine, printers, cameras, car, stable and fast Internet connection, etc.
l The contacts between PIU members and Contractors should be as frequent as possible,
    even on a daily basis if applicable.
l The contacts between PIU members and the Bank Team Leader or his representative
    should be more frequent then regular Bank's missions. This could improve the overall
    project performance and support all necessary discussions about all pending issues on
    the project and its implementation.

The Bank team has no disagreements with the above conclusions. However, in addition this project
reinforces the lesson that worthwhile projects take considerable time to complete and rushing them greatly
increases the chances of failure. This project took 7 years from start to completion - as planned. If it had
been a five year project it would have had to be extended or would not have been anywhere near as
successful.


9. Partner Comments

(a) Borrower/implementing agency:
Prepared by ESM's PIU
Power System Improvement Project (PSIP) was one of the most important projects in the energy sector
taken after the separation of the Republic of Macedonia from the Former Yugoslav Federation. The
complexity of the project, its interdisciplinary structure and the importance that it has for the electricity
sector in the country, made this project most attractive on one side for the contractors and on the other side
an implementation challenge for the Electric Power Company
(ESM) as implementation agency.

This project consisted of several sub-components that required significant technical knowledge and
managerial capacities to be successfully implemented in the originally designated time frame. The Loan
Agreement with IBRD was signed in mid-1998, and the project closing date was: June 30, 2005. We can
proudly say that this final deadline was achieved with results which in some cases are even better than
expected.

The main issues and problems that we faced during the project implementation were:

1.       The first and probably the most difficult decisions was to select the type and the number of
contracts as well as an adequate division of sub-components of the project. The final decision was to split
the entire project into a number of smaller sub-project in accordance with the type of the goods, equipment
and services, as well as to determine the need for consulting services. As a result, for the whole project the


                                                    - 10 -

PIU had to closely monitor more than 20 different contracts with almost as many as contractors, most of
them executed in parallel, which was extremely complex, time consuming and sometimes difficult to
manage. On the one hand this method enabled the PIU to select the best contractors for many separate and
specific types of equipment and therefore, to optimize the cost and quality, while on the other hand the costs
for coordination and completion of the project and its outcome was assumed by the PIU i.e. ESM as the
implementation agency. To be more precise, the PIU had different contracts for turbines, for generators and
excitation, for switchgear and switchyard equipment, and for control equipment; however, the cost for
coordination of the jobs, inter-contractors obligations, etc, was entirely transferred to the PIU team making
implementation extremely difficult and sometimes time-consuming. Therefore, as a first suggestion, the PIU
suggests in such projects to combine similar types of equipment as much as possible. For example, we
could reduce the number of packages to two or three , for example, all hydro-mechanical equipment in one
package, and all electrical equipment in another package, possibly including control systems in different
packages or their inclusion in the electric package. In this case, we would have two or three contractors and
coordination could be easier. However, this approach would most probably increase the cost of the entire
project.

2.       In the tender preparation phase, some foreign consulting companies were included (in our case
EdF ­ France). Although the consultants paid significant attention to tender document preparation, during
implementation of the project, many drawbacks to their work have been found, mostly due to their lack of
familiarity with the real situation at the plant level. Therefore, it seems that the use of local experts, as
many as possible from the power plants, should in future be strongly encouraged in order prepare the best
possible tender documents.

3.       As a result of the long implementation period for the whole project and changes in the company's
management, changes of members of the PIU team were significant and very unproductive, although the
Bank insisted that the PIU team remain stable and permanent. To aid in this matter we suggest that the PIU
team should report directly to the Bank's local representative and to only one responsible person from the
implementation agency, e.g. the general manager or the investment manager.

4.       The PIU team should be stable and established before the project implementation starts. Each
member of the PIU should have specific responsibilities and suitable training should be done prior to
project implementation. In our case, each member of our PIU team had to learn their job by themselves,
which opened considerable room for making mistakes. This is highly ineffective and unprofessional and
could lead to serious problems in the implementation.

5.       A special IT tool for project monitoring, especially financing and procurement issues should be
developed by the Bank or should be suggested by the Bank for unification of the results of implementation,
presentations and analysis. This IT tool should be freely available before each project starts to be
implemented and could give a realistic view of the project implementation at each moment. It could also aid
the Bank's Representatives during each mission to closely monitor the progress of project implementation
and if necessary provide an alert about any problems with the project and/or its implementation.

6.       Our project was unusual due its distributed implementation at various locations ­ six hydro power
plants, installation of OPGW along the transmission lines, National Dispatch Center in Skopje, and several
locations for installation of the power transformers.It was extremely difficult to follow day-to-day activities
at each and every location. The PIU had specially designated persons for each sub-project, however,
distributed teams of local experts at various locations would be very advantageous for timely project
implementation and for execution of all works to the required quality.




                                                     - 11 -

7.       Collaboration between the PIU and the Bank's Representatives was highly satisfactory. The Bank
dispatched its missions at least two times per year, however, during the problematic period of the Project
implementation (years 1999/2001) even more. The collaboration with the other Bank staff based in USA (
procurement division, disbursement division, legal advises, etc.) was also quite satisfactory. Small
problems made few delayed responses from the Bank on the PIU request due to problems encountered
during the project implementation. We suggest that the response time on any demand or request be as short
as possible and that the number of Bank missions be increased since very often they are important for the
implementation schedule and decrease possible occurrence of delays.

8.       During the implementation period 1998 ­ 2005, our country was directly or indirectly involved in
two major conflicts; in 1999 in Serbia and Kosovo, and in 2001 a civil conflict in Macedonia. These were
the main problems that lead to delays in the project implementation, especially due to the recommendation
all over the world to avoid Macedonia as a risky country. The Bank Team was very cooperative during all
this period and trusted our PIU that albeit this was a serious situation, the full realization of the project
would not be unduly delayed. This reflected positively on the whole PIU team who with additional efforts in
combination with the Contractors successfully achieved all tasks to the defined quality and on time.

9.       The PIU would like to acknowledge that full project implementation was achieved under very
difficult conditions due to lack of additional available generation capacity to replace those units which are
under rehabilitation, increased energy demands in the country, and tough operational schedules. Usually,
we had to work under huge time pressures, which revealed that this method of implementation is not easy
and should be avoided in future if possible. This was further aggravated in cases when two or more units of
the same plant or at different plants were under rehabilitation. We suggest that in future for such complex
projects, better scheduling is applied in coordination with, the National Dispatch Center, the contractors
(all of them) and the PIU team members, in order to avoid such highly stressed situations. Shutting one unit
until its full rehabilitation is done is one of the options, however this is not always possible, especially in
the case of full control system replacement for the entire power plant. In general, the PIU was satisfied with
the level of cooperation with the contractors selected for this project.

Annex 3. Economic Costs and Benefits

There is a complete description of this issue in Section 4. Attached below is the summary table.

It should be noted that the total project includes costs for the dam safety and the PIU components, for
which no benefits could be readily calculated although there were clearly significant benefits. As a result of
these two cost items the overall project NPV is less than the sum of the NPVs for the three components for
which benefits were calculated.

Annex 7. List of Supporting Documents

The P drive ( P:\Macedonia\Energy\Power) has a large set of documents on this project. These include the
Staff Appraisal Report about 20 Aide Memoires, letters, some spread sheets etc. They cover the period
from 1997 to September 2005 and include over 200 documents. However, there is also some overlap in the
documents on that drive. The legal documents are also available although not in the P drive.
