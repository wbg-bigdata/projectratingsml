MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A LOAN TO STEG WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBUC OF TUNISIA
FOR A GAS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT.
1.          This memorandum and recommendation for a proposed loan to the Societ6
Tunisienne de l'Electricit6 et du Gaz (STEG) with the guarantee of the republic
of Tunisia, for US$60 million equivalent is submitted for approval. The proposed
ioan will be on standard IBRD terms with seventeen years of maturity including
five years grace and will finance a Gas Infrastructure Development Project.
Backgound
2.          The Energy sector plays an important, although declining, role in
Tunisia's economy.  Petroleum exports account for about 15% of total exports
while oil revenues represent over 20% of budgetary receipts.   In addition,
petroleum products supply over 65% of the country's energy requirements.  In
recent years, however, oil production has been declining and steadily threatening
the country's export base. One implication of this trend is that Tunisia is
likely to become a net oil importer during the 1990s despite the Government's
efforts to attract additional foreign investment for oil exploration. Against
this background, the Government has accelerated its efforts to enhance the
efficiency of energy use in the economy and to actively promote the use of the
lowest cost sources of energy.
3.          The Government's diversification strategy strives, in the short and
medium-term, to identify the least-cost fuels mix for the industrial sector and
for power generation and in the long-term, to develop new and renewable domestic
energy resources.    The availability, in recent years, of imported Algerian
natural gas from the trans-mediterranean pipeline (TMP), which connects the
Italian gas market to the Hassi R'Mel field in Algeria, has induced a substantial
increase in the use of natural gas as a replacement for fuel oil in electric
power generation from 38% in 1983 to 76% in 1989. However, as indicated by the
results of a recent fuel substitution study, there is still scope to make more
and better use of natural gas in the power subsector and more significantly in
the industrial, tertiary and residential sectors, where penetration of natural
gas has been limited despite its potentially high economic and financial
benefits.

4.          The key objective of the Bank's  macroeconomic assistance strategy
is   to allow Tunisia to achieve sustained growth in the framework of an
internally and externally balanced economy.   For the energy sector,  this
translates into a strategy based on promoting policies for, and facilitating the
adaptation of the Tunisian economy to, a more diversified and lower cost energy
supply mix, and providing the incentives and institutional support necessary for
more efficient energy use.  In recent years, both Bank lending and technical
assistance operations have supported this strategy.   An energy conservation
demonstration project (LN 2735) has provided the framework for an energy audit
program and contributed to strengthening the capacities of the Agence pour la
Maitrise de l'Energie (AME). This project was also helpful to introduce



- 2 -
significant improvements in the existing legislative framework for energy
conservation in the main user sectors.
5.          On the supply side, there has been an extensive program of support
to the power company, STEG, and a petroleum exploration promotion loan, to
support Government's efforts in attracting foreign investors, (Loan No. 3023-
TUN approved in 1989). Two joint studies, one to assess the country's long-
term fuel supply options and another to examine energy consumption patterns in
the household sector, were both completed with the support of the Energy Strategy
and Management Assistance Program (ESMAP).   The energy substitution study
thoroughly reviewed the technical, economic and significant environmental
implications of the two main options for diversification, imported coal and
natural gas, and was instrumental in leading to a strategic decision by STEG in
favor of natural gas fired power stations - including combined cycle - at least
until the year 2000.
6.          The proposed project would be a further step toward promoting greater
utilization of natural gas which is cheaper and cleaner for the environment than
commercial fuel alternatives. It would also contribute to the resolution of a
number of important questions relating to the pricing and institutional framework
for natural gas operations in the Tunisian energy sector.   Furthermore, the
Bank's involvement in the project is particularly appropriate given the regional
cooperation implications of increasing Algerian gas use by Tunisia.
En QNGR a"t b
7.          Associated gas production from the El-Borma oil field is declining
rapidly as this field nears depletion. As a result, the Gabbs region, the main
industrial center in southern Tunisia, will face a significant energy supply
deficit by 1993, since it depends on this associated gas for fuel supply. Bank
analyses have confirmed that it would be more economic to continue to supply
Gabbs and its region with natural gas rather than convert existing industries
to fuel oil and transfer some of STEG's power generation facilities in Gabbs
further north on the TMP. Consequently, the objectives of the project are to
(i) provide a least-cost energy supply alternative for the Gabbs region and other
gas markets along the pipeline route; (ii) develop a gas infrastructure network
in the southern part of the country to facilitate domestic gas field
developments; (iii) develop a sound gas subsector strategy while rationalizing
and strengthening the subsector's institutional set up; (iv) promote increased
penetration of natural gas in the industrial and premium fuels markets; and (v)
enhance the security of gas supply in Tunis.  The project will achieve these
objectives by supporting po' icy and institutional changes and financing
investments as follows:
(a) Construction of a 240-km Pipeline Between M'saken and Gabes. Among
the several options considered for supplying Gabbs with imported
natural gas, the co-struction of a North-South pipeline between
M'saken and Gabbs turned out to be the most attractive one, based
on existing demand in the Gabbs area as well as that of major
industrial regions (Sfax, Skhira and Sahel) along the pipeline route.
The pipeline would connect the southern gas network to the northern
grid and the TMP, thus permitting the transport of gas to Gabbs.



- 3 -
(b)   Security of suDDlv in the citg of Tunis.  The proposed projo3ct will
finance the completion of an existing loop around Tunis, to address
immediate security concerns as a short-term measure. Regarding long-
term gas supply security concern, the project will provide support
for a study to: (i) review the network configuration options and
recommend a least-cost solution to improve the security of gas
supply; and (ii) design a nation-wide supervisory control and data
acquisition system (SCADA), to ensure the optimal management of the
country's gas supply network.
(c)   Rationalization and Development of the Gas Subsector. In the future,
natural gas is likely to play an increasing role in the Tunisian
fuels market for the following reasons.   First, increased fuel
substitution will be needed to reduce the country's cost of energy.
Gas, with its high economic benefits relative to refined petroleum
products, will like}.y take an increasing share in the fuel market.
Second, the planned capacity of the TMP will almost double in the
mid 1990s to tap emerging gas markets in Europe, including, Italy,
Yugoslavia and possibly Czechoslovakia. Therefore, it is expected
that Tunisia will significantly increase its transit rights. As a
result of these changes, the efficient management and marketing of
Tunisia's increased gas resources will be critical, and will require
an appropriate framework for the development of the gas subsector,
including pricing policies and strategies to promote gas penetration
in the industrial, residential and commercial sectors. Consequently,
the proposed project will support a study to: (i) investigate and
recommend appropriate institutional arrangements for the development
of the gas subsector, including options for private sector
involvement in gas distribution; and (ii) recommend pricing policies
and strategies to promote further consumption of gas in the
industrial, residential and commercial sectors, including alternative
schemes for financing consumer connection and/or conversion costs.
(d)   Technical Assistance and Training.  The proposed project will also
provide technical assistance and training services to relevant STEG
staff in gas sales, engineering and conversion.
8.          The  estimated  total  project  cost,  excluding  interest  during
construction (IDC), is US$98.6 million with a foreign exchange component of US$60
million which the Bank will finance. STEG will borrow directly from the Bank
and be responsible for project implementation.  A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in schedule A. All goods and services financed by the
proposed loan will be procured in accordance with Bank guidelines. Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements as well as the disbursement schedule
are shown in schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events, and the
status of Bank group operations in Tunisia, are given in schedules C and D,
respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 9546-TUN dated October 16, 1991
is also attached.

9.          Issues.  The following issues, critical to the development of the
natural gas subsector in Tunisia, will require careful attention. First, it is
now Tunisia's policy to promote gas use in the premium fuels market where the
substitution would yield the highest economic benefits.   However,  several
constraints impede the expanded use of gas in this market. These include: (a)
the high connection/conversion costs for small consumers relative to their
capacity to pay; and (b) the insufficient marketing and promotion of gas to
potential consumers by STEG due to inadequate financial and human resources.
Second, STEG's presently good financial performance may, in the future,
deteriorate due to a number of factors which include: (a) STEG's expanded capital
investments to replace and supplement existing generating capacity over the next
five to six years; and (b) the expected increase in STEG's fuel costs resulting
from the increasing substitution of imported gas for domestic (El Borma) gas,
which STEG receives at virtually no cost and from the action proposed under this
project, to increase the transfer price of Algerian gas from ETAP to STEG . The
above adjustment is intended to ensure, for economic efficiency reasons, that
the transfer price of gas as well as current electricity tariffs, both of which
are presently slightly below their long-run marginal supply costs, reflect
economic cost.   Apart from these adjustments, energy pricing in Tunisia is
generally sound.  Given the above, STEG's continued financial viability will
require a number of actions including tariff increases, equity injections, as
well as other measures to strengthen STEG's balance sheet. Finally, there is
need to develop and implement an overall long-term strategy for the Tunisian Gas
subsector, and rationalize and strengthen its institutional organization.
10.         Actions Agreed.  The main policy objective of the proposed project
is to establish an appropriate framework for the development of the gas subsector
in Tunisia. To this end, it will provide the analytical foundations for tackling
the above issues and propose appropriate measures for their future resolution.
Consequently, during negotiations, the Bank, STEG and the Republic of Tunisia
agreed that:
(a)   STEG will prepare, by March 31, 1993, under terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Bank, a study on the feasibility of accelerating
natural gas penetration in the industrial, residential and commercial
sectors. The study will recommend: (i) a long-term gas strategy;
(ii) an appropriate institutional organization; and (iii) appropriate
policies for the pricing of gas at the retail level and the financing
of consumers conversion/connection costs, in order to expand gas use
in these sectors. STEG also agreed to review the recommendations
of the study with the Bank, and start implementing agreed
recommendations not later than June 30, 1993;
(b)   the Government will maintain all petroleum product prices at economic
cost, and adjust, by June 1994, electricity tariffs and the transfer
price of gas from ETAP to STEG to reflect their economic costs;
(c)   the Government and STEG will take all necessary measures to enable
STEG to achieve:



(1)   In the medium-term (1991-93): (i) a self-financing ratio of
its overall annual capital investment of at least 25%; and (ii)
starting in 1992, a debt service coverage ratio of at least
L5.
(2)   In the long-term (1994 and thereafter): a self-financing ratio
of its overall annual capital investment of at least 30%.
Als.,, in order to monitor the respective performance of
electricity and gas operations and ensure their long-term
viability; starting in 1994, both activities will generate
incomes sufficient to at least fully cover their total
respective costs of supply. Total supply costs of electricity
and gas are defined as fuel costs at border prices plus
distribution, other operating costs (including depreciation
and interest) and foreign exchange losses. STEG's projected
financial situation is expected to be satisfactory based on
the above targets;
(d)   Government and STEG will sign a performance contract, satisfactory
to the Bank, which outlines the mutual obligations of the State and
the enterprise.   Signature of the STEG performance contract is a
condition of effectiveness of the proposed loan. The performance
contract will provide an appropriate framework for the achievement
of these targets, which will be largely contingent upon the timely
implementation of tariff measures and/or equity increases by
Government;
(e)   STEG will prepare separate proforma financial zratements for its
electricity and gas operations and have its accounts audited from
1991 onwards by auditors acceptable to the Bank; and
(f)   STEG will submit to the Bank, by December 31, 1992, the environmental
standards and necessary codes of practices for the pipeline
construction and gas transmission as well as an emergency and safety
manual.
Environment
11.         The project has been reviewed under the provisions of Operational
Directive 4.00 Annex A (Environmental Assessmer:t) and placed in an environmental
screening category "B". A preliminary environmental assessment was conducted
by an international engineering firm in order to identify major environmental
issues related to the construction and transmission of the pipeline, to propose
mitigating measures which could be incorporated in the project and determine
whether an environmental impact assessment is necessary. The study concluded
that the pipeline route does not have an adverse effect on the environment, and
that an environment  impact assessment  is not necessary.   A copy of the
environmental screening is in the project file.
Prolect Benefits
12.         The proposed project would provide the least-cost solution for
meeting the energy needs for a major industrial center and power generation
plants in southern Tunisia, and enhance the security of gas supply in Tunis, the
capital. It would also help to establish the foundation for the gas subse.-tor's



- 6 -
long-term development strategy, and ultimately contribute to the penetration of
gas in market segments where its economic benefits are the highest, particularly
the premium fuels market in the residential and commercial sectors. The benefits
of expanded gas use include: (a) cost of foreign exchange savings through the
replacement of oil imports with cheaper gas imports; and (b) environmental
improvement since gas is a cleaner burning fuel in relation to oil.   The
investments financed under the project are expected to have an economic rate of
return of about 16X.
13.         The main risk associated with the project would be the cessation of
gas supply between Algeria and Tunisia.   However, this risk is considered
minimal, given that since 1984 the TMP has been operating under a 25-year
contract among several countries and gas from the pipeline meets about 30X of
Italy's gas demand. Difficulties may arise from lengthy procedures for land
acquisition from private land owners, although there are no people to be
resettled. Tunisian legal provisions governing land acquisition and related
compensation procedures were reviewed and found to be generally saticfactory.
To avoid delays in project implementation, STEG has established a project team
which will be responsible for land acquisition. Furthermore, STEG already has
initiated the legal procedures for acquiring the land. Concerning the economic
justification of the project there is, of course, an unlikely possibility that
the El-Borma field's current level of production would continue for the next five
years and this could have an impact on the project's rate of return. However,
resulcs of the sensitivity analyses indicate that, even in the unlikely event
El-Borma produces 50% above its planned levels, the project would still yield
a 10% return.
14.         I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank, and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the
proposed loan of US$60 million.
