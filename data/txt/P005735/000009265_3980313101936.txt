IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPUBLIC OF TUNISIA
GAS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3418-TUN)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Gas Infrastructure
Development Project in Tunisia for which Loan 3418-TUN in the amount of US$60
million was approved on November 26, 1991 and made effective on September 25, 1992.
The loan was closed on June 30, 1997, one year later than originally envisaged. The last
disbursement was made on November 12, 1997, at which time the undisbursed amount of
US$530,524 was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Jorge A. Larrieu, Principal Power Engineer. The ICR
was reviewed by the Country Operations Department (MNCMG) and by the
Infrastructure Development Group (MNSID). The Borrower provided its completion
report and comments on the ICR, which are incorporated as Appendix B and C,
respectively.
Preparation of the ICR began during a mission carried out by Mr. Larrieu in
December 1997 (Appendix A: includes the ICR's Mission Aide Memoire). It is based on
the Staff Appraisal Report, the guarantee and loan agreements, supervision reports,
correspondence between the Bank and the Guarantor and Borrower, internal Bank
memoranda, and interviews with Bank and Borrower officials and staff involved in
project implementation. Additionally, the Borrower directly provided the Bank with a
completion report on the implementation of project components.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA
GAS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3418-TUN)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Project Objectives
1.    The broad objectives of the project, as defined in the SAR, were to: (a) provide a
least-cost energy supply alternative for Gabes and other gas markets along the M'saken-
Gabes pipeline route; (b) develop a gas infrastructure network in the southern part of the
country in order to facilitate domestic gas fields' development; (c) promote increased
penetration of natural gas in the industrial and premium fuels markets; and (d) establish a
modem Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA). The institutional
development objectives of the project were to assist in developing: (i) a sound gas
subsector strategy while rationalizing and strengthening the subsector's institutional
setup; and (ii) an appropriate strategy for enhancing the security of gas supply. Also
important objectives of the project were to ensure that economic prices for electricity and
gas would be implemented and that the financial performance of the Societe Tunisienne
de l'Electricite et du Gaz (STEG) would be adequate.
2.    To achieve these objectives, the project included the following components: (a)
construction of a gas transmission pipeline of 240 km connecting the existing 20-inch
diameter pipeline in the north of M'saken to the existing industrial gas network in Gabes.
The pipeline will also supply gas to markets along its routing, including Sfax, Jemmel,
and Agareb; (b) construction of 7 km of 20" diameter and of 5 km of 8" pipelines along
the existing Tunis loop connecting the eastern and western parts of the network in order
to enhance the security of gas supply to Tunis; (c) studies related to: (i) security of gas
supply, along with identification of least-cost alternatives; (ii) conceptual design for the
nationwide SCADA system; and (iii) a Gas Subsector Development and Rationalization
study; and (d) training for STEG technical staff on SCADA, sales engineering, and
conversion of industrial facilities to natural gas. The economic and financial objectives of
the project were to be achieved by GOT through adequate adjustments of electricity and
gas tariffs which were covenanted in the Guarantee Agreement and the institutional
objectives through specific actions which were covenanted in the Loan Agreement(paras.
4-7).
Implementation Experience and Results
3.    Physical objectives were achieved. STEG completed, in a timely manner, the



- 11 -
construction of the gas pipelines, including: the main pipeline M'saken-Gabes and the
extensions to Jemmel, Agareb, Sfax and Miskar. Furthermore, the construction of the
Tunis loop pipeline extensions along the existing Tunis loop were commissioned as
scheduled. The expansion of the Zriba measurement center, the installation of the city
gate stations and of the metering/regulating, stations as well as the installation of the gas
network cathodic protection, were completed as scheduled. The consumer conversion
program and the purchase of maintenance equipment/vehicles were partially completed.
The Gas Subsector Development study was completed, however the conceptual design of
the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system (SCADA) design was not
implemented. Furthermore, the pipeline to connect the Miskar off-shore gas field (16 km)
was included in the project and financed under the Bank loan (paras. 11-15).
4.   Institutional objectives were partially achieved. As in previous Bank operations,
the Government delayed electricity tariff adjustments, thus continuing with the ongoing
practice of subsidizing STEG's power operations with the considerable surpluses
generated by its gas operations. Furthermore, GOT failed to level the retail prices for gas
consumers. In general, STEG's consolidated financial situation (electricity and gas) during
project implementation was satisfactory. STEG was able to meet the main financial
covenants set forth in the Loan Agreement with the Bank: internal cash generation, and debt
service coverage ratio. However, the financial performance of its electricity activity during
this period was quite disappointing as it again incurred substantial losses. (paras. 21-27).
5.    Electricity and Gas tariffs. The Government agreed with STEG under the 1992-
1996 "Contrat-Progranume" and with the Bank, under the Guarantee agreement, to increase
electricity tariffs by 6% per year. This agreement was not fully honored by the Government,
as the tariff adjustments did not take place as scheduled. The Government increased
electricity tariffs by 7% in 1992, 3% in 1993; 5.9% in 1994; and no increases were made in
1995, 1996, and 1997. The level of tariffs prevailing during 1992-1997 were neither
appropriate to recover cost based on economic principles, nor sufficient to at least break-
even in every year starting 1994. Regarding gas tariffs, they were increased by 10% in
1992, 8.6% in 1993, and 4.7% in 1994. GOT also failed to level retail prices for gas
consumers as they were well above economic costs (paras. 28-31).
6.    Project costs andfinancing. The project was completed at a cost of about
US$77.5 million, or 21.4% lower than the original appraisal estimate of US$98.6 million.
The decrease was mainly due to a significant cost reduction in the construction of the
pipelines (pipelaying) and lower taxes than originally envisaged. The Bank financed
US$59.47 million and STEG the balance, or US$18.03 million (paras. 33-34).
7.    Project economic performance. The project's economic performance was
reevaluated using the method described in the SAR. The actual economic rate of return is
31%, lower than the appraisal estimate of 38%. At appraisal, the estimated benefits of the



- 111 -
Miskar off-shore gas field (which were valued on the' basis of the international price of
heavy-fuel) were overestimated (para. 35).
Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
8.    The Government and STEG were fully committed to implementing the physical
part of the project; however, the Government was quite tepid in implementing the
measures needed to improve the financial performance in STEG's electricity activity. It
did not approve the required electricity tariff adjustments which would have allowed
STEG to recover the cost of service. Furthermore, it failed to level retail prices for gas
consumers. The physical components included in the project were completed, except for
the conceptual design of the SCADA (paras. 36-3 7).
9.    Procurement of goods and services was carried-out in a timely manner. The
processes utilized by STEG for selecting suppliers, contractors, and services were in line
with the Bank's competitive bidding guidelines. During project implementation nineteen
contracts were issued, of which sixteen were financed by the Bank and the balance by
STEG. Except for two small contracts for the supply of telecommunication and control
equipment, supply of goods and installation/civil works have been commissioned on
schedule (para. 38).
10.   Loan disbursement was slow at the initial stage of project implementation due to a
delay of some ten months in declaring the loan effective. The Bank extended the loan
closing date by one year to June 30, 1997. At the time of the last disbursement on
November 12, 1997, US$59.47 million, or 99.1% of the loan was disbursed. The balance
of US$530,523 was canceled. Furthermore, the Special Account was never opened; the
Bank and STEG agreed that it was not necessary since all contracts financed under the
Bank loan were awarded to foreign suppliers and contractors (paras. 39-40).
Bank Performance
11.   Overall project identification, preparation and appraisal was satisfactory. The
main components of the project were key elements to further develop the existing gas
network and meet the country's natural gas demand. However, the project did not include
a well-defined description and targets for the conversion component. Furthermore, the
Bank did not consider GOT's performance under previous loans concerning pricing
policies and compliance with the' commitment to adjust tariffs. These lessons should have
been taken into account in preparing the project. The Bank should have required from
GOT to increase power tariffs and lower retail prices for gas to economic levels, all as an
up front condition for approval of the loan. The Bank responded positively to GOT's
request to add to the project the financing of the 16 km-20" diameter spurline necessary
to connect the off-shore gas field at Miskar to the main M'saken-Gabes pipeline. The
participation and support provided by the Bank to the Government and STEG during



- iv -
project identification, preparation, and appraisal was satisfactory and efficient. The Bank
carried-out one identification, two preparation and one appraisal missions during the
period April 1989 through March 1991. Staff allocation between project identification
and loan approval amounted to about 110 staff-weeks, costing about US$317,100 (paras.
41-42).
12.   Project supervision. Between November 1992 and December 1996, five field
supervision missions were carried-out. The resources allocated during project
implementation amounted to about 47 staff-weeks at a cost of about US$178,500. The
frequency of supervision missions was adequate given that STEG had an excellent project
implementation team, and its suppliers and contractors were performing adequately. Bank
supervision was satisfactory. However, the Bank should have strictly enforced compliance
with the covenants regarding adjustment of electricity and gas tariffs in order to prevent the
project from departing from some of its institutional objectives (para. 43).
Guarantor and Borrower Performance
13.   Project preparation and implementation by STEG. The Borrower prepared the
project engineering design and technical specifications in a timely manner. It took the
Government about ten months to meet the conditions for loan effectiveness. Procurement of
goods and services was carried-out on time and the Government assisted STEG during
project implementation as necessary. The bulk of the project components was executed on
schedule. The loan closing date had to be extended by one year. On the negative side, the
Government did not increase electricity tariffs during 1995, 1996, and 1997, despite the
Bank' s insistence on the importance of increasing electricity tariffs and eliminating
subsidies at a fast pace. The overall performance of STEG is considered highly
satisfactory. The overall performance of the Guarantor during project implementation is
considered marginally satisfactory, except on financial matters, for which its performance is
considered unsatisfactory (paras. 44-46).
Project Sustainability
14.   The prospect for the project to be sustainable is certain. This is based on the
following: (i) the project's actual rate of return is adequate; (ii) the facilities built under
the project are central to the objectives of reducing gas imports from Algeria, replacing
the use of polluting/less efficient liquid fuels, and supplying additional gas to the market
in the south; (iii) STEG was able to further enhance adequate institutional capacity to
expand and operate its gas activities and establish satisfactory national standards for gas
transportation and distribution; and (iv) the current financial situation of STEG's gas
activities as well as the corresponding prospects are satisfactory (para. 47).



_v 
Project Outcome
15.   The outcome of the project is satisfactory. The project has been successfully
completed while achieving most of its objectives. This is supported by the following: (i)
the facilities financed under the loan were commissioned on time and at lower cost than
expected at appraisal; (ii) the economic rate of return of the project is adequate; (iii)
STEG's consolidated performance and compliance with major covenants was, in general,
satisfactory; (iv) STEG's overall institutional capacity and its coordination with sector
entities continues to be satisfactory; and (v) the project sustainability is certain (para. 48).
Future Project Operation
16.   The increasing demand for gas, STEG's institutional capacity, and the existing
pricing policy for petroleum products provide an adequate environment for establishing a
satisfactory program for future project operation. Furthermore, the ongoing program for
promoting private investrnent in the sector is expected to enhance the environment for
satisfactory operation of the project. The concession to British Gas for the exploration and
operation of the Miskar gas field and the ongoing negotiations with an Independent Power
Producer for the combined-cycle power plant at Rades illustrate the GOT's willingness to
open the sector to private investors (paras. 49-50).
Key Lessons Learned
17.   Despite the satisfactory preparation, implementation, and outcome of this project,
there are four lessons which can be offered:
Lesson 1: The lack of legal enforcement of the contract between the Government
and STEG ("Contrat-Programme") did not allow the utility to improve the finances
of its electricity operations. In this respect, this contract was not an useful tool for
achieving the intended objectives. In the absence of the corresponding legal
instruments, this contract was somewhat helpful for establishing roles and
promoting some dialogue between STEG and GOT. The validity of this agreement
is questionable and its effectiveness was minimal.
Lesson 2. GOT did not comply at the later stages of project implementation with its
commitment to adjust electricity tariffs and Bank management was reluctant to
enforce the corresponding covenants. Bank management and staff should strictly
enforce compliance with critical covenants to prevent the project from departing
from some of its institutional objectives as well as to preserve the Bank's credibility,
irrespective of considerations such as closing dates.
Lesson 3. The conversion component of the project did not include a well-defined
description and targets. As a result, only four (out of fourteen) industrial



- vi -
undertakings were able to convert their facilities to use gas. In general, the project
design should very detailed and comprehensive. In particular, this project
component should have explicitly defined, based on a sound survey, a realistic
program and the type and number of conversions to be achieved each year.
Detailed and comprehensive project description and implementation targets are
essential.
Lesson 4: The lessons from previous gas projects in Tunisia, in particular those
concerning pricing policies and compliance with the commitment to adjust tariffs,
should have been taken into account in preparing and implementing the project.
Under Loan 3418-TUN, the Bank should have required from GOT to increase
power tariffs and lower retail prices for gas to economic levels, all as an up front
condition for approval of the loan.



IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA
GAS INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 3418-TUN)
A. Statement and Evaluation of Objectives
Introduction
1.    The energy sector represents an important, although declining, portion of the
Tunisian economy. In particular, during 1996 petroleum exports accounted for about
7.1% of total exports, while oil revenues represented about 6.7% of budgetary receipts
(10.1% and 9.9% respectively in 1991). Furthermore, petroleum products and natural gas
during 1996 represented about 62% and 36% respectively, of the country's primary
energy available and about 76% and 11% respectively, of the final consumption of
commercial energy. During the last decade, oil production has been declining despite the
Government's efforts to attract foreign investments for oil exploration. However, the
Government has intensified its efforts to enhance efficient use of energy and to diversify
its sources. The availability of imported Algerian gas from the Trans-Mediterranean
Pipeline (TMP) and of the gas from the Miskar off-shore field has induced a considerable
increase in the usage of gas for power generation and industrial processes as a
replacement for liquid fuels.
2.    When the Gas Infrastructure Development Project was prepared in 1990, the
southern part of Tunisia faced critical natural gas shortages due to the rapid depletion of
the El Borma gas field. In order to reverse this trend and in the absence of prospects to
develop gas fields in this region, the construction of a pipeline linking the TMP to the
south was undertaken because its economic attractiveness. The pipeline supplies gas to
major industrial consumers in the Gabes, Sfax, Agareb, and Jemmel areas; allows STEG
to further develop gas-fueled power plants in the region; and links the Miskar off-shore
gas field with consumption centers.
Experience Under Previous Projects
3.    The project was the Bank's third operation in Tunisia's gas subsector. During the
period 1971-1991 the Bank made three loans totaling US$94 million. These have assisted
Tunisia in expanding STEG's natural gas network. The projects financed under the two
previous loans, 724-TUN and 1864-TUN, approved in January 1971 and June 1980
respectively, were successfully completed, however with some problems. Their
corresponding ICRs confinned both, the appropriateness of the project components and
the problems faced during their implementation. Furthermore, these. loans have also
attempted to improve the finances and organization of STEG and the energy sector as



2
well as its economic and operational performance. Loan 341 8-TUN (the subject of this
ICR) is a follow-up to the two previous loans, in particular regarding further development
of natural gas utilization as well as financial and institutional aspects of the sector.
Project Objectives and Components
4.    The broad objectives of the project were to: (a) provide a least-cost energy supply
alternative for Gabes and other gas markets along the M'saken-Gabes pipeline route; (b)
develop a gas infrastructure network in the southern part of the country in order to
facilitate domestic gas field development; (c) promote increased penetration of natural
gas into the industrial and premium fuels markets; and (d) establish a modern supervisory
control and data acquisition system (SCADA).
5.    The institutional development objectives of the project were to assist in
developing: (a) a sound gas subsector strategy while rationalizing and strengthening the
subsector's institutional setup; and (b) an appropriate strategy for enhancing the security
of gas supply. These objectives were to be met through actions specified and covenanted
in the guarantee and loan agreements. Additionally, other important objectives of the
project were to ensure that economic prices for electricity and gas would be implemented
and that the financial performance of STEG would be adequate. The economic and
financial objectives of the project were to be achieved by GOT through adequate
adjustments of electricity and gas tariffs which were covenanted in the Guarantee
Agreement.
6.    The physical objectives of the project were to support STEG in: (i) developing a
gas transmission linkage between the north and south of the country; (ii) enhancing the
gas distribution network flexibility in the city of Tunis and the security of gas supply; and
(iii) expand consumer connections, metering, and regulating stations.
7.    To achieve these objectives, the project included the following components:
(a) construction of a gas transmission pipeline of 240 km connecting the existing
20-inch diameter pipeline in the north of M'saken to the existing industrial gas
network in Gabes. The pipeline will also supply gas to markets along its routing
including Sfax, Jemmel, and Agareb.;
(b) construction of 7 km of 20" diameter and of 5 km of 8" pipelines along the
existing Tunis loop connecting the eastern and western parts of the network in
order to enhance the security of gas supply to Tunis;
(c) expansion of the Zriba measurement center;
(d) installation of 3 city gate stations and 14 metering/regulating stations;



3
(e) conversion of 14 industrial facilities using liquid fuels to natural gas along the
pipeline;
(f) provision of maintenance equipment and vehicles;
(g) studies related to: (i) security of gas supply, along with identification of least-
cost analysis; (ii) conceptual design for the nationwide SCADA system; and (iii)
Gas Subsector Development and Rationalization Study addressed to identify,
evaluate, and recommend least-cost alternatives, gas market, and improvement of
the organization and efficient operation of the gas subsector; and
(h) training for STEG technical staff on SCADA, sales engineering, and
conversion.
8.    The project, once completed, was to interconnect through a 240 km gas pipeline
the southern part of the country (Gabes) to the northern gas network (M'saken) in order to
supply additional gas to the city of Gabes and other new markets, improve the security of
gas supply in the area of Tunis, and enhance STEG's planning, managerial, and financial
capabilities. The project's objectives were relevant to the gas subsector of Tunisia as they
were in line with those pursued by the Government and the Bank. The objectives were
clearly stated in the Staff Appraisal Report. The overwhelming reason why the project
focused on the gas interconnector was the critical gas shortage in the south of Tunisia due
to the depletion of the El Borma gas field and the urgent need to meet gas demand in this
area. Furthermore, it was appropriate to include in the project components addressed to
enhance STEG's planning and financial capabilities.
9.    The original project's components were appropriate to achieve the physical
objective of extending additional gas supply to the south at least cost. They were also
suitable to pursue the important institutional development objective of improving sector
planning and operational performance. However, despite STEG's adequate overall
financial performance during the implementation of the project, the Government failed to
comply with its commitments under the project to periodically adjust electricity tariffs.
B. Achievement of Objectives
Implementation Organization
10.   The physical components were implemented by the beneficiary, STEG, through its
Gas Directorate, which setup a special project implementation unit. Overall project
coordination, financial matters, and loan disbursement administration were handled by its
Finance Department. STEG assigned very competent staff to manage the project and they
performed very well during all stages of project execution. Furthermore, the suppliers and
contractors retained by STEG for the supply of equipment and materials and for the



4
installation and construction works of the different components were very competent and
experienced. The project components were completed in a timely manner and, in general,
at costs below the original estimates. STEG performance as implementing agency is
considered highly satisfactory.
Physical Objectives
11.   The bulk of the physical objectives were achieved. STEG completed the
construction of the gas pipelines on schedule. During December 1994 the main pipeline
was commissioned. This pipeline comprises three main sections: M'saken-Sfax (104 kin-
24" pipe diameter), Sfax-Miskar (27 km-20" pipe diameter), and Miskar-Gabes (106 km-
20" pipe diameter). The main pipeline also includes four spurs: the ones to the cities of
Jemmel and Agareb, the one to the city of Sfax (15 km-16" pipe diameter) and the one to
the Miskar gas field treatment station (16 km-20" pipe diameter). Furthermore, the
construction of the Tunis loop pipeline extensions (6.2 km-20" pipe diameter and 1.5 km-
8" pipe diameter, respectively) along the existing Tunis loop connecting the eastern and
western parts of the network was commissioned during September 1995.
12.   The expansion of the Zriba measurement center and the installation of six
regulating stations, eight metering stations, six gas quality control posts, and the gas
network cathodic protection against pipeline corrosion were completed during the period
December 1994 through June 1997. Only four industrial facilities using liquid fuels
(instead of the 14 foreseen at appraisal) were converted to natural gas. Furthermore, these
four industrial undertakings financed with their own sources the costs associated with the
conversion works.
13.  STEG maintenance equipment and vehicles: Albeit the reduced scope (less
quantities than estimated at appraisal), the maintenance equipment and utility vehicles
for construction and maintenance work were purchased during the period 1994-1996.
This equipment is helping STEG to enhance its maintenance and operational practices in
gas transmission and distribution.
14.   Studies: The scope of the Security of Gas Supply Study, along with identification
of least-cost alternatives, were incorporated into the Gas Subsector Development and
Rationalization Study. The combined study was completed in October 1997. The quality
of the study is adequate and its conclusions and recommendations meet the intended
objectives set at appraisal. The study will assist STEG to identify, evaluate, and
recommend least-cost alternatives, gas market, security of supply measures as well as
improvement of the organization and efficient operation of the natural gas subsector. The
study for the conceptual design for the nation-wide SCADA system was never carried
out. STEG intends to execute this study during 1998.
15.   As the off-shore natural gas field at Miskar developed by British Gas was to be
operational by end of 1995, STEG requested that the 16 km-20" diameter spurline
necessary to connect the Miskar gas treatment plant to the main pipeline M'saken-Gabes



5
be financed with proceeds of the Bank loan. Since the operation of this pipeline was
envisaged for some time and given its highly economic benefits, this proposal was
accepted by the Bank during 1993. It was further agreed that the supply and installation
of this spurline (costing about US$3 million) would be contracted as an extension to the
ongoing contracts for the main pipeline M'saken-Gabbs (using the same supplier and
contractor and under the same terms and conditions).
Technical Operations
16.   Total natural gas requirements have increased from 939,000 toe in 1991 to
1,800,000 toe in 1996, an average yearly increase of about 14%. The actual growth rate is
higher than the appraisal estimate of 9% (1,440 toe in 1991 and 2,138 toe in 1996). During
1991 local gas production from El Borma amounted to 230,000 toe (26%), while imports
from Algeria amounted to 698,000 toe (74%). In 1997 local gas production is expected to
amount to 1,606,000 toe (68%) due mainly to the production of the Miskar off-shore gas
field (1,420,000 toe), El Borma is expected to produce 140,000 toe, and the balance (32%)
will be imported from Algeria. It should be noted that the actual production rate of the
Miskar gas field amounts to 1,540 toe/year while at appraisal it was estimated at 990
toe/year. STEG's power plants are the largest users of gas (over 70%). STEG's gas sales to
consumers increased from 383,000 toe in 1991 to 524,000 toe in 1996, an annual increase
of about 7%. The actual growth rate is lower than the appraisal estimate of 10% (379 toe in
1991 and 610 toe in 1996). The number of STEG's connections increased from 50,254 in
1991 to 85,604 in 1996 (Table 1.1). The growth of the Tunisian gas market is mainly due
to the increasing demand of gas for power generation and to a much lesser extent to the
usage by the industrial and commercial sectors, where natural gas penetration is progressing
slowly due to high retail tariffs (see para. 30 below).

17.   Electricity production increased steadily from 5,156 GWh in 1991 to 6,921 GWh in
1996 (average growth of about 7% per year), including electricity imports from Algeria and
purchase from local suppliers, while the number of electricity consumers increased from



6
1,453,966 users in 1991 to 1,875,090 in 1996. The actual growth rate is similar to the one
estimated at appraisal: 5,150 GWh in 1991 and 7,026 in 1996 (Table 1.2).

18.   During the period 1991-1996 STEG's gas transmission and distribution network
was expanded by the addition of 637 km of high pressure transmission pipelines, 47 km of
medium pressure pipelines, and 1,003 km of low pressure distribution pipelines (Table 1.3).

19,   STEG's installed power capacity grew from 1,329 MW in 1991 to 1,669 MW in
1996, an average growth of about 5% per year. Also, the power transmission and
distribution systems were significantly extended during the period 1991-1996, with the
addition of 200 km of 225/150/90-kV lines; 27,286 km of distribution lines (medium-low
voltage); 290 MW in power transformers; and over 7,800 medium and low-voltage
transformer banks (Tables 1.4 and 1.5).

20.   Energy losses. Power distribution losses, which include technical and non-technical
losses, have remained below 9% (8.8% in 1996). STEG devotes a considerable amount of
effort to keeping distribution losses within this range. STEG's losses in its high voltage
transmission system are about 2.7%. Both transmission and distribution losses are in line
with utility experience elsewhere and they do not pose a particular problem. Losses within
the gas network are negligible as they are below 1% (Table 1.6).

Institutional Objectives
21.   Institutional objectives were partially achieved. Although the overall consolidated
financial performance of STEG was satisfactory during project implementation, very
little was accomplished under the project regarding electricity rates, which were not
sufficient to cover the full financial costs of its power activity. As in previous Bank
operations, the Government delayed electricity tariff adjustments, thus continuing with
the ongoing practice of subsidizing STEG's power operations with the considerable
surpluses generated by its gas operations. On the latter, GOT failed to level the retail
prices for gas consumers, which are well above LRMC levels. In this respect, the
performance of the Government is considered unsatisfactory. The following paragraphs
detail the foregoing assessment.
22.   STEG'sfinancialperformance. In general, STEG's consolidated financial situation
and performance (electricity and gas) during project implementation was satisfactory. As a
result, STEG was able to meet the main financial covenants set forth in the Loan Agreement
with the Bank; i.e.; internal cash generation and debt service coverage ratio. However,
financial performance of its electricity activity during this period was quite disappointing as
it again incurred substantial losses. Under the Loan Agreement, STEG was obliged to at
least break-even by the end of December 1994. To achieve this target, the Government
agreed with the Bank under the Guarantee Agreement, and with STEG under the 1992-1996
"Contrat-Programnme", to increase electricity tariffs during this period by 6% per year over
and above any increases in the costs of fuel, wages, or servicing foreign exchange loans.
STEG's actual consolidated financial performance and the one estimated at appraisal are
summarized in Part II, Table 11. The variations between projected and actual performance
are mainly due to lower gas sales and higher heavy fuel and gas prices than the ones
projected at appraisal.
23.   STEG's selffinancing and debt service coverage. Through the period of project
implementation, internal cash generation from its consolidated operations (power and
gas) enabled STEG to finance a considerable amount of its annual investment
requirements. In this respect, STEG's financial performance was in general satisfactory.
Although it was covenanted under the Loan Agreement that this ratio should be not less



9
than 25% in 1991 through 1993, and not less than 30% thereafter, this ratio was as high
as 42% in 1996 and as low as 20% in 1994. The covenanted debt service coverage ratio
of 1.5 was in general met since this ratio varied from 1.4 in 1993 to 1.9 in 1995 (Table
1.7).
24.   STEG's electricity activity losses. As noted above (para. 22), the financial
performance of STEG's electricity activity was quite disappointing. The losses in this
activity varied from 13 TD millions in 1992 to 48 TD millions in 1994 (Table 1.7).

25.   Accounts receivable. STEG's performance regarding accounts receivable and
collection of arrears has been very satisfactory as it was able to maintain them below the
targets agreed upon with the Bank. The average collection period on accounts receivable
during project implementation was between 29-53 days, well within the 90 days
maximum allowed under Bank-financed projects (Table 1.8).

26.   STEG's auditing During project implementation, STEG submitted, on schedule, its
financial statements as well as the accounts of the project duly audited by MTBF-Price
Waterhouse, STEG's auditors. For reports the auditors concluded that STEG's financial
statements were adequate and that they accurately reflected its financial position.
Furthermore, STEG, for the first time, published separate audited accounts for its electricity
and gas operations for 1995 and 1996, as required by the Loan Agreement.
27.   STEG's "Contrat-Programme ". This contract for the period 1992-1996 between
the Government and STEG, a requirement under the conditions of loan effectiveness,
went into force during October 1992. It was established to enhance the technical
efficiency and financial situation of STEG. The "Contrat-Programme" specified the
measures to be taken by the Government and the complementary actions to be taken by
STEG. This Contract Program did not fully achieve its objectives, as the Government did
not meet its commitments regarding electricity tariff increases. As a result, STEG's
electricity activity did not perform as expected when the project was appraised. A new
1997- 2002 "Contrat-Programme" is now being discussed with the corresponding
authorities.
28.   Electricity tariffs. As mentioned above, the Government agreed with STEG under
the 1992-96 "Contrat-Programme" and with the Bank, under the Guarantee agreement, to
increase electricity tariffs during this period by at least 6% per year over and above any
increases in the cost of fuel, wages or servicing foreign exchange loans. This agreement was
not fuilly honored by the Government as the tariff adjustments did not take place as
scheduled. The Government increased electricity tariffs by 7% in August 1992, 3% in
October 1993, 5.9% in June 1994, and no increases were made in 1995,1996, and 1997.
Supervision missions raised this issue and informed the authorities that, unless actions were
taken promptly, the Bank may use the corresponding legal remedies, including suspension
of disbursements. However, Bank management was reluctant to use remedies given that the
loan closing date was imminent.
29.   The level of electricity tariffs prevailing during 1992-1997 were neither appropriate
to recover costs based on economic principles nor sufficient to at least break-even in every
year starting 1994. They have remained at an average of 0.062 TD/kWh since 1991. It is
estimated that prevailing electricity tariffs are about 18% below their long-run marginal cost
(LRMC) as an average, and as much as 20% below LRMC for low-voltage consumers.
Moreover, Bank supervision missions have repeatedly informed the Tunisian authorities
that it is necessary for them to index tariffs so changes in fuel prices, rate of exchange and
inflation can be passed on to consumers (Table 1.9).

30.   Gas prices. The price of the gas produced at Miskar is valued at 85% of the FOB
price of high-sulphur heavy fuel oil. Until 1995, the gas from El Borma was used by STEG
free of charge for power generation (associated gas with oil production which otherwise
would be flared). The price of the gas imported from Algeria is linked to a basket of eight
crudes and its level, in general, has been below the CIF price of high-sulfur fuel oil. Gas
prices for power generation (which represents over 70% of the total national consumption)
in general reflect economic costs. This is because Tunisia purchases the bulk of the gas
consumed in the country from Algeria (at a price which is similar to the one paid by Italy)
and from British Gas, the private undertaking which developed and now operates the
Miskar off-shore gas field (Table 1.10).

31.   Retail gas tariffs. The Government also increased retail gas tariffs by 10% in
August 1992, 8.6% in October 1993, and 4.7% in June 1994. The Government did not
authorize increases during 1995, 1996, and 1997. When gas price increases took place, they
were higher than the ones authorized for electricity prices. Retail prices, in particular for
medium and low-pressure consumers, are above economic costs (about 30% for low-
pressure consumers). This has prevented to some extent the rapid development (including
conversion) of the gas sector. STEG's gains from its gas operations continue to subsidize
the power activities. In this regard, GOT failed to comply with its undertakings with the
Bank under the Guarantee Agreement.

Training
32.   The training component was vaguely defined in the SAR and it provided funding
for training STEG's staff abroad in the area of SCADA systems, sales engineering, and gas
conversion technology. During project implementation STEG decided, with the Bank's
concurrence, that the loan proceeds available for this purpose would be not utilized to the
extent that bilateral technical assistance, mainly through Gaz de France, Italgas, and British
Gas, was available at better financial terms than the Bank, most of them non-reimbursable.
Thus the training component included in the loan was provided through the latter
arrangements. Although under different funding, it is considered that this project component
was duly implemented and that it had the intended impact on STEG.
Project Costs
33.   The project was completed at a cost of about US$77.5 million, of which US$60.3
million (or 78%) was the foreign exchange component. The actual cost of the project is
21.4% lower than the original estimate at appraisal, which was US$98.6 million. It should
be noted that the above costs are not comparable since the actual cost includes



13
expenditures corresponding to project administration (US$1.5 million) and to
pipeline/valves inspection (US$ 1.1 million), which were not included in the original
estimate made at appraisal. Furthermore, the conversion program was financed by the
industrial undertakings and the scope of the maintenance equipment/vehicles component
was reduced. Nevertheless, the 21.4% project cost underrun in dollar terms was due
mainly to a significant reduction in the cost of the civil works and the installation of the
pipelines (pipelaying) as a result of the very favorable contract conditions obtained from
the competitive bidding (about US$10 million equivalent in savings) and to lower import
tax rates applied to the project's foreign supplies (about US$7 million).
Project Financing
34.   The Bank financed US$59.47 million (about 77% of the US$77.5 million project
financing requirement). STEG financed the balance, or US$ 18.03 million (23%). The
contribution of local funds to project financing was not a problem since it represented less
than 2% of STEG's financing requirements for the period 1991-1997.
Project Economic Performance
35.   The project's economic performance was reevaluated using the method described
in the SAR; i.e., by calculating the internal rate of return of the stream of net benefits. Net
benefits of the program were taken as the difference between (a) the actual project capital
costs plus the actual charges financed either by STEG or consumers for
connection/conversion works. Furthermore, the cost of gas was based on actual import
prices from Algeria as well as on actual purchase price for the gas of Miskar. Gas
transport costs were estimated at 5 TD/toe and the pipeline operational costs at 2% of the
investment; and (b) the savings resulting from the project were measured by the value of
the refined products (63% high sulfur fuel oil, 20% gas oil, 12% low sulfur fuel oil, and
5% LPG) displaced by the incremental natural gas available as a result of the project.
Furthermore, the benefits due to the interconnection of the Miskar gas field as well as the
ones due to the positive environmental impact and to the consumers' convenience were
added. The refined products were valued at border prices adjusted for the delivery at the
consumer gate. The actual economic rate of return is 31%, lower than the appraisal
estimate of 38%. At appraisal, the estimated benefits of the Miskar off-shore gas field
(which were valued on the basis of prevailing and projected international prices of heavy
fuel) were overestimated (Part II, Table 12).
C. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting the Project
36.   The implementation of the physical components included in the project and the
performance of STEG and of its different contractors were highly satisfactory. The
project was instrumental in enhancing STEG's institutional capacity in the gas activities,
although the conceptual design of the SCADA system was not implemented. Regarding



14
STEG's financial performance, the overall financial objectives set with the Government
and STEG under the project were met; however, the major factor affecting the promotion
of economic pricing policies, in particular for electricity and gas, was the Government's
lack of commitment to implementing tariff adjustments.
37.   The Government and STEG were fully committed to carrying-out the physical part
of the project; however, the Government was quite tepid in implementing the measures
needed to improve the financial performance in STEG's electricity activity; e.g., it did not
provide financial autonomy to STEG to allow the recovery of cost of service through
proper and timely electricity tariff adjustments and to level retail prices for gas
consumers.
38.   Procurement of goods and services was carried-out on schedule. STEG's bidding
documents fully met the Bank's procurement requirements and the processes utilized for
selecting suppliers, contractors, and services were in line with the Bank's competitive
bidding guidelines. During project implementation nineteen contracts were issued, of
which sixteen were reviewed and financed by the Bank. STEG financed the balance.
Except for two small contracts for the supply of telecommunication and control
equipment, the supply of goods and the installation/civil works were commissioned on
schedule. The performance of suppliers and contractors was satisfactory, the supply of
goods and services was of good quality, and STEG's technical staff performed
satisfactorily in supervising the supplies and the works. STEG carried out the physical
components included in the project in a very satisfactory manner. The loan closing date
was extended by one year, and the project was completed except for the SCADA
conceptual design.
39.   Loan disbursement was slow at the initial stage of project implementation when
compared to the appraisal estimate. Disbursements began with a delay of about one year
and reached a cumulative level of about 71% of the appraisal estimate three years after
loan approval. The slow initial pace of disbursement was due to a delay of some ten
months in declaring the loan effective. The Bank extended the loan closing date by one
year to June 30, 1997 in order to allow payments for retention (guarantees) to suppliers
and contractors. At the time of the last disbursement on November 12, 1997, US$59.47
million, or 99.1% of the loan, was disbursed. The balance of US$530,523 was canceled.
40.   To facilitate disbursements and payments to some of the suppliers, the Bank and
the Government originally agreed that a Special Account was to be opened in the
Treasury. During project implementation, the Bank and STEG agreed not to open this
account in local currency because all contracts financed under the Bank loan were
awarded to foreign suppliers and contractors. The commercial terms of their contracts
required payment in foreign currencies and, in general, through letters of credit.
Therefore, the Bank paid all suppliers and contractors under the sixteen contracts.



15
D. Bank Performance
41.   Overall project preparation and appraisal were satisfactory. The main
components of the project, which included the main pipeline M'saken-Gabes, the
spurlines to Sfax, Jemmel, Agareb, and the pipelines to enhance the security of gas
supply within the Tunis loop, were key elements to further develop the existing gas
network and meet the country's natural gas demand. However, as in the previous
operation (Loan 1864-TUN), the project did not include a well-defined description and
targets for the conversion component. Although this component was smaller than in the
previous loan, it should have explicitly defined, based on a sound survey, a realistic
program, and the type and number of conversions to be achieved each year. As a result,
only four (out of fourteen) industrial undertakings were able to convert their facilities for
the usage of gas. Furthermore, the Bank did not consider GOT's performance under
previous loans concerning pricing policies and compliance with its commitment to adjust
tariffs. These aspects should have been taken into account in preparing and appraising
the project and the Bank should have required from GOT to increase power tariffs and
lower retail prices for gas to economic levels, all as an up front condition for approval of
the loan.
42.   The participation and support provided by the Bank to the Government and STEG
during project identification, preparation, and appraisal was satisfactory and efficient.
The Bank carried-out one identification, two preparation and one appraisal missions
during the period April 1989 through March 1991. Furthermore, staff allocation between
project identification and loan approval amounted to about 110 staff-weeks, costing about
US$317,100. The collaboration between the Tunisian authorities and the Bank during this
period was remarkable. The loan was approved in November 1991, signed in May 1992,
and became effective in September 1992.
43.   The Bank conducted a yearly supervision of the project. Over the 4 year-period
November 1992 to December 1996, five field supervision missions were carried-out. The
resources allocated during project implementation amounted to about 47 staff-weeks, at a
cost of about US$178,500. The frequency of supervision missions was adequate given
that STEG had an excellent project implementation team, its suppliers and contractors
performed adequately, and in general the project was problem free, except for the poor
financial performance of STEG's electricity activity. Throughout the implementation of
the project, Bank supervision was satisfactory. However, the Bank should have strictly
enforced compliance with the covenants regarding increases of electricity tariffs and
adjustments of retail prices of gas in order to prevent the project from departing from some
of its institutional objectives.



16
E. Guarantor and Borrower Performance
44.   Project preparation and implementation by STEG  was very efficient and
satisfactory. STEG prepared the project during the period 1990-1991, when project
engineering design and technical specifications were completed. It took the Government
about ten months to meet the conditions for loan effectiveness. As mentioned above,
procurement of goods and services was carried-out on schedule and the Government
assisted STEG during project implementation as necessary. The project was completed on
schedule and the bulk of the project components were executed in a timely manner.
Although the loan agreement provided for STEG to complete the project within six years
(the bulk of the facilities were commissioned within the original time frame), the loan
closing date had to be extended by one year in order to pay some of the retention
(guarantee) amounts due to suppliers. The key indicators of project implementation are
included in Part II, Table 5.
45.   On the negative side, the Government did not increase electricity tariffs during
1995, 1996, and 1997, despite the Bank advice regarding the importance of increasing
electricity tariffs and eliminating subsidies at a fast pace. Unfortunately, this lack of
compliance by the Government occurred at the later stages of project implementation and
Bank management was reluctant to use remedies given the imminent closing of the loan.
This situation was reported by the supervision missions, which raised this issue and
informed the Tunisian authorities. Furthermore, GOT failed to level retail gas prices to final
consumers. Part II, Table 13 includes the Status of Covenants.
46.   In view of the above considerations, the overall performance of STEG is considered
highly satisfactory because of the very good accomplishments of the Borrower (albeit with
some minor delays) in implementing the physical components of the project. However,
given the great importance that the Bank attached to STEG's electricity operations, the
overall performance of the Guarantor during project implementation is considered
marginally satisfactory, except on financial matters, for which its performance is considered
unsatisfactory on account of the failure to comply with important financial covenants
undertaken with the Bank and with STEG.
F. Assessment of Project Outcome and Sustainability
Project Sustainability
47.   The prospect for the project to be sustainable is certain. Despite the lack of full
action by the GOT regarding adjustment of electricity tariffs and lowering retail gas
prices, this assessment considers the sustainability of the project benefits assured. This is
based on the following: (i) the project's actual rate of return is adequate; (ii) the facilities
built under the project are paramount to the objectives of reducing gas imports from



17
Algeria, replacing the use of polluting/less efficient liquid fuels, and supplying additional
gas to the market in the south; (iii) STEG was able to further enhance adequate
institutional capacity to expand and operate its gas activities and to implement
satisfactory national standards for gas transportation and distribution; and (iv) the current
financial situation of STEG's gas activities as well as the corresponding prospects are
satisfactory.
Project Outcome
48.   The outcome of the project is satisfactory. The project has been successfully
completed while achieving the bulk of its objectives. This assessment is supported by the
following: (i) the facilities financed under the loan were commissioned in a timely
manner and at lower costs than expected at appraisal; (ii) the economic rate of return of
the project is adequate; (iii) STEG's consolidated performance and compliance with
major covenants was, in general, satisfactory; (iv) STEG's overall institutional capacity
and its coordination with sector entities continues to be satisfactory; and (v) the
sustainability of the project is certain.
G. Future Project Operation
49.   The country's increasing demand for gas, STEG's institutional capacity, and the
existing pricing policy for petroleum products, provide an adequate environment for
establishing a satisfactory program for future project operation. Key performance indicators
for project operation are included in Part II, Table 6.
50.   Furthermore, the ongoing program for promoting private investment in the sector is
expected to enhance the environment for satisfactory operation of the project. The existing
concession extended to British Gas for the exploration/operation of the Miskar gas field and
the proposed Independent Power Producer arrangement for the combined-cycle power plant
at Rades (under negotiation with the consortium Community Alternative Energy-Marubeni-
Sithe) are illustrative of GOT's willingness to open the sector to private investors. To the
extent that future power generation is likely to be undertaken by private investors and that
power plants will further operate utilizing natural gas, it is expected that this will provide
the adequate inducement to GOT to adopt electricity and retail gas prices which duly reflect
economic and market principles.
H. Key Lessons Learned
51.   Despite the satisfactory implementation of the project, there are four lessons (one of
which is not new to Bank operations) that can be offered:



18
Lesson 1: The lack of legal enforcement of the contract between the Government
and STEG ("Contrat-Programme") did not allow the utility to improve the finances
of its electricity operations. In this respect, this contract was not an useful tool for
achieving the intended objectives. In the absence of the corresponding legal
instruments, this contract was somewhat helpful for establishing roles and
promoting some dialogue between STEG and GOT. In general, the validity of these
agreements is questionable and its effectiveness is minimal.
Lesson 2. GOT did not comply at the later stages of project implementation with its
commitment to adjust electricity tariffs and Bank management was reluctant to
enforce the corresponding covenants. Bank management and staff should strictly
enforce compliance with critical covenants to prevent the project from departing
from some of its institutional objectives as well as to preserve the Bank's credibility,
irrespective of considerations such as closing dates.
Lesson 3. The conversion component of the project did not include a well-defined
description and targets. As a result, only four (out of fourteen) industrial
undertakings were able to convert their facilities to use gas. In general, the project
design should very detailed and comprehensive. In particular, this project
component should have explicitly defined, based on a sound survey, a realistic
program and the type and number of conversions to be achieved each year.
Detailed and comprehensive project description and implementation targets are
essential.
Lesson 4: The lessons from previous gas projects in Tunisia, in particular those
concerming pricing policies and compliance with the commitment to adjust tariffs,
should have been taken into account in preparing and implementing the project.
Under Loan 3418-TUN, the Bank should have required from GOT to increase
power tariffs and lower retail prices for gas to economic levels, all as an up front
condition for approval of the loan.

AIDE-MEMOIRE
1.          Une mission de la Banque Mondiale, compos6e de M. Jorge A. Larrieu, a visite la
Tunisie du 8 au 15 decembre 1997 pour preparer le Rapport d'Achevement du projet de
D6veloppement de l'Infrastructure Gaziere finance par le pret 3418-TUN. La mission remercie les
representants de la Direction Generale de l'Energie du Ministere de l'Industrie et de la Direction
Gen6rale de la Cooperation Intemationale du Ministere de la Cooperation Intemationale et de
l'Investissement Exterieur, ainsi que ceux de la STEG, pour la collaboration efficace et l'accueil qui
lui ont et6 reserves. L'aide-memoire r6sume les principaux sujets discutes et les accords conclus lors
de cette mission. La liste des personnes rencontrees se trouve en Annexe 1.
Rapport dAch&vement du Projet
2.          La mission a confirme aux representants de la Direction Generale de l'Energie du
Ministere de l'Industrie, de la Direction Generale de la Cooperation Internationale du Ministere de
la Cooperation Intemationale et de l'Investissement Exterieur, et de la STEG que, selon les
directives et accords des prets de la Banque mondiale, les beneficiaires des prets de la Banque sont
responsables de preparer un rapport d'achevement du projet. Le rapport doit etre prepar6 au plus
tard six mois apres la cl6ture dudit pret et il doit etre pr6par6 conjointement avec le rapport
d'achevement de la Banque.
3.          Le rapport de l'emprunteur est la derniere etape de suivi du projet. Conformement
aux directives de la Banque, il a e  convenu avec la STEG que le rapport d'achevement sera
soumis A la Banque avant le 31 decembre 1997. La mission a encourage les autorites responsables A
saisir cette opportunit6 pour faire une evaluation retrospective de l'execution du projet, de presenter
leurs points de vue independants et de preciser dans quelle mesure le projet a atteint ses objectifs
(physiques, institutionnels, financiers, et sectoriels), et de manifester librement leurs opinions sur la
qualite de la participation de la Banque.
4.          La mission a confirme aux autorites que le rapport d'achevement est en cours de
preparation par la Banque et qu'elle annexera le rapport pr6pare par la STEG et les commentaires
des autorites tunisiennes sur la partie prepare par la Banque. Ces annexes seront incorpores sans
modification. Le rapport final sera transmis aux membres du Conseil d'Administration de la
Banque et aux autorites responsables des Minist&res de l'Industrie et de la Cooperation
Intemationale et de l'Investissement Exterieur, et de la STEG.



5.           Les rapports d'achevement de la STEG et de la Banque devront faire le point sur les
realisations physiques, la passation de marches, les decaissements du pret, les etudes realisees, la
negociation et application du "Contrat-Programnme" entre le Gouvernement et la STEG. Par
ailleurs, il sera opportun que le rapport de la STEG exprime les raisons pour lesquelles le "Contrat-
Programme" n'a pas accompli les objectifs financiers envisages pour F'activite electricite de la
STEG (tarifs et r6sultat net). I1 faut remarquer que 1'evaluation de l'achevement des objectifs
physiques, institutionnels, et financiers envisages initialement est une partie importante et critique
des rapports. Les rapports devraient inclure aussi des opinions sur la qualite de la participation de la
STEG, des autorites responsables du secteur, de la Banque, et des fournisseurs des services et des
equipements.
Indicateurs de Performance du Projet et de la STEG

I- INTRODUCTION
Le projet de developpement de l'infrastructure gaziere en Tunisie a eci
pour r6pondife aux objectifs suivants:
- suppleer le gaz d'EL BORMA, en de&lin, qui alimentait les z8nes industrielles c
centrales electriques de la region de GABES depuis plus de 20 ans.
- developper un reseau d'infrastructure pour le gaz sur environ 250 Km des reg
cbtires du pays afin d'encourager la p-netration du gaz naturel particulirei
dans l'industrie et le tertiaire pour le remplacement du gasoil et du GPL.
- interconnecter les reseaux gaz Nord et Sud du pays afin de permetti
developpement de gisements nationaux de gaz et d'optimiser la gestion
approvisionnements et des disponibilites nationales en gaz.
- d6velopper une strategie appropriee destin&e an d6veloppement du secteur du ga
Dans le cadre du developpement de l'infrastructure gaziere en Tunisie
programme dans le VIII eme plan, un pret d'un montant de 60 millions de
dollars a ete octroye par la BIRD  a la STEG pour fmancer la part devises du
projet du gazoduc MSAKEN-GABES et 1'extension de la boucle de TUNIS.
II- DEROULEMENT DU PROJET
I1 Descriptif du proje
Le projet est constitue principalement d'une conduite gaz haute pression
reliant MSAKEN a GABES, de l'extension de la boucle de TUNIS (20 pouces, 20
bars ), d'equipements divers pour l'exploitation et la maintenance du reseau gaz
et de l'etude de developpement de linfrastructure gaziere.
Le gazoduc MSAKEN-GABES est compose (voir schema d'equipement):
- Du tronson Msaken-Sfax, de 104 Km, de diametre 24 pouces ( 609 mm),
- Du tronson Sfax-Gabes, de 134 Km, de diametre 20 pouces ( 508 mm ),
- De la conduite d'amenee du gaz de MISKAR, de 16 Km, de diametre 20 pouces,
- De la conduite d 'alimentation de SFAX, de 15 Km, de diametre 20 pouces.
L'extension de la boucle de TUNIS comporte:
-Une conduite de 6,2 Km, de diametre 20 pouces,
-Une conduite de 1,5 Km, de diametre 8 pouces ( 219 mm).



Les equipements divers pour 1'exploitation et la maintenance du riseau gaz
se decomposent comme suit:
* 6 postes de dhtente et un skid de regulation,
* 8 postes de comptage,
6 cabines de contr6le qualite gaz,
* 75 correcteurs de debit gaz ( PTZ),
* materiel de te'lcommunlication,
* materiel de maintenance.
2 / Marches contract6s pour les besoins du proiet
Le projet a fait l'objet de 20 contrats dont I resii6 et 16 finances par la
BIRD.
Le tableau en annexe 1, r6capitule les marches passes avec les diff&lents
fournisseurs pour l'acquisition du materiel et la realisation des travaux de pose
avec les montants respectifs ainsi que leurs dates de signature.
11 est a signaler que tous les contrats ont etSe menes a terme excepte celui
signe avec SIMET, pour l'acquisition des tubes pour la boucle de Tunis, qui a ete
resilie suite i la defaillance de ce fabricant. En remplacement, ces tubes ont e
acquis aupres du fournisseur des tubes pour la ligne principale MSAKEN-
GABES (MANNESMANN).
III - UTILISATION DU PRET
1 / Estimations des cofits et iustificatif des e'carts
Le cout.total du projet a ete initialement estime 'a 98,6 millions de Dinars.
Le co'ut definitif du projet s'eleve 'a 78,5 millions de Dinars. L'ecart de 20,1
millions de Dinars s'explique essentiellement par une realisation du marche
travaux de la pose du gazoduc pour un montant en deVai des estimations initiales
( environ 10 millions de dinars ). La reduction des taxes ( environ 7 millions de
dinars ) obtenue apres l'octroi au projet du privilege fiscal.
Le financement de ce projet a e assure par le pret BIRD 3418 TN 'a
concurrence de 60 millions de Dollars, soit 60 % du cofut global et le reste par les
fonds propres de la STEG, soit 40 %.



Le tableau en annexe 2, resume les ecarts entre P'estimation initale et les
montants effectiyement realis6s a la date de cloture du pret.
2 / Decaissements sur le nr&
Le montant total des decaissements sur le pret est de 59,47 milions de
dollars- . La part non utilisee, inferieure a 0,9 %, s'explique par la reduction du
cou't du projet.
Durant l'annee de prolongation qui a e  accordee par la banque ( du 30
juin 1996 au 30 juin 1997 ) pour l'utilisation du pr6t, les decaissements ont et de
7,88 millions de dollars.
Les reglements des marches finances par le pret ont fait l'objet de 100
demandes de paiement aupres de la BIRD dont 98 reglees directement aux
fournisseurs et le reste en remboursement de factures de3ji deboursees.
De ce fait, it n'a pas ete' necessaire de proceder i l'ouverture d'un compte
special.
Le tableau des d6caissements trimestriels sur le pret figure en annexe 3.
IV - SUIVI DU PROJET PAR LA BIRD
I / Ajwrobation des Appels d'Offres et des contrats
Les Appels d'Offres, les rapports de depouillement et les contrats ont e
elabores conformnment aux directives de la BIRD et lui ont ete systematiquement
adresses pour approbation.
11 est 'a signaler que les avis d'approbation par la BIRD ont W transmis
avec une celerite remarquable ayant contribue aux respects de delais du projet.
Un avis favorable a e  enregistre pour chacun des documents adressks pour
approbation a la BIRD.
2 I Missions de suivi de la BIRD
La BIRD a effectue, durant les 5 ann6es ( 1993-1997 ) 6 missions de suivi
pour constater I'avancement du projet et le bon deroulement de sa realisation.



Ces missions ont e  particulierement moti-antes pour 1'equipe du projet et
les conseils qui ont ete prodigues par la BIRD 'a la STEG ont bien contribue 'a la
bonne execition du projet.
V- EXECUTION ET SUIVI DU PROJET
Les ingenieurs et les techniciens de la STEG ont procede a l' estimation du
cofit du projet, effectue l'etude pr6liminaire du trace, calcule le dimensionnement
de la canalisation, fait le 4choix des equipements et ont enfin etabli les appels
d'offres et les contrats. Une equipe de projet a ete designee pour assurer le bon
deroulement des differentes operations de la re'alisation du projet.
Les radiographies de soudures, les epreuves reglementaires et le controIe
de la qualite des equipements en usine et sur chantier ont &W supervises par
l'equipe de projet et egalement par un organisme tunisien de contr8le agree par
le Ministere de l'Industrie, conformement 'a la r6glementation Tunisienne.
Les essais d'etancheite, de resistance et de mise en gaz ont &  concluants
des les premiers controles.
Le projet a ete suivi dans toutes ses phases par le Ministire de tutelle
(-Direction Generale de l'Energie et Direction de la Securite ) , ainsi que le
Ministere de la Cooperation Internationale et de l'Investissement Ext6rieur
(Direction Generale de la Cooperation Internationale).
Un controle scanner par racleur electronique effectuh en avril 1997 sur
toute la longueur de la conduite 24 pouces Sfax-Msaken a confirm6 la bonne
qualite de fabrication et de construction de l'ouvrage.
VI - APPORT DU PROJET
Le projet Gazoduc MSAKEN-GABES a amplement atteint ses objectifs
immediats, il a en effet permis de:
- eviter la rupture de gaz sur les zones industrielles de GABES en comblant la
baisse de disponibilitW du gaz d'EL BORMA.
- rendre disponible pour un fonctionnement de base une puissance electrique de
130 MW en turbines 'a combustion qui etaient a P'arret pour manque de gaz.
- convertir du G-asoil au gaz naturel la centrale turbine a combustion de SFAX
(40 MW).



- convertir du GPL au gaz naturel des industriels potentiels de ceramique sur le
trace du gazoduc.
- connecter les reseaux gaz Nord et Sud et permettre l'optimisation de leur
exploitation. t
Ce projet a, en outre, permis de:
- assurer l'6vacuation de la production gaz du gisement de MISKAR.
- ameliorer la part du gaz naturel dans l'energie primaire de 26 % en 1992 i
36 % en 1996.
- assurer, le transit journalier de 5 millions de m3 sur les 6,5 millions de m3 de
gaz consomme dans le pays.
VII - APPRECIATIONS ET CONCLUSIONS
La realisation du Gazoduc MSAKEN-GABES et de la boucle de Tunis s'est
deroulee convenablement tant sur les plans securite, qualite, coiit que delais:
Aucun incident n'a e signal, les essais et epreuves reglementaires ont et
concluants des les premiers contr8les, un controle scanner a confirm6, apres deux
annees d'exploitation, la bonne qualite de la fabrication des eqquipements et de la
construction de l'ouvrage, une reduction des cou'ts de plus de 20 % a e obtenue
et la mise en gaz a e  effectuee en decembre 1994, en harmonie avec les delais
prevus.
Les objectifs du projet ont e  largement atteints et en 1997, cette
infrastructure a assure 75 % du transit du gaz naturel consomm6 en Tunisie.
II est cependant 'a noter que, d'une part, ce d6veloppenient important de
l'infrastructure de 250 Km de r6seau haute pression, ayant interconnect6 deux
reseaux initialement separes et ayant mis en parallele diff6rentes sources
d'approvisionnement en gaz, n'a pas et sous-tendu par un systeme de
surveillance et de commande du nouveau reseau national gaz ainsi constitue.
Un centre de controle s'avere, a ce stade indispensable pour l'exploitation
et la gestion du reseau gaz et un projet dans ce sens a ete inscrit au IXeme Plan
de developpement 1997-2001.



D'autre part, I'etude de developpement du gaz en Tunisie, inscrite dans le
cadre de ce ptojet et menee conjointement avec SOFREGAZ (FRANCE), a
traite principalement des perspectives de developpement de la demande de gaz a
moyen et long termes et des infrastructures de transport de gaz s'y rapportant,
mais n'a pas sufflsamment analyse les aspects relatifs au developpement de la
distribution  du gaz et ceux lies 'a la tarification du gaz. Des actions
complementaires  doiventi etre  menees  dans ce sens pour combler ces
insuffisances.
Sur le plan financier et comparativement aux autres ressources de
financement, les conditions de la BIRD sont relativement plus on6reuses.
I1 est a signaler que les missions effectuees par la banque pour le suivi du
projet ont constitut une motivation supplementaire pour l'equipe de la STEG et
ont beaucoup contribue a la bonne execution du projet.
Aussi, nous tenons a exprimer nos remerciements a la BIRD, a la Division
< Groupe de developpement de l'infrastructure, bureau regional Moyen Orient et
Afrique du Nord >> et a tout le personnel qui a contribue 'a la re'ussite du projet.
