TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
INSTITUTO DE ACUEDUCTOS Y ALCANTARILLADOS NACIONALES
WITH TEE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF
PANAMA FOR A WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Instituto de Acuecluctos y Alcantarillados Nacionales (IDAAN) with the
guarantee of the Republic of Panama for the equivalent of US$1200 million to
help finance a water supply and sewerage project. The loan would have a term
of 20 years, including a 4-year grace period, with interest at 8-1/2 percent
per annum0
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic miEssion visited the country in September/October
1975. Its report, entitled "Updating Report on the Economy of Panamta"
(1066a-PAN),will be distributed shortly. Country data sheets are attached
as Annex I.
3.        In the 1960's, the Panamanian economy expanded rapidly with limited
Government participation and an efficient use of investment. World trade
flourished during that dEcade and Panama was able to benefit from its unique
geographic location owing to liberal trade legislation, free use of the United
States dollar as the domestic currency, and some limited investment of high
economic yield, such as the Colon Free Zone. The domestic market offered
opportunities for small-scale industrialization and there still was much
accessible virgin land that could be brought under production. The situation
changed in the present decade. There are fewer opportunities for import-
substitution. Further e-pansion of agriculture requires more capital and
specialized manpower, whether to improve yields and cropping patterns or to
extend the frontier to new, less accessible lands. The recession which is
affecting world trade has lowered the growth of the export-oriented service
sector. World inflation and high interest rates have been transmitted to the
open Panamanian economy, at a time when slackening aggregate demand made it
particularly difficult tc pass on to consumers the full cost increases. The
impact of these unfavorable developments was compounded by the end of a boom
in private construction cf high income housing and office buildings. The
rate of GDP growth, which. was on average 8 percent in 1959-1971, fell to
604 percent in 1972-73, to 3.5 percent in 1974, and to less than 2 percent
in 1975. Despite a rising level of public sector fixed investment (which
increased from 609 percent of GDP in 1968-72 to 9.1 percent in 1974) total
investment declined from 2609 percent of GDP to 25.8 percent during the same
period, as private investment fell from 20 to 1607 percent of GDPO Unemploy-
ment is estimated to have risen from 7 percent of the labor force in 1973
to 8.5 percent in mid-19750

4.        The Government has responded to the slackening of economic growth --
particularly serious because population is growing at the annual rate of 3 per-
cent -- by formulating a short-term program to reactivate the economy and a
longer term development strategy, embodied in the draft National Development
Plan, 1976-1980.
5.        The principal elements of the Government's short-term program
include (a) an export subsidy equivalent to 20 percent of value added for non-
traditional exports; (b) reduction in the interest rate charged on commercial
bank credit to agriculture and industry through a surcharge on loans for com-
merce and consumption; (c) a scheme to guarantee commercial bank mortgage loans
for low and middle-income housing and a facility to rediscount these loans
after eight years; (d) lowering of commercial bankst capital and reserve
requirements; (e) fiscal incentives to promote investment, including accelerated
depreciation, investment credits and income tax exoneration for reinvested cor-
porate profits; and (f) special income tax deductions for firms which increase
the number of low-income workers on their payrolls. In addition, the Government
has stepped up the pace of public investment in ongoing projects and in new
low-income housing programs, and the authorities have made efforts to create
a climate inducing private investment.
6.        The longer term strategy is aimed at increasing investment to main-
tain a satisfactory growth rate while, at the same time, bringing about an
improvement in the living standards of the population. This would be done by
developing service industries oriented towards world trade, thus capitalizing
on the country's strategic location; integrating the previously neglected rural
areas into the mainstream of Panama's development and making better use of the
country's natural resources,  The urban strategy of the Government centers on
improving infrastructure in the larger cities where most of the population ex-
pansion during the next decade is expected to take place. Panama, already a
heavily urbanized society, differs from other developing countries in that
urban economic activity has created employment for the bulk of the growing
labor force in the past, and is expected to continue to do so in the future.
7.        The Gov-qrnment has identified a nunher of' large projects in infra-
structure and in directly productive investmentC to take better advantage of
the counitry's potential for providing services to international trade --
including expansion of the successful industrial and commercial complex in the
Colon Free Zone - and to develop more intensively natuLral resources, including
minerals, hydroelectric potential, and agriculture. Although the Governlment
intends to carry out these investments directly, it estimates that its program
will also open up new opportunities for the private sector. The public invest-
ment progrwr, also aims at continuing a process of income redistribution through
the provision of better infrastructure facilities and social services to the
lower incorne groups and the adoption of measures to increase the productivity
of s!nall-scale farmers.
8.        There have already been significant accomplishments.  The
number of students in public schools increased by almost 60 percent bet-
ween 1967 and 1973. The largest gains were at the secondary level, where
enrollments increased by 80 percent. At the same time, there was sone improve-
ment in the student/teacher ratio.  The number of medicil and para-medical



- 3 -
personnel in official health care centers rose by about one-third in the same
period. The share of the population in the Social Security System rose from
under one-fifth in 1968 to about one-third in 1973.
9.        The Government has been able to carry out a substantial land reform
program while increasing, the production of basic grains. In the period 1969-
1975, the Government acqIuired some 440,000 hectares -- equivalent to one-fifth
of total land in farms -- and about 8,000 families were settled in 200 collective
farms and 300 cooperatives. The authorities raised support prices for basic
grains, expanded marketLng activities, and provided supervised credit for the
agrarian reform units. In 1974/75 the latter produced nearly 25,000 metric
tons of rice at an average yield of 42.4 cwt/ha, 20 percent higher than the
nationwide average. ThLs made it possible to end rice imports.
10.       The draft National Development Plan for 1976-80 gives emphasis to
projects that are directly productive and expected to be self-liquidating from
the financial and balance-of-payments points of view. This includes projects to
improve transport facilities across the isthmus of Panama (an oil pipeline, a
container port, and improvements of the trans-isthmic highway), a large open
pit copper mine at Cerrc, Colorado, three sugar mills with related field invest-
ments, a 6,000-ha agricultural project in the Bayano River basin, two hydro-
electric projects, a cerment factory and smaller projects for tourism, trans-
port, and urban developmlent. These projects, and the increase in private
investment which they are expected to bring about, could enable Panama to
return to sustained economic growtlh.
11.       The volume of public investment planned for the rest of the decade is
more than twice as large in constant terms as in the 1971-75 period, This
increase will require a much expanded managerial capacity which will put a strein
on the countryts professional resources. The authorities are aware of the con-
straint and have taken steps, such as establishing a large-scale student loan
and scholarship program, to attract qualified Panamanians living abroad and to
train local professionals. These measures may prove to be insufficient to meet
the demand for professional skills which the pace and diversity of the investment
program would require. The authorities have indicated that they intend to im-
plement the program with flexibility and to adapt the timing of individual
projects to the availability of resources, human as well as financial.
12.       With the major expansion in social and economic programs started in
1968, total public sector outlays have risen steadily. The authorities have
made efforts to raise the level of public sector savings in order to finance
these expanded programs. Following a disappointing outcome in 1972, when
the ratio of public savings to GDP fell to 1.4 percent, the ratio rose to
about 4 percent in 1974 and is estimated to have been higher in 1975. This
was achieved through the adoption of several new taxes, of improvements in
tax administration, and of measures to restrain the growth of current outlays.
Nonetheless, public savings have not kept pace with investment outlays, and the
Government has increasingly relied on external borrowing, much of it in the form
of commercial bank loans,, (In the case of Panama, practically all borrowing is
considered external owing to the use of the U.S. dollar for all transactions.)
As of December 1974, the disbursed external public debt reached US$472 million,
almost four times more than five years earlier, and equivalent to US$290 per



- 4 -
capita, one of the highest in the world.
13.       As a result of the high level of external public debt and the large
proportion of private bank credits (60 percent of total public debt in 1974),
debt service obligations of the public sector increased in 1968-74 at a faster
rate than public savings. (The conventional ratio of debt service to export
earnings is not meaningful as an indicator of creditworthiness in a country such
as Panama which uses the U.S. dollar as domestic currency.) This situation has
not led to serious difficulties as the Government has been readily able to re-
finance its commercial debt. However, the authorities plan to strengthen the
public sector's creditworthiness by ensuring that public savings will grow faster
than debt service obligations. They have indicated their intention to strengthen
the Central Government revenue structure to make it more responsive to economic
growth, to continue tightening tax administration and to allow public utility
agencies to follow price policies that would reduce their financial dependence
on the Central Government. These measures would be in line with the latest
stand-by arrangement approved by the IMF in November 1975.
14.       Panama is creditworthy for lending on conventional terms provided
that the authorities continue to take measures required to increase public sector
savings and implement. the public investment program with flexibility to ensure
that the growth of public debt obligations does not outstrip that of public
savings. In view of the high level and relatively unfavorable structure of the
public sector debt, Panama should make a special effort to obtain external
loans on as long as possible maturities0
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
15.       The Bank has to date made eleven loans to Panama totalling US$142.1
million. Of these, five loans for US$18.0 million, are fully disbursed (two
for roads totalling US$13.1 million; two for agriculture totalling US$0.9 mil-
lion, and one for power for US$4.0 million). Ongoing projects include a power
generation project for which the Bank lent US$42.0 million in 1970; an airport
project (Tocumen International Airport) for which the Bank lent US$20.0 million,
and a fisheries credit project for which the Bank lent US$3.4 million, both in
1971; a livestock credit project for which the Bank made a US$4.7 million loan
and a power transmission project for which the Bank made a US$30.0 million loan,
both in 1973. The most recent operation, a US$24.0 rnillion loan to finance the
construction of a fishing port, was approved in April 1975.   Execution of Bank-
finan-ced projects has been, on the whole, satisfactory, but substantial delays
and cost overruns have occurred particularly with respect to the airport and
power projects. Wh-.le the major causes of delay have been overcome, the cost
overruns have created financial problems in the case of IRHE, the power company.
The Government and IRHE have infonmed the Bank that tariff increases and other
financial measures are under active consideration.
16.       IFC has made one investment in Panama:  a commitment in 1971 to
acquire US$0.3 million of equity in the Corporacion de Desarrollo Hotelero S.A.
and to lend to the Corporation US$1.2 million to build a new international
hotel. This project was satisfactorily completed and the hotel was opened
to business. Annex II contains a Simwmary Statement of Bank loans and IXT



- 5 -
investments as of March 31, 1976, and notes on the execution of the ongoing
projects.
17.       Bank lending to Panama is designed to support the Government's
development strategy summarized in paragraph 6 above. This support is oriented
towards those sectors in which the Bank can make a special contribution in
terms of strengthening policies and institutions. Bank assistance is also
designed to remove bottlenecks to the Government's strategy of developing
Panama's dynamic service industries. The proposed Project is part of a com-
prehensive program to rehabilitate the Water Supply and Sewerage Institute's
finances and to provide adequate water services to priority areas around Colon
and Panama City. Free-trade and industrial estate projects are being carried
out in the former, while in the latter services would be extended to low-income
areas and to Punta Vacamonte, which is being developed with Bank assistance into
the focus for a modernized fishing industry. The Government has asked the Bank
to continue to support Panama's hydroelectric power expansion program, and its
fishing and livestock industries.
18.       The principal sources of external financing to Panama in the past
are summarized below:

1 Excluding a $0.6 million which was cancelled.
g Including a $60 million grant from the U.S. Government for
completion of the Darien Gap portion of the Pan-American Highway.
19o       Both AID and IDB have lent heavily for agriculture and for social
services. This pattern is likely to persist as the Government prefers borrowing
on highly concessionary terms for those sectors, while utilizing assistance
received on harder terms for projects which are expected to result in more
immediate economic benefits. The IDB is also lending for a program of



- 6 -
construction of secondary roads, and is considering assistance in cooperation
with the Bank to finance Panama's hydroelectric power expansion program.
20.       The Bankts share of Panama's publicly guaranteed external debt out-
standing and disbursed was 10.1 percent at the end of 1975 and the Bank's
share of public external debt service was 6.2 percent. Because of the high
levels of borrowing from commercial banks programmed by the Government, these
percentages are expected to drop by 1980 to 7.4 and 4.2 percent, respectively.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND SEWERAGE SECTOR IN PANAMA
Current Situation and Future Implications
21.       The distribution of the population has affected the development of
the water supply and sewerage sector in Panama. About half of Panama's 1.7
million people lived in cities and towns in 1974. Urban population is concen-
trated in the regions surrounding Panama City, the country's capital and
commercial center, and Colon, the industrial center, which are located on the
Pacific and Atlantic exits of the Panama Canal, respectively. About one-third
of the country's total population lives in Panama City alone. Outside Panama
City, Colon, and the surrounding towns, population is dispersed. The rate of
urbanization far exceeds the rate of population growth of 301 percent per year,
and the urban population, which totalled 813,000 in 1974, is expected to
increase to lol million by 1980.
22.       Considerable progress has been made in improving sanitation facilities
in Panama in the last 15 years, but these are still inadequate to meet the
needs of the rapidly growing population. Investments in water and sewerage
increased rapidly, particularly in the seventies, totalling US$44.1 million
in the 1971-74 period. These resulted in a substantial expansion in trans-
mission and distribution facilities, and in the installation of the Chilibre
Plant to supply Panama City, the first major government-owned production
facility. In the past, a large portion of the water distributed by the Insti-
tuto de Acueductos y Alcantarillados Nacionales (IDAAN), the national water
company, hau been purchased from the Panama Canal Company.
23.       The percentage of total population served by public water increased
from 48 percent in 1960 to 70 percent in 1974. In 1974, about 95 percent of
the urban population was served with water (mainly through house connections),
and about 45 percent of the rural population (communities of less than 2,000
inhabitants) had access to water, frequently in the form of standpipes. About
72 percent of the urban population was served by sewerage services, and about
1 percent of the rural population had access to sewerage services. The much
higher percentage of urban population with access to water and sewerage faci-
lities is explained partly by the extremely high unit costs of providing
water and sewerage services in the rural areas where population is dispersed,
and partly by the priority which must be given to tackling urban sanitation
problems where the health hazards resulting from inadequate sanitation faci-
lities are very high. Although the expansion of water supply and sewerage
systems in the urban centers has been rapid during the last 15 years, most of
the poor and rural migrants living in urban fringe areas still do not have
direct access to public waater.



- 7 -
24.       The Government's effort to improve sanitation facilities has been
costly. Sectoral planning, largely the responsibility of IDAAN, has been weak,
leading to overinvestment. At present, over-capacity in production co-exists
with unsatisfied demand. Production facilities designed to serve Panama City
and neighboring towns are underutilized because expansion in the distribution
network has not kept pace with increased capacity, with the result that the
poorer sections of the city and some surrounding towns have only 'Limited access
to water. On the other hand, expansion of capacity and distribution networks
in other parts of the ccuntry, such as the Colon area, have not kept pace with
increased demand. Further, the rapid expansion has led to production and supply
problems. Water losses in the networks and household wastage account for a high
percentage of water produced.  The full extent of the problem cannot be adequately
measured since over 40 percent of connections are not metered.  In 1975, about
36 percent of water produced could not be accounted for.
25.       The organizational structure and management systems of IDAAN were not
changed to meet the demands imposed on them by the expanded network. Largely
because water rates have not been adequately adjusted, IDAAN's financial via-
bility has been impaired1 and the contribution of funds provided from operations
to sectoral investments has been negligible.
Government Objectives
26.       The Panamanian Government is making efforts to correct problems
which have constrained the efficient development of the sector, and has prepared
a national sanitation program which has as an objective the provision of water
to at least 85 percent of the population by 1980. The program aims at installing
water supply systems in Dpoor urban areas to meet requirements resulting from
the inflow of rural migrants; increasing services in the rural areas, and
providing adequate service to the rapidly expanding industrial and commercial
sectors. Investments in water services will be geared not only to expanding
capacity and distribution, but also to optimizing the use of existing capacity,
27.       The national sanitation program also contemplates the extension of
sewerage systems, and the treatment of sewer and wastewaters in the metropolitan
areas of Panama City and Colon. So far, sewer and industrial liquid wastes
have been discharged untreated into the sea or adjacent rivers.
28.       To meet overal]. sectoral objectives, the Government proposes to
invest US$57 million over the next five years, of which IDAAN accounts for
US$54 million. Total investment is distributed as follows: US$20 mil.lion for
water supply in urban areas; US$10 million for sewerage in urban areas, and 13$?7
million for water supply and sewerage in provincial towns and rural areas.
29.       In carrying out. the investment program, which is realistic and
represents a substantial reduction of previous in'vestment plans, the Government
intends to impr6ove D)AAN's planning and to strengthen IDAAN's organization,
management and operations, with a view to making it a more eCfective agency
in project preparation and execution. Finally, the Government is addressing
water pricing issues, so that a reasonable proportion of new works can be
financed from water sales.



- 8 -
30.       The proposed Project, the first Bank operation in the water supply
and sewerage sector in Panama, supports the Government's objectives. It
would be aimed primarily at expanding distribution to the poor areas in four
of Panama's urban centers, and includes a substantial component of technical
assistance to strengthen the planning process and improve the organization
and management of IDAAN. External assistance for the sector began in the
early 1960's, and US$53 million have been committed by international lending
institutions since then. USAID has been particularly active in the sector.
It has made five loans totalling US$37 million, but does not plan any further
water supply lending. The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) has made
three loans totalling US$1307 million for water supply projects in provincial
towns and the rural areas, and intends to continue to concentrate its sector
lending in the smaller cities and rural areas.
Institutional Situation
31.       IDAAN, the national water supply and sewerage authority, was estab-
lished in 1961 as an autonomous government agency. It carries out about 95
percent of annual investments in the sector, operates a network of 50 water
supply and 14 sewerage systems throughout Panama, and has responsibility for
planning and operating water and sewerage systems in communities with more
than 500 inhabitants. The Ministry of Public Health plans and operates the
systems in the rest of the country. This structure is adequate for Panama
which has few large urban centers, and where cross-subsidization is needed to
make a project in smlall communities and the rural areas financially viable.
32.       IDAAN is headed by an Executive Director who is appointed by the
President of Panama. A seven-man Board of Directors provides policy guidelines,
and makes major operating decisions. IDAAN's management and staff are compe-
tent. However, the expansion of services resulting from large investment
programs in the past has taxed its organizational and financial structure,
which is characterized by (i) overstaffing, (ii) overlapping of responsibi-
lities, (iii) inadequate billing and collection procedures, (iv) improper
accounting and reporting practices, and (v) inadequate planning and budgeting.
33.       The Government and IDAAN recognize that IDAAN's organization,
management systems and operating procedures will have to be strengthened to
meet the needs of the rapidly expanding sector. Specifically, IDAAN's
management recognizes that the Planning Office should be strengthened so that
information on sectoral requirements and their financial implications is always
available for decision-making. Measures will also be taken to reduce over-
staffing by stabilizing the number of IDAAN's employees. IDAAN has agreed to
revise its organizational structure and strengthen its Planning Office within
one year of loan signing (draft Loan Agreement, Section 3.04). Further,
IDAAN staff will require additional training in project evaluation, auditing,
and technical fields which are new to IDAAN. To meet the operational and
training needs, the proposed Project includes financing for consultant ser-
vices to help design and implement appropriate management systems, and a
training program to upgrade the internal audit, financial, administrative,
and technical staff. IDAAN has agreed to carry out the management assistance
and training programs with consultants acceptable to the Bank alid to review
the progress of these programs with the Bank (draft Loan Agreement, Sections
3.02(b) and 3.03).



PART IV - THE PROJECT
34.       The proposed Project would be the Bank's first operation in the
water supply and sewerage sector in Panama. Technical and economic studies for
the Project were carried out by IDAAN with the assistance of consultants, and
the Project was appraised by a Bank mission which visited Panama in November
1975. Negotiations for the proposed loan were held in Washington from April 19
to April 22, 1976. The Borrower, IDAAN, and the Guarantor, the Republic of
Panama, were represented by Messrs. Manuel Alvarado, Executive Director of
IDAAN, and Joae Sokol, Deputy Minister of Planning and Economic Policy. A
report entitled "Panama Staff Projeot Report on the Panama Water Supply and
Sewerage Project" (1048a-PAN), dated May 14, 1976, is being distributed
separately.
Project Concept
35.       The Project involves improvements in the water supply systems of the
cities of Panama, Colon, Chorrera, and Arraijan, and provision of water to the
new fishing port of Vacainonte. It would also contribute to bring about insti-
tutional and operational improvements in the sector. The Project would (i) pro-
vide water to about 1061,000 of the poorest people living in Panama City and
suburbs of Colon by expanlding the distribution systems to low income areas of
those cities; (ii) increase the production and transmission capacity of the Colon
water sw2ply system by onie-third and rehabilitate its existing distribution
system; (iii) provide adequate water supply to the low-income towns of Chorrera
and Arraijan, near Panama City; (iv) supply water to the fishing port of
Vacamonte; (v) reduce waste and losses in the existing systems so that un-
accounted-for water does not exceed 25 percent of production, which is consi-
dered an acceptable level; (vi) improve the sewerage system in Panama City's
low-income district of El. Chorillo; and (vii) improve the efficiency of IDAAN's
management and operations.
36.       The physical components of the Project are designed to permit phased
expansion in capacity as demand increases. Specifically, the Project consists
of:
I. Colon Sub-Froject
Construction of a raw water intake and pumping facilities
on the Gatun Lake; installation of a 1 km long raw water
transmission pipeline to transport water from the intake
well at the Gatun Lake to the Colon treatment plant; and
construction of the Colon water treatment plant with an
initial capacity of 4 mgd.
Installation of a 2 ka long filtered water transmission
pipeline to convey treated water by gravity from the
Colon water plant to Colon and its suburbs;
Installation of distribution facilities in the low- income
suburban districts of Cativa, Puerto Pilon, and Sabanita,
where 76,001) low-income people live;



- 10-
Rehabilitation and reinforcement of the existing distri-
bution system, establishment of a leak detection and repair
program, pitometric investigations to locate leaks in the
system, installation of house water meters, and construction
of system reinforcements.
II. Panama City Sub-Project
Installation of water pipes and sewers in the district of El
Chorrillo, where 30,000 low-income people live.
III. Chorrera Sub-Project
Optimization of the water treatment plant to increase its
present capacity of 3 mgd to 6 mgd;
Improvement of Chorrera's distribution facilities, including
the reinforcement of transmission pipelines and the provision
of additional storage.
IV. Arraijan/Vacamonte Sub-Project
Increase the supply of water to the town of Arraijan and provide
water to the fishing port of Vacamonte by either installing wells or
by linking the Arraijan system to the Miraflores Plant in the
Panama Canal Zone.
V. Metering Program
Purchase and installation of 30,000 water meters, and meter
boxes to be installed in all IDAAN systems.
Acquisition and utilization of water meter testing and leak
detection equipment.
VI. Technical Assistance
Management consulting services to assist IDAAN in the following
specific areas: (i) definition of functions of each department;
(ii) design and implementation of a program to strengthen the
Planning Office; (iii) design and implementation of an effective
billing and collection system; (iv) improvement of accounting
practices and procedures; (v) development of computer-based
accounting and reporting systems; (vi) design of an audit prog-
ram; and (vii) preparation of effective planning and budgeting
systems;
Consulting services to train IDAAN staff in the following
fields: (i) administration; (ii) project evaluation (technical,
financial, and economic); (iii) auditing; and (iv) technical -
including treatment plant operations, leakage detection, and
pitometric surveys.

VII. Engineering services for detailed design and constraction
supervision.
37.       Gatun Lake, which will be the source of water for the Colon Sub-
Project, is located in the Panama Canal Zone and is under United States juris-
diction. IDAAN has requested a license from the Panama Canal Zone Authorities
to locate an intake and pumping equipment on the shore of the lake, and to use
lake water for supply of Colon. IDAAN is confident that such a license can be
expeditiously obtained. The same procedure was followed in the case of the
Chilibre treatment plant, which supplies Panama with water pumped from Lake
Madden, also under United States jurisdiction. Obtaining a license would be
a condition of disbursement for the Colon Sub-Project (draft Loan Agreement,
Schedule 1, paragraph 4(b).
38.      IDAAN would carry out studies to determine whether it should use
groundwater or pump water from the Miraflores water treatment plant in the
Panama Canal Zone to supply Arraijan and Vacamonte (draft Loan Agreement,
Section 3.05). To pump wiater from Miraflores, it would be necessary to use
an existing pipeline or pipelines in the Canal Zone. If this proves to be
the best alternative, IDAAN would request a license to use the pipeline or
pipelines. Under this alternative, obtaining such a license would be a con-
dition of disbursement for this Sub-Project (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 1,
paragraph 4(c).
Project Cost and Financirl
39.       The estimated cost of the Project is US$20.5 million, including
(i) 14 percent of base costs for physical contingencies; (ii) 36 percent of
base costs for price escalation; and (iii) capitalized interest anci other
charges during construction. The cost estimates are summarized below:

40.       Foreign exchange requirements amount to US$12.0 million, including
US$2.1 million of interest during construction, and the Bank loan would finance
this amount. The Bank loan would have a term of 20 years, including four years
of grace.  The balance of Project costs, estimated at US$8.5 million, would be
financed by IDAAN from internal cash generation (US$4.5 million) and by govern-
ment capital contributions (US$4.0 million). The Government has undertaken to
provide the necessary funds for the Project (draft Guarante Agreement, Section
2.02).
41.       The Project contains an estimated 390 man-months of consulting ser-
vices to assist in the preparation of engineering drawingsand specifications;
project supervision and management assistance and training. The estimated
cost of these services is US$2 million, or an average cost per man-month of
US$5,120 (including physical contingencies and price escalation).
Market and Production Aspects
42.       Water consumption is expected to increase at an average annual rate
of 2.0 percent for Panama City; 0.8 percent for Colon; and 8.3 percent for
the rest of the country. The projections take into account increases in
overall demand resulting from the expected population growth and reduction
in wastage resulting from the combined effect of the metering program and
tariff increases. The per capita consumption in Colon has been conservatively
estimated in that it does not take into account some of the demand that could
result from the industrialization of the city.  The Project, however, has
been designed so that the proposed facilities could be upgraded at any time
to satisfy additional requirements.
43.       Water for the Panama City Sub-Project would come from the Governrent-
owned Chilibre plant on Madden Lake and from the Miraflores plant in the Panama
Canal Zone which currently supplies about 53 percent of the capital's require-
ments. Water for the Colon Sub-Project would come from Gatun Lake and from
the Mount Hope plant in the Panama Canal Zone which is currently Colon's sole
source. Chorrera's treatment plant uses water from the Caimito River, while
water for Arraijan/Vacamonte would come from underground sources or from the
Miraflores plant.
Implementation
h4.       The Project would be carried out by IDAAN.  Engineering consultants
acceptable to the Bank would prepare the detailed design of the Project, and
would assist IDAAN in the supervision of construction. The Project would be
carried out during 1976-80.
Procurement and Disbursement
45.       All contracts would be awarded through international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines, except for civil works contracts
under US$100,000, and totalling not more than US$1.3 million, which would
be awarded on the basis of local bidding procedures satisfactory to the Bank.
Foreign contractors are expected to win all contracts for plant and pumping
station equipment, water meters and pipes. Panarnpnian contractors are
expected to win all civil works contracts except those for the water treat-
ment plants. For bid evaluation purposes, a 15 percent margin of preference



- 13 -
(custom duties are substantially higher) would be allowed for equipment
manufactured in Panama.
46.       The loan would be disbursed over a four-year period against the
estimated imported component of the Project.   Disbursements would be made
against the CIF cost of imported equipment, 13 percent of civil works, which
represents the imported. component of such works, and the foreign cost of
consulting services. The loan is expected to be fully disbursed by the second
half of 1980.
Financial Analysis
47.       Water rates rerained constant for 20 years.   This was possible
because the Governrr.ent was prepared to cover IDAAN's recurrent losses, and
because until 1975, when the Chilibre water treatment plant was cord.,ssioned,
all water for distribution in the metropolitan areas of Panarna City and
Colon was purchased from the Panama Canal Company at low costs.   The higher
than anticipated operating costs. together with the funds required to finance
recent investments, resulted ir. operating losses for IDAANI from 1972 tc 197h.
The financial situation was further aggravated by a high level of overdue
water bills, of which the major part was owed by public sector agencies.    In
1975, the Government finally authorized a substantial water rate increase
which, together with measures to improve billing and collection practices,
allowed IDAAN to obtain a net profit of US$3.5 million.
48.       Additional. measures are still required for IDAAN to:  (a) liquidate
a US5 nmillion overhang of current liabilities, and (b) raiEe the large capital
sums needed for its investment program. The Governnent and IDAANi have agreed
on a major financial package whose mair cormponents are:  (i) refinancing IDAAN's
short-tern debt through a US$2 million mediun-term coimnercial bank loan which
was recently contracted; (ii) settlement by the end of 1977 of overdue public
sector water bills (draft Guarantee Agreement, Section 3.02); (iii) phased
increase of water rates which would almost double their 1975 level by end of
1978 (draft; Loan Agreement, Section 5.C5).
49.       The Government has already authorized IDAAN tc further increase the
water tariffs beginning March 31, 1976, on the basis of autoriatic rmorithly
increases of 3 percent per month for 12 consecutive months, and of 1.5 percent
per month for 12 consecutive ronths thereafter.   The net effect in current
prices of the monthly automatic increases would be to raise the average annual
tariffs by 16 percent in 1976, 30 percent in 1977 and 14 percent in 197&. The
average rate, including valorization tax, was US$0.65 per thousand U.S. gallons
at the end of 1975, and will graduallv increase to US$1.03 by the end of 1978.
This is hieh both by Latin American and United States standards.
50.       After 1978,-water rates would be adjusted as necessary to ensure
that funds from internal. sources are not less than 3.8 percent of the average
current net value of its fixed assets in service and under construction during
any fiscal year (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.06). This target wi:il generate
enough funds so that IDJAN will be able to cover operating costs an(d a substan-
tial portion of its investment program.   In addition to water rates, IDAAN wi]l



continue to charge a valorization tax to cover investment in distribution
facilities (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.08).   These measures should
enable IDAAN to obtain a financial rate of return on revalued fimed assets
of about 4 percent after 1976. IDAAN intends to carry out annual revaluation
of its fixed assets (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.04). A rate of return
of h percent is considered adequate for a company of this type. IDAAN, in
additi.on to being responsible for water supply, also provides sewerage ser-
vices. Mixed companies of this type generally have lower levels of profit-
ability than water companies. Also, unlike other water utilities which only
onerate in one city, IDAAN runs 50 water supply and l1 sewer systems in rural
as well as urban areas. These systems, particularly those in scattered rural
communities, have a high social component.   The Goverrment and IDAAN have also
decided to carry out a study of the water tariff structure to assess the
impact of its rate structure on the different income levels of IDAAN's cus-
tomers (draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.09).
51.        DAA Its capital requirements during 1976-80 total US$54.1 mil]ion,
including the proposed Project of US$20.5 million, and additional construction
of US$33.6 milli.on. About 38 percent of the requirements would be financed
from net funds provided by operations; 19 percent from government equity con-
tributions; 43 percent from borrowings. The borrowings include the proposed
US$12 million Bank loan and a loan estimated at US$12 million from the IDB.
The IDB loan is estimated to have an interest rate of 3 percent per annum, with
an amortization period of 30 years, including a 4-year grace period. The
financing plan is summarized in the following table:

52.       II)AAN would not undertake any other major investment during the
period of execution of the proposed Project without the approval of the Bank
(draft Loan Agreement, Section 5.10) nor would it incur any long-terni debt
without the Bank's agreement unless its projected net income before interest
and depreciation is at least 1.4 times its maximnlm debt service (draft Loan
Agreement, Section 5.07). IDAAN's financial statements will be audited
annually by independent external. auditors (draft Loan Agreements Section 5.02).
53.       The financial structure and liquid position of IDAAN will] improve
substantially over the next five years (1976-8o). Total assets will increase
by about 56 percent to about US$194 million; equity will almost double, from
US$68 million to US$123 million, while long-term debt will increase by about
31 percent, from US$413 million to Us$63 million. The debt/equity ratio will
continue to improve and by 1980 will be about 1 to 2. The ratio of current
assets to current liabilities will be favorable throughout the period, and will
average about 2 to 1. IDAAN would settle all outstanding overdue bills to
other public sector agrencies by the end of 1977 (draft Loan Agreement, Section
5 .11).
Economic Analysis
54.       The internal] financial rate of return is estirnated to be 7 percent
for the Colon Sub-Pro`lect, the cost of which is US$6.3 million; 26 percent for
the Panama Sub-Project, the cost of which is US$2.2 million; 9 percent for the
Chorrera Sub-Project, the cost of which is US$3.1 million; and 6 percent for
the Arraijan Sub-Project, the cost of which is US$0.5 million. The average
internal financial rat.e of return of these components, which account for 66
percent of the total Froject cost, is 11 percent.
55.       The aggregate rate of return exc]-udes the following con!ponents,
for which no meaningful rate of return could be estimated because of the
predoirinance of non-quantifiable factors: (i) improving services for exist-
ing consumers, the cost of which is US$33.9 mill.ion; (ii) management and
training, the cost of which is US$0.5 million; and (iii) extending services
to the fishing port of Vacarnonte, the cost of which is US$1.4 mii.3ion. The
Vacamonte Sub-Project is fully justified, since the provision of adequate
volures of water is inclispensible for the functioning of the fishing industry
in the new site.
Risks
56.       There are no major technical, financial or marketing risks to the
success of the proposed Project. IDAAN has had previous experience in carry-
ing out investments in treatment plants and distribution systems. Existing
and prospective arrangements with the Panama Canal Zone Authorities ensure
ample water supply, boTh from Lakes Madden and Gatun, and through purchases
from plants located in the Parama Canal Zone whose capacity exceeds prospec-
tive Zone consurption. In order to locate a water intake on the shores of
the Gatun Lake and to use water of the Gatun Lake, IDAAN would have to obtain
a license from the Panama Canal Zone Authorities.   IDAAN may also have to



- 16 -
obtain a license to use a pipeline or pipelines in the Canal Zone to pump
water from the Miraflores water treatment plant to Arraijan. IDAAN is con-
fident that such licenses can be expeditiously obtained. Although the
Governor of the Zone can only grant revocable licenses, the likelihood of a
license being revoked is negligible. The water supply systems of Panama
City and Colon have traditionally been developed taking into account the
availabilities in the Panama Canal Zone, and indeed, until 1975, facilities
in the Zone were the sole source of water for the two cities.
57.       As indicated in paragraphs 32 and 33 above, the rapid expansion
of IDAAN's services has taxed its organizational and financial structure.
However, DAAN has undertaken to strengthen its organizational structure,
management procedures and to train its staff, with the assistance of quali-
fied consultants. This will enable IDAAN to carry out its 1976-80 program
successfully. In addition, the Goveinment has adopted a water rate policy
designed to reverse IDAAN's previous financial deterioration.   An improvement;
in financial performance began in 1975, when IDAAN had its first net profit
since 1972.
Conclusions
56.       The proposed Project would fulfill several objectives.   It would
provide water to low-income population in key urban cent;ers. Secondly, it
would increase the supply of water in Colon, supporting the Government's
industrialization policy for the city. Thirdly, it would assist in imprcving
sectora] planning by providirig assistance in this field. Fourthly, it would
strengthen project execution and financing in the sector by imiproving the
operating and managerial capacity of IDAAN, as well as ensuring its financial
viability.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
59.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Instituto de
Acueductos y Alcantarillados Nacionales, the draft Guarantee Agreement
between the Republic of Panama and the Bank, the Report of the Committee
provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement and
the text of a draft resclution approving the proposed loan are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately. Special conditions of the
Project are listed in Section III of Anex IV. There are two conditions of
diEbursement, namely, that (a) no disbursements will be made on the Colon
Sub-Pro,ject until IDAAN has obtained from the Panama Canal Company the neces-
sary license to locate the water intake on the Gatun Lake and use water from
the Gatun Lake (draft Loan Agreement, Schedule 1, paragraph 4(c); and (b) if
studies indicate that the most appropriate alternative for the supply of
water to Arraijan and Vacaronte is pumping water from the Miraflores water
treatment plant, no disbursements will be made for the Arraijan/Vacamonte
Sub-Project unJess IDAAN has obtained the necessary license to use any pipe-
line or pipelines required for purposes of this Sub-ProJect (draft Loan
Agreement, Schedule 1, paragraph b(c).

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION-
Loan No. 661: Second Power Projecti_US$42 Million Loan of March 16, 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1977
The Project is about 84 percent completed with an expected 18-month
delay for the major component, the Bayano hydroelectric plant, which will not
reach full output before the third quarter of 1976. The other major components,
Las Minas 40 MW unit and associated transmission, have been commissioned. The
project cost is now estimated at US$96.6 million or 66 percent above appraisal
estimates. Delays in project execution resulted from shortage of materials
and difficulties with the contractor. The cost overruns are due mainly to
larger than forecast inflation and project execution period, and construction
errors. Discussions are in progress with the Government and IRHE on cost over-
run financing and tariff adjustments to increase revenues.
Loan No. 783: Tocumen International Airport Project; US$20 Million Loan of
Auu     2l j1971 l Closi_ng Date:  December 31, 1977
The Project is about 18 months behind schedule and it has had a
100 percent cost overrun. Delays in project execution have resulted in large
part from changes in design and bad weather conditions at the beginning of
construction which made earthworks difficult to execute. The overrun is due to
delays in project execution and inflation. Runway paving and the construction
of the terminal building are progressing satisfactorily and the loan should be
fully disbursed by the new Closing Date of December 1977. The financial posi-
tion of the borrower continues to be strong in spite of the worldwide slowdown
in international air transportation. The shortfall in the project financing
plan, caused by cost increases, will be covered by additional governnent equity
funds.
Loan No. 78h:  Fisheries Project; US$3.4 Ivillion Loan of August 2, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1976
The Project, which is designed to increase efficiency of the Panamanian
shrimp industry, consists of (1) construction of shrimp trawlers; (2) a trawler
captain's training program; and (3) a fishing port feasibility study. The
captain's training program is expected to be completed by the end of July 1976.
The fishina port feasibility study was completed in February 197h, and led to
the preparation of a project for which the Executive Directors approved a loan
in April 1975. Construction of trawlers is almost completed with most urawlers
already in service; however, the scope of the Project had to be reduced from the
/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balance evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

originally intended 40 trawlers to 26 trawlers due to escalation of costs.
As of March 31, 1976, the funds under the loan were 90 percent disbursed.
Loan No. 901: Livestock Development Project; US$4.7 Million Loan of June 8,
1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The Project finances cattle enterprises, including land reform
settlements involved in dairying, and beef breeding and fattening; and the
provision of technical services, including an ongoing study of the livestock
potential in the Atlantic Coast Region. As of December 31, 1975, the loan
was 44 percent disbursed, and should be fully disbursed on schedule.
Loan No. 948: Third Power Project; US$30 Million Loan of December 4, 1973:
Closing Date: June 3Q, 1978
The Project is designed to integrate three of the four isolated major
regional electricity systems into a national grid. Project implementation is about
10 months behind schedule because of delay in engineering, bidding, and procurement
of major items -- the 28 MW diesels, 230 kv lines, and substations. Cost over-
run is currently estimated at 25 percent, in large part due to inflation.
Loan No. 1114: Fishing Port Project; US$24 Million Loan of May 27, 1915;
Closing Date: September 30, 1979
The consultants are completing the final engineering of the port.
Prequalification of biddLers is complete and tender documents are being prepared.
The Government expects to have the access road ready by mid-1976.

Procurement:         All contracts will be awarded through international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines,
except for civil works contracts under US$100,000 and
totalling not more than US$1.3 million which will be
awarded in accordance with local bidding procedures which
are satisfactory to the Bank. Foreign contractors are
expected to win all contracts for plant and pumping
station equipment, water meters, and pipes. Panamanian
contractors are expected to win all civil works contracts,
except those for the water treatment plants.
Rate of Return:      The internal financial rate of return for those items of
the Project for which it was possible to quantify benefits
and which account for 66 percent of total Project costs,
is 11.0 percent. The return for the individual Sub-
Projects is as follows: Colon, 7.3 percent; Panama City,
26.4; Chorrera, 8.6 percent; and Arraijan, 5.9 percent.
The financial rates of return are lower than the expected
economic returns because intangible benefits such as
improvement of the environment and public health are not
fully reflected in the prices charged for water services.
Consultants:         Suitably qualified consultants to:    (a) design and imple-
ment management systems appropriate to the functions of
the Borrower: (b) train the Borrower's staff; (c) carry
out the final design of the Project and supervise con-
struction.
