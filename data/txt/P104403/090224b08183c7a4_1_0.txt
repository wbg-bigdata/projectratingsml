                         The objective for the $6.25 million in GPOBA funds is to support the Lesotho Public-Private Partnership for the national referral hospital by expanding the number and
                         types of key services available to patients and acting as a top-up payment to allow additional volume for critical services.

                         Implementation Status Overview
                         The Government of Lesotho (GOL) public-private partnership (PPP) for the design and construction of the new hospital, the renovation of three filter clinics, and the management of
                         facilities, equipment, and delivery of services is enshrined in the PPP Agreement which covers 18 years. However, the projected costs of the PPP exceeded the anticipated operating
                         expenses for the hospital and clinics and required additional payment by GOL. The GPOBA Grant ($6.25 million) was intended as a reimbursement-based financing mechanism to
                         help the GOL meet some of the financing gap in the initial years of the PPP Agreement. It is allocated as US$3.44 million in partial subsidy for the services rendered at the filter
                         clinics and US$2.81 million in partial subsidy for services at the hospital.

                         The overall PPP implementation continues to be impressive in terms of service outputs and quality. Since opening on October 1, 2011, the Queen Mamohato Memorial Hospital
                         (QMM) has consistently exceeded its key targets for monthly inpatients volume. Year-to-Date (YTD) in-patient admission numbers from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2012
                         exceeded the annual admission target under the PPP Agreement by approximately 47% (24,247 compared to the target of 16,500). Similarly during the same period, the total
                         number of outpatient visits to both the hospital, gateway clinic (adjacent to the hospital) and three filter clinics exceeded the target by approximately 42% (404,400 compared to the

                         annual target of 285,500). Of the 404,400, 269,133 represented the YTD number of outpatient visits to the filter clinics alone. In terms of service quality based on patient and family
                         satisfaction surveys during the same period, QMM consistently exceeded the quarterly target of 75% at an average of 85% each month while the monthly average for the three filter
                         clinics was 80%.

                         Impressive results under the overall PPP project are also reflected in other areas. The facilities are providing an expanded range of services compared to the older referral hospital,
                         Queen Elizabeth II. These expanded services include: dentistry, optometry and X-ray services, Lesotho’s first intensive care unit and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), 9 operating
                         theatres compared to the 2 that QEII had, and a broader set of medical equipment such as CT and MRI machines, laryngoscopes and endoscopy equipment, as well as extended
                         maternity services at the filter clinic level*. The filter clinics provide 24-hour maternity services including EmONC which are expanding access to assisted deliveries while complicated
                         cases are referred to QMM which has better capacity to handle these cases.
                         With the introduction of newer and better equipment together with service standards and performance measures, the diagnostic and treatment capabilities of QMM and the filter
                         clinics are significantly improved. For example, the latest equipment within the NICU are helping to improve the survival of low birth-weight babies while the availability of a complete
                         picture and archiving system (PACS) for radiology images and test results provides improved and faster access to laboratory results and allows clinicians to develop more precise
                         treatments and reduce the mortality of non-infectious patients. A project endline survey (results expected in April 2013) will provide more concrete quantitative and qualitative data to
                         demonstrate these improvements.

                         Furthermore, the QMM network exercises efficient use of limited resources by establishing a clear referral system between the filter clinics, gateway clinic and the hospital,
                         streamlining and encouraging redistribution in the procurement system to minimize stock-outs, and managing human resources (HR) efficiently to meet specific demands at each
                         facility throughout the network. Tsepong has invested heavily in upgrading the skill level of the healthcare workers by providing training and certification programs, including but not
                         limited to: Basic Life Support, Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support and Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and is establishing clear performance criteria to improve and maintain
                         service quality. Moreover, Tsepong adopted an HR management standard at the QMM that includes an individual performance management mechanism to incentivize staff , a better
                         work environment, a new work culture and norms which has led to improved patient outcomes and employee satisfaction. These important improvements are also driven by key
                         aspects of the PPP contract with the Government of Lesotho which are focused on sustainability and impact beyond the life of the PPP agreement. For example, Tsepong agreed to
                         develop a major clinical teaching site by collaborating with the National Health Training College of Lesotho to develop a training program for physicians, nurses and other health
                         professionals.

                         * Prior to PPP, Mabote and Qaolin g clinics provided dentistry and maternity services while Likotsi did not provide these services including maternity.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         Following a one year extension, the project will close on December 31, 2012. At the conclusion of the GPOBA funding, it is intended that the Government will assume 100% funding
                         of the services at the hospital and all filter clinics. IFC will continue to support the Government (MOH and Ministry of Finance) with an implementation support program that includes
                         contract management and capacity building in public relations for the PPP.
