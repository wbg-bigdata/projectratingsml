                         11,677 where the annual target is 16,500.

                         The three filter clinics continue to function well and are providing quality healthcare to more patients than anticipated and the PPP contract required. While the per annum target for

                         operation in December 2011.

                         The project has been extended for an additional year until December 31, 2012. The one year extension will enable Tsepong to regain valuable time lost for service provision due to
