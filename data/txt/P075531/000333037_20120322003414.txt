A. SUMMARY

1.      The AusAid Trust Fund Grant Agreement (TF096084) co-financing the REP I
(Grant Agreement) will be amended to (i) extend the closing date from March 31, 2012
to July 31, 2012 to allow sufficient time for final delivery of solar home systems; (ii)
align the AusAID Grant Agreement with the approved Project Paper for the AusAID co-
financing dated June 18, 2010 to allow disbursements for the Power to the Poor (P2P)
program under the EDL grid extension component; and (iii) reallocate funds between the
on-grid component implemented by Electricité du Laos (EdL) and the off-grid
component implemented by the Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM).

B. PROJECT STATUS

2.      Progress toward meeting the project’s development objectives is satisfactory. To
date, the project has increased access to electricity to approximately 65,900 households
against a revised end-of-project target of 65,000 households. Although the number of
off-grid households having received electricity has fallen short of the target (8,858 vs.
10,000), this was more than made up for by the success of EDL’s on-grid electrification
expansion program and largely through the innovative Power to the Poor (P2P) program.
The total number of households with on-grid connections is just over 57,000, of which
more than one-third has been achieved under P2P.

3.      The second objective of improving the financial sustainability of the power sector
have been largely met in terms of (i) dramatic improvement in overall system losses
which decreased from about 22% in 2005 to 10.45% as of October 2011 (against an end-
of-project target of 17%) and (ii) the establishment of a demand side management and
energy efficiency (DSM/EE) unit with EDL and audits of 50 central government
agencies. The financial targets for EDL have been met up to FY09 although the financial
position of EDL deteriorated significantly in FY10 and FY11. However, the Government
recently approved a significant tariff increase for EdL which will help rectify its financial
position going forward.

4.    There are no overdue audit reports. The latest audit reports were submitted with
some delays, but the audit opinions were unqualified.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES

o Disbursement arrangements. The Grant Agreement will be aligned with the Project
  Paper dated June 18, 2010 to include an additional eligible expenditure for sub-grants
  under disbursement category (1). Although disbursements for the P2P scheme were
  envisaged in the Project Paper for the AusAID co-financing, the Grant Agreement
  inadvertently maintained the original REP I categories of expenditures.

o Reallocations. The proposed reallocation is necessary to absorb unutilized funds of
  about USD 280,000 for Power to the Poor under the grid extension component (A.1).
  This amount was originally intended to finance micro hydro projects, but there were
  unforeseen delays which prevented this from being implemented under REP I.

    Closing Date. The closing date will be extended by four months from March 31,
     2012 until July 31, 2012. The proposed extension is necessary to allow sufficient
     time to ensure final delivery under the solar home system goods contract and
     completion of the consulting contract on “Detailed Project Reports on Development
     and Replication of Biogas Power Generation at Large Pig Farms.? The closing dates
     for the IDA and GEF Grant Agreements were extended by two years to March 31,
     2012. These grants will close on time. This will be the first extension for the
     AusAID Grant. The PDO remains relevant and achievable.

                                           4
   Others (Amendment to Project Description). The legal description of the EdL project
    component for grid extension (Schedule 1, Part A.1) will need to be amended to
    reflect the P2P program along with appropriate definition for sub-grants. A sub-grant
    will be defined as “a sub-grant made available by EdL to support installation of in-
    house wiring for electricity supply for targeted poor households in accordance with
    the “Lao PDR Rural Electrification Program House Wiring Assistance Program
    Manual.? The implementation arrangements for the P2P program have already been
    appraised and approved as part of additional financing and is being regularly reported
    on during implementation support missions.

   In addition, the legal description of the MEM project component for alternative rural
    electrification technologies and delivery models (Schedule 1, Part B.3.b) will need to
    be amended to read “biogas? as opposed to “biomass? to reflect the changes in the
    Project Paper for the AusAID Grant (dated June 18, 2010) vis-à-vis the original
    project description.

   In line with the closing date extension above, it is proposed that the due date for the
    Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for REP I be extended by four months.
    Therefore, the revised ICR submission date is January 31, 2013.
