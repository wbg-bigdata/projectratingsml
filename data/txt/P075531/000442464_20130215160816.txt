F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)

The objectives of REP I Project are to: (i) increase access to electricity of rural households in
villages of targeted provinces; and (ii) improve financial performance of the power sector.
The PDO set forth in the Development Grant Agreement dated June 2, 2006 was different from
the PDO from the PAD and reads as “the objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient to
implement, in the Project Provinces, Phase I of the Program which is designed to improve the
living standards and increase the income of rural households by providing access to electricity.?
This is of higher level and not consistent with key performance indicators defined in the PAD. In
addition, the PDO set forth in the PAD, the Project Paper for AusAID additional financing and
the Development Grant Agreement of REP II is the same as that in the PAD of REP I. For these
reasons, the evaluation of this ICR uses the PAD version as the reference point.
Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
Global Environment Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
Global environment objectives are: (i) substantial adoption of off-grid renewable energy in
Government's rural electrification program; and (ii) increased efficiency of energy supply by EdL
and consumption by customers, resulting in greenhouse gas emission reductions as increased
hydropower exports substitute for thermal power production in Thailand.

1. Project Context, Development and Global Environment Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Country and Economy Background. With a population estimated at 5.7 million in 2004, and growing at
a relatively rapid rate of 2.6 percent annually, Lao People’ Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) was
characterized by a rich cultural and ethnic diversity where almost half of the population belonged to
minority groups concentrated in the upland areas. A large majority of the population relied for its
livelihood on agriculture, which accounted for over half of GDP. Gross National Income per capita stood
at around US$340 in 2004. Urbanization was relatively low, at 25 percent. The economy had been
growing at an average annual rate of 6.5 percent since 2001, driven mostly by increased foreign direct
investment in the hydro and mining sectors. Sustained economic growth has enabled significant and
steady decline in poverty rates, from 46 percent in 1992-93 to 27 percent in 2007-08.
Rural Electrification and Power Sector Issues. Rural electrification had registered a remarkable
achievement in the socio-economic development of Lao PDR, with household connections increased from
about 16 percent in 1995 to 46 percent in 2004. However, as electrification moved to increasingly remote
areas, on-grid electrification became less viable, which led the Government of Laos (GoL) to promote
off-grid models, with emphasis on renewable technologies.
GoL set an ambitious goal of electrifying 90 percent of the households by 2020 (70 percent by 2010 and
80 percent by 2015), and increasing hydropower exports to neighboring countries. Meeting these
objectives would require financing from sources other than the traditional concessionary lenders. Novel
financing models for non-traditional public and private financiers would need to be identified and the
regulatory framework adapted to suit.
Electricité du Laos (EdL) was a stated-owned, vertically integrated power utility that covered most of the
generation and 100% of transmission and distribution. It was corporatized in 1997, remaining wholly
GoL-owned. EdL’s financial viability depended on hydropower export revenues, significant GoL equity
injections, and soft financing from multilateral and bilateral agencies. EdL’s finances were strongly
impacted by the dramatic currency devaluations during the East Asia financial crisis of the late 1990s.
Since then, significant improvements resulted from the implementation of a Financial Recovery Plan that
helped EdL turn in strong financial performances in 2002 and 2003. However, EdL was not able to
achieve cost recovery from its core business but rather relied on GoL subsidies from dividends of
Government’s equity investment in hydropower to maintain financial viability. Further improvements
would be necessary in planning, operational efficiency and financing strategy to achieve cost recovery.
Loss reduction achievements had been significant, but with transmission and distribution losses above
20%, there was scope for further improvement. Finally, headquarters and branch operations were
fragmented and needed to be integrated through information technology and communication systems.
Rationale for Bank Assistance. IDA’s added value was three-fold: leverage, concessionary financing
and global knowledge. Prior to REP I, IDA had long-term engagement in rural electrification in Laos
through the Southern Provinces Electrification Project (closed in December 1994), Provincial Grid
Integration Project (closed in June 1999), and Southern Provinces Rural Electrification Project (SPRE,
closed in December 2004). Concessionary lending terms such as IDA were vital for electrification, which
requires capital subsidies to achieve social objectives. IDA’s continued association with rural
electrification was necessary for successful implementation of GoL’s rural electrification program. As in
the previous project SPRE, GEF-funded technical assistance and investment activities under REP I were
considered vital to increasing the contribution of renewable energy and energy efficiency (EE) in the
overall development of the power sector. IDA’s ability to bring global knowledge to sector reform
activities added value beyond the provision of grants. The ability to play this role derived from the deep
knowledge of the Lao power sector that IDA had gained and the relationship that had developed with
GoL/EdL over the previous decade, which merited continuation.
The Project was fully in line with the 2005 Country Assistance Strategy (2005-2008), designed to support
GoL’s National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy, which focused on sustained growth through
improved management of rural and national infrastructure development; and capacity development and
partnerships through strengthened key sectoral and provincial capacities and partnership with donors in
rural electrification.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)
This Project was the first phase of a two-phased Adaptable Program Loan (APL) Program (REP I and II).
The objectives of the APL Program are to: (i) increase access to electricity of rural households in
villages of targeted provinces; and (ii) achieve sustainability of power sector development. REP I closed
on March 31, 2012 and its additional financing closed on July 31, 2012. REP II was approved in February
2011, became effective in August 2011, and is expected to close on June 30, 2014.
The project development objectives (PDO) for REP I were to: (i) increase access to electricity of rural
households in villages of targeted provinces; and (ii) improve financial performance of the power sector.
It should be noted that the PDO set forth in the Development Grant Agreement dated June 2, 2006 was
different from the PDO from the PAD and reads as “the objective of the Project is to assist the Recipient
to implement, in the Project Provinces, Phase I of the Program which is designed to improve the living
standards and increase the income of rural households by providing access to electricity.? This is of
higher level and not supported by the key performance indicators defined in the PAD. In addition, the
PDO in the PAD, the Project Paper for AusAID additional financing, and the Development Grant
Agreement of REP II is the same as that in the PAD of REP I. For these reasons, the evaluation of this
ICR uses the PAD version as the reference point.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). The Project would provide access to electricity to about 52,000
rural households through grid extension and off-grid electrification and bring about: (i) implementation of
a tariff reform that would achieve a 4-percent return on EdL’s revalued assets and minimize cross-
subsidies among consumer categories by the end of REP II; (ii) development of procedures for efficient
budgetary allocations for utility expenses and timely payment of electricity bills by government agencies
to reduce EdL’s account receivables from five months to two months; (iii) development and
implementation of loss reduction programs that would reduce EdL’s system losses from around 22
percent to about 17 percent by the end of REP I and 13 percent by the end of APL Program; (iv)
development of planning and implementation capacity within EdL for demand side management (DSM)
and EE and piloting efficiency programs for scale up in REP II; (v) development of a sector financing
strategy for the purpose of scaling up investment in the power sector, and preparation of two small
hydropower projects and solicitation documents for piloting concessions to independent power producers
(IPPs) for scale up in REP II; (vi) development of rural electrification master planning capacity, and pilot
of alternative power generation technologies for scale up in REP II; and (vii) development of the
necessary legal, regulatory and institutional arrangements to enable the Rural Electrification Fund (REF)
to be accessible to other participants during REP II.
1.3 Original Global Environment Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved).
The global environment objectives (GEO) of the Project were: (i) substantial adoption of off-grid
renewable energy in the Government's rural electrification program growing from a 7-10 percent share of
all newly electrified households in SPRE to a 19 percent share with REP I; and (ii) increased efficiency of
energy supply by EdL and consumption by customers, that in turn would result in increased exports of
hydropower to, and reduced imports of thermal power from Thailand, with eventual greenhouse gas
(GHG) emission reductions, as thermal power plants would be operated for marginal production in
Thailand over the Project period.
Key Performance Indicators. Achievement of the GEO would be measured by: (i) number of villages
connected to the medium voltage (MV) grid and households connected to the low voltage (LV) network;
(ii) number of households electrified with off-grid renewable technologies; (iii) percentage of households
electrified by renewable off-grid technologies in relation to overall number of households electrified
through the Project; and (iv) implementation status of the Action Plan of Financial Sustainability for the
Power Sector.

1.6 Main Beneficiaries
The major direct beneficiaries of the Project would be rural households and business receiving access to
electricity services through the Project, including the extreme poor and disadvantaged, female-headed
families. With the addition of AusAID co-financing, the direct beneficiaries increased over the original
project target (see Annex 2 for details). With project support to the rural electrification reform, the
beneficiaries would broadly comprise 54% of the rural households and villages that did not have
electricity and were expected to receive access to electricity services over the following fifteen years.
Other beneficiaries would include EdL customers and consumers of all modern energy types because of
energy efficiency (EE) activities, EdL, Ministry of Energy and Mines (MEM), and provincial government
agencies because of strengthened capacity in planning, policy making and project management, as well
GoL and EdL and its ratepayers because the moderation of the rapid growth in domestic energy
consumption would help maintain/enhance export earnings from sales to Electricity Generation Authority
of Thailand (EGAT).

1.7 Original Components (as approved)
The Project would have two components, one to be executed by each implementing agency: EdL and
MEM (which was Ministry of Industry and Handicraft or MIH at appraisal). These components are

           prepare two small hydropower projects and solicitation documents for concessioning to
           independent power producers (IPP);
    B.6    Organization Strengthening of DOE/MEM (cost: US$0.75 million): (a) Strengthen
           organizational and management arrangements within MEM to enable it to undertake its
           expanded role and regulation of the power sector; (b) support the MEM Project Management
           Unit (PMU) in implementing the MEM component.

1.8 Revised Components
In June 2010, the Bank approved additional financing equivalent to US$9.42 million from AusAID and
using the PAD version of the PDO. The additional financing was necessary to close a financing gap
which occurred due to substantial price escalations for materials in 2006-07. The additional funds aimed
to enable the project to meet its grid extension targets, and scale up the project impacts with: (i) technical
assistance (TA) for DSM and energy efficiency; (ii) expansion of the “Power to the Poor (P2P)? program
which provided no interest credit support to the poorest rural households for upfront payments for
connection to the grid; (iii) additional SHS for off-grid electrification; (iv) support for the design, supply
and installation of village hydro; (v) TA for construction of pilot village level biomass power plants; and
(vi) procurement capacity building to ensure smooth project implementation. The AusAID-financed
project components and related costs are shown in the table below. Minor changes were made to the KPIs
as discussed in section 2.3 below.

1.9 Other significant changes
The closing date for the IDA and GEF Grants was extended for two years, from March 31, 2010 to March
31, 2012, to allow extra time for the completion of the AusAID-supported activities. The AusAID
additional financing restructuring was approved by the Country Director in March 2012 to (i) extend the
closing date from March 31, 2012 to July 31, 2012 to allow sufficient time for final delivery of SHS; (ii)
align the AusAID Grant Agreement with the approved Project Paper for the AusAID co-financing dated
June 18, 2010 to allow disbursements for the P2P program under the EDL grid extension component; and
(iii) reallocate funds between the on-grid component implemented by EdL and the off-grid component
implemented by MEM. A reallocation of GEF grant proceeds was approved on February 10, 2011 upon
GoL’s request.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Preparatory Studies. Project design was informed by several studies with financial support from the
Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development Fund (PHRD), the Energy Sector Management
Assistance Program (ESMAP) and Asia Sustainable and Alternative Energy (ASTAE). The studies
included: (i) a socio-economic survey of electrified and non-electrified villages and households and
establishment of a rural electrification database; (ii) a tariff study to identify appropriate tariff levels and
structure; (iii) a rural electrification framework study including review of existing off-grid delivery
models and examining alternatives for scaling up off-grid electrification; (iv) a study to define the overall
financing strategy for the sector; and (v) a distribution system loss reduction study. These studies
provided a solid technical underpinning for the project design. The extensive social-economic survey
data helped establish the project baseline, provided the necessary inputs for a detailed social, economic
and financial analysis of the Project, and were considered very valuable to inform two IEG (Independent
Evaluation Group) publications: the Welfare Impact of Rural Electrification: A Reassessment of the Costs
and Benefits (2008) and Project Performance Assessment Report for Laos Southern Provinces Rural
Electrification Project (2008).
Lesson Learned from SPRE and Other Projects. The Project built on cumulative experience and long-
term engagement of the Bank in the power sector of Laos, in particular the lessons learned from SPRE in
implementation both grid extension and off-grid program, as well as similar projects in other countries.
For example, it took into account one of the lessons learned from other GEF-financed projects that (i) in
an electrified village, the household connection rate is highly elastic to the connection charges. This was
confirmed again with the social-economic survey and encouraged EdL and the Bank to incorporate the
Power to the Poor (P2P) program (see next para); (ii) a staffing shortage in MEM was the major reason
for serious delays in off-grid electrification under SPRE, and an outsourced management contract was
designed under REP I to address this issue; and (iii) electrification, through on- and off-grid, needs to be
closely coordinated, and a Master Plan was designed to address this lesson.
Power to the Poor Program. The Project responded swiftly to one of the findings in the 2004 socio-
economic survey that approximately 20-40% of the households were still not connected to the grid two
years after grid arrival in the village by including a P2P program to increase the percentage of households
connected to the grid in a given village. The P2P was designed to provide interest-free credit to the
poorest rural households and to rural households headed by women that could not afford the upfront
charges for connection to the grid. These families would pay back the credit in monthly installments
based on their affordability, into a revolving P2P Fund, which would be used to support other
disadvantaged families. The program was piloted at the start of REP I, with IDA and GEF resources and
technical assistance under the IDA-supported Gender Action Plan, and was later expanded with EDL’s
own financial resources and the AusAID additional financing to REP I and IDA resources under REP II.
Risk Assessment. Project appraisal correctly identified and rated most of the important risks, including
substantial risk related to GoL’s commitments to tariff adjustment and offsetting Government account
receivables, as evidenced by the delays in annual tariff adjustment and still-not-resolved Government
                                                       5
arrears during project implementation; and the risk of weak capacity of MEM in managing and
implementing the off-grid electrification program. On the other hand, the risk of establishing the REF
regulatory framework in a manner that attracts private sector participation in rural electrification and the
risk of time and cost overruns were rated moderate and negligible at appraisal and proved to be
substantial during project implementation. Due to the decreasing collection rate of the repayments from
SHS users, the balance of the REF is running low and its sustainability is at question. This is particularly
relevant in view of the issues discussed in Section 2.2 below (under SHS) related to (i) the weak capacity
of MEM, and (ii) the much faster-than-expected grid extension making the current SHS scheme more
difficult to realize. An unforeseeable problem arose when the Project experienced a financing gap of over
30% of the costs of materials for grid extension due to sharp global increases in the prices of materials,
which exceeded the price contingency allowance of 10% of the project costs. Given that the financial gap
was subsequently resolved successfully and the government is taking actions to solve problems associated
with the REF component under the framework of REP II, the overall risk rating of being moderate at
appraisal is deemed appropriate.
Lending Instrument and Project Components: The choice of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL)
approach was appropriate as it allows continuous, long-term Bank engagement in sector reform,
achieving financial sustainability of the power sector and rural electrification in Laos. The triggers for
Phase II of the APL were thorough and reflected the implementation progress needed for preparing Phase
II. The Project had two major components each implemented by a different implementation agency,
making coordination between the two implementing agencies somewhat challenging. In addition, each
component had six subcomponents, which were critical for sector sustainability but posed implementation
challenges in a relatively weak capacity environment in MEM.
Quality at Entry Assessment. Quality at Entry of this operation was assessed by QAG as part of the
Quality at Entry Assessment (QEA8) done in 2007. The project was rated satisfactory overall, with
several dimensions rated highly satisfactory. See Section 5(a) on Bank performance for further details.
This ICR agrees with the overall assessment of the QAG. However, this ICR noted that the methodology
used in the original economic analysis led to an overestimation of net present value (see Annex 3 for
details).

2.2 Implementation
The large number of project components needed to build capacity, achieve financial sustainability in the
power sector as well as expand access to rural households—12 subcomponents, with 49 contracts for
good and services at appraisal—posed substantial challenges for project implementation. However, all
these activities were implemented largely smoothly, efficiently and well ahead of the original closing date
of March 31, 2010, by both implementing agencies, even though there were issues and delays in some
activities, especially for the off-grid programs funded by the additional financing. As a result, 24 triggers
for initiating the Phase II were largely met by June 2009, one and half years before closing, as shown in
table 1 of Annex 2.
Grid-extension Program. For grid extension to connect new households, which was the core activity of
REP I, EdL took about three years for a bottom-up system planning that required engaging seven
provincial branch offices, a village screening process based on social impact indicators and least cost for
connections, preparation of bidding documents, completion of International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
process for equipment and material supply, processing of Norad co-financing, and installation of 67 grid
extension subprojects on the ground, all achieved by September 2009, well ahead of the March 2010
closing date. This left EdL sufficient time to mobilize additional financing to address the financing gap
that emerged due to unexpected price escalations on international markets during 2007-2008. In parallel,
EdL also completed the project-supported master planning and pilot projects for loss reduction well ahead
of schedule, giving EdL sufficient time to mobilize its own resources to implement repeater programs and
achieving loss reductions far exceeding the targets for both REP I & II before the closing of REP I. For
activities beyond EdL’s control, such as settlement of arrears from GoL and tariff reform, EdL followed
up closely with the Prime Minister’s Offices and Ministry of Finance through MEM and ensured
successful implementation of annual tariff adjustments since 2005 in line with the Tariff Adjustment Plan,
                                                     6
and settlement of past arrears of 113 billion kip owed by GoL before appraisal, though there were delays
in annual tariff adjustments and new arrears were incurred due to insufficient budget allocations.
P2P Program. To help vulnerable and disadvantaged rural families, EdL was highly efficient in designing,
piloting and scaling up the gender sensitive P2P program, with support of the Bank Team. In the villages
where it was implemented, P2P helped over 90 percent of the vulnerable and disadvantaged families
(which amounted to 20 to 40 percent of the total families in the villages) connect to the grid. One of the
major reasons of efficient implementation of grid extension electrification program in Laos is EdL’s
strong capacity in planning, procurement, project management, financial management and associated
safeguard management built up over past 10 years under various capacity building programs supported
mainly by IDA. Strong commitment of the Government to the welfare of its people and highly motivated
staff of EdL for implementation were crucial to the success of the P2P program and the fast expansion of
access to grid-supplied electricity in the country.
Off-grid Program. The SHS program represented less than 20% of the total project cost under REP I and
only 2% of the total households electrified under the national electrification program. By September 2009
when the REP II was processed, MEM had completed the hiring of an international management
contractor VOPS to assist it in managing the off-grid program. In parallel, MEM had completed most of
the other investments and technical assistance activities, notably development and implementation of the
legal and institutional arrangements for REF to support private sector participation, biomass resources
mapping in Laos, feasibility studies of 14 selected micro hydropower sites, modification of charges
reflecting cost of the private sector PESCOs and achieved more than 90% collection rate under the hire-
and-purchase SHS program. The major success was mainly due to engagement of the VOPS Contractor to
assist MEM in implementation and management of off-grid electrification programs
Major Implementation Issues. Several issues arose during implementation, especially under the off-
grid program funded by the additional financing from AusAID.
Serious delays in implementing the SHS program funded by additional financing and poor support to
operation and maintenance (O&M) of operational SHS. The achievements of efficient implementation of
IDA and Norad funded SHS programs were mainly attributable to the excellent performance of the
Management Contractor, who was responsible for the planning, implementation, O&M and reflow
collections of the off-grid programs. However, the contract ended before the AusAID-supported off-grid
activities started and DoE took over. Thereafter, implementation performance and operation of the off-
grid programs deteriorated sharply. The ICB bidding documents for the additional SHSs took more than
two years to complete, and put the SHSs at risk (see para below). The performance of PESCOs in reflow
collection was not monitored closely and regular visits to customers for services and training on how to
operate and maintain their SHSs were not made. DoE management of withdrawal systems for inventory,
storage, repairing and maintaining SHS for re-use was poor. As a result spare parts not available on time,
solar panels were damaged since users failed to follow instructions, SHSs withdrawal procedures not
followed up, and some of the 5,338 SHSs returned to local government offices were not properly
maintained for reuse. The collection rate of user payments dropped from 90% before December 2009 to
56% in 2010 and 2011, to only 3% in 2012 because poor collections were not adequately monitored or
followed up. Given the significant decrease of the inflow to the REF relative to its outflow to cover
project expenditures, the sustainability of REF will be in jeopardy without immediate remedial action
under REP II.
High rate of SHS withdrawals. SHSs withdrawal was expected and withdrawal procedures were
developed by the Management Contractor to manage the withdrawal process to ensure the returned SHSs
could be used again for new customers, at discounted prices. During REP I, some 5,338 systems
(including those installed in SPRE and REP I) were withdrawn, most of which had been used for about
two years before withdrawal. Withdrawal was mainly due to the rapid roll-out of EdL’s on-grid
expansion, which exceeded expectations of the project design and the Rural Electrification Master Plan.
While the withdrawal was expected, the problem was that the systems were returned incomplete (without
controllers and batteries) or were not in good condition. Re-deploying these systems will require
acquisition of the missing parts, which represent about 70-80% of the total equipment cost. Guidelines on
how to reuse withdrawn SHS are being updated under REP II.
                                                    7
As clearly stated above, the implementation of the current scheme has become flawed, judging from the
most recent collection rates of about 3 percent. The reason for this is believed to have more to do with the
success of the Government’s grid electrification initiative which has effectively limited the areas of
operation for the SHS to the most remote, difficult, dispersed and inaccessible areas of the country than
with the design of the SHS business model per se. The former, in conjunction with the extension of the
repayment schedule from five years to 10 years, to enhance the affordability of SHS, generated
insurmountable challenges for SHS sustainability. This may render the current SHS structure ineffective
as it would no longer be possible to recover the investment in the equipment due to the extremely high
costs of payment collection and maintenance. Going forward, the SHS initiative will have to be targeted
to the most remote villages, unlikely to be connected to the grid in the next 10 years. This would require
higher subsidies on equipment and installation and aiming at facilitating the creation of local small village
suppliers of standardized spare parts to provide maintenance support and ensure the sustainability of the
SHS systems.
The AusAID-financed activities for the off-grid component were at risk of not being completed by the
closing date due to procurement delays. There were serious delays in procuring the second batch of SHS
equipment funded by the AusAID additional financing when DoE took over from the Management
contractor. Given the long-standing issues on the implementation of the SHS program, the Bank and
AusAID wanted to agree with MEM on the breakdown of SHS by province before the contract was
signed as the current allocation was not fully consistent with the Rural Electrification Master Plan nor did
it reflect the plans of PESCOs. The 5,000 SHS through the procurement in question were eventually
delivered before the closing date of the AusAID additional financing and are to be installed with REP II
support.
Processing of Co-financing. The Project raised a significant amount of co-financing from AusAID, EdL,
MEM, and users and parallel financing from Norad. However, it was a challenge to meet the
administrative requirements of the different donors. One ICB contract scheduled to be financed by Norad
was signed and the first delivery of goods took place before the loan structure for Norad financing was
finalized. It took the Bank quite a long time to process the AusAID co-financing as well. The framework
agreement for the trust fund was signed in May 2009 but the co-financing grant agreement was not signed
until October 2010 (17 months later), despite being appraised in October 2009. Delays in availability of
funds from AusAID additional financing compressed the time available for implementation. However,
EdL managed to mobilize its own resources to fund the activities in advance in absence of the Norad and
AusAID funds, such as for the ICB contract supported by Norad and the P2P funded by AusAID
financing.
2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design. The M&E design of the Project consisted of socio-economic surveys before and after the
Project and a results monitoring framework. The indicators included in the results framework are
adequate to monitor progress toward PDO/GEO. However, there were discrepancies in terms of the target
value for one of the PDO indicators, namely the number of HH electrified, between the results monitoring
framework in Annex 3 and the main text of the PAD (the latter, a higher figure, is used in this evaluation).
In addition, there were four core GEO indicators in the main text of PAD and only two in the results
monitoring framework (this evaluation uses the latter since the other two are repetitive of one PDO
indicator and one intermediate indicator).
M&E implementation. The 2004 social economic survey was successfully carried out. A follow-up
socio economic survey began after the closing of REP I but the results are not yet available. (They should
be available later in 2013 for use under REP II.) In addition, the survey of EdL customers on awareness
and adoption of EE technologies was last done in 2008 but no subsequent survey was done. The
performance indicators included in the results monitoring framework were monitored and reported to the
Bank on a regular basis.
In the Additional Financing Project Paper, small changes were made to the Results Framework to show
two indicators pertaining to the P2P program and two indicators for SHS installed and HH served by
micro-hydro and biomass.
                                                     8
M&E utilization. The 2004 social economic survey provided an excellent baseline for the monitoring
and evaluation of the Project. The key result indicators were adequate for monitoring the project progress
and informed the Bank as well as the implementing agencies of issues related to project implementation.
For example, key indicators for tracking the financial performance of EdL were constantly tracked and
reported, and non-compliance with related financial covenants was timely identified and follow-up
actions were discussed between the Bank and the Borrower.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguards: The Project was appropriately assigned “Category B?, as potential impacts were expected to
be moderate. Four safeguards policies were triggered by the project (i) Environmental Assessment
(OP/BP/GP 4.01); (ii) Involuntary Resettlement (OP/BP 4.12); (iii) Indigenous Peoples (OD 4.20, revised
as OP 4.10); and Forests (OP/BP 4.36). All relevant framework documents and management action plans
(RPF, EMDS, EMP, RAP), were prepared satisfactorily to IDA, for both on- and off-grid components to
address the safeguard issues, and were disclosed locally and on the internet. No major or irreversible
environmental and social impacts occurred under the project, and mitigation measures applied adequately
mitigated negative impacts. Consultations were carried out adequately and prior to the commencement of
civil works with affected people. Impacts on loss of land and other productive assets were adequately
compensated as per RAP. Ethnic minorities were given priorities in receiving project benefits within the
limits of technical feasibility.
Monitoring of EMP/IPA implementation was regularly undertaken by the Environment Office of EdL
on quarterly basis. Environmental impacts were minimal and managed through applying good
construction practices. Cutting and trimming of trees or tree branches to facilitate the installation of poles
was done and monitored according to the EMP. EdL branch offices made agreement(s) with individual
household according to the social safeguard framework and recorded the voluntary contributions. No
external review on EMP/RAP implementation was carried under the Project. Limited number of
environmental and social safeguards staff at central and branch offices of EdL was a major challenge
during project preparation. However, with support of the Bank both EdL and DoE/IREP, managed to
assess the environmental and social issues and prepared frameworks on a learning-by-doing basis. The
capacity of the EdL and DoE/IREP has gradually been improved under the Project. To date EdL
completed the environmental preparation works independently (including implementation monitoring)
with limited consultant supports. Further strengthening the capacity of EdL/IREP on safeguard
monitoring and reporting is being provided under REP II with Norad financing.
Procurement. There were no major issues regarding compliance with Bank procurement guidelines.
Procurement of goods and consultants was carried out conducted at the central level following
satisfactory procurement plans and standard procedures. All major equipment and materials were
procured through ICB or National Competitive Bidding (NCB).
The procurement activities under each sub-component of the EdL component were carried out by the staff
of the respective EdL departments. As a result, there were some delays in procurement for those sub-
components due to lack of procurement experience in some of EdL’s units. In addition, frequent EdL staff
movement (every 2-3 years) negatively impacted procurement performance. Overall, procurement was
carried out satisfactorily. All procurement activities under the MEM component were satisfactorily
conducted with the assistance of an international procurement consultant. The services of the international
procurement consultant were reduced toward the end of REP I.
Financial Management. The financial management arrangements put in place for both components met
the Bank’s minimum requirements as per OP/BP 10.02. Financial management was rated Satisfactory up
to 2008 but was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in 2009 due to (i) lack of progress in rolling out
the Accounting and Financial Management System (AFMS), (ii) an increase in PESCO debts, and (iii)
late submission of the interim unaudited financial reports (IFRs) and audit reports. The FM rating
remained moderately satisfactory until 2011 when it was downgraded to Moderately Unsatisfactory at the
end of the project for reasons because of (i) problems identified with REF operations, (ii) the quarterly
IFRs and audit report were submitted late, (iii) the audit opinion for EdL corporate financial statements
                                                      9
had a disclaimer, and (iv) the accounting system needed to be strengthened and a suitable computerized
accounting software needed to be implemented. A second Action Plan for Financial Sustainability to
improve EDL financial performance is being prepared under REP II and includes specific actions to
enhance EDL’s financial management, accounting and reporting.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
REP II, currently under implementation, is continuing most of the activities initiated under REP I. REP
II consists of a US$20 million IDA grant, US$1.818 million GEF grant, US$4 million Norad loan, and
US$15 million IFC loan. Some 5,000 pieces of SHS equipment which were purchased with AusAID co-
financing are expected to be installed under REP II. REP1 implementation arrangements, including the
EdL and MEM teams, are implementing REP1 follow-up and REP II. REP II will continue to monitor
EdL’s financial performance through a new financial sustainability action plan and is scheduled to work
with the Government to develop a new action plan for its financial sustainability. In addition, issues
related to the SHS subcomponent, including the sustainability of the REF and the performance of
PESCOs, are being addressed through the supervision of REP II. Procurement preparation activities are
also being addressed by producing standardized specifications to ensure faster turn-around.

3. Assessment of Outcomes
While the Project has twelve components and two core PDO indicators, the grid extension and off-grid
investment subcomponents and related PDO indicator (number of HH and villages electrified) accounted
for more than 80% of the total project costs and more than 70% of Bank financing. Therefore they are
weighted more heavily in assessing the project outcomes.

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

Relevance Rating: High
The Project objectives, design and implementation remain relevant at present given the needs and
challenges faced by Laos in national electrification. By supporting rural infrastructure development,
targeting especially the poor rural population, and promoting sector-wide reforms and institution building,
REP I contributed towards meeting GoL’s goal of poverty reduction and establishment of an enabling
environment for growth and development as set in the National Growth and Poverty Eradication Strategy.
REP I also supports the Country Partnership Strategy (FY12-16) strategic objective of improving
competitiveness and connectivity and the overarching IDA goal of poverty reduction.
The Project contributed to removing barriers to achieving global environmental objectives through
activities on demand side management and EE and promotion of renewable energy development, which
were fully in line with the GoL’s Climate Change Strategy.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives and Global Environment Objectives
Rating of Project Outcome: Satisfactory
PDO (a): Increase access to electricity of rural households in villages of targeted provinces: Rating:
Highly Satisfactory
The Project achieved its first PDO as it electrified 65,897 HHs, exceeding the original target of 52,000 by
by 29% and the revised target of 65,250 HHs by 3%. Under the grid extension component, the Project
brought electricity to 57,039 HHs, including 18,353 HHs under the AusAID financing.
Under the off-grid investment program, the project installed 10,246 SHS, exceeding the original target of
providing off-grid electrification to 10,000 HHs. However, 5,338 SHS were withdrawn after the arrival
of grid-based electricity.


                                                    10
Overall, the Project contributed to the country’s phenomenal success in expanding the rate of
electrification from 46 percent in 2004 to 80 percent as of September 2012 (see Figure 1 below), reaching
the country’s goal of an 80 percent coverage by 2015 more than three years in advance. Approximately 20
percent of the total number of households electrified between 2006 and 2012 can be attributed to the
financial support of the Project. Although no statistical evidence is available at this time, based on field
visits and interviews done during ICR preparation, the impacts of the Project include improving living
conditions (better lighting, electric appliances and water pumping) and enabling more electricity-based
income-generation activities (such as rice milling, carpentry, handicrafts, convenience shops, better
telecommunications, etc.) which have contributed to poverty reduction and economic growth. In some
villages, electricity services led to better community planning (cluster of newly built houses, more
permanent house structures, and new roads).
                               Figure 1: Households electrified 1993-2012




The fast rural electrification process is mainly attributable to the strong government commitments, by
providing policy and financial support and the strong capacity of EdL in planning, design, procurement,
project implementation, system operation and maintenance. This is also the outcome of Bank’s continued
support since mid-1990s, in collaboration with Norad and AusAID in the later stage, in not only
investment in grid-extension for access expansion but also sector reform and capacity building for
implementation, operation efficiency and financial sustainability, through a series of projects including
PGI, SPRE, and the REP I. All these efforts are continuing under the on-going REP II.
PDO (b): improve financial performance of the power sector. Rating: Satisfactory.
The second PDO was achieved as evidenced by the power sector/EdL achieved cost recovery (including
cost of power generation / purchase, distribution and transmission) in 2007 for the first time in history—
excluding dividends from Government stakes in IPP hydropower investment—and remained profitable
onwards from its core business, though the indicators for financial performance of EdL at project closing
could not be measured on the same basis at appraisal due to the spin-off of the profit-making generation
assets in 2009. Turning from losses to profit making of energy services in Laos was mainly due to (i)
system loss reduction by about 9.5%, reducing cost of services by the same percentage; and (ii) successful
implementation of the Tariff Reform (2005-2010), which was designed to (a) phase out government
subsidies through hydropower dividends; (b) minimize cross-subsidies among consumer categories; and
(c) achieve cost-recovery first and a 4% return on EdL’s revaluated assets.
The great success in the tariff reform during 2005-2010, with permissible tariff adjustments every year,
received strong Government support and little public resistance, and contributed greatly to improving
sector financial performance. The success was mainly because (i) it was designed based on the
affordability of rural consumers as confirmed by the extensive social economic survey during project
preparation; (ii) it provided a life line tariff for the poor; (iii) it took a gradual annual increase approach
                                                      11
over the reform period; and (iv) its design was based on an extensive tariff study that ensured the
weighted average of tariff would gradually go above the weighted average of cost of services to different
customer categories. As a result, EdL was able to (i) spin off EdL-Gen as one of the two most profitable
public firms for initiating the Lao stock exchange market in 2010; and (ii) contribute increased
counterpart funding to invest in loss reduction, implementation of the P2P and installation of AusAID-
funded subprojects.
In the period 2006-11, EdL made notable reductions in distribution loss, which decreased from 22 percent
(including about 2% transmission losses) in 2006 to 10.45 percent in 2011. One percent (1%) loss
reduction is equivalent to saving Lao Kip 19.5 billion or US$2.44 million per annum 1.
However, following the spin-off of EdL-Gen (of which EdL owns 75 percent) in 2010, the parent
company EdL experienced a sharp fall in its operating margin and suffered an operating loss in 2011, the
first time in more than a decade. To address EdL’s deteriorating financial performance, a second 5-year
Financial Action Plan (2013-2017) is being prepared under REP-II. Moreover, GoL introduced a new
tariff adjustment in March 2012 based on the Tariff Reform (2011-2015) prepared in 2009-2010 by an
international consulting firm, by which all tariff categories increased by about 18 percent by end 2012 and
is to subsequently increase by 2 percent per year thereafter until 2017. It is expected that with the recent
tariff adjustments and introduction of second 5-year Financial Action Plan EdL’s operating margin will
turn positive again in 2014. In addition, as EdL-Gen is listed in the Lao Stock Exchange, it is expected to
attract more private sector investments in developing hydro resources for electricity exports, enabling
EdL to provide more sustainable, reliable and affordable electricity services to a larger base of domestic
customers.
EdL successfully developed planning and implementation capacity for DSM and EE and is positioned to
scale up DSM and EE activities in REP II. The Project also succeeded in developing RE master planning
capacity, and laid the preparation work on business models and regulatory framework needed for
development of small hydro projects.
Rating of GEF Outcome: Satisfactory
The Project’s first GEO was achieved as substantial adoption of off-grid renewable energy in the
Government’s rural electrification program was met, growing from a 7-10% share of all newly electrified
HH (under SPRE) to a 19% share under REP I. The second GEO of increased EE awareness was
partially met in 2008 according to survey data from the “Demand-Side Management and Energy
Efficiency Phase I Completion Report, June 2008?. However EE awareness could not be assessed at
project completion for lack of more recent survey data. The Project successfully expanded the
dissemination of SHS for rural, remote households using an innovative delivery mechanism and laid the
foundation for developing small hydro and biogas technologies at the village levels through IFC
investment advisory services. One of the unintended benefits of SHS was that it provided temporary
electrification services (pre-electrification) prior to the arrival of the grid. The Project also helped EdL
establish a DSM cell to manage EE activities and achieved initial success in increasing the awareness of
EdL customers of EE technologies and practices. At least some 46% residential, 66% commercial and
industrial customers of EDL have been aware of EE

3.3 Efficiency

Rating: Satisfactory
Both economic and financial analyses show that the Project is viable despite the difference of the NPVs at
project appraisal and completion (see Annex 3 for details). At a 10 percent discount rate, the economic
benefit of the EdL component is estimated at a net present value (NPV) of US$33.4 million at project

        Based on EDL audited Financial report 2011.


                                                      12
completion compared with an estimated US$280.8 million at appraisal. The difference is primarily due to
a change of the shape of the demand curve for lighting from a linear to more realistic log-linear with a
constant price elasticity, which results in a US$264.5 million downward adjustment to the NPV over the
lifetime of the project. Other factors, such as expansion of project scope and appreciation of local
currency against US dollar, in combination contribute to a net increase of US$ 20 million in NPV.
The economic benefit of the MEM (off-grid SHS) component is estimated to range between US$39 and
US$84 in NPV per system at project completion, compared with an estimated range between US$84 and
US$109 per system at appraisal. The difference is primarily due to two factors: (i) an increase of upfront
costs by US$111 - 174 per system; and (ii) a correction to the methodology for calculating willingness-to-
pay (WTP) 2 resulting in an upward adjustment to the estimated benefit of US$22 - 32 per system per year,
or US$80 - 121 in NPV over the lifetime of the project.
At a 10 percent weighted average cost of capital (WACC), the financial NPV (FNPV) of the grid
extension component is estimated at US$13.6 million under the agreed subsidy arrangements and tariff
regime at project completion compared with an estimated US$6.4 million at appraisal. The difference is
primarily due to the increased scope of the project with additional co-financing from AusAID. The
FNPV of SHS is estimated to range between US$8 and US$114 per system at project completion
compared with an estimated range between US$7 and US$35 per system at appraisal. The difference is
primarily due to: (i) an increase of upfront costs by US$111 - 174 per system; (ii) changes in household
repayment schedule from 5 to actual 10 years, and (iii) appreciation of local currency LAK against US
dollar.
A related question is that whether the Project-supported investments are cost effective, i.e. whether they
are least-cost solutions. While unit connection cost was not an explicit consideration in the Rural
Electrification Master Plan, the project established a systematic methodology to select grid extension
subprojects based on a screening and prioritization process and least unit connection cost. For example,
villages with clinics, schools, churches, irrigation and higher potential for economic growth were given
high priority for grid extension through allocating more weight when calculation the unit connection cost
of a specific subproject and each subproject was selected based on the least weighted average unit
connection cost 3 . However, in some villages, grid extension either by EdL, provincial authorities, or
private sector took place much earlier than expected in villages where SHS were recently installed.
Private sector investments in grid extension were difficult to project; often the provinces jump at the
private sector’s offer for making electrification investments to achieve quick results and to meet or exceed
electrification targets. In other villages, even with the anticipation of grid extension in the near future,
SHS were provided any way as a means of pre-electrification so that the users can have electricity
services immediately. Such pre-electrification for a short period is justifiable for social and equity
consideration, but the economic price is high as the reuse value of withdrawn solar PVs was under
US$100 while the total cost of the system (including equipment, installation and administration) was in
the range of US$430 - US$600 depending of system capacities.
The GEF grants provided incremental values in catalyzing the expansion of off-grid renewable energy
technologies for rural electrification and the promotion of energy efficiency. Specifically, GEF provided
support for strengthening institutional capacity in managing off-grid program in MEM, integrating off-
grid technologies in overall electrification program, and institutionalizing the promotion of EE in EdL

         At appraisal, the economic analysis equates WTP for lighting to consumer surplus from SHS-based lighting vis-à-vis
previous methods of lighting, such as candles, lamps and car batteries. In doing so, the WTP is underestimated due to the
omission of the amount paid for SHS-based lighting, which ranges between US$22 and US$32 per household annually in 2006
dollar.

operations. Without GEF support, these activities would not have taken place or have had the same level
of efforts invested during the Project life.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome and Global Environment Outcome Rating
Overall Outcome Rating: Satisfactory
All key activities financed by IDA, GEF, Norad and AusAID were delivered and the outputs and
outcomes are in line with or beyond the original targets. In particular, the number of households
electrified by the Project exceeded the original target by 29 percent, and the sector financial performance
has improved dramatically. More important, this Project and Bank-financed energy sector activities prior
to and following this one have played an irreplaceable role in empowering the people of Laos for more
than two decades in terms of both financing, technical assistance and institutional strengthening.
Continuous Bank engagement leveraged a total of US$178 million (nominal value) of project investments,
contributed to the dramatic increase of electricity coverage in Laos from 16 percent in 1995 to over 80
percent today while its GDP is relatively low, and provided valuable technical advice and global
knowledge in transforming EdL from a poor-performing, high-loss utility to one with moderate losses and
a cadre of highly qualified technical and managerial professionals.
It is important to note that the overall outcome of the Project, grid extension and off-grid combined,
exceeded the original target in terms of the number of households electrified. This project, together with
continued support of the Bank, made critical contribution to the expansion of access to electricity in Laos,
one of the low income countries with fastest expansion of rural electrification in the world.
Global Environment Outcome Rating: Satisfactory
The GEF components were implemented in accordance with the project design and the GEO outcomes is
rated satisfactory because (i) GHG emission reduction far exceeded the target, due to loss reduction
targets achieved far beyond targets and much earlier in time - which is the major contributor to GHG
emission reduction; (ii) SHS share also exceeded the targets 19% at the beginning. Withdrawal, which
represents better energy service and faster development of rural electrification in Laos did not have
negative global environmental impacts.
3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Both the P2P and SHS programs benefited the poorer of the poor with innovative financing mechanisms

    Box 1. As one example, PHONSAAD Village in
    southern Laos had 272 households in 2009. The
    Village was electrified in 2002 under the SPRE.
    There were still 72 households not connected to the
    grid by Jan 2009, mostly because they were poor
    and could not afford the connection charges of
    about $85. With the Power to the Poor program,
    all the 72 households were connected to the grid
    within 2 months in February – March 2009.
                                                               Mrs. Tim and children, Nongsala Village, Champasak
    Mrs. Tim lives in a household of eight people,             Province
    including herself, her husband, and six children.
    They, like most other rural villagers used to
    depend on kerosene and candles that supplied a
    very poor level of household lighting. Now, Mrs.
    Tim and her family are not only enjoying the better
    quality lighting and watching their black and white
    television and are now able to work later into the
    night to make brooms that are exported to
    Thailand. Their SHS system allows her to earn an
    additional $15 per week                                               Mrs. Tim’s 50Wp solar panel
                                                          14
without which, the beneficiary households would be still using candles and kerosene for lighting,
spending more on energy, and being deprived of entertainment, cultural and income-generating activities.
These families are also very proud of being able to pay for electricity services. Families interviewed by
the Project team during field trips reported savings on monthly expenditures on energy after being
connected to the grid or acquiring SHS. EdL, despite making records for fast growing grid expansion and
household connection during the project period, had advanced the scale-up of the P2P program using its
own resources to help vulnerable and disadvantaged families connect to the grid. This brought the
expected social benefits to these families ahead of schedule before the expected IDA financing for scaling
up the P2P became available. The P2P had extensive consultations with local communities, Lao Women's
Union, and targeted disadvantaged families in a gender sensitive approach. Gender was fully integrated in
the project activities and all female-headed households were eligible for the P2P support. (In fact, this
was praised in the QAG assessment.) The SHS program also carried out extensive consultation with
potential users, village chiefs and council members, as well as the private sector. Religious groups and
health service providers also benefitted from better electricity services provided through the Project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Project made a lasting institutional impact as evidenced by having: (i) an improved policy
environment and regulatory framework, including cost-recovery tariff, reduced cross subsidies, and power
sector financing strategy; (ii) a rural electrification master plan in place; and (iii) strengthened human
capacities in EdL and MEM in project management, environmental and social impact management,
renewable technologies, and English language. (See Annex 2 for more detail)
The Project spent sizable resources on (i) standardizing distribution network design (a design report
prepared); (ii) standardizing materials to manage inventories; (iii) bottom-up distribution expansion
planning, which allows EdL to make quick copies of work for procurement and funding. These are
contributing factors for rapid implementation of grid-extension investment projects and the similarly
rapidly growing access rate in Laos.
(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
In some villages after the arrival of the grid, SHS beneficiaries relocated the systems to the rice field for
lighting and continue to make monthly payments to PESCOs. As a result, they can work for longer hours
in the field after the dark and avail themselves of daytime hours for other productive activities. This way,
the Project indirectly supported productive uses for these families.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops
At the stakeholder workshop that took place on September 29, 2012, participants acknowledged that the
Project had a significant impact in reducing energy poverty and accelerating the electrification efforts led
by EdL and MEM in terms of both investments and capacity building (Laos is expected to achieve its 90
percent electricity coverage target by 2015, five years ahead of schedule). Setting an ambitious target with
clearly defined action plan and responsible parties at the central and provincial levels is key to the success.
The Project was also commended for promoting renewable energy for off-grid electrification in addition
to grid extension. Finally, the participants commented on areas for potential improvement, including:
•       Better, regular stakeholder consultation and exchanges on rural electrification
•       Stronger commitment needed for off-grid electrification
•       Need to review/revise the SHS hire-purchase delivery model
•       Need to review/enforce import tax exemption on renewable energy goods
•       Need to put more emphasis on energy efficiency
•       Need to improve the consultation with prospective SHS users on the size of the SHS, potential
        uses of the electricity generated by SHS, and the life time of the battery

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome and Global Environment Outcome

Risk to Development Outcome Rating: Moderate
The distribution networks and customers managed by EdL are at low risk as EdL has strong technical
capacity and a track record in reducing distribution losses. Moderate risks exist that the tariff adjustment
that is in effect for 2012-2016 might be subject to political interference. EdL’s government arrears are at
substantial risk to rise further; as noted in Section 3.2, the fundamental issue of MoF allocating sufficient
budget for irrigation and other public uses remains to be resolved.
Risk to Global Environment Outcome Rating: moderate
The GEF outcome related to off-grid electrification faces moderate risk depending on the availability and
quality of maintenance services and such risk may be greater if a more permanent institutional
arrangement for maintenance of SHS will not be in place by the closing of the ongoing REP II.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
The Project was well prepared with strong technical underpinning for the proposed sector policy reform
and justification for the social-economic viability of the proposed investment activities. The Bank
managed to mobilize adequate resources to enable several comprehensive diagnostic and project design
studies as well as a large scale socio-economic survey that lent important inputs to the final project design.
The Bank team supported MEM in some improvements over the business model for the SHS program
that was used in SPRE, such as outsourcing day-to-day management and monitoring of the SHS program
to a private firm. In addition to the complexity of the delivery model, the adverse effect of the successful
on-grid electrification program has led to serious issues with the SHS program. These risks may have
been underestimated at appraisal.
The QAG of the Bank assessed the quality at entry of this project in the QEA8 of 2007. Overall, the
project received a satisfactory rating. Strategic relevance and approach, poverty, gender and social
development, policy and institutional aspects, and risk assessment all received highly satisfactory ratings.
The environmental aspects, fiduciary aspects, and implementation arrangements were rated satisfactory.
Bank inputs and processes were rated moderately satisfactory, as were the technical and financial
analyses under the technical, financial and economic aspects. The following were assessed as strong
aspects of the design:
    •   The project was built upon the achievements of a successful predecessor project;
    •   It was anchored on strong economic and social objectives, and the basis for economic
        diversification was well thought out;
    •   There was strong Government commitment and a strategy for expansion of coverage, with several
        key reforms taking place even prior to project launch;
    •   There were good linkages with other donors and with the private sector (the role of which was
        expected to expand);
    •   The documentation evidenced excellent attention to social/poverty aspects;
    •   There was appropriate attention to demand-side management and other EE measures; and
    •   The economic analysis was very well done. It would have been best practice if conventional
        sensitivity analysis had been carried out and some of the community level benefits analyzed.
Areas that needed improvement were:
    •   The financial analysis could have been more thorough, and the sources of data and the
        assumptions were not spelled out properly in the PAD. The rationale for the financial covenants
        was not spelled out well;

                                                     16
    •   There were too many triggers for the second phase of the APL, and it appeared they were not
        subject to strategic scrutiny;
    •   Training represented an extremely small share of the total of TA and training. The M&E
        indicators, while reasonable on outcomes of TA/training, would have benefited from more detail
        on how the benefits of training in terms of workplace performance would be evaluated and
        adjusted as implementation of Phase I proceeded.
This ICR agrees with the QAG rating and assessment of strengths and areas for improvement as discussed
in Section 2. However, the methodology used in the original economic analysis led to an overestimation
of economic benefits of the Project which has been corrected in this analysis (Annex 3).
(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
Bank support to project implementation, with two regular missions per year and large number of visits on
call by the government agencies to resolve procurement, financial management, social, environmental and
technical issues on the ground on a timely manner, which was one of the major reasons of success of the
project. The Bank spent tremendous time and resources in trying to provide timely support to the IAs,
coordinated with various donors to joint supervisions
The task team extended the supervision to Norad's financed activities, including all technical and
fiduciary review of their procurement package to get all packages ready for Norad just to sign off, since
Norad did not have supervision budget and HR resources. Also the Bank has uplifted sector issues beyond
the Project to donor communities and to other Bank financed projects in trying to achieve solutions, such
as the tariff adjustment. In addition, the bank have tremendous SPN budget saving due to piloting and
conducting cluster supervision. The quality, timeliness efficiency and effectiveness of Bank SPN are all
at high level.
Bank supervision benefited from posting the TTLs in the Bangkok office where they could supervise the
Project more closely. In face of a significant financing gap, the Bank actively looked for co-financing
instead of reducing the scope of the Project. The Bank team also did an excellent job in facilitating
knowledge sharing and transfer between Laos and other countries in rural electrification and documented
and disseminated the Project’s experience in various media forms. Co-operation between Bank staff and
EdL/MEM staff was exemplary which contributed to satisfactory implementation of the Project.
However, there were significant delays in negotiating and signing the AusAID co-financing because of
inadequate follow-up by the Bank team for trust fund management. The first negotiated package was sent
to the government in March 2010 – it was supposed to be negotiated by exchange of letters. The Bank
did not follow up regularly and then it discovered errors in the legal agreements, so the Bank had to send
a revised package in July 2010 and it was not signed until October 2010. There were also delays by the
Task Team in processing the restructuring and extension of the AusAID co-financing, although the
process was completed before the current closing date as required. Much time was spent by the Task
Team to get the most critical Power Sector Financial Action Plan, including the detailed Tariff
Adjustment Plan for 2006-2011.
Regarding safeguard supervision, environmental and social specialists based in Country Office and in
neighboring countries participated in project implementation support missions and had regular
communication with environmental and social department of EdL and DoE. They provided inputs to
many Aide Memoirs and provided technical guidance when EdL needs clarifications.
Bank supervision performance is rated based on comments/responses and interview with the Government,
IAs, and development partners.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
Although there were a few shortcomings in project design, in particular some underestimation of risks,
and delays on the Bank side in processing the AusAID co-financing and its restructuring, the Bank’s
performance is still considered satisfactory based on solid analysis during preparation, strong
                                                   17
implementation support, mobilization of large amount of co-financing from other development partners to
complement limited IDA resources, and the fact that the project was able to achieve its PDO and most of
intermediate results.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Government commitment to rural electrification has been generally strong. GoL set a clear vision of rural
electrification and mobilized/consolidated financing resources and institutional initiatives by different
donors, at the central and provincial levels toward a common target. Because of the strong Government
commitment, the P2P program for grid-based rural electrification has achieved impressive social benefits.
At times when IDA funding for the P2P Program was not available due to price escalations in other
activities, EdL and MEM provided own resources to support the scale up of P2P in selected provinces.
Although investing in P2P is not financially rewarding for EdL, both EdL and MEM were committed to
helping the vulnerable and disadvantaged families to achieve a greater social impact through rural
electrification. Without the strong commitment of GoL to bring the benefits of electrification to its people
or the highly motivated staff of EdL for implementation, these rural families would have remained
unconnected to the grid and socio-economic development slower.
Annual tariff adjustment for 2005-2010 was implemented satisfactorily starting 2005. The
implementation of the revised tariff plan for 2011-2015 which is close to the cost-recovery was delayed
but made effective in March 2012. For most of the Project life, key financial performance indicators
satisfied covenanted requirements. However, for the last two years of the Project, EdL was in breach of
two of the three financial covenants (debt service coverage; and the self-financing ratios).
MoF has still not provided adequate budget to settle GoL arrears which remain significant and settlement
of these arrears will further improve EdL's financial performance.
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
EdL’s performance is highly satisfactory. EdL was highly efficient in implementing grid extension
projects, faster than the original schedule. EdL leadership was and remains very committed to social
electrification despite the fact that programs such as P2P are not profit-making business. Staff at EdL
headquarters and its branch offices are highly motivated to implementing the Project (and whole
Program) and meeting the electrification targets. The branch offices are well supported in project
planning, design, procurement and delivery of results. EdL took a bottom-up approach of village
screening (based on social impact indicators and least cost connections), preparation of bidding
documents, completion of ICB process for equipment and material supply, processing of Norad co-
financing, and installation of 67 grid extension subprojects on the ground. These were achieved by
September 2009, well ahead of the March 2010 closing date. In parallel, EdL also completed the project-
supported master planning and pilot projects for loss reduction well ahead of schedule, giving EdL
sufficient time to mobilize its own resources to implement repeater programs and achieving loss
reductions far exceeding the targets for both REP I & II before the closing of REP I.
However, there had been some delays in procurement for other EdL-implemented subcomponents due to
staff movement and lack of coordination among different management units of EdL. In addition EDL did
not undertake a follow-up survey on energy awareness.
MEM’s performance is moderately satisfactory. The PMU in the MEM has been very committed despite
the fact that implementation of the off-grid component is extremely challenging because of geographic
remoteness and disperse distribution of project beneficiaries and the complexity of the off-grid delivery
mechanism. MEM completed with efficiency the IDA and GEF supported investment and capacity
building program, including hiring the Management Contractor, quality supervision contractor,
identification of HHs subscribing for the IDA-funded 10,000 SHS, procurement, transportation and
installation of some 10,000 SHS well in advance of March 2010 closing date. The extensive technical

                                                    18
assistance and capacity building activities under the other five subcomponents were mostly completed by
September 2009 when the REP II was processed. However, after the ending of the management contract
and quality supervision contract, the implementation of off-grid programs supported by AusAID
Additional Financing faced tremendous difficulties and challenges due to the weak capacity of the MEM
team. The success of the on-grid program has provided additional challenges to the implementation of the
off-grid programs. That MEM works with the private sector for the provision of electricity services to end
users is a relatively new experience in Laos and is effectively creating new markets with many challenges
in “unchartered territory?. On the other hand, MEM faced difficulties in successfully monitoring and
evaluating the performance of private PESCOs and maintaining the continuity of the VOPS assistance. It
was slow at issuing appropriate guidelines for SHS operations and maintenance, reusing withdrawn SHS,
as well as in responding to complaints against the performance of PESCOs and Village Energy Managers
(VEMs), and in reviewing the effectiveness and relevance of the SHS delivery mechanisms.
(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
Based on the assessment of Borrower and Implementing Agencies’ performance, the rating for Overall
Borrower Performance is Moderately Satisfactory, owing to mainly the weaknesses in MEM’s
implementation capacity as well as delays in the second tariff adjustments and in procurement.

6. Lessons Learned
The lessons learned and key factors contributing to the extraordinary progress in national electrification in
Laos were recently reviewed by the World Bank in 2011 4. These high-level lessons are applicable to this
Project as part of the national electrification program and therefore summarized below:
      •   GoL has played an irreplaceable role in terms of making unwavering commitment, getting the
          policies right and staying the course. The government set clear targets for electricity access and
          developed an institutional framework and financing and monitoring mechanisms to ensure the
          achievement of the target in a timely and effective manner.
      •   EdL has been a key and keen facilitator and front line partner in implementing grid extension
          and roll-out programs, and makes them successful with effective leadership, sound planning,
          and efficient operations.
      •   Striking a workable balance among financing, subsidy and tariff policies by providing necessary
          state subsidies to rural electrification and at the same time maintaining the commercial viability
          of EdL with cost-recovery tariffs.
      •   Targeting the gender and extreme poverty dimension of rural electrification with the innovative
          P2P program.
      •   Complementing grid extension with off-grid options for remote rural areas where the grid
          cannot reach in the short term.
Other lessons germane to the Project include:
The importance of partnership cannot be overestimated for achieving the expected results of the
Project and the national electrification program. Given limited IDA allocations for Laos, the Project
drew partners of GEF, Norad, AusAID, ESMAP, PHRD and ASTAE during preparation and
implementation. The resultant co-financing and parallel financing was almost four times the IDA grant
amount, enabling the Project to exceed its original targets. Moreover, donor support is united in a single
program and operated based on the same operational guidelines, enabling maximum efficiency.

Continuous Bank engagement is essential to the lasting impact of Bank interventions. It takes much
longer than one project cycle to influence sector policies and institutional capacity building. Bank support
for the energy sector in Laos dates back to the late 1990s when EdL was still a relatively new company.
Over the last two decades, the Bank has consistently engaged in the energy sector in Laos and provided
financing and technical assistance for electrification as well as improving EdL’s financial performance
through five consecutive projects including the ongoing APL. The achievement made by the Project, with
particular regards to the power sector financial performance, would not be possible and sustainable
without such interventions.
Management of social and environmental impacts should be integrated into the regular operations
of the implementing agency. Compliance with environmental and social safeguards policies should not
be seen as a burden to the implementing agency and it is more organic to establish good practices for
managing environmental and social impacts in its regular operations through the implementation of Bank-
funded Project. REP I provided extensive safeguards training to both technical professionals and
managers to raise their awareness and knowledge. The P2P program provided an entry point to address
the gender dimensions of rural electrification, and EdL and MEM committed their own resources to scale
up the program.
Sustainability of the SHS program requires long-term attention and strategy beyond the Project life.
When installation, operation and maintenance of the SHS are outsourced to the private sector, the
implementing agency still carries the principal responsibility to ensure the sustainability of the SHS
program. There need to be clearly defined terms of reference and a proper compensation scheme for the
private sector as well as adequate monitoring and evaluations systems to ensure the SHS provides
electricity services as intended during and beyond the Project life. VOPS and other private service
providers should remain adequately funded until proven in-house management capacity in the MEM is
established. The SHS design needs to be reevaluated in view of the unprecedented success of the on-grid
extension and increased cost of services after installation and re-flow collection.
Implementation and update of the Rural Electrification (RE) Master Plan are as important as its
development. As there are multiple implementers of electrification projects at both national and
provincial levels, the Rural Electrification Master Plan and its database are useful tools for guiding
investments and assessing progress. It is necessary to maintain the Plan and the database up-to-date and
reconcile the Master Plan with the provincial cluster plans and the electrification projects implemented at
provincial level. Such updates should keep up with the fast pace of electrification. Only then can the RE
Master Plan provide real guidance in electrification planning.
Right strategy supported by right incentives is the backbone of off-grid expansion. Mass withdrawal
of SHSs at the end of REP1 brought about by rapid grid extension may have been avoidable if SHS
installation had been strategically implemented in areas where the grid would not arrive in five or more
years. It would cost more to install and maintain the systems. However, this cost could be managed if the
right incentives are designed. In addition, the SHS delivery model designed for a relatively low coverage
market could become obsolete when the electricity coverage reaches a high level, and as a result, warrants
rethinking and evaluation for its suitability.

Annex 2. OUTPUTS BY COMPONENT
The outputs of the two project components, executed respectively by EdL and MEM, are described below.
A. EdL Component
A.1 Grid Extension: A total of 2767 km distribution lines (1,724km of MV lines and 1,043km of LV
    lines) were built. Some 66,367 concrete poles were constructed and installed and 749 transformers
    were installed. Some 57,039 households were connected to the grid under REP I, including 18,535
    HHs under AusAID financing. A total of 570 villages have been connected to the grid.
     Although EDL has moved efficiently and effectively to procure materials and plan the works, one
     small detail at the design stage, has caused substantial delays in re-tending for materials. The
     conclusion is that WB funded projects with predefined tendering procedures for goods are
     vulnerable to the “minor details? if goods and services are tendered separately. Project preparation
     puts great pressure on the utility and “designs? are bound not to be perfect under the best managed
     utilities. Hence combined supply and installation projects should be encouraged for distribution
     works even if they are perceived to be marginally more expensive. They are more cost effective
     overall.
A.2 Loss Reduction: A Master Plan for Distribution Loss Reduction was undertaken in March 2007,
    and a report and plan were produced in December 2008. The report made recommendations on
    technical and non-technical loss reductions. EdL also purchased eight licenses of CYMDIST, the
    software for distribution loss analysis and conducted software training for EdL staff at headquarters
    and in four the provinces with the assistance of the Consultant. The Consultant also visited some of
    EdL’s branch offices and made recommendations on data collection for EdL use in CYMDIST.
     EdL implemented the loss reduction program using IDA resources from REP I and REP II as well as
     its own resources and established a loss reduction team in each of its branch offices in charge of
     planning, organizing and implementing the loss reduction program. Distribution losses have
     declined consistently in the last few years per the table below.
                       2004      2005       2006     2007       2008     2009          2010       2011
      Loss Ratio* (%) 18.81      19.32      17.86    15.83      13.17    11.98         10.78      10.45
     Source: ICR by EdL and MEM dated September 8, 2012.
     *Measured as kWh sent from substations to kWh paid for by EdL customers.
     Capacitor installation was undertaken over the distribution network according to modeling using the
     CYMDIST software. Analysis results revealed that Khammouane province MV losses were amongst
     the highest. Re-conductoring was undertaken to reduce losses. Commercial loss reduction activities
     were undertaken, which in conjunction with the technical measures, brought down the losses well
     below the 17% target to about 10.5%. Loss reduction teams were set up in all regions and
     consolidated in headquarters. Re-metering was undertaken on a pilot basis in Vientiane
     Municipality. Meter test benches were purchased and meter calibration of new meters (on a sample
     basis) as well as field meters was carried out. Further Non-Technical-Loss-Reduction exercises
     were initiated under REP II to complement loss reduction activities.
A.3 IT System: The equipment for a computerized accounting and financial management system was
    purchased under SPRE. However, due to limited IT support staff and lack of adequate IT equipment,
    only three modules were rolled out to EdL branch offices. Therefore it was agreed that the Bank
    would continue to support the IT system under REP in accordance with an agreed action plan. The
    development of a new Material Management and Procurement System was dropped from the Project
    due to lack of need. An action plan for financial sustainability of the power sector was developed in
    2005 and implemented during REP I.
     Some Virtual Private Network and servers were procured under REP II and are being used to
     support the current IT system of EDL which is under increased pressure associated with the increase
     of electrification and loss reduction.

A.4 Tariff Reform: Tariffs were adjusted in line with the agreed Action Plan for Financial
    Sustainability of the Power Sector developed in 2005 (see the Table below). A new tariff adjustment
    scheme was developed in 2009 in order to reach cost recovery tariffs and was approved by the GoL
    in December 2010; however, it was not implemented until March 2012.

A.5 Safeguards Capacity Building: A Social and Environmental Capacity Building Plan was
    developed, assessing the current capacity of staff in EdL and its branches, identifying their training
    needs, and estimating the budget needed to implement the Plan. Training in form of workshops and
    on-the-job training sessions was provided to the environment staff in EdL to implement the
    safeguards management frameworks. Additional training was provided to managerial and technical
    staff on environmental and social management in the form of training workshops and study tours.
    Monitoring and office equipment and supplies were purchased for the environmental management
    office of EdL and its branches.
A.6 DSM: A DSM Steering Committee was established in 2007, consisting of the Ministries of Finance,
    Public Works and Transport, Energy and Mines, Science and Technology, as well as Environment
    and Natural Resources. A DSM Unit was created within EdL in coordination with regional branches
    and reaches out to other departments of EdL as well as member ministries of the Steering
    Committee.      An energy end-use database was completed in 2007 and is available at:
    www.laodsm.net. Walk-through energy audits were carried out in 50 selected government buildings
    in 2007, the results of which formed the basis for the preparation of the Energy Efficiency Manual
    for the Public Sector. Low cost energy efficiency measures such as (i) replace standard ballasts with
    electronic or low loss magnetic ballasts; (ii) install dedicated light switches (pull-cord type) for
    fluorescent tube lighting; (iii) use of efficient light reflectors; (iv) use of timers to control the hours
    of operations, and (v) routine AC maintenance were implemented in four pilot buildings, showing
    significant energy savings. One percent (1%) loss reduction is equivalent to saving Lao Kip 19.5

     billion or US$2.44 million per annum 5 . Capacity building for the government employees and
     awareness campaigns aiming at employees in the public sector were conducted. EdL appointed ten
     energy coordinators to continue to implement EE activities in government buildings. Phase-two
     survey on implementation EE activities will be supported under REP II.
B. MEM Component
B.1 Off-grid Investment Program: The goal of REP I was to provide electrification by off-grid
    technologies to about 10,000 households in about 200 villages in 17 provinces, of which 10 percent
    used village hydro and diesel-based generation systems. Under the project 9,840 SHS were actually
    installed, of which 3,923 were withdrawn due to the arrival of the grid after installation. No village
    systems were built under REP I. Another 5,000 SHS were purchased and will be installed with REP
    II support. The SHS scheme was one of the pioneering schemes in the region with enthusiastic
    support from MEM and implementation started well. However due to the unprecedented success of
    on-grid rural electrification and the continued push by the national and local governments, SHS
    lost substantial ground, its impact is being reduced and MEM is urgently trying to redefine a moving
    target. It appears from the recent workshop on September 28, 2012 that the initial revolving fund
    scheme is no longer practicable. This is because SHS is being targeted to the most remote
    communities now, and as a result, recovery cost is becoming negative which renders the revolving
    fund unsustainable.
B.2 Institutional Strengthening: MEM outsourced the overall coordination, implementation and
    monitoring of the off-grid component to a contractor known as Village Off-grid Promotion and
    Support or VOPS with financial support from Norad. There was a void of 20 months near the end of
    REP I without a VOPS after the contract of the first VOPS expired in December 2009 and before the
    contract for the second VOPS signed in February 2012. The first VOPS selected local private
    companies (also known as Provincial Electricity Service Companies or PESCOs) to be responsible
    for installation and maintenance of SHSs and payment collection with the assistance of Village
    Electricity Managers (VEMs) in targeted villages. An incentive scheme was designed and
    implemented to reward good performance of the first VOPS and PESCOs. During implementation,
    the technical capacity and knowledge on off-grid electrification at MEM and provincial departments
    of energy and mines were also strengthened.
B.3 Alternative RE Delivery Models: Fifteen village hydro projects were identified but not
    implemented. The Project investigated alternative delivery models for village hydro, and with IFC
    support, developed a proposal for a private public partnership scheme, which aimed at promoting
    private participation in provision of alternative RE services . MEM is currently re-evaluating this
    scheme following a first round of interest from the stakeholders of the village hydro projects. The
    project carried out a biomass resource assessment including the potential for biogas technologies.
    Four biomass projects were found by the assessment, which are being tendered under REP II for
    development. Unlike other rural electrification projects, there was no activity related to the use of
    electricity for income generation was supported by the Project. The village hydro schemes were
    designed to become replicable and self-sustainable. However with the increase of on-grid
    electrification, the pressure to maintain uniform tariffs and the nonexistence of special and clear
    government policy or subsidy for renewable-based electrification delivery schemes this model will
    not replicable/sustainable. The first two projects under the IDA grant are about to be approved for
    tendering under REP II, and it will be of great interest to see the operational results of such projects.
B.4 RE Master Plan and Database: An RE master plan and a geo-referenced RE database were
    developed and related staff in MEM were trained to maintain and update the GIS database. An
    assessment of mini/micro hydro resources and rehabilitation of existing mini/micro hydro plants was
    completed. However, the RE development was not always referred to by the local authorities.

B.5 Sector Financing Strategy: A sector financing strategy and standard IPP concession contracts were
    prepared by the Department of Energy Business of MEM. The strategy is being used by the GoL to
    promote private sector participation in power generation. As results, many foreign and local
    investors participated in large and small scale projects respectively.
B.6 Organization Strengthening of IREP/MEM: Staff at IREP/MEM and provincial departments of
    energy and mines participated in safeguards training, study tours, and English language training.
    PMU/IREP was maintained and functional throughout the Project.

Annex 3. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS

I.          Project Economic and Financial Analyses

This section comprises the economic and financial analyses of: (i) the grid extension component under
EdL, and (ii) the off-grid SHS component under MEM.
A. Grid Extension under EdL
a. Methodology adjustment – benefits of grid-based electricity supply
At appraisal, the economic analysis assumed a linear demand curve for lighting (See Approach I in table
1). A problematic implication of this assumption is that demand elasticity increases as the price level
rises, resulting in a significant overestimate of project benefits. At the appraisal of REP II, the shape of
the demand curve was adjusted to a more realistic concave shape with three linear segments defined by
four price-and-consumption points identified through a consumer survey (See Approach II in table 1).
This adjustment results in a nearly two-thirds decrease in the estimated consumer surplus. Following the
recommended approach by IEG (2008) 6, this analysis makes a further adjustment to the shape of the
demand curve to log-linear, implying constant demand elasticity throughout the entire price range. This
adjustment results in a further four-fifths reduction in the estimated consumer surplus of grid-based
lighting (See Approach III in table 1). Using the same approach, this analysis also estimates the consumer
benefits of grid-based electricity consumption for the use of radios and TVs (See table2).

    c. Results of Economic Analysis
At a 10 percent discount rate, the economic benefit of the grid extension component is estimated at a net
present value (NPV) of US$36.3 million at project completion compared with an estimated US$280.8
million at appraisal. The difference is primarily due to the above mentioned change from a linear to a
more realistic log-linear or constant-elastic demand curve for lighting. This change results in a US$264.5
million downward adjustment in NPV over the lifetime of the project. Other factors, such as expansion of
project scope, and local currency appreciation, in combination result in a net increase of US$20.0
million in NPV.

    Calculated based on the consumer surplus estimate. At appraisal, willingness-to-pay for radio and TV was not assessed.
(4)
    At appraisal, only the consumer surplus from lighting was considered in the calculation of the economic benefit of the project. The benefits of other uses of electricity were not
included even though they were assessed. This is likely because the estimated benefit of lighting at appraisal far outweighed the benefits of other uses of electricity.

    d. Economic analysis sensitivity
The willingness-to-pay (WTP) for lighting, radio and TV are estimated at 5,212 kip/kWh, 7,666/kWh and
2,817 kip/kWh respectively (See table 2). Moreover, the 2004 survey data suggest that each household
consumes around 22 kWh on lighting, listening to the radio and watching TV per month. For the
remaining electricity consumption, such as for household cooking, refrigeration, agricultural irrigation,
industrial and commercial uses, etc., the WTP is conservatively assumed at the weighted average
domestic tariff of 2011-12 at 859 kip/kWh (US$0.107/kWh). A sensitivity analysis suggests that the
economic return of the project is highly sensitive to the assumed WTP for electricity consumption for
purposes other than lighting, radio and TV – every 1 US cent/kWh increase in WTP will result in about
US$8.6 million increase in the project NPV (See Figures 1a and 1b).

               e. Financial analysis results
At a 10 percent WACC, the financial NPV (FNPV) of the grid extension component is about US$13.6
million under the agreed subsidy arrangements and tariff regime at completion compared with an
estimated US$6.4 million at appraisal. The difference is primarily due to the increased scope of the
project with additional financing from AusAID.

    f.   Financial analysis sensitivities
The project FNPV is highly sensitive to EdL’s WACC. The FNPV of the base case scenario would
increase to US$35.3 million with a WACC at 6 percent compared with US$13.6 million with a 10 percent
WACC (see figure 2).

B. Off-grid SHS under MEM
   a. Methodology revision
At appraisal, the WTP for SHS-based lighting only took into account the consumer surplus while omitting
the household current payment for SHS-based lighting, which ranges between US$22 and US$32 per
household annually in 2006 dollars. This omission resulted in an underestimation of between US$80 and
US$121 per system in NPV through the life of the project.

    a. Results of economic analysis
The economic benefits of SHS are estimated to range between US$39 and US$84 per system at project
completion, compared with a range between US$84 to US$109 at appraisal. Two factors are the primary
contributors to the change: (i) an increase of upfront costs by between US$111 and US$174 per system;
and (ii) the above mentioned correction in the methodology for WTP calculation, which results in an
upward adjustment between US$80 and US$121 per system in NPV.

    b. Economic analysis sensitivities
The economic return of a SHS is sensitive to the system’s lifespan and the average daily operating hours.
A 30-50 Wp system operating on average four hours a day would have to last more than 3.5 years to
break even economically. Similarly, a 30-50 Wp system with a lifespan of five years would have to
operate on average more than three hours a day in order to break even (See figure 3a and 3b below).

     c. Financial analysis results

The FNPV of SHS is estimated to range between US$8 and US$114 per system at project completion
compared with an estimated range between US$7 and US$35 per system at appraisal. The difference is
primarily due to: (i) an increase of upfront costs between US$111 and US$174 per system; and (ii)
changes in the household repayment schedule from five to 10 years, and (iii) appreciation of local
currency LAK against US dollar.

* Project file suggests that the estimated IRR levels were incorrectly recorded at appraisal. The recorded values were off by two
digits. The actual estimates should be 480%, 630%, 850% and 2276% for 20-50 WP systems respectively.
     II.         EdL Financial Performance
     A. Covenant Compliance
At appraisal, EdL was able to generate sufficient cash from its operations to meet the three covenanted
financial obligations associated with the IDA credits: (i) a self-financing ratio of no less than 30 percent;
(ii) a long-term debt to equity ratio of no more than 1.5; and iii) a debt service coverage ratio no less than
1.5.
Table 6. Summary of EdL Covenant Compliance Status (2006-11)
                                                             2006      2007       2008      2009       2010         2011

In the period 2006-10, EdL had continued fulfilling its covenanted financial obligation regarding debt-to-
equity ratio and debt service coverage ratio. In 2011, the company’s debt service coverage ratio fell
below the covenanted 1.5 due to the narrow operating margin that year. Moreover, EdL did not meet the
4 percent rate of return on revaluated asset target at project completion largely due to the same reason.


                                                               39
Since 2009, EdL has been in breach of the self-financing ratio covenant as a result of: (i) rising
investment levels and (ii) narrowing operating margin (See figure 4).

In the period 2006-11, EdL had made notable improvements in two areas: (i) distribution loss reduction,
in part due to the investments from REP I; and (ii) reductions in days of accounts receivables among non-
government customers.

However, EdL’s liquidity position has been deteriorating since 2006. Following the spin-off of EdL Gen
in 2010, EdL, the parent company, experienced a sharp fall in its operating margin. In 2011, EdL Gen
became one of the first two companies going public in the newly established Laotian Stock Exchange.
The generation price included in the power purchase agreement between EdL Gen and EdL has shown to
be well above the previous internal transfer price between EdL’s generation unit and its transmission and
distribution units. As a result, EdL suffered an operating loss in 2010, the first time in more than a decade.
In order for EdL to have broken even operationally that year, its domestic end-user tariff would have to
have been 22 percent higher.

    C. EdL Financial Projections (2012-16)
Going forward, EdL is expected to experience a fundamental shift in its business model from operational-
profit-driven to investment-dividend-driven. Caught between a high PPA tariff on the generation side and
the fully regulated retail tariff on the demand side, EdL is bound to experience razor-thin operating
margins even if the tariff schedule manages to keep up with the cost of supply. Given the tariff increase
has already fallen behind schedule, EdL will likely suffer operating losses in the short to medium term
while putting its bottom line fully dependent on the dividend payouts from EdL Gen and the IPPs where it
has equity ownership.
Preliminary financial projections of EdL suggest the company will face considerable challenges fulfilling
all three of its covenanted financial obligations in the coming years that were set before the spin-off of the
EdL-GEN.

Annex 6. STAKEHOLDER WORKSHOP REPORT AND RESULTS

A stakeholder workshop took place in Vientiane, the capital of Lao PDR, on September 28, 2012, in the
Mercure Hotel. Around 70 people participated in the workshop, including representatives from EdL
headquarters and its provincial branches, MEM/IREP, Provincial Departments of Energy and Mines,
Village Energy Managers, and PESCOs, household beneficiaries of the SHS program, REP II VOPS, the
NGO Lao Institute of Renewable Energy, project suppliers (Sunlabob Co., Lao Enterprise and Partners
Co. and Sengsavang Co. Ltd), Helvetas (the Swiss Inter-cooperation Agency), AusAID and the World
Bank. Participants expressed their views on achievements and impact made by the Project, lessons learnt,
and areas for improvement especially in relation to the off-grid component.
Opening remarks by the Institute of Renewable Energy Promotion Director General, Mr. Hatsady
    -   A family without electricity cannot be taken out of poverty
    -   SHS program is a decentralized top-down program
    -   The Government of Lao PDR gives a great value to the WB support on the way of funds and
        human resources development
    -   Success of the Government policy. “When there is a clear, realistic but ambitious target, things
        work?.
    -   One of the challenges is having a common understanding among all the stakeholders. It is not
        appropriate if the grid is extended faster than expected driven by the villagers and provincial
        governments and donors complain that the planning is not followed.
    -   Rural electrification sector meetings like this one will be taking place on a regular basis.

      including MEM and EdL (example: efficient air conditioning
      appliances)
SHS beneficiary and VEM, Khammouane Province
   - Beneficiaries do not understand the potential and limitations
      of the SHS, “they do not understand that 20W is only for
      lighting 2 bulbs?
   -   “still better than using candles?

PESCO, Saravan Province
   - Systems do not work after 5 years
   - Beneficiaries only interested in SHS of a larger size
Ms. Xiaoping Wang, Senior Energy Specialist, WB                     -   Planning and
   - Having seeing a very encouraging picture in the field , access     implementation is
       to electricity changes people’s life not only in terms of        decentralized now
       meeting basic daily needs but also increases in income

   -   There is much room for promoting income generation -              Yes, more income
       activities, since the actual consumption in grid extension        generation promotion
       areas is as low as 40-80 kWh per month. This would be a           in the electrified
       win-win for EdL and the beneficiaries since it will bring up      villages is needed
       the consumption and bring prosperity and development to the
       communities
   -   Coordination among on-grid and off-grid is a challenge. 50%
       of the SHS have been withdrawn in the Bolikamxay
       Province. The cost of re-deploying these retrieved systems is
       expected to be significant since only solar panels are
       withdrawn.
   -   Spare parts should be made available to the users. It seems

   - There is potential for SHS but the collection of repayments
      by the PESCO is too complicated since there are no access
      roads

      implementation. The implementation of grid extension electricity grid
      sometimes overlaps between PDEM and EdL and this development. “It does

REP II VOPS
The expressed issues have been pending for a long time. We are
taking stock of these issues related to off-grid electrification and
working on potential solutions
Mr. Makathy Tep, Environmental Safeguards Specialist, WB
Consultant
    - Good job done by EdL branches and IREP on safeguards
        compliance
   -   The consultation must be a two-way communication
EdL branch, Champasack
   - P2P has been a very good way to facilitating access to the
      grid

  Mr. Vongvilay Sisoulath, Deputy Manager, Environmental and
  Social Office of EdL
     - More staff is needed in the environmental and social offices
          at the EdL branches
      -    The staff has to be more rigorous with the forms
  Summary of the points raised during the workshop by the WB REP I TTL, Mr. Veasna Bun
      •    Strong commitment is needed on off-grid electrification
      •    Need to review/revise the SHS hire-purchase delivery model
      •    Import tax exemption on renewable energies goods is needed. The WB engaged in a similar
           policy dialogue in Cambodia and the legal reform took place at the end of 2009. Further
           discussion on this is needed in Laos
      •    Need to put more effort on energy efficiency
      •    Concerns of users: need to improve the consultation with prospective SHS users on the size of the
           SHS, potential uses of the electricity generated by SHS, and the life time of the battery.

Annex 7. SUMMARY OF BORROWER'S ICR AND/OR COMMENTS ON DRAFT ICR

The Borrower submitted its ICR of the Project to the Bank on September 6, 2012. The report is on project
file. The Borrower’s ICR was more than 10 pages long. However, it was incomplete in many of the
evaluation sections required and was mainly focused on processes and outputs. The lessons learned
discussed in the Borrower’s ICR are deemed to have added values in addition to the description of
processes and outputs and are summarized below.
   1. EdL
Negative environmental and social impacts resulting from the project are considered to be minor.
Environmental and social safeguard policies were well prepared and implemented to minimize the
negative impact during project implementation. It is recommended that the Environment Office (EO) in
cooperation with the EDL Branch Offices including Project Implementation Units (PIUs), Environmental
Management Units (EMU) and related stakeholders should take into account the following in
implementing REP II ;
   •    In order for the project to be managed effectively, a clear work plan to be developed and shared
        among the EO, the EMUs in the EDL Branch Offices, the PIU at HQ and the PIUs in the EDL
        Branch Offices.
   •    Office Resources and Equipment: In the EDL Branch offices, office resources and equipment are
        in limited numbers and have to be shared among different sections. Thus this limitation is
        restricting the work of the EMU and progression of the project. In order to effectively share the
        limited resources and equipment, work schedule at the office need to be well coordinated among
        the EMUs and the PIU.
   •    Recording: The following items need to be paid special attention;
        -        The progress of the project need to be documented and the information need to be shared
                 among all stakeholders.
        -        Signatures of both village heads and affected households need to be collected in the
                 compensation agreement sheet.
        -        It is preferable to collect not only the signature from village administration staff but also
                 signatures of all participated villagers at the consultation meetings.
        -        Photos need to be taken at the consultation meeting as a record.
   •    Letters on Consultation Meeting: In order for the villagers to be duly informed of the date of the
        consultation meeting, the letters to inform the date of meeting need to be sent and reached the
        villagers at least one week before the meeting.
   •    Clarification of Ethnic Minority Group. At the time of consultation meeting information
        regarding the name of ethnic group, number of ethnic group households and their level of
        communication skills need to be inquired and recorded.
   •    Compensation Standard and Evaluation of Affected Assets. Basis of compensation standard on
        affected assets needs to be disclosed and evaluation for the affected assets needs to be duly
        recorded.
   •    In-kind compensation. Effort to match the needs from community and type of in-kind
        compensation should be made. The choice of in-kind compensation shall not be limited to the
        present choices such as free connection to the community temple or to school located in the
        project affected village.
    •   Safeguard policy on ethnic people faced communication problems because of the degree of
        understanding of official language by ethnic people. An interpreter (usually the village head) shall
        be arranged in the consultation meetings in order for villagers to participate and comprehend the
        project thoroughly.
Cooperation with other development organizations. Presently there are many government-led
development projects in rural areas. However, the collaboration with other governmental agencies has

                                                     51
not yet realized. With the cooperation of local government at district level, it is recommended to make an
arrangement for meeting on needs of targeted villages between on-going development projects and REP II.
This kind of arrangement will enhance targeted villages’ social and economic development so as to
amplify the affordability of electricity.
Delay in the financial arrangement from other donors (Norad and AusAID) caused delay in the
implementation of Grid extension. For future project, timely arrangement for financing is needed in order
to complete the project in time.
Investments in loss reduction are effective. Enhanced measures including power system analysis software
CYMEDIST and hardware and project evaluation technologies for reducing technical losses have been
introduced in REPI project. For more efficient implementation of loss reduction programs, CYMEDIST
modeling and power demand data collection should be continued to cover the remaining areas. Further,
CYMEDIST modeling which have been carried out in the REPI project shall be updated in regular
intervals.
IT system have been developed during the project by procurement of AFMS in SPRE and REPI project,
and 12 provinces in total have already equipped with the above system and for the rest of the provinces it
would be done in a later stage. However, due to the limited number of IT staff, it is not sufficient to
support the users for day-to-day activities. Training of EdL staff for operating IT system and equipment,
especially in Branch offices, is strongly required to support the IT system improvement of EdL.
    2. MEM/IREP
IREP has fully gained experiences in management the off-grid rural electrification project in the supply
chain cycle starting from procurement, delivery of equipment, stock and supply of spare part and some
activities were outsourced to accelerate the implementation of the project and to exchange some expertise
with the outsourcing firm experts.
IREP has developed a business model which attracted private firms or companies to come in this business
as PESCOs. Because it generates income to PESCOs and can also provide other business in this area such
as an electric appliances shop, electric supply and wiring shop, etc., this will strengthen the domestic
private firms to be investors in the renewable energy business in Lao PDR.
IREP has set up various incentives measures to encourage the implementation of SHS, VHS, and GS in
the remote off-grid electrification project for example Guideline of Incentives for enhancing private firms
in implementation REP project, setting up Rural Electrification Fund for supporting IREP/MEM, PDEM
staff in in daily operation by collecting incomes from customers payment on utilization of SHS in hire-
purchase basis. These measures are still employed for implementing the next phase of rural electrification
in Lao PDR.
IREP has gained experiences in enhancing private sector to participate in the energy business with public
and private partnership (PPP) model and learned how to modify the PPP model to be properly and
efficiently applied with the Lao economy situation.

Annex 8. COMMENTS OF CO-FINANCIERS AND OTHER PARTNERS/ STAKEHOLDERS

•   Comments from Norad: None
•   Comment from AusAID:

A couple of comments and lessons learned (see below) in writing from the AusAID (co-financier) were
received on January 29, 2013. The comments included that:
    -   The need to revisit the target indicators of AusAID financing.
    -   More elaboration of delays of ICB bidding for AusAID-supported off-grid activities (SHS
        purchase) was needed.
    -   Little progress of development of the SHS withdrawal guidelines under REP I. Attention to the
        matter is needed under REP II.
    -   Delays of the AusAID-financed activities for the off-grid component (SHS) due to procurement
        delays and limited capacity of the DOE.
All comments were incorporated in this ICR.
Lessons learned shared by the AusAID included.
Partnership approach: It is noted that partnership approach not only enhanced aid effectiveness in terms
of fulfilling financial gaps but also increased mutual learning on quality of the project implementation.
AusAID joined in the implementation support mission since 2009 until the Implementation Completion
and Results mission in October 2012. This involvement has provided good lessons learned on
understanding the complexity of financial agreement arrangements of the project. We also learned that a
part from joint implementation mission undertaken twice a year, on-going support and prompt advice
from the Bank to the executing agencies are critical for project success.
Delay in processing the Grant Agreement under AusAID Trust Fund Agreement between GoL and WB.
Trust Fund Agreement between AusAID and the WB was signed in May 2009 but actual disbursement
from the WB to the recipient was done more than a year later. There were many reasons that caused the
delays but this affected not only on the project implementation but also decreasing the trust of the target
communities who were awaiting support from the project.
Procurement issues: During the project implementation, AusAID was approached by one disqualified
bidder complaining that the on-grid procurement process was not fair. In November 2012, a mission
confirmed that there were two unsuccessful bidders that complained on the SHS and micro hydro PPP
procurement. While we noted that those bidders did not meet the eligible criteria, we learned that there
should have been a bidder clarification meeting jointly held by the World Bank. This is done to ensure
that the bidding is conducted in a transparent manner.
Capacity of Executing Agencies: While we noticed that knowledge of DoE/IREP has increased
significantly in terms of technical and project management skill including procurement (ICB, NCB),
chronic delays kept happening over the last 6 missions under the off-grid component. Thus, adequate
institutional needs assessment should be done during project preparatory phase to understand the real
status of the executing agency’s capacity.
