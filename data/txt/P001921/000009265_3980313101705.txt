Block 1: Project Description
1. Project development objectives (see Annex I for key performance indicators): The proposed project will address severe
wastewater pollution from heavily urbanized areas of Port Louis, targeting the city's southern districts, industrial zones
and affected coastal zones. The main objectives are to: (i) improve the health and sanitary conditions of the populations
in these areas; (ii) reverse the current trend of environmental pollution on the island and in its coastal zone; and (iii)
support Government efforts to implement priority institutional and technical measures identified in the Sewerage Master
Plan.

3. Benefits and target population: The project is expected to mitigate the risk of water-borne disease epidemics (notably
hepatitis A), which, if not addressed, will impose substantial direct and indirect costs on the tourism and export
industries. The project will also have a direct impact on human health by protecting potable, irrigation, and marine water
resources from industrial and household wastewater pollution, and eliminating sewer back-ups and overflows. Sound
public sector management of wastewater will benefit the country as a whole; the Montagne Jacquot component will
directly improve the living conditions of a concentrated urban population in Port Louis. The project is expected to
protect the vulnerable water resources of the Port Louis Lagc on, in addition to the marine and coastal ecosystems of Port
Louis and the northwest shore. Treatment and future reuse of urban wastewater for irrigation will benefit agriculture and
conserve potable water resources. Industry will be encouraged to utilize clean technologies, and to operate in an
environmentally sound manner. The project will contribute to reducing the costs of cleaning up pollution and will
generate revenues to sustain wastewater services.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Implementation period: FY98-FY03 (6 years), to correspond to GOM absorptive capacity for all projects in the
National Sewerage Program (NSP).
Executing ageney: The Waste Water Authority
Project coordination: WWA, assisted by external consultants, will be responsible for project implementation and
coordination with other projects in the NSP. WWA will coordinate tariff collection with the Central
Water Authority (CWA). The Steering Committee (see below) will ensure donor and overall NSP
coordination.
Project oversight (policy guidance. etc.): Steering Committee, chaired by the Ministry of Economic Development and
Regional Cooperation (MEDRC) and comprising high-level officials from MEDRC, MPU, Ministry
of Finance (MOF), and the Ministry of Local Government and Environment (MLGE).
Implementation arrangements: WWA will be the project implementing agency. A "contract of delegation" between
the GOM and the WWA will confer on WWA the function of "maitre d'ouvrage delegue" for wastewater sector
management and will specify the relative roles and responsibilities of WWA and MPU (see Project Implementation
Plan). A Steering Committee, chaired by MEDRC and comprising officials of MEDRC, MOF, MPU and MLGE, will
oversee NSP and the project to ensure coordination and timely implementation of necessary sector policy
development and reform. On a larger scale, the Steering Committee will ensure national interagency coordination and
coordination between all donor-funded activities in the NSP.
Cofinancing arrangements: The Japanese Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) will provide parallel
financing. OECF has committed to financing construction of the Montagne Jacquot treatment plant, the two pumping
stations and the sea outfall. The Bank has financed preparatory studies and design work, and will finance the
transmission and rising mains and the institutional strengthening component. OECF components will be subject to
OECF procurement guidelines, while the Bank-financed components will following Bank procurement guidelines.
There are no major incompatibilities between the Bank and OECF guidelines.
Physical component: Final engineering and design work for the Montagne Jacquot system will be completed by the
WWA before Board presentation (February 12, 1998), with assistance from internationally-selected consultants
financed under a PHRD Grant. Prequalification and bids will be coordinated to minimize start-up delay and to enable
award of contract upon effectiveness. WWA will acquire the land and rights of way for construction and will manage
construction of the Montagne Jacquot system through contracts with consultants, selected according to International
Competitive Bidding. The project will be implemented in five and a half years, completed by December 31, 2002 and
closed on June 30, 2003.
Sector equipment and expertise: The WWA is responsible for engaging the expertise and procuring equipment,
defining study terms of reference, managing implementation of the studies and proposing sector legislation and
reforms based on study results. Expertise will include provision of and training in software to support the new billing
arrangements with CWA. Sewage sector reforms, the cost recovery system and institutional restructuring of WWA
for its future role will require actions by the GOM as a whole and by other national institutions involved in the sector.
The Ministry of Public Utilities will ultimately be responsible for making changes in sector policy, particularly those
that lead to integration of water and wastewater sector management. Wastewater sector reforms will be carried out in
a consistent and coordinated manner with the reforms planned for the other utilities, e.g. reform of the water sector
and the CWA (particularly those relating to tariffs and the cost recovery system) and establishment of a utilities
investment corporation to hold the assets of the water, wastewater and electricity sectors. The Steering Committee is
to ensure coordination between reforms in the wastewater sector and other related sectors (such as environment,
regional administration, industry, etc.). The MPU, through WWA, will take the lead in designing and launching the
public awareness campaign on water and wastewater sector issues, including the National Connection Program, new
tariffs and the implementation of the NSP. The WWA will procure equipment (water meters), in consultation with
CWA, in support of the joint billing with the CWA.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements (continued):
Institution-building component: WWA will be responsible for the institutional strengthening component and for
ensuring implementation of staff training and timely input of appropriate technical expertise as defined in the Project
Implementation Plan. Critical activities are addressed in the Institutional Action Plan, integrated into the Project
Implementation Plan with detailed performance indicators as part of project conditions, and was finalized and agreed
on during negotiations. WWA, with the assistance of PHRD-financed consultants, will develop and propose
arnendments to existing sectoral legislation, and work with MLGE and MEDRC to draft and enact necessary
intersectoral legislation. WWA, assisted by technical assistance, will be responsible for negotiating an agreement
with industry on pretreatment standards and methods, and will oversee compliance.
Cost recovery arrangements: Cost recovery will be implemented by the WWA in concert with CWA: a sewerage
tariff is to be introduced July 1, 1998, as a surcharge to the water tariff corresponding to the amount of water used.
The exact tariff level, structure and periodic revision over the project life were finalized prior to and agreed upon
during negotiations. Revenues will be collected by the CWA and the sewerage surcharge transferred to the WWA.
Industrial compliance with pretreatment standards (set by the MLGE) will be monitored by the MLGE and reported to
WWA; WWA will be responsible for monitoring industrial contribution to pretreatment, and imposing penalties for
noncompliance.
Procurement: Works wholly or partly funded by IBRD will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (published January 1995; revised January and August 1996).
Consultancy services wholly or partly financed by IBRD will be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997). The Borrower's
procurement regulations and procedures have been reviewed and found acceptable. Before negotiations, a General
Procurement Noticewas prepared by WWA and transmitted to IBRD for publication in the United Nations
Development Business (UNDB) to advertise all assignments expected to be financed by IBRD under the project.
WWA will use Standard Bidding Documents published by the Bank for preparation of bidding and prequalification
documents for works to be procured under International Competitive Bidding (ICB), and for Requests for Proposals
and consulting service contracts. Detailed project procurement arrangements are given in Annex 6.
Accounting. financial reporting and auditing arrangements: Under the project, WWA will implement (before June
30,1999) a cost accounting system tracing the cost of the various services, including depreciation, the cost of capital
and other common costs, and associated revenues, to provide a full basis for cost recovery and tariff policy. WWA
will keep separate project accounts together with their statutory financial statements. Content of terms of reference
for the annual audits of the project accounts was agreed upon at negotiations. Auditing will be carried out by
independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and the reports of such audits will be submitted to the Bank no later than
six month after the end of the Borrower's fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Supervision. The Bank will devote some 80 staff weeks for supervision of
loan progress through FY2003. During the first three years, supervision will focus on progress towards achieving
specific objectives such as works, implementation of WWA institutional action plan, tariffs and cost-recovery targets,
implementation of the industrial waste management program and the performance of involved agencies. Particular
attention would be given during supervision and project reviews to implementation of the national sewerage
connections program, including execution of the reticulation system, WWA staffing, implementation of the WWA
training program and the operation and financial performance of the WWA. In addition, effluent quality monitoring
will be carefully monitored (particularly industrial effluent) to ensure compliance with quality standards.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements (continued):
Monitoring: Overall project monitoring will be based on indicators confirmed during appraisal and the Project
Implementation Plan which was finalized by the Borrower and agreed on during negotiations. Monitoring will be
carried out by the Steering Committee, chaired by MEDRC, and assisted by consultants as necessary. Progress under
each project component and the Institutional Action Plan will be monitored and coordinated by WWA under the
guidance of the Steering Committee. Progress reports will be prepared by WWA every six months and submitted to
the Bank within one month thereafter. No later than three months after completion of the project, GOM will prepare
and furnish to the Bank a report on the execution of the project, its costs and the benefits derived and to be derived
from it.
Mid-term review: A Mid-term Review will be carried out in June 1999 by the Bank, together with GOM and OECF. In
addition to covering all areas included in annual reviews, the Mid-term Review will assess the implementation status
of the National Sewerage Program, the various sectoral studies, degree of implementation of policy reforms,
institutional arrangements, tariffs and the cost-recovery system, the regulatory framework, private sector participation
and evolution of the role of WWA in the sector. Prior to the Mid-term Review, WWA will contract a consulting firm
(under project finance) to review and assess the progress of NSP and WWA restructuring, conduct a study on water
and sanitation sectors and prepare the necessary documentation for the Review. In particular, the Review will
consider and discuss the results of the following studies and reports: (i) review of past performance and
implementation of the NSP in general, and the Montagne Jacquot project in particular; (ii) review of
recommendations and proposals of the study on public utilities (water, wastewater and electricity sectors), including a
5-10 year action plan to implement recommendations; and (iii) review of the project implementation plan (PIP) and
recommendations for updating/amending the PIP for the remainder of project implementation. It is expected that the
Mid-term Review will result in determination of a general framework for future integrated water and sanitation sector
policy and development, which will in turn guide reforms of policies and institutions in the two sectors and related
sectors. At this time, the technical and financial viability of the proposed Utilities Investment Corporation, Ltd will be
reviewed and evaluated.
Block 2: Project Rationale
5. CAS objective(s) supported by the project Document number and date of latest CAS discussion: Report No. 16426, April 22,
1997
The proposed project supports the CAS objective to safeguard the environment through better strategic planning and
wastewater management. The project focuses on this latter, and as part of the Government's National Sewerage
Program, fits well within the sector strategy developed with broad public participation and consultation.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~......................................................................................................................................................................I........... ..............................................
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
High urbanization (40%) and economic growth have led to municipal and industrialpollution at a level that threatens
human and environmental health. The 1990 National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP), prepared with Bank
assistance, identified inadequate disposal of urban wastewater as a growing threat to the quality of underground water
resources, and marine and coastal zone ecosystems. Existing wastewater infrastructure does not handle effluent in an
environmentally sound manner. An increase in maintenance resources is needed to strengthen infrastructure
performance. The NEAP also identified a the need to strengthlen and coordinate the institutionalframework, and
clarify and enforce legislation to overcome problems in the sector. Based on the recommendations of the NEAP, the
GOM developed a Sewerage Master Plan (SMP) in 1992, and the related National Sewerage Program, of which the
proposed project is an integral part. Institutional studies of both the water and wastewater sectors have noted the
growing imbalance between the water and wastewater sectors, in terms of infrastructure, management and cost
recovery (for example, water services are currently available to 90% of the population, while the public sanitation
network covers only 18%). The GOM strategy is to reduce these imbalances and

Country: Mauritius                                                        Project Title: Environmental Sewerage and Sanitation
6. Main sector issues and Government strategy continued:
ultimately move the sectors toward closer coordination and integration by increasing sewerage infrastructure,
connections and treatment, reforming water and wastewater institutions and legislation, and integrating cost-recovery
measures. Although the GOM will reform and increase sewerage tariffs to cover recurrent costs, depreciation and
contribute to debt service, it is committed to maintaining affordability for service.
7. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
The project will provide needed wastewater infrastructure in Montagne Jacquot, one of the priority regions defined in
the Sewerage Master Plan. The project will also address institutional and regulatory weaknesses by providing support
to the newly established (March 1996) WWA, and providing a coherent framework for interagency coordination in sector
management and policy development. A new WWA Act, slated for promulgation in 1998, will replace earlier legislation
and effect restructuring of WWA as "maitre d'ouvrage delegue" and enable closer coordination among the water,
wastewater and environment sectors. Legislative reforms in related sectors will be coordinated by the Steering
Committee. This alternative was chosen as being simpler than simultaneously revising the myriad wastewater and
intersectoral legislations. Since private sector capacity is not well established in Mauritius, the project willfacilitate
involvement of the private sector by strengthening the WWA to plan infrastructure investments and manage wastewater
service contracts, and package works and O&M contracts to correspond to private sector capacity. The project
introduces cost-recovery mechanisms as a means of generating maintenance resources, and economic
incentives/disincentives for industrial compliance with environmental standards to reduce the cost of wastewater
treatment and disposal. The wastewater tariffs to be introduced in July 1998 respect the GOM's commitment to
affordability of service, and therefore increase gradually and do not fully cover cost of service provision (they will
gradually come to cover recurrent costs, depreciation and will contribute to debt service). Given the imbalances between
the water and wastewater sectors, it was decided to move gradually towards integration of the sectors. As noted above,
the proposed WWA Act will enable better coordination with the water and Wastewater tariffs will be determined as a
percentage of metered water consumption (subject to affordability criteria for domestic consumers), and will be jointly
billed and collected by CWA with the water bills. Although not currently planned, the project could be expanded in the
future to include a component for reuse of treated urban and industrial wastewater in agricultural irrigation as a means of
preserving potable water resources. environment sectors. Finally, in preparation for the Mid-term Review, a study will
be conducted on the water and wastewater sectors and will generate a framework, recommendations and an action plan
for integrated management of the two sectors. The Mid-term Review will futher review the results of the study on public
utilities and will evaluate the financial and technical viability of the proposed Utility Investment Corporation, Ltd.
.......................~~~~~~~~~~~....................................................................................................................................................................................................
8. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
1. The immediate involvement of the private sector to provide and manage wastewater services was rejected due to the
initial need to: (i) establish a coherent national framework within which the private sector could operate; (ii) determine
and enforce environmental regulations; (iii) strengthen WWA capacity to plan and manage infrastructure investments;
and (iv) allow local private sector capacity to develop. Once these have been achieved through the project, more
responsibility may devolve to the private sector through construction, service and/or maintenance contracts.
2. Three main alternatives were under consideration for design of the Montagne Jacquot sewerage system: (i) primary
wastewater treatment with sea outfall disposal (100 m deep); (ii) secondary treatment with sea outfall (30 m deep); and
(iii) tertiary treatment with reuse and sea outfall disposal. The appropriate technology has been chosen through updating
of the preparatory feasibility study with further site investigations and analyses and consultations with experts and is
reflected in the detailed system design. Based on these studies, an amended alternative (i) has been chosen (as
recommended by the consultants and accepted by GOM), given current needs, relative costs, and social acceptability of
wastewater reuse. The new alternative proposes pretreatment of industrial effluent, primary wastewater treatment with
disinfection, and sea outfall disposal of only 30m deep. In future, as resources and social acceptance grow, treatment and
infrastructure may be upgraded progressively to allow use of option (iii).

10. Lessons learned and reflected in the proj ect desig n: -.-.-.-. ............
Given the number of donor-financed sewerage projects within the National Sewerage Program, there is a needfor tight
coordination among the GOM and all donors. The project falls within a clearly defined master plan, and includes a
Steering Committee to ensure coordination among GOM agencies and donors, and implementation of the sector policies.
The project addresses the limited absorptive and implementation capacity of the WWA through an institutional
strengthening component and investment phasing. Institutional strengthening consists of providing necessary technical
assistance to the WWA and in training and assisting WWA to play its future role of planning and programming sector
activities, contracting out and managing the contracts, and monitoring the related quality of environment. Investments in
works and equipment will be phased according to local implementation and financial capacity. Extensive preparatory
studies address the need to adopt environmentally sound technology in project design. The project incorporates cost-
recovery mechanisms (user fees, treated wastewater reuse, industrial wastewater pretreatment, economic incentives) to
ensure financial sustainability. In addition, tender documents are to be ready before project effectiveness so as to
facilitate implementation.
...................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
11. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership:
The GOM has shown steady commitment to developing and applying sound environmental policy. Following the 1990
NEAP, the GOM developed a Sewerage Master Plan to define programs to provide long-term solutions for the safe
disposal of household and industrial liquid waste. This plan resulted in the National Sewerage Program which is being
implemented with donor support. Following the recommendations of the SMP, the GOM created the Waste Water
Authority, in March 1996, as an autonomous agency within the Ministry of Energy and Water Resources. The August
1997 government reorganization consolidated infrastructure agencies (including the WWA) within the new Ministry of
Public Utilities, facilitating interagency coordination. The WWA is to be restructured through a new Act to enable it to
play its new role as "maitre d'ouvrage delegue" and to facilitate private sector involvement, with support from the
proposed operation. To this end, the GOM is drafting the new WWA Act and has drafted and submitted to Parliament
the Sector Policy Letter. The GOM has also committed to revising and applying wastewater tariffs to improve cost
recovery. The GOM has also taken the initiative in reforming the public utility sectors (including the wastewater sector)
by proposing to create a utility investment corporation to manage the investments for all utilities (water, wastewater and
electricity).

12. Value added of Bank support:
The World Bank has been actively involved in environmental initiatives in Mauritius, and has developed a supportive
working relationship with the GOM. Bank assistance has supported the NEAP, the Environmental Monitoring and
Development Project and the Sewerage Master Plan Study. The Bank's strategy is to maintain its lead role in assisting
the GOM to achieve the goals set in the NEAP and Sewerage Master Plan, and to contribute to the financing of the
National Sewerage Program. While the Bank and other donors are assisting in providing the physical investments
defined in the NSP, the proposed Bank operation adds components to improve sector management and ensure financial
sustainability for the sector as a whole. In addition, the Bank has been instrumental in mobilizing Japanese OECF
funding for environmental protection initiatives in Mauritius.

section)
Fiscal impact (for all projects): The GOM will contribute US$ 17.6 million over 6 years to project financing, representing
26.3 % of total project financing. This contribution will come from the Government's Capital Budget. Cost-recovery
measures included in the project (tariffs, fees, pollution penalties) are designed to cover O&M and depreciation
expenditures in the Current Account Budget, and a gradually increasing share of the debt service in the Capital Budget.
This analysis is detailed in Annex 5.
i4. Financial Assessmen t (see Annex 5) NPV at estiated Discoun t Rate of 1%a  .Mu Rs  29) milion; IFRR= 8.1 i   
The proposed sewerage scheme and technology for the Port Louis South and Lower Beau Bassin/Coromandel areas,
known as the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage System, was selected as the least-cost and most environmentally sound
solution to wastewater pollution problems affecting these areas. This solution was selected after feasibility studies
involving technical and economic comparison of various alternatives.
The Internal Financial Rate of Return (IFRR), which in constant prices relates the sewerage revenues to the capital and
operating costs of the Montagne Jacquot sewerage facilities, was computed as an indication of the minimum economic
return. The life of the project has been estimated at 30 years. Revenues attributable to the project were used as a first
estimate of the consumer's willingness to pay in quantifying the estimated internal rate of return for the proposed project.
The cost stream includes: (i) base costs and physical contingencies for civil works, equipment, engineering studies,
supervision and operation and maintenance for the transport, treatment and disposal of wastewater for Port Louis South
and Lower Beau Bassin/Coromandel; and (ii) the investment costs for additional household and industrial connections
(to be financed by GOM and implemented by WWA). The IFRR is approximately 8.1%. The IFRR is considered to be
acceptable given: (i) the nearly total lack of cost-recovery mechanisms at present; and (ii) the social nature of the propose
project with its intangible anticipated health, economic and environmental benefits.
The computation of the IFRR is shown in Annex 5.

15. Technical Assessment:
The project concerns the transport, treatment and disposal of wastewater from the areas of
Port Louis South and Lower Beau Bassin/Coromandel. The tributary areas include residential, commercial and industrial
wastewater sources, with industry concentrated on the industrial estates of Plaine Lauzun, Coromandel, and La Tour
Koenig. The existing sewerage service consists of preliminary treatment works at Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables,
and shallow ocean outfalls to dispose of the wastewater. The existing wastewater works provide inadequate treatment and
create severe pollution problems in the vicinity of the ocean outfalls and should therefore be replaced.
A new wastewater treatment plant will be constructed at Montagne Jacquot; the site has been chosen for ease of
expansion to provide additional capacity. in future years and to provide higher levels of treatment, if required. Two new
wastewater pumping stations and a new transmission main will be constructed to transport the wastewater from Fort
Victoria and Pointe aux Sables to the Montagne Jacquot site.

15. Technical Assessment continued:
Different wastewater treatment alternatives were developed based on receiving-water quality standards for ocean waters
and for wastewater reuse in irrigation; two main options were retained. It was concluded that the ocean water quality
standards could be met with treatment works providing preliminary and primary treatment, disinfection, sludge
stabilization, and sludge dewatering processes, with the effluent discharged through an ocean outfall 645 meters long at ad
(Alternative 1). For Alternative 2, reuse of treated wastewater in irrigation, it was concluded that
water quality standards could be met by treatment works providing preliminary, primary and secondary treatment,
disinfection, sludge stabilization, and sludge dewatering processes, with effluent not used for irrigation to be discharged
into the ocean at a depth of 20 meters.
The decision on which alternative to implement was based on the preliminary results of a study to determnine the
economic and technical feasibility of reusing treated wastewater from the Montagne Jacquot treatment plant in agricultura
irrigation. As the feasibility of irrigation reuse cannot be established for the immediate future, the study recommended
implementation of the Alternative 1. This alternative provides flexibility in that the primary treatment works can be
expanded and the level of treatment increased at any time in the future.
For the effluent discharge, an ocean outfall at a depth of 100 meters deep was deemed impractical. An ocean outfall at a
depth of 30 meters will provide satisfactory dispersal of effluent receiving primary treatment and disinfection. This meets
water quality standards for recreational waters at the adjacent shore and at the Pointe aux Sables reef and lagoon.
Wastewater Flows: The average dry-weather wastewater flow from the service area is projected to grow from
24,800 cubic meters per day (m3/d) in 1997 to 60,500 m3/d in 2017. Essentially all of the growth in flow will be due
to increases in population served. In the Pointe aux Sables service area, the average daily domestic flow will more than
triple over the same period, from 6,500 m3/d in 1997 to over 19,900 m3/d in 2017. Domestic flow from Fort Victoria is
projected to increase from 10,000 m3/d to 25,000 m3/d during this period.
The proposed investment, designed to respond to immediate needs, also provides the capacity to treat the wastewater
flows projected for the year 2005, an average daily flow of 48,000 m3/d. An additional incremental investment by WWA
of about US$3.5 million, envisaged for 2010, would provide the capacity to treat projected wastewater flow for the year
2017, estimated at 60,000 m3/d.
................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
16. Institutional Assessment:
The Government of Mauritius has defined the sewerage program (NSP), presently under implementation with the
assistance of the donor community, as a national priority. The GOM is in the process of taking the necessary measures to
facilitate program efficiency and enable implementation of the most appropriate policy reforms to respond to the present
and future needs of the sector.
The scope of the NSP, and consequently donor concerns about national capacity to implement this program, call for the
definition of the future role of WWA coherent with the sector policy and the overall objectives of the NSP. This will
involve: (i) review and modernization of the sector's legal and institutional frameworks; (ii) adoption and progressive
implementation of appropriate cost-recovery mechanisms to allow financial sustainability; (iii) subsequent restructuring,
strengthening and training of WWA to adequately play its future role as "maitre d'ouvrage delegue"; and (iv) adoption of
the necessary measures to ensure proper program implementation. All of these aspects are included in a Sector Policy
Letter that the GOM has prepared. In addition, the GOM will draft and promulgate a new WWA Act to provide a legal
basis for WWA's new structure and function and to define its role, responsibilities and interactions with other concerned
institutions, governmental or private.
a. Executing agencies: The WWA will retain overall responsibility for project execution. During project preparation,
WWA has been assisted by international consultants and by technical expertise provided under the project and by the
European Union.

16. Institutional Assessment continued:
b. Project management: WWA will carry out day-to-day project management activities. Given the limited capacity and
experience of WWA, it will be assisted, over the life of the project, by external consultants with international experience
and practical operational backgrounds in the overall management of sewerage systems. The institutional strengthening
component will provide needed training to supplement the external technical assistance in developing WWA's capacity
to plan and manage contracts for capital projects and operation and maintenance.
Design and specifications for construction of the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage System have been developed during
project preparation by international consultants, selected according to World Bank guidelines, financed through a
Japanese PHRD Grant. The construction works are conventional in nature and therefore no major risks are expected
during implementation. Construction will be carried out by private contractors selected through international competitive
bidding. Sea outfall construction is expected to proceed with contractor prequalification. Given its limited experience,
and the scope of the works to be undertaken, WWA will be assisted in construction supervision by external consulting
engineers, to be selected internationally. The consulting duties will include verification of compliance with specifications
for works and equipment, and supervision of construction, installation, testing and commissioning of the various physical
components.
~~~~~~~~....   i~  ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
17. Social Assessment:
A social assessment, undertaken as part of the environmental impact assessment, looked at the impact of the proposed
project on stakeholders (residents, businesses and workers) in the project and neighboring areas. The project will
improve environmental living conditions and reduce health threats for populations in heavily urbanized and industrial
areas of Port Louis (southern districts and affected coastal area). Tariffs for cost-recovery will be set according to a cost-
recovery study that examined ability and willingness to pay for sewerage service (affordability). Costs for populations
will be somewhat offset by pretreatment of effluent by industries, which will reduce the overall cost of service.
For the country as a whole, there is a need to convince the population of the need to connect to the public sewer system
and to pay for sewerage services. The cost of connection is relatively high (Rs. 15,000, approximately US$750), a strong
disincentive to switch from on-site sewerage. In addition, sewerage tariffs historically have been set quite low, billing
has been haphazard, and collection has not been enforced. The WWA will launch a public awareness campaign to inform
the population of the improvements in service underway through the NSP; this will be linked to information on the new
tariffs so as to instill the idea of paying for better service. Sewerage tariffs determined as a percentage of water
consumption will increase the transparency of the service provided, and the new system ofjoint billing with water fees
should increase collection and reinforce the interrelated nature of the two sectors. The GOM is currently considering a
National Sewer Connection Program, to provide incentives (economic and otherwise) for households to connect to public
sewers.
18. Environmental Assessment (EA):     Environmental         [X] A      [II  B      Ill   C
Category
Two of the three main sources of water pollution in Mauritius are from waste water sources: contamination of domestic
water supplies by overflowing of sewerage during cyclones and floods, and disposal of industrial waste (e.g. dyes) into
natural water bodies (MLGE 1991). The purpose of the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage and Sanitation Project is to provide
a long-term solution for the treatment and disposal of wastewater in the Port Louis South and Lower Beau Bassin/
Coromandel area, to achieve pollution abatement to a level that allows the disposal of treated effluents in the natural
environment and to maintain sustainable development of economic activities of Mauritius. A full environmental
assessment was carried out as part of project preparation, as required by the World Bank and the GOM's National
Environment Policy. Mitigation measures from the EA will be incorporated into project design, and will form the basis
of standards for treated wastewater prior to disposal.

18. Environmental Assessment continued:
The environmental and socio-economic impacts of the Montagne Jacquot water and sanitation project are expected to be
overwhelmingly positive. The present discharge arrangements in the Port Louis area and south beyond Pointe aux Sables
are resulting in extremely poor environmental quality, unacceptable impacts on human health and well-being, and
degradation of the marine environment to such a serious extent that only a few species can survive in the areas affected
by wastewater discharges.
The implementation of the Montagne Jacquot project, and in particular the decommissioning of several outfalls and their
replacement with a single ocean outfall off Montagne Jacquot, is expected to have some immediate beneficial effects,
but because of the exceptionally serious degraded state of the local marine environment, natural rehabilitation of the
currently affected areas will take some time. It may even take several years before normal seaside activities such as
swimming, fishing, various activities in boats and beachcombing can be resumed in the Bain des Dames and at Pointe
aux Sables without fear of serious health implications. The processes of natural rehabilitation may be assisted
nevertheless, by community efforts at beach cleaning, and there is little doubt that development of strategic plans with the
relevant government agencies for enhancing economic opportunities, will assist in regenerating the worst affected
communities and help them to realize the economic potential of the area. Because of the proximity of the Bain des Dames
and Pointe aux Sables communities to the main commercial center of Mauritius, and the recognition they have already
received as potential recreational zones in the city, it is likely that development of tourism and services, may well assist
in the expansion of employment opportunities in the area.
Potential negative impacts associated with the project
Construction phase impacts. The principal negative impacts associated with the Montagne Jacquot project would be
experienced during the construction phase, and primarily caused by the trench digging operation to lay the main transfer
pipeline from Fort Victoria via Pointe aux Sables works to Montagne Jacquot. Whether the route chosen is along the
main road or through the lagoon off Pointe aux Sables, mitigation of the negative impacts is not a straightforward matter
and contractors will need to be closely supervised, to ensure implementation of the recommended mitigation measures,
as well as efficient and competent management of the construction activities. No resettlement is involved, but
construction of the pipeline will most likely cause serious disruptions in traffic for approximately 3 months. Every
attempt will be made to reduce this disruption, including carrying out construction activities at night or outside of rush
hours.
Impacts of the ocean outfall. Although the wastewater discharge at Montagne Jacquot is expected to fall well within the
required effluent standard, and to achieve the desired water quality standards in the receiving environment, the actual
environmental impacts of the discharge cannot be accurately predicted on the basis of the available information.
Experience from elsewhere suggests that the performance of individual outfalls and environmental impacts on living
communities, depends so much on the physical dispersion characteristics of the receiving environment, that
generalizations can be misleading. Nevertheless, because of the introduction of a disinfection stage into the effluent
treatment process, the potential health hazards for swimmers, divers etc. in the vicinity of the outfall will be negligible.
The potential impacts of treated effluent on benthic communities, and in particular corals, are exceptionally difficult to
predict accurately. Despite the system of diffusers and expected dispersion and dilution performance of the outfall, the
relatively slow bottom currents may militate against steady removal of effluent out of the main discharge area, leading to
progressive eutrophication of coastal waters off. Montagne Jacquot. Because of the extreme sensitivity of corals to
elevated nutrient concentrations, it is highly likely that some bleaching and death will be observed in communities near to
the discharge. Inevitably loss of corals leads to progressive deterioration of the reef ecosystem, since it is dependent on
coral productivity to drive the system, so that the greater resilience of associated species becomes more or less irrelevant.

18. Environmental Assessment continued:
While it is obviously preferable to avoid any deterioration in coastal marine communities and reef ecosystems in
particular because of the many important resource generation and protection functions they serve, there are very few
locations around the coast of Mauritius where it is possible to avoid coral reefs. The site adopted for the Montagne
Jacquot outfall is one of the few breaks in the reef on the west coast suitable for an outfall, where the consequences of
some deterioration in reef communities (not of exceptional quality or diversity) are acceptable, on grounds of making
possible the urgent and very necessary improvements in environmental quality further north.
Impacts of the Montagne Jacquot WastewaterTreatment Plant. Providing the new wastewater treatment plant at
Montagne Jacquot is efficiently and properly managed, the potentially significant impacts can be mitigated in the course
of normal remedial action on site and/or through supervision and monitoring of staff activity. A plant of this type
occasionally produces offensive odors, and if they prove to be unacceptable to the local residents, it is possible to
consider including an odor control system. The project plans include a buffer zone (detailed in the environmental
mitigation plan) between the plant and the neighboring community, which should mitigate most of the noise and smell
problems. Additionally, the sludge disposal operation will have to be managed cleanly and efficiently, or it may result in
complaints from the general public. The technology on site will be relatively straightforward to manage, and so ensuring
that the plant staff are conscientious and committed to running a well managed operation is probably the most important
element in ensuring future trouble-free operations.

20. Sustainability:
Environmental and health benefits will be sustained by the continuous functioning of the Montagne Jacquot system,
which depends on available resources for and provision of routine maintenance. Industrial compliance with
environmental regulations is also critical to sustain project benefits. These factors should be assured by the cost-recovery
mechanisms (tariffs, economic incentives for environmental compliance, etc.), and by improved sector management.

22. Possible Controversial Aspects:
There may be social resistance to paying increased tariffs, however increases will be phased to avoid undue hardship.
Likewise, there may be social resistance to connecting to public sewers due to the relatively high connection cost and
lack of acceptance of the need to connect. This will be addressed by the public awareness campaign and incentives built
into the National Connection Program.
Industry may be reluctant to comply with effluent pretreatment requirements. The project includes clear effluent and
pretreatment standards and an industrial compliance plan, which will be negotiated with industry. This compliance plan
will be supported by economic incentives and penalties to ensure compliance.
Reuse of treated wastewater for agricultural irrigation does not have widespread acceptance. If proven feasible by the
wastewater reuse study, this component may be added later, when more socially acceptable.

Detailed Project Description
Project Component A - US$57.2 million (total cost of component)
Montagne Jacquot Sewerage System. This component, an integral element of the Government's Sewerage
Master Plan, comprises the physical construction of the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage System, including
acquisition of the treatment plant site, industrial pretreatment of wastewater, construction of pipelines and
sewers, two pumping stations, the treatment plant and the sea outfall, and supervision works. On the basis of a
pre-feasibility study, three technological options were considered. The final design of the sewerage works was
defined on the basis of preparation studies on technical feasibility, cost of technologies, environmental impact
and cost-recovery feasibility. The chosen option consists of the following subcomponents:
(i) Land acquisition and compensation: The WWA will first acquire the site for construction of the
Montagne Jacquot Treatment Plant, including a buffer zone between the plant and the neighboring community.
WWA will also acquire all rights of way necessary for construction of the treatment plant and transmission
mains. The pumping stations will be built on sites currently occupied by outdated pumping stations, so no land
acquisition is required for them. There will be no resettlement due to the project, however construction of
transmission mains may interrupt operation of businesses, in which case, compensation may be paid. This
subcomponent is financed entirely by the Government of Mauritius.
(ii) Pipelines and sewers: Pipelines will be constructed to accommodate the forecast increasing flows
and will carry wastewater from the Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables pumping stations directly to the
Montagne Jacquot treatment plant. The network will consist of transmission and rising mains connecting the
pumping stations with the Montagne Jacquot plant; additional connections would be added as needed to connect
the industrial estates and residences to the transmission mains. At the present time, all transmission and rising
mains will be land based, but with the option for "cross-bay" connection from Fort Victoria to Pointe aux Sables
if a contractor submits a technically feasible proposal, as the Environmental Impact Assessment deemed this
option environmentally sound. This subcomponent will be funded by the World Bank.
(iii) Pumping stations: Two new pumping stations are to be constructed on the sites of the Fort Victoria
and Pointe aux Sables pumping stations, which are currently inadequate to handle even current wastewater
flows in an environmentally sound manner. The new works are needed to handle the forecast increasing
wastewater flows; the existing works will be left in place to handle emergencies. The pumping stations are
centrally located and can therefore facilitate effluent transmission with the use of minimum of force mains and
optimized usage of gravity sewers. In particular, Pointe aux Sables is located to handle transfer of wastewater
from the new developments and industrial estates, and can utilize existing gravity sewers. The construction
contract will include three years of operation and maintenance, after which time O&M will be opened for
contracting by the general private sector. The Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (OECF) will finance this
subcormiponent.
(iv) Treatment Plant. The Montagne Jacquot Treatment Plant will utilize primary treatment plus
disinfection. Initially, the plant will be constructed with the capacity to handle a 48,000 m3 flow. In a later
phase, the plant may be expanded to handle 60,000 m3. Sludge will be stabilized and dewatered and
transported by truck for disposal in a sanitary landfill. As with the pumping stations, the construction contract



Page 21
will include three years of operation and maintenance, after which time these activities will be opened for
contracting to the private sector at large. This subcomponent will be financed by OECF and GOM.
(v) Sea outfall. Based on the findings of the environmental impact analysis, industrial and urban
wastewater that has undergone preliminary and primary treatment with disinfection may safely be disposed of in
an open sea outfall of 30 meters deep. The effluent from the plant will be discharged by gravity to the open sea
off the coast of Montagne Jacquot through a pipe line leading to a series of six diffusers at an average depth of
30 meters. The outfall will be approximately 645 meters out from the shore line. The diffusers will spaced at
10 meters to prevent intermixing before the plumes reach the surface. OECF and GOM will provide financing
for this subcomponent.
(vi) Industrial Pretreatment. Under the project, industries in unserved areas will contribute to building
pretreatment works that will be connected to the Montagne Jacquot system. As part of the project, an agreement
is to be negotiated and signed between the WWA and industries specifying industrial effluent standards,
pretreatment measures and monitoring arrangements (see component C). This agreement will be supported by
economic incentives, such as polluter pays and an industrial facilitation fund to encourage compliance. This
subcomponent is to be financed by industry.
(vii) Supervision of works. All construction works (pipelines, pumping stations, treatment plant and sea
outfall) will be supervised by independent contractors. OECF and GOM will fund one contract for supervision
of OECF-financed subcomponents, and the Bank will finance a contract for supervision of pipeline and sewer
construction.
Project Component B - US$4.6 million (total cost of component)
Sector Equipment and Expertise. This component, cofinanced by the World Bank and the GOM, addresses
the need for reforms in the water and wastewater sectors in the interest of achieving improvements in and
integration of policy and management of both sectors. In particular, the project will clarify the linkages (legal,
fiscal and organizational) between WWA, the Central Water Authority (CWA), the Water Resource Unit of the
Ministry of Public Utilities, the Ministry of Environment and Quality of Life and the Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Cooperatives. This will be achieved by engaging technical assistance to carry out the studies
listed below, strengthen intersectoral coordination and assist with preparing recommendations for Mid-term
Review discussion of the general framework for integrated sector policy and development and draft policies and
an action plan to implement recommendations, as well, preparation of the awareness campaign to support
initiatives in the water and wastewater sectors, and establishment of the National Sewer Connection Program to
be implemented over 10 years.
(i) The studies in this component consist of: (a) mapping of the sewer networks; (b) a Household
Connection inventory and feasibility study; (c) GIS and digital software; (d) institutional studies for the
Midterm review (progress on and need for new restructuring of sector institutions); (e) implementation of the
public awareness campaign; (f) project implementation audit; and other studies as needed.
(ii) Expertise will be provided to carry out the above studies and to upgrade and train in software
necessary to carry out joint billing for water and wastewater services.
(iii) The above expertise will be complemented by provision of water meters to support the joint billing.
WWA will procure this equipment according to CWA specifications. This will be financed by the GOM.

Project Component C - US$3.8 million (total cost of component)
WWA Institution-building. This component, cofinanced by the World Bank and the GOM, addresses the
financial and institutional constraints in the provision of wastewater services, as identified in the Sewerage
Master Plan. The project will assist the Waste Water Authority (established in March 1996) in its development
from a division within the Ministry of Public Utilities to an autonomous agency with overall responsibility for
constructing, operating, maintaining and financing wastewater infrastructure. Subcomponents include:
(i) WWA program management assistance to strengthen WWA to assume its new role as "mailtre
d'ouvrage delegu6." This will include technical assistance on cost accounting and on preparation of terms of
reference for studies and contracts, the contracting procedure and management of project contracts with the
private sector. The technical assistance will also support the WWA in outsourcing of O&M on the existing
wastewater infrastructure and eventual contracting out of O&M and construction on future works. This will
enable the WWA to focus on planning, programming and managing contracts for future works.
(ii) WWA staff training program. This program will focus on the training of the WWA staff in their new
role to: (i) manage the ongoing National Sewerage Program, including contracting out of works and services,
supervision of construction, future supervision of operation and maintenance of wastewater treatment systems;
(ii) plan and program future required investments/extensions in the sector; (iii) monitor, with MLGE,
environmental quality and standards and implement mitigating measures; and (iv) manage projects and facilitate
private sector involvement in the wastewater services. The program includes training both in-country and
abroad.
(iii) Support for implementation of the industrial waste management program. As noted in Component
A, industry is to contribute to the project by pretreating its effluent. This subcomponent focuses on developing
a framework for negotiation between WWA and industry, negotiating an agreement on pretreatment standards,
methods, monitoring arrangements and incentives and strengthening WWA to monitor and ensure compliance
with standards and regulations. During negotiations, agreement was reached with the GOM on pretreatment
standards, to be set by WWA in consultation with the Ministry of Local Government and Environment
(MLGE), and a timetable to install and operate pretreatment facilities, to be determined and agreed upon by the
WWA and industry. Industry would then install pretreatment facilities, either at-source or collective, for which
incentives may be provided by the GOM (tax incentives, facilitation fund, penalties). During implementation,
industries, the MLGE and WWA will monitor the quality of pretreated industrial effluent against these
standards and WWA will review the results semi-annually. Any industry not meeting the standards, according
to the agreed-upon timetable, would be subject to "polluter-pays" penalties.
Implementation arrangements:
Implementation arrangements are detailed in the Project Implementation Plan (PIP). WWA is currently
preparing engineering and design work for the Montagne Jacquot system with assistance from internationally-
selected consultants financed under a Japanese PHRD Grant and a Project Preparation Facility advance. WWA
will manage construction of the Montagne Jacquot system through contracts with consultants, selected
according to International Competitive Bidding. Cost recovery will be implemented by the WWA in concert
with CWA: sewerage tariffs will be determined according to amount of metered water. Revenues will be
collected by the CWA and the sewerage surcharge transferred to the WWA. Industrial compliance with
pretreatment standards (set by the MLGE) will be monitored by industry, the MLGE and reported to WWA;
WWA will conduct its own monitoring to check industrial contribution to pretreatment, and imposing penalties
for noncompliance. WWA will also be responsible for implementing the environmental mitigation plan (see



-. f 8                Page 23
Project Implementation Plan, Annex 5). WWA will be responsible for the institutional strengthening
component, and for ensuring that appropriate technical expertise is engaged, equipment procured and staff
training carried out according to the Project Implementation Plan. WWA will develop and propose amendments
to existing sectoral legislation, and work with the MLGE and the MEDRC to draft and enact necessary
intersectoral legislation. The Steering Committee will ensure coordination between program agencies and
among all donor-funded projects within the NSP.
Procurement: Works wholly or partly funded by IBRD will be procured in accordance with the Bank's
Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (published January 1995; revised January and
August 1996). Consultancy services wholly or partly financed by IBRD will be procured in accordance with the
Bank's Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers (January 1997).
The Borrower's procurement regulations and procedures have been reviewed and found acceptable. Before
negotiations, a General Procurement Notice was prepared by WWA and transmitted to IBRD for publication in
the United Nations Development Business (UNDB) to advertise all assignments expected to be financed by
IBRD under the project. WWA will use Standard Bidding Documents published by the Bank for preparation of
bidding and prequalification documents for works to be procured under International Competitive Bidding
(ICB), and for Requests for Proposals and consulting service contracts. Detailed project procurement
arrangements are given in Annex 6.
Accounting, financial reporting and auditing arrangements: Under the project, WWA will implement (before
June 30,1999) a cost accounting system tracing the cost of the various services, including depreciation, the cost
of capital and other common costs, and associated revenues, to provide a full basis for cost recovery and tariff
policy. WWA will keep separate project accounts together with their statutory financial statements. Terms of
reference for the annual audits of the project accounts were agreed upon at negotiations. Auditing will be
carried out by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and the reports of such audits will be submitted to
the Bank no later than six month after the end of the Borrower's fiscal year.
Monitoring and evaluation arrangements: Supervision. The Bank will devote some 80 staff weeks for
supervision of loan progress through FY2003. During the first three years, supervision will focus on progress
towards achieving specific objectives such as works, implementation of WWA institutional action plan, tariffs
and cost-recovery targets, implementation of the industrial waste management program and the performance of
involved agencies. Particular attention would be given during supervision and project reviews to
implementation of the national sewerage connections program, including execution of the reticulation system,
number of WWA employees, implementation of the WWA training program and the operation and financial
performance of the WWA. In addition, effluent quality monitoring will be carefully monitored (particularly
industrial effluent) to ensure compliance with quality standards.
Monitoring: Overall project monitoring will be based on indicators confirmed during appraisal and the Project
Implementation Plan which were finalized by the Borrower and agreed on during negotiations. Monitoring will
be carried out by the Steering Committee, chaired by MEDRC, and assisted by consultants as necessary.
Progress under each project component and the Institutional Action Plan will be monitored and coordinated by
WWA under the guidance of the Steering Committee. Progress reports will be prepared by WWA every six
months, commencing in November 1998, and submitted to the Bank within one month thereafter. No later than
three months after completion of the project, GOM will prepare and furnish to the Bank a report on the
execution of the project, its costs and the benefits derived and to be derived from it.
Mid-term review: A Mid-term Review will be carried out in June 1999 by the Bank, together with GOM and
OECF. In addition to covering all areas included in annual reviews, the Mid-term Review will assess the



Page 24
implementation status of the National Sewerage Program, the various sectoral studies, degree of implementation
of policy reforms, institutional arrangements, tariffs and the cost-recovery system, the regulatory framework,
private sector participation and evolution of the role of WWA in the sector. Prior to the Mid-term Review,
WWA will contract a consulting firm (under project finance) to review and assess the progress of NSP and
WWA restructuring, conduct studies on public utilities and on the water and sanitation sectors and prepare the
necessary documentation for the Review. In particular, the Review will consider and discuss the results of the
following studies and reports: (i) review of past performance and implementation of the NSP in general, and
the Montagne Jacquot project in particular; (ii) review the recommendations and proposals of the study on the
water and wastewater sector studies, including a 5-10 year action plan to implement recommendations; and (iii)
review of the project implementation plan (PIP) and recommendations for updating/amending the PIP for the
remainder of project implementation. It is expected that the Mid-term Review will result in determination of a
general framework for future integrated policy and development of the public utilities sectors (water,
wastewater and electricity), which will in turn guide reforms of policies and institutions in these and related
sectors. The Mid-term Review will also evaluate the technical and financial viability of the proposed utilities
investment corporation based on sector studies.

ANNEX 4
National Sewerage Program
Mauritius Environmental Sewerage and Sanitation Project
Economic Analysis of the capital investment of the project
(Montagne Jacquot Sewerage System)
Program Objectives
The National Sewerage Program is designed to remove a public health threat that could severely
affect the national economy. The program also aims at reducing the present level of coastal
pollution resulting from discharge of raw sewage into coastal waters near populated residential
areas. The Montagne Jacquot Sewerage System Project, an integral component of the Program,
addresses these issues at the national level and, in particular, for the area of Port Louis South.
Potential Environmental Health Threats
The safety of the public water supply in Port Louis is monitored by the Environmental Health
Unit in the Ministry of Health (MOH). Samples are taken regularly from various points of the
distribution system and undergo bacteriological tests. While the drinking water supply is
generally safe, results from sample testing in the years 1994 and 1996 show some intrusion of
contaminants from sewage. The likely explanation for this contamination is intrusion of
contaminated groundwater into the distribution system during periods when the system is empty
or under lower pressure than the surrounding groundwater.
If demand for sewerage infrastructure continues to vastly outpace supply, and if the current
infrastructure ages without replacement, there is a potential that such contamination could lead to
the spread of infectious diseases, such as cholera or typhoid, could spread to the entire population
directly through the water distribution system or indirectly through infected persons that handle
contaminated food.
Without the project the current unsatisfactory state of environmental threat could be expected to
deteriorate further.  Economic and population growth would fuirther strain the present
rudimentary sewerage system and on-site sanitation systems, increasing groundwater
contamination in the Port Louis area. As noted above, contamination of potable water in the Port
Louis distribution system could trigger a water-related epidemic, such as cholera or typhoid
fever. Such an epidemic would have a disastrous impact on the country's important tourism
industry. In addition, eutrophication of the coastal waters off Fort Victoria and Point aux Sables
would increase further and remain a danger to the public at large, to fishing, and to the marine
environment.
With the project these threats would be removed. The project could be expected to produce a
number of benefits:



Annex 4                                                                        Page 30
(a)    direct benefits to residential water supply consumers, in the form  of increased
consumption, since the sewerage network would replace the septic tanks which serve at least one
third of the population. As a result, septic tank users would save the cost of periodic tank
emptying. Similarly, industrial consumers could increase their water consumption due to the
increase in sewerage capacity;
(b)    direct benefits to present and future consumers in the Fort Victoria and Pointe aux Sables
areas could be expected to produce higher real estate values reflecting discontinuation of raw
sewage discharge into nearby coastal waters. Real estate value increases are a proxy for the
discounted net environmental benefits over future years;
(c)    benefits from avoiding potential loss of tourism revenue, other production losses and
higher curative health care costs that would occur should the present unsatisfactory
environmental situation trigger a water-related epidemic. The project is akin to buying insurance
against catastrophic scenarios, the cost of which would surpass the premium of the insurance
policy;
(d)   intangible benefits in the form of the preservation of the aquatic environment, now under
stress from raw sewage discharge off Fort Victoria and Pointes aux Sables.
The Principles of Economic Evaluation
The economic evaluation of the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage System comprises two phases: first,
a least-cost analysis and second, a cost-benefit analysis.
The least-cost analysis tests whether the expected project objectives could be met by alternative
project designs at a lower economic cost than the proposed design. The analysis is contained in
the engineering studies and confirms that the project, as designed, is indeed the least-cost,
environmentally sound solution. It employs simple and well-tested technology to collect sewage,
pump it to a primary treatment plant to be constructed at Montagne Jacquot and discharge the
treated sewage into the sea via a submarine outfall at a point well outside the ecologically
sensitive coral reefs. At the discharge point, ocean currents and dissolution will be sufficient to
render the discharges ecologically safe.
An important complementary control for the potential threat of a water-related epidemic is to
ensure that the water supply system operates at full pressure at all times. This would involve
Central Water Authority redesign and improvement of operations in the Port Louis area. At
present, the most serious contamination occurs when cyclones pass over Mauritius and are
followed by torrential rains. At these times, turbidity in the river from which Port Louis receives
its raw water rises to such high levels that the treatment plant cannot purify the water. The plant
is routinely shut down and the distribution system eventually empties from negative pressure,
causing seepage from septic cesspools that could contaminate both the water distribution system
and groundwater reserves.
The economic cost-benefit analysis is more involved. It compares the economic costs and
benefits of the Montagne Jacquot project component over the construction period and over its
assumed 30-year period of operation. Detailed calculations are shown in Annex 4-Table 01 and
Table 02. All costs and benefits are expressed in constant mid-1997 prices. All investment and
operating costs are net of import duties and of either taxes or subsidies. Prices for unskilled labor



Annex 4                                                                     Page 31
and for foreign exchange have not been shadow-priced. Mauritius enjoys full employment and
labor rates are assumed to reflect relative labor scarcity. Similarly, foreign exchange can be
freely traded in the open economy and the exchange rate is assumed to reflect the scarcity of
foreign exchange.
Assumptions for the Economic Cost-Benefit Calculation!
Incremental project costs are those of the Montagne Jacquot project component. Additional costs
are charged to reflect additional sewage collection costs necessary to connect consumers that now
rely on septic tanks. The off-setting cost savings from not having periodic emptying of septic
tanks have not been quantified, implying a slight overestimation of operation and maintenance
costs. It has been assumed that there are no sunken investment costs.
Three kinds of project benefits have been quantified:
First, incremental consumer payments for newly charged sewage collection and treatment are
assumed to measure mainly the consumers' willingness to have their sewage removed.
Second, the rise in land values has been estimated for the Pointe aux Sables area. The entire area
adjacent to the beaches is about 400 hectares. At present, the value is considerably lower than
comparable areas elsewhere in the Port Louis area, in part due to raw sewage pollution of the
coastal area. An informal survey of property prices revealed that the prices for undeveloped land
could be expected to double or even treble if coastal pollution is discontinued. In order to avoid
double-counting benefits and to be conservative, the assumption has been made that prices
would rise substantially less, or on the order of 50 percent on average. For the same reasons, the
area of influence has been reduced by 10 percent to avoid the risk of double-counting between
consumer payments and rises in property values.
Third, benefits in the form of avoided potential loss of tourism revenue, attributable to the
project, have been estimated in the following fashion:
(a)    A trend-line for total tourism revenue has been projected by applying a least-squares
analysis to the 1986-1995 period. Annual tourism revenue for each of these years was deflated
using Mauritius' consumer price index.
(b)    Total tourism revenue was then projected for each of the years 2002-2032, while keeping
constant annual tourism revenue from 2007 onwards. This level of revenue corresponds to the
with project scenario.
(c)    The assumption was then made that a cholera epidemic would strike Mauritius in the year
2002/2003, corresponding to the first year of operation of the Montagne Jacquot sewerage
system. Such an epidemic would be expected to substantially lower tourism flows to Mauritius.
The estimate is that the reduction in annual tourism would be 10 percent below the with project
scenario. As a point of comparison, in the case of a similar cholera epidemic in Perui in 1991, the
decline in gross tourism earnings due to the cholera epidemic ranged from 28 percent to 6
percent.
(d)    Epidemics are a matter of probability. At present, Mauritius is free of cholera. However,
there is a probability, assumed to be 10 percent, that an outbreak could result from the arrival of



Annex 4                                                                                    Page 32
an infected visitor coinciding with unfavorable conditions in the water supply distribution system.
Avoided tourism revenue losses are then multiplied by this probability.
(e)    Not all losses in gross tourism  revenue are net losses.  The estimated, probability-
weighted tourism revenue losses are then multiplied by 80 percent, implying that variable costs
are on the order of 20 percent in the Mauritius tourism industry.
The Internal Rate-of-Return of the Montagne Jacquot Sewerage System Project component
The internal rate-of-return is calculated for the Montagne Jacquot project component as 23%.
This rate is considered satisfactory since it is well above the 10 percent estimated opportunity
cost of capital in Mauritius. The average weight of each of the three main benefits expected is
presented in Table 4-01:
Table 4-01
|Benefit contribution to     Cons. Payments     Land value    Prob.loccurencel   Total Benefits

In addition, the project has intangible social and environmental benefits that have not been
quantified.
Sensitivity Analysis

rate-of-return.

Table 4-03 tests the influence of the probability of occurrence of an epidemic.

The internal rate-of-return for the project is fairly robust. In all cases tested, the projected rate-
of-return can be reduced, but is still above the opportunity cost of capital.

Poverty Alleviation Impact
'The project is expected to alleviate poverty since it would improve sanitary conditions in Port
Louis and, over time, raise connection rates both of which would favor the lower-income
population in Port Louis proportionately more. Permanent improvement in environmental health
could also be expected to favor the poorer population more since they would most likely be the
first to be affected by a water-related epidemic.

ANNEX 5
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
THE WASTE WATER AUTHORITY
A. Past and present financial performances
Accounting and Auditing: As per WWA Act of 1991, the Waste Water Authority
(formerly the Waste Water Division) is responsible for:
* implementation of the Investment Program of the sanitation sector;
* operation of all sanitation infrastructure (e.g. sewer networks, wastewater treatment
plants); and
* management of the sanitation budget.
The WWA, currently equivalent to a Government department, follows the Government of
Mauritius Financial Management Manual (August 1990) in its financial and accounting
procedures, resource management, and control and audit procedures. The procedure for
the approval and award of its contracts is governed by the 1994 Central Tender Bill with
all tenders of Rs 500,000 and above being handled directly by the Central Tender Board.
The Financial Management Manual applicable to the Ministries/Departments does not
prescribe procedures for recording and accounting for fixed assets.
Wastewater Tariffs
Tariffs prior to July 1996: Previously, the sewerage tax was based on a percentage of the
net annual rentable value (NARV) of the property for those connected to a sewerage
network. For the different types of property, the percentage was:
1Domestic          1.0 %
- Commercial          1.5 %
- Industrial          2.0 %
New Tariffs: As of July 1, 1996, in conformity with the WWA Act of 1991, new tariffs
have been determined as follows:
*  Domestic: For domestic connections, the monthly charge will be Rs 25.00 per
household per month. The billing will be effected on a quarterly basis.
*  Commercial: For commercial connections, the rate will be 2.0 percent of the NARV,
with billing effected on a yearly basis.
*  Industrial: For industrial connections, the charge will be based on the water
consumed, i.e. Rs 2.00 per m3 of water consumed. The billing will be effected on a
monthly basis and according to Central Water Authority (CWA) procedures.
These new tariffs represent a provisional means for better cost recovery.



Annex 5                                                                    Page 37
Past and present financial performance
Expenditures
The expenditures of the Waste Water Authority are financed by the National Budget and
are shown in Table 5-1 for a number of fiscal years.
Table 5-1: Expenditures of the WWA for the period 1992-97 (In Mau Rs Million)
FE    d t         92-93      93 94    94       95-96    96-97
Recurrent       30.3       36.5      38.2      38.1    44.6
|Capital          33.7       28.3     15.0       39.7*    38.2
Total            64.0       64.8     52 6       77.8    82.8
* Actual expenditure  39.7. The budget figure voted was 173 Mau Rs. million.
The total expenditure for 1995-96 shows a marked increase over that of previous years,
which corresponds to the start of Investment Program implementation.
WWA Recurrent Costs: At the present level of recurrent costs and service connections, the
cost of operation and maintenance (excluding depreciation and debt service) by the WWA
for the current fiscal year, 1996-97, is Rs 4.10 per m3 of water flow. When translated to a
fixed charge, the equivalent payment required from households to cover this cost will be
Rs 82 per month. According to the proposed tariff, domestic consumers are expected to
pay Rs 25 per month only, or less than 30 percent of the recurrent cost. They are thus
heavily subsidized. The same is true for commercial and industrial consumers. Whereas
the extent of subsidy to commercial consumers could not be estimated in the absence of the
likely payment based on the NARV, the subsidy in case of industrial consumers is
estimated to be over 50 percent.
Expenditure on Existing Wastewater Facilities and Funding: The consolidated capital
expenditure on sewerage works over the year is not available. From the information
gathered from the Master Plan report and the budgets of the Waste Water Division, total
expenditure on capital works over the last 25 years, between 1970-95, is estimated at Rs
208 million. Full information on funding of the capital works is also not available.
However, it can be assumed that a substantial portion of the expenditure was met from
national budgetary resources.
Revenue: The revenue for the Waste Water Authority is derived principally from:
* the sewerage tax; and
* miscellaneous fees.
The sewerage tax has been defined above. Miscellaneous revenues include:
* house connection survey fees;
* cesspool and septic tank emptying fees; and
* house connections constructed by the Waste Water Authority.



Annex 5                                                                     Page 38
At present, the average cost for a household connection to a new sewer network is about
Rs 7,000 (from the household to the boundary of the property); to connect a household to
an existing sewer costs between Rs 10,000 to 15,000 (from the household to the sewer
network). For many households the relatively high cost of such works actually slows the
rate of house connection and hence affects improvement in wastewater collection.
Incentives will have to be identified to overcome this obstacle, such concessionary interest
on loans, GOM sharing part of the work costs, etc.
The revenue collected during past financial years is shown in Table 5-2 below.
Table 5-2: Revenue collected by the WWA (in Mau Rs million)
Revenue Source     92-93    93-94       94-95    95-96     96-97
Sewerage Tax        7.3      6.6        6.4      6.9        9.5
Miscellaneous       3.3      5.3        2.3      3.0        2.7
Total              10.6      11.9       8.7      9.9        12.2
As evident in the above table, the sewerage tax is the WWA's main source of revenue.
Conclusion: At present level of recurrent cost and number of service connections, the cost
of Operation and Maintenance (O & M) (excluding depreciation and debt service) by the
WWA for the current fiscal year, has been estimated to Mau Rs 3.2 per cum of estimated
wastewater flow. When translated to a monthly wastewater charge, the equivalent payment
required from the domestic households will be Mau Rs 64 at an average wastewater flow of
20 cum per month. According to the new tariff in place, the domestic consumers are
expected to pay Mau Rs 25 per month only, or the equivalent of about 40% of the actual 0
& M.
These new tariffs, at this level imply a heavy level of subsidy. The same is also true for the
commercial and industrial consumers. There is clearly a need to develop a sound and
financially sustainable cost recovery policy which would take into account the constraints
of affordability, equitability and willingness to pay. The proposed new cost recovery
system is described in the following sections of this annex.

B. The National Sewerage Program
Program cost estimates: The National Sewerage Program, defined by the Sewerage Master
Plan, has identified and prioritized 13 medium and large-scale projects (including works
underway) to be implemented over next six years. The aggregate cost of these priority projects
will be Mau. Rs. 5.511 billion by 2002-03. Details of the per project cost estimates and yearly
phasing are provided in Annex 5-01. The broad break-down under generic categories is provided
in Table 5-3:

C. Cost Recovery Options and Targets
Cost recovery principles: Financial management and pollution control in the wastewater sector
is a totally new area in Mauritius, and is one in which public involvement will be of major
importance. The extent of cost recovery expected from consumers of wastewater services under
the overall short and medium-term sector objectives must be considered carefully. The following
cost-recovery options have been considered:
1. Operation and maintenance cost ( 0 & M)
2. 0 & M cost plus depreciation;
3. 0 & M cost plus the higher of depreciation or debt service ( for external loan onlending only);
4. 0 & M cost plus the higher of depreciation or debt service ( for onlending of total Program
costs);
Cost Recovery Targets: To derive a medium-term tariff, beginning fiscal year 1998-99 to fiscal
year 2006-07, cost recovery targets have been calculated to arrive at the level of recovery
required for the four options stated above. Details are given in Annex 5-03. Table 5-5
summarizes the results, at constant mid- 1997 prices, of the cost recovery analysis for the various
options and estimates the required average wastewater tariffs applicable to the water bill.

The  relation  of these  costs  and  required  average  tariff levels  to  household  income  and
affordability levels for water tariffs are discussed below.
D. Domestic Affordability Analysis
Affordability is the economic and financial ability of the consumer to demand certain goods and
services given his other needs. Affordability also influences a consumer's willingness to pay. It
is difficult to fix the affordability level for water supply and sewerage, given that water is usually
considered a basic human need, and sewerage service levels are derived from water consumption.



Annex 5                                                                               Page 41
However, it has been accepted, although more as a rule of thumb, that expenditure on urban
water supply and sewerage should not exceed more than 4 to 6 percent of household income. In
Mauritius, Household Budget Survey (July 1994) reported the average monthly household income
for 1991-92 as Rs 6,500, with 62 percent of the population earning below the monthly average,
and 7 percent earning less than Rs 2,000. The survey reports average expenditure on water as 1.4
percent (Rs 67.8) of monthly income. Considering a real term increase of 2.5 percent in the
income level over the past several years the average monthly household income for 1996-97 has
been assumed to be Rs 7,540.
Table 5-6 examines the relationship between the proposed water charges, analyzed by the CWA
relative to income, and the amount available to meet the wastewater charges for the forecast
period.
The analysis in this table shows that water charges in relation to household income rise over the
period, with the maximum amount available for wastewater charges remaining stable at around
Mau Rs 150/per month from 1998 through 2003, and then rising to allow better recovery of
wastewater costs. It further suggests that wastewater charges should be maintained at around 2-3
percent of average household income.

Whereas the analysis in Table 5-7 below shows that the wastewater charges as a percent of water
charges need to be fixed at between about 25 percent in 1998/99 to about 175 percent in 2004/05
under the four cost recovery options considered, the affordability analysis shows that the
wastewater charges should represent a maximum of 100 percent of the water charges. Table 5-7
further indicates that the monthly wastewater charges in relation to monthly household income,
under the four recovery options considered, varies between 0.5 percent to 1 percent, to recover
the O&M cost alone, to 4 percent (in fiscal year 2004/05) to recover full Program costs.
The analysis shows that the expected cost recovery in 2004/05 will be 1.8% if depreciation is
recovered, and will be 3.5% for option 3 and 4.0% for option 4 if debt service is also to be
recovered. Desired cost recovery falls within the assumed combined household expenditure level
of 4 to 6 percent on water and wastewater charges, depending on the year and the recovery
option considered.

E. Proposed Water and Wastewater Tariffs
Tariff principle: Since water connection metering has proven workable, the level of wastewater
service used may easily be determined from the volume of water consumed. The option retained
for recovering wastewater charges is to levy these charges as a percentage of the water tariff,
based on the volume of water consumed, and to combine both charges on one bill. Discharged
wastewater is estimated at 75 to 80 percent of water consumption.
Tariff level: Based on the analysis presented for the cost-recovery options and targets and
household income, wastewater tariffs for domestic users, using the affordability criteria, will be
fixed as a percentage of water charges beginning in fiscal year 1998-99, (i.e. July 1, 1998).
These rates will gradually rise over the years, with the limitation that in they do not exceed the
domestic water charges for that year. The non-domestic charges will be fixed at a rate equal to
water charges as of the same date.
Based on these consideration and the assumption for the proposed water tariffs, the required
wastewater tariffs have been calculated and are presented below: in current and constant prices.

Tariff Structure: the principle retained is that: (i) users will be charged on their wastewater
generation, determined as a percentage of their actual water consumption; and (ii) there will be a
lower tariff for less affluent domestic consumers, with cross-subsidization by more affluent
domestic and non-domestic consumers. Considering overall affordability, the combined cost to
the household for both water and wastewater is relevant since these two originate from the same
utility (water).
Billing and collections of wastewater charges: wastewater charges will appear on the same bill
as the water charges. The bills will be issued and collected by the CWA. CWA will receive, for
these services, a pre-agreed percentage of the arnount collected. All specific stipulations will be
agreed upon by WWA and CWA, to be implemented by July 1, 1998.
F. Affordability Test
The household affordability test for the proposed water and wastewater charges, over the years of
the forecast period, is presented in Table 5-10 below. The results show that the combined
charges are between 3 to 4.6 percent of average household income, at constant income and price
levels, and are affordable given the criteria of a maximum 4 percent expenditure for water and
wastewater for 2002-03 and 5 percent for 2006-07.
The suggested wastewater charges fully meet the operation and maintenance costs, and
depreciation for all years of the covered forecast period. The tariffs can also contribute partially
to the debt service.

G. Future financial projections
The financial forecasts for the period are presented in the proforma tables and tables and graphs
of Annexes 5-01 to 5-1 1. These include wastewater flows and equivalent water flows to be billed,
income statements, sources and uses of funds under the different options (i.e. without the debt
service, with the debt service for onlending external loans only, with the debt service for
onlending the total National Sewerage Program cost), balance sheet and cash analysis graphs and
tariff analysis graphs.
The following assumptions have been made for the financial analysis:
1.    Proposed works under the National Sewerage Program:
1.1.   capital costs estimated for the 13 identified large and medium projects considered fo
priority implementation are as updated by WWA in August 1997 and in January 1998, for the
Montagne Jacquot Sewerage Project and include estimated physical and price contingencies.
1.2.   Physical completion targets for the projects are based on the National Sewerage Program
updated by WWA in December 1997.
1.3.   The Sewerage Connection Investment Program for the forecast period, still to be
finalized, has been estimated to cost about Mau Rs 2.2 billions for the period up to fiscal year
2006/2007, and is to be financed by GOM up to fiscal year 2002/03, and thereafter through
WWA internal sources of funds.
2. Inflation factor:
2.1.   Local inflation assumed is 5 percent over the forecast period.
3. Operation and Maintenance Cost:
3.1.   Existing recurrent costs have been assumed to increase by 5 percent per annum in real
terms.
3.2.   For the proposed projects, the 0 & M costs are based on estimates made by consultants
in project feasibility studies, when available, and on the best judgment estimates when studie
were not available.
4. CWA service fee for billing and collection.
4.1.   For the financial projections, it has been assumed that CWA will receive a 5 percent fee
on collected wastewater revenues for billing and collecting wastewater charges.
5.    Provision for renewal of existing assets.
5.1.   A provision for renewal of existing assets has been considered for the financial
projections. This provision is estimated at about 5 percent of the book value of these assets,
pending revaluation.



Annex 5                                                                     Page 45
6. Depreciation:
6.1.   Depreciation of the fixed assets under WWA management has been computed on the
straight line method on rates based on the following estimated useful life of the new assets
Asset Nature                      Life                Rate
Civil works/ Sea outfalls         40 years            2.5 percent
Equipment/ Materials              15 years            6.67 percent
6.2    The depreciation rate is 4 percent of the estimated value of the existing assets, pending
revaluation.
7. Wastewater Flows and flows to be considered for revenue generation.
7.1.    For revenue projection, wastewater flows have been determined based on possible
coverage by the National Sewerage Program and estimated increases in service demand
generated by the Sewerage Connection Investment Program of about Mau Rs 2.2 billions over
the forecast period ( i.e. an average of about Mau Rs 200 millions per annum). These estimated
wastewater flows have been converted into water flow equivalents for billing and revenue
generation purposes on the basis of a water-to-wastewater conversion rate of 80 percent. A 10
percent allowance has been made for possible demand elasticity response for domestic users; this
becomes a 5 percent allowance for non-domestic users and Government agencies.
8. Long and Medium-Term Debt Service (LMlTD)
8.1.   Two options are considered for the financial projections:
8.2.   Option 1: All external loan funds are assumed to be onlent to the WWA under the above
conditions to carry an average interest at 5 percent, repayable over 20 years excluding the
construction project period 1998-2003. The currency exchange risk has been assumed to be taken
by GOM.
8.3.   Option 2: All National Sewerage Program costs (including GOM  contribution and
external grants) are assumed to be onlent to the WWA under the above conditions to carry an
average interest at 5 percent, repayable over 20 years excluding the construction project period
1998-2003. The currency exchange risk has been assumed to be taken by GOM.
H. Conclusions and Management of the Long and Medium Term Debt
From the overall analysis presented and the forecast financial statements for the period 1998-
2007, it can be concluded that revenues generated through the proposed wastewater tariffs as
percentage of the water tariffs, will allow, as illustrated by the Graph 5-1 1 below:
1. Coverage of the full 0 & M costs in all years;



Annex 5                                                                                     Page 46
2. Coverage of full 0 & M and depreciation in all years, except in fiscal year 2002/2003 when
most of the pumping and treatment facilities become operational;
The financial cash flow generated through the wastewater tariffs fixed at the affordability level
will not allow the full coverage of the debt service, even if, only the external loans to GOM are
onlent to the WWA, at the soft conditions considered.
The cash flows generated can gradually contribute to a higher level of coverage of the debt
service as indicated below in both options of the Debt Service:
Debt Ratio                               2003/2004 2004/2005 2005/2006 2006/2007|

From the above analysis, it was agreed with GOM, that:
1. The infrastructure investment assets for the NSP will not be vested in the new WWA to
be created but will be managed by the new WWA within the framework of the foreseen-
contract ( reflecting the "MaStrise d'Ouvrage deleguee") between GOM and WWA.
2. These assets will remain the property of the State.
3. The liabilities associated with these assets ( long and medium terms debt service) will
therefore not be onlent to the new WWA, and will remain the responsibility of the State.
4. In addition to covering 0 & M and depreciation, the revenues generated from the
proposed tariffs will also contribute partially and gradually to the debt service, through a
"User Fee" and/or a percentage of the free cash flow generated.
5. The modalities and level of the contribution to the debt service through the proposed
tariffs, are to be defined within the foreseen contract (reflecting the "Maitrise d'Ouvrage
deleguee") between GOM and WWA.
H. Financial Analysis- Montagne Jacquot Sewerage project
Internal Financial Rate of Return (IFRR)
The Internal Financial Rate of Return (IFRR), which in constant prices relates the sewerage
revenues to the capital and operating costs of the Montagne Jacquot sewerage facilities, was
computed as an indication of the minimum economic return. The life of the project has been



Annex 5                                                                                                                                                                  Page 48
estimated at 30 years. Revenues attributable to the project were used as a first estimate of the
consumer's willingness to pay in quantifying the estimated internal rate of return for the proposed
project.
The cost stream includes: (i) base costs and physical contingencies for civil works, equipment,
engineering studies, supervision and operation and maintenance for the transport, treatment and
disposal of wastewater for Port Louis South and Lower Beau Bassin/Coromandel; and (ii) the
investment costs for reticulation for additional household and industrial connections ( to be
financed by GOM during the first five years of the forecast period and implemented by WWA).
The IFRR is approximately 8.1%. The IFRR is considered to be acceptable given: (i) the nearly
total lack of cost-recovery mechanisms at present; and (ii) the social nature of the proposed project
with its intangible anticipated health, economic and environmental benefits presented in Annex 4.
The computation of the IFRR is shown below in Table 5-13.

Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, published in January 1997. The borrower's procurement
regulations and procedures have been reviewed and have been found acceptable. As soon as possible, and no
later than by the time of negotiations, a General Procurement Notice is to be prepared by WWA and transmitted
to IBRD for publication in the United Nations Development Businesses to advertise all assignments expected to
be financed by IBRD under the project. Standard bidding and other similar documents published by the Bank
will be used by WWA for the preparation of International Competitive Bidding (ICB) for works and
prequalification documents, and for Requests for Proposals and contracts for consulting services..
Table A below provides information on the project elements and their estimated costs and methods of
procurement, including elements financed by the Bank, as well as those financed by other sources (OECF, GOM,
and private sector).
Procurement of Civil Works. Civil works contracts for the supply and laying of pipelines and sewers and
prequalification of contracts will be procured under ICB in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Procurement for
the OECF parallel-financed construction of sewage pumping stations, the treatment plant and the sea outfall
sewer will be done according to OECF Procurement Guidelines.
Prior and post review by the Bank for Works contracts. All IBRD-financed works contracts above the
threshold of US$ 2,000,000 per contract, and all prequalification documents will be subject to prior review
procedures in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. All other contracts under these thresholds will be subject
to post review.
Procurement of Consulting Services. Recruitment of consulting firrns for the strengthening of WWA, training
of its personnel, supervision of works, sectoral expertise and studies will be carried out under the Quality and
Cost Based Selection method (QCBS) in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Exception to using the QCBS
method will apply to financial audits (Least Cost Selection). Consulting assignments that cost less than US$
200,000 per contract, for which at least three Mauritian firmns are capable, will be recruited on the basis of a short
list of Mauritian firms. Recruitment of individual consultants for assistance to the WWA and/or MPU to carry
out program and/or project implementation will be done on the basis of qualifications and experience in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines.
Prior and post review by the Bank for Consultancy contracts. All consultant contracts expected to cost the
equivalent of US$ 100,000 per contract with firms, and US$ 50,000 per contract with individuals will be subject
to prior review by the Bank. For contracts above $ 200,000 each, the technical evaluation report will be sent for
no-objection to IBRD before opening the financial envelope. All other contracts under these thresholds will be
subject to post review.
These procurement thresholds are summarized in Table B below.

Procurement implementation schedule and advance procurement actions. It was agreed that WWA will
provide by negotiations a detailed timetable for implementation of the investment. This timetable will be used as
a basis for monitoring procurement processing. In particular, the following advance procurement actions have
been identified and agreed on with the GOM and WWA as critical milestones to enable signing of major and
important contracts soon after Loan effectiveness. The following documents will also be prepared by WWA and
transmitted to IBRD for review by negotiations: (a) draft General Procurement Notice; (b) draft Specific
Procurement Notice for the construction works, works supervision, WWA assistance and major studies; (c) draft
prequalification documents for civil works; (d) draft bidding documents for civil works; (e) TORs, short list,
LOI, draft model contract for construction supervision; and (f) TORs, short list, LOI, draft model contract for
WWA Program Management Assistance, and important consulting assignments and studies.
Reporting. It has been agreed with WWA that a monthly progress report up to Loan Effectiveness will be
prepared in sufficient detail and transmitted to IBRD. During project implementation (after effectiveness), a
semestrial report will be adequate. These details will include: major procurement actions dealt with during the
previous months and major procurement actions planned for the following months, an update of the Procurement
Implementation Table, time taken to carry out specific actions such as prequalification, completion of essential
bidding documents, bid evaluation and compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.
Disbursement Arrangements
The total estimated disbursement, covering all sources of funding (IBRD, OECF, GOM and private sector) over
the project life are summarized in the last of the following tables. The total loan proceeds would be disbursed
over five and a half years. IBRD loan disbursements will cover the following percentages indicated below:
Civil Works (US$7.5 million)                         13.1% of total expenditures
Consulting Services (US$4.4 million)                 57.1% of total expenditures excluding taxes
Training (US$0.5 million)                            71.4% of total expenditures excluding taxes
Closing date. The Closing Date is June 30, 2003, six months after completion of project execution (December
31, 2002). The schedule of estimated disbursements is presented in the penultimate table. An aggregate amount
of up to US$300,000 has been included in the project costs to refinance the PPF. This is for expenditures on
engineering and technical expertise devoted to project preparation.
Minimum disbursements. The minimum application amount for payments directly to the Loan account or for
issuance of Special commitments will be US$50,000 equivalent. Disbursements will be fully documented
except that withdrawals will be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures for the items below:
* Civil works contracts not exceeding US$200,000 equivalent;
*  Consulting firm contracts not exceeding US$100,000 equivalent, and individual consultant contracts valued
at less than US$50,000 equivalent.
Special Account. If requested by the Borrower, and to facilitate disbursements against eligible expenditures for
small contracts not exceeding US$250,000 equivalent, a Special Account will be established in the WWA. The
Special Account will be opened and maintained in a commercial bank, acceptable to the Bank, with an
authorized allocation of US$500,000, corresponding to about four months of expenditures. Replenishment
application will be submitted at monthly intervals and will include reconciled bank statements as well as other
appropriate supporting documents.
