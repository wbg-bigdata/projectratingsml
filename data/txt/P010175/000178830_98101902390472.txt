Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:                Kingdom of Nepal
Beneficiary:             Department of Mines and Geology (DMG)
Amount:                  Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) 8.3 million
*                                   ($9.2 million equivalent)
Terms:                   Standard
Project Objectives       The project aims at fostering interest amongst foreign
and Description:         oil companies to explore for petroleum in Nepal. There
has been virtually no exploration for petroleum in
Nepal except for limited surface geology survreys
undertaken during the 1960's. An IDA-financed
aeromagnetic survey in 1980 demonstrated the existence
of thick sedimentary zones and basement anomalies in
the Terai Basin which could be indicative of geologic
structures capable of trapping hydrocarbons. However,
while these indications are encouraging, they are as
yet too preliminary to attract foreign oil companies
to undertake exploration work without the acquisitiont
of substantial additional geological and geophysical
data.
The project would consist of: (i) a seismic survey of
about 800 line-km in the Terai Basin; (ii) preparation
of draft petroleum legislation; (iii) geochemical
analysis and other studies; (iv) exploration
promotion; and (v) training of staff in geology,
geophysics and legal aspects of the petroleum
industry.
The major benefit of the project would be to enhance
the attractiveness of Nepal as a petroleum prospect,
thereby encouraging foreign oil companies to, undertake
the most costly phases of exploration. The project
would also provide temporary employment for some
400-500 laborers.
The major risk is the possibility that the results of
the seismic survey might not be sufficient to attract
foreign oil companies. While this risk is Et real one,
the current project represents the most promising way
for the country to induce exploration in the Kingdom
which could result in major foreign exchange
earnings.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE KINGDOM OF NEPAL FOR A
PETROLEUM EXPLORATION PROMOTION PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Nepal in an amount of Special Drawing
Rights (SDRs) 8.3 million ($9.2 million equivalent) on standard IDA terms to
help finance a Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.      The most recent economic report, "Nepal - Policies and Prospects for
Accelerated Growth" (Report No. 3577-NEP) was distributed to the Executive
Directors on October 15, 1981. The principal findings of the report and
recent developments are described below. Country data are shown -in Annex I.
3.      By almost any standard, Nepal is one of the least developed countries
in the world.  Per capita income is estimated at $140 (1980) and health and
education standards are well below the average for South Asia: life
expectancy at birth is only about 44 years, infant mortality is 150 per
thousand, and adult literacy is only about 20%. The population, estimated
to be 15.0 million (1981), grew at a rate of about 2.7% per year during 1971
to 1981. About 95% of the population live in rural areas.
4.      Population density with respect to arable land has reached alarming
levels and is threatening to overwhelm the resource base of the economy.
Cultivation has been extended beyond economically feasible and ecologically
safe limits in the Hills, and together with denudation of forests to meet
housing and fuel needs, soil erosion has become a critical problem. Firewood
and water have become more difficult to obtain as the forests are reduced
and springs and streams dry up. This degradation of the agricultural base
has made even the present low level of living standards difficult to
maintain, and instances of food shortages and malnutrition have become
commonplace.
5.      Agriculture accounts for nearly 60% of Nepal's GDP and 75% of
merchandise exports, and provides the main source of livelihood to over 90%
of the 'population. Crop production accounts for about 60% of agricultural
output, livestock for 30%, and forestry for 10%. Rice is the predominant
food crop (planted on about half of the total cropped area), followed by
1/ Parts I and II of this report are substantially the same as in the
President's Report (Report No. P-3158-NEP) dated December 3, 1981 for
the Second Education Project in Nepal, distributed to the Executive
Directors under cover of the Secretary's Memorandum IDA/R81-137.



-2-
maize, potatoes, wheat and millet; cash crops (oilseeds, jute, sugar and
tobacco) are grown on about 10% of the cropped area. About 25% of total
rural incomes arise from nonagricultural activities. Cottage industries are
one of the more important of these, engaging over one million people on a
part time basis, and providing basic consumer goods in the many small
isolated markets where such goods would otherwise not be available.
6.      Apart from agricultural land, Nepal's only other important
exploitable resources are hydropower and tourism.  I'he exploitation of the
vast hydropower resources, however, beyond that required to satisfy the
country's own power demand, will depend crucially orn Nepal's ability to enter
complex financial, exploitation and export agreements with neighbouring
countries. The tourism sector, based on Nepal's magnificent landscape and
rich cultural heritage, has been dynamic though it still accounts for only
about 1% of GDP.
7.      When Nepal started its modernization efforts in the early 1950s,
there was virtually no economic or administrative infrastructure, and initial
development efforts were necessarily concentrated on, establishing a
foundation for future development. Investments in the transport sector
absorbed a large part of development spending. The Fifth Development Plan
(1975/76-1979/80) marked a shift in development objectives; acceleration of
economic growth, employment creation and raising living standards of the
population became major plan objectives. Development expenditures rose
fairly rapidly during this period and there were substantial shifts in the
composition of spending away from transport to agriculture, power and social
E2rvices. GDP growth, however, barely kept up witn1 that of population, and
while it was inevitable that per capita income growth would remain slow in
the early stages of development, the continued economic stagnation since the
mid 1970s is disturbing.
8.      Part of the reason for this stagnation lies in factors beyond Nepal's
control. The difficult topography and poor resource base are obviously
important in retarding growth. Nepal½s landlocked position, long open border
with India and the dependence of its overseas trade on transit through India
create additional disadvantages. While Nepal benefits from the proximity of
a vast potential market for Nepalese goods, the ability to pursue independent
economic policy measures is circumscribed. Furthermore, industrial
development faces the competition of a far larger and more efficient
industrial sector in India.
9.      At the same time, factors within Nepal's control have also contri-
buted to the stagnation. Problems with project implementation have been
encountered by Government and donors in most sectors of the economy and have
constrained the growth of the development effort; public sector capital
formation grew at an average of only 5.5% per annum in real terms during the
1970s. In addition, the expected returns on those investments which did take
place often did not materialize because necessary complementary investments



-3-
or current spending were lacking, and because of managerial deficiencies. A
good example is the agriculture sector, where output stagnated despite
considerable investments in irrigation, a virtual doubling of the irrigated
area and a 40% increase in fertilizer use between 1974/75 and 1979/80. In
the past, insufficient attention was paid to bringing water down to the farm
level and this was compounded by inadequate support services such as
extension and research, by the lack of timely supplies of improved seed,
fertilizer and other inputs such as credit, and by the lack of farm-to-market
roads. Recent major irrigation projects financed by IDA and the Asian
Development Bank are now addressing some of these problems by taking more
*        comprehensive and integrated approaches.
10.     Although Government revenue efforts have improved considerably over
time, revenues have by now only reached the equivalent of about 9% of GDP,
which is low by international standards. With limited domestic resources,
current expenditures have been squeezed in an effort to generate savings for
investment spending, with the result that the efficiency of total spending
was lowered. Furthermore, while about one quarter of total budgetary
expenditures (regular and development) was being financed by the rest of the
world in 1974/75, this proportion rose to close to 40% by 1979/80.
11.     The disappointing economic performance has been accompanied by a
widening trade deficit. Import payments have grown while the trend in export
earnings has been sluggish due to declining rice exports. The deterioration
on the trade account has been partly covered by increased tourism receipts
and remittances, which together with foreign assistance in the form of grants
and concessionary financing have generally ensured that the overall lbalance
remained in surplus. But even so, foreign exchange reserves have declined
from being equivalent to about one year of imports in 1974 to six months in
1981.
12.     The poor monsoon in 1979 resulted in foodgrain production falling by
13% in 1979/80 and GDP declining by 1%. Better weather resulted in the
recovery of agricultural production in 1980/81, and together with the
favorable impact this had on other sectors of the economy, GDP grew by about
6-7% in 1980/81. Export performance also improved in 1980/81 due to a
recovery in agricultural exports. But the underlying economic trends remain
disappointing. Paddy production in 1981/82 is estimated to have increased by
only 0.7% and overall GDP growth is unlikely to be substantially in excess of
the population growth rate.
13.     On September 19, 1981 Nepal unified its exchange rate with the US
dollar at NRs 13.2 = Si; the exchange rate with the Indian rupee was
unchanged at NRs 145 = 100. This is the latest in a series of steps to
reform Nepal's exchange rate system which began when a complex system of
multiple exchange rates and trade restrictions for overseas trade waLs
replaced with a dual exchange system on March 31, 1978. A basic rate of
NRs 12 = $1 was applied for invisible and capital transactions as well as



-4-
for imports of petroleum products, fertilizer, and cement. A second rate
applying to all other merchandise trade was set at NRs 16 = $1, which was
subsequently changed to NRs 14 = $1 on February 21, 1980. The September 1981
measures devalued the basic rate by 9% but resulted in a 6% appreciation for
most overseas merchandise trade. The latter could adversely affect the
balance of overseas trade.
14.     During the past two to three years economic policy making has been
delayed by political developments. Following disturbanices in 1979, a
referendum was held in May 1980, which reaffirmed the existing partyless
system, with suitable reforms. The constitution was amended in December 1980
to provide, among other things, for direct election of members of parliament;
general elections were held in May 1981, though they were boycotted by many
opposition groups. The previous Prime Minister and Finance Minister have
retained their portfolios in the post election government. For the moment,
however, the political situation appears to have stabilized and the
Government has been able to focus its attention on economic problems and on
implementing the Sixth Plan (1980/81-1984/85).
15.     The Sixth Plan  reflects Nepal's determination to search for ways to
overcome stagnation and, as a set of objectives, it was endorsed by members
of the Nepal Aid group at its December 1981 meeting. T'he strategy to shift
investment into more productive sectors, which was initiated during the Fifth
Plan, is continued and emphasis is given to alleviating some of the factors
that limited past growth. The Plan's principal objectives are to increase
production at a faster rate, to increase productive employment, and to meet
basic minimum needs in food, fuel (firewood), drinking water, health
services, primary education and rural transportation. The strategy: (i)
accords high priority to developing agriculture, small-scale industries and
Nepal's abundant water resources; (ii) stresses soil conservation and
population control; and (iii) emphasizes full utilization of existing
infrastructure and alleviation of absorptive capacity constraints. The
development strategy also calls for full involvement of the private sector in
agriculture, manufacturing, trade, tourism, construction and transport
operations.
16.     Achieving the Plan's objectives will require quick-yielding sector
programs to generate growth in the short to medium-term as well as human
resource development programs to lay the foundation for sustained growth in
the longer term. Program targets must also be made consistent with overall
financial and implementation capacity, but at the same time vigorous measures
are needed to remove administrative and domestic financial constraints. The
Government has been considering the actions required to overcome the
administrative constraints. A full list would include a slowing down in the
growth of government employment and the proliferation of public sector
agencies; an overhaul of the present incentive system, including substantial
salary increases for senior officials; and a more professional approach in



-5-
the management of public enterprises. Recently, a civil service Pay
Commission was established to review salaries and benefits; measures to
streamline economic decision-making and project implementation were
announced; and an administrative staff college was set up to train sector
employees.
17.     There also is considerable scope for easing the financial constraints
and the Government plans to improve revenue administration, operate public
enterprises more efficiently and to raise public utility charges over a
period of years. Selective increases in indirect taxes would also provide
substantial additional revenues, while phasing out fertilizer subsidies and
streamlining rice subsidies could yield substantial savings. To strengthen
domestic resource mobilization, the Government recently set up a revenue
training center; liquidated some public enterprises; and decided to phase out
rice and fertilizer subsidies in the relatively higher-income Kathmandu
Valley.
18.     Nepal has received substantial external assistance in the past.  Aid
commitments averaged $160 million per year during the Fifth Plan, and,
according to current indications, could average about $300 million per year
during 1981/82-1983/84. Foreign assistance is expected to account for about
53% of total development spending during the Sixth Plan period. However,
even this level of foreign assistance would not provide the Government with
sufficient resources to meet increasing consumption demands. Additional aid,
either through financing a higher proportion of total project costs or in the
form of commodity assistance, could provide budgetary support to melet
pressing recurrent expenditure requirements, particularly in the so,zial
sectors. The Nepal Aid Group was formed in 1976 to assist in the overall
coordination of financial and technical assistance efforts and the Group now
accounts for some 70% of all aid disbursements. The Group has met four times
at plenary meetings under the chairmanship of the Bank to discuss overall
external assistance needs; local Aid Group meetings in Kathmandu are also
held to discuss and coordinate sectoral development strategies.
19.     Foreign aid disbursements grew by 29% annually during the Fifth Plan
period; only about 40% of disbursements were from foreign borrowings, the
remainder being grants. As of December 31, 1980, official foreign debt
outstanding was $177 million, of which $144 million was due to multilateral
agencies. These loans were obtained on a highly concessional basis and the
grant element of total aid remains in excess of 70%. As a result, debt
service payments were only $4.0 million during 1980, equivalent to less than
2% of exports of goods and services.

PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NEPAL
20.     Bank Group operations in Nepal began in FY70 with an IDA credit of
$1.7 million equivalent for a telecommunications project. Since then, 27
additional credits have been approved, bringing total IDA assistance to Nepal
to $317.4 million equivalent, net of cancellations. In view of Nepal's many
development needs, this assistance has been for projects in a wide variety of
sectors. Six of these sectors account for 81% of IDA credits by amount:
irrigation/agriculture ($110.2 million for nine projects); water supply and
sewerage ($46.8 million for three projects), power ($40.8 million for one
project); telecommunications ($21.7 million for three projects); highways
($19.2 million for two projects); and rural development ($19.0 million for
two projects). The proposed credit would be the third in FY82, bringing the
total amount of IDA assistance to Nepal to $326.6 million equivalent, net of
cancellations. No Bank loans have been made to Nepal. IFC made its first
investment in Nepal ($3.1 million) in a hotel project in Kathmandu in FY75.
In addition, IFC approved a loan of S6.23 million equivalent to Nepal Orind
Magnesite (Private) Limited (i.e. a private company) on March 16, 1982. The
loan was to help finance a $24.9 million project to mine and process
magnesite ore. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group
operations as of March 31, 1982, and notes on the execution of ongoing IDA
projects. It shows certain delays in the implementation of some of these
projects, particularly during the initial periods. The delays have been
largely due to Nepal's limited technical and managerial capabilities. In
order to assist Nepal in coping with this constraint, considerable technical
assistance is being given by Bank Group staff, including our Resident
Representative in Kathmandu. As a result, the rate of disbursements is
improving; during FY81, $27.7 million equivalent was disbursed compared to
$65.1 million equivalent disbursed during the entire previous 10 years.
Project completion reports have been prepared for three projects--First
Telecommunications (Credit No.166, $1.7 million equivalent), First Highways
(Credit No. 223, $2.2 million equivalent), and Tourism (Credit No. 291, $3.2
million equivalent). All three projects experienced delays in
implementation, and institutional improvements were less than anticipated;
however, all three generated acceptable rates of return.
21.     Bank Group lending to Nepal has so far been at a modest level
compared to the country's need for external assistance.  The international
community has shown considerable interest in Nepal's economic development
and, to date, shortage of funds has not been a bottleneck. The main
constraint on the utilization of increased aid has been Nepal's limited
absorptive capacity, affecting the pace of project preparation and
implementation. The Bank is assisting the Government in project preparation
through the Technical Assistance Credit (Credit No. 659-NEP, $3.0 million
equivalent) and by acting as Executing Agency for a number of technical
assistance projects financed by UNDP. The Bank Group has also addressed the



-7-
problem of absorptive capacity through its role in organizing the Aid Group
for Nepal (para 18).
22.     The Bank Group's current strategy places major emphasis uporn the
directly productive sectors (particularly agriculture) and the development of
complementary infrastructure, including feeder roads (particularly connecting
the Hills to the Terai), communications and hydroelectric power. Preparation
of projects in irrigation, forestry, leather industry, cash crops, manpower
development and hydroelectric power is underway.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR
Background
23.     Nepal's total energy consumption was only 2.8 million tons of oil
equivalent in FY79. Average per capita consumption (200 kg of oil
equivalent) is one of the lowest of all developing countries. Energy
consumption is almost totally based on non-commercial sources, primarily on
wood (over 90% of total energy consumption). Petroleum products, totally
imported, account for only 4% of energy consumption, and are primarily used
in transportation. Knowledge of Nepal's petroleum potential is very limited
since petroleum exploration has been almost nonexistent until now. An
important advance in information about the country's potential has been
through the IDA-financed aeromagnetic survey in 1979/80 which has indicated
the likely presence of thick sedimentary zones capable of trapping
hydrocarbon accumulations. The results of this survey have been sufficiently
encouraging to warrant further investment in evaluating Nepal's petroleum
potential with a view to determining whether there exist good prospects for
finding commercially and economically exploitable quantities of petroleum.
Energy Resources and Consumption
24.    Medium-Term Resources.   Nepal is endowed with considerable hydro
potential. The Kingdom's theoretical hydro power resources are currently
estimated at 83,000 MW (firm) corresponding to 727,000 GWh, out of which
18,000 MW (installed) corresponding to 80,000 GWh, could be economically
developed. Only 53 MW have so far been harnessed. The commissioning of the
Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project, partly financed by IDA (Credit 600-NEP), has
added 60 MW to the country's generating capacity in 1982, and the Divaghat
Project, financed by India and scheduled for completion in 1984, arnother 14
MW. In the medium-term, Nepal intends to meet its internal power consumption
through the construction of the Marsyangdi (66 MW) and Kulekhani II (30 MW)
projects by 1987, and Sapta Gandaki (150 MW) by 1990.
25.    Future Potential.  In the future, besides securing its own internal
consumption, Nepal's hydroelectric power potential could be the largest known



-8-
and still untapped potential source of foreign exchange earnings for the
Kingdom. The two largest projects identified are the Chisapani Project (3500
MW) and the Pancheswar Project (2000 MW).  Initial studies for these projects
will be prepared in the framework of Nepal's Sixth and Seventh Development
Plans. These projects are, however, characterized by their high capital
requirements and the long lead time required for the feasibility studies and
construction. They will also imply reaching internatiLonal agreements with
neighboring coulntries regarding the use of tho waters, and on the sale of
power.
26.     Firewood and Forests.  Firewood accounts for 97% of non-commercial
energy consumption, and over 90% of all energy used in Nepal. The area under
forest in Nepal is currently about 4.5 million ha; 2.8 million ha in the
hills and mountains and 1.7 million ha in the plains (Terai). The growing
stock is estimated at about 150 million cubic meters, and the annual yield at
7.3 million cubic meters. However, forested areas have decreased by about
25% over the last 15 years, and at this rate, accessible forest could
disappear in the hills in about 14 years and within 25 years in the Terai.
Such deforestation rates would lead to an extensive erosion of soil resulting
in increased consumption of animal dung for purposes of domestic heating and
cooking, thus displacing its use as a fertilizer. In order to meet the
demand for fuelwood, Nepal will require about 1.3 million ha of plantation
and, therefore, community forestry development is a component of several
development projects: Chautara Division Forestry Project (Australia),
Lamasangu-Jiri Rural Development Project (Switzerland), and Sagarnath
forestry project (Asian Development Bank). Forestry activities are also
included in the IDA-financed Rural Development Project (Credit 617-NEP) and
the Community Forestry Development and Training Project (Credit 1008-NEP).
27.     Other Energy Sources.  Agricultural wastes account for less than 2%
of the consumption of non-commercial energy and animal wastes for 1%. Solar
energy utilization remains at an early stage of development and the abundant
wind energy available in the northern mountains remains unexploited. Studies
are, however, being undertaken in selected areas, such as the region of
Khumbu and the Kali Gandaki Basin, which exhibit high and steady wind speeds.
Some marsh gas deposits in Kathmandu valley (estimated at 1.4 billion cubic
feet) are being partially exploited for domestic cooking and heating.
28.     Energy Consumption.  Total energy consumption increased only slowly
at about 3% a year, over the last decade. In FY79, non-commercial sources of
energy accounted for 94% of total energy (firewood 91%, agricultural waste
2%, and animal waste 1%). The commercial sources accounted for the remaining
6% (petroleum 4%, coal 1%, and electricity 1%).  The domestic sector consumes
95% of the total energy use in Nepal, and the commercial and industrial
sectors 2.5%. The transportation sector absorbs the remaining 2.5%, although
it accounts for more than 56% of the petroleum fuel used in the country.

Sector Institutions
29.     There are three ministries involved in the energy sector.  The
Ministry of Water Resources oversees the management and use of water as well
as power generation. The Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation monitors
fuelwood use in the country. The responsibility for oil and gas exploration
is vested in the Department of Mines and Geology, within the Ministry of
Industry. The Government created, in 1976, the Water and Energy Commission
(within the Ministry of Water Resources), with the responsibility for
designing the framework for overall energy planning in Nepal. Since 1977,
the Commission has been receiving assistance under an aid program financed by
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) to develop an integrated
energy planning system.
The Petroleum Subsector
30.      Background.  Nepal's per capita consumption of petroleum products
(7 kg of oil equivalent in 1979) is one of the lowest in the world.
Nevertheless, petroleum imports impose a heavy burden on Nepal's balance of
payments. Imports in FY80 were $30 million and accounted for 32% of the
export earnings for that year. 1/ Petroleum exploration has been negligible
in the past, apart from limited surface geology in the 1960s and an
IDA-financed aeromagnetic survey performed in 1980. The government's
exploration strategy is aimed at inducing foreign oil companies to undertake
the high-risk and costly exploration drilling phase in those areas of the
country, especially the Terai Basin, where prospects are most favcrable.
31.     Demand for Petroleum Products.  Demand for petroleum products
amounted to about 100,000 tons of oil equivalent of refined products in FY79.
Demand has increased by about 8.5% per year in the last five years. In FY79,
diesel accounted for 51% of total consumption of refined products, kerosene
for 29%, aviation turbine fuel for 10% and gasoline for 10%. The consumption
pattern is characterized by the prominence of the transportation sector (56%
of total consumption of refined products) and of the domestic sect:or (29%);
on the other hand, the low consumption of the industrial/commercial sectors
(11%) is indicative of the low level of industrialization and of Nepal's
reliance on traditional energy.
*           32.      Supply of Petroleum Products.  Demand is met totally through imports.
Nepal Oil Corporation (NOC) imports high speed diesel oil from the USSR under
a long-term contract and secures kerosene on the spot market. These products
are delivered to India, which in turn provides Nepal with the mix of refined
products it requires, according to an agreed pricing formula. Since 1978,
NOC has had a policy of constructing storage facilities for petroLeum
1/ In FY81, petroleum imports totalled $37 million.



-10-
products sufficient to provide, in case of interruption of supply, two months
of consumption for all regions of the Kingdom. This objective has already
been met for both the central and eastern parts of Nepal.
33.     Petroleum Products Pricing.  The government has succeeded in
maintaining the sale prices of liquid fuels at a level much higher than the
total of import cust p>-s transportation charges as shown in the table below:
Prices of Selected Petroleum Products in Nepal
$/ton
Product           Retail Price        Border Price 1/
(February 1982)
Gasoline               958                 400
Kerosene               466                 374
Diesel                 510                 330
The weighted average price/ton of petroleum products is estimated at
approximately $550 per ton (equivalent to $70 per barrel). Resource
mobilization stemming from the sale of petroleum products remained at about
$9 million for both FY79 and FY80. The government levies a sales tax of 10%
on gasoline, 5% on diesel and none on kerosene. The import duties account
for 92% of the import cost of gasoline, 25% for diesel and 13% for kerosene.
Petroleum Exploration
34.     Institutional Framework.  The Department of MiLnes and Geology (DMG)
of the Ministry of Industry is responsible for petroleum exploration in
Nepal. Oil and gas exploration, however, is a relatively minor component of
the activities of DMG, absorbing only 17% of DMG allocation in its FY82
budget. DMG staff includes about 50 geologists, but only a few with
petroleum experience.
35.     Legal Framework.  The Natural Gas and Oil Concession Rules (BE 2015)
of 1958 govern exploration activities in Nepal. In 1977, a consultant to the
government prepared a draft of a revised petroleum law and a model
production-sharing agreement. However, this proposed legislation was never
enacted and is now inadequate; the existing law urgently needs to be revised
to make it suitable for participation by foreign oil companies. Under the
project, a legal consultant is being employed to review this draft and
propose suitable petroleum legislation (para 45).

Past Exploration Efforts and Current Exploration Strategy
36.     Petroleum exploration in Nepal prior to 1980 was limited to a few
reconnaissance surveys of the surface geology. In 1980 an airborne
magnetometer survey of the Terai was made by an international contractor for
DMG, financed by part of an IDA technical assistance credit (Credit 659-NEP).
This survey indicated the presence of a deep geological trough underlying the
Terai, presumably filled with sedimentary rocks which were as much as 6,000
meters thick in places. This survey also showed evidence of geological
structures which might be suitable for trapping oil and gas.
37.     The past lack of interest in petroleum exploration in Nepal results
from a number of factors, including uncertainty as to the presence and
thickness of geological structures in the Terai; a general opinion that the
rocks exposed at the surface (the Siwalik series) were unsuitable for
petroleum formation and accumulation; and the lack of adequate petroleum
legislation.
38.     The airborne magnetometer survey has to some extent resolved the
question regarding the thickness of sedimentary rocks and geological
structure of the Terai, and further information on these points should be
provided by the proposed seismic survey (para 43). A geological study of the
petroleum prospects of Nepal, which was made subsequent to the airborne
survey, concluded that older sedimentary rocks, which are exposed in the
mountains north of the project area, might have acted as petroleum source
rocks and might be present beneath the Siwalik series. Further information
on the oil source-rock potential of Nepal should be provided by the proposed
analysis of selected rock samples to be made during the project. Positive
indications that oil and gas have been formed at some point in the geological
history of Nepal is provided by the existence of seepages of oil and gas in
the mountains about 40 km north of the project area.
39.     The conclusion to be drawn from the existing information is that
further petroleum exploration of the Terai area is justified. Whi:Le a
promotional effort could be undertaken on the basis of the aeromagnetic
survey alone, the preferred strategy is to conduct a seismic program before
inviting proposals from foreign oil companies for several reasons. First,
the chances of attracting oil companies to undertake even seismic work in the
country are estimated to be small at this stage.  Even if an early
promotional effort were successful, it would most probably delay the start of
the reconnaissance seismic work in the country by at least one year because
of the constraints imposed by the monsoon season.  Secondly, and more
importantly, a prior knowledge of the potential is required to design fiscal
terms and contractual arrangements which would take into account the unusual
geographical (landlocked) and economic (very low petroleum demand) parameters
of Nepal. For these reasons, we believe that Nepal would be in a better
position to negotiate financial terms and a minimum work program once it has
the necessary additional knowledge of the geology of the Terai Basin. The



-12-
proposed seismic survey and the source-rock analysis are, therefore, regarded
as the most promising ways to attract private investments in Nepal for
exploration.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Introduction
40.     The proposed project was identified by an IDA mission to Nepal in
January 1981, and was appraised in November 1981. In August 1981, the
Government requested an advance from the Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
for a total amount of $300,000. This PPF, which is being used for financing
part of the geophysical consultancy, legal assistance and training to prepare
the project, was approved on September 22, 1981. The PPF would be refinanced
under the proposed IDA credit. A timetable of key events relating to the
project and the special conditions of the proposed credit are given in Annex
III. Negotiations were held in Washington from April 26 to April 29, 1982.
The Nepalese delegation was headed by Mr. Rana, Director-General, Department
of Mines and Geology.
Project Objectives and Description
41.     The project's main objective is to induce foreign oil companies to
undertake petroleum exploration in Nepal by helping to enhance the knowledge
of the most prospective areas of the Terai Basin through a limited
reconnaissance seismic survey, aimed at identifying favorable geological
structures. The project would also help develop appropriate oil and gas
legislation. The training component would improve the limited local
expertise in petroleum geology, geophysics and petroleum legislation. If
Nepal is successful in its promotional efforts, assistance will be provided
under the project during negotiations with foreign oil companies. The
project comprises: (a) seismic survey, geochemical analysis and geological
studies; (b) preparation of petroleum legislation; (c) exploration promotion;
and (d) training.
42.     Geophysical Consultancy.  DMG will employ an international
geophysical consulting firm to (a) prepare detailed specifications for the
seismic survey; (b) carry out supervision of the seismic survey contractor
and quality control of the survey on behalf of the Government; (c)
interpretation of survey results; (d) provide DMG with the services of an
experienced geologist to update the knowledge of petroleum geology of the
Terai Basin; (e) prepare a short strategy report for DMG for approaching                       S
foreign oil companies; (f) prepare a promotional report for presentation to
the oil companies; (g) help DMG evaluate oil companies proposals; and (h)
support DMG during negotiations with interested oil companies.



-13-
43.     Seismic Survey.  A reconnaissance seismic survey of about 800 line-km
would be undertaken in the Terai Basin to identify prospective geological
structures. The survey would be carried out by a specialist seismic survey
contractor active in the international field. Given the rough, forested
terrain and the numerous rivers in the area, the survey using a helicopter is
expected to take about 8 crew-months in the field, and it would have to be
timed during the dry, inter-monsoon period, starting in September and ending
in June. It would take four months to process the data, and interpretation
would be undertaken by the geophysical consulting firm. The survey would
involve the temporary hiring of about 400-500 local workers during the
preparation and shooting stages.
44.     Geochemical Analyses and Other Studies.  The project would include
a program of rock sampling and geochemical analyses and paleontological
determination of fossils to determine whether any of the rock formations
exposed at the surface have the potential to be petroleum source-rocks.
Collection of rocks would be made by Nepalese geologists and analyrses of
these rocks would be done by a specialized consultant. The project would
further include geological studies to be undertaken by DMG geologists in the
Lesser Himalayas to check on the stratigraphic section, the oil and gas seeps
and the structural trends that could reflect on the seismic interlpretation.
45.     Petroleum Legislation.  A draft petroleum law was prepared in January
1977 by a consultant to the government but was never enacted. This draft
needs to be updated. In addition, a model exploration/production agreement
including, inter alia, tax clauses and work obligations appropriate for a
foreign oil company exploring under Nepalese conditions must be prepared.
Besides advising Nepal on its petroleum legislation and model exploration/
production agreement, the legal consultant would, on an as-needed basis,
assist the government in its negotiations with foreign oil companies.
46.     Training.  The purpose of the training component would be to enhance
the capabilities of DMG staff in petroleum matters. Initially this component
would be limited to a few basic courses, seminars, and on the job training.
However, depending on the outcome of the proposed project, additional
training could be provided (Section 3.06 (b) of the Development Credit
Agreement).
47.     In its first phase, the training component would include (a) on the
job training. As part of their terms of reference, the geophysical and legal
consultants, as well as the seismic contractor are required to include on the
job training for professional staff of DMG; (b) basic courses in petroleum
legislation and geophysics; (c) professional seminars. The second phase,
depending on the result of the promotional effort, would consist of selected
courses for DMG personnel in (a) petroleum legislation; (b) drilling
techniques; (c) geophysics; (d) micropaleontology/palynology: and (e)
sedimentology.



-14-
Cost Estimates
48.     The total cost of the project, net of duties aLnd taxes, is estimated
at $10.9 million. The proposed IDA credit of $9.2 million would finance the
foreign exchange component of the project costs. Local costs ($1.7 million)
would be financed by the Government. A Project Preparation Facility (PPF)
for an overall amount of $300,000 was approved in September 1981 to help the
Government prepare the project. This PPF would be refinanced under this
credit.  The cost of geophysical consultancy services has been estimated at
$16,500 per manmonth including travel, computer services, subsistence and
overhead. The cost of legal consulting services has been estimated at $150
per hour. These fees for consultancy services are reasonable taking into
account the level of fees prevailing in the petroleum industry. The cost of
the seismic survey has been estimated on the basis of surveys performed in
comparable environments. Total contingencies amount to $1.8 million or about
20% of base cost estimates. Cost estimates are summarized in the Credit and
Project Summary.
Project Implementation
49.     DMG would be responsible for implementing the project and would set
up a special unit, staffed with 10 professionals, for this purpose. This
unit would include a full-time project coordinator; a petroleum geologist;
a geophysicist; a specialized lawyer experienced in petroleum legislation;
and an administrative officer. The establishment of this unit with the
agreed professional staff and support services would be a condition of
effectiveness (Sections 3.02 and 5.01 of the Development Credit Agreement).
Project implementation would depend heavily on the consultants to the
Government. The legal consulting firm would be responsible for updating the
petroleum legislation. The legal consultants have been selected; they are
expected to complete a preliminary draft of a revised petroleum law by Fall,
1982. The geophysical consultants would supervise the design and
arrangements for the seismic survey, and would ensure quality control of the
shooting and processing. These consultants have also been selected. The
seismic survey would be undertaken by a specialized contractor who would be
hired in August 1982, and the survey would actually be carried out from
October 1982 to April 1983 with the processing of the data in the next four
months. It is expected that the interpretation of the seismic survey would
be available by July 1983. Promotional reports could be prepared by the
geophysical consultant in September 1983 and negotiations with oil companies
for further exploration work could start early in CY 1984.
50.     The results of the seismic survey would be available for sale to
interested oil companies. In the event of such sales, the Government has
agreed to record the proceeds in a separate account. Funds equivalent to
these proceeds would be made available for further exploration work or
strengthening of DMG if justified in the light of the results of the project
(Section 4.02 of the Development Credit Agreement).



-15-
Procurement and Disbursement
51.     The contracts with the geophysical and legal consultants would be
awarded following IDA "Guidelines for the use of consultants". The contract
for the seismic survey would be awarded following international competitive
bidding in accordance with IDA procurement guidelines. Material and
equipment amounting to $420,000 would be procured following international
shopping with at least three bids. Disbursements from the proposed Credit
would be made against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures for the seismic
survey; (b) 100% of foreign expenditures for materials and equipment; (c)
100% of foreign expenditures for consultant services and training; and (d)
refinancing of the advance under the PPF.
Benefits and Risks
52.     Nepal is still a virtually unexplored country (para 36).  While the
recent results from the aeromagnetic survey have been favorable, they are
still insufficient to attract foreign oil companies to the country to conduct
exploration. The proposed project should, therefore, be viewed as the most
promising way for Nepal to induce foreign oil companies to undertake the most
costly phases of exploration in the Kingdom. The seismic survey would
provide additional geological information needed to substantiate the
existence of prospective geological formations; a small percentage of the
costs incurred in undertaking the seismic survey would be recovered by the
sale of the data to interested oil companies. At the same time, a major
benefit derived from the project would be the design of an appropriate
legislative framework which would be attractive to oil companies while at the
same time protecting Nepal's interests. Finally, Nepal would benefit from
this project through training of its staff in the oil and gas sector, and if
successful, through direct assistance during negotiations with oil companies.
53.     Risks.  The major risk involved in the project is that the result of
the seismic survey might not be sufficient to attract foreign oil companies.
The survey could indicate that Nepal is a poor prospect; it is also possible
that its results could be insufficiently clear to improve substantially the
knowledge of the Terai Basin. There is finally a risk that even positive
results of the seismic survey, together with an attractive legislation, might
not be sufficient to attract foreign investments. The landlocked position of
Nepal could be a dampening factor in promotional efforts.  While these risks
are real, the proposed project still represents the most promising way to
attract oil companies to explore in Nepal. There is a good prospect that the
*            proposed seismic survey will demonstrate the existence of potential
structures. In that case, an improved legislative framework, the knowledge
of oil and gas seeps occuring north of the Basin, the active exploration
activity undertaken in neighboring areas of India, and the information gained
from the aeromagnetic survey, are all factors which should enhance the



-16-
attractiveness of Nepal in its attempt to induce exploration activities by
foreign oil companies.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
54.     The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of Nepal
and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to
the Executive Directors separately.
55.     Special conditions of the project are listed in Section III of
Annex III. A special condition of effectiveness is that a project
implementation unit with requisite staff is established.
56.     I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
57.     I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed Credit.

Credit No. 373 Birganj Irrigation Project $6.0 million Credit of April 18,
1973; Effective Date: July 9, 1973; Closing Date:
June 30, 1981
The project was successfully completed in mid-1981. Crop yields
achieved in irrigated areas are promising. Water charges are now being
levied in a limited area, and farmers acceptance is satisfactory. A project
completion report is being prepared.
Credit No. 397  Telecommunications Project II $5.5 million Credit of
June 20, 1973; Effective Date: September 11, 1.973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Procurement for switching equipment was initially delayed due to
difficulties with the selected bidder after award decision and the need for
rebidding. The procurement for this item has subsequently been combined in
one tender with procurement for a similar equipment under the third project.
The project is expected to be completed in mid-1984.

Credit No. 470 Water Supply and Sewerage Project $11.8 million Credit of
May 8, 1974; Effective Date: June 26, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
After a long mobilization period project impilementation has been
making much better progress. The project is expected to be completed before
the revised closing date. Contracts of two experts provided by the British
Overseas Development Administration were extended till mid-1982 to continue
assistance for WSSB in operation of water production and distribution
facilities and in water quality control and surveillance.
Credit No. 505 Settlement Project $6.0 million Credit of August 14, 1974;
Effective Date: February 20, 1975; Closing Date; July 15,
1982
Project implementation has been far behind schedule. By the Closing
Date, only about two-fifths of the originally planned land will be cleared
and around one-third of families settled. Due to continuing doubts about
land use, timber extraction and timber export policiies, the Project is being
closed on schedule, i.e. July 15, 1982.
Credit No.600   Kulekhani Hydroelectric Project; $40.8 million Credit of
January 9, 1976; Effective Date:  May 18, 1976; Closing
Date:  December 31, 1982
Reservoir impounding commenced on June 9, 1981. When headrace tunnel
was tested with water for first time on November 8, 1981, water leakages were
observed, which on subsequent investigation, were found due to inadequate
grouting. Immediate rectification work was started and a panel of experts
was also set up by the Bank to suggest remedial steps. With the approval of
the panel of experts, the tunnel was refilled with waLter and Unit No.1 was
commissioned on March 13, 1982. Since that date, all restrictions on the use
of electricity in the central grid system of Nepal have been removed. Unit
No.2 has also been commissioned since March 29, 1982.
Some more repairs are to be undertaken on the underground works in
next coming weeks. All works at the project site are however expected to
be completed by end July, 1982. The present cost estimate is $119.93 mil-
lion, including taxes and duties but excluding any claims by contractors.
The foreign portion of the cost estimate is $98.39 million. The Government
of Nepal is evaluating the claims to work out the total cost.

Credit No. 617  Rural Development Project; $8.0 million Credit of April 30,
1976; Effective Date:  July 15, 1976; Closing Date:
March 31, 1983
Until about the end of 1980, implementation progress had been satis-
factory for most of the components (except health, education and livestock
development) and nearly 70-80% of physical targets had been achieved.
However, implementation has been unsatisfactory since early 1981 due to (a)
inadequate local funding of the project, (b) poor management and coordination
of project activities, (c) inadequate control and supervision of the
activities of the Panchayats involved in construction work, ancd (d) the
inability of the new Ministry of Local Development to provide leadership in
matters of programming and implementing activities of the various line minis-
tries. Since early 1982, the situation has improved somewhat with HMG having
released the required funds and administrative action to improve implementa-
tion having been initiated.
Credit No. 654 Bhairawa - Lumbini Groundwater Project; $9.0 million
Credit of July 9, 1976; Effective Date: November 16, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1982
More than 50 of the 63 planned tubewells have been constructed and
drilling is to be completed by mid-1982. Progress of project implementation
is slow due to the weakness of local contractors. However, all civil works
contracts have been awarded and the project is scheduled for completion by
early 1983. HMG has requested IDA assistance for a follow-up Stage II
project which would concentrate on ensuring effective operation and main-
tenance of the infrastructure built under Stage I.
Credit No. 659 Technical Assistance Project $3.0 million Credit of
September 16, 1976; Effective Date:  November 16, 1976;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
With the recent addition of the Marsyangdi Technical Review Panel,
second phase of the Cash Crop Development and the Primary School Mapping,
there is now a total of five ongoing subprojects under the technical assis-
tance credit. These are proceeding satisfactorily. Many of the subprojects
financed under the technical assistance credit have been completed and con-
tributed to the pipeline of bankable projects in Nepal. Because of the new
subprojects it is expected that the credit will be extended for another year.
Credit No. 704 Second Water Supply and Sewerage Project; $8.0, million
Credit of May 27, 1977; Effective Date: February 28, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The project had a slow start as Credit effectiveness was extended
several times due to delays in engaging engineering consultants. There have



-26-
ANNEX II
Page 5
also been delays in procurement but the problems are being resolved satisfac-
torily. Project completion is estimated to take albout 9 months beyond the
existing credit closing date.  Institutional and financial evaluations are
explained under Credit 1059-NEP.
Credit No. 705  Nepal Industrial Development Corporation Project; $4.0
million Credit of May 27, 1977; Effective Date:  February 17,
1978; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
On September 9, 1981 IDA lifted its "inforTmal" suspension of Credit
705-NEP and as of March 31, 1982 (latest date of subloan authorization) NIDC
has fully committed the $4.0 million Credit. Close supervision is planned to
ensure further improvements in NIDC's operations and implementation of sub-
projects and disbursements of Credit 705-NEP within the closing date of
December 31, 1983.
Credit No. 730 Second Highway Project; $17.0 million Credit of October 19,
1977; Effective Date: December 23, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
The project is now moving steadily towards a successful conclusion,
though there remain several areas where improved performance is required.
Procurement, which has been a source of considerable delay in the past, is
now virtually complete. The work on the Thankot-Naubise road pavement, after
a virtual halt in January-March 1982, has been resumed, and is now proceeding
at a good pace. Much supervisory attention is currently being given to the
Tulsipur feeder road in an effort to improve performance on a number of
wayward contracts. Disbursements, which currently stand at 61% of appraisal
estimates, are expected to improve substantially over the next half year.
An extension of closing date beyond December 1982 is certain to be needed and
an appropriate application is expected from Government in the near future.
Credit No. 772 Technical Education Project; $5.7 million Credit of
April 14, 1978; Effective Date: July 11, 1978; Closing
Date: September 30, 1983
In most respects the project has been managed well by the IOE
implementation unit, and the various project activities have been running
on schedule with the exception of civil works construction which slowed down
during the second year due to a severe shortage of cement and bricks.
Although this problem caused a 12 month delay, the issue is now resolved and
progress in the building components, which are about 30% complete, has
steadily improved during the last 12 months, and completion may still be
effected within the credit closing date of September 1983. The technical
assistance program financed by the ODA of UK has been progressing satisfac-
torily. Recent project issues being addressed by the Institute of Engineer-
ing are of an educational nature concerning: (1) possible pressure on

engineers for on-going projects in Nepal; and (2) internal inefficiencies
=              in the Institute resulting from postponed enrollments due to student strikes.
Cost overruns, about 4% over the appraisal estimates including contingencies,
would be covered by the government. Disbursement as of April 30, 1982 repre-
*              sented 71% of the target, but is expected to improve substantially with
increased activity in the civil works program.
Credit No. 799 Third Telecommunications Project $14.5 million Credit of
August 22, 1978; Effective Date: February 27, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1984
Procurement actions have been initiated on all items. However, a
cost overrun has been identified and alternative approaches are being
explored to resolve the shortfall. ODA is financing the telex exchange
equipment and the satellite earth station. The project is expected to be
completed about two years behind schedule.
Credit No. 812  Sunsari-Morang Irrigation and Drainage Development Project
$30 million Credit of July 7, 1978; Effective Da,te:
November 30, 1978; Closing Date; June 30, 1984
In July 1980, a landslide in the catchment area caused al major flood
in the Kosi river, causing a considerable erosion and endangering the Chatra
Main Canal. Emergency flood protection works were carried out. Investiga-
tions for the design of headreach works to improve the water supply to and
distribution within the main canal have been completed. The ICB process for
the construction of the headreach improvements and irrigation and drainage
works in about 12,000 ha is nearing completion; bids are expected to be
submitted in the second half of 1982. The project is facing a cost overrun
and project implementation has fallen about two years behind schedule.
Credit No. 856 Narayani Zone Irrigation - Stage II Project
$14.0 million Credit of November 27, 1978; Effective
Date: January 8, 1979; Closing Date: December 31, 1983
Project implementation is proceeding steadily, although slower than
anticipated. The major constraint is the weakness of local contractors.
Construction is now on-going in five of the six irrigated blocks. Procure-
ment of construction and O&M equipment is underway. The project is at least
two years behind schedule.

Credit No. 939  Second Rural Development Project - Mahakali Hills $11.0
million Credit of August 9, 1979; Effective Date:
January 15, 1980; Closing Date: February 28, 1985
Project progress since credit effectiveness has been negligible due
to:  (a) delays in setting up and staffing of project management;  (b) delays
in constructing project headquarters; (c) remoteness of the project area and
communication difficulties; (d) dislocation created by the devastating earth-
quake in the project area during June 1980; and (e) delay in the release of
budgeted funds. Recently, some civil works have started, and a considerable
amount of initial planning and design work for ma:jor construction work under
the project has been completed. Consequently, implementation is likely to
pick up pace during this calendar year.
Credit No. 1008 Community Forestry Development and Training Project $17.0
million of May 22, 1980; Effective! Date: September 19,
1980; Closing Date: June 30, 1986
The Community Forestry Development and Training Project is progress-
ing well. An effective administrative organization has been established into
which the UNDP/FAO technical assistance team has been integrated. Except
for Panchayat Protected Forest the field planting targets have been met.
Motivation and Education, and Monitoring and Evaluation programs are being
efficiently conducted. Project committees have been set-up and have begun
to function.   Shortages of staff, delays in release of funds and HMG-s
failure to pay project and training allowances are causing implementation
problems. Construction of civil works is progressing slowly. Both
in-service and professional training courses have been started by the Train-
ing Wing and Tribhuvan University.
Credit No. 1055 Mahakali Irrigation Project (Stage I); $16.0 million
Credit of September 29, 1980; Effective Date: February 27,
1981; Closing Date: December 31, 1985
The project-s start-up activities have taken longer than anticipated.
Contracts for undertaking the survey and engineering designs have been
awarded to local engineering consultants.  The designs are scheduled for                   a
completion towards the end of 1982. ICB documents for the procurement of the
project's equipment and vehicles requirements have been finalised.

1981; Closing Date; December 31, 1985
HMG has now complied with all conditions of effectiveness and the
Bank declared the Credit effective on August 27, 1981, about 9 months after
the original effectiveness date. Engineering Consultants commenced final
design of components in September 1981 and good progress is being made.
Major material supply contracts have been invited for bidding and awards have
been made.  WSSB's increasing staffing problems (including trai.ning of staff)
will be addressed in a UNDP/TA-project to commence in January ]L982. WSSB's
role in the sector and its possible transformation into a corporation needs
to be reviewed in the near future.
Credit No. 1062 Grain Storage Project; $6.2 million Credit of January 14,
1981; Effective Date:  July 31, 1981; Closing Date:
September 30, 1984

Agricultural Development Officers, Subject Matter Specialists, Junior Tech-
nicians, Junior Technical Assistants and Panchayat Level Agricultural Assis-
tants, has been completed in the first two project districts (Jhapa and
Nawalparasi) and field work has started.
Professional staff recruitment and progress of civil works is slow.
The first year-s supply of fertilizer has been received. Tenders have been
floated for the second year's supplies.
The Technical Assistance Agreement has been signed and three out of
four consultants are in position.

Credit No.1101 Hill Food Production Project; $8.0 million Credit of
April 6, 1981; Effective Date: May 28, 1981; Closing Date:
July 15, _1987
The project was activated by the appointment of the project coor-
dinator in the summer of 1981, but HMG budget was not available until Novem-
ber. Existing staff have received orientation and training in extension
methodology. Consultants for technical assistance have been appointed and
they have implemented the first phase of their program. The first shipment
of fertilizer under the project has been distributed and tenders are now out
for the second. Livestock and irrigation activities and construction of
agricultural service centers are lagging, but project is making satisfactory
progress.
