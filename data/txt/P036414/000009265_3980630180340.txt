1. SECTOR BACKGROUND:
URBAN ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
A. Environmental Issues in China
1.1         China's environmental protection system has developed along with the economic
reform and opening. Active environmental protection measures started to be instituted in the late
1970s to reverse the environmental degradation resulting from earlier industrial promotions, and
over the past 20 years, a broad set of laws and control instruments and an extensive
administrative network have been developed. China has also become an active partner in
international efforts to control pollution, becoming one of the first countries to develop their
Agenda 21 program after the Rio conference. In the meanwhile, China's industrial production
has grown explosively, more than quadrupling in the last decade and accounting for about three
quarters of total GDP growth during the period. It has brought along an accelerated growth of
urban incomes and population. China's urban population is estimated to be over 400 million now
and is projected to double within the next two decades.
1.2         Environmental pressures have increased greatly, along with, but not as fast as the
industrial growth thanks to the active environmental protection and the cleaner technologies
financed by the massive industrial investments. For example, total suspended particulate (TSP)
concentrations have been markedly reduced in many cities, discharges of toxic metals in
wastewater have fallen substantially, and pollution discharges per unit value of industrial output
have declined significantly due to reuse and other water-saving techniques. Overall, however,
these improvements could not outrun the fast growth in industrial production and municipal
wastes. Ambient concentrations of various pollutants remain at unhealthy levels in many cities.
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions have remain high due to heavy dependence on low-quality coal
burning and the increasing automobiles. Water pollution continues to grow and is among the
most serious enviromnental issues especially in the cities. At least some sections of rivers in 54
of 58 cities recently surveyed failed to meet even the lowest acceptable standard (quality Class
V), leaving few economic uses except as sewers; and the percentage of urban aquifers deemed
polluted has risen from 20 percent in 1983 to over 45 percent today. Solid waste has also grown
rapidly, and only some 25 percent of the municipal solid waste and nightsoil are disposed of to
national standards. The remainder is dumped without proper control.
1.3         The cost of this pollution is high. Epidemiological studies estimate that TSP in
urban China is responsible for over 150,000 premature deaths a year in Chinese cities, and have
shown a close relationship between outdoor sulfur dioxide concentrations and mortality. Health
costs of water pollution are more difficult to measure, but the direct economic costs alone are
substantial. Cities have been forced to move their water intakes to increasingly distant and more
expensive raw water sources, farmers have had to switch from irrigation with surface water to
pumping groundwater, many surface water bodies can no longer be used for recreation and
fisheries. The nature and consequences of the pollution have been documented in three Bank
sector studies: China: Efficiency and Environmental Impact of Coal Use (Report No. 8915-CHA,
March 1991), China: Environmental Strategy Paper (Report No. 9669-CHA, April 1992) and
China: Urban Environmental Service Management (Report No. 13073-CHA, December 1994).

B. Environmental Management System in China
1.4          China's Environmental policies, standards, monitoring and regulations are in the
purview of the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA), as the secretariat of
Environmental Protection Committees of the National People's Congress and the State Council.
The Ministry of Construction (MOC) has similar responsibilities for public facilities for water
supply and wastewater and solid waste management, and Ministry of Water Resources for natural
water bodies. Industry ministries also maintain environmental units which, in cooperation with
the NEPA system, establish sector-specific pollution control strategies and technologies. But
these ministries do not have implementation authority, which is held by their corresponding
administrative units of local governments.
1.5          Though constitutionally a unitary state, China has a strongly decentralized system
of governance. The Government of China (GOC) sets broad policies and standards but lets local
governments to implement the policies and set detailed regulations unless preempted by national
ones. Often GOC encourages local governments to experiment with various standards and ways
to achieve basic objectives with a view to establish national best practices and norms based on
local experiences. This decentralized governance is reinforced by the decentralized public
finance system, where local governments collect most of the public revenues, remit a major part
of the value added tax, but allocate the major part of revenues on their own. Local governments
also tend to be well-staffed, as their broad authority over the local economy makes them
attractive employers. The main level of autonomous governance is the municipality which often
oversees affairs of surrounding rural counties. Some municipalities report directly to GOC. In
rural areas, Prefectures manage a group of county governments under substantially stronger
supervision of the provincial government.
1.6          NEPA oversees the work of its local counterpart, Environmental Protection
Bureaus (EPB) at different levels of government. Provincial EPBs have the authority to set local
environmental standards in the absence of preemptive national standards, or to impose more
stringent standards than those required by the national government, approve plans of lower-level
EPBs, and may play a direct role in implementation. However, the municipal, urban district and
county EPBs bear the main burden of enforcement for both national and provincial regulations.
The budgets, personnel appointments, and work plans of each level EPB derive from the
government of that level. To aid quality control, environmental performance must be reported to
the next higher level EPB, which also sets testing protocols and other performance criteria.
1.7          Chinese environmental regulation focuses on three instruments: environmental
assessment before approval of new investment projects; the "Three Simultaneous" licensing
strategy that requires integration of pollution control in project design, inclusion of the abatement
measures in the investment, and proper operation of the abatement equipment; and a pollution
levies charged against waste discharges that have concentrations of pollutants above permitted
levels. More recently, governments have been authorized to levy a small fee on wastewater
discharges within standards. The pollution levies finance operation of the environmental
protection system. Local EPBs retain a part of the revenue to cover their own operating costs,
and provide the remaining funds to finance eligible pollution abatement investments by
enterprises, now mainly in the form of concessional loans. NEPA recognizes problems with the
pollution levy system, including: the level of charges considerably below the marginal cost of
effluent treatment, which encourages enterprises to pay the fee rather than operate or invest in



3
treatment facilities or cleaner production technologies; and charging fees on the basis of
concentration of individual discharges rather than an area-wide basis.
1.8           More serious are the constraints to regulatory enforcement and levy collection due
to conflicts inherent in China's economic transition and the governance structure. Local
governments have strong vested interest in preserving employment and competitiveness of
enterprises in their localities, but also the responsibility for environmental regulation and assess
pollution levies, which often hurt the short-term economic interests. Balancing of these interests
result in great variances in regulatory enforcement and levy revenues across localities. In general
the larger and wealthier of Chinese cities tend to have better records in these regards, reflecting
their constituents' reaction to heavy environmental costs of earlier industrial development and
higher demand for cleaner environment. On the other hand, pollution by enterprises operating on
the periphery of cities, mainly the township and village enterprises (TVEs), tend to be subject to
much less control than the neighboring municipalities. As a group their growth has been
extremely fast, presenting a major task for industrial pollution control for the nation as a whole.
NEPA has an active program of research and experimentation underway to identify new
approaches to overcome these and other regulatory problems, moving toward instruments based
on catchments and market mechanisms.
1.9           Urban environmental services, which include collection and treatment of waste
water and solid waste, fall under the purview of the Construction Commissions of localities,
under the regulatory guidance and standards established by the Ministry of Construction. As
discussed above, local governments have the resources and autonomy to set their own priorities
and implement them. The Construction Commissions are typically among the most powerful and
best funded of the municipal administrative bodies, having under them bureaus or companies
directly providing key urban services. Until recently, they have focused their resources mainly
to water supply, roads, and economic investment over environmental services. Satisfactory
attainment in these areas as well as rapidly growing problems with waste water and solid waste
have led to re-evaluation of the priorities, and many cities have started investing considerable
resources to deal with the latter. However, wastewater treatment levels are very low, with only
4.5 percent of municipal flows treated in 1992. The Ministry of Construction estimates, further,
that two thirds of the municipal sewage treatment plants either do not operate, or operate far
below capacity, due mainly to lack of funds.
1.10          Developing a secure funding system is a critical step for provision of
environmental services. The established practice of charging for water supply and fiscal charges
earmarked for roads have been important ingredients in the achievements in those areas. A
sector study, China: Urban Environmental Service Management, identified the failure to charge
adequately for environmental services as a major policy issue. Users have traditionally paid for
solid waste and nightsoil, although the revenues often fall short of the increasing cost of
collection and treatment. For sewerage, user charges have been introduced only recently, and
their levels and scope are usually far below operating needs, not to mention capital costs which
often have been financed with the general revenues. However, as the general public finance
revenues are likely to remain constrained, it would be essential that users pay a much larger
share of the cost if not full. User fees would also provide incentives for savings of water use and
discharges, but the institutional separation of water supply and sewerage in Chinese cities
presents difficulties in financial and economic management of these essentially linked services.



4
1.11         Another major related issue is the appropriateness of standards of infrastructure
and environmental services and facilities. Most municipalities of China apply a narrow set of
design norms prescribed by MOC in building public infrastructure facilities and in allowing
developers to build new properties or "modernize" existing areas through redevelopment. As
these standards tend to be high relative to long-term affordability and investments often have the
first call on available resources, the results are limited scope of services, suboptimal performance
due to the lack of complementary facilities and operation and maintenance (O&M). These
problems are most pronounced in newer types of services such as sewerage. In general,
however, facilities planning needs to focus mainly on performance rather than physical norms.
C. Bank Group Strategies and Experiences
1.12         The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for China discussed at the Bank Group
Board in February 1997 identifies four areas for the Bank Group to focus on: macroeconomic
and structural reforms, removal of infrastructure bottlenecks, human development including
poverty alleviation and health, and environmental protection. Urban environmental issues are
recognized as important challenges relevant to the latter three focus areas. The Bank Group has
supported urban environmental improvement in over twenty Chinese cities through ten projects.
These projects and the sector work have focused mainly on waste water management, identified
as a main issue by the Environmental Strategy Paper, but also provided considerable support for
solid waste management and industrial pollution control. These operations have demonstrated the
value of the Bank's project analysis in planning complex environmental programs, particularly at
the time systems of urban environmental management are being newly defined in China.
Combined with strong implementation capacity of the borrowers, they yielded fast and substantial
benefits on the ground.
1.13         Most of the earlier projects have directed the Bank Group assistance in large cities
of the northeastern and eastern coastal provinces, in view of the environmental and developmental
needs of the established industrial centers, and also their demonstration effects. Environmental
pressures remain high in those areas and cooperation will continue. However, the Bank has
started shifting its attention toward inland and poorer areas with two recent environmental
projects in Hubei (1995) and Yunnan (1996). Further, these project and a few other projects
recently appraised or under preparation have also started involving small urban areas, in another
shift from the focus on large cities. This shift of geographical focus is likely to call for stronger
attention to appropriate standards and equity implications of the urban environmental services.
1.14         The review of Bank Group experience worldwide in urban services improvement
emphasize the need for strong institutions and finances in order to sustain the benefits of
intervention by enabling adequate operation, maintenance and continued investments. The urban
environmental projects and sector work in China have also focused on adequate pricing of
sewerage services and establishment of autonomous sewerage companies, and have attained
considerable successes, which are having considerable demonstration effects to the rest of China.
The Bank Group's worldwide experience in this and related sectors also has shown the
importance of appropriate standards and strategic framework in choice and design of investments,
and the value of broad river basin-wide approaches in managing water resources and waste water.
Urban environmental projects in China have drawn upon urban comprehensive environmental
plans or provided support for their preparation, often incorporating issues of the river basins.
However, integrated river basin management has not featured in these projects partly due to the



5
projects' focus on few municipalities and due to institutional complexities. Integrated
management is being introduced under a few recent water resource projects in China.
1.15         Most of the urban environmental projects in China have also supported revolving
funds for industrial pollution. A recent review of Bank experience (Industry and Environment:
Patterns in World Bank Lending) emphasizes the need for political commitment, clear standards
and regulations, incentives to comply, and institutional capability to monitor and enforce
standards. When industrial pollution abatement subloans are involved, the following conditions
increase likelihood of success: a profitable and growing industrial sector, flexibility in choice of
technology, availability of funds at close-to-market terms, and targeting on sources that can yield
significant improvement in the ambient environment. In China, the Bank Group is supporting an
Environmental Technical Assistance Project (1992) to assist NEPA in its efforts to find more
efficient regulatory methods, improve staff capabilities, and bolster environmental monitoring.

2. DEVELOPMENT AND ENVIRONMENT OF GUANGXI:
STATUS AND ISSUES
A. Economic and Urban Development
2.1          Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region is one of the poorest areas in China. Of its
total population of about 45 million, close to half consists of Zhuang and other ethnic minorities,
and some 8 million residents are officially classified as the poor (earning less than Yuan 500 a
year per capita). Its poverty has long been attributed to the picturesque but infertile karst
(limestone formation) hills that predominate the northern part of the Region, low levels of
education and infrastructure. Another important factor appears to have been the restrictions
imposed on it as the frontier in the conflict with Viet Nam, which prevented the Region from
taking part in China's economic opening. The Region is otherwise strategically located on the
coast between Guangdong and Viet Nam. Beside the strategic location, the Region's other
economic assets include abundant water resources, semi-tropical climate favorable for farming, a
fair amount of farmland and mineral resources.
2.2          Since the "opening" of the Region in 1990, its economy has grown at rates
consistently and significantly above the national average (see Table 1). As a result, its per capita
income, the lowest among thirty province-level subdivisions of China as late as 1989, surpassed
ten others' by 1994. The Region's economic growth has been led by the industrial sector,
particularly in food processing, building materials, and transportation equipment manufacturing.
On-going heavy investments in power and transportation
infrastructure lay the basis for economic development taking
Table 2.1            advantage of the Region's endowments, while adding a
Guangxi's Economic Growth   significant component of the recent growth.
1990 1995 Growth    2.3          Along with the growth of industries and the
%/yr     income gap between urban and rural areas, urban population
GDP per capita                growth has accelerated to well above 5 % a year, and rural
(Yuan, 1995 prices)           population has started declining in absolute number. While
All China 2910 4835  10%    the speed of industrialization and urbanization is high, it is
Guangxi  1662 3535  16%      important to note, their levels are still relatively low. More
Guangxi GDP by Sector         than half of the Region's population lives within boundaries
of cities and towns, but the majority of them are still
Primary   45%  26%  6%      classified as agricultural. Only three cities have urban
Secondary  30%  44% 25%     populations over half a million: Nanning, the capital, with
about a million urban residents in 1995; Liuzhou, the
industrial center, with 900,000; and Guilin, the tourism center, with 500,000. Their average
annual per capita income was slightly above Y 5000, compared with about Y 1,100 for rural
residents.

B. Environmental Issues
2.4          Similarly, compared with older industrial areas of China, Guangxi's environmental
problems are smaller in magnitude or intensity overall, but are growing much faster. Serious
problems that do exist tend to be localized and unique. At the same time, the levels of
environmental services and protection are also lower, due to weak financial and technical
capacity. Unless upgraded quickly, the environmental management capacity is likely to be
overwhelmed by growing environmental pressures in the near future.
2.5         Industrial pollution provides a case in point. In most parts of China, industrial
pollution discharge per output declined in the recent past thanks to newer and cleaner plants,
more waste treatment, and stronger regulation. In Guangxi, however, industrial pollution per
output value has changed little and is now the highest in the country. This may be explained by
the level and structure of the industrial development. Structurally, the most important industrial
sector in Guangxi in terms of composition and growth is food processing that generate heavy
pollution load per output. Of particular economic and environmental importance are sugar
refineries which produce a tenth of the Region's industrial output, a quarter of total industrial
wastewater and 75 % of industrial wastewater pollution load. On the other hand, at the current
level of production, the aggregate pollution load is still relatively low and has not been given as
much policy attention as the expansion of production. For example, the Region's Environmental
Protection Bureau (EPB) was given status equivalent to EPBs of most other provinces only in
1995, and the capacity for environmental monitoring, regulatory enforcement, technical support
appears to be weak.
2.6          Though the aggregate pollution load is still moderate, fast growing cities and
towns are beginning to experience problems similar to or worse than those in China's older
industrial centers. The worst example is Liuzhou, the Region's industrial center with a GIOV of
around RMB 17 billion, some four times higher than that of Nanning. The city's heavy
industrial output, which more than doubled in three years between 1990 and 1993, exacerbated
the already severe industrial pollution, especially air quality. For example, the frequency of acid
rain is about 95 % and acidity often approaches pH value of 3. The air quality standard for S02
is exceeded for almost 60 % of the time compared to only around 2 % for Nanning and Guilin.
A major program to reduce air and water pollution in Liuzhou started in 1996, with a bilateral
financing of $100 million. Extending the environmental improvement program of the Region, the
Government requested a Bank Group support for environmental improvement mainly in the two
other major cities of the Region, Nanning and Guilin.
C. Nanning and Guilin
2.7          Nanning, the Regional capital and the largest city, is growing fast on the strength
of upgraded regional rail and highway networks and external investments. The city's major
economic base consists of small and medium-size industries, but the service sector is growing the
mostly rapidly, by over 20% a year. The city's air pollution has stabilized and is modest
compared with other Chinese cities, and an adequate solid waste management system has been
built recently. On the other hand, the city lacks modern sewerage system, relying on a small and
poorly maintained network of combined sewers and septic tanks. Improved control and
pretreatment of industrial wastewater have slowed its growth, but its volume and pollution load
remain significant and domestic sewage is increasing rapidly. As a result, main urban streams



8
act as virtual sewers and their quality continues to deteriorate. Pollution of Yongjiang (Yong
River), into which the urban streams discharge, increases markedly as the river flows through the
city, turning from moderate to significant degrees (Chinese water quality Class III to Class IV).
2.8          The water pollution has become a serious issue not only for the environment itself
but also for social and economic development. A city water intake located on the River in the
middle reach of Yongjiang cannot operate to capacity due to pollution from time to time, and
would have to be shut down completely if the pollution continues to increase. The pollution of
urban streams, particularly the visible pollution of the Chaoyang Stream and Nanhu Lake in the
commercial and residential center of the city, presents serious problems for public health and for
development of the area as commercial centers. The Nanning Municipality (NM) therefore has
decided to implement a major program to improve the wastewater management system. It has
secured a bilateral funding for a sewage treatment plant (STP) of 160 ML/day capacity, but a
much larger investment is required for building the sewer networks and at least one more STP.
2.9          While newly built urban areas have secondary and tertiary sewers, there are many
neighborhoods in both Nanning and Guilin that do not. Many that lack sewerage also tend to
lack adequate drainage, footpaths, garbage collection points, public toilets, housing, etc. - in
short poor physical environment. Generally in cities of China poor quality of housing and
neighborhood environment is the major element and the best indicator of poverty. While many
poor areas are being redeveloped, wholesale new developments are unlikely to meet the fast
increasing need for improved services in the near future, particularly as the cities grow mainly by
incorporating semi-rural fringes and low-income inunigrants from rural areas. In Nanning and
Guilin, immigrant population without permanent urban registration has surged in the last five
years and is estimated to account for over 25% of the urban population. Reflecting the Region's
strong emphasis on poverty alleviation, municipal governments in Guangxi, unlike their
counterpart elsewhere, have been accommodating or at least tolerant of the temporary residents,
and have provided some basic urban services including garbage collection and schooling to large
informal settlements. In Nanning there is a large squatter settlement, but in general, most of the
poor live scattered throughout the city's residential areas with inadequate facilities.
2.10         In Guilin, the main concern has always been the quality of the Lijiang (Li River),
a top scenic treasure of China and the city's economic lifeline. Some 20% of the city's GDP is
estimated to originate from tourism. Due to the importance of the River to the country and the
city, Guilin Municipality (GM) has one of the earliest and best urban environmental management
system in China, though there still exists considerable gaps to fill. GM has successfully carried
out industrial pollution controls, forcing and helping heavy industrial polluters to reduce their
discharges, relocate, or close. It has been operating an effective solid waste management
including a landfill, an extensive separate sewer network covering over 70% of the developed
urban core, and three secondary STPs. As a result, the Lijiang water is maintained at a good
quality (Class II) most of the time. The major remaining tasks include: developing a new landfill
to replace the one that is filling up; extending the sewer network to cover the unserved areas; and
expanding one of the existing STPs; and cleaning up some urban waterways. These would
substantially improve Lijiang tributaries flowing through the city. It is also necessary to provide
sewerage systems in outlying suburbs, partly to deal with discharges of industries relocating from
the city.



9
2.11        Quantity of water in the Lijiang is another significant issue. The flow of water
during the dry season, between October and April, the water flow in the River is so low to
seriously constrain normal plying of scenic cruises, assimilation of wastewater discharges, and
water supply to the city. During the rainy season, the city and rural areas along the River are
subjected to substantial flood damages. To better regulate the Lijiang flow, GM and the Guangxi
Region have been preparing a comprehensive set of water works programs. A part of the
proposed programs completed so far, a large reservoir and considerable embankments, falls far
short of effective regulation of the flows. Along with physical reasons, the fluctuation of the
Lijiang flow appears to be due partly to the increase water use by the increased population and
economic activities in the valley. Although considerable water conservation activities have been
undertaken, the existence of three different jurisdictions impedes effective water resource
management, indicating a need for a more integrated institutional framework.
D. Bank Group Involvement in Guangxi
2.12         Guangxi has been one of the beneficiaries in a number of projected supported by
the Bank Group: the Yangtan Hydroelectric Project (1986), National Health Project (1991*),
Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Project (1993), National Environmental Technical Assistance
Project (1992), Inland Waterways Project (1995), and Southwest Poverty Reduction Project
(1995). The proposed Guangxi Urban Environment Project would be the first Bank project in
which Guangxi would be the sole beneficiary. GOC also proposed for the Bank financing a
Baise Multipurpose Dam project, which would be located in Guangxi and would regulate the flow
variation of Yongjiang (also known as Youjiang) which flows through Nanning.
2.13        The proposed project would address two of the four CAS focuses: environmental
protection and human development that includes poverty alleviation and health. Guangxi's urban
environmental issues are broadly similar to the pattern seen throughout China, and the project
would help address them with an array of instruments similar to those adopted in the Bank
Group's other urban environmental projects. The Bank Group's assistance in evaluating and
planning complex investments, that has added significant value to other similar projects, has
proven even more significant in preparation of the proposed project. Nanning and Guilin,
medium-sized and medium-income with a substantial tertiary sector, represent a class of cities
different from hosts of earlier urban projects supported by the Bank Group, that were either very
large or predominantly industrial.
2.14        The project would contribute to poverty alleviation by helping a poor western
region, being the second environmental project in such a region after the Yunnan Environment
Project (FY96), and targeting the urban poor for the first time. Nanning and Guilin have a large
presence of temporary population and neighborhoods with poor environmental quality, whose
conditions are unlikely to be improved soon through traditional development schemes, and
accommodating government policy toward them. The Southwest Poverty Reduction Project is
supporting housing development in Nanning mainly to help accommodate the migrant population.
The Bank Group has supported many housing and area upgrading operations in most parts of the
world, but not in China. Simple investments focusing on basic needs and strong beneficiary
participation have proven highly cost-effective in other countries. The proposed project would
pilot such an approach for application in urban China.

3. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A. Project Objectives
3.1         The project would help improve the environment of Nanning and Guilin, in
support of sustainable economic growth and poverty alleviation in the Region. Specific
objectives of the project are:
(a)   To improve the quality of major water bodies -- in particular Chaoyang stream
and Yongjiang in Nanning and Lijiang and its tributaries in Guilin;
(b)   To regulate the flow of the Lijiang;

environmental deficiencies, mainly to improve quality of surface and ground water; regulatory
actions to reduce industrial pollution; and measures to strengthen technical and financial capacity
of environmental protection, waste water management, and water resource management
institutions. The components are outlined below, described in more detail in Annexes 1 through
6, and their implementation and financial arrangements are discussed in Chapter 4 and 5:
(a)   Sewerage and Drainage in Nanning: cleaning up the Chaoyang stream and
building interceptors; building and improving main and secondary sewers and
drains of about 70 km total length; building associated pumping stations; building
a primary sewage treatment plant (STP) to treat sewage collected by the new
sewers, with an estimated capacity of about 180 ML/day; improving equipment
and information systems for nightsoil management; carrying out an action plan of
regulatory enforcement for industries to comply with surface water discharge
standards (total cost $80 million).
(b)   Sewerage and Solid Waste Management in Guiin: building about 30 km of
primary and secondary sewers in built up areas of the city and Xicheng, an
industrial suburb; building pumping stations to convey the sewage to existing
STPs; expanding an existing secondary STP by 25 ML/day; building a primary
STP of up to 40 ML/day capacity in Xicheng, and oxidation ponds in suburban
towns of Yangshuo, Xingping and Baisha; cleaning up and intercepting sewage
from three lakes in the city; building a sanitary solid waste landfill of 500 ton/day

capacity and a transfer station; and augmenting the fleet of solid waste trucks;
carrying out an action plan to reduce industrial pollution in the city (total cost $46
million).
(c)    Small Area Improvement: building or improving tertiary sewers, drains, solid
waste dumps, public toilets, and footpaths in up to 30 selected small areas with
poor environmental quality in Nanning and Guilin. Residents will play the major
role in selecting, implementing, and financing the improvements (total cost about
$ 9.2 million).
(d)   Lijiang Flow Regulation: lining and extending a 26 km canal conveying water
from an existing Wulixia Reservoir to the Lijiang, installing a hydro-power
generator of 0.8 MW capacity; plantation on about 2000 ha in the reservoir
catchment and along the Lijiang; and building or repairing about 28 km sections
of embankment along the Lijiang (total cost $22 million).
(e)   Sugar Refinery Pollution Abatement: a subloan facility ($2 million) to finance
installations by financially sound refineries to minimize and treat highly polluting
stillage from sugar-based alcohol production processes.
(f)   Institutional Development: technical assistance, training, and equipment to
improve environmental monitoring and enforcement by EPBs of the Region, NM,
GM, and GP; develop technical, financial, and management capabilities of
sewerage and drainage management institutions in Nanning and Guilin; help
develop an institution and techniques for managing the use and protection of the
Lijiang; and help the implementing agencies carry out the project efficiently (total
cost about $ 6.9 million).
C. Major Targets and Monitoring Indicators
3.3          Project components described in para 3.2 above aim at specific project objectives
listed in para 3.1: components 3.2 (a), (b) and (e) to achieve the primary project objective, 3.1
(a); components 3.2 (c) for objective (c); and components (f) for objective (b). Major targets and
monitoring indicators for the components are described below. The progress and success of the
project and individual components will be evaluated against these and secondary monitoring
indicators, listed in Annex 10.
(a)    Sewerage and Drainage in Nanning: Quality of water in Chaoyang stream,
currently polluted over 10 times the Class V limit, to be improved to Class V by
year 2002; water quality of Yongjiang mid-point between the city boundaries, now
between Classes III and IV, improved to Class III from 2002.
(b)   Sewerage and Solid Waste Management in Guilin: The percentage of pollution
in Lijiang measured at various locations and times exceeding Class II standards to
be reduced to near zero by year 2003; water quality of Taohuajiang, a Lijiang
tributary flowing through Guilin city, improved from Class IV-V to Class III-IV.



12
(c)    Small Area Improvement: the number of beneficiaries, especially those with
incomes below urban average (about 100,000 and 70,000, respectively, over the
project period).
(d)   Lijiang Flow Regulation: Average dry season water flow of Lijiang at the
northern border of GM, now about 30 m3 per second, to be increased to at least
35 m3/sec by 2003.
(e)    Sugar Refinery Pollution Abatement: Total amount of annual COD reduction,
about 10,000 tons over the project period.
(f)   Institutional Development: Increased frequency and coverage of compliance
monitoring by EPBs; increased scope of autonomous operations by the sewerage
companies and the Lijiang commission, measured by percentage of operating and
capital expenditures independently financed and managed; and total and unit (per
sewage volume) expenditures for operating and maintaining the sewerage systems.
D. Project Cost and Financing
3.4          Estimated costs are summarized by group of components and by jurisdiction in
Table 3.2; Annex 11 shows detailed cost estimates by component and type of input. The project
will cost about $175 million in total in current prices, including $6.5 million in interest during
construction. The Bank Group loan and credit will finance about 52.5% of the cost, in total as
well as in each of the jurisdictions. Local governments will be responsible for most of the
counterpart financing and repayment of the loan and credit. For small area upgrading, the area
residents will contribute on average about 40% of the cost, and for the sugar refinery pollution
abatement subprojects the beneficiary refineries would finance an average of 60% of cost and pay
back the subloans. The financing arrangements, summarized in Table 3. 1, are discussed in more
detail in Chapter 4.

E. Project Preparation Status
3.5          The project, initially proposed for Bank Group financing in 1994 and identified in
October 1995, underwent a major strategic and technical reformulation during preparation based
on economic and technical evaluation discussed in Chapter 6. Most of the feasibility studies and
design work for urban sanitation components have been carried out by design institutes recruited
from outside the Region. They have been assisted by an Australian consultant team financed by
a grant from the Australian Agency for International Development. Feasibility studies and design
of Lijiang flow regulation components have been carried out by the Regional Design Institute
with the help of a Canadian consultant mobilized by the Canada International Development
Agency, Inc. (CIDA, Inc.) This team has also carried out studies for environmental master plans
of Nanning and Guilin cities.
3.6          Detailed or preliminary design is complete or near completion for most of the
physical construction components, and bidding documents have been drafted for four major
components. Major exceptions include the following:
(a)   Small area improvement program: draft designs have been prepared through
community consultations for two of the small areas selected to be improved first.
Four to six areas will be selected for detailed preparation and implementation of
improvements each year. Annual programs, criteria and procedures for selection
and implementation of the subprojects have been agreed upon. They would be
subject to further modification on the basis of implementation experience and in
consultation between the municipalities and the Bank Group.
(b)   Optimal capacities of the Jiangnan STP in Nanning, established by the feasibility
review in the range of 150 ML - 250 ML a day, would be finalized during the
design phase during 1999-2000 on the basis of updated projection of sewage
flows. Similarly, the capacity of the proposed Xicheng STP, now estimated to be
about 25 ML/day, would be finalized during the design that would be carried out
in 1999-2000.

4. Beneficiaries and Finances
A. Local Governments
4.1           The project involves four local jurisdictions: Guangxi Autonomous Region (GAR),
Nanning Municipality (NM), Guilin Municipality (GM), and Guilin Prefecture (GP). The latter
three are formally subordinate to GAR, but have a large degree of autonomy in financing and
managing most governmental functions within their jurisdictions. Guilin Municipality and
Prefecture are two independent neighboring jurisdictions of the same level, with both government
headquarters seated in Guilin city. GM includes two semi-autonomous suburban counties of
Yanshuo and Lingui which will be primarily responsible for several small sewerage works and
small area improvement schemes. Administrative units under these jurisdictions are responsible
for implementing all of the project components, as listed in Table 5.1 in the next Chapter.
4.2           Local government finances in China are subject to considerable ambiguities and
uncertainties, due to unclear boundaries of public finance and due to significant on-going
transition in the revenue system. Revenues and expenditures over which local governments have
varying degrees of control are accounted for under three different categories: "normal" budget,
"extra-budgetary" accounts, and "off-budget" accounts. The first two categories include revenues
from statutory taxes and levies, and their allocations are subject to approval by higher levels of
government. Expenditures are usually a better gauge of resources available as some of the
revenues are shared among levels of government. Net transfers are positive for GAR and GP,
negative for NM and GM. The third, off-budgetary resources consist of non-tax revenues such
as net income remitted from municipally controlled enterprises, including public utilities, and
user charges collected by administrative departments. Their allocation is subject to little control
by higher levels of government.

* Note: 1994 figures
4.3          Most categories of revenues and expenditures in the three local jurisdictions under
GAR have shown increases in real terms between 1991 and 1995. In general, however,



16
revenues net of transfers suffered a decline in real terms since the 1994 tax reform although it is
reported that they started to increase above inflation recently. Further, off-budget revenues of
GM declined in absolute terms in 1993, when major tourism enterprises, which belonged to GM
and contributed the largest part of off-budget resources of GM until then, were taken over by the
central government and hence their incomes excluded from the GM's direct control. These
enterprises, however, still make some contribution to investment in tourism-related infrastructure.
Even without this, GM enjoys a high fiscal resources per capita, compared with Nanning with
twice the population. Table 4.1 shows the expenditures of the local governments in 1991 and
1995, as well as an estimate of investments in urban and environmental infrastructure in 1995.
4.4          Table 3.2 lists the estimated counterpart financing requirements on the part of
local governments, net of financing by beneficiaries of sugar pollution control and small area
improvement components. The estimated GAR counterpart fiancing includes a contribution of
Y 90 million to subsidize the Nanning sewerage investments. The last line in Table 4.1 lists
estimated peak annual counterpart financing burden on local governments (defined as 30% of
local financing needs that are not met by users and beneficiaries) converted to 1995 prices for
easier comparison with the 1995 total expenditures and infrastructure investments by local
government. The comparisons indicate that these are significant but easily affordable share of
normal infrastructure investments in each locality, even without any real term increases in their
general revenues and expenditures.
B. Sewerage Finances and Organizations
4.5          In Nanning and Guilin, environmental services of drainage, sewerage, solid waste
and nightsoil are managed by municipal government bureaus while water supply is managed by
municipally owned companies. Most of these traditional environmental services are financially
self-sufficient or incur negligible deficits at present. A major emerging issue is the financing and
management of sewerage services, which are relatively new and expensive. (Refer to Annex 3
for current and future water and sewerage charges in the two cities.) Current status and plans to
develop financial and institutional capacities to ensure adequate and sustainable sewerage services
are discussed below. Although existing conditions differ significantly between Nanning and
Guilin, plans for wastewater management in both cities call for institutional autonomy and
accountability, and the recurrent financial base relying mainly on charges according to the
"polluter pays" principle of China's environmental protection system.
Nanning
4.6          Currently Nanning has little sewerage system, mixed in with the storm water
drainage managed by the Municipal Drainage Division. The system is expanding rapidly,
however, as a part of an on-going new development in the Landong area and the planned
upgrading of existing urban areas particularly around Chaoyangxi. These major undertakings are
planned and managed by special-purpose agencies, Landong Area Development Office and
Chaoyangxi Improvement Office, reporting directly to the mayor. Most of the sewerage and
drainage construction financed under the project would be managed by the latter. Effective
operation of the sewerage facilities would require a permanent institution with a far greater
technical capacity than currently exists in the city and an adequate and sustainable financial base.



17
4.7          NM has started implementing an institutional development program (refer to
Annex 3), which has been reviewed by the Bank Group. During the pre-operational phase in
1998 and 1999, basic systems and procedures for technical and financial management would be
designed, and staff would be recruited and trained. Also, a framework of a permanent institution
would be designed, specifying its mandates, reveneue base, and organizational structure. The
current plan envisages incorporating an autonomous sewerage company in 1999. The company
will take over all drainage and sewerage facilities, as they are completed, for operation on the
basis of agreements or contracts clearly defining performance targets and other responsibilities on
the one hand and associated financial bases and other resources and authorities on the other. The
institutional development program would continue to evolve, defining details for later stages of
systems development and training activities that would continue after the establishment of the
company. An action plan defining the charter and structure of a sewerage company and plans for
its continued development is expected to be completed by the middle of 1999. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that NM would implement an institutional development program,
satisfactory to the Bank Group and revised from time to time, to develop an effective sewerage
management institution, including a program of technical assistance and training with assistance
of competent consultants which shall start by the end of 1998.
4.8          Current expenditures for sewerage and drainage operations in Nanning, less than
Y 5 million a year, are financed with budgetary allocations from the urban maintenance and
construction tax (UMCT) revenues. A major part of the new investments are financed through
the lease of improved land, the UMCT, GAR subsidy, and loans including $5 million bilaterial
loan for the Landong STP and the Bank Group loan for the project. However, broader and more
sustainable financing of investments and particularly the future operations would require recurrent
charges. NM introduced a sewerage charge for non-residential users in 1996 and recently
increased it to Y 0.18 per in3 of water use. At the same time, NM also introduced the charge on
residential users, among the first in China, at Y 0.13/m3. These steps fulfill the commitment
made during appraisal as a condition of disbursement.
4.9          Most of the revenues from these charges, expected to be over Y 30 million a year,
would be allocated by NM to on-going investments for now. Once the sewerage company starts
to take over facilities for operation, commensurate portions of the revenue base would be
assigned to the company to allow adequate operation and associated debt service. The revenues
would include, in addition to the sewerage charge collections, payment by NM for operation of
drainage facilities. It is projected that sewerage charges about twice the current level would be
required to finance full operation and debt service, starting from about 2003. (Refer to Annex 3
for financial projections). Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GAR will cause the
sewerage charges and drainage payments in Nanning to be adjusted from time to time to generate
sufficient revenues to meet expenditures necessary for adequate operation, maintenance and debt
service for sewerage and drainage facilities.
Guilin
4.10         GM has built up a relatively extensive sewerage system over the last two decades
and plans a continued expansion, in view of the importance of tourism to the city. Sewerage
operations and maintenance are currently managed by the Drainage Division of GM, which has
developed a substantial staff and technical capacity. GM has decided to transfer its functions and
staff to a Guilin Sewerage Company (GSC) to be established in 1998 in order to enable



18
clearer accounting of performance and long-run costs, and more flexible deployment of
staff and financial resources. The Company would be wholly owned by GM and governed
by a board of directors appointed by GM. Still, it would be essential that clear performance
contract is established as mentioned in paragraph 4.7 above. Planning and construction of
major facilities, including those under the project, will remain for the time being the
responsibility of the Municipal Construction Bureau. Upon completion, the facilities will
be turned over to the Company for operation. The Company would also be responsible for
operation of the sewerage facilities in Xicheng District in Lingui County, which is under
GM, to be built under the project by the Xicheng District Management Office.
4.11        Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GM will carry out an
institutional development program satisfactory to the Bank Group, including starting a
program of technical assistance and training with assistance of competent consultants, and
incorporation of an autonomous Sewerage Company with charter and revenue base
satisfactory to the Bank Group by the end of 1998. The institutional development program,
reviewed by the Bank Group, emphasizes the development of an accounting and financial
management system required for autonomous operation rather than the current dependence
on municipal allocations. The technical assistance and training programs, particularly the
consultant services, will be coordinated with those of Nanning.
4.12        An adequate financial base is the key to the sustainable sewerage operations
and to the autonomy and accountability of GSC. In the past the construction and operation
of sewerage facilities were financed by budgetary allocations of municipal revenues and
tourim development funds and considerable subsidies by the national and regional
governments. Subsidies, however, have become scarce and GM has started to borrow for
sewerage investments to supplement its own resources, adding recurrent expenditure
requirements for debt service. Operating expenditures, already substantial Y 10 million in
1996, are expected to more than double in five years not only due to the new facilities to
be built but also increased utilization of existing facilities.
4.13        Recognizing these needs, GM in 1996 increased the sewerage tariff to non-
residential users by about 100% to Y 0.1 per m3 of water use. In December 1997, the
residential tariff was increased similarly to Y 0.1/m3 and non-residential tariff was increased
further to Y 0.15/m3. Revenues from these higher tariffs are projected to fall short of
operating expenses starting from the middle of 1999. By the time investment works under
the project are completed, adequate operations and maintenance of the entire sewerage
system plus servicing of loans taken under the project are likely to require sewerage tariffs
about three times the current levels. In Xicheng, a newly developing industrial suburb of
Guilin, the sewerage system to be built under the project is expected to require considerably
higher charges, about Y 0.37/r3 in today's prices, as it would have a high unit cost due to
the relatively small size of the system and it lacks a base of paid-up assets.
4.14        Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GAR will cause the
sewerage charges in Guilin to be adjusted from time to time to generate sufficient revenues,
combined with payments for drainage services, to cover adequate operation and
maintenance of the sewerage and drainage facilities as well as debt service obligations



19
incurred from July 1, 1998. As a first step, agreement was reached during negotiations
that, as a condition of disbursement of the Bank Group loan and credit for Guilin's
sewerage works, the sewerage charges would be raised to not less than Y 0.18 per cubic
meter of water use averaged over all water use; and that construction of a sewage
treatment plant in Xicheng would not proceed before January 1, 2000 or before steps are
taken to collect charges sufficient to cover operation, maintenance, and debt service for it
after it is completed
C. Small Area Improvement
4.15        The project will pilot a participatory and low-cost approach to urban
neighborhood upgrading, which is necessary but little practised in Chinese cities. Extensive
new developments and wholesale redevelopment of existing built-up areas have transformed
most Chinese cities over the last two decades and would remain the main means for urban
development in the foresseable future. However, relying solely on these expensive methods
would leave a large part of the rapidly growing needs for urban infrastructure improvement
unmet, especially for the poor. Under many circumstances upgrading the existing physical
assets is an efficient means to improve the living environment, for the rich as well as poor,
but often the only means for the poor.
4.16        Quality of housing and physical environment is the major element and the
best indicator of real income for most urban population in China. Salaries vary little among
urban residents, but are supplemented with widely varying levels of in-kind benefits whose
main component is housing provided at nominal rents. For example, senior staff of a
prosperous work unit would live in modern apartments with implicit rental value almost
equal to cash salary, while others would have to find housing with poor facilities, either
rented on their own at high market rents or given by employers or owner-occupied.
Migrants from rural areas comprise the poorest group in urban China. They represent about
20% of Nanning and Guilin populations and their number is growing fast. Such areas are
found in former rural villages in the newly incorporated urban peripheries, old
neighborhoods in partly redeveloped urban centers, and a few shanty towns in Nanning,
although those are rare in cities of China.
4.17        The project would support low-cost improvement of neighborhood facilities
such as drainage, sewerage, latrines, access roads, and garbage collection in selected
Nanning and Guilin neighborhoods. The main selection criteria would be visible defects in
these facilities, little prospect of redevelopment in the near future, and the residents'
commitment. Fourteen such areas in Nanning and Guilin have been identified during
project preparation (two are described in Annex 7); additional areas would be identified
during project implementation.
4.18        Beneficiary participation is the key to small area improvement, both in
preparation and financing. Area residents, organized by neighborhood committees, will
identify the type and scope of improvements according to their priority and affordability,
prepare, partly finance and implement them. While many Chinese neighborhoods have long
practiced self-help maintenance and minor repairs, the scope of upgrading under the project



20
would require substantially higher levels of organizational and engineering efforts.
Consultants will be retained for facilitating participatory process, evaluating technical
options, designing and managing the detailed engineering works. District governments,
traditionally responsible for neighborhood-level infrastructure, will play the main
coordinating role, providing managerial and financial assistance on behalf of the municipal
government on the basis of agreements with neighborhood committees.
4.19         Beneficiaries' contribution of substantial part of the costs is another essential
requirement for feasible and sustainable upgrading. It imposes the necessary budget
constraint on the beneficiary-driven investment, and makes it affordable to municipalities
which focus on large scale trunk infrastructure works and hence have been able to devote
little resources on small scale improvements. One should note that most new and re-
development projects are commercially financed and, though more expensive than
upgrading, place little financial and management burden on municipalities and often
contribute to municipal revenues. While small scale upgrading would also benefit from
loan financing, experience of upgrading projects in other countries has shown that it is
frequently impractical to recover the cost through small installments from beneficiaries after
implementation. It would be better, therefore, to secure the beneficiary contribution to the
extent possible at the time of implementation.
4.20         Beneficiaries of small area improvement would contribute the required labor
either in kind or in money, and IDA would finance materials, equipment, and technical
services in engineering, management and social works. IDA financing will be subject to a
maximum of 70% of total cost or $100 per resident, whichever is less. In most cases these
limits are not likely to apply, and IDA credit is estimated to finance 50-70% of the total
cost. The beneficiaries will finance 30-50%. Municipal and District governments will
finance the remainder, and will take responsibility for repayment of the credit. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that small area improvement subprojects would be
selected and implemented according to criteria, procedures, and schedules satisfactory to
the Bank Group, as described above.
D. Managing the Lijiang
4.21         An important objective of the project is to augment the water flow in the
Lijiang during the dry season. Beyond the physical measures to better store and release
water, financed under the project, sustaining the benefit would require broad improvements
in the way water resources are managed in the Lijiang basin. Increased population and
economic activities in the basin generated higher demand for water, and the lack of
effective control of the water use is a major factor contributing to the critical fluctuation of
the water level of the Lijiang. The necessary coordination of distribution and monitoring of
water flow is made difficult due to the existence of two local jurisdictions at the same level,
Guilin Prefecture and Municipality, as well as the Regional Water and Power Bureau which
controls the largest water works in the area, Qingshitan reservoir, with different sets of
interests.



21
4.22         In order to improve the coordination among these authorities, the Regional
Government decided to establish a high-level Commission representing the interested parties
and headed by a Vice Governor. The Commission is expected to help facilitate
consultation and joint planning and implementation of certain activities such as preparation
of water registry and monitoring. Progress in integrating the separate operations would
depend most critically on resolution of inherent jurisdictional conflict. The project will
support technical assistance and training to improve efficiency of water releases and
distribution which would be useful regardless of organizational framework, while
supporting activities toward developing an integrated management of the Lijiang.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GAR would establish a Commission to
coordinate water resources management in the Lijiang basin by June 30, 1999 with
composition and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank Group to improve and
progressively integrate the management of the water use and discharge in the basin.
4.23         A related issue is the lack of effective pricing of water as a scarce resource.
This makes it difficult to control demand for water, and also makes many projects that are
economically beneficial to be financially not feasible. Control of water use and discharges
has improved significantly in recent years especially in urban areas, partly with large
increases in water and wastewater charges. However, pricing and control of agricultural
water use appear to be difficult as elsewhere, and the institutional action plan discussed
above will include actions to rationalize raw water pricing. In order to induce upstream
water authorities to better control their water distribution and to ensure financial viability of
the hydraulic investments under the project, GM has agreed to pay GP for augmentation of
Lijiang flow as it enters the city during the dry season, as measured by an agreed method.
This will take place after Wulixia works are completed, in about 2002. Agreeemtns were
reached during negotiations on the principles for setting the payment by benefiaries
including GM (Refer to Annex 6). The payment, combined with revenues from additional
power generation, should allow the Wulixia management office to recover at least the
operating costs, debt service, and a reasonable return on their investments.
E. Industrial Pollution Control
4.24         In most cities of China, point sources, mostly industrial plants, account for a
major share of water pollution discharges. In Nanning, for example, about 50 industries
located in the Chaoyang stream catchment were responsible for about two thirds of COD
load in the stream; and of this over 80% was generated by 10 largest polluters. In Guilin,
thanks to the stringent pollution control and industrial relocation programs implemented
over several years, industries are less of a concern but still contribute a significant part of
water pollution. At least as important as the sewerage investments, therefore, are actions to
reduce the industrial pollution discharges. NM and GM have committed to addressing the
issue with enforcement and support for significant industrial polluters to reduce or pretreat
their discharges either to meet the surface water discharge standards, or to the quality
suitable for adequate treatment by the waste water treatment plants, including the two to be
built in Nanning. In the latter case, special sewerage user charges would be paid.
Assurances will be obtained during negotiations that NM and GM would carry out action
plans satisfactory to the Bank Group to reduce industrial pollution discharges to major



22
urban waterways. Time bound action plans would be provided by negotiations, listing
target quality standards for discharges and deadlines by each significant industrial polluter.
4.25        Strong enforcement of environmental regulations requires effective
compliance monitoring, a major responsibility of EPBs. Generally in China, EPBs depend
excessively on self-reporting and stationary monitoring, with weak results. In Guangxi, the
Regional and local EPBs suffer from a serious lack of manpower and equipment required
for effective monitoring, particularly mobile monitoring. In order to improve monitoring
and enforcement, the project would provide support for all participating jurisdictions to
upgrade their environmental monitoring through improved analytical equipment and
mobility for inspections, and through training programs for management and skills
upgrading.
F. Sugar Refineries Pollution Abatement
4.26        Guangxi is the most important sugar producing and refining area in China.
Sugar refineries generate about 10% of Guangxi's total industrial output, but 75% of total
industrial water pollution. They were found by a recent study to be competitive with those
in other major producer countries though the average size is smaller. There are more than
100 sugar refineries in Guangxi, most of them small and medium size enterprises. Such
enterprises in China as a group have been competitive and profitable with little support
from formal financing system. Though they have received relatively strong support in
Guangxi due to their importance, the priority in financial allocation has been given to major
technical renovations, leaving little to support pollution control in existing plants. However,
GAR has stopped issuing licenses for new refineries, and expansion is allowed only for
those meeting discharge standards. Many refineries have adopted various low-cost, locally
available technologies to reduce the pollution discharges. While there are a few successful
examples, their applicability or effectiveness has been limited. Internationally, several
proven technologies are available for efficient treatment, reuse, or minimization of waste
water.
4.27        The project will allocate $2 million for a few subloans to finance costs of
such technologies and equipment, subject to a maximum of 50% of subproject total cost or
$2 million, whichever is lower, for any individual sub-project. Subloans are expected to
range between $0.7 - 1.0 million, and finance about 40% of the total cost. Its maturity will
be 7 years including 2 years' grace and the interest rate will be 1.5 % above the LIBOR-
based standard single currency US dollar loan rate. Technically, the subprojects would be
required to, among others, enable cost-effective reduction of pollution discharges and
compliance with environmental regulations, and be consistent with the Region's
environmental priorities. Financially, borrowing refineries should have been profitable at
least two out of past three years, be projected to generate internal cash flow not less than
1.4 times the projected annual debt requirement during the term of the subloan, and pledge
collateral at least 1.2 times the subloan value.
4.28        The subloans will be managed by a Unit under GUEPO, with full-time staff
seconded from the Sugar Corporation and the Regional EPB. The subloan decisions will be



23
made by these staff as well as representatives of the Regional Finance Bureau, Planning and
Economic Commissions. Financial transactions and supervision will be carried out by the
Region's Finance Bureau system. The Unit and the other representatives of the Region will
appraise subproject proposals, prepared by the borrowers, based on technical appraisal by a
technical institute appointed by the Board, and financial appraisal by a commercial bank.
The Bank Group will review all subproject proposals recommended by the Unit.
Assurances were be obtained during negotiations that GAR will establish the Guangxi
Sugar Pollution Control Project Unit with staffing, funding, and terms of reference
satisfactory to the Bank Group; and cause it to make and manage sugar refinery pollution
abatement subloans with assistance of competent consultants on terms and conditions and
according to criteria and procedures satisfactory to the Bank Group.

5. Project Implementation Arrangements
A. Organizations and Plans
5.1             Local administrative bureaus have been managing the preparation of individual
components under their normal line responsibilities, and would continue to oversee their
implementation. Local governments and their administrative units responsible for various
components are listed in Table 5.1 below.

5.2         To coordinate implementation by these units, each local government has
established a Project Management Office (PMO) which include staff drawn from EPB, Finance
Bureau, and Construction Bureau. They report to a vice mayor of NM, vice secretary general of
GM, and Administrator of GP, respectively. Guangxi Regional Government has similarly
established a Guangxi Urban Environment Project Office (GUEPO) headed by a vice director of
Regional EPB, reporting to a Vice Governor. It would be supported by GAR Finance Bureau
and Planning Commission. Experiences in other Bank-supported projects suggest that activities
within each local government would be well coordinated, provided that the PMO includes senior
personnel experienced in financial and construction management of similar major projects.
Assurances were be obtained during negotiations that the beneficiary local governments will
maintain project leading groups and project management offices with staffing and terms of
reference satisfactory to the Bank Group.
5.3         Implementation Plans have been prepared for individual components, and
consolidated by jurisdiction and for the entire project and are placed in the project file. The
plans specify: detailed costs, financing, preparation, procurement, implementation and
supervision arrangements, monitoring indicators, project scheduling, and procurement packaging.
B. On-Lending and Disbursement
5.4         Assurances were be obtained during negotiations that:
GOC will on-lend the loan proceeds to GAR for a maturity of 20 years including 5 years'
grace, and on-lend the credit proceeds to GAR for a maturity of 17 years including 5
years' grace, at the same interest rates and charges as received from the Bank Group;
and
GAR will on-lend the loan and credit proceeds, other than those required for the
components implemented by itself, to NM, GM, and GP for implementation of respective
parts of the project on the same terms as received from GOC.
5.5          A proposed schedule of disbursement is shown in Table 5.2. Approximately
52.5% of costs incurred by each jurisdiction would be financed with the loan and credit. For the
purpose of bid evaluation and payment, each of the contracts to design, build and equip pumping
stations and sewage treatment plants would be divided into two packages, one for design and
construction and another for equipment supply and installation. Disbursement for the former will
be made under the works category, and the latter under the goods category.
5.6         A Special Account will be established and maintained in US dollars by the
Guangxi Regional Finance Bureau on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank Group. The
Account will have an authorized allocation of $4.5 million, approximately equal to average
projected disbursements over four months. Replenishment application would be submitted
monthly or when the balance falls below 50% of the authorized allocation, whichever comes first.
Disbursements will be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditures (SOE) for (a) training, (b)
consultant contracts less than $50,000, (c) contracts for goods valued at less than $200,000 each,
and (d) contracts for works valued at less than $2 million. Full documentation will be needed for
disbursement for others. GUEPO will retain the documents supporting the SOE and make them
available to Bank Group missions for inspection.

loan and credit accounts to close by December 31, 2004. The schedule of projected
disbursement, based on the standard disbursement profile of urban sanitation projects in China, is
shown in Annex 12.
5.8         Retroactive fmancing up to $7 million equivalent will be provided for eligible
expenditures made after December 31, 1997 for consultants services and training, civil works for
construction of sewers at Chaoyang in Nanning and Qintan in Guilin, and construction of landfill
in Guilin, and procurement of equipment for project management offices.
C. Procurement Arrangements
5.9         Goods. The project is estimated to require equipment and materials costing about
$43 million in total, including equipment procured as part of four turnkey contracts to design,
build and equip three sewage treatment plants and a small power generating station. About $30
million worth of the goods, or about 75 % of the total, will be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB). National competitive bidding (NCB) will be employed to procure
goods more than $100,000 but not exceeding $200,000 per package, up to an aggregate amount
of $6.9 million. These include standard construction materials, such as small-diameter sewer
pipes, used for small area improvement, and plant seedlings used in Wulixia and Lijiang soil
conservation components. Small quantities of tools and materials mainly for the small area
improvement and office equipment used for project management and studies, less than $100,000
per contract and up to an aggregate amount of $2.5 million, will be procured through comparison
of price quotations from at least three qualified suppliers. Specialized equipment and process
licenses for sugar pollution control financed under the subloans will be procured by the
beneficiary refineries through international competitive bidding except those costing less than $1
million, which may be procured through shopping procedures. Other items, goods and works not
financed by the Bank, will be procured by acceptable commercial practices.



27
5.10          Civil Works for the project will be commissioned mostly through about 40
contracts between $50,000 and $8 million, procured through NCB. Potential bidders for major
interceptors, pumping stations, STPs and tunnelling work, requiring special skills or equipment,
will be prequalified. Some works will be bid under the supply and install contracts through ICB.
Contractors for small works of plantation and sewer rehabilitation costing less than $50,000
equivalent per contract and up to $2.0 million in aggregate, may be chosen through comparison
of price quotations from at least three qualified contractors. Electrical main connections and
installations associated to these works will be made by local power companies through direct
contracting, and will not be financed by the Bank Group. Civil works for small area
improvement will be carried out by beneficiaries with their own labor and at times supplemented
by contract labor hired through direct contracting. Neither will be financed by the Bank Group,
other than technical services discussed below.

5.11          Consultancy and Training. The project would involve consultancy and training,
estimated to cost about $4.0 million. A major part of the studies and training would be carried
out under three consultant packages and associated training for institutional development for
sewerage, environmental protection, and water resource management. Others include small
consultant studies on Guilin solid waste transfer system and Nanning nightsoil management
database system development costing between $100,000 and $200,000. The rest would be a



28
large number of small consultant services, each less than $50,000, to help supervise
implementation of major works and to help neighborhoods prepare and implement small area
improvement component. Most consultants would be selected competitively on the basis of
quality and cost. Small contracts for systems design and advisory services for sewerage and
environmental protection institutions would be selected on the basis of quality. Services to
facilitate participation and help prepare and manage small area improvement programs would be
procured as service delivery contracts, for which non-governmental organizations would be
eligible to compete. All consultant contracts would be listed in general procurement notices in
the Development Business (UNDB) and the expression of interest for the three largest contracts
would be invited through advertisement in UNDB and national newspapers. The terms of
reference for the establishment of the Lijiang Commission will be finalized before negotiations.
5.12         Procedures and Management. The procurement plan for the project is
summarized in Table 5.3 and contract packages are listed in Annex 13. Procurement under the
project will follow the "Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated
January 1995 as revised in January and August of 1996, and "Guidelines: Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated January 1997 and revised in
September 1997. Model Bidding Documents agreed between GOC and the Bank Group will be
used for all contracts. The Bank Group's prior review procedures will apply to all ICB
packages, civil works packages with estimated value over $2 million, consultant firm contracts
over $100,000 and individual consultant contracts over $50,000. These are expected to cover
about 80% of all procurement value under the project. Bank Group missions will carry out ex
post review of a selection of others. Under ICB for goods, domestic suppliers will be given a
margin of preference equal to 15% of CIF price or applicable customs duties and taxes,
whichever is less. For turnkey contracts mentioned above the same domestic preference will be
applied to the equipment which will be priced separately. No preference will be applied to
works. Foreign bidders will be allowed to participate in NCB.
D. Resettlement and Land Acquisition
5.13         Facilities to be built under the project would occupy some 110 ha (or 102 ha) of
land permanently, and require resettlement of 926 people. About 27 ha required mainly for a
solid waste landfill and some for sewage treatment plants in Guilin has been owned by the local
government for some years. Of the remaining land to be acquired for the project, the major part
consists of 70 ha of an abandoned brick yard in Nanning to be used for a new sewage treatment
plant. Components to be designed during the project implementation, the small area
improvement sugar refinery pollution control subprojects would be carried out within the
premises of the neighborhoods and borrowing refineries and therefore involve not land
acquisition or resettlement.
5.14         The only resettlement in the project is required for sewering the densely built-up
center of Nanning along the Chaoyang stream. The originally proposed design for the
component was radically altered during project preparation mainly as it would have required
resettling over 5,000 people. The design adopted for the project requires clearing of 5 ha,
demolition and replacement of 13,000 m2 of buildings and resettlement of 926 persons. They
will be resettled in larger housing units in an apartment complex being built near the area, and
given moving compensation. Thirty households identified as vulnerable people on account of
their low income, ill health, and old age will be given special additional support to ensure they



29
maintain their income and access to necessary services. Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has
been prepared for the Chaoyang stream area in full consultation with the affected people. The
RAP specify responsible organizations at various levels and procedures to inform and assist the
affected people in a timely manner during implementation, including grievance procedures, and
monitoring and reporting arrangements. The project authority retained an independent institute
for monitoring and evaluation, who also participated in preparation of the RAP. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that NM will carry out the resettlement and rehabilitation of affected
persons according to a plan (the RAP) satisfactory to the Bank Group and report their progress
included in the project progress reports.
E. Accounting and Auditing
5.15         Local government departments keep their recurrent accounts according to the state
standard accounting system for administrative units, and for investment projects, follow the state
construction accounting system. Municipal sewerage companies to be established during the
project period will follow the standard enterprise accounting system. These standards, revised in
1994, was found to conform to internationally accepted accounting principles. Ministry of
Finance and local finance bureaus have provided extensive training in the use of the standard
accounting systems and continue to provide guidance and assistance for their use. Implementing
units of the project components will be responsible to keep their respective detailed construction
accounts and the project office of each jurisdiction will maintain consolidated project accounts.
GUEPO will maintain consolidated accounts for the entire project.
5.16         Local Audit Bureaus, under the guidance of the State Audit Administration (SAA),
have carried out auditing of most projects the Bank Group financed. The arrangement has been
found satisfactory. The Guangxi Regional Audit Bureau will provide the necessary audit services
for the project under the same arrangements. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
GAR will submit to the Bank Group annual audit reports on the following within six months after
the end of each fiscal year starting from fiscal year 1999:
(a)   the Special Account;
(b)   the statements of expenditures;
(c)   the project accounts consolidated and maintained by GUEPO and Nanning and
Guilin PMOs; and
(d)   the financial statements of Nanning and Guilin sewerage entities, including the
statements of flow of funds and the compliance with the financial covenants.
F. Monitoring and Supervision
5.17         Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GUEPO will submit quarterly
progress reports according to a format satisfactory to the Bank Group by the end of January,
April, July, and October of each year, starting from October 1998. The report submitted in
April will serve as annual progress reports, including summary of implementation in the past year
and reports on the complete set of monitoring indicators. The report submitted in October will



30
include implementation plans for the coming year. GUEPO will provide an implementation
completion report within six months of project closing.
5.18         A supervision plan is shown in Annex 14. The first three years of supervision
will require relatively large efforts, about 18 staff weeks, focusing on different areas. In FY
1999, the focus would be on helping to develop implementation and monitoring arrangements,
procurement of early investment components and consultancy contracts, and detailed preparation
of procuring pumping stations and other components to be implemented initially. A Launch
Workshop will be held in about November 1998. Another major assistance focus during FY
1999 and 2000 would be the institutional development of the Sewerage Companies. In FY 2000,
large engineering input would be required to review the actual sewage flows and projected future
flows to Jiangnan and Xicheng STPs. A mid-term review will be held in late 2001 for strategic
assessment of project implementation and prospects. In later years, the supervision would
require about 15 staff-weeks per year.

6. BENEFITS, RISKS, AND ALTERNATIVES
A. Environmental Impacts
6.1          The project is rated environmental category A in view of its large environmental
impacts. While the project components would bring major environmental improvements, they
would give rise to some environmental risks. In accordance with a GOC regulation governing
externally assisted project, which is consistent with the Bank's Operational Directive,
comprehensive Environmental Impact Assessment studies (EA) have been carried out by a
qualified national institution covering all project components except the programs of small area
improvement and sewer repairs, whose details will be determined during the project period. The
full documents have been placed in the project files and are summarized in Annex 15. The EA
has been approved by NEPA and reviewed by the Bank Group. A resettlement action plan has
been prepared separately and summarized in Section 5.D and Annex 8.
6.2          The most important environmental risk is to the quality of Yong River water at the
new discharge point of waste water collected from Nanning urban areas. Currently some of the
waste water is absorbed to the ground, and the rest is discharged into the River at several
dispersed locations and assimilated by the River. Compared with this current situation, better
collection of waste water into a single discharge point would significantly raise the level of
pollution at the new discharge point. A quantitative model was built to analyze the impact of the
new sewerage system on the water quality of Yong River. The results indicate that: the water
quality upstream of the new discharge point would improve from the current Class III and IV to
Class II and III; discharge of untreated sewage at the new location would push the water quality
immediately downstream from the current Class IV to Class V in a near future; and tertiary
treatment of most of the urban sewage would be required to upgrade the water quality at the
location to Class III. Based on evaluation of alternative levels of treatment, the project includes
fmancing for a treatment plant that would prevent the newly collected wastewater from worsening
the water quality at the discharge point and would provide a basis for future expansion.
6.3          Another potential environment risk is associated with the sludge that needs to be
dredged from the Chaoyang stream bed. The characteristics of the sludge has been analyzed, and
a safe disposal site, in addition to the existing landfill, has been secured. Other significant
potential adverse environmental impacts of the project as a whole are temporary increases in
noise, dust, and traffic disruption during construction. Measures to control these to a minimum
have been specified and will be implemented during the project. The project addresses some of
the most pressing environmental issues well recognized and given high priority by the local
governments. Environmental master plan studies and a study of Lijiang basin water resource
issues carried out during project preparation (placed in the Project Files) have confirmed these
priorities and also establish strategic frameworks to deal with overall environmental issues in the
long term.



32
B. Analysis of Benefits and Alternatives
6.4          The project is entirely devoted to environmental improvements, particularly to the
control of water pollution, which in turn would improve health, ecology, aesthetics, water
supply, recreation. Different components of the project aim at different combinations of the
multi-dimensional benefits. By and large these benefits are difficult to evaluate quantitatively due
to the involved data and value judgments. Partly for this reason the basic issue of the whether
the intended benefits are worth the cost is addressed only at a general level, using approximate
benefit-cost measures to illuminate the local governments' priorities. Economic analysis was
focused on clarifying the nature of the benefits expected of each component and its elements, and
identifying options to obtain the benefits in terms of the counterfactual and scope as well as
technological alternatives. For some benefits such as an increase in raw water availability,
quantitative cost-benefit analysis was necessary and feasible. In other cases, benefits could be
compared only by orders of magnitude. The analysis was based on the discount rate of 12% and
the conversion factor of one for most inputs, according to the Bank's review of market prices of
urban factors. In many other cases, other analytical criteria and procedures were decisive in
guiding the evaluation of options. These analyses led to significant reformulation of the project
during preparation. Major benefits and alternatives considered for large components are
discussed below.
6.5          Sewerage works in Nanning, which account for a major portion of project
investment, can be classified into three groups in terms of their impacts: (i) improving drainage
of sewage and storm water in the city areas housing about 70% of the urban population; (ii)
conveying it to a location downstream for discharge into Yongjiang, and (iii) treating the sewage
at that location. The main benefit from the first group of sewerage works, as well as nightsoil
management and small area improvements, would be a reduction in water-borne diseases. While
recognizing the limitations, an attempt was made for a rough valuation in view of the importance
of this type of benefits. Various public health reports indicate that the incidence of such diseases
in Nanning is around a third higher than national average, whereas the rate in Guilin is almost a
third less. Given that other conditions are similar, the difference in morbidity rate can be
attributable largely to the levels of sewerage services, better than most in Guilin and worse than
most in Nanning. Inferring from a World Development Report (1993) estimate for China as a
whole, the burden of diarrhea and hepatitis in Nanning is estimated to be about Y 90 million a
year. Assuming that the sewerage improvement could bridge 80% of the gap between the two
cities by 2003 and the value increases with income and population by about 12% a year for the
first 10 years and 8% afterwards, the present value (PV) of the benefit discounted by 12% over
30 years would be about Y 590 million. Taking into account other illnesses, reported in a small
survey taken during project preparation, the PV of benefits can be estimated at about Y 1280
million. On the other hand, PV of relevant investments under the project and complementary
investments and O&M is estimated to be about Y 490 million, indicating a benefit-cost ratio in
the neighborhood of about 2. (The estimation is discussed in more detail in Annex 1.)
6.6          Improved sewerage would also reduce bad odor and sight which are acute in the
commercial center of the city along the Chaoyang Stream, and improve the land value of the
area, were there an active property market. Current land value of some 100 ha of directly
affected commercial and residential plots in the city center is imputed to be about Y 3 billion.
This indicates that the value of the ambient improvement could be more important than health
benefits for this particular area. A major issue for the project was evaluating the original



33
proposal that focused on this ambient benefit in the city center. The original proposal to improve
the lower 3 km of Chaoyang stream would have cost about Y 400 million, compared with Y 150
million allocated to the same section under the finally agreed option. The additional investment
would have allowed realigning and expanding the stream course to add flood retention capacity
and recreational space. The additional flood management capacity, however, would be worth
less than Y 15 million, PV of additional capital and operating costs of extra pumping capacity.
The odor would be reduced under either option, and it was doubtful if the other proposed
improvements such as additional recreational space would pay for themselves through land value
increments of nearby plots, especially considering that most of the extra cost would have been
incurred in the form of about 20 ha more land cleared than now planned. On the other hand,
these expenditures would have left little resources for providing sewers in other areas of the city,
foregoing the major part of the health benefit discussed above.
6.7          The second group of works, to convey intercepted sewage across the Yongjiang,
would protect the quality of water for a city water intake located on the downstream of the
discharge point of Chaoyang and Erkeng streams. It is projected that the water quality
deterioration, if allowed to continue at the present rate, would make it necessary to relocate the
intake in about six years, at an estimated cost of about Y 120 million. This savings, discounted
by 12% a year, would be equivalent to a PV of about Y 60 million. This alone would justify the
investment and operating costs for this element, whose PV is about Y 48 million.
6.8          A trade-off within the fiscal limitation was the main consideration in determining
the level and volume of treatment of the collected sewage. The current water quality of
Yongjiang at the point of discharge from the proposed STP is rated Class IV during the dry
season. A water quality model indicated that the quality would be upgraded to Class III only if a
major part of urban waste water is collected and treated to the tertiary level. A major economic
benefit of improving from Class IV to Class III would be to allow intake of drinking water,
which is not relevant in this case, and improve fisheries and recreation, whose values are hard to
quantify but unlikely to exceed even the operating cost of such a STP, over Y 10 million per
year. Given the constraints of fiscal resources and likely affordability limit on sewerage charges,
a higher level and larger capacity of treatment would mean less sewage collection for the next
decade or more. This would defeat the purpose of sewerage improvement. The treatment level
and capacity therefore have been determined so as to maximize sewage collection and treat it at
the primary level. This would leave the quality of water at the discharge point equal or better
than the current one in most important pollutants. Further, the STP will provide a substantial
base for expansion and upgrading in the future when they would be affordable.
6.9          Environment and Tourism. Broad environmental qualities beyond health
concerns are given more attention in considering sewerage in Guilin, due mainly to the
importance of tourism. About 8 million domestic tourists and 350,000 foreign tourists visit
Guilin annually, attracted mainly by the cruise on the Lijiang downstream of Guilin city. It is
estimated that close to 20% of GDP in Guilin area is generated directly from tourism industry,
and including activities directly supporting the industry and its employees, about 30% GDP, or Y
2.5 billion a year. A recent survey on tourists' satisfaction with eight environmental aspects
found high levels of dissatisfaction with the level of water in Lijiang (though the survey was in
April, after the driest season) and cleanliness of city streets and Taohuajiang, a Lijiang tributary
and main city stream. The importance of Lijiang water level is corroborated by the fact that the
number of foreign tourists drops to half during the three driest months, January to March. The



34
emphases on the latter two urban elements are consistent with the fact that tourists spend
considerable time in the city itself, and indicates the importance of urban environment to tourism
as much as Lijiang itself. In the survey the tourists also stated that they would stay about 50%
longer on average, if the environmental problems they perceive are solved. While this would
imply a contingent valuation of over a billion yuan a year in terms of additional GDP, various
constraints on both demand and supply sides would limit the extent this will be realized. Further,
unless one can define "satisfactory environmental improvements", it is not possible to allocate the
potential benefit to different types of improvements, and then to specific investments which
contribute partly to these improvements. Therefore, economic analysis of proposed components
with primary objective of improving various aspects of the Lijiang has relied on alternative
evaluations, using the benefits related to tourism only as a reference.
6.10         Sewerage and Solid Waste Management in Guilin. Improved environmental
health would be the major concrete benefit of the investments for solid waste landfill and city
sewers in Guilin, at a cost per beneficiary (about Y 650 per capita) similar to that in Nanning.
Due to the higher level of environmental health in Guilin, the marginal benefits would be lower,
but would be supplemented by tourism-related benefits. During project preparation, the main
focus of the sewerage components in Guilin has shifted from the latter to the former, not due to
revaluation of relative importance of the two objectives, but mainly based on assessment of least
cost options and the time horizon. Whereas the original proposal focused on expansion of
sewage treatment (secondary level), it was determined that the existing capacity of two STPs in
the southern part of the city would not be fully utilized for the next several years. Higher
priority for the immediate future would be to increase their utilization, expand sewerage
collection, and expand a north-western STP which is operating over capacity. These measures
would have a significant impact in reducing pollution in Taohuajiang, whose water quality is
currently rated between Class IV and V.
6.11         For a proposed STP in Xicheng, a newly developing industrial suburb of Guilin,
the proposed timing was delayed and scope was reduced based on the economic analysis that
showed that its population and wastewater generation is likely to grow more slowly than earlier
projected, and that capital and operating cost of a secondary sewage treatment would exceed the
affordability of the area residents and the area governrnent. Both factors imply a high risk of
idling the facilities if built as originally proposed. The original proposal also called for building
trunk and secondary sewers for new developments. However, this was replaced by support for
sewers in the old existing area within Xicheng, given that the new developments are essentially
commercial and speculative and call for short-term commercial financing. Another group of
proposed sewerage investments in another newly development area north of Guilin city was
rejected for almost the same reasons as above.
6.12         Water Works. The Wulixia water works would add about 7 m3/second of water
to Lijiang during the dry season. The highest economic use of the water would be the supply for
urban uses, probably higher than the more emphasized benefit of helping the Lijiang cruise. In
fact, water supply of the city and towns along the river is seriously constrained during the dry
season, requiring occasional rationing. A major portion of the additional water would be used
for urban water supply. Its value during the dry season may be assessed at least Y 0.5/m3, in
view of the valuation of about Y 1-2/m3 in dry northern provinces. The process of diverting,
storing, and releasing the water also provides flows for electricity generation. In Guilin area,
marginal price of electricity, bought from thermal power plants, is Y 0.4/kwh. Including



35
environmental costs of thermal generation, the economic value of the hydropower would be
around Y 0.5/kwh. The PV of these economic benefits (minus operating costs and discounted at
12% a year) is estimated to be about Y 205 million, 7 times the investment cost. This
extraordinary high rate of return can be attributed largely to the utilization of the existing Wulixia
reservoir and associated facilities. Although the reservoir was built for irrigation purpose, a
large part of the water finds little economic use during the dry season due to the conversion of
much of the farmland to more profitable alternative crops and orchards.
6.13         The original proposal for the project included other, much larger water works to
supplement the Lijiang flow. The largest part of the original proposal was a group of water
works in a river basin west of Lijiang (Huangsha and Xunjiang), partly to transfer water to
Taohuajiang and Lijiang. These would have been largely new water structures, and their costs
could be justified only if and when the value of water in terms of tourism or water supply is
increased over twice the level indicated above, which could be the case in a medium-term future.
Another part of the original proposal was to transfer water from Xiaorongjiang, a Lijiang
tributary, to a large existing reservoir that is underutilized. These water works were evaluated to
be economically justified strongly, with a benefit-cost ratio of about two. However, they could
not be included in the project as the Regional authority that manages the reservoir could not
reach agreement with Guilin Municipality, on the latter's payment for the additional water.
6.14         Benefits of repairing and building embankments along the Lijiang were evaluated
on the basis of the record of loss of crop land, roads, and plants to the floods of 1992 and 1993,
which are considered typical, recurrent floods. The losses were estimated to have cost about Y
18 million. Over 20 years, these losses would amount to a PV of about Y 66 million, compared
with Y 48 million, the PV of the cost of embankments and their maintenance. While an
important motivation was aesthetic value for tourism, it is difficult to make a direct link.
Therefore, the above analysis was used as criteria for the selection of embankment sections to be
financed under the project. Details of this and the water works components discussed above,
including economic evaluation, are available in the feasibility report (see Annex 15: Documents
and Data in Project Files).
C. Poverty and Social Considerations
6.15         The project as a whole is expected to have strong poverty alleviation effects due to
four features: its location in Guangxi, its focus on environmental sanitation, its boost to tourism;
and more directly, small area improvement component. As in other areas, Guangxi's major
cities have been, and will continue to be, the engines of the Region's rapid economic growth, as
discussed in Chapter 2. Visible improvements to the physical environment are expected to
provide a significant help in attracting business investment and tourism to Nanning and Guilin.
Urban economic growth lead to poverty alleviation not only by propagation of economic growth
through linkages across sectors and areas, but more directly by rural-to-urban migration
providing outlets for the pressure of population and poverty in the countryside. This effect has
been stronger in major cities of Guangxi compared with other regions of the country, as their
growth has been particularly fast and they have been much more open and accommodating to
rural migrants. Migration added nearly 4% a year to the population of Nanning and Guilin since
1990, an unusually high rate in China.



36
6.16         It has been shown worldwide that the poor, while obtaining more income and job
opportunities in fast growing cities, suffer disproportionately from poor environmental health.
Focusing on improvements in environmental sanitation, the large part of project benefits are
expected to accrue to the poor. Another significant part of the intended project benefit, aid to
tourism, would also favor the poor as tourism industry employs a large number of unskilled
workers. It is noteworthy that this pattern of benefit incidence for the poor coincides with that
for women and for minorities. A gender impact study conducted for the project has found that
women are more exposed to environmental sanitation and heavily represented in the tourism
industry. Ethnic minorities, who constitute a near majority in Guangxi, are represented more
among the new and poor residents of the cities than among long-term residents of the cities.
6.17         The project targets poverty more directly through the small area improvement
component, although the criteria for selecting beneficiary areas do not explicitly emphasize
residents' income levels. Rather, the selection criteria and financing parameters consist of
conditions of physical environment and the participation of the residents. Main reasons for doing
so are discussed in Chapter 4: limited validity of cash earnings as a measure of real income, and
the desire to support low-cost, in-situ improvement as an efficient alternative to wholesale new
development, regardless of the residents' income levels. Nevertheless, sample household surveys
in the areas identified so far show that most of the area residents (over 70%) work in informal or
small business sectors, and their average income per capita, about Y 230 per month, is only
about half of the city averages including imputed value of in-kind benefits.
D. Risks and Sustainability
6.18         Compared with similar projects in China, the project is expected to have above-
average risk of implementation and sustainability. While similar Bank-financed projects have a
satisfactory implementation record as a whole, they have commonly incurred costs and delays
mainly during the start-up stage, due to initial difficulties in using Bank Group's procedures
especially for procurement and difficulties of coordination among agencies and jurisdictions.
These difficulties could be more serious for this project, partly due to the project complexity and
partly due to the relative lack of institutional and technical capacity and experience. Various
steps have been taken during project preparation to reduce the risks: exchange visits between
project officials in Guangxi and those in other cities of China implementing similar projects;
training in procedures by the Ministry of Finance and the Bank Resident Mission; retaining of an
experienced procurement agency; and turn-key packaging of more complex works and equipment.
An Australian grant has been committed to provide limited assistance in implementation of
physical investments and institutional development components during the start-up phase.
Nevertheless, the difficulties are expected to remain, and it would be important to maintain
competent project management offices at various levels, competent supervision engineers and
other consultants are retained, and the project progress is monitored systematically.
6.19         Financial and Institutional Risks. Counterpart financing has grown increasingly
problematic for projects in China in recent years due to the fiscal transition and stabilization. In
view of this, careful analysis has been carried out and appropriate financing sources arranged
secured to ensure adequate financing the project. (Refer to Sections 4.A and 4.B). A more
important issue is securing an adequate financial resources for continuing operation of the newly
added sewerage assets. Tariff increases implemented already by NM and GM as well as further
increases being proposed provide a better-than-average assurance on this count. However, the



37
covenant on financial self-sufficiency of sewerage operations would have to be monitored
carefully especially during the later part of project period. Also, particularly in Nanning, it
would be essential that an adequate institution is developed to manage the vastly increased
sewerage facilities. A major focus of the supervision and technical assistance would therefore be
on the formulation of an institutional development plan and its implementation.
6.20         Regulatory Risks. The main project benefit of water quality improvement would
be limited in extent and in duration without regulation of point source pollution discharges.
Therefore commitments of NM and GM will be obtained to the pollution control action plans as
an integral part of the project, and the Regional sugar pollution control plan would be an essential
element of subproject appraisal. Risks with implementation of these plans appear much less than
those with environmental protection programs associated with other similar projects for two
reasons: the pollution control plans are much more specific, and the record of at least one city,
GM, is much better than most other localities in China.
6.21         Economic Risks. Sewerage services, and also to a large extent, industrial
pollution control are expensive and therefore the demand for them have to be supported by
considerable levels of income. To a large measure, the investment in the sewerage and other
sanitation services and the industrial pollution action plans are predicated on the strong prospect
of continued and fast economic growths in both cities, and tourism in the case of Guilin. If for
any reason the city economies slow down or deteriorate, it would be difficult to keep up the
services and pollution regulation. However, relatively little risk of economic downturn is
foreseen for the medium term.
6.22         Small Area Improvements would differ considerably from existing practices in
Chinese municipalities, requiring higher levels of beneficiary participation and less reliance on
formal engineering standards. Risks are an unavoidable, and almost integral, element of the
required innovations and experimentation. Hence monitoring and managing the risks and benefits
would be an essential aspect of the component implementation. Subcomponents will be prepared
and implemented as an experiment, starting with several schemes to be carried out in the first
year or two, monitoring and evaluating the implementation and results, and modifying and
expanding them based on experience.
6.23         Water Works for Lijiang, though a small and least risky part of the originally
proposed scheme, still present some remaining risks that need to be recognized and managed.
Given that water works in general have taken long to complete, these relatively small works
(costing Y 30 million) have been given high levels of efforts for studies and design, and will be
given more time and management resources for implementation. Even after the works are
completed as planned, there is a high probability (about 30%) that they would fall short of the
target of adding 7 m3/sec to Lijiang during the dry season, for natural and managerial reasons.
Fortunately, however, the components would remain viable even with serious shortfall, as seen
above in para 6.13. Improvement in overall management of water resources in the Lijiang basin
would be an essential element to ensure sustainability, but the project will pursue a limited
objective in this area, as discussed in Section 4.D.

Sewerage and Drainage in Nanning
Status of Water Resources, Drainage and Sewerage Systems
1.    Nanning city, with an urban population of about a million, is situated on the northern
and southern banks of the Yongjiang (Yongjiang River), which originates from Yunnan
province, about 500 km to the west, and joins the Pearl River. The River, as it traverses the
city in a southeasterly course, is about 300 meters wide and has an annual average flow of
1,300 m3/sec. The flow rate varies widely, with annual average dry season flow of about
250 m3/sec and the 20-year flood flow of about 15,000 m3/sec. As most of the city area
elevation is below the 20 year flood level (78 m above sea), protection levees have been
built over the years to protect against this level. A major upstream dam (Baise Dam) now
being planned would provide an additional measure of flood protection. The Yongjiang is
the primary source of the municipal water supply, drawn from six points along the River.
Close to 20% of the total water used in the city is also supplied from more than 132
industrial and private wells.
2.    The urbanized areas of the city are drained by six tributaries of the Yongjiang.
Chaoyang stream serves the largest catchment area that includes the main city area north of
the River, housing about 30% of population and the central business district. Before
meeting the Yongjiang, it joins the Erkeng stream which drains the neighboring industrial
and residential areas north. Areas south of the river (Jiangnan area) are relatively more
recent and industrial, and drained mainly by a small Tingzi stream and Shuitang. Major new
developments are currently on-going in the area east of the current city center (Langdong),
served by the Nanhu Lake and Zhupai stream. These are all relatively small streams with
catchment areas between 3 and 15 square km. A considerable portion of the water of the
catchments is diverted to agricultural use, reducing the flow in the urban streams. Their
water levels are often lower than the Yongjiang and the flood protection levees at the
Yongjiang also impedes their flow.
3.    Nanning's sewerage and drainage system has been constructed area by area. The
system consists mostly of large diameter pipes or large size culverts and drains, with a total
length of some 380 km covering 58 km2 of the total urban area of 81 km2. In many districts
even the most basic form of a sewer network has not been put in and the secondary sewers,
primarily the responsibility of developers, has not met minimum requirements either.
4.    There is almost no separation between storm and sewage flows and the municipal
policy has been to construct drains that can contain as much floodwater as possible. As a
result, the sewers are generally too large to handle sewage flows during dry weather.
Sections of the network have a low self-cleaning capacity, causing sheet flooding and water
back-ups to occur regularly during the monsoons. Further, most of these combined drains
suffer from inadequate maintenance and repair, and are clogged by silt and debris. A recent
study of the city's sewer network conducted by the BMEDRI (Beijing Municipal



Annex 1
41                           Page 2 of 13
Engineering Design Institute) revealed that at least half of the network is badly kept up and
leaks are frequent. Sewers and drains on roads that are over 20 m wide are maintained by
the Municipal Engineering Management Administration, and smaller ones by the five
administrative Districts.
5.    All drains courses are designed to send effluent to the nearest water body. Nanning
has 16 flood pumping stations, 12 of which are located at river mouths for lifting flows into
the main river. There are no wastewater treatment facilities anywhere in the city for its
domestic sewage except septic tanks, although some industries have on-site pretreatment
facilities for their effluent.
6.    Treatment of domestic sewage depends entirely on the septic tank system.
Consultants have estimated that there are some 36,000 septic tanks in the city, virtually one
for every building in the city. The responsible government agency for nightsoil management
is the Environmental Sanitation Management Department (ESMD). Its small fleet of ten
tanker trucks serves the approximately 170 public toilets in the inner city, each with a three
compartment septic tank. When called upon, they will also service septic tanks belonging to
other buildings. During periodic cleaning, waste sludge is emptied from the tank and sent
to a composting facility where it is mixed with municipal solid waste. The plant produces
compost (which is used by farmers) and non-compostable residue (which is landfilled).
Major Issues and Actions
7.    Due to a virtual lack of sanitary sewerage system, the urban tributaries of the
Yongjiang receive most of the waste water discharges. As a result, water quality in three of
the streams -- the Erkeng, Chaoyang and Tingzi -- that drain the most densely populated
areas of the city into the Yongjiang is little different from raw sewage, as shown in Table 1
below. As a result, the water quality of the Yongjiang deteriorates seriously as it flows
through the city. Water samples from the Yongjiang show that along the river's upper
reaches, it satisfies water quality Class II (National Environmental Standard for Surface
Water, GB3838-88), suitable for drinking water source. As it passes through the city,
however, the quality worsens to Class III, quality marginally acceptable for drinking water
source, and even to Class IV at certain areas during the dry season.

Class           II          III        >V       >V        >V         > V
8.    The case for immediate action to address these problems is the need to preserve the
urban water sources. Although the considerable flowrate of the Yongjiang is sufficient to
keep the water quality from deteriorating beyond Class III level overall, the quality
deteriorates below this level at some localized areas during the dry season. This affects the



Annex 1
42                           Page 3 of 13
largest water intake of the city which is located downstream of the point where the
Chaoyang and Erkeng are discharged into the River. At present this causes occasional
stopping of water intake and high treatment costs at other times. However, it is projected
that continuation of the current trend of deterioration would force the relocation of the
intake at a high cost. Also the groundwater sources, shown to be generally good quality so
far, are threatened by sewage seeping from the deficient sewer lines, under-maintained
septic tanks, and solid waste.
9.    Another set of major problems are flooding and stagnant water. Some of the
problems are localized ones due to the incomplete and ineffective drainage system in a large
part of the urban areas. To a significant extent, however, the urban streams themselves are
rendered stagnant, due to the low flowrate which is further impeded by the flood protection
levees along the Yongjiang and the stream water level which is lower than that of the
Yongjiang.
10.   These problems are particularly significant with the Chaoyang stream and its
catchment area. The area is home to some third of the total urban population of Nanning
and the daytime population is larger as the area hosts a large part of the city's civil and
industrial activities, which are growing fast. The heavily polluted water of Chaoyang, often
stagnant, along with the built-up sludge, gives off persistent stench in the city center,
contributes the biggest organic load to the Yongjiang, and its overflow during heavy floods
results in serious epidemic outbreak. These factors make the Chaoyang stream an
environmental problem of the highest priority. Another major source of pollution is the
Tingzi tributary. Although small, the Tingzi stream has the highest concentration of
pollutants.
11.   Industry is the largest contributor to water pollution. About 50 industrial plants
located along the Chaoyang stream are responsible for about two thirds of the stream's
COD load in the tributary. The high pollution load of the Tingzi stream is mostly due to
industries. Due to rapid industrial development, the water quality of Tingzi, Chaoyang, and
Erkeng tributaries is expected to deteriorate even further. In the past, enforcement and
governmental commitment to keep the industries in check have been weak. But under this
project, the authorities have now committed to implementing an action plan (see Annex 4)
that imposes strict effluent guidelines for the polluting industries.
12.   Going beyond arresting further deterioration of the situation, the municipal
government has started to take major initiatives for improvement. It has recently
established an effective solid waste management system including a sanitary landfill. The
Guangxi Urban Environment Project would constitute the major part of the program to
improve sewerage: extension and repair of the sewerage and drainage network, especially
along the Chaoyang stream, clean-up of the lower reaches of the stream, establishment of a
primary sewage treatment plant, improvement of the nightsoil management system whose
service will be required for some time until fully separate sewerage system is in place. The
small area improvement program will extend the program to the tertiary level for focused
areas where the environmental deficiencies are particularly serious.



Annex 1
43                           Page 4 of 13
13.   The northeastern part of Nanning drains into the Zhupai creek and the Nanhu lake.
Being a more recent urban development, it has been provided with relatively good drains
which channel both storm water and waste water. But to protect both the lake and the
creek from further domestic and industrial sewage, Nanning Municipality (NM) plans to
build an interceptor that cuts across all the main drains and diverts dry weather flows to a
sewage treatment at Langdong (a secondary treatment plant with an initial capacity of
160,000 m3/day, funded under a bilateral loan). These works, separate from the Guangxi
Urban Environment Project, form an additional element of the municipality's ambitious
program to improve the environmental quality of the city.
14.   The municipal government has commissioned Beijing Municipal Engineering Design
and Research Institute (BMEDRI) to establish a Sewerage and Drainage Master Plan
(1995) and conduct feasibility studies of the above programs, focused on Chaoyang stream.
In addition, it obtained assistance from Canada and Australia for further refinement of the
feasibility studies and additional studies toward environmental master plan.
The Project
15.   The Nanning sewerage and drainage components of the project aims at improving
the quality and drainage of water in Nanning city, by resolving the urgent and high priority
deficiencies as well as establishing the basis for long-term improvement. The individual
components are described below:
(a) Clean-Up and Sewering of Lower 3.1 km of the Chaoyang stream (Total cost
$14.9 million): Interceptor sewers will be built along each bank of the last 3.1 km
section of the Chaoyang stream to collect wastewater that will otherwise be
discharged directly into the stream. Twin interceptors would be slightly more costly
to build than a single larger one, but would be easier to maintain. These
interceptors merge into a concrete culvert which is joined by another interceptor
(400 meters long) from Erkeng. To serve the entire Chaoyang catchment area, the
interceptors will have a diameter of 1500 mm and be made of pre-cast concrete and
rubber joints. Allowances were given for the fact that the interceptors will be ready
for use before the city makes a full transition to separate storm and sewerage
networks. An estimated 180,000 m3 of sludge on the stream bed, which is analyzed
to be heavily laden with the nitrogen and phosphorus, will be dredged and will be
disposed at a safe location. Retaining walls of the stream banks will be built,
repaired or modified for better flood and erosion management.
(b) Sewage and Storm Water Pumping Stations at Dakengkou (Total cost $5.5
million). A sewage pumping station to pump the sewage from the Chaoyang and
Erkeng stream interceptors into the conveyor system crossing the Yongjiang. The
initial pumping capacity is 240,000 m3/d with for future expansion to 480,000
m3/day to cater for the Erkeng stream and Xixiangtang. A separate pumping station
of 12 m3/s capacity to pump out the Chaoyang or reverse to pump the Yongjiang



Annex 1
44                          Page 5 of 13
water to replenish the Chaoyang. The sewage and storm water pumping stations
may be combined on one site if possible.
(c) A Conveyor Sewer (Total cost $ 8.5 million) carrying the sewage from the
Chaoyang interceptor to the new Jiangnan treatment plant. River crossing will be by
a twin pipe siphon designed for expansion into a three pipe system handling 480,000
m3/day of flow if required in the future. The wastewater is then carried by a 3.9 km
trunk sewer of a culvert design (dimensions 2.4 x 2.0 m) to reach Jiangnan. This
sewer will pick up wastewater for the Tingzi and Shuitang stream catchment areas
including that from the Nahong channel and the industries.
(d) A primarv wastewater treatment plant at Jiangnan (Total cost $24.1 million) to
treat sewage from the Chaoyang, Erkeng, Tingzi and Nahong basins. The initial
capacity is expected to be 180,000 m3/day of wastewater, that may be adjusted
during final design in 1998-99 according to detailed flow measurements and
estimation. The site and structural design will make provisions for future expansion
to as much as 960,000 m3/day capacity after year 2015, sufficient to cater to most of
the city's wastewater except that to be sent to the Langdong STP being built now.
The location of the plant is selected such that local industries can be conveniently
served and so that the treated effluent will have minimum impact on the city's water
supply. Some of the industrial wastewater pretreated to a certain standard but
below the standard for direct discharge into surface water would be allowed to be
connected to the city sewerage system.
(e) Sewer Rehabilitation. Extension and Maintenance (Total cost $ 21 million).
Construction and rehabilitation of sanitary sewers and storm drains in various areas
of the city, including construction of about 37 km of new sewers, separation of
existing combined sewers into sanitary or storm sewers taking into account flood
volume and self-cleaning ability. These works will be packaged in phases that can
be evaluated, designed, and implemented as annual programs focusing on specific
geographical areas. Works complementing the components listed above and in
areas of insufficient coverage will be given priority. The sewer maintenance tools
will cost about $2 million.
(f)   Improved Nightsoil Management (Total cost $ 1.6 million). Under this
subcomponent, 16 tanker trucks, and other vehicles and equipment will be acquired
to increase the improve the septic tank service quality; including increased cleaning
frequency of septic tanks and extended service coverage. Computers, office
equipment and work space will also be acquired and information management
systems established to improve the Environmental Sanitation Department's
management capability.
(g)   Institutional Strengthening (Total cost $ 2.5 million). Technical assistance,
training and equipment procurement to (i) increase the capacity of the Municipal
EPB as well as city project management ($ 0.8 million), and (ii) establish the



Annex 1
45                          Page 6 of 13
technical capacity and institutions for sewerage management ($1.7 million). A
particularly important activity for the EPB is the water quality monitoring of the
Yongjiang during the phased construction of the Jiangnan treatment plant.
Implementation Arrangements
16.   A detailed cost breakdown is shown in Tables 2 and 3. The financing of investments
and operations are discussed in Annex 3.
17.   The Chaoyang stream interceptors and the sewage pumping station at Dakengkou
will be the first items to be implemented. Institutional support will also begin in mid 1998
to help set up the sewerage company. A schedule for the preparation of bidding
documents, bid review and construction is detailed in the implementation plans presented in
Tables 4 and 5.
18.   Implementing Agencies. The main parties involved in the overall implementation
are:
Chaovang Stream Improvement Office, directly under the mayor, has been
responsible for planning of drainage and sewerage components described above and
will also manage their implementation in coordination with the Municipal
construction bureau. The facilities, after they are built, will be turned over to a new
independent sewerage organization, expected to be established by 1999.
Environmental Sanitation Department will manage the nightsoil component;
Environmental Protection Bureau will manage its own institutional development
component and assist in planning of industrial sewer connections to the new
sewerage system and monitoring of water quality;
Nanning Guangxi Urban Environment Project Management Office (PMO) will
oversee the overall project implementation. It will take part in the bidding and
contracting procedures, works supervision, consultancy and training management;
allocate investment budgets and coordinate disbursement ; monitor progress and
compile progress reports to the municipal government and the Bank through the
Regional PMO. The Consultants CMlPS & F from Australia are providing
implementation assistance.
Tianjin Construction Engineering Tendering Company (TCTC) has been retained as
procurement agent for works.

Annex 1

Economic Justification
19.   The project elements can be classified into three main groups in terms of their
impacts: (1) improving drainage of sewage and storm water from the built-up area of the
city; (2) conveying it to a location downstream of the city for discharge into Yongjiang; and
(3) treating the sewage at that location. The first group of components, improving drainage
of contaminated standing water, would help control the incidence of water born diseases
that could be assessed by inference from related studies. Other small components in
Nanning, improving nightsoil management and small area facilities, also serve the same
purposes. The improvements would give better sewerage and drainage for about 70% of
the city's residents.
20.   Estimated investment cost of these components are about Y 560 million in 1997
prices. Additional investment of about Y 100 million would be required to complement and
complete the improvements, by expanding and repairing tertiary sewers and household
connections. Cost of operating these facilities is projected to increase along with facilities,
to about Y 8 million a year in 2003, after which it would increase more slowly by about 3%
a year in real terms. The pumps would have to be replaced in about 7 years. Discounted by
12% a year over 30 years, these costs have a present value of Y 490 million.
21.   While it is generally reported that incidence of water-borne diseases is very high in
Nanning, specific estimates vary widely. Various public health reports estimate the
incidence to be higher than national average by up to 70%, most estimating around 35%
above. This compares with estimates for Guilin, which puts the incidence about 30% below
average. Since there is little apparent difference in hygienic practices of the population and
the water supply, the difference could be attributed mostly to the state of sewerage, better
than average in Guilin and worse that average in Nanning. It was not possible to obtain a
systematic epidemiological study providing further necessary information such as duration
of illnesses, specific channels of infection, comprehensive costs, etc. One can, however,
infer from the above incidence estimates some orders of magnitude of benefits as follows.
22.   The World Development Report 1993 shows that diarrheal diseases and hepatitis
were responsible for about 4.1 % of health burden in China, or about 6.5 disability-adjusted
life years (DALYs) per 1000 person-years. Assume that the above-mentioned broad
incidence estimates apply these particular disease groups: incidence of these diseases is 35%
higher in Nanning than the national average and 25% lower in Guilin. Assume that on
completion of the project, 80% of the gap would be bridged. In Nanning, in view of the
average personal income of about Y 6200 (including in-kind benefits), the production loss
and medical cost associated with a DALY would be at least Y 10,000. The growth of total
incomes in the area, taking into account population increase, has been over 20% a year
recently. For the purpose of benefit estimation, it was assumed to increase by 12% a year
for the first 10 years and 8% a year afterwards. Under these assumptions, present value of
reduced burden from diarrhea and hepatitis alone over the next 30 years would be about Y
550 million. Studies also attribute other illnesses that occur frequently in Nanning, such as



Annex 1
50                         Page ll of 13
cholera and respiratory membrane infections, to poor drainage. Including these, the PV of
total health benefit could be in the order of Y 1000 million.
23.   A survey of 144 households in areas near Chaoyang stream conducted during
project preparation found about 8% of residents complaining of various gastro-intestinal
and respiratory afflictions attributed to contaminated standing water and the stream. This
information may be used draw a crude inference on broader health impact besides diarrhea
and hepatitis reviewed above. Assume that: half of the complaints are indeed due to
wastewater; half again of this would be reduced by the improved sewerage; and each
incidence cost an average of Y 15 a day in lost production and medical cost. These lead to
an estimated present value of Y 1275 million.
24.   Orders of magnitude indicated by the above inference appear comparable to a recent
estimate that puts the net annual economic loss due to the lack of sewerage in India
between 2% to 5% of urban GDP ("India's Environment: Taking Stock of Plans, Programs,
and Priorities," 1996). This would be equivalent to about Y 150 and Y 375 million a year in
Nanning. As sanitary condition in Nanning is superior to an average Indian city, improved
sanitation would have a smaller marginal impact. Only a fifth of this, however, would still
yield a present value estimate of between Y 600 and Y 1000 million.
25.   In summary, the benefit-cost ratio of the sewer and septic tank improvements would
be between 1.2 and 2.6. This estimate captures major apparent benefits, but does not take
into account other benefits that are even harder to estimate. For one, removing the strong
smell of the Chaoyang water from the center of the city would obviously have beneficial
effects. In theory, these and other benefits would be captured by increases in land value.
There are about 100 ha of commercial and residential plots in the immediate vicinity of
Chaoyang stream and affected by the smell. Total estimated value of these plots, about Y 3
billion, indicates that land value increments due mainly to aesthetic reasons could be
considerable.
26.   A concrete benefit of evacuating the collected sewage downstream is saving a water
intake, 100,000 m3 capacity, located on Yongjiang downstream of the current discharge
point of Chaoyang and Erkeng streams. It is projected that the intake would have to be
closed by about 2002 if pollution continues to increase as at present. A replacement intake
is estimated to cost about Y 110 million, which would be equivalent to the present value of
Y 56 million. On the other hand, the present value of investment and operating costs
attributable to this sewage conveyance is estimated be about Y 48 million, justified by the
avoidance of the water intake closure alone.
27.   The capacity and level of treatment of the collected sewage have been determined
mainly as a constrained optimization problem - to maximize the water quality in the
Yongjiang within the resources available. The main trade-off is between having a small
amount of wastewater collected and treated to a high degree, or to maximize the volume to
collect and treat moderately, as discussed in this Annex and in Chapter 6, Sections A and B.

Performance Indicators
28.   Primary Indicators. The Chaoyang stream and Yongjiang will be regularly
inspected for improvements in water quality and is the main target of performance
monitoring. The prevailing water quality standards, i.e. the National Standards for Surface
Water GB 3838-88, provides the most direct measure of the project's impact. Since water
pollution is more acute in the dry season, water quality surveys should be conducted during
the months of November to April. Supplementary measurements (namely BOD, nitrogen,
suspended solids and total phosphorus levels) should also be monitored to track
intermediate progressions in water quality not observable under the classification system.
29.   Secondary indicators. These indicators provide more specific indications of
environmental quality such as BOD or phosphorus levels. Other secondary indicators
attempt to show the utilization of sanitation facilities. An example of this is the operating
rate for treatment plants, interceptors or solid waste and nightsoil management facilities.
Sewer discharge qualities are also instructive since they would reflect the effectiveness of
these facilities.
30.   Monitoring Locations. Various criteria are used in the selection of monitoring
locations so as to fully reveal the Project's impact. Firstly, sections of the Yongjiang river
systems that suffer from more severe pollution should be closely monitored. On this basis,
the following locations should give representative results:
(a)   the urban stretches of the Chaoyang stream,
(b)   the confluence of the Chaoyang stream and Yongjiang at Dakengkou,
The quality of the Chaoyang stream should eventually improve from its current sewage state
to a Class V rating. The Yongjiang should consistently be maintained at Class III rating
after year 2002.
31.   Secondly, locations are also selected based on physical changes to the environment
as a result of the Project. Two critical sites are:
(a)    downstream of the discharge from the new Jiangnan Wastewater Treatment
Plant (this plant discharges into the Yongjiang),
(b)   the intake area of the Lingtie Water Filtration Plant, located at the
downstream of the Yongjiang's urban stretch. This plant is one of the main
suppliers of treated water to Nanning.
32.   Nightsoil. This component aims to increase the frequency of septic tank
maintenance and expand the service network to cover new units. The volume of nightsoil
and the number of new customers served would be appropriate impact indicators.

Sewerage and Solid Waste Management in Guilin
Background
I .    Guilin is one of south-central China's most important tourist destinations because of
the Lijiang, a scenic river which meanders its way through the city and onward to a unique
limestone landscape. The economy is growing rapidly because of tourist revenue and the
successful agricultural sector. The river is important to the city's thriving tourist trade as
well as for irrigation and municipal water supply. The scarcity of water is gradually
becoming evident and is especially acute during the dry season (80 percent of the annual
rainfall occurs in the 6 months between March and August). Therefore, while its economic
prospects are bright, Guilin also faces some very serious environmental challenges in the
near future.
Description of Problem
2.    The principal receiving water body is the Lijiang which currently meets Class II
standards. But persistent discharge of sewage is threatening to degrade existing water
quality. Furthermore the Lijiang's water level has been decreasing steadily over the years,
which also lessens its dilution capacity. Naturally, this condition is even more severe during
the dry season when dilution capacity falls even lower. Tributaries and major lakes in Guilin
city are already in the Class III category during the dry periods. Two of the most seriously
polluted tributaries are the Xiaodongjiang and the Taohuajiang, flowing through the eastern
and western parts of the city respectively.
3.    This combination of conditions is also adverse to the tourist industry, and results in
losses of revenue. The low water level during the dry season impedes cruise boats from
navigating the Lijiang freely and the tourist business suffers a corresponding decline during
the dry season. Some negative comments on the general environmental situation around
Guilin is already circulating within tourism circles.
4.    The second problem associated with the period of low flow is water supply. This is
perhaps more serious a problem than poor sewage and waste management. Guilin depends
solely on the Lijiang for its water supply. Fortunately, unlike Nanning most of it is taken
from upstream of most sewer and treatment plant outfalls. In terms of access to safe
drinking water, it is vulnerable mostly to pollution from tributaries coming from further
upstream (such as the Taohuajiang). The Lijiang Replenishment Component is developed
to deal with this problem and is discussed at length in Annex 6. This is a long term plan to
deal with water scarcity and sustain the city's growth and development.
5.    With a population of approximately 500,000, Guilin is currently producing about 0.8
kg per day of solid waste per capita and the rate is increasing every year by 7.5 - 10 %.



Annex 2
54                            Page 2 of 15
This will result in a solid waste stream of 1200 tons per day by the year 2010. Current
disposal practices are insufficient in protecting Guilin's environment. Uncontrolled disposal
of solid waste leads to contaminated groundwater, contributing to the Lijiang's
deterioration. Solid waste management in Guilin is under the jurisdiction of the
Environmental Sanitation Management Bureau (ESM1B) whose responsibilities include
street cleaning, solid waste collection, nightsoil management, the provision and maintenance
of public toilets as well as transport and disposal of wastes in an environmentally
acceptable manner.
6.    Solid waste management is therefore another emerging crisis. Currently, the only
disposal point is the city's Pingshan Composting Plant. This plant receives all of Guilin's
solid wastes, currently some 500 tons/day, and produces approximately 200 tons/day of
"compost" used by local farmers. The balance of the waste remains on site with the facility
rapidly filling up. Estimates of its remaining life differ but it is thought to be less than one
year if the site is not better managed. As it is, there is already an excessive stockpile of
waste (roughly 10,000 m3) at the plant and the absence of refuse manipulation or aeration
has turned the facility into a virtual dumpsite. Conditions are potentially damaging to the
environment, not to mention the effect on ground and surface water.
Main Causes of Pollution
7.    The pollution of Guilin's watercourses are attributed to low flow conditions,
inefficient use of sewage treatment capacity, industrial pollution and uncontrolled solid
waste disposal. The rainfall pattern for Guilin is characterized by short periods of high
rainfall followed by many months of relatively dry periods during which the water quality
suffers significantly. Water levels in the Lijiang has also deteriorated steadily over the years
due to overuse and inadequate water management. In addition, only one fourth of the city's
wastewater treatment capacity is in use because of inadequate sewering.
8.    Inadequate sewering has also caused pollution to the Three Lakes of Guilin: the Gui,
Sha and Rong lakes located near central Guilin. The shores of these lakes are lined with
many hotels and recreational locations and is part of the reason for Guilin's popularity as a
tourist destination. Due to the uncontrolled discharge of sewage and other wastewater into
the lakes, however, the water quality has begun to deteriorate to Class V.
9.    The four catchment areas of Guilin - namely, the Northern; Eastern; Qintan; and
Zhongnan, are served by four sewage treatment plants (STPs). In terms of capacity
utilization, the smallest plant is being overloaded (the Northwestern plant, which operates at
5000 m3/d compared to its design rate of 3500 m3/d), while the Eastern plant because of
limited sewer connections is operating at only half its 40,000 m3/d design capacity. The
Southern (35,000 m3/d) and No. 4 (100,000 m3/d) plants serve both the Qintan and
Zhongnan districts and are located at the same site. The No. 4 plant has recently been
commissioned while the Southern plant is temporarily shutdown for maintenance. Flows to
these plants are only about one fourth of design capacity.

Page 3 of 15
10.   Therefore, even though there seems to be sufficient treatment capacity for the city as
a whole, water quality continues to suffer because of insufficient sewers and conveyance
systems to efficiently utilize this capacity. Much of the wastewater in these catchments end
up in the natural watercourse. There are combined sewers in the center of the city but
mostly, the city does have separate storm and sanitary sewers. It is clear that the greatest
current need is to provide additional sewers and larger mains so that flows to the treatment
plants can be increased. After in-depth study, the Guilin City Environmental Master Plan
(1997) has recommended that it is more efficient to increase the treatment capacity in the
north instead of transferring sewage to the eastern and southern sewage treatment plants
(see Project Design and Least Cost Alternative). The Guangxi Environment Project is a key
instrument of the Master Plan's management strategy.

100,000 m3/day, oxidation ditch (No. 4 Plant)
Note:  Field inspection of the four treatment plants have found them to be in good shape but operating
well below capacity except the Northcentral plant. Total capability is approximately 179,000 m3/day but are
operated at approximately 70,000 m3/day. Although influent organic strength to the plants is somewhat
low, in the range of 40 to 150 mg/l of BOD, the effluent is only 10 mg/l or less.
l1.   Lingui county is located just outside Guilin city, comprising of urban and industrial
developments and equipped with only primary sewers. Lingui is another cause of pollution
problems in Guilin and its impact comes from the Xicheng district. This rapidly developing
district is drained primarily by the Luoqing River (a separate river basin from the Lijiang).
The eastern part of Xicheng however still drains into the Qintan area. There is only a main
trunk sewer in place but no sewer connections or treatment plants nearby. The inadequate
sewerage facilities therefore ultimately impacts the Lijiang.
12.   The Northeastern and the Qintan catchment areas are also a focus of this project
because they presently lack the means to treat locally generated wastewater. Although
these are not the most heavily populated parts of the city, there are already plans for future
development and wastewater loads are anticipated to be high. At the present moment, there
is not even a trunk sewer system in the Northeast while Qintan has a dependent sewerage
system linked to Zhongnan. The nearest sewage treatment plants that they can be linked to
are the Northcentral plant (for the Northeastern catchment) and the Southern and No. 4
plants (for the Qintan catchment).

Component Objectives
13.   Given the underutilization of treatment facilities, one of the most cost effective
means of improving Guilin's water quality is to increase the number of connections to trunk
sewers, where they exist, and to expand the network with secondary sewers to cope with
major polluting sources such as the industries and the densely populated city center. The
objective will be to raise the water quality of the Lijiang to meet Class II throughout the
year and for the Taohuajiang tributary to meet Class IV.
14.   Given their location in the city center and their potential contribution towards
tourism, the three lakes of Rong, Sha and Gui are also to be cleaned up. Interceptors and
sewers will be built to maintain the lakes at least Class III quality.
15.   To provide the necessary institutional capacity for continuous improvement, there
will also be technical assistance to strengthen policies, regulations and enforcement
capability. This includes pollution monitoring and wastewater management.
16.   The Project's objective for solid waste management is to provide a feasible long
term solution for Guilin. The ESMB has plans to improve the Pingshan Composting Plant
to process an additional 100 tons/day over the present 500 tons/day. Of this, 300 tons/day
will become compost and remaining waste will be transshipped to a new landfill at
Chongkou. To cope with a future generation rate exceeding 600 tons/day, ESMB plans to
have new transfer stations and more transfer vehicles. Under this Project, support will be
given to build the new landfill, one transfer station and the acquisition of some new trucks.
Description of Component Elements
17.   The project will introduce new wastewater collection and treatment facilities, solid
waste management facilities as well as a technical assistance package. The total cost
including contingencies is Y 421.7 million (or $ 47.4 million). The entire project area
includes the main districts of Guilin city - such as Qintan, Northern and Northeastern, as
well as the outlying Xicheng district of Lingui county. Three aeration ponds will also be
constructed at Yangshuo, Xingping and Baisha.
18.   The various subcomponents are:
(a)   for the Qintan catchment area, a main sewer interceptor (about 6 km).
secondary sewers (about 6 km) and a pumping station (160,000 m3/day) will
be built. The intercepted wastewater will be sent to the existing Southern
and/or No. 4 sewage treatment plants. The pumping station will be located
at Mantoushan.
(Total cost $9.0 million)



Annex 2
56                           Page 5 of 15
(b)   for the Northeastern catchment area. primary and secondary sewers (about
I 1 km in total) as well as a pumping station (30.000 m3/day) will be built.
The wastewater will be intercepted mainly from urban developments along a
new 3.5 km access road in the Northeast and then sent to the existing
Northcentral sewage treatment plant via a new pumping station at Qingfeng.
The Northcentral treatment plant will be expanded to handle this additional
load (see c). The cost includes construction of the access road.
(Total cost $ 8.9 million)
(c)   for the Northcentral catchment area, the existing sewage treatment plant will
be expanded to handle 30.000 m3/day of wastewater. The present operating
capacity is 5000 m3/day and the additional capacity will cater for the future
demands of its own catchment as well as the Northeastern catchment area.
(Total cost $ 5.2 million)
(d)   cleaning and sewering of the Rong. Gui and Sha Lakes in the city centre. An
interceptor and 2 km of sewers will be built to collect the wastewater that is
currently being discharged directly into the lakes. The wastewater will be
lifted via pressure mains to join the existing Zhongnan sewer lines and
eventually to the Southern and/or No. 4 plants. An estimated 180,000 m3 of
sludge will be dredged up from the lakes as part of the cleanup.
(Total cost $ 4.3 million)
(e)   in Xicheng town, a new primary sewage treatment plant and 3 km of sewers
will be built. The treatment capacity required is expected to be about 20,000
m3/day but may be as high as 40,000 m3/day depending on future demand.
Scheduled to begin implementation only in the year 2000, this sewage
treatment plant is intended for the eastern part of Xicheng. Sewers funded
under the project will serve only the urban districts. Industries will be
expected to pretreat their effluent and to pay for any sewer extension and
connection expenses required to discharge into the main sewer. This is in
accordance with NEPA regulations for industrial discharge. On this basis, a
primary treatment plant has been found adequate for the near future (see
para 22).
(Total cost $ 5.3 million)
(f)   sewer maintenance equipment. Special equipment and materials will be
procured for cleaning and maintenance of the city's sewers.
(Total cost $ 2.0 million)

(g)   three aeration ponds in a neighbouring county. These facilities will meet the
growing wastewater handling needs for the three towns of Yangshuo,
Xingping and Baisha in Yangshuo county.
(Total cost $ 0.84 million)
(h)   Institutional Strengthening. Support will be given to establish an
autonomous Sewerage Company and to improve the monitoring capabilities
of the Municipal EPB, including analytical equipment for Lingui and
Yangshuo county EPBs. Details of the development program for the
Sewerage Company is found in Annex 3 and a list of equipment and training
programs for EPB strengthening is found in Annex 4.
(Total cost $ 1.8 million)
(h)   the solid waste management components total about Y 85 million (or $ 9.7
million) including contingencies. The major element is a sanitary landfill at
Chongkou, 20 km west of the city centre. The 43 hectare site will ultimately
accommodate 3 million mr of solid waste. The project will support the first
stage of development which creates 2 million m3 of capacity;
(Total cost $ 6.3 million)
(i)   additionally, there will be a solid waste transfer station. 17 sets of 20 rn3
compactors, 9 garbage disposal trucks of 5 ton capacity each and 4 nightsoil
trucks. The transfer station will be located five miles west of the city center.
(Total cost $3.4 million)

Project Design and Least Cost Alternative
20.   North and Northeastern Catchment Areas. To meet the future wastewater
treatment needs of these areas two options are available. The first is to convey the
wastewaters to the Southern and/or Eastern treatment plants, where surplus treatment
capacity exists, or secondly, to expand the existing Northcentral treatment plant. Due to
the great distance of conveyance required by the first option, the expansion of the existing
sewage treatment plant has been found more efficient. A careful study showed that, given
the available land, the existing plant (currently operating at 5000 m3/day) can be expanded
up to a maximum of 30,000 m3/day. Based on projected wastewater loads, this capacity
will be sufficient to cater for both the Northcentral as well as the Northeastern catchment
areas up to the year 2010.
21.   During the study, there were also attempts to consider the adjacent Balijie
catchment area (under Guilin Prefecture). To serve this other catchment area however
would require more land for the plant expansion than is currently available. The project
cost would be prohibitively high, involving either a new plant in the Northeast or a long
conveying line to divert sewage to the existing Eastern plant. It was decided instead to
support Balijie's development by commissioning a Sewerage Master Plan Study for the
area.
22.   Xicheng. Consultants for Lingui county had initially suggested constructing a
secondary treatment plant at Xicheng town but the investment and operating cost would
have been far above the users' affordability. Based on the understanding that pre-treatment
will be done by industries as per NEPA requirements, primary treatment capability has been
found sufficient. This project, including treatment plant and secondary sewers in urban
Lingui county, will only be executed at or around FY 2000. It was agreed during pre-
appraisal that Lingui county and Guilin city would decide on whether to consider additional
industrial and urban waste loads by the time of the Project's mid-point review.
23.   Chongkou Landfill. A careful assessment of the Pingshan Composting Plant
revealed that, even with proper engineering, the life of the site can only be extended by a
maximum of two years. Given that this is the city's only sanitary disposal site and that its
holding capacity is already depleting rapidly, there are few long-term options except to build
a new sanitary landfill.
24.   The proposed 43 ha Chongkou landfill site is located about 20 km from Guilin's city
center. This area is characterized by low hills and is basically low productive land
marginally used by local farmers. The Shanghai Municipal Design Institute (SMEDI) has
carried out a full feasibility study and a separate geological and hydrogeological study was
carried out by the Guangxi Geological Institute. Based on this work, as well as a thorough
review of other potential locations, the site near Chongkou village was found to be the most
suitable.



Annex 2
61                          PagelOofl5
25.   In addition, public participation and notification work has already been done with
compensation provided to farmers who had been using the land. The site will be developed
in two phases, with World Bank financing provided only for stage one, constituting 375 mu
and will accommodate approximately two million m3 of solid waste. The second phase will
accommodate approximately three million m3. Taken together, the site will provide for
Guilin's solid waste disposal needs for approximately 20 years.
26.   The basic design being proposed by SMEDI is similar to that used in other landfill
projects in China. This design utilizes a clay liner 0.7 to 1.0 m thick, leachate collection
using plastic pipes with holes, gas venting, a series of dams placed around the periphery to
contain both leachate and structurally support the fill, leachate collection pond and leachate
recirculation. Recirculation is accomplished via the use of five tanker trucks that will
spread the leachate throughout the landfill. Recirculation of leachate has proven to provide
enhanced and more rapid waste stabilization and considered state-of-the-art technology.
The same basic scheme has been proposed for the Yunnan Environment Project.
27.   Solid Waste Transfer Station and Trucks. The current neighborhood collection
service, though highly labor intensive, is still fairly efficient . Handcarts and tricycle carts
are used in the actual pick up and the waste is then consolidated in 15 local transfer stations
around the city. Five ton trucks then transport the waste directly from the transfer stations
to the Pingshan Composting Plant.
28.   However, the increasing volume of solid waste being handled each day demands that
the existing collection system be improved. More transfer trucks are required since the
considerable distance between transfer stations and the final disposal site (20 km from city
center) cannot be efficiently managed by handcarts and tricycles. Studies have determined
that the most cost effective expansion plan would be a medium size transfer station (300
tons/day capacity) and a larger fleet of transport vehicles.
Implementation Schedule
29.   The Qintan sewers, Mantoushan pumping station and the Chongkou landfill will be
the first to be implemented. The institutional support program will also begin by mid 1998
to assist in the setting up of a Guilin Sewerage Company. A detailed implementation plan,
including a schedule for the preparation of bidding documents and bid review is presented in
Tables 4 and 5.
30.   Implementation Agencies. The overall coordination of the Project would be
assumed by the Guangxi Urban Environment Project Management Office (GUEPO).
Municipal and district level project offices are also established to delegate responsibility for
individual components. The Regional office will monitor the progress of components being
implemented and submit regular progress reports to the Bank and Regional government.
31.   The main parties involved in the overall implementation are:



Annex 2
62                         Page 11 of 15
(a)   the Sewerage and Drainage Engineering Office under the Public Utilities and
Management Bureau of the Municipal goverment will be the main
implementing agency of the sewerage components. This office is currently
responsible for the operation and management of the existing four sewerage
treatment plants and other sewerage facilities. A newly created Guilin
Municipality Sewerage Company (GSC), expected to be established by the
end of 1998, will take over the sewerage investments when they are
completed.
(b)   Guilin Guangxi Urban Environment Project Management Office (PMO) will
oversee the overall project implementation. It will take part in the bidding
and contracting procedures, works supervision, consulItancy and training
management; allocate investment budgets and coordinate disbursement;
monitor progress and compile progress reports to the municipal government
and the Bank through the Regional PMO.
(c)   The Environmental Protection Bureau will manage its own institutional
development component.
(d)   The Guilin Environmental Sanitation Bureau will be implement the solid
waste components.
(e)   Tianjin Construction Engineering Tendering Company (TCTC) has been
retained as procurement agent for works.
(f)   the technical designer for the sewerage and wastewater treatment facilities is
the Central and Southern China Municipal Engineering Design & Research
Institute (CSCMEDRI). The design of the Chongkou landfill and the
transfer facilities are undertaken by the Shanghai Municipal Engineering
Design Institute (SMEDI). Technical designers will be required to provide
technical specifications and bill of quantity to the bidding agent.

Monitoring Indicators
32.   Primary Indicators.  The primary project objective is to improve the water quality
of the Lijiang and its tributaries in Guilin. The prevailing standards for water quality, ie the
National Standards for Surface Water GB 3838-88, provides the most direct measure of the
project's impact. Since water pollution is more acute in the dry season, water quality
surveys should be conducted during the months of November to April. Supplementary
measurements (namely BOD, nitrogen, suspended solids and total phosphorus levels)
should also be monitored to track intermediate progressions in water quality not observable
under the classification system.
33.   Secondary indicators. These indicators provide more specific indications of
environmental quality such as BOD or phosphorus levels. Other secondary indicators
attempt to show the utilization of sanitation facilities. An example of this is the operating
rate for treatment plants, interceptors and solid waste management facilities. Sewer
discharge qualities are also instructive since they would reflect the effectiveness of these
facilities.
34.   Monitoring Locations. Various criteria are used in the selection of monitoring
locations so as to fully reveal the Project's impact. Firstly, sections of the Lijiang river
systems that suffer from more severe pollution should be closely monitored. On this basis,
the following locations should give representative results
(a)   the urban stretches of the Lijiang,
(b)   the Taohuajiang tributary and the Rong, Sha and Gui lakes.
The Lijiang will maintain a Class II rating throughout the year, including the dry season.
The Taohuangjiang tributary will also eventually be upgraded to Class IV.

36.       The running and design of the new  Chongkou landfill is critical given that
consolidation of solid waste, unless properly managed, can itself become a source of ground
and surface water contamination. One important area to monitor is the site's treatment and
discharge of recycled leachate. The ultimate leachate discharge must be checked for its
percentage of solids and BOD level. Monitoring sites for underground and surface water
locations will be determined during project appraisal.

Sewerage in Nanning and Guilin:
Institutional Development and Financial Plans
Part A.      Institutional Development Plan
1.    Introduction. Large planned increases in sewerage facilities in Nanning requires
development of a competent organization to operate and maintain the facilities from a weak
current capacity. In Guilin, the municipal government decided that a new institutional
structure and stronger financial and management systems are required to manage the
already extensive and growing sewerage service. Activities to develop these new
institutions will be an essential part of the project and supported under it.
2.    The municipal governments have prepared initial plans for the institutional
development, discussed them with the Bank, and have started implementing them. These
plans are evolving documents. The current versions (available in the Project Files) lay out
certain specific steps for 1997 and 1998, outline tentative plans for the future activities, and
direct.ons for preparation of more detailed plans through internal deliberations and
consultant assistance. Consultants have been assisting the municipal government in
elaboration of the plans, and terms of reference for future efforts. The Annex summarizes
the initial plans, focusing on the essential elements of the institutional development goals,
priorities by city and period, and overall directions for institutional development as well as
for later refinement of the plans.
3.    The institutional development plans consist of the following common elements,
though emphases differ between the two cities as discussed next:
a) Legal requirements for incorporation including drafting of the statutes, company
registration, appointment of the board, and valuation of assets;
b) Design of an organizational structure;
c) Appointment of management team and staffing plan;
d) Establishment of financial accounting and management systems and management
information systems;
e) Development of operational policies and procedures;
f) Preparation and approval of financial projections, plans, and budgets;
g) Definition of technical assistance and training programs.
4.    Priorities for Guilin. Before more detailed discussion of some of the above
elements, it is important to note major differences in background and in institutional

development requirements in the two cities. In the case of Guilin, sewerage operations have
received serious attention and investment since the late 1 970s due to the importance of
water quality to tourism. As a result, the Drainage Division has accumulated considerable
experience and capacity in sewerage management over two decades of sewerage operation.
Given these capacities as well as the large scale of operations and finance, Guilin
Municipality has decided to incorporate an autonomous Sewerage Company as an
independent legal entity and transfer assets, functions, and staff of the current Drainage
Division along with the full claim on sewerage tariff revenues.
5.    Development of a new accounting system and corporate financial planning and
management skills, which were irrelevant to a government division, would be the major
focus of institutional development activities in Guilin. Clear definition of corporate
structure and accountability would be another requirement that would benefit from high
level external advice and the senior managers' observation of other systems. Initial steps for
these areas of institutional development would take place alongside incorporation steps and
continue on after incorporation. Development of technical skills and operational procedures
would be in the nature of making the current practices more systematic and incremental
improvements especially in operational diagnoses and routine maintenance. The technical
systems development efforts would be scheduled after the basic structures are put in place.
6.    Priorities for Nanning. Currently Nanning has little separate sewerage system,
rnixed in with the substantial storm water drainage system managed, mainly on emergency
basis, by the Municipal Drainage Division. The system is expanding rapidly, however, as a
part of an on-going new development in the Langdong area and the planned upgrading of
existing urban areas particularly around Chaoyang Stream., planned and managed by
special-purpose agencies, Langdong Area Development Office and Chaoyang Stream
Improvement Office, reporting directly to the mayor. Most of the sewerage and drainage
construction financed under the project would be managed by the latter. These special
offices, however, are not suitable for sustained operation and maintenance of the sewerage
facilities. Therefore Nanning Municipality decided to establish a permanent institution,
probably in the form of an independent Drainage and Sewerage Company similar to
Guilin's. The institutional form is, however, subject to further review.
7.    As the existing technical and managerial capacity is far inadequate for the assets that
the institution would take over, development of basic operating procedures and systems
presents the most pressing task. Although all areas of institutional development have to be
attended to, the most urgent tasks would be recruitment and training of the core staff, and
development of basic technical skills and operational procedures. These would be the focus
of technical assistance and training during the pre-operational phase of 1998 and 1999.
Also during this phase, Nanning would have time to design an appropriate institutional
framework, develop a detailed program of staffing, systems development and training,
which will replace the current draft plan for the subsequent periods. The Company would
be formally incorporated after basic systems are developed, core staff is in place, and a more
detailed institutional development plan for subsequent periods is prepared. The current
target is for the Company to start operations by the end of 1999. Current target dates for

8.     Institutional Framework. A status as a legally independent company rather than a
government division would confer the following advantages:
 clear accounting of long-term costs by use of the enterprise accounting system instead
of the government budgetary system;
*  Flexibility in staffing, remuneration, and financial planning;
*  Accountability for own profits and losses, providing incentives for better performance;
*  Authority to raise financing in the form of borrowing and equity infusion.
9.     In order to realize these advantages fully, it is important to have a clear definition of:
the Company's responsibility in terms of scope and quality of services; the role of the
Company and the basis for adjustment of tariffs; the role of the municipal government in
supervising the Company's performance and setting of the tariffs. The current draft statutes
for the Companies provide for some of these, but many details are not specified. It is not
essential that these aspects are fully defined in detail at this time as the municipality will be
the sole owner of the Company for the time being and hence will exercise full control over



70                             Annex 3
Page 4 of 19
the Company through its board that it will appoint. Nevertheless, it is necessary that these
roles, responsibilities, and rights are defined in the form of operating regulations or a
contract between the municipality and the Company as soon as possible.
10.   Operational Mandates and Programs. As one of the first steps of institutional
development planning, technical operation and management procedures need to be drafted,
including an establishment of basic service targets and an estimation of volume of physical
and managerial work. These will be used as input to organizational and staffing plans as
well as preliminary budgeting. Also, with the help of consultants, these preliminary drafts
would be developed into written corporate policies and various organizational and
operational instructions.
11.   Initially operational planning and standards would have to focus on ensuring careful
inspection and satisfactory operation of new facilities to be completed and handed over
during the project. At a later stage, the target would be to improve the efficiency of the
entire operation. It will be necessary to prepare a comprehensive asset registers, including
separate valuation of drainage and sewerage facilities, for use in developing detailed
operation and maintenance plans. Finally, the municipality and the Company would need to
agree on and plan the schedule and scope of transfer of investment planning and
implementation responsibilities.
12.   Organizational Structure and Staffing. The current draft organizational structure
for Nanning and Guilin provide for: the Company board consisting of five to seven
members; a Managing Director (in Nanning) or a General Manager (in Guilin); and three
deputy directors responsible for operations and maintenance; for finance, accounting and
administration; and for planning, design and construction of major works, depending upon
the decision on the scope and timing of transfer of this responsibility from the municipal
government. As a first step in institutional development, each municipal government has
appointed a core management team to carry out the following activities:
* Preparing and implementing the institutional development plan including
recruitment of consultants for the initial phase of technical assistance;
* Management of the incorporation process;
* Drafting the financial forecasts and budgets;
* Setting up a preliminary accounting system;
* Selecting and recruiting of additional staff for the new company.
13.   In the case of Nanning, a preliminary staffing plan for the entire sewerage operation
and financial management, including staff profiles and remuneration scales, are being
prepared so that initial recruitment and training may begin well before the transfer of new



Annex 3
71                           Page5 ofl9
sewerage facilities. These will be based on preliminary operational requirement analysis
described above. In the case of Guilin, the additional staffing need is expected to be
relatively small in the immediate period around the time of incorporation other than financial
management areas. Complete staffing profiles will be developed after incorporation.
14.   Financial Policies and Systems. Even in Guilin, considerable efforts would be
required for developing adequate financial management systems. The system would include
the following elements each of which requires substantial expertise to design and substantial
staff to operate:
* enterprise accounting system with special attention to detailed cost accounting and
analysis;
* financial projection, planning and reporting procedures and systems to process the
information from the basic accounts to provide managers with information to support
management control and planning;
* procedures for financial transactions and their control;
- billing and collection system linked with customer register (or user database);
15.   Management Information Systems need to be designed that specifies the types and
forms of information to be provided to and from different levels and departments; the
procedures; and include the equipment and means of producing and conveying the
information. These will combine financial information along with operational information.
At a detailed level, for example, the user data base would include both the service
characteristics and billing information by customer or area. At the management level,
summary and exception reports on various aspects of finance and operation will be needed
to monitor and plan the sewerage operation.
16.   Technical Assistance. The project will support technical assistance, training, and
procurement of computer and office equipment required for institutional development. The
technical assistance will be provided by international and national experts in engineering,
financial, and management aspects of sewerage operation to assist in review of existing
systems, design of improved systems, planning of training programs and initial training of
trainers. Major part of the consultant assistance would be provided in early stages, and the
later stage consultant assistance would be provided by selected members of the consultant
team to review the efficacy of the systems and plans established earlier, make adjustments,
and provide follow-up training. The company's long term institutional development and
training needs should be periodically assessed and suitable programs developed.
Requirement of further systems development and staff and managerial training will be
identified in detail at a later part of each phase. Terms of reference will be prepared by
elaborating the foregoing discussions, incorporating specific tasks and schedules determined
through the on-going deliberation by the municipal provisional management teams. The
TOR will specify the activities during the initial two years in detail and outline later phase

work.
17.   Although the levels and emphases for technical assistance would be different
between the two cities, the institutional development in both cities involve a large
overlapping set of common elements, requiring essentially the same range of expertise.
Therefore, the consultant assistance for the two cities would be combined into common
packages, with clear allocation of efforts and costs to the two cities. On the other hand,
experience on other projects shows that it is difficult to obtain an efficient combination of a
large number of national and international consultants; and sometimes it has been difficult to
identify national consulting institutions experienced in both technical and managerial fields.
Given these considerations, the consultants may be recruited in two packages, one for
international consultants another for national consultants. The bidders would be allowed to
bid either for technical tasks or for financial and institutional tasks or both. The indicative
level of consultant input and estimated costs are shown by broad group of expertise, by city,
and by national and international level are shown in Table A3.2.
18.   Training Programs. Linked with the systems development activities helped by the
consultants, a systematic training would be an essential means of strengthening the staff
capacity of the sewerage institutions. The training program will serve either: to enable the
staff to understand and apply improved systems or new equipment; or to help managers
guide the design, implementation, operation, and evaluation of the improved systems; or to
establish or strengthen in-house training capabilities required to sustain and enhance
improvements introduced. During the initial phase, most urgent training requirements
would be covered: essential operational skills and procedures in the case of Nanning, and
financial accounting and management reporting procedures in the case of Guilin. During
the follow-up phase, in-depth training will be provided in improved procedures and systems
designed with the consultant assistance.
19.   Types of Training and Trainees. All managers and staff of the sewerage
companies would be required to receive appropriate training. It is important that levels,
methods, and goals of training activities suit different needs of trainees and subjects.
Training can be classified as follows according to the levels of training required for different
users:
* Introductory Training: to enable general users and managers to gain basic understanding
of essential elements of sewerage operations or related procedures.
* Intermediate or Specialized Training: to enable operators or specialists responsible for
specific tasks, to use new systems and up-to-date skills to the full extent.
* Advanced Training: to enable a limited number of high-level specialists to manage
complex technical functions, solve technical problems, train others through in-house
workshops or on the job, and to update and modify systems with limited help.
* Observation and Seminars. To enable high-level specialists, managers, and policy

makers to learn of different practices and techniques used elsewhere and to help them
set directions for systems improvement.
20.   Venues and Methods. Training venues and methods, listed below, will be chosen
on the basis of cost-effectiveness:
*  In-House Training: Seminars, workshops, classes, and on-the-job training held within
the sewerage institutions should be the main mode of training especially for introductory
and intermediate training. The training will be provided by own staff and consultants.
International experts participating in technical assistance for systems improvement or
those brought in specially for training should be required to train national consultants
and senior in-house staff on the technical rationale and application of new or improved
techniques and systems. The latter would in turn train other staff and managers.
*  Formal Training: For well-established and commonly used skills and knowledge, it
would be cost-effective to enroll the staff in courses offered by formal training
institutions or send them for on-the-job training in sector agencies. Staff will be sent to
training institutions for introductory training in some general skills including basic
computer use and quantitative methods; for more advanced courses in sanitary
engineering, accounting, financial analysis, work programming, general management,
etc. Sewerage companies or divisions in major cities in China with extensive and
successful experience would provide good training opportunities. Three major
municipalities of China, due to both their educational institutions and sewerage
operations, present themselves as suitable venues. Sewage treatment plants in Guilin
could offer effective on-the-job training opportunities for staff to work in Nanning's new
STPs.
*  Study Tours and Seminars: Some of these should be organized to familiarize selected
specialist staff and managers with the application of new systems and procedures in
other technical institutions and sewerage organizations. Selected managers, specialists,
and policy makers may also conduct observation tours before starting a new phase of
systems development so that they would be able to plan and manage the development
activities.
21.   Table A3 3 below shows a sample mix of various training programs that can be
carried out both in Nanning and Guilin.

Part B.         Financial Projections and Plans
1.     Operation and maintenance of drainage and sewerage facilities as well as investment
in Nanning and Guilin have in the past relied primarily on municipal government's annual
budgetary allocations, drawn mostly from Urban Maintenance and Construction Tax
revenues and, in the case of Guilin, tourism revenues and upper level government subsidies.
With the growing constraints on general revenues on the one hand and increasing scales of
sewerage operations on the other, the old financing system is no longer feasible nor
sustainable.
2.      Also clearly defined revenue basis and financial responsibility would be essential to
ensuring accountability of the independent sewerage institutions to be established in both
cities. It has been agreed that in both cities, the sewerage institutions should be required to,
and given sufficient revenue base to, cover without subsidy: all cash operating and
maintenance expenses as well as expenditures for renewal and replacement beyond those
financed under the proposed project; and debt service. Details of these financial targets
vary slightly between the two cities and described later in this Annex. It has also been
agreed that these expenditures would be met with revenues of sewerage tariffs collected
from all water users (based on China's "polluter pays" principle rather than on the basis of
benefits received) and drainage service payments received from the municipal government.
The sewerage and water charges of the recent past as well as projected sewerage charges
required to meet the above financial targets are shown in Table B. 1 below.

3.     The cost of sewerage investments under the project adds up to about Y 704.8
million (current prices). Financing would be provided in equal amounts from Nanning (Y
352.4 million) and the IBRD Loan/ IDA Credit (estimated at $42.5 million in constant
prices). In addition, a French bilateral loan has been obtained for construction of the
Landing STP. The repayment obligation for the bilateral loan from France for the
Langdong treatment plant would be about Y 6 million a year for 5 years starting in 1999.
The World Bank loan and credit borrowed by the municipality The cost for supporting
facilities are financed fully by the municipality.
4.     A review of the financial resources available to the municipality concluded that there
will be sufficient resources to support the sewerage project. The amounts of government
funds invested from 1998 to 2003 are shown in the Financing Plan in Table B.2. The
financial projections are shown in Tables 7a and b.

significantly to finance not only the operating and maintenance expenses, which are low due
to the small stock of facilities, but also raise a part of investment funds. The financial
projections (Tables 7a and b) show that with relatively moderate increases, the sewerage
charges would generate revenue sufficient to cover O&M as well as all debt service. The
tariff revenues, collected by the water company, will be retained and used by the municipal
government for the time being. When the Nanning Sewerage Company starts operation in
year 2000, only a part of the sewerage tariff base will be transferred to the Company along
with the debt service obligations and facilities turned over for its operation and
maintenance. The entire sewerage charge revenue base will be transferred to the Company
only when full debt service payments start, from 2003.

6.        The cost of sewerage investments under consideration here totals to about Y 242.6
million. Financing would be provided in equal amounts from Guilin (Y 121.3 million) and
the IBRD Loan/ IDA Credit (estimated at $14.5 in constant prices). A review of municipal
financial resources have concluded that there will be sufficient financing available for
counterpart funding from 1998 to 2003. The following are some available sources and the
maximum annual amounts available over the five year period. Sources of local counterpart
financing are shown below in Table B.3 and the overall financing plan in Table B.4.

7.        The financial situation is more constrained that in Nanning because of substantial
existing debts and the higher operating cost due to the scale of operation including some
secondary sewage treatment. Guilin municipal government currently has loans with a total
value of Y 73 million for its previous sewerage investments, some of them for short



Annex 3
79                              Page 13 of 19
maturities. The debt service payments average about Y 10 million a year. The World Bank
loan and credit would create a debt service burden that will increase during the project and
reach about Y 25 million a year by year 2004.
8.     Guilin municipal government has raised sewerage charges significantly during
project preparation. The revenues from the tariffs are expected to be barely enough to
cover the operating and maintenance expenses that are increasing fast due to increased
utilization of existing secondary STPs as well as the new facilities built under the project.
Therefore, the municipality has committed to raise the tariffs again by about 40% within
1998, as a condition of disbursement of the World Bank loan and credit. Guilin Sewerage
Company would be established as an autonomous company by the end of 1998, and take
over the entire revenues from the sewerage tariffs as well as drainage service payments from
the municipal government. Financial projections for the years 1996 to 2005 (Tables 8 a and
b) shows that even with significant further raises in the future, the revenues of the Company
are unlikely to cover all operating expenses, renewal expenditures, and all debt service. In
the interest of setting a feasible target to which to hold the Company accountable, it was
decided that the municipal government would continue to service the old debt and the
Company should take responsibility for all future obligations.
Financial and Institutional Indicators for Sewerage Companies
9.     The new Sewerage Companies in Nanning and Guilin should demonstrate attributes
of financial viability and have a continuous availability of funds for reinvestment. The
importance of these elements are most clearly demonstrated in the case of Nanning. Large
capital expenditures are expected and tariff revenues are destined for debt service and
operating expenses. Given the relative inexperience in operating a large sewerage network,
there is a risk of actual operating costs exceeding projections. Also, given the growing
demand for sanitation services, continuous investment (e.g. replacement capital) needs to
be anticipated beyond the project lifespan. A self sustaining Sewerage Company must be
able to sustain such routine expenditure. The following financial indicators will be used:

Assumptions Used for Financial Projections
1.    Revenue Forecast. As is the case at the moment, the financial projections assume
that the water companies will continue to collect these sewerage tariffs on behalf of the
sewerage companies and will charge a collection fee of 2.5% of amount collected in Guilin
and 1.5% in Nanning. A second source of revenue for the sewerage companies is the
payment from government for drainage operations. The annual transfer of drainage fees
from the government is estimated to be on average Y 4.5 million in Nanning and Y 2 million
in Guilin.
2.    Sewerage revenue is based on the usage of water sold by the water companies. In
Guilin, users of self-extracted groundwater is subject to sewerage charges just as regular
non-residential users are. In Nanning, this practice has not yet begun but is expected to
start in 1999, whereby users of self-extracted groundwater will pay the same sewerage
charges as non-residential users. However, the financial projections for Nanning allows for
collection efficiency from groundwater users to be initially poor. The percentage of
sewerage charges collected from groundwater users has been assumed to start at about 50
% in 1999, and gradually improve to 95% by year 2005.
3 .    The projected revenues is based on the above tariff schedule as well as the predicted
increase in water sales. The latter is expected to grow at a rate of 3 percent a year in
Nanning and 2 percent a year in Guilin. The Guilin Sewerage Company would also collect
a management fee for operating the Xicheng wastewater treatment plant from year 2003
onwards; the fee being equal to the cost of operating the plant. This entry is not shown in
the financial projections since the revenue will directly offset expenses.
4.    Operating Cost. All cost of operation and maintenance are assumed to be subject
to the following inflation rates:
Assumed Inflation Rates
Year          '97 (base)  1998  1999  2000  2001   2002 to 2005
Domestic Inflation Rate (%)  2.0    4.8   5.0   5.5   5.5       5.5
US Inflation Rate (%)      2.0    2.0   2.1   2.2   2.2         2.3
In estimating the cost of operation, historical data of the municipal wastewater and drainage
operations provided the basis for an initial estimate. The assumed cost of operation and
maintenance reflect improvements in operation and maintenance procedures, and higher
operation and maintenance cost as operating rates and treatment capacity increases.
Personnel expenditures were estimated in accordance with staffing requirements for the
sewerage companies and their increased levels of operation. They are based on base salary,
fringe benefits and include payments to retirees in accordance with local regulation.
Materials include provisions for chemicals, parts and the cost for operating vehicles. They



Annex 3
81                           Page 15 of 19
reflect the demand forecast for chemicals for the treatment facilities and the projected cost
of operating vehicles and specialized mobile operating and maintenance equipment.
Maintenance and Electricity costs were projected to increase with the size of operations.
Cost of administration covers general and administrative expenditures including provisions
for maintaining and operating office equipment, telecommunications equipment and
insurance coverage.
Depreciation was calculated at 2.9 per cent of gross fixed assets in operations, which
represents the average life of assets which were mostly sewers and drains. The initial asset
base, valued in 1997, are Y 506 million in Nanning (including the Langdong treatment
plant, valued at Y 179 million) and Y 102 million in Guilin. Upon commissioning new
facilities constructed under the proposed project were added to the asset base.
5.    Changes in working capital requirements cover the provision of adequate
inventories, the level of accounts receivable and accounts payable. Inventories were
estimated at one and a half months of supplies of chemicals and appropriate levels of spare
parts and replacement materials. Accounts receivable were forecast initially at about 2
months of sewerage revenue decreasing to about one and a half month by 1999. This
provision is adequate on the basis of past experience with payment of water bills. Doubtful
accounts were provisioned at 1/2% of accounts receivable. Accounts payable were assumed
to amount to about one month of utilities bills and a half a month of chemical cost. They
are assumed to increase slightly with the startup of the treatment plant and the expanded
pumping facilities. A minimum cash balance equivalent to one month of cash operating
expenses was maintained.

Industrial Pollution Control:
Institutions and Municipal Action Plans
Nanning
1.    The most serious industrial pollution problems center around waste water discharges
that are not in compliance with the discharge standards. Urban air pollution is not yet a
pressing problem as air quality meets Class II standards, however, due to the poor quality of
Guangxi coal (ash content from 30-40%, and sulfur from 4-5%), and as industrial activity
increases, urban air pollution will become more important'. Hazardous industrial waste
generation is low, due to the type of industries in Nanning.
2.    There are around 1000 industrial enterprises registered in Nanning City with a total
annual output value of around Rmb 3.2 billion (US$385 million); town and village
enterprises' represent around 10% of this total. Most of these enterprises are small scale
and have only a minor effect on pollution loads. There are some 68 medium and large scale
industrial enterprises which, based on a 1993 survey, represent a total waste water
discharge of around 95 million tons/yr containing COD of around 40,000 tons. Twenty nine
of these enterprises have average annual COD discharge concentrations above the general
discharge standard of 150 mg/l. The top 10 polluters discharge a major proportion of the
waste water and COD load, 79% and 82%, respectively. Of the top 10 polluters, five are in
the food industry (MSG, sugar, bean curd, canned food, and citric acid), three in light
industry (paper, and leather), and two in the chemical/pharmaceutical sector. The MSG
factory discharges into the heavily polluted Chaoyang Stream. Average annual COD
concentrations for these 10 polluters range from 200 (Nanning Chemical Company) to
4,250 mg/l (MSG Factory), with an overall average of 625 mg/l.
3.    The Nanning EPB Industrial Pollution Control Plan is available in the Project Files.
Nanning EPB is using a number of measures to control industrial waste water pollution and
to, ultimately, bring all industrial enterprises into compliance with the discharge standards.
It is recognized by the Municipality that many of the existing problems are due to failings in
the application of the Environmental Impact Assessment procedures for both new and
expansion projects, and subsequent environmental management of these projects (Three
Synchronizations). Administrative processes for approval of new and expansion projects
have been strengthened to better ensure that all municipal government entities involved
cooperate to try to ensure that environmental protection measures are implemented
effectively.
' Due to the high sulfur content of coal used, acid rain is already significant in
Guangxi. In Liuzhou, 50 km west of Guilin, the frequency of acid rain is close to
90% and minimum recorded pH values measured at 6 cities in the Region are in the
range 3. 1 to 3.5.

4.    To deal with existing polluters, the EPB will impose special fines or even closure if
agreed time bound action programs are not complied with. Such programs are already in
effect; in the case of the MSG Factory (the worst polluter in the Chaoyang Stream area) the
first phase of the mandatory action plan for waste water treatment commenced operation in
1996, and the final phase is to be completed by 2000. Measures are also being taken, that
will be supported under the project, to improve enforcement of the discharge standards by
more frequent and effective monitoring. To this end, Nanning EPB has increased its staff
by some 30% over the last few years to a total of 130; pollution levy fee collection at Rmb
14.5 million in 1995 showed a 30% increase over that in 1994, due in part to increased
enforcement efforts. Nanning has also begun to move to a discharge permit system (DPS)
where allowed discharge is based on pollutant mass flows rather than concentration. In the
longer term, as non-compliance problems with the major polluters are rectified, the DPS
will permit more effective control.
Guilin
5.    Due to the importance of tourism to the municipal economy, Guilin has, since the
1970's, pursued a very strict and active policy to control both industrial air and water
pollution. From 1979 to 1980 some 27 major polluting enterprises were forced to close or
change production. Closures included steel blast furnaces, paper pulp production, a
lead/zinc mine, and a coal burning power station. As part of this policy, new industrial
enterprises and expansion projects are very strictly controlled. In consequence, industrial
output value was essentially stagnant during the 1980's, although this has increased strongly
during the past five years to Rmb 4.0 billion in 1994 (US$ 480 million); an annual growth
rate during this period of 30%.
7.    Waste water discharge volumes have been relatively stable over the past ten years
whilst the pollutant load, measured by the COD content, has decreased by around 15% per
year over the period 1989 to 1994. Based on a detailed industry survey in 1994, Guilin EPB
estimates that 95% of total industrial waste water discharges and pollutant loads are
accounted for by sixty six enterprises - these also account for around 96% of industrial
output value. These discharge 29 million tons/yr of waste water with a COD of 4,700 tons.
The profile of the top ten polluters is very similar to Nanning: they comprise 3 5% of total
waste water discharged and 80% of the COD load, five of the top polluters are in the food
sector (bean curd, MSG, brewery, canned food, rice noodles), three in the
chemical/pharmaceutical sector (tires, pharmaceuticals), and two in light industry (pulp and
paper). The range of average annual COD concentrations for the top ten polluters is from
40 mg/l (in compliance) to 3600 mg/I, whilst the average for the top ten is 370 mg/l; 60%
of the comparable figure for Nanning.
8.    Control of coal use has been actively pursued since 1990. All domestic coal must
have a sulfur content of less than 1.0% and the domestic use of LPG (liquefied propane gas)
has been promoted such that this clean fuel is now estimated to supply 80% of cooking fuel
requirements within the city. For industry a levy charge was introduced in 1994 for SO2
emissions, there is also a program to enforce sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions that



Annex 4
88                             Page 3 of 5
require the use of high quality coal (1-2% sulfur), or closure. Ambient S02 levels are now
close to Class 1, and are about 10% of levels experienced during the 1980's.
9.    The Municipality (includes the city and two counties of Yangshuo, and Lingui) and
the Prefecture have actively enforced the EIA and Pollution Management Regulations. The
discharge permitting system was introduced in 1991 initially for water - one of the first
cities in China to use this system - and has since been extended to air, solid waste, and
noise. Some 380 industries in the municipality (100% of the heavy industries) and 273 in the
prefecture have received permits. In addition, many of the industries now discharge to
municipal waste water treatment plants. The major water polluters are under time bound
action programs to bring discharges into compliance by 2000, or face closure. Levy fee
collection increased by 70% from 1994 to 1995 to Rmb 6.2 million, however, much of this
increase was due to the extension of the levy system to include S02 (sulfur dioxide)
emissions. Although GM has been successful in curbing and then decreasing industrial
pollutant discharges, there is still scope for improving industrial environmental
performance. A major part of such improvement would rely on more timely and effective
monitoring of industrial emissions so that the advantages of the permitting system can be
realized.
Industrial Pollution Control Programs
10.   The Nanning EPB program for control of industrial waste water discharges (see
Project Files reference No. 18) in the Chaoyang Stream (18 enterprises) and Jiangnan (15
enterprises) areas would bring industries up to the applicable standards for discharge into
Class III water bodies. The program for control of industrial waste water discharges in the
Li River, tributaries and waste water treatment plants for Guilin (12 enterprises), and Guilin
Prefecture (13 enterprises) would bring all industries in the two areas up to the applicable
standards (different for direct discharge into river systems and discharge into sewers linked
to secondary treatment facilities).
11.   The Guilin program is a continuation of the well grounded strategy described above.
During the project period the following time bound action programs are due for completion:
a.    MSG and Soya Sauce Factories resulting in upgrading of water quality in the
Xiaodong River from Class V to III;
b.    Guilin Pharmaceutical Factory resulting in upgrading of water quality in the
Ningyuan River from Class V to III; and,
c.    Brewery and paper mill resulting in the upgrading of water quality in the
Nanxi River from Class V to irrigation quality.

Sugar Refinery Pollution Control
Background
1.    Sugar cane production and processing is widespread in Guangxi, except in the Northern
part where weather and soil are unsuitable for cane cultivation. The production has expanded
rapidly over the past ten years, so that in 1992 it exceeded Guangdong's which until then was the
largest producer in China, to 2.3 million tons in 1995, and is projected to reach 3.5 million tons
per year by 2000. The sugar refining industry, with 108 refineries, is the most important
economically in the Region. They generate around 10% of Guangxi's entire industrial output
value, a significant share of income and employement in the rural areas, indirectly through cane
production and as a direct employer, and a major share of local government revenues, in some
counties accounting for as much as 60% of tax revenues.
2.    Bank sector work' concerning sugar cane production and processing found that the
average cane mill size in China of 1200 tons/day, is small compared with other countries, ranging
from 3,200 tons/day (Cuba) to 7,100 tons/day (Thailand). It concluded nevertheless that the
Chinese processors compare favorably on competitiveness indices and costs with other major
sugar producing regions. In addition, it found that liberalization of the internal sugar market in
the period 1990-93 has led to essentially a free market, eliminating virtually all of the divergence
between prices inside China and the world market prices.
Sugar Industry Pollution
4.    The sugar industry is by far the biggest source of industrial waste water pollution in the
Region. It is estimated that in 1994 the annual waste water discharge was 230 million tons and
with a COD content of 0.4 million tons (an average COD concentration of 1760 mg/l),
comprising 25% and 76% of total Regional industrial discharges of waste water and COD,
respectively. The latter is nearly five times the estimated total COD discharge from all of Nanning
city. The pollution effect on surface waters is exacerbated as the cane harvesting and crushing
season (November to April) coincide with the dry season. Some 9 of the 28 major rivers in the
Region are subject to serious pollution from the sugar industry. Due to the pollution problems,
construction of new sugar refineries has not been permitted since 1993, although expansions have
been allowed. Under a recent State Council directive that mandates compliance with pollution
discharge standards within a few years, many sugar refineries in Guangxi face the choice between
significant investment to reduce the stillage and shutdown of operation.
5.    The Regional EPB carried out an extensive survey of the sugar industry in 1994 and
determined that few of the refineries have effective waste water treatment systems. The most
serious pollution problems are due to the processing of molasses, a by-product of sugar refining,
by fermentation into alcohol which generates high COD concentration waste water (molasses
l See 'China - Sugar Marketing and Processing Issues, 30 December, 1993 (Draft)'



92                                    Annex 5
Page 2 of 6
stillage). Of the 108 sugar mills, 96 have alcohol production, of which around 50 are considered
to be medium- to large scale, producing at least 30,000 litters per day of alcohol. Due to the
refractory nature of the dissolved organic compounds, and the high nutrient content (nitrogen,
potassium, phosphorous), the stillage is difficult to treat by conventional waste water treatment
methods, and although the use of lagoons is quite widespread, their effectiveness is very low.
Characteristics of the stillage are given below:
Table 1.

6.    Studies by the Regional EPB and the Sugar Industry Corporation, with the assistance of
local and international consultants, of treatment systems in use both within China and in other
sugar producing countries have demonstrated that environmentally effective and financially viable
stillage treatment systems are available. The systems include measures for waste minimization
and stillage treatment. They improve the efficiency of the molasses fermentation and distillation
process, and thereby reduce the amount of stillage produced and raise the conversion of molasses
to alcohol. The improved alcohol production processes can produce concentrated stillage that
can be economically further concentrated through evaporation and sold as a fertilizer. Officials of
the Guangxi Environmental Protection Bureau, Finance Bureau, Sugar Industry Corporation, and
one of the sugar plants carried out an investigation of such processes in India, visiting three sugar
mills, and determined that the waste minimization technology is mature and suitable for use under
Chinese conditions.
7.    Market and Policy Context. The preceeding discussions show that the sugar industry in
China, a large part of which is Guangxi, is internationally competitive but require serious actions
to control pollution. For both the economic and environmental reasons, GAR considers that
smaller alcohol work shops should probably close and sell their molasses to the medium and large
scale plants that can afford the investment in pollution abatement measures. It is estimated that
total investment required for pollution treatment systems for sugar industry in Guangxi is around
US$150 million. However, the investment is constrained by financial resources as well as risks.
The industry has only recently recovered from the severe floods of 1994 and the depressed
internal markets in 1995 arising from "solidarity" imports of sugar from Cuba. With competitive
market pressure, the priority in allocation of the limited domestic funds usually goes to
modernization and expansion projects. Pollution control investments are less able to compete for



Annex 5
93                               Page 3 of 6
the available financing not only for these financial reasons but also because the record of earlier
attempts have in general unfavorable and the loans for them often went unpaid. There is therefore
a need to support demonstration of the technologies that have proven successful elsewhere but
not yet adopted in China.
Project Description
8.    The project would finance the implementation of two or three subprojects to adopt
commercially proven waste minimization technology and stillage processing facilities for molasses
based alcohol workshops to bring these into compliance with waste water discharge standards.
The proposed Bank financed subloan would be limited to 100% of the foreign exchange costs for
goods and services, or 50% of total subproject costs, whichever is higher. It is expected that
these subloans will finance about 40% of total subproject costs. The remaining 60% of the cost
will be financed by the borrowing sugar enterprises, either from their internal cash or through
commercial borrowing. The subloan in foreign currency will be repayable in seven years including
two years' grace at the Bank's standard LIBOR-based variable rate plus 1.5% per annum.

9.    Appraisal Criteria: Technical. Five medium to large scale sugar mills that have alcohol
work-shops have made initial applications for pollution control subprojects with a total investment
of around US$18 million. Feasibility studies for these subprojects are under preparation. The
selection criteria and administrative arrangements are described below. The
environmental/technical appraisal would include (a) assessment of the subprojects consistency
with the Regional environmental strategy and its priority; (b) the impact on pollution prevention
and reduction; (c ) compliance with national/local environmental regulations including submission
and approval of environmental assessment report; and (d) efficiency of the implementation
program including a procurement plan (refer to paragraph 12 below). The appraisal would have
to demonstrate that all feasible options for pollution reduction using proven technologies have
been examined and that the solution proposed is the most cost effective.
10.   The financial appraisal would assess the financial viability of the enterprises and the
proposed investment, including the following eligibility criteria:
A minimum alcohol production capacity of 30,000 liters/day;
No losses incurred in more than one year over the three years prior to application, or
not more than two years over the last five;



94                                 Annex 5
Page 4 of 6
*  Financial projections to demonstrate sustained profitability over the project and
maintenance of a minimum debt service ratio (ratio of the sum of profit, depreciation,
and interest payment to all principal and interest payments) of 1.5 over the subloan
repayment period for all debt incurred, including those incurred under the project; and
* The borrowing enterprise pledge assets valued at least 1.5 times the subloan amount.
11.   Subloan Arrangements. The subloans and the supplemental local currency financing
will be administered by a Sugar Pollution Control Project Unit under the Regional PMO. The
Unit will consist of representatives of the Regional EPB, Regional Finance Bureau, Regional
Planning and Economic Commissions, and the Guangxi Sugar Corporation. A commercial bank
will be retained to perform financial appraisals of potential sub-borrowers such as assessment of
credit risk, and the financial acceptability of subprojects. The Unit will also retain technical
advisor(s) satisfactory to the Bank to carry out the technical appraisal of the subprojects. The
Unit will review the appraisal reports and make a final decision regarding the selection of the
subproject and loan amounts and terms. All subproject appraisal reports will be subject to the
World Bank's prior review and no objection to assure that feasibility reports are of acceptable
quality, appraisal criteria are fully applied, and subloan arrangements are consistent with agreed
conditions. Loan account administration would be the responsibility of the Regional Finance
Bureau. The Unit will evaluate the results of the subprojects carefully in order to incorporate the
lessons learnt into the Region's future sugar refinery pollution control plan.
12.   Procurement. Bank financing under the facility would be for goods and services only.
The procedures for procurement would be the same as those for other Bank industrial
environmental credit lines in China which the Bank has reviewed and found satisfactory.
Procurement of the waste minimization technology and any associated proprietary equipment
would be through ICB procedures, to ensure that all appropriate technology and technology
licensees are evaluated. Other contracts below US$1.0 million would be awarded through
National Shopping, after evaluation and comparison of quotations solicited from at least three
qualified suppliers. All contracts with an estimated value of US$0.5 million and above would be
subject to the Bank's prior review. Contracts with a value below US$ 0.5 million would be
subject to post-review by the Bank, and the Regional Finance Bureau would ensure that all
relevant documents are maintained in suitable records for this purpose. For all procurement, a
procurement plan will be a required part of the subproject proposal and appraisal report to be
submitted for the Bank's prior review. It is expected that the draft bidding documents that
requires the Bank's prior review would be submitted together with the subproject appraisal
report.
Monitoring
13.   Monitoring indicators for the subloan appraisal process (feasibility study commencement
to construction approval) and subsequent subproject implementation phases are shown in the
attached table. Completion monitoring, as detailed in the attached table, will compare project
results concerning waste water discharge with those projected at appraisal. In addition, at Project

Completion an update of the 1994 Regional EPB sugar industry pollution discharge survey will be
carried out to monitor overall progress, bring mills into compliance with discharge standards, and
to assess the contribution of the sublaons.

Annex 6
Regulation of the Lijiang
Background
1.    One of the main issues of national as well as local significance is the quantity and
quality of the water in the Lij iang, a major tourist attraction and source of revenues located
in the northeaster part of Guangxi. The scenic limestone formations along the river's
banks downstream of the Guilin is considered a top national treasure and attracts about a
million tourists a year. The existing tourist boats require a minimum flow of about 30 m3/s
to navigate this reach of the river. Larger flows make navigation easier and provide for a
more aesthetically pleasing trip.
2.    With a total length of 214 km and a drainage area of 6050 km2, the Lijiang is a
branch of the Zhu (Pearl) River system. The Lijiang Basin is in the rainy subtropical
monsoon climate zone, with average annual precipitation of about 2000 mm. At the Guilin
Gauging Station (2200 km2 catchment area, 1946-1985 period of record) the average
streamflow is about 128 m3/s, with extreme maximum and minimum recorded flow rates of
4250 m3/s and 3.8 m3/s, respectively. During the six month period from March through
August, flows average about 200 m3/s; from September through February average flows are
about 38 m3/s. The driest two months are December and January when flows average
about 24 m3/s.
3.    As the population and economic activities in the Lijiang valley have increased
during recent years, the water level of the river has decreased markedly, especially during
the dry season. At times, plying of the river by the tourist boats is severely hampered by
low water levels. The low waste assimilation capacity of the river causes further
deterioration of the river quality. When the rains do come, the negative impact on the river
is also severe because low flow conditions have been the norm for much of the year.
4.    All levels of the government have been considering water augmentation projects to
increase the level and improve the water quality of the river. The scheme proposed for the
project employs a canal from the existing Wulixia reservoir, improved management of the
catchment area and repairing some 46 km of embankment so that the river is able to
accommodate the increased flow. In addition, a mini-hydro project of 1.0 MW capacity
will be built. Areas along the Lijiang river and the upstream Wulixia reservoir will also be
reforested to reduce soil erosion, thereby checking silt buildup in the river and reservoir.
These sub-components, together with institutional development, will cost approximately
$24 million in investment, including contingencies. If not implemented, the loss in
revenue from decreased tourism will far exceed that cost.

98                            Page 2 of 11
Wulixia Water Supplement Sub-component
5.    Background. The Wulixia water supplement sub-project will provide supplemental
water to the Lijiang River from the existing Wulixia reservoir, in the upper Xiangjiang
basin. This reservoir was completed in 1994 and has an upstream catchment of about 340
square hectares. Its current functions are to provide irrigation, generate electricity and
supplement the Lijiang with 7 to 8 m3/s of flow during the dry season via a canal, thereby
guaranteeing a minimum flow of 30 m3/s flow during the dry season.
6.    Objective. The Wulixia subcomponent under this project will provide an additional
7.5 m3/s of replenishment water to the Lijiang, raising the Lijiang' s minimum flow to about
37.5 m3/s. The flow through Guilin city, after offtake by irrigation and other users, would
be between 3 5 to 3 7 m3/s, essentially guaranteeing at least 30 m3/s of flow for the tourist
route -- the minimum for boat navigation. This would increase the time period where there
is sufficient flow for tour boats to travel.
7.    Under the project, reservoir water would be conveyed to the Lijiang River through
the rehabilitation and extension of the existing irrigation canal. The proposed works would
line this canal (24.5 km) to reduce leaks, extend it (400m) and install a mini powerplant (2 x
0.5 MW power units) along the canal before the water is released into the Lijiang. The
existing dam has been determined to be safe against Probable Maximum Flood. The total
cost of this component, including contingencies is estimated to be Y 46 million ($5.3
million), including preparation works (cleaning, drainage and canal slope protection).
8.    While providing an additional 7.5 m3/s of replenishment during the dry season, the
scheme also ensures that present and future irrigation requirements are met. With good
water management at the reservoir and a minimum release of 8 m3/s, power generation at
the existing powerplant can be increased substantially from 12.5 million Kwh/year to 17.5
million Kwh/year. Canal lining would reduce water leaks and increase power generation by
2.4 million Kwh/year at the existing powerplant. The new mini-powerplant will add another
2.6 million Kwh/year, bringing the total amount of new energy due to this scheme to 5
million Kwh/year.
River Embankment Protection Sub-component
9.    Background. Sections of the embankment along the Lijiang has been badly
damaged due to flow erosion and abrasion, especially during the wet season. This is due
both to river traffic as well as heavy rains in the wet season, a six month period during
which 75% of the annual rainfall occurs (March to August). Most of the bank is made up
of primary sand, silt and clay terraces, which are susceptible to the effects of flow variation.
According to studies, up to 200,000 tons of earth is being washed away each year due to
poor embankment, causing the loss of farmland, trees and roads. In addition to loss of land,



Annex 6
99                           Page 3 of 11
it is believed that the transported sediments change the profile of the water course and result
in the formation of 'shallows', causing navigation problems in the dry season.
10.   A large rural population lives along the river, particularly between the city and the
river's middle reach. Consequently, land loss and erosion problems are important issues for
local groups. About 50 km of masonry currently exist along the east and west banks.
Apart from repairs on the existing walls, local authorities estimate that another 50 km will
be needed considering the increased flow due to the Wulixia subcomponent.
11.   Objective. Under the project, the effects of the wet season would be mitigated by
improving and extending the embankment walls and by implementing erosion control
measures. A total of 46 km of masonry walls will be repaired or built in two phases. World
Bank financing would be provided for the first phase and part of the second phase, building
a total of 14 to 16 km of embankment. Apart from the masonry walls, minor plantation will
be done along the bank to reduce soil erosion. The total cost of this sub-component is
limited to Y 63 million including contingencies.
12.   Technical Assistance. The consultancy will be used for river bank erosion and silt
deposition studies, and to improve the management of the embankment. This is included
under the Lijiang Co-ordination Commission technical assistance package shown in Table 3.
Soil and Water Conservation Sub-component
13.   To reinforce the benefits of water replenishment and embankment works, a
plantation program will be implemented in two associated areas of the Lijiang. The new
vegetation will increase forest cover and improve the ground's water retention, helping to
maintain the river's water level. The two areas are (a) areas around the Wulixia reservoir;
(b) areas along the Lijiang stretching from Guilin City to Yangshuo. As some of these areas
will be planted with bamboo and gingkoes, additional economic benefits will accrue to the
local community. There is a strong local demand for these forest products and a mature
bamboo plant currently commands a market price of Y 10-13 each.
14.   Being a source of replenishment for the Lijiang, the Wulixia reservoir needs to
maintain a healthy inventory of water during the dry season. Erosion and the accumulation
of silt, however, has become quite severe and has reduced the actual capacity of the
reservoir. Depending on the kind of vegetation on the ground, water retention can also be
increased by 15 to 25%.
15.   Under the soil and water conservation sub-component, two areas will undergo
plantation programs: (a) at the Wulixia reservoir, and (b) stretches along the Lijiang river.
The first area covers 8534 hectares of land around the reservoir, with 700 hectares to be
planted with bamboo and gingko plants. The remaining will be earmarked for reforestation
by controlling human access and the introduction of protection measures to enhance natural



Annex 6
100                             Page 4 of 11
revegetation. The total cost of this plantation effort amounts to Y 36 million (base cost Y
25 million).
16.   The second area stretches from Guilin city (at Elephant Mountain) to Yangshuo
town and covers a total area of 2630 hectares. Of this, 230 hectares will be planted with a
combination of gingkoes and bamboo, about 1300 hectares along the Lijiang embankment
will be dedicated to general plantation, and an area of 1 100 hectares of hillside land will be
closed off for natural reforestation. The total cost is Y 50 million (base cost Y 36 million).

Environmental and Social Benefits
17.   Irrigation efficiency and reliability would be improved in Wulixia following the
implementation of the project. More water will be available for Guilin City during the dry
season with the Lijiang River increasing its flow from 30 to 37.5 m3/s. The increased flows
would provide dilution water and thus avoid further deterioration of Lijiang River water
quality in the vicinity of Guilin in the near future (years 2000 to 2005). To improve water
quality and sustain the improvements into the future, wastewater treatment works should
proceed in parallel.
18.   Increased hydropower generation that would result from the implementation of the
Wulixia subproject is estimated to be 5 million Kwh/year. Although modest, this would
contribute significantly to electrification in the project area. Hydropower is a renewable
source of energy. Its environmental benefit with respect to preventing air pollution from
coal-fired thermal plants has been quantified in terms of environmental externality values,
but has not been included in the economic analysis.
19.   The improvement of existing roads and the construction of new roads in conjunction
with the projects would be a significant benefit to rural communities in the project area. A
significant amount of money would be injected in the local economy over the construction
period through the hiring the manpower. The plantation and embankment programs would



Annex 6
101                           Page 5 of 11
also reduce the economic loss of the rural community due loss of farmland and also
generate some income from the sale of bamboo and gingko.
Economic Evaluation
20.   The additional 5 million Kwh of hydropower generation associated with the Wulixia
schemes would cost $5.3 million. Assuming a 20-year life and O&M costs at 5% of the
construction costs, about 25% of the projects can be justified by the hydropower benefits
alone (significantly more than the incremental costs of hydropower). This assumes a
conservative estimate of the economic value of power to be 0.06 $/Kwh, and an
opportunity cost of capital of 12%,
21.   Tourists spend approximately $100 million per year in Guilin. Although the tourist
experience is virtually eliminated when the boats cannot navigate the river, some tourists
still visit Guilin during these times. It is therefore difficult to estimate the increased
revenues that could be generated from having higher guaranteed flows. Although flows
vary considerably from year to year, the project would increase the opportunities for
navigating the river by an average of about 6% per year (guarantee increases from 94% to
100% for 30 m3/s). If we assume a one-to-one relationship (which is not the case) between
opportunity time for navigating the river and total tourist revenues, the increased revenues
would amount to about $6 million (not taking into account the benefits related to
supplemental flows in excess of 30 m3/s). Using the same assumptions as in the previous
paragraph, the remaining 75% of the Wulixia costs after considering the hydropower
benefits could be justified with only $860,000 in increased tourist revenues or 14% of the
$6 million.
22.   The annual amount of water being supplemented to the river during the 4 driest
months is about 78 million m3. The opportunity cost of water in the Lijiang Basin has been
variously estimated from between $.06 and $ 0.33/ m3 (hydropower and radish production,
respectively). The lower value would translate to an annual benefit of about $4.7 million.
Therefore if the supplemental water ends up being used for other purposes in the Lijiang
River, the economic benefits could be much greater than the tourism benefits. This,
however, brings up the concern of the sustainability of the minimum flows in the river
provided by the project which is discussed in the Institutional Arrangements section below.
Financial Arrangement for Wulixia
23.   Representatives of Guilin City, Guilin Prefecture and the Regional government
reaffirmed their commitment to the principal of 'beneficiary pays'. While the scheme is
technically under the jurisdiction of the Prefecture, the Municipality stands to gain much
from the increased water supply as well as from the higher tourist traffic. During
negotiations, the following guiding principles of cost recovery was agreed upon between the
Municipality and Prefecture:



102                             Annex 6
Page 6 of 11
a.    The annual debt service requirement will be calculated based on:
i.    Total Loan (including World Bank and domestic loans): up to 80 %
of the total cost.
ii.    Total Cost: actual expenses as verified by the Regional Audit
Bureau, subject to a maximum of Y 50 million including interest
during construction.
iii.   Interest Rate: the average of actual interest rate paid.
iv.  Loan payback period: the average of the actual loan payback period.
b.   The funds for this debt service will be raised firstly from the net income from
additional power generation. This net income will be the actual revenues from
additional power generated due to the project, minus actual operating expenses for
the additional power generation, as verified by audit.
C.   The remaining debt service obligation will be funded by the Guilin
Municipality and other beneficiaries, in consideration of value of benefits derived
from increased water supply during the dry season.
24.   It has been estimated that GM will benefit from an additional 78 million m3 of water
each year, for which it should submit payment to GP. Another source of revenue for
Wulixia is the additional 1 MW of power generated. As an illustrative example, following
the principles of agreement and assuming current day interest rates, GM would have to pay
roughly Y 0.05 per m3 for the additional water they receive to support the project's
remaining debt service. This compares to the economic price of replenishment water of
roughly Y 0.04 per m3. This was computed by discounting the value of the investment
over an assumed 20 year life of the project. If GM chooses to raise funds for this payment
by increasing the ticket price for boat tours, an increase of either Y 5 a person for domestic
visitors or Y 15 a person for overseas visitors would be sufficient.

Institutional Development
25.   Lijiang Commission. Under the project, a new institution - Lijiang Coordination
Commission (henceforth referred to as the Commission), will be created to achieve three
main objectives -- (a) to co-ordinate the implementation of the Lijiang project as a whole,
(b) to co-ordinate pricing and ensure tariff collection for water replenishment, and (c) to
implement water use planning and conservation efforts. The Commission will be chaired
by a vice governor and have representatives from the Regional Planning Commission,
Finance Bureau, Environmental Protection Bureau, Water Resources Bureau, as well as
Guilin City and Guilin Prefecture.
26.   Implementation and Responsibilities. Under its function as project
implementation co-ordinator, the Commission will be set up in Guilin city to oversee the
individual project offices for the subcomponents of Wulixia water works, embankment
works and plantation works. The existing Wulixia Reservoir Operation Office under the
Xingan county of Guilin Prefecture will be responsible for the implementation of the
Wulixia water supplement sub-project. This Office will also own and operate the facilities
implemented under the project and be primarily responsible for generating the revenues to
repay the Bank loan. A second important task of the Commission therefore, would be to
monitor compliance to the financing and cost sharing principles among the beneficiaries.
27.   Future Development. The Commission will grow out of its consultative role
and, through the Wulixia Operation Office, have authority for water replenishment and
other reservoir operations. Wulixia and other water bureaus in the Lijiang basin would be
kept as independent entities, but reservoir and gate operations would be co-ordinated and
directed by the Commission. With authority delegated by the owners of various water
works in the basin, it would gradually take over some of their management and operation
functions. During this period, the internal management of the water works operations
would be strengthened. This includes the introduction of a computerized management
information system (MIS) for day-to-day management and cost control, runoff and flows
forecasting, financial optimization and training on project and operations management, and
monitoring. The Commission would work with local water and power bureaus on the
establishment of water rights system and water use, allocation and fees systems.
28.   Eventually, the Commission should transform into a Lijiang Water Resources
Management Authority (hereafter referred to as Authority). A possible developmental path
towards the Authority is outlined in the project files and a summary is shown in the Table
2. The Authority would become financially independent, and could initiate and start other
water projects in the Lijiang Basin.

Small Area Improvement
A. Background
1.           The fast growth of China's urban population since the early 1 980s has been more
than matched by high rates of investments in housing and infrastructure which have transformed
the urban landscape significantly. Most of the investments have taken the form of high-value new
development replacing former farmland in urban peripheries or old urban neighborhoods, whose
development has been suppressed by regulatory and financial constraints before the economic
liberalization. By unlocking the value of the under-utilized land, the new development or
redevelopment allows large increases in land use density and large economic and financial returns.
The revenues are usually sufficient to pay for all costs including generous compensation for the
existing land use, a full range of on-site infrastructure and even substantial municipal charges.
This allows municipal governments to focus their limited fiscal and managerial resources on trunk
infrastructure.
2.           While large-scale development and infrastructure projects are likely to remain the
major mode of urban development in China, limited upgrading of existing urban areas (in situ)
should be an increasingly important complement. As more urban areas are developed to high
value use, opportunities for profitable new development become more scarce while the need to
upgrade them grows as they age. Financing is another critical constraint. In typical Chinese
cities, new residential developments cost at least three times the average annual per capita income.
Given the limited resources, excessive reliance on expensive new developments would leave a
large part of demand for urban services unmet for a long time, especially for the poor. Even after
nearly two decades of extraordinarily high levels of investment, a large part of urban areas remain
with poor housing and infrastructure in sharp contrast to the new developments. The gap is likely
to persist in the future as investment growths are projected to be more constrained while urban
population growth is expected to accelerate. The need for small-scale upgrading would increase
as the population, income, and the demand for urban facilities increase, as new developments age,
and the investment resources remain constrained.
3.           Limited and gradual upgrading is an efficient option for a large part of any city, as
complete redevelopment is often too costly in terms of the value of the existing assets or in
comparison to the residents' affordability. In many cities of China, there has been a strong
tradition of cooperative maintenance and upgrading of neighborhood facilities. The urban growth
and transition to market, however, have weakened the tradition by focusing the municipal
government's financial and management capacities on large scale developments and weakening
neighborhood organizations. Not being a clear individual responsibility such as housing,
neighborhood upgrading requires a cooperative framework to pool the resources. Experiences in
other countries show that when neighborhood facilities are improved, the housing investment
increases. In order to meet the increasing demand for the urban services especially at the tertiary
level under the scarcity of public resources, it is therefore important that a framework is re-
established for efficient cooperative upgrading of neighborhoods.



Annex 7
109                              Page 2 of 11
4.           The case for gradual, low-cost upgrading is particularly strong in the cities of
Guangxi. Compared with other regions of China, cities of Guangxi started the recent urban
development later, have lower income levels, and faster growth of urban population especially
from the countryside. While there have been substantial major new developments in Nanning and
Guilin, there remain a large number of urban neighborhoods suffering from poor quality of such
basic facilities as access road, drainage and sewerage, public toilets, and garbage collection.
Many old industrial-residential areas near the city center have developed over the years by
gradually increasing density of housing, now featuring two to five storeys, and population, over-
stretching the existing infrastructure. Another type is former rural villages in the urban
peripheries that have turned into urban areas, which are only beginning to develop basic urban
infrastructure.
5.           While upgrading is an efficient option for a wide range of urban areas and
population, it is almost the only option for poorer segments of the population. The majority of
the urban poor in China are migrants from rural areas, often without permanent city residency
permits. In Nanning and Guilin, population without permanent registration has surged in the last
decade and is estimated to account for around 20% of the urban population. They are scattered
around the city, mostly renting spaces in areas with poorer facilities described above. There are
also some substantial informal settlements of these people, rarely seen in other Chinese cities.
Nanning and Guilin governments have been accommodating or at least tolerant of temporary
residents, and have provided basic urban services including water supply, garbage collection and
schooling to large informal settlements. However, housing and neighborhood level facilities of
drainage, sewerage, access roads, that are residents' responsibility, are of very low quality.
6.           Preliminary surveys show that communities overwhelmingly support upgrading:
regardless of the age and/or quality of existing housing. Preservation of communities as they exist
and preventing their dislocation is an important household concern. The status of urban facilities
in Nanning and Guilin and the prospect of their fast growth heighten the need for low-cost
upgrading, and the municipal governments' policies are hospitable toward progressive and
equitable urban development. These factors make the two cities of Guangxi suitable areas in
which to establish a model of participatory upgrading, which would be needed in most cities of
China.
B. The Objective and Scope of Improvements
7.           The project will support a pilot program of small area improvement subprojects in
order to help establish a system of efficient cooperative upgrading of neighborhood infrastructure.
The subprojects would aim at cost-effective upgrading of existing small areas, especially those
with low levels of facilities and incomes, through low-cost solution to high priority infrastructure
deficiencies; and full participation of beneficiaries in identification, design, and implementation of
the improvements.
8.           The project would support improvement of any common facilities within the
participating small areas that the area residents choose and contribute to. Types of common
neighborhood facilities that are deficient in many areas and general standards of improvement are
suggested as below:



Annex 7
110                              Page3of 11
*  Drainage: tertiary, and at limited instances, secondary drains designed to deal with
annual average peak storm flow; provided mostly in the form of road-side covered box
drains, and in the form of small-diameter PVC or concrete pipes in the case of
combined sewerage and drainage.
*  Sewerage: small-bore sewers or small-diameter conventional sewers could be
considered in the case of areas with population density higher than 200 persons per
hectare, and where appropriate connection to secondary or primary sewer can be made
readily.
*  Septic Tanks: provision or repair of shared septic tanks when connection to trunk
sewer is not available or more expensive than septic tanks to build and operate.
*  Public Toilets: provision or repair of public toilets at a rate of one seat per not less
than 20 users (those residents without individual toilets),
*  Access Roads and Footpaths: stone or concrete pavement up to 4 meters wide.
*  Solid Waste Collection: provision of road-side concrete garbage bins, and provision or
repair of neighborhood solid waste depots.
*  Water Supply: build or repair water storage tanks or water pumps for areas on high
grounds with unreliable water supply.
  Landscaping and amenities: plantation and other improvements to neighborhood roads
and common grounds.
9.           Any area that is not slated to redevelopment within five years or so would be
eligible for support under the project for varying extents and types of upgrading. The maximum
size of the area to be covered should be limited in principle to subdistricts or a few neighborhood
committee areas, because larger areas would involve trunk infrastructure and beneficiary
consultation would become difficult to manage. The design standards discussed above and the
requirement of beneficiary contribution (described under "Financial Arrangements") would
naturally limit the extent of upgrading supported under the project and tend to favor poorer
communities. Areas that already have relatively high-quality facilities would require minor
improvements. Extents of improvements in areas with extensive deficiencies would be primarily
determined by the affordability of beneficiaries.
10.          However, priorities may have to be established among different small areas to
determine the order of implementation and the extent of municipal subsidy. The priority can be
determined by a weighted assessment of a few factors that predict feasibility and efficiency of
participatory upgrading. A tentative list of the factors, to be scored one to three points, and their
weights is as follows:



Annex 7
111                             Page4of II
*  Participation (weight 3): the degree of resident involvement, existence of strong and
active community organization, and the extent of prior consultation conducted
*  Extent and Degree of Environmental Deficiency (weight 5): stagnant storm water and
sewage, availability and status of sewers and toilets, difficulty in solid waste collection
and transfer, access roads, water supply, etc.
*  Health Status: (weight 2): incidence of environment-related illness;
*  Population density (weight 2): score 3 for more that 400 persons per hectare, score 1
for less than 200.
*  Residents' Income and Occupation (weight 2): score 1 for high average income (more
than 50% higher than the city average), score 3 for incomes less than 50% of city
average or more than 50% of residents holding informal jobs.
Responsibilities
11.         The key to successful in situ upgrading of small areas is full "ownership" by local
residents through their active participation in all aspects -- identification, design, financing,
implementation, and maintenance of improvements. For many upgrading projects, beneficiaries
are asked to contribute to implementation and financing, but not in planning. This misses the
most important input, the user's judgment of the value of improvements, and deprives the
residents of motivation to contribute to implementation and maintenance. On the other hand,
decision making by the beneficiaries without significant financing and maintenance responsibilities
also abandons the incentive to find the most cost-effective improvements. Further, compared
with most new developments which often generate net revenues to the municipal governments,
lack of cost recovery would make it impossible for municipalities to support upgrading on a
sustained basis.
12.         All affected local residents therefore have to be fully informed and make all key
decisions -- choice of facilities to improve, technical options and materials to use, amounts of
investment, allocation of costs, and implementation management and acceptance. Traditionally in
Chinese cities, various neighborhood activities have been coordinated and monitored by the
neighborhood or Subdistrict (small area) committees. For small area improvement subprojects,
the committee will organize the residents, and on their behalf, "own" and carry out day-to-day
planning and management activities. Certain subprojects would involve more than one
committee. They are, however, limited in managerial, technical, and financial capabilities and will
require assistance from governmental and professional organizations.
13.         The municipal government will be the main partner with the communities and
provide supplemental contributions, including a significant share of the cost by assuming the loan
from the World Bank and managerial and technical support. The municipal contributions will be
provided and coordinated through the District Governments (DG), subdivision directly below the
municipality normally responsible for tertiary and some secondary infrastructure and services and
for oversight of neighborhood committees. The district government will identify and select



Annex 7
112                             Page5of I1
interested neighborhood committees and appoint a staff as co-manager of the project, to work
along with the community representative on a small area improvement team (SAIT). In the case
of suburban county areas, township governments will play the role equivalent to the district
governments in the cities. In subprojects involving a relatively large number of residents, it could
be necessary to selected a small number of residents to serve as "focus groups" to provide
reactions to activities that SAIT carries out, instead of involving all local residents.
14.         The project teams would report to, and guided by the city-level project
management office (PMO) directing the overall Guangxi Urban Environment Project. The city
PMO would be responsible for providing high-level policy direction and support such as setting
the total financial assistance (mainly in the form of credit repayment) by the municipal
government, disbursement of the credit, and technical and managerial assistance not available at
the district level. Another important role of the PMO would be to ensure that systems developed
for small area improvement for individual areas are evaluated, replicated, and modified across the
city in order to achieve the aim of the component, to establish a model of small area upgrading
applicable for the city as a whole.
15.         Physical works for the small area improvement are in general expected to involve
simple technology and readily available material, requiring relatively little engineering design
work. However, they will require advice and assistance for design choice and implementation
management from engineers with long experience in a broad range of practical design and
supervision tasks. More time consuming would be social workers' assistance to neighborhood
groups to facilitate the beneficiary participation and to advocate their interests. The city PMO
would retain a small number of social workers and engineers for advice and initial organization
work to assist its own work as well as assist the small area teams. It will also provide the SAITs
with a list of additional qualified consultants, supplier and contractors and provide assistance in
managing the contracts. Non-governmental organizations and academic institutions will be
eligible to compete for the social works contracts.
Financial Arrangements
16.         The cost of small area improvements will be borne by the beneficiaries and the
municipal government. In general, the municipal government would make its contribution by
assuming the obligation to repay the World Bank loan (IDA credit). The latter would be
disbursed for 75% of cost of goods (including equipment rental) and 1 00% of cost of technical
services in social works, engineering and project management services. This is expected to
finance between 45% and 70% of the total cost, but usually between 50% and 60% of total cost.
The credit would be subject to a maximum of 70% of the cost or $100 per beneficiary, whichever
is lower. The disbursement will be made as the bills are due, out of the Special Account held at
the Regional Finance Bureau.
17.         Beneficiaries will be responsible for the rest, namely, 25% of cost of goods and
100% of labor. The labor may be provided in kind, in which case the labor contribution will be
valued according to prevailing market wages for simple construction labor on the basis of time or
piecework. The beneficiary community would decide how its contribution would be allocated
among its members. The common method being accepted through consultations that have taken



Annex 7
113                              Page6of l1
place appears to be uniform contribution per head of per household with some consideration
given to more indigent members. However, the case of a relatively large area where consultations
have been futile appears to indicate the need for differentiate the charges according to distribution
of benefits. The beneficiaries' contributions to investment costs would be completed during the
implementation. Normally they would not be financed or paid over years after the completion.
18.         If the financing responsibility is assigned as above -- credit repayment by the
municipality and remainder financed by the beneficiaries, the beneficiaries' share of cost would
generally be about 40% to 50% of total cost, an appropriate level of cost sharing individually as
well as for the component as a whole. It is important to note, however, the municipal government
may set cost sharing for individual small areas independently of the credit disbursement, in view
of the residents' income and the degree to which the improvement project includes facilities used
by residents in other areas of the city, provided that the beneficiaries' share should be not less than
25% of the cost in any case. For example, the municipality may decide to assume 70% of the cost
when a low-income community undertaking improvements that include secondary-level drainage
channel that serves other areas as well as its own. However, the composition of costs between
labor, goods, and services in this particular case may result in the IDA financing 50% of the cost.
In this case, the municipality will provide additional 20% of the cost in addition to assuming the
debt service obligation. On the other hand, the municipality may require a high income
community to pay 60% of the cost of high-standard improvements, even though the IDA credit
disbursement amounts to more than 50% of the cost.
Documentation and Procedures
19.         Formal planning and implementation procedures traditionally used in China for
larger-scale projects would have to be modified to reflect characteristics of the small area
improvement. Technical simplicity and low cost of physical works suggest simplification of
technical documentation and review procedures. On the other hand, the large number of
participants in the planning and implementation process requires broad information sharing and
unambiguous documentation of various responsibilities. These considerations recommend the
following procedures and documentation requirements:
*  Project Information Bulletin: a brief note from city PMO to district governments and
neighborhood committees informing the availability of support for small-scale improvement of
neighborhood facilities, requirements on the part of the beneficiaries, and how to express their
interest.
*  Small Area Status Brief. compilation of basic information on socio-economic and physical
status of the area (see paragrapL 10 above), prepared by the interested neighborhood
committee from mostly existing information, plus a brief indication of the residents' priorities
for improvements and their willingness to participate.
* Notice of Small Area Improvement Subproject: notice of the election and formation of small
area improvement team (SAIT) to prepare and manage the subproject, roles of different
members, and the municipal government's agreement in principle to support the subproject --



114                                  Annex 7
Page 7of 11
issued by the district government in consultation with the city PMO and neighborhood
committees.
*  Review of Improvement Options: a clear characterization of problems and a brief description
of a few options to deal with each problem, their expected effects and preliminary cost
estimation including contingencies, implied financial burden on residents -- to be prepared by
SAIT and consulting engineer in lieu of the feasibility study for review and discussion by all
residents.
*  Small Area Improvement Plan: a description of improvement works to be undertaken,
implementation methods and schedule, operation and maintenance requirements and
responsibilities, estimated costs indicating a breakdown between materials, works, and
services and including at least 10% contingencies, the estimated IDA credit disbursement,
beneficiary payment schedules, attaching detailed engineering drawings and technical
specifications, and a detailed list of charges by household -- to be prepared by SAIT assisted
by engineers and social workers, to be reviewed and approved by all residents.
* Small Area Improvement Subproject Agreement: a contract between the SAIT and city PMO
specifying the responsibilities of each party, attaching the Small Area Improvement Plan.
20.          Procurement and Disbursement. If a subproject requires more than $100,000 of
materials, the World Bank procedures for international or national competitive bidding and the
model documents will be used. If required materials are estimated to cost less than $100,000,
purchases for different subprojects will be combined whenever possible, and procured through
competitive bidding. Otherwise, materials will be procured by comparison of at least three
quotations for same specification of materials. Service providers (engineering consultants, social
workers, supervision or works contractors) will be selected from a list of qualified providers
prepared by the city PMO. Invoice for the materials and services will be submitted to the city
PMO, which will in turn apply for disbursement of credit out of Special Account and keep the
payment records for inspection by the Audit Bureau and the World Bank. Civil works contracts,
when required, will be awarded through national competitive bidding or through comparison of
three or more quotations. In either case, the model contract for small works will be used.
Process of Participatory Planning and Implementation
21.          The success of in situ upgrading of small areas requires full participation of
beneficiaries, as an essential means to ensure: identification of the most appropriate and cost-
effective types and extents of improvement; mobilization of necessary investment resources, and
adequate operation; and full use and maintenance of the improved facilities. This Section
describes the planning and implementation process of small area improvement subprojects with
full participation of beneficiaries. Operationally, such a process can be characterized as the
process through which stakeholders influence and share control over the development initiatives
and the decisions and resources which affect them through information sharing, consultation,
joint decision making, and action and empowerment.

22.           In many cases, well-organized neighborhoods would be able to plan and carry out
small-scale improvements of common facilities without external assistance or lengthy processes.
However, in many other cases requiring significant improvements, external assistance would be
required to facilitate the beneficiary participation or to supplement the technical and financial
resources. The process described below is based on a format which has been field-tested in other
countries and adapted to the administrative and social contexts at hand in Nanning and Guilin
through testing and consultation in the two cities. Activities may not necessarily proceed in
distinct steps listed below. They may overlap in time, and decisions often would have to be
reviewed in light of better information obtained later. For simple subprojects, many of the steps
may be bypassed.

Systems Development during Implementation
23.           By the time of appraisal, eight areas in Nanning and five areas in Guilin have been
identified for potential support under the small area improvement component of the project, and
preliminary survey of the areas and improvement proposals have been prepared. It was decided to
focus serious consultation and engineering efforts on one area in each city to prepare them to start
the improvement works in the middle of 1998. Guangxi Social Science Academy has been
retained to facilitate the participatory planning process, working closely with national technical
consultants on reviews and visits to the small areas. After the planning process draws near
completion for these two, preparation would start on one or two additional neighborhoods in each
city.
24.           The component is essentially an experiment, and needs to be managed as such.
Due to the lack of established procedures or even the common understanding of basic elements,



Annex 7
117                             Page 10 of 11
the process of selecting and preparing the subprojects has been characterized more by trial and
error rather than efficiency. Although the understanding has clearly increased and the process has
become more efficient, it is likely that the learning process will continue throughout the project
period. Therefore, it would be important that the experiences with individual areas are evaluated
and the processes and arrangements modified as the project proceeds. Contributing to the initial
difficulties has been the fact that most of the areas identified so far have been selected in view of
their serious environmental deficiencies, especially in Nanning. Therefore the required
improvements are estimated to require relatively heavy financial contribution from the residents,
and the engineering and consultation tasks are substantial and complicated. Some of the small
area subprojects currently proposed appear not feasible without seriously reducing the scope or
radically different technical options to reduce cost. The next phase of the implementation include
small areas requiring simple and limited improvement works and therefore allow relatively easy
agreements on technical and financial arrangements.
25.          In addition to learning through implementation, it would be necessary to carry out
a training and technical assistance program to develop and disseminate effective procedures and
skills for participatory upgrading. One level of training would be aimed at senior municipal
managers, city and district staff, and national consultants. These persons and external consultants
will train other district staff and neighborhood committees in skills necessary to carry out specific
small area subprojects, normally lasting less than a week at the beginning of a planning process for
selected small areas. Training of the former type would consist of the following:
Seminars and hands-on advice by national and international experts in participation and in
low-cost technology: about six visits of a month each; estimated cost YI,000,000
Study tours in country by municipal managers, PMO and district staff: 5 persons x 7 days x 4
times; estimated cost Y 250,000
Study tours overseas by municipal managers, PMO and district staff: 6 persons x 15 days x 2;
estimated cost Y 650,000
Expected Impact, Outcome and Monitoring Indicators
26.          The small area improvement component as a whole is targeted to provide
improved environmental benefits to about 1 10,000 people who are current residents, estimated
one the basis of average cost of about Y 1,300 per person. It is expected that some 70% of the
beneficiaries would have incomes below the city average. It is also expected that the
improvements would induce increase in housing assets and in population, adding up to 30% to the
number of direct beneficiaries.
27.          Beyond the above planning targets, it is not possible at this point to set specific
targets for various aspects of the expected benefits of the component as a whole. One basic
indicator of progress could be the number of beneficiaries

However, it would also be necessary to measure the following indicators before and after small
area subproject implementation, and use them for planning purposes:
Input Indicators
average service cost per hectare, per household

increase in rents and transactions prices of housing units;
increase in real estate transaction
number of additional persons absorbed by upgraded neighborhoods;
decrease in water-borne diseases among beneficiary population.

Land Acquisition and
Resettlement Action Plan
Introduction
1.    The Chaoyang Stream sewerage control scheme in Nanning City will require some
human resettlement. Therefore a Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared in
order to facilitate the mitigation of the adverse impacts of the project.
2.    This annex describes the likely land acquisition and resettlement impact of the
GUJEP and discusses the framework developed by the Regional and Municipal Governments
for implementing and financing land acquisition and resettlement activities. Essentially, due
to sewerage related works at the Chaoyang strearn, 89 mu of land will be requisitioned and
926 people will be relocated from along both sides of the stream.
3.    The Chaoyang is one of the tributaries of the Yongjiang River in Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region. It is 14.26 km long, flows north to south and through the center of
the city and drains into the Yongjiang River at Dakengkou, the most economically active
part of Nanning. As economic development of Nanning progresses, the water quality in the
Chaoyang Stream has also deteriorated. The Nanning Municipal Government (NM)
decided to control the sewage and clean up the river water in 1992. Major works under the
Bank supported project include: (1) the river training works; and (2) the sewage control
works. Land acquisition and resettlement are involved in two sectors. They are (a) the
twin interceptor sewers along the Chaoyang Stream from the Middle School No. 13 to the
river mouth; (b) two pumping stations at the river mouth, a siphon from the Chaoyang river
mouth to the other side of the Yongjiang River, a waste water treatment plant and the trunk
sewers at the south of the Yongjiang River.
Census & Socioeconomic Survey
4.    In June 1996, the Chaoyang Stream Management Office (under the Construction
Bureau) performed a census in a river range of 60 meters wide and 8.9 km long from the
river mouth to the Heavy Machinery Plant. The census included the name, age, sex, job of
each project affected person (PAP), family address and size, house structure and space, and
house ownership status of those living in this range. The income was surveyed in samples.
Information on the number of people affected in the enterprises and public institutes was
collected.
5.    In the spring of 1996, the Municipal Women's Association made a socioeconomic
survey in the Chaoyang Basin under the guidance of the Australian specialists. One of the
objectives of the survey was to study the relationship between poverty and resettlement.
The survey was done for regions upstream of the Youai Bridge. The finding of the survey
showed that people living in what were clearly very bad quality urban areas, in terms of
pollution and dwelling quality, were not poor, particularly those who operated restaurants



Annex 8
120                            Page 2 of 6
along the stream. Such business operations were also party to polluting the stream. Only
72% of those polled were in favor of improving the condition of the Chaoyang Stream.
6.    The preliminary design and the 1:500 relocation map of the Chaoyang scheme was
worked out in November 1996. With the support of the monitoring unit, the Chaoyang
Stream Management Office made another door to door field survey and finalized the
quantity of the affected persons and assets in December 1996.
Project Impacts
7.    The total land, house and people affected are summarized below:
Table 1.

(mu)      (in')  (Household / People)
(a) Downstream interceptor sewers  10  12,987  222 / 926
(b) Other structures     79         -
TOTAL             89      12,987     222/ 926
8.    89 mu of land would be acquired from the collective, out of which 10 mu of
vegetable plots are for the new buildings of the relocatees and 79 mu of wasteland for the
water treatment plant and pumping stations. 926 people in 222 households would move
from along the Chaoyang to the Yonghe Chaoyang Residential Area, 2.6 km away. The
relocation would not affect any jobs since all the houses demolished are residential houses.
186 vulnerable people in 30 families are included in the PAP.
Minimization of Land Acquisition and Resettlement
9.    The minimization of the PAP was one of the key factors to change the project
designs of the sewage control system. Housing area to be demolished was greatly reduced
from 60 meters of river width to 31 meters at the downstream section below the Middle
School No. 13. The retaining walls at the downstream section would remain even though
the space between the two walls is less than 31 meters. Instead of an open ditch, a jacking
method would be used for construction. These measures also helped to reduce the
resettlement area.
10.   The construction of the wastewater treatment plant and the pumping station on the
south bank of the Yongjiang River would be on waste land and no persons would be
affected.



Annex 8
121                           Page 3 of 6
Objectives and Principles of Resettlement
11.   The main objective of resettlement is to relocate project affected persons such that
their livelihoods will be improved or at least maintained. The main principles for
implementing the RAP are as follows:
(a)   Minimize land acquisition and relocation as much as possible through
changes in project designs;
(b)   Pay compensation for all relocated residential houses at the replacement
cost;
(c)   Improve the living conditions of the relocated residents and ensure that their
income is not affected by the relocation;
(d)   Pay compensation for acquisition of the cultivated land to the collective.
This compensation would be used to increase the productive capacity of the
collective and would not be used for any other purposes;
(e)   Special care would be taken for the vulnerable groups;
(i)   The RAP is worked out with the participation of the PAPs and these people
have avenues for redress of their grievances;
(g)   The implementation of the RAP would be monitored and evaluated by an
independent unit.
Legal Framework and Resettlement Policies
12.   The RAP has been prepared based on the following laws, regulations and guidelines
for land acquisition and resettlement issued by various authorities in China:
(a)   The People's Republic of China Land Management Law.(1988);
(b)   The Management Regulation of Urban House Demolishing (1991);
(c)   The Land Management Implementation Act of Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region (1992);
(d)   The Management Regulation of Urban House Demolishing of Nanning
Municipality (1996);
(e)   The Regulation on Compensation Rate of Land Acquisition from the Rural
Collectives of Nanning Municipality (1994).



Annex 8
122                                   Page 4 of 6
Positive Effect of Relocation
13.    Since the relocation is from the downtown to the marginal area of the city, an
average increment of 20 sq. m. of living space would be compensated to each household.
The affected person would benefit from an increase in living space from 14 sq. m. to 19 sq.
m, not to mention the improvement of living conditions in the new residential area.
14.    The 222 households who live along the Chaoyang Stream are also the premises'
owners. The relocation is a matter of changing the ownership of same living space from the
old houses into the new apartments. However, 41 households do not possess the House
Ownership Certificate as they are returnees from the political movements or natural
disasters in the past 40 years. The Nanning Municipal Government recognizes their
entitlement and would either support the issue of the House Ownership Certificates or
provide houses to those households.
Costs and Budget
15.    The costs of RAP implementation would be a part of the overall budget of the
Chaoyang Scheme. The total cost of land acquisition and resettlement is estimated to be
approximately Y 38.7 million. The local Land Management Bureau estimated the cost of
land acquisition of the 10 mu cultivated land for the new residential area in a unit lump-sum
as Y 317,600 / mu including land acquisition and resettlement compensation, various taxes
and fees and a Reserve for Production Development. The detailed cost estimates and
annual investment are shown below:

Implementation of Land Acquisition and Resettlement
16.   The resettlement implementation of the Chaoyang Scheme will take 3 years. It
includes:
(a)   Preparation Stage including preparation of RAP, land acquisition,
rehabilitation of the rural PAP, participation of the urban PAP, building of
the new residential area from the end of 1995 to July 5, 1997;
(b)   Land preparation Stage I - including the physical moving of the PAP,
demolishing of structures and clearing of the field for the construction of the
twin interceptor sewers below Middle School No. 13, from July 7 to
October 1, 1997;
(c)   Land preparation Stage II - including land acquisition and preparation for the
sewage treatment plant, the southern trunk sewers and two pumping stations
between October 1, 1998 and October 1, 1999.
Resettlement Institutions and Agencies
17.   The planning and implementation of the Chaoyang Scheme are undertaken by the
Chaoyang Stream Management Office. A Leading Group was set up for cooperation and
coordination of the resettlement issues. Members of the Leading Group are those from the
Municipal Finance Bureau, Audit Bureau, Management of House Property Bureau, Urban
Construction Bureau, Urban Planning Bureau, Land Management Bureau, Nanning Land
Acquisition Office and Nanning Housing Demolition Office.
18.   The Demolishing and Resettlement Sector in the Chaoyang Stream Management
Office is in charge of the daily routine work of resettlement implementation. A training
program is arranged for its staff.
19.   The Municipal Housing Demolition Office is responsible for the internal monitoring,
while the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences takes responsibility for independent
monitoring and evaluation of the resettlement implementation.
Participation and Consultation
20.   The participation process involves the following:
(a)   Representatives of the project affected persons (PAP) participated in the
census and social economic survey. Their comments on rehabilitation plans
and compensation rate have been included in the RAP;



124                             Annex 8
Page 6 of 6
(b)   PAPs participate in the mobilization meetings and gives feedback on
resettlement policies and compensation rates;
(c)   PAPs visit the new residential area and consult with resettlement officers on
apartment selection;
(d)   The resettlement officers visit the affected households to resolve any
difficulties or doubts the PAPs have before signing their moving contracts;
(e)   A sample survey of PAPs rehabilitation will be undertaken after the complete
relocation;
(f)    The independent monitoring unit will visit the affected persons and
enterprises/agencies during the resettlement process.
Redressal of Grievances and Appeals Process
21.   Since the entire Resettlement and Rehabilitation program is being carried out with
the participation of the PAPs, it is expected that no major grievance issue will arise.
However, to ensure that the PAPs have avenues for redressing their grievances related to
any aspect of land acquisition and resettlement, detailed procedures of redressal of
grievances have been established for the project.
Monitoring Indicators
22.   The following monitoring indicators are proposed:
(a)   Compensation Payment - ideally three months before the activity starts;
(b)   Timely Demolition - houses to be demolished one month before the civil
construction starts;
(c)   Timely Relocation - all PAPs to be moved into the new apartments before
the end of 1998.
Resettlement Reporting
23.   The internal monitoring report on progress of resettlement implementation, or the
Resettlement Progress Report would be submitted by the Chaoyang Stream Management
Office to the World Bank every 6 months from January 1997 to December 1999.
24.   The Monitoring & Evaluation report will be submitted by the independent M&E unit
of Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences to the Chaoyang Stream Management Office and
the World Bank at the same time every 6 months from January 1997 to December 1999.

Environmental Assessment Summary
Introduction
1.    Environmental Assessments have been carried out for project components in both Guilin
and Nanning. The EAs were prepared by Chinese Research Academy for Environmental Sciences
(CRAES). Located in Beijing, it is the premier environmental research institution in China and
has prepared many EAs. It is generally called upon when there are highly technical issues to
resolve. It's capability in water and air quality modeling is particularly sought after. The EAs
prepared for this project were well done and have been formally approved by the National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA).
Guilin
2.    The city of Guilin has a population of 550,000 and is located in the northeast of Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, 336 km from the capital city of Nanning. The urban area of the city
covers 54 km2, and the suburban area covers 511 km2. Yangshuo (1,428 km2) and Lingui
(2,202 km2) counties are under the jurisdiction of the city of Guilin. In January 1979, the State
Council designated Guilin City as a national key scenic tourist city, and in February 1982, the city
was declared a national historic cultural city. The Guilin Lijiang Environmental Project includes
the following components: water replenishment of the Lijiang River; wastewater treatment system
in Guilin City; and, domestic refuse disposal in Guilin City.
Project Description
3.    Water Replenishment of the Liiiang River: An investment of Y 123 million, the overall
purpose of this component is to improve the water quality of the Lijiang River where it flows
through the city of Guilin by diverting water from the Wulixia Reservoir into the Lijiang. This
component includes:
(i)    water replenishment works for the Lijiang River from the Wulixia Reservoir to
provide 7.5 m3/s of additional flow; including a new 0.392 km section of Nan
canal; 23.1 km Bei canal; and, one power station of 800 kW;

Baseline Conditions
6.    Climate: Guilin and the Lijiang watershed is located in a rainy subtropical monsoon zone,
where winters are short. The average annual air temperature is 190 C. The rainy season is spring
and summer. Annual rainfall ranges from 2,600 mm in the mountains to the northwest, to 1,600
mm in the southeast.
7.    Land use: Annually cultivated land in 1994 was 635,200 ha, of which three fourths was
paddy and the balance dry farmland. Forest covers 214,000 ha, of which 35 % is for the
conservation of water supply, 43 % for timber, and the balances for special forest, firewood,
economic forest and bamboo.
8.    Soils: Soils in Guilin range from loams in the uplands, to alluvium in the bottom lands.
Soils in the area of the proposed Chongkou landfill site were assessed for heavy metals, with
slight contamination of copper, cadmium, and chromium found in several areas.
9.    Vegetation: Vegetation communities are pony-tail pine and conifers. There are 1,415
species of plants in the Guilin area, a key region for broad leafed evergreens. Over a dozen
"precious trees" have been found in the area, including the ginkgo and silver fir. The Guilin area
has 23.1 % forest cover. There are 11 natural reserve zones with a total of 436 ha in the area,
including the Longsheng Flower Reserve, which has been designated as a key natural protection
zone of the state.
10.   Wildlife: Valued animal species include the tiger, white-head leaf monkey, rhesus
monkey, sike, Chinese pangolin, giant salamander, yellow-bellied tragopan, crimson-bellied
tragopan, and Chinese copper pheasant. There are over 140 species of fish in the Lijiang river,
the major species include common carp, crucian carp, and big-eyed Chinese triangular bream.
Lijiang river benthos includes 79 identified species of insects, crustacea, leaches and arachnids.
Aquatic vegetation biomass is on the order of 2.54 kg/M2 and includes vallisneria spiralis, Hydrilla
verticillata and Potanogeton malaianus.
11.   Geology and Geography: The city of Guilin is located in the southwest Nanling
mountains, in a karst basin. The low mountains and hills that form the watershed of the Lijiang
river are located in the southwest of the Nanling Mountains. The Lijiang river is the upper reach
of the Guijiang river of the Xijiang water system of the Zhujiang river watershed. The Lijiang has



Annex 9
127                            Page 3 of 18
a total length of 214 km and a drainage area of 6,050 km2. About 24 km of the Lijiang river flows
through the urban part of Guilin city. The Lijiang valley is a series of open basins and valleys
lying between the mountains, with additional valleys running into the basins.
12.   The valleys to the north of the Darongjiang river, up to the source of the Lijiang river, are
characterized by high and steep mountain peaks, deep and narrow valleys, and straight rapid
rivers. To the south of the Darongjiang river, the valley basins are open and flat, and the rivers
are wide and shallow. Carbonate rocks dominate in the middle and lower reaches of the of the
watershed, a typical karst area of China, with many caves. South of Guilin to the Dayu river are
flat valleys, with river forks, islands, developed terraces and many bends and shoals. South the
Dayu the rivers the river valleys are again steep and deep, and the rivers are narrow and deep.
13.   Hydrology and groundwater: The major river of the Guilin area is the Lijiang, with an
average flow of 120 m3/sec in the dry season, a maximum flow of 4,640 m3/sec, and a minimum
flow of 3.8 m3/sec. The silt content of the Lijiang is the lowest of the rivers in Guangxi. The
Guilin segment of the Lijiang river is shallow with many shoals. Groundwater sources in Guilin
include the surficial alluvial strata, 4 - 7 m deep, with a 5 - 8 m annual variation. Groundwater is
also found in karst tunnels and caves, and sandstones.
14.   Water quality: The Lijiang River is designated as a Grade II River in the area of the
project. Water quality in the Lijiang River has been monitored in 1991, 1994 and 1996, and shows
that most parameters are within the standards for Grade II surface water. Grade II water quality is
meant to support concentrated drinking water sources and protection of rare fish species.
Ammonia exceeded the Grade II standard by a wide margin, dissolved oxygen, coliform bacteria
and petroleum also exceeded the Grade II standards in 1991 - 1994. The water quality
deteriorates from the Dahe section, to Jingpinshan, due to discharges of sanitary wastewater and
non-point sources.
15.   In the area of the proposed wastewater treatment plant in the urban area of Guilin city the
river water exceeded standards for dissolved oxygen, ammonia, petroleum and coliform bacteria.
16.   Tributaries of the Lijiang include: the Xiaodong river is black and gives off noxious odors
due to pollution from irrigation runoff, wastewater from the food processing industry, and
domestic sewage; the Nanxi river, black with noxious odors, seriously polluted by industrial
wastewater; the Ningyuan river, black with noxious odors due to pollution by pharmaceutical,
food processing, dyeing and printing industries and domestic sewage; the Taohua river, showing
biological and petroleum pollution from irrigation runoff, industrial and domestic sewage; and the
Xiangsi river, where the water quality has been fairly good, recently receiving pollution from town
and village enterprises.
17.   The water sources for the project components are the Xiaorongjiang River and Wulixia
Reservoir. All parameters meet standards for Grade II water with the exception of coliform
bacteria, mercury, and petroleum in the Xiaorongjiang River. The concentration of nitrogen in the
Wulixia Reservoir is above standards, all other parameters meet Grade II standards.



128                               Annex 9
Page 4 of 18
18.   In the area of the water replenishing project, the water quality of the Maotou section of
the Lijiang river, and the Qingshitan reservoir is good. The Gantang river and the Lingqu river
has good water quality as well, the major factor being the concentration of ammonia above
standards.
19.   Groundwater quality: Groundwater in Guilin city comes mainly from the karst formation,
and the major pollutants that exceeded standards between 1991 and 1994 are: nitrate, nitrite,
ammonia, manganese, iron, phenol, COD, mercury, cadmium, and zinc. Total hardness and pH
also exceed standards. The most contaminated groundwater accounts for 2.4 % of the total, in
area of the Wucheng-Ximen rice flour mill and brewery; No. 3 Pharmaceutical factory, and the
Yaotou area.
20.   The groundwater quality in the area of the proposed Chongkou landfill site was monitored
at ten locations. The groundwater meets Chinese standards for drinking water, with the exception
of total nitrogen in five of the wells, attributed to fertilizer and pesticide usage, acidic pH at one
well attributed to mother rock, high hardness at one well attributed to calcium and magnesium in
the strata, and high manganese in one well attributed to formation chemistry.
21.   Air quality: Air quality in Guilin meets Chinese grade II standards, with a deteriorating
trend. The major polluters are coal smoke, construction projects, and automobiles.
22.   Air quality in the area of the wastewater treatment project in Guilin city exceeded
standards for TSP at all monitoring points at some time, attributed to local production activities;
SO2 in the monitored area did not exceed grade II standards.
23.   Air quality in the area of the proposed Chongkou landfill meets grade II standards, and
there are no local industrial pollution sources.
24.   Noise: Noise pollution is serious in Guilin City. It is often over the standard of (noise
standard) along 78 % of the roads surveyed in 1994. Traffic and local noise monitored in 1996
did not exceed standards in the areas of the Water Replenishment of the Lijiang River project
components. Noise in the area of the proposed Chongkou landfill exceeds standards, due to
automotive traffic.
25.   In the area of the proposed wastewater treatment plant in the urban area of Guilin city
noise exceeded standards at 8 of the 12 stations monitored, and at two, by a large margin, due to
vehicular traffic.
26.   In the area of the proposed wastewater treatment plant in Xicheng district noise exceeded
standards due to traffic.
27.   Economics: The GNP of the city was 5.19 billion yuan in 1994. Enterprises in the city
are medium to small scale including machine manufacturing, electronics, rubber, light industry,
textiles, food processing and pharmaceuticals. The average annual household income in Guilin is



Annex 9
129                             Page 5 of 18
4,142 yuan, an 11 % increase over the previous year. Average annual income for farmers was
1,137 yuan.
28.   Infrastructure: Guilin has two airports and a railway station which is under construction.
The four water supply treatment plants in Guilin rely on surface water supplies, supplemented by
groundwater. Industrial facilities also have captive water supply facilities; but since the quality
from these is poor, city water is used for potable supply. Wastewater treatment plants treat 89 %
of the wastewater generated in the city. Industrial wastewater treatment that meets standards for
discharge is 45 % of the total discharge. Solid waste in the city is collected at the 15 transfer
stations, and then dumped or piled in the suburbs. About half of the solid waste is processed at a
composting facility. Industrial solid waste is recycled to a large degree; domestic solid waste
disposal is identified as the principal problem. Since landfill capacity is short, domestic solid
waste pollutes soils, surface and groundwater, and air. There is an increasingly serious deficit of
transport and transfer stations for domestic and industrial solid waste.
29.   Historic and cultural landmarks: The natural scenery of the mountains and rivers are
considered a chief asset. Cultural landmarks include the palace and tomb of the former king,
ancient city of Jingjingjiang Prefecture, ruins of the Piye Cave, and the Eighth Route Army's off
in Guilin.
Impacts and Mitigation:
30.   Potential impacts and planned mitigation for construction of the project components is
shown in Table 1.
Impacts and Mitigation During Operations Phase
31.   Impact on water quality of the Lijiang River: The project will increase the flow of the
Lijiang River during dry periods, as well as intercept a portion of the city's point and non-point
source pollution. Calculations indicate that without the project the Lijiang River at Longmen
would have a BOD of 13.63 mg/l and a COD of 13.26 mg/l by the year 2015. It is estimated that
the project can reduce pollutant loadings to the level of BOD of 7.35 mg/l and COD of 7.10 mg/i
which would meet Grade IV water standards. The project will fall short of enabling the Lijiang
River to meet Grade II standards, since the wastewater treatment plants planned can only treat 60
% of the expected wastewater generated in 2015.
32.   The solid refuse collection system will greatly reduce non-point source pollution of the
Lijiang River, and will also reduce groundwater contamination in the city and suburbs.
33.   Impact on Guilin City: The project can help alleviate the solid waste collection and water
pollution problems, especially in the most heavily polluted central city areas.

treatment system     pipelines
34.    Sanitary landfill, air impacts: The sanitary landfill will emit methane, hydrogen sulfide,
ammonia, and sulfur dioxide, which will be collected in a system and flared. The operation of the
sanitary landfill will not have negative impacts on the urban areas of Linggui county. Assessment
of inversions and ambient wind conditions indicates that the area of influence of the landfill will be
within 1 km. High humidity and temperature will increase the rate of methane release, therefore a
monitoring program within the range of 10 km from the landfill is recommended.
35.    Sanitary landfill, groundwater impacts: The main concerns are prevention of leachate
contamination, and stability of the landfill slopes. Sediments from the lake cleanup has been
found to be lightly contaminated according to the Hakanson risk index. Part of this will be
disposed of at the landfill. The landfill will incorporate a leachate liner, to prevent groundwater
contamination, as well as an interior leachate collection and treatment system.
36.    Wastewater treatment plant. air impacts: Wastewater treatment plant sludge drying  can
produce noxious odors; the impact can be reduced if the sludge is transported to another location.
The planned wastewater treatment plants are located to leeward of the city; reducing the potential
for noxious odors nuisance. Sludge thickening, drying and handling facilities are incorporated



132                                 Annex 9
Page 8 of 18
into all of the treatment plant plans. Stabilized sludge would then be disposed off site in the
municipal landfill.
37.   Solid waste transportation, impacts of noise: The refuse disposal project will add an
increment of noise pollution along highways, including Renming Avenue in Linggui. There will
be 126 refuse trucks added, an average of 16 hours/day. The refuse trucks add only 0.3 - 0.4
dB(A), and therefore their contribution to background traffic noise is minimal.
38.   Pumping stations and wastewater treatment plants, impacts of noise: Buffer zones will be
built around these projects, and the pump stations are half underground, therefore, the noise
impact would be limited to the borders and greenbelts.
39.   Impacts on the winter irrigation in the lower reaches of the Wulixia reservoir: After the
water works at the Wulixia reservoir are in operation, the water discharged in the low water
period will increase, benefiting the water quality of the Lijiang River. The amount of water
available for consumption will decrease. According to the project plans, when the Lijiang River
needs water the water would first be drawn from the Wulixia reservoir. The requirements of
winter irrigation of the Wulixia reservoir irrigated area are not taken into consideration, and even
if tunnels are constructed and groundwater resources exploited, there still will not be sufficient
water for winter irrigation. This would be a long term impact.
40.   Lijiang River water replenishment, impact on water replenishment areas: The impact on
the Lijiang River would be positive, since the additional flow would dilute pollution, and help
carry it downstream out of the city. With regards to erosion, the flow augmentation in the Lijiang
would take place only during the dry season; the flow varies by as much as three orders of
magnitude between wet and dry seasons. Since the base flow in the dry season would only be
increased to 40 m3/sec, and this is a small fraction of the normal wet season flow, increased
erosion due to dry season flow augmentation is not expected. The overall water quality impacts
have been modeled and are positive; this would also have positive impacts on the river's
biological communities
Analysis of Alternatives
40.   A comprehensive analysis of the scale, service range, cost and credit repayment ability of
the project components was conducted by the China Municipal Works Design Institute and
Shanghai Municipal Works Design Institute. Two alternative plans were considered for water
replenishment of the Lijiang river, six alternative plans for the wastewater treatment plants in
Guilin, two alternatives for the protection dikes on the Lijiang river, and three alternatives for the
domestic solid waste disposal. Solid waste disposal alternatives considered included sanitary
landfill, incineration, and high temperature compost. The final choice of project component was
the result of least cost analysis.



Annex 9
133                            Page 9 of 18
Strategic Context
42.   The strategy behind the project components is detailed in the Nanning Environmental
Master Plan and Guilin Environmental Master Plan (The S. M. Group International, Inc.),
undertaken as part of project preparation and funded by the Bank.
43.   For Guilin, the priority sectors identified, among others, were water supply, wastewater
treatment. The two issues are related since greater flow through the Lijiang has the effect of
increasing the quantity of water as well as reducing the level of pollution in the water supply.
Clean and abundant water in the Lijiang is also an asset for the tourist trade, general navigation as
well as irrigation (though relatively small).
44.   In its analysis, it was found that in order to protect the multiple functions of the Lijiang,
the river's minimum flow must reach 40 m3/sec by the year 2000, in which case the water quality
could reach Class II of the National Standard. Local planners in Guilin have forecast another
replenishment scheme to reach a minimum flow of 45 m3/sec by the year 2010. As such, the
Lijiang Replenishment Project represents the first step towards a comprehensive and long term
solution to the City's water supply and pollution problems.
45.   Also, the Master Plan has called for the treatment of all sewerage wastewater by the year
2001. The project takes an important first step towards meeting the city's future needs by treating
up to 90 % of the sewerage wastewater. A case in point is provided by the planned expansion of
the Northern Sewage Treatment Plant as well as the new Xicheng treatment plant. Allowances
are given in the design of both facilities to allow for future expansion.
46.   Similarly, the proposed Lijiang Water Resources Committee also serves as part of a long
term solution to future problems of water supply and quality. One of the Committee's first tasks
would be to develop and implement an integrated resource management strategy and water
conservation programs for the region. Finally, under the Project, between 17,000 to 18,000
hectares along the Lijiang and around the Wuilixia water catchment will be reforested to improve
water retention.
47.   In Nanning, the city's Environmental Master Plan has also emphasized the need for
wastewater management facilities as part of an overall long term strategy. Although water quality
simulations are still being finalized, the design and initial capacity of the proposed Jiangnan
Treatment Plant has already been set to accommodate future needs. This plant, together with the
soon to be completed Langdong Treatment Plant serve as the foundation of the City's water
quality management strategy. The proposed rehabilitation and upgrade of the City's existing
combined sewers is also part of long term improvements to its network.
Environmental Management
48.   An environmental protection management system will be established under the project,
with the purpose of implementing laws and regulations concerning environmental protection, to



Annex 9
134                           Page 10 of 18
deal with the relationship between the developing economy and protecting the environment, and
to ensure consistency in environmental, social and economic benefits. The organization will see
to the mitigation measures of the proposed project, and monitor the impacts on the surrounding
areas. The department of environmental protection of the Guilin Lijiang River Comprehensive
Treating Project will have two sections, one responsible for environmental administration and the
other responsible for environmental monitoring. Personnel from the administration and
construction unit will be assigned to the environmental management unit, and Environmental
Monitoring Stations from the Guilin municipal area of the Guilin region would be in charge of
environmental monitoring.
Environmental Monitoring Plan
49.   The environmental monitoring plan covers both construction and operations phases of the
project. Monitoring during construction will include noise and fugitive dust, during the entire
period of construction. Monitoring points for the refuse transfer station construction will be
chosen in densely populated areas.
50.   Environmental monitoring during the project will be carried out in order to assess actual
impacts and changes in environmental quality, to prevent pollution accidents, and to provide a
scientific basis for environmental management. The major items to be monitored include the
regimen used to establish the baseline data for the environmental impact assessment (EIA). In
addition, down stream reaches of the project rivers would have monitoring points for suspended
solids, BOD, COD, nitrogen, phosphorus, and coliform bacteria. The groundwater downstream
of the landfill site will be monitored on the same schedule as used in the EIA, once each season.
Downstream of the refuse transfer points the major items to be monitored include: mercury, lead,
arsenic, cadmium, and others, once each season.
51.   The major sampling and analysis equipment will be procured for the monitoring effort, to
include: computer, air sampler, infrared spectrophotometer, water sampler, analysis balance, BOD
and COD analyzer, high pressure liquid chromatography, toxic gas analyzer, meteorological
survey instrument, NOx, SOx, CO, and TSP analyzer, and a noise survey meter.
Consultation with Affected Groups:
52.   The scope of the public consultation included the areas of construction projects.
Institutions involved included the People's Congress, the members of the political Consultative
Conference, especially farmers. The results of the consultations showed that 90 % of the people
questioned supported the project. Of the persons to be resettled 95 % said they could understand
the short term impacts of the construction of the project, and would support the project if removal
of the houses and resettlement were carried out properly with proper policies.
53.   In developing the Small Area Environmental Improvement components, public
consultation was carried out and discussions included, among others, willingness of the local
residents to contribute to the improvement schemes. Efforts have also been put in to collect
public opinion on the impact of pollution on tourism, and garbage disposal issues.

54.   The city of Nanning began to open to the outside world in 1992, with the sanction of
the State Council. Nanning, the capital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is the
political, economic, financial and cultural center. The purpose of the project is to alleviate
intolerable pollution of the Chaoyang Stream, located in the urban center, as well as to reduce
flooding in the city of Nanning. The Chaoyang Stream is located in the north of Nanning
City, and flows through the urban area into the Yongjiang River. the Yongjiang River divides
the city into north and south sections. The project will include dredging of sediment from the
Chaoyang Stream, installation of sewer interceptors and storm water drains, and building of
the Jiangnan waste water treatment plant. The project is expected to transform the Chaoyang
Stream from a noxious open sewage ditch into an asset to the city landscape. Wastewater
discharges will be moved downstream of the city, protecting the city water supply intakes.
Water quality of the city rivers will be improved. However, there will be a resultant decrease
in water quality in the mixing zone near the Jiangnan wastewater treatment plant, the size of
which will depend on the capacity of the wastewater treatment plant.
Project Description
55.   The Yongjiang River is the main source of potable and industrial water for the city.
There are six major tributaries of the Yongjiang River in Nanning, and three lakes, including
Nanhu Lake. The Chaoyang Stream, a tributary of the Yongjiang, has been receiving
untreated sewage from a quarter of a million people and 70 industrial facilities since the
1970's, serving as the main wastewater discharge ditch in the central part of the city. The
Chaoyang is now heavily polluted and emitting noxious odors. The city does not currently
have an integrated sewage or stormwater discharge system.
56.   The proposed project has two main objectives: renovation of the Chaoyang Stream;
and, improvement of the drainage system of Nanning City. The main components of the
project are: sewage interceptors for industrial and sanitary wastewater in the area along
Chaoyang Stream; construction of the Jiangnan wastewater treatment plant; renovation and
separation of the stormwater system from the sewage system; desilting existing sewage lines;
and, dredging bottom sediments of Chaoyang Stream.
57.   Chaoyang Stream Treatment Project: The Chaoyang Stream flows from north to south
into the Yongjiang River. The stream is 14.2 kilometers long, and the project will involve 8.9
kilometers of it's length. The total amount of sediment to be dredged from Chaoyang Stream
is 200,000 m3. The sediments are heavily contaminated with human and industrial waste,



Annex 9
136                            Page 12 of 18
including heavy metals and will be disposed of in a landfill. This component also includes
sewage interceptors.
58.   Drainage system project in the urban areas of Nanning: This component will involves
laying pipe networks and pump stations for stormwater and sewage in the Xincheng, Xingning,
Chengbei, Yongjiang and Jiangnan districts. Interceptors in the Jiangnan district, a major
industrial area of Nanning, will collect industrial wastewater currently discharged to the
Tingzichong Stream, for treatment in the proposed Jiangnan wastewater treatment plant.
59.   Jiangnan wastewater treatment plant: The plant will be a primary system of 180,000
m3/day capacity with sludge drying provisions. With the addition of the industrial wastewater
collected in the Tingzicheng Stream in the Tingzichong industrial area, it will treat 336,000
m3/day by the year 2005 (see discussion of alternatives).
Baseline Conditions
60.   Geography and Demography: Nanning covers an area of 1,938 km2, with an urban area
of 80 km2; the population of the urban area is 0.76 million, with a total of 1.07 million in the
greater city limits (1994). The topography of Nanning is flat. Nanning is a transportation hub,
with links to the sea, rail lines and an airport. The city is located on the banks of the Yongjiang
River, and is becoming the thoroughfare to the sea for the four provinces of southwest China:
Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Guangxi.
61.   Economy: Total agricultural output reached 2.65 billion yuan in 1994 (1990 fixed price),
an increase of 7.2 % over the previous year. Industrial production was 10.9 billion yuan (1990
price) in 1994, and increase of 18.3% over the previous year. Average income of town
inhabitants is 4,099 yuan/year, an increase of 16.7 %; per capita income of farmers was 1,306
yuan/year, an increase of 10 %.
62.   Climate: Nanning is south of the Tropic of Cancer and enjoys plentiful rainfall (average
1,240 mm/year), 72 % of which occurs from May to September. The average annual
temperature is 21.6 OC, with the highest in July (average 28.30C) and the lowest in January
(average 12.80C).
63.   Flora and Fauna: The total area of forest in the city is 275,300 ha, including pine, fir, gum
and oak. There are no rare species of plants or wildlife in the assessment area.
64.   Cultural landmarks. Mvinority Enclaves: There are no cultural relics under protection or
concentrated national minorities or religious communities in the assessment area.
65.   Infrastructure: Potable water is supplied from four treatment facilities drawing a total of
594,000 t/d, from the Yongjiang River. Some industrial facilities have their own water supply
treatment works. Average per capita consumption of the 852,000 Nanning residents supplied
with water is 412.6 L/day. Most of the sanitary and industrial wastewater is discharged directly



Annex 9
137                            Page 13 of 18
into the Yongjiang River, without treatment. The tributaries of the Yongjiang are heavily
polluted, with black noxious smelling water. The Yongjiang itself is also polluted, severely
affecting the quality of the potable water supply.
66.   Nanning has been suffering from serious and frequent floods, both from the river and
stormwater backups. Since the existing sewers and tributaries have insufficient discharge
capacity, backwaters occur during storms. The embankment of the Yongjiang in Nanning is 34
km long, and there are sluice gates and pump stations at the tributary mouths to control flooding.
67.   Water quality: The six tributaries of the Yongjiang River receive the untreated industrial
and sanitary wastewater of the urban areas of Nanning. The Chaoyang, Erkeng and Zhupaichong
Streams are polluted with organic matter and getting worse. Dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical
oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BODs), ammonia and oil in these tributaries
are above Grade V standards for surface waters set by the state. The Chaoyang Stream is the
most seriously polluted, followed by the Erkeng and Zhupaichong Streams.
68.   Water quality in the Yongjiang River is fairly good before it flows into the urban area of
Nanning; most parameters are within standards for Grade III surface water. The water quality
deteriorates below Grade III as it passes through the city. Below the city at Pumiao, the river
water quality deteriorated to Grade V.
69.   Nanhu Lake: Nanhu lake is the largest lake in Nanning City, with a surface area of one
square kilometer. The lake currently receives untreated sewage and stormwater runoff from the
city. The lake functions as an oxidation pond for wastewater. The water level is adjusted by
sluice. The lake is currently used for aquatic recreation, fishing, agriculture, flood storage an
irrigation, and wastewater discharge. Along the shore in the upper lake is a fingerling pond. The
water quality is below Grade V. The lake is eutrophic with high surface levels of oxygen during
the day, and low dissolved oxygen in the lower strata at night. Farmed fish often die and fish
caught in the lake are perceived to have an odor. Fish stocks have been declining. The water and
bottom sediments have little heavy metal contamination thus far, as the waste input (47,000 m3
dry season) is mainly sanitary.
70.   Sediments in the Chaovang Stream: The Chaoyang Stream has been receiving effluent
from over 100 factories and untreated sewage from a large part of the city. The sediments of the
Chaoyang Stream are heavily polluted with heavy metals (Hg 2.33 mg/kg; Cr 212.4 mg/kg; Cu
346 mg/kg; Zn 805 mg/kg), arsenic and mineral oil (1196 mg/kg), undecomposed night soil,
domestic and industrial organic waste, rubbish and products of organic decomposition. These
sediments will be disposed of in a landfill.
71.   Air quality: The average values of SO2 over four years is a little over the value for Grade
II ambient air quality set by the state. Since the amount of S02 will increase along with
development of the city and it's industry, including an increase in the consumption of coal, it is
estimated that the concentration of ambient SO2 will continue to exceed the standard. The
average value of suspended particulates (TSP) of the urban areas is within the Chinese standard



Annex 9
138                            Page 14 of 18
for Grade II ambient air quality; but exceeds the standard for cities of south China set by the state.
Values of NOx were within the Grade I ambient air quality standard. Noise exceeds standards in
all areas studied, especially at night. Foul smells from the Chaoyang Stream are noted, although
there are no standard comparisons.
72.   Solid waste: Solid waste generated in Nanning includes industrial, sanitary and
construction refuse. The improper disposal of solid waste from Nanning causes much land and
groundwater pollution although a new landfill has recently been completed.
Alternatives Considered
73.   An exhaustive collection of alternative designs of the project was considered. These
included alternative configurations of the sewer networks and different project phasing. The
alternative of routing the sewers to the treatment facility at Langdong was considered; but the
new facility location at Jiangnan was chosen on environmental and cost grounds. There are
two outstanding alternatives that were not resolved in the EIA:
(i)   the design flow rate of wastewater lines in Hongting Road and Baisha
Avenue: design flow should be raised to meet need of industrial region along
Tingzichong Stream, and increase the capacity of the Jiangnan wastewater
treatment plant to take the full flow of the additional 78,200 m3/day wastewater
from Hongting Road and Baisha Avenue;
(ii)   pollution mitigation of Nanhu Lake: control of the amount of rainwater
entering the Nanhu lake from the first storm after the dry season if possible,
route stormwater to Yongjiang River; replenish lake with water drawn from
Yongjiang River.
74.   The alternative of not dredging the sediments of the Chaoyang Stream was considered;
however, the pollutants contained in the sediments would remain mobile, and continue to pollute
the stream.
Major Impacts and Mitigation:
75.   Chaoyang Stream: After completion of the first stage of the project, the water quality in
the Chaoyang Stream will be improved from that of sewage to Grade V, able to meet the demand
for landscape application during the dry season and most of the wet season.
76.   Chaoyang Stream sediments: An international method (Hakanson) of assessing the
ecological risk of the heavy metals in the sediment indicated levels extremely harmful to the
ecology. About 13% of the dredged sediments can be used as fertilizer for lawns and trees;
but not food crops; the remainder is too contaminated for this use, and will be disposed in a



Annex 9
139                           Page 15 of 18
sanitary landfill. Dredging will be done in the dry season from October to April, to prevent
runoff contamination from the dredged spoil piles.
77.   Vehicles moving the dredged spoil would be covered to prevent spillage during
transportation.  Measures will be taken to prevent run-on and run-off contamination of
stormwater at the Santang disposal site. The landfill site is located on permeable soils and
there is the potential for groundwater contamination.  In order to prevent groundwater
contamination, the landfill site will be lined with leachate containment material to reduce
seepage to below 10 -7 cm/sec. Earth fill will be used to seal the top of the landfill, and the
site will be reclaimed with vegetation to prevent erosion.
78.   Yongjiang River: Potable water supplies in the lower reaches of the river in the city
and below are taken from groundwater. There are no other special demands for water quality
in the lower reaches; therefore the water quality target is Grade III. Investigation has shown
that the dry season is the key target period for pollution control in the river. The pollution
control target is for Grade III, with a mixing zone at the discharge of the Jiangnan wastewater
treatment plant of 3,000 m.
79.   The project would collect 35 % of the wastewater from the urban areas of Nanning
City, with discharge to the Yongjiang River after primary treatment, with a reduction of 10 %
of the BOD5 load. Stream modeling has indicated that the pollution plumes in Dakeng and
Erkeng will disappear; those in Tingzichong and Zhupaichong will remain within the standard
of desired water quality; and the pollution plume (mixing zone of the Jiangnan wastewater
treatment plant) of the Shuitangjiang Stream will become longer but not wider. The mixing
zone of the Jiangnan wastewater treatment plant will be 3,000 m in the high water season, and
4,400 m in the low water season and during normal flows. The water quality in the Nanning
section of the Yongjiang River will be improved, especially above Shuitangjiang Stream. The
pollution plume of the Shuitangjiang Stream will be longer; however, it is located in the
reaches below the city, and the functional demands for water quality there are less strict.
80.   Nanhu Lake: After completion of the wastewater interception network, all pollution
from point sources will be sent to the Langdong wastewater treatment plant, and then
discharged to Zhupaichong Stream. The water of Nanhu lake will then be replenished by
stormwater, a cut in volume of 68 %; therefore the water quality will still exceed standards.
Analysis indicates the water level of the lake in normal conditions will remain stable. During
periods of low water, the lake will have replenishment problems. Since the lake will continue
to receive non-point source pollution from stormwater runoff, a problem of eutrophication will
remain.
81.   Potential impacts and planned mitigation of other project components, are shown in
the following Table 2.

Environmental Management
82.   An Environmental Management Unit will be established in the Chaoyang Stream
Comprehensive Treating Project with the following purposes: ensure compliance with
environmental laws and regulations; guarantee the effectiveness of wastewater treatment;
monitor environmental quality of the project and surrounding areas; monitor changes in social
and economic factors to provide a basis for environmental administration and planning for the
city. There will be an environmental administration and an environmental monitoring group.
Special personnel from the Chaoyang Stream Administration and the City Construction
Development Company will be assigned for environmental administration during project
construction. Staff will be two or three persons. A water quality monitoring station will be
established in Jiangnan Waste Water Treating Plant, with four or five staff. The functions of
the environmental administration group will be: to ensure compliance with environmental
regulations; establish administrative rules and checks; develop environmental protection plans;
lead and organize environmental monitoring; carry out environmental education and technical
training for staff; establish rules and regulations for discharge of pollutants and the operation
of environmental protection facilities; coordinate with municipal environmental protection
bureau and answer public information requests. The environmental monitoring group's tasks
will be to develop monitoring plans and rules and regulations of the station; carry out
monitoring of items required for reporting; assist in investigation of environmental accidents;
assist in environmental assessment; assist in tracking social and economic factors; test maintain
and repair instruments used for monitoring.
Enviromnental Monitoring Plan
83.   The environmental monitoring plan will be implemented during the entire construction
phase of the project. Monitoring will include handling, transportation and disposal of dredged
spoils; noise; and ambient air TSP. Monitoring points will be selected in densely populated
areas, or as appropriate for the impact to be monitored. The environmental monitoring plan to
be implemented during the operations phase of the project will be aimed at documenting the
actual impact of the project, as well as the prevention of pollution accidents. Water quality in
the Chaoyang Stream will be monitored in the upper, middle and lower reaches for BOD,
COD and coliforms once each month. Wastewater discharge from the Jiangnan treatment
plant will be monitored for BOD, COD coliforms, nitrogen and phosphorus once each month.
The investment in the environmental monitoring plan will be 0.30 million yuan, used for the
environmental management and monitoring of the project during operation.
Consultation with Affected Groups
84.   Public consultation was solicited in several ways: sessions of questions and answers in
the project areas; distribution of questionnaires; and expert opinion and advice. Radio
reporter's interviews, TV programs and newspapers were also used to gather opinions
suggestions and demands concerning the proposed project. Materials collected were sorted and



Annex 9
142                           Page 18 of 18
classified for analysis. The investigation was carried out in the areas where construction
would take place. Institutions solicited for comment include: Municipal People's Congress,
Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference; the Municipal Government; district
governments and institutions; district people's congress; and dozens of enterprises, schools and
neighborhood committees in the construction areas. Random sampling and questionnaires
were used to gather comment among the people who will be directly affected by the project.
174 questionnaires were distributed and 100 % recovered. About 71 % of the people surveyed
live in the area of the projects, 10 % work in the project areas, and 10 % will be resettled.
The consultation process increased public awareness of the project; 98 % of those surveyed
had heard of the project through mass media or other people. The project had overwhelming
support, with opinions that the project would have positive environmental impact. The persons
to be resettled hoped they would be compensated according to policy and that their living
conditions would be improved, and all expressed a willingness to move.

Monitoring Indicators
Sewerage Management
1.    Primary Indicators. The main objective here is to improve the water quality of
major rivers in Nanning and Guilin. The prevailing water standard for the Lijiang,
Yongjiang and their tributaries (National Standards for Surface Water GB 3838-88),
therefore provides the most direct measure of project impact. Since water pollution is more
acute in the dry season, water quality surveys should be conducted during the months of
November to April.
2.    Secondary indicators. Most secondary indicators (such as BOD, nitrogen levels
and suspended solids) are used to reveal finer improvements in water quality, while others
are used to monitor the utilization of facilities -- such as the operating rate for treatment
plants, interceptors or solid waste and nightsoil facilities. As for the resettlement and
compensation of residents around the Chaoyang Stream, the criteria listed in para 22 of
Annex 8 should be adhered to.
3.    Monitoring Locations. Various criteria are used in the selection of monitoring
locations so as to fully reveal the Project's impact. Therefore, sections of the Yongjiang
and Lijiang river systems that experience comparatively more pollution will be emphasized.
The following monitoring locations would serve this purpose:
(a)   the urban stretches of the Chaoyang stream and the Lijiang,
(b)   the confluence of the Chaoyang stream and Yongjiang at Dakengkou,
(c)   the Taohuajiang tributary and the Rong, Sha and Gui Lakes.
The Chaoyang strearn, currently equivalent to an open sewer, will be cleaned up to a Class
V rating. The Yongjiang should consistently maintain a Class III rating from year 2002
onwards. The Lijiang should attain greater consistency as a Class II river throughout the
year, including the dry season. The Taohuangjiang tributary should also eventually be
upgraded to Class IV.
4.    Secondly, locations are also selected based on physical changes to the environment
as a result of the project. Two critical sites are:
(a)   downstream of the discharge from the new Jiangnan Sewage Treatment
Plant (this plant discharges into the Yongjiang),
(b)   the intake area of the Lingtie Water Filtration Plant, located at the
downstream of Yongjiang's urban stretch. This plant is one of the main
suppliers of treated water to Nanning.

5.        The running and design of the new  Chongkou landfill is critical given that
consolidation of solid waste, unless properly managed, can itself become a source of ground
and surface water contamination. One important area to monitor is the site's treatment and
discharge of recycled leachate. The ultimate leachate discharge must be checked for its
percentage of solids and BOD level. Monitoring sites for underground and surface water
locations will be determined during project appraisal.
6.    The nightsoil management component in Nanning aims to increase the frequency of
septic tank maintenance and expand the service network to cover new units. The volume of
nightsoil and the number of new customers served would be appropriate impact indicators.

Financial and Institutional Indicators for Sewerage Companies
8.      The new  Sewerage Companies in Nanning and Guilin should demonstrate attributes
of financial viability and have a continuous availability of funds for reinvestment. The
importance of these elements are most clearly demonstrated in the case of Nanning. Large
capital expenditures are expected and tariff revenues are destined for debt service and
operating expenses. Given the relative inexperience in operating a large sewerage network,
there is a downside risk of actual operating costs exceeding projections. Also, given the
growing demand for sanitation services, continuous investment (e.g. replacement capital)
needs to be anticipated beyond the project lifespan. A self sustaining Sewerage Company
must be able to sustain such routine expenditure. The following financial indicators will be
used:

9.      Water replenishment facilities, reforestation programs and continuous management
and conservation efforts all help to maintain the Lijiang at an acceptable flowrate. The
following indicators of project impact should be used:

10.    Sugar Refinery Pollution Control. This component's impact will ultimately
translate into better water quality for many of the major rivers in the Region, including the
Lijiang and Yongjiang. Individual sub-projects will be assessed against the following:
(a)     COD reductions in the effluent: target of at least 90%  reduction of COD
discharge from alcohol workshops.
(b)     Reductions in wastewater generation: target of at least 60 %  reduction in
alcohol workshop waste water discharge.
Baseline conditions and expected reductions will be individually established for each sub-
project and are listed in Tables 3, 4 and 5 of Annex 5. Similarly, a set of monitoring
indicators for Industrial Pollution Control is listed in Table 1 of Annex 4.
l1.    EPB Strengthening. Specific indicators were agreed for each of the EPB
institutional strengthening projects. They consist of targets for improved monitoring of
industrial enterprises and water bodies, both as regards frequency and variables analyzed;
and improved reaction times for response to accidents and complaints; and, the introduction
of pollutant mass based waste water discharge permits to replace the present concentration
based system.

Small Area Improvement
12.             The small area improvement component as a whole is targeted to provide
improved environmental benefits to about 110,000 people who are current residents,
estimated one the basis of average cost of about Y 1,300 per person. It is expected that
some 70% of the beneficiaries would have incomes below the city average. It is also
expected that the improvements would induce increase in housing assets and in population,
adding up to 30% to the number of direct beneficiaries. Beyond the above planning targets,
it is not possible at this point to set specific targets for various aspects of the expected
benefits of the component as a whole. One basic indicator of progress could be the number
of beneficiaries:

However, it would also be necessary to measure the following indicators before and after
small area subproject implementation, and use them for planning purposes:
Input Indicators
average service cost per hectare, per household
beneficiary contribution, in amount and as %  of annual income
Output Indicators
number of households and persons benefiting

Impact Indicators
participating households as a percent of households without sanitation for each
city;
amount of housing investment after upgrading;
increase in rents and transactions prices of housing units;
increase in real estate transaction
number of additional persons absorbed by upgraded neighborhoods;
decrease in water-borne diseases among beneficiary population.
