Implementation Completion Report
Republic of Yemen
Basic Education Project
(Credit 2412-RY, Netherlands Grant No. 20254)
Preface
This is an Implementation Completion report (ICR) for the Basic Education Project (BEP) in Yemen, for
which Credit No. 2412-RY in the amount of SDRI 4,500,000 was approved and became effective on May
26, 1993 and a Netherlands Grant No. 20254 of NGL17,500,000 was provided.
The Credit and the associated Grant were closed on December 31, 2000 after a two year extension, except
for category 2 which was extended to April 30, 2001. The following amounts were disbursed as of June
29, 2001: under the Credit: SDR13,675,025.31 (US$18,751,412.15); and under the Netherlands Grant:
NGL17,027,697.36.
The ICR was prepared by Ousmane Diagana, MNSHD, with assistance from Celine Gavach, Emma
Paulette Etori and Hind Tawfeek, and reviewed by Regina Bendokat (Acting Sector Manager, MNSHD),
John Macgregor (Country Coordinator, MNCA3) and Eileen Sullivan (Acting Portfolio Manager,
MNSHD).
This report is based on material available in the project file, and the ICR mission, conducted by Mr.
Ousmane Diagana, was undertaken from May 18-22, 2001, and included the site visit to four governorates
(Dhalla, Lahej, Aden and Ibb). The Borrower prepared a full evaluation of the project's implementation
using the Bank's ICR format. This report is available in the project file. The Borrower provided
comments on the ICR, however the Kingdom of Netherlands (project co-financier) did not provide
comments as of the date of issue of the ICR.

3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.1 Original Objective
According to the Staff Appraisal Report (SAR), the objectives of the project were twofold: (i)
increasing the school enrollment rate of girls in rural areas; and (ii) laying the foundation for improving
the quality of basic education (Grades 1-6).
These objectives were appropriate and highly relevant in the context of a country undergoing
policy to expand primary education of adequate quality, especially for girls in rural areas. The
development objectives of the project were also consistent with IDA's strategy, which recommended that
"universalizing basic education should be extended to rural areas, and equitable access should be
extended to girls; the deterioration in educational quality should be stopped through improvements of
teacher qualification...". The IDA's human resources sector study conducted in January 1992, identified
low female enrollment and limited access to education in rural areas as key issues regarding access and
quality among other important issues, such as teacher shortages, inadequate physical facilities, and
declining educational quality. Finally, the need for a restructured educational system, additional
educational infrastructure, and a greater number of qualified teachers became more evident, as the country
was completing the Unification process and facing massive return of migrant workers and their families
simultaneously during the Gulf crisis.
The project was co-financed by a Netherlands grant TF20254 for a total amount of NLG 17.5
million to support: (i) civil works: NLG 9,740,000; (ii) equipment/furniture and materials: NLG
3,110,000; and (iii) technical assistance and training: NLG 4,100,000. NLG 550,000 were unallocated.
3.2 Revised Objective
The project objectives were not modified since they remained relevant and of high priority. This
was confirmed during the February 1998 mid-term review.
3.3 Original Components
To achieve the development objectives, the project included the following components:
Component 1: Expansion of Education and Access to Girls
Two complementary strategies were adopted to increase girls' access to education:
Classrooms for girls in rural areas would be increased:
-  600 new  classrooms would be constructed and located in about 200 rural
communities spread out over 6-8 governorates;
-  Agreed criteria to select communities were: rural communities of 1,000-2,500
inhabitants, where female enrollments were less than 20%;
- Classrooms would be furnished and would include latrine blocks, at the rate of one
latrine block for every three classrooms; and
-  Funds would be provided by the Project for the maintenance of new classrooms and
furniture.
Recruitment and training of female teachers for project schools:
Provision of funds for a periodic promotional campaign to recruit female teachers; and



4
provision of housing or transportation allowance for female teachers. On a pilot basis,
housing units for female teachers or teaching couples would be constructed and furnished. In
addition, to have women from distant areas enroll in teacher training programs, the project
would finance five boarding hostels, each for 60 female teacher-trainees, an independent
Teacher Training Institute (11l) for females in the governorates of Taiz, Al-Hudeidah, Ibb,
Lahej and Al Maharah.
Component 2: Enhancement of Teacher Effectiveness
A Distance Education Center (DEC) aimed at providing unqualified teachers with qualifications
equivalent to post-secondary teachers, would offer training through multimedia package of printed self-
learning materials, television and video, personal contact sessions during summer vacation and student
counseling. Programs would have to reach 6,000 teachers during the project period.
Component 3: Improvement of Educational Quality
Two inter-related elements were identified:
Curriculum and textbook development: to provide technical assistance and logistical support to
the Education Research and Development Center (ERDC) to implement its ongoing program of
curriculum and textbook development for grades 1-6; and
Training for supervision and testing: to provide technical assistance to the Guidelines and
Evaluation Department to upgrade the competence of its technical staff for teacher supervision,
advisory skills and development of achievement test.
3.4 Revised Components
Components were not revised. However, with the availability of additional funds from the
Netherlands grant, the number of classrooms to be constructed increased from 600 to 1,124, following the
same criteria mentioned above. Also, to be consistent with the new "Teacher Law", the provision of
housing and transportation allowance, as an incentive for recruitment of female teachers, has been
cancelled. In order to improve teacher skills in a more cost-effective way, the provision of audiovisual
equipment has been extended to 20 Regional Teacher Training Institutes (ITTs) and 200 District local
Teacher Training Centers (TTCs).
3.5 Quality at Entry
QAG review was not available at the time of project preparation. Nevertheless, based on the
intensive dialogue between IDA and the Borrower, and based on the fact that the project fell into the
overall strategy widely accepted both by the Govermnent of Yemen (GOY) and IDA, the ICR mission
would rate the quality at entry as satisfactory.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Outcome/achievementofobjective
Satisfactory. In general, the project met its objectives. The project significantly contributed to
increasing access of schooling to children, especially to girls. Although no specific target for girls'
enrollment was set, the expected occupancy of the new classrooms when all six grades levels would be
completed was 24,000 girls. This figure does not reflect the availability of additional funding. An



5
assessment study for the schools of the project indicates that there is a gradual progress in the enrollment
of both boys and girls through the school years 1991/1992 and 1999/2000. According to this study, the
female enrollment rate increased from 34% in 1991/1992 to 43% in 1999/2000 in the Governorates where
the Project intervened. Although detail per district was not provided, the study indicates that in some
areas of Hadramot, Sa'ada, Althaleh and Al-Mahra Governorates, the female enrollment rates passed from
almost zero in 1990/1991 to 35% in 1999/2000. However, while data indicate that enrollments continued
to grow, the percentage of female students enrolled decreases from low grades to high grades. Although a
cohort analysis has not been done, the available data show that in 1999/2000, this percentage was 52% in
the first grade of school projects and only 37% in the sixth grade in the same period. This indicates that
class repetition and dropout of girls in rural areas remain critical issues in the Yemen education system.
Countrywide, the expansion in education has been uneven with large gender gaps: 33% of students in
basic education are girls, and in rural areas, only 28% of school-age girls attend schools.
With respect to laying the foundation for improving quality of education, the project: (i)
successfully completed the development of new curricula and textbooks for grades 1-6; (ii) organized
training sessions to introduce the new curricula to about 350 instructors, 3,000 trainers to train the
teachers and 100,000 teachers; (iii) strengthened the capacity of the Education Research and Development
Center (ERDC) for curriculum research and textbooks writing; and (iv) provided technical assistance and
logistical support to the Evaluation Department for the training of supervisors and researchers to design
and develop new systems to assess student achievement. However, the project was less successful in
enhancing teachers' effectiveness. Although the Distance Education Center (DEC) has been constructed,
furnished and equipped, it has not been operational as the initial approach to establish a
videoconferencing system to have it utilized at 10 governorates ITIs simultaneously did not seem to be
suitable. As proposed, effective interaction would not be possible because of the large number of targeted
trainees. Therefore, the approach has been revised and adequate equipment procured. This equipment
was not delivered at the time of the ICR.
4.2 Outputs by components
(a) Expansion of Educational Access for Females
Satisfactory. The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) identified two complementary strategies to
increase female access to education. First, the number of classrooms available for female education
would be increased by constructing and furnishing new classrooms in rural areas. Second, female staff
would be recruited and provided with incentives.
The first strategy has been successfully implemented. By the end of the project, which received
additional funding from the Netherlands grant, 1,124 new classrooms had been constructed, equipped and
operated before the start of the school year 2000/2001, instead of the 600 new classrooms initially
planned. About 50% of those classrooms are exclusively used for girls' education, while the remaining
classrooms are either used for coeducation or for girls and boys separately. As indicated earlier, the
construction of those classrooms made a significant contribution to the growth of enrollment. (See
figures in Table 1 and Table 2, Section 10, Additional Information). The ICR mission undertook a field
visit and was overall satisfied with the quality of the construction. Problems encountered by communities,
principals, and teachers were the delays in classroom delivery in certain cases and the inadequacy of
school designs in certain areas (e.g., inappropriate ventilation systems, and lack of toilets and boundary
walls). The project preparation team did not go into the designs of the schools which can be an important
factor in attracting girls. The mid-term review mission rightly suggested to add toilets and walls to the
project schools, but this recommendation was implemented only for selected schools. These issues are
being resolved in the new Basic Education Expansion Project (BEEP), which has an access component
including standard designs for school construction taking into account girls' needs.



6
To accelerate enrollment in those areas where female enrollment was less than 20%, the project
designed a second strategy consisting in increasing recruitment of female teachers in project schools in
remote areas. To ensure that female teachers would be available in rural areas, and in turn attract more
students, the additional strategies were: (i) to conduct a community awareness campaign to ensure "Girls
Education"; (ii) to provide housing or transportation allowance for female teachers; and (iii) to build a
limited number of housing units for female teachers. A promotional campaign was conducted in
November and December 1997, using Mosques, public speakers/leaders, and posters on vehicles to
encourage girls in rural areas to enroll in schools. During the IDA's supervision missions, and during this
ICR mission in rural areas, a strong demand for schools was expressed. Parents seemed eager to send
their daughters to schools. However, the recruitment of female teachers did not progress well, so as to
cover the maximum number for project classes. Data gathered show that at the end of the project, the
percentage of female teachers was only about 27% (corresponding to 452 teachers while the SAR
projected 800 female teachers to be recruited at the end of the Project) in Project schools all together.
Provision of housing and transportation allowances as special incentives for female teachers have become
unnecessary with the adoption of a new Teacher Law which allows for payment of "rural allowance" to
all teachers teaching in rural areas.
The construction of five hostels for women teacher trainees in five governorates (Lahej, Taiz,
Hodeidah, Ibb, and Al-Mahrah) has been completed, but four of them have been converted into girls
schools because of the high demand in the area. The fifth one, in Al-Mahrah, is used as a faculty of
education for a teacher training program. In addition, the living quarters for married and unmarried
women teachers, though completed and furnished, are not used for their intended purpose, which was to
provide both "living quarters in a limited number of project schools and [...] an incentive for women
teachers or teaching couples to live and work in rural areas " (SAR, 1992). Based on information provided
during the ICR field trip, women teachers -married or unmarried- preferred to receive allowances in cash
and to have their accommodations in villages where the social life is better compared to living in schools.
Consequently, the living quarters are used as administrative buildings for the principal and the teachers to
satisfy demand for alternative functions.
(b) Enhancement of Teachers Effectiveness
This component is rated marginally satisfactory. Considering the number of under-qualified
primary teachers and professionally unqualified Yemeni teachers, which dramatically increased after the
Gulf War when contracts of foreign teachers (about 32% of the teaching force) ended, this component
was designed as a way to improve the quality of teaching. In addition, a program expected to reach 6,000
teachers during the project period has been designed in order to build on the positive Yemeni experience
with distance education. To implement this program, the project opted for the building of a Distance
Education Center (DEC) to be attached to the continuous In-service Teacher Training Institute (ITTI)
supported by the IDA-funded Secondary Teachers Training Credit (closed in December 1999). Given the
existing potential in terms of buildings that could accommodate the ITT activities, the rationale behind the
construction of the DEC is still unclear.
Also, it is worth mentioning that although the Distance Education Center (DEC) has been
constructed and furnished; there were several difficulties that impeded its timely delivery and, which are
still affecting its use.  Contracted equipment was suspended for technical reasons such as the
inconsistency with technical specifications. Contracts were renegotiated in February 1999, and the
equipment was finally shipped in October 1999, delivered and tested in February 2000, but still not in
use. Although a training director of the DEC and four technical staff had already been appointed, the
additional requirements (i.e., operational procedures and adequate staffing) for an operational center were
not in place. Also, the proposal of the Ministry to establish a video conferencing system for the In-service
Training program starting simultaneously in 10 governorates was inadequate for two reasons: (i) the



7
extremely high costs; and (ii) the lack of effective interaction because of the large number of targeted
trainees.
In response to the request of the minister, a feasible and cost-effective new approach has been
agreed upon, based on the assessment carried out by the Education Development Center (EDC) of DEC's
organizational structure, management and monitoring system. Within this approach, audio visual
equipment will be procured for the Central In-service Teacher Training Institute (IlTlI), 20 Regional
ITlTls and 200 district-level TTCs. This was crucial in providing the basis for the In-service Teacher
Training (I1T) approach in the new operation (BEEP) and providing supplemental materials to that end.
However, it has not yet been implemented because the delivery of equipment procured through UNICEF,
although funded by the Project, has been delayed.
(c) Improvement of the Quality of Education
Satisfactory. In response to the urgent need to improve the quality of learning under the Project,
this component was designed to: (i) accomplish the development of curricula, textbooks and standardized
achievement tests; and (ii) improve the capacity of the Evaluation Department Center (EDC).
To further support the reform of educational service for better quality, the curricula were
reviewed and new versions of textbooks and teacher guides prepared for all six grades, as part of the
technical assistance package through the Education Development Center (EDC). In less than two years,
new curricula for grades 1-6 were completed and started to be used for the 2000/01 school year. With the
assistance of a gender specialist, the new curriculum was reviewed in order to ensure a balanced view of
gender roles in the textbooks. While this achievement was reached with the involvement of key
stakeholders in the taskforce that was put in place, the step of pilot-testing of textbooks in a relatively
small number of schools, before going to full-scale production was by-passed by the Ministry. Despite
the valuable reasons given, the Ministry failed to carefully assess the impact of such a decision, if for any
reason, changes to the content of the textbooks had to be made. This was the case when linguistic and
editing errors were identified in the textbooks for grades 5 and 6, resulting in delays in production and
availability of those textbooks. This situation had a serious impact on the relation between the Consultant
(EDC) and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU). Moreover, since textbooks are not loaned, but given
to the students, new textbooks have to be printed every year. The implications of such a policy in terms of
recurrent costs need to be assessed and adequately budgeted in accordance with the Government
commitment to provide free textbooks to students of basic education.
An orientation training on the new curriculum has been organized in three phases. Under phase I,
350 instructors have been reached to train the trainers. Under phase II, 3,000 trainers to train the teachers
in the field have been trained. In turn, these trainers have trained 100,000 under phase III. The project
also financed the development of training manuals that were used in conjunction with the curriculum
documents to facilitate the training process. The training took place in a timely manner, just before the
introduction of the new curriculum. Evaluation of the two phases was carried out and was overall
positive. The evaluation of the third phase is in progress. However, no in-depth training was envisaged.
This is to be further explored within the current education projects in Yemen. The BEEP and Child
Development projects are supporting in service teacher training.
To enhance its capacity, the project provided technical assistance (as part of the technical
assistance package contracted with the Education Development Center (EDC)) and logistical support to
the Education Research and Development Center (ERDC) to supplement its regular resources for
materials, setting specification for textbooks, recruiting authors, publication and field operations.
Through the same technical assistance package, supervisors and researchers of the Evaluation Department
were respectively trained in teachers supervision and development of achievement tests. However,
teacher supervision activities are still suffering from lack of adequate funding; and standardized

4.5 Institutional development impact
The Institutional Development impact of the project is modest. Responsibilities for coordination
have been delineated among the MOE "regular" services. The construction and furnishing of new
classrooms were undertaken by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), as a department of the Directorate
General for school construction. Within this arrangement, the implementation was very slow between
1993 to 1997, and agreement was reached to establish an independent PIU in May 1997. Thus, the
technical support to the PIU to strengthen its capacity to carry out the procurement and construction
program has not benefited the Directorate General. The project relied on the continuous In-service
Teacher Training Institute (ITTI) to offer distance training through the Distance Education Center (DEC).
However, the DEC was still not in use by the project closing date. The Education Research and
Development Center (ERDC) and Evaluation Department Capacities (EDC) were strengthened in
supervising teachers, influencing development of curricula and textbooks, and setting learning standards
and teaching evaluation criteria.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of government or implementing agency
Socio-political Events
The project identification began in May 1991, exactly one year after the formation of the new
Republic of Yemen as a result of the unification. In this new context, the Government adopted an interim
organization, which ended in December 1992, to deal with the lack of effectiveness and efficiency of the
public services, which brought together two different administrative cultures and two different
educational systems. During the same period, migrant workers and their families massively returned to
their country, as the Gulf War was starting. Also, foreign teachers, who accounted for approximately
32% of the total number of teachers, left the country when their contracts ended. Consequently, demand
for both schools and teachers substantially increased and became the Government's top priority. But, in
1994 a few months after the project became effective, most of the project activities were delayed because
of the civil war in the country.
5.2 Factors generally subject to government control
(a) Project Management and Implementation
By identifying several units as implementing institutions without roles and responsibilities being
explicitly defined, the contribution of these structures to project objectives were not clear. As a result, the
start-up of the project and the execution of its activities were delayed. Significant progress of
implementation only occurred in 1997, when a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) with full responsibility



9
was established. However, the PIU did not have the balanced skills to undertake routine implementation
activities and overall managerial responsibilities to ensure both the monitoring of the expanded project
outputs and the execution of the project activities. For instance, the PIU did not have adequate technical
support from education specialists whereas engineers were available. This is one of main reasons why the
"software" dimensions were implemented with difficulties/delays (teacher training, community
involvement) or not at all (distance education). In retrospect, it would have been better to enhance the
Ministry's "normal" services and have them execute the functions of the PIU and other implementing
institutions. Hence, under the Basic Education Expansion Project, which has been effective since January
2001, there is no PIU and the implementation arrangement is being undertaken by the Ministry.
(b) Community Involvement
The Government was aware of the importance of community involvement in the project design to
ensure a suitable implementation. The task team preparing the project rightly saw the need for community
involvement, but no real structure was set up to help in the implementation. The weakness of the
consultation process, which is reflected by the number of land disputes during the school construction
program, had an impact on the unit cost of construction. In fact, the average cost per square meter for the
Project was US$188, while it was estimated at US$150 for the new Basic Education Expansion Project
for which feedback from communities was taken into consideration. The MOE is building on this
experience to establish capacity at the central and governorate levels to increase community involvement,
especially for school construction and maintenance.
(c) Transfer of Management from PIU to the Coordination Unit (CU)
Streamlining the management of the project in an ongoing IDA funded project was necessary.
Previously, this was seen as the first step to get the MOE to be the executing agency of all IDA funded
projects. In retrospect, it seems that the required action has not been taken to ensure a smooth transition.
The CU, which was responsible for the project management when the PIU functions stopped, had its role
reduced to the monitoring of the closing of all activities. This was reflected on the poor management of
project contracts and the pace of execution of activities during the extended period.
5.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control:
(a) Supervision of the Construction Program
While the overall target of the construction program was met, it is clear that the supervision was
not adequate as needed. There were delays in selected sites and inappropriate use of some facilities
(hostels and dormitories) financed by the project, mainly because of the absence of a system to review
and implement decisions on living arrangements for relocated female teachers.
(b) Monitoring of the Project Implementation
There were no existing project implementation manual, procurement plan or financial plan to
guide the project execution and adjust it with feedback from the implementation context, which explains
the extension of the Project closing date twice. With respect to financial management, internal control
was deficient, because of the lack of both competency in the project structure and a financial operational
manual.

5.4 Costs andfinancing
The IDA credit has been disbursed at 94.6% and the Netherlands grant has been disbursed at
95.2%.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating
Sustainability is highly likely due to the timely preparation and execution of the new project
(BEEP). In that context, the Government has shown great commitment in pursuing in a sustainable
manner the expansion of enrollment and the improvement of the quality of education. To increase access,
the Government is applying policy measures as follows: (i) school site selection based on a school
database established in 1999; (ii) cost-effective school designs using standard designs adapted to local
conditions; and (iii) an efficient use of classrooms, expanding double shift use of classrooms. BEEP,
which is already under execution, is the main vehicle of implementation for these measures. However,
other IDA funded projects, such as Social Fund and Public Works, as well as projects financed by the
Government's budget and other donors are increasingly using the same criteria. In addition, the MOE is
strengthening its function to ensure community involvement in all activities of the Ministry at the central,
govemorates and district levels. Such initiative combined with the new policy for school location and
construction will expand access to education, especially for girls, in a sustainable way.
On the quality side, the Government has introduced new approaches to teaching and learning with
revised criteria. It has also started a cost-effective In-service Teacher Training (ITT) program. However,
a comprehensive strategy for ITT, which is expected to be provided by ERDC, has to be implemented.
This would improve the quality of teaching. Also, there is an ongoing strategy in the context of public
administration reform to improve the deployment of teachers in rural areas and to link remuneration to
performance. This would impact on the quality of education.
Finally, in collaboration with the Ministry of Planning and Development, the MOE is developing
a five-year work plan to guide the development of the sector over this time frame. Although the plan is
still receiving refinement, it is a useful tool, especially if it effectively articulates policy and strategy, for
the sector financing including recurrent costs.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operation
As noted earlier, IDA and the Government reached an agreement on principles governing project
management units in Yemen. Under these principles, the functions of the PIUs would be limited to the
administrative aspects of the project. Accordingly, the MOE has been the first ministry to consolidate
existing operations under the management of one unit, including -and starting with- this project. The
rationale behind this agreement is to emphasize capacity building within the public administration and to
reduce the isolation of the project unit from the line directorates of the ministries.
7. IDA and Borrower Performance
IDA
7.1 Lending
Satisfactory. Five missions visited Yemen from the identification of the Project in May 1991 to the
appraisal in February 1992. The Project was therefore designed in close collaboration with the Borrower.



11
The project preparation team tried to incorporate lessons learned from the previous project into the new
project design. However, the institutional assessment including the procurement capacity assessment was
missing.
7.2 Supervision
Satisfactory. Although not unusual, there have been four task managers during the life of the project.
Regular supervision missions were conducted. Likewise, the mid-term review was undertaken as planned.
Transferring supervision responsibilities to the resident mission has allowed the dialogue with the
Borrower and the field office of the co-financier to be more effective. However, the skills mix in the
supervision missions were not always adequate. In particular, financial management and procurement
specialists could have been involved in a more systematic manner. Considering the weakness at the local
level in these specific areas, more attention should have been given to ensure a proper design of
implementation plan and its monitoring by qualified and more available staff. Moreover, the IDA
supervision could have done better in supervising the Netherlands Trust Fund. Until 1997, the team
focused exclusively on the Credit.
7.3 Overall IDA performance
IDA's perfonnance is rated satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation
Satisfactory. Participation was strong, effective and enthusiastic during all the project design
process.
7.5 Government implementation performance
Satisfactory. Despite a slow beginning essentially due to a lack of leadership in the overall
orientation at the ministry level, progress picked up when a new Minister came on board in 1996-1997.
This change in management at the top level allowed positive adjustments (i.e., revision of role of PIU,
cancellation of transportation and housing law in light of a more efficient Teacher Law and revision of
teacher training approach). The highly visible commitment of the Minister of Education was crucial in
improving enrollment.
7.6 Implementing Agency
Marginally Satisfactory. Even though the skills mix might have been better, the overall
administration of the project was adequate. Progress was regularly reported, especially when the PIU
functions were reviewed in May 1997. Project accounts were audited and reports shared with IDA. The
main shortcomings were the deficits of internal control and monitoring of activities resulting from the
lack of competencies in these areas. In retrospect, the implementation agencies' performance could have
been assessed following these periods: (1) 1993-1996, when the roles between the coordinating structure
and implementation entities were overlapping and led to un-clarity; (2) 1997-1999, when a huge progress
was achieved with a fully responsible PIU and a highly committed Minister; and (3) 2000-closing date,
when the CU's role as the new implementing agency was to monitor all closing activities. The CU was no
longer responsible for the viability of the Project achievements within the sector long-term strategy.



12
7.7 Overall Borrower performance
Satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The main lessons learned in this project are:
Implementation Responsibilities. Terms of references with detailed roles and responsibilities
and expected outcomes for all administrative entities involved in the project implementation need
to be developed, discussed and agreed upon prior to Project effectiveness. Periodic reviews on
tasks performed and implementation progress are recommended with subsequent issuance report
for the Borrower representative and funding agencies consideration.
Procurement Capacity Assessment. Procurement activities within the Project were important
and wide, ranging from civil works to procurement of goods and consultant services. Knowing
weaknesses of the Directorate General of the MOE and the lack of capacities in that area in
Yemen, a procurement capacity assessment should be carried out as part of the appraisal or prior
to the effectiveness. This would help address specific issues and fill the gap in view of a timely
implementation of activities.
Community Involvement. Communities should be involved at the early stage of the Project,
through an adequate structure to assist in planning, supporting and implementing their roles and
responsibilities. In the case of Yemen, where the communities have an important role in the use
of land and have significant potential to contribute to school construction and maintenance in a
cost-effective way, this would avoid delays in site selection and would reduce the unit cost. It
would also ensure the sustainability of the project achievement.
Technical Assistance.  Technical assistance needs should be defined on the basis of a
preliminary institutional assessment. The required terms of reference for the agreed TA should
be prepared, costed and its time frame defined as priority by the Borrower.
Monitoring and Evaluation. To assess the impact of the project interventions and the
achievement of development objective, clear and monitoring indicators should be developed and
used by the client.
Teachers Supervision. Adequate funding for teachers supervision should be provided through
the national budget.

At the time of Appraisal, the Netherlands contribution was not available yet. However, the Grant
Agreement No. 20254 was signed on December 6, 1994, for a total amount of NGL 17.5 million
(equivalent to USM$8.5), within the framework of the co-financing agreement between the Minister of
Planning and Development and IDA dated May 16, 1984. The Development Credit Agreement was
amended on December 6, 1994, to reflect the co-financing. Given the importance of this contribution in
the implementation of the Project, it is important that the Netherlands Trust Fund be recorded in the above
table.

Annex 8. Government's Contribution
1.1 Background
The Basic Education Project (BEP) has been prepared during the early 1990s. Educational
inequalities and education in rural areas have always been of great concern to BEP planners, as the Staff
Appraisal Report (SAR) indicates. The Gulf crisis and the return of Yemeni emigrants have made the
economic situation much worse and thereby adding to the educational problem of which Yemen suffers
from.
During the spring of 1991, a World Bank mission initiated the dialogue with the Ministry of.
Education and the project was identified. The World Bank, furthermore, conducted four successive visits
to Yemen; the first two visits took place between April and September 1991; the third was in November
1991 for project pre-appraisal and the fourth was conducted in January/February 1992, when the BEP was
appraised.
However, it must be admitted that efforts made to improve the underdeveloped system of
education in Yemen were already in existence before the BEP. That itself was a motive to keep on with
the Basic Education Project.
School buildings were inadequate and unable to assimilate all children of the compulsory
education age group, especially in the rural and remote parts of the country. Female educational
conditions were even more difficult. Poor living conditions, besides negative attitudes towards females
might have contributed to such a situation. Most of the basic education teachers, especially those of
grades 1-6, are either poorly qualified or have no qualifications at all.
Moreover, the state's tendency towards maintaining its decentralization strategy has accelerated
the efforts to ensure the right of the Yemeni individual to obtain at least a minimum level of education. As
a consequence, the more deprived social groups have become first priority for BEP.
As the SAR and other relevant documents show, the ultimate objective for the BEP is to reinforce
the efforts exerted by MOE sectors to achieve universalization of basic education, at least in the first two-
thirds of the basic education cycle, which last for nine years.
In addition, the project was initiated with what economists call "a cost effective approach".
Therefore, the project's designers are expected to attain the best possible outcomes with the least possible
resources.
Furthermore, the present project administration and organization at its initial stages "was
designed in a management structure that would develop close collaboration and coordination among
implementing institutions and delegate decision-making to the lowest possible level" (original report p.3).
As a consequence, a special higher committee was formed to administer, coordinate and organize BEP's
different activities. This committee is called the Basic Education Coordination Committee (BECC). It is
chaired by the Vice Minister with the membership of: the minister's deputies of MOE sectors; Director
General of the Education Research and Development Center and the General Director of the Projects
Implementation Unit (PIU).
1.2 Proiect Obiectives
Based on the Project document (SAR), the general objectives of this Project are:



25
a) Increasing females' participation rate in education, as well as, laying the foundation of
basic education quality in rural areas
b) Reinforcing teachers' effectiveness
c) Improving the quality of education through: curricula and textbooks development;
improving student evaluation mechanism; and institutional capacity-building
development.
1.3 Project ComDonents
To achieve the objectives of this project, three inter-related components have been identified.
These are:
1.3.1 Rural girls education;
1.3.2 Effectiveness of the basic education teacher; and
1.3.3 Quality of education
1. 3.1 Rural Girls Education
This component seeks to raise the level of rural girls' participation in education and attempts to
achieve some equity between their share and that of males in such a service. The right to education is as
stated in the education law ensured for all members of society and they are all equal in this respect.
However, owing to the dominance of some negative attitudes shown toward females the actual practice
does not, in many cases, reflect the basic theoretical principles implied in documents and political
statements.
The project in hand, however has adopted two strategies to fulfill main objectives of this
component. The first is related to the construction of totally new schools or additional classrooms to be
part of existing schools. While the second, is attached to the preparation or recruitment of female teachers
who are expected to staff newly constructed classrooms in both types of schools. Moreover, the project
was meant to provide female teachers trainees with material and immaterial incentives; some of those
incentives are transportation allowances and regular monthly stipends as well as boarding and hostel
facilities for both trainees and female teachers.
To ensure a more equitable distribution of such services among the most deprived regions, the
BEP has developed three objectives measures for site selections. They are as follows:
-  Where no schools are available at all, or where the existing school is highly
inadequate to absorb the growing number of 6-15 age group children.
-  Where co-education takes place in school with small-size classrooms that make
overcrowding evident, consequently, preventing girls from enrolling.
-  Wherever, the local community shows readiness to donate land, provide voluntary
labor and show interest in maintaining the school.
This component has indirectly aimed at reducing overcrowding that reflects the low government
spending on the construction of new schools or the failure to keep space with the growing social demand
for education. Furthermore, the last criterion emphasizes local communities; participation in taking part of
the responsibility for education. This also reinforces decentralization orientation and encourages local
communities to provide essential services for girls as the most deprived social group of Yemeni society.



26
1.3.2 Teachers' Effectiveness
The basic education teacher's effectiveness is, as stated earlier, weak and his/her educational
qualification low, especially after the expansion in building new schools. The BEP has not come about
from a void; rather it has come to reinforce the accumulated efforts in the field of education. The SAR
points out that the BEP "... has provided increment assistance to the Yemen's ongoing program of school
construction and has improved educational qualitv through staff, curriculum and instructional
development.
As such, this component is related to the effectiveness and adequacy of the Yemeni teacher who
is the center element of the educational process. MOE ongoing and successive efforts have led to the
initiation of an educational strategy which has been considered of high economic feasibility. This is called
"distance education"; distance education aims at upgrading qualification of the basic education teachers
(grades 1-6), along with providing them with in-service training courses. This is to be achieved through
three complementary means: self-learning; micro-face to face micro teaching sessions; and teaching
practice in the school context.
1.3.3 Oualitv of Education
The title of this component is rather vague and inaccurate. This is because the concept of quality
includes all material and human inputs that affect the educational process outputs (equipment, civil works,
technical assistance,...etc.). However, referring to the SAR and actual practice of the project, one finds
that this component includes three sub-components. First, the institutional capacity building activities,
such as printing press equipment that have been furnished to meet Textbooks' Printing Corporation.
Moreover, there are the textbooks' references and periodicals provided to the Education Research and
Development Centre (ERDC), as well as the technical assistance provided for the training of school
supervisors, headmasters and headmistresses and other relevant cadre in the Guidance and Curriculum
Sector.
The second sub-component concentrated on integrating Yemeni child's ideological and cultural
perception. That was because a typical Yemeni child has been brought up under two different ideologies,
during the existence of the two political regimes that dominated Yemen before reunification. Furthermore
this component attempted to mitigate negative consequences of old curricula shortcomings, so as to make
them more adequate in form and content, yet more appropriate and adaptable to modem educational
practices. The sex-biased perception of the curriculum is one of the most crucial issues in this respect.
However, the new textbooks and accompanying teachers' guides developed through the BEP have
properly dealt with such an issue.
The third sub-component deals with the creation of a mechanism for the assessment of students'
school achievement. Such an ideal-type mechanism is, as expected, to assist decision makers select the
best intakes for education university colleges.
2. Achievements and Outputs
2.1 Rural Girls' Participation in Education
Statistical data for 1992 indicated that the rural girls enrollment rate in basic education is very
low in Yemen. As for the Project working areas, the ratio was 34% in 1992; by 1999/2000 females
enrolment rate was 43%.



27
The BEP adopted two complemented strategies to achieve the objectives of this component; the
main achievements are:
a) During the life span of the Project, 1,124 additional classrooms were constructed at an
overall cost of US$11.5 million. This achievement exceeds what was previously planned.
Which was only 600 classrooms. The increase percentage was almost 187.3%. Among
the most prominent factors that account for this high achievement is the fact that most of
the Netherlands grant, amounting to some US$8,000,000, was utilized and invested to
meet the objective of this component
b) The Project undertook the completion of five boarding schools for female students,
whose enrollment in the rural teacher training institutes was anticipated, in addition to ten
hostels for rural female teachers. All of these were built nearby BEP schools, and were
meant to be experimental; the total cost of which is US$1.8 million.
c) 88,000 school seats were procured during the life span of the Project, out of which 40,000
were distributed to the Project schools at an overall cost of US$1.6 million. The
remainder was distributed to cover the needs of other schools, some of which are located
in the centers of major cities. 55% of the total number of project seats was improperly
distributed. However, the cost of school seats amounted to US$2.5 million.
d) A total of 1,124 classrooms at the Project schools were furnished with forty thousand
school seats.
e) A media campaign was undertaken in the Project areas to make parents and the
communities aware of the importance of girls education and its impact on the individual,
the family, and society development. The overall cost of that campaign amounted to
US$0.04 million.
f) A preliminary survey was undertaken to verify the possibility of having secondary school
female graduates interested in joining the teaching profession so as to staff newly
constructed classrooms in project targeted regions. The project has chosen some
candidates for such a purpose, but no further action was taken by concerned agencies
regarding the procedures for recruiting them.
g) A local consultant was contracted to undertake an assessment study regarding the level of
component achievement. The study has shown positive results in this regard. Females'
e*nrollment rate in some areas was zero or around that and by the end of the Project stood
at between 30% - 35%.
Despite the fact that females in some of the rural areas are still less represented as against males,
yet the performance of this component is to some extent satisfactory from the viewpoint of Project
implementers.
2.2 Teacher's Effectiveness
Working towards achieving the objectives of this component, the project achieved the following
outputs:
*  Construction of the main premises of the Distance Teaching Institute in Sana'a the Capital. This
institute is to upgrade teacher qualifications and provide them with in-service training, which are
to improve their performance and living standard.
*  The project equipped the institute with a high-tech studio to produce a package of teaching
materials of relevant audiovisual aids. Despite the delay in tender's procedures, the studio has
finally been put in place and has been tested in February 2000.
*  A general director and four assistants in the field of distance education and teaching techniques
were appointed for the Institute. It is expected that the DEC will be linked to the existing in-



28
service training institutes under the responsibility of the Deputy Minister for the Guidance and
Curriculum Sector.
*  Currently, the Institute does not function according to the designed plan, owing to the absence of
the conditions necessary for its operation. Among these is the failure to appoint a qualified
specialist capable of dealing with the high-tech studio equipment. In addition, there is the limited
operation budget, absence of a leadership that is familiar with the educational purposes of the
Institute, and the inability to create a technical strategy of an appropriate financial cost responsive
to the limited resources of the country.
*  In response to the request of the Minister, a consultant was contracted to verify economic
feasibility of adopting the audio-conference methodology to have the Distance Education Institute
implement the relevant educational programs. The Project had to make contracts with more than.
one international consultant to verify the feasibility of such a methodology. However, the results
of the two studies recommended the impracticality of such a strategy under the conditions of the
Republic of Yemen. These conditions are characterized by the unavailability of appropriate
infrastructure in the rural regions. Furthermore, the adoption of such a methodology will
necessarily lead to the Project's deviation from its policy of adopting more cost-effective
methodologies.
*  As the Institute is still not functioning, the in-service teacher training institute under the Guidance
and Curriculum Sector is undertaking the task. There are 21 in-service teacher training institutes
(ITIs ) in the country, one of which is located in Sana'a the capital. The annual average number of
trained teachers is around 500 male and female teachers. The courses are sometimes conducted at
the Central Institute located in Sana'a the capital, which has an intake capacity of 40 female and
120 male trainees.
-  A few months before the closure of the Project, the Ministry leadership and the donor
headquarters agreed to equip 200 centers in some districts of the Republic with computers and
audio-visual equipment necessary for the reception of training programs transmitted through the
Yemen Satellite Channel. At the time of the writing of this report, the Coordination Unit, to
whom affairs of the Project are assigned, had not received the required equipment whose cost has
already been paid to UNICEF as the contractor of this task appointed according to the World
Bank suggestion.
2.3 Outputs of Education Ouality Component
This component is comprised of three inter-related and complemented sub-components directed
towards the tackling of the quality aspects of the educational process. The first sub-component is
concerned with the development of the institutional structure of the various sectors of the Ministry. The
second sub-component relates to the upgrading and modernization of the study curricula and textbooks
for the first six grades of the basic education stage composed of nine grades. The third sub-component
concentrates on the standard of student achievement of this stage. Most activities of this major component
are included in the contract concluded with the Education Development Center at a total cost of US$2.3
million. The general standard of the performance of this component, despite some reservations, which are
taken up in some detail in the next item of this report, are without a doubt satisfactory.
2.3.1 Curricula
The new syllabi represented by 70 textbooks and accompanying teachers' manuals for each of the
six years have already been put into effect. These have been distributed to all students in the Republic
starting with the 2000/2001 academic year with a somewhat better competence than previous academic
years. In addition, familiarization and training courses were conducted over three stages in the following
manner:



29
(a)    Fifty curriculum-design specialists trained 300 supervisors, most of whom are training tutors
in the in-service training institutes (ITIs). The course was conducted at the premises of the
Higher In-service Training Institute.
(b)    The above mentioned three hundred supervisors undertook the training of 17,000 senior
teachers and school supervisors at the governorate level. The Ministry contributed to the cost
of conducting this course in cooperation with the Education Development Center within the
context of the condition set out in the contract signed with the Project.
(c)    The Ministry leadership considered it important that such a familiarization course should be
generalized to the largest number of teachers of relevant grades. It proposed the addition of a
third stage not provided for in the plan of this component. After the Bank's approval, the
course was conducted with funds saved from the overall value of the credit and beyond
Education Development Center (EDC) agreed upon Terms of Reference. This process was
conducted at the level of the districts and targeted the training of 100,000 teachers throughout
the governorates of the Republic.
2.3.2 Institutional Capacitv BuildinE
Within this sub-component, the Project has organized special training courses for the technical
and administrative cadre of Guidance, Education Sectors, and the Central In-service Training Institutes.
This training was conducted in Egypt and Jordan. The achievement exceeded what was planned, owing to
a cut in the training duration period enabling the largest number possible of relevant cadres to be trained.
23.3 Regulation of Model Mechanism for Testing' SchoolAchievement
The examinations system in the Republic of Yemen is partial, and non-systematic. The Project
aimed at the development of this sub-component to create a standard mechanism that enables teachers to
carry out more comprehensive tests to reflect the level of students' school achievement.
A team from the Guidance Sector and the Distance Education Institute was chosen to work in
collaboration to develop such a mechanism. The team included those who had been sent abroad on short
courses to acquire knowledge and skills relevant to the development of examinations and question items.
The team prepared 200 questions for each textbook/study assignment with the purpose of using these in
the internal and external school examinations. Field visits to Sana'a, Amran, Taiz, Aden, Al-Hodaida
governorates were conducted. The study was limited to the fourth and sixth grades. To that then were
added measures for completion of the task. This was not done under the justification that the
examinations system is not comprehensive or systematic. Perhaps, there are other unknown reasons as
well. Within the context of this activity, a contract was also concluded with the Yemensoft Organization
to develop some software programs that serve this purpose.
3. Basic Education Proiect in the Balance
The report in this section is to concentrate on BEP's experience strengths and weaknesses,
beginning with the appearance of the idea until the moment of closure.
3.1 Project Idea and Planning
When one reflects on the historic turning point lived by the Yemeni Unity state, one realizes that
the idea of the Project was positive. It was an incentive for the recently established Republic of Yemen to
aspire to a better future under the economic conditions featured with frustration imposed by objective
conditions that were not under its control. At the same time, the process of determining the needs and
operations accompanying and preceding the implementation of the Project was fast and confusing. It did



30
not allow enough opportunity for the participation of education leaderships and the executive technical
cadres in determining its features, objectives and components. Thus, those who possessed a critical view
on the so-called 'turning key projects", where not completely satisfied with the BEP's design. This is
supported by, for example, the sub-components concerned with upgrading the girls' participation in
education. It was argued that project components ignored the nature of Yemen's cultural background in
which it was to be implemented. Consequently, they consider the assumptions on the basis of which the
Project was formulated as unrealistic. On the other hand, the granting of priority to the social groups most
deprived from essential services is considered a positive advantage for the Basic Education Project, even
if it has been taken from a theoretical point of view.
3.2 Proiect Manarement and Or,anization
In its original plan, the task of management was assigned to a committee headed by the Vice
Minister and the membership of the Deputy Ministers of the Ministry's sectors, in addition to the general
director of the Project Implementation Unit and the Education Research and Development Center. This
committee was named, the Basic Education Co-ordination Committee, (BECC). Its tasks were
represented in the overall administration issues and primary decisions. Executive activities would be
carried out by the Ministry structure, each in its field of competence. Reports on the progress of work
proved from actual practice that the activities were hindered and the achievements were less than the
anticipated level. Perhaps, the most important reasons for that were the following:
-  The mechanism for distribution of ministerial portfolios and leadership responsibilities following
the country's unification was subject to political balance and the principle of partnership. This
strategy had a negative impact on the implementation of the various education and development
activities, be their funding from internal or external sources.
*  Absence of actual participation in the preparation process weakened the zeal of the members of
that committee for implementing activities with the required effectiveness.
*  The coordination committee constituted of those holding executive positions were charged with
tasks exceeding their capabilities. No regard was given to infusing the committee with capable
full-time members.
* During the era of this committee, most of the Project's operation costs were from the government
contribution. Due to the meager financial allocations of the Ministry, the Project was unable to
meet operational needs with the required competence.
Starting in May 1997 and during the final years of the Project's life span and before the project's
hold up, the Bank mission in coordination with its counterparts from the ministerial leadership saw it as
essential that an independent unit should be created for the Project management. There was a noticeable
rise in clear achievements. During the mid-term review mission's visit in May 1998 it directed a letter of
thanks and appreciation to the new unit for its good performance and for expediting the achievement
process. The flexibility, which marked the Project's ability to amend the project management method
after commencing implementation is considered to a great degree, a positive advantage.
3.3 Rural Girls' Education Component
The concentration on girls education out of the consideration that they were less lucky in
obtaining the various primary services when compared with males was a positive aspect in granting
priority to the more needy social groups. This is particularly true when we realize that the attention
directed to the rural areas through the investments of the Netherlands assistance in building additional
classrooms in the various areas of the project's activity is also considered a positive advantage.



31
Through a study of the closure report and the various relevant documents, one finds oneself
compelled to conclude that rural girls were not the essential foundation of the activities that were carried
out within the context of this component, as the SAR document may have suggested. The boarding
sections built were transformed into basic education schools and the female teachers' hostels were used
for other purposes. The project approved 88,000 school seats for the project. Only 40,000 seats were
distributed to cover the project's needs, while the remainder was distributed to satisfy the interest of other
groups.
3.4 Reinforcement of the Teacher's Competence Component
Upgrading the qualifications of rural basic education teachers and providing them with in-service
training courses is an urgent need. MOE leadership and donors headquarters representatives have been
looking into the most available cost-effective approaches to adopt in this regard. Distance education has
been seen as a more pragmatic approach. Nevertheless, the construction of the Distance Education
Institute premises, its equipment and furniture and the provision of a studio for the preparation of
educational programs and related educational audio-visual aids without activating it with the required
personal competence is a waste, especially as the specialist technical cadres are not available at present.
Added to that, the adoption of modem equipment (computers, video editing machines, presentation
screens, etc.) for 200 centers in districts most of which lack essential services including electricity
represents a sort of irregularity. If such a measure had been adopted for the governorates and regular and
periodic courses conducted to which the districts' teachers were invited the matter would have been better
dealt with, and with greater saving as there would be 20 central govemorates institutions only instead of
200 centers that lack primary infrastructure.
3.5 Oualitv of Education Component
Among the most important achievements of this component in particular and the project in
general is the upgrading and development of the curricula of the lower part of the basic education stage
(grades 1-6) and that for the following reasons:
1. This came about at the appropriate time with the founding of the Yemeni unity, which came
about with the merging of two ideologically and culturally disparate entities. As such, it was
imperative that the Yemeni child's and society's perception must be integrated.
2. The curricula development process was positive in that it depended on Yemeni qualified
specialist cadres (the Research Center, the Ministry of Education, the Faculty of Education at
Sana'a University). As mentioned earlier, the Curriculum Team undertook authorship of 70
textbooks and the accompanying teachers' manuals. This process helped the development of an
institutional building at the Ministry, the university and the research center, even if in an indirect
manner.
3. The shortcoming apparent in this sub-component is the delay of disbursement of the entitlements
of the team participating in the development of the curriculum. Moreover MOE has also
generalized the new curricula and distributed them without a trial period.
3.6 Technical Assistance Contracts
The contract with the Education Development Center received the lion's share of the activities of
the third component of the project. It appeared to shoulder a burden that surpassed its capacity. The
contract was amended and the agreement extended. During the life span of the contract problems surfaced
and some activities were not completed until the closure of the Project. These issues indicate that the
monopolization of activities may reduce productivity and effective performance. They are consequently



32
considered to be among the negative aspects of the Project, especially as these are long-term consultant
services.
3.7 Determination of Civil Works Sites and Size of Classrooms
The absence of a precise school map leads to the weakening of the authority of those handling the
project in preventing duplication and repetition of projects. This is especially true in the absence of
coordination between the quarters concerned with determination of the size of the classrooms built under
the Education Project plan. The classrooms were of lesser area when compared with international norms.
4. Assessment of Borrower and World Bank Performance
4.1 World Bank Performance
The Bank had a positive effect on the implementation of BEP. This had started earlier through the
active involvement of IDA staff during the identification and preparation phase of the project. During the
project implementation regular supervisory missions visited the country. These were sometimes
constrained by the security situation, particularly during the 1994 secessionist war. Some supervisory
missions carried out field visits to some project sites, such as the visits to some schools, hostels and the
DEC in October 1999. Such supervisory visits contributed greatly to the solving of many implementation
issues and problems.
IDA was also actively involved in the preparation of the Country Portfolio Performance Review
(CPPR), as well as the Sector Portfolio Performance Review (SPPR) carried out during the life span of
the Project. For instance, three CPPRs were carried out during the project's life span on May 28 to June 5
1995, October 25 - 30 1996 and December 13 - 15 1998.
The establishment of the World Bank Country Management Unit in 1995 made IDA assistance
available to the Ministry of Education in addressing some financial and administrative issues. An example
of IDA involvement in BEP implementation is the review of the international experience in video
conferencing when the Ministry of Education requested IDA to fund a video-conferencing system for in-
service teacher training.
The IDA mid-term review mission in February 1998 participated actively in reviewing BEP
progress and resolving implementation issues. The mid-term review recommended the BEP extension,
adding boundary walls, as well as sanitary facilities to project classes and conversion of the four female
students' hostels into basic education schools for girls.
4.2 Borrower Performance
The overall performance of the government in relation to the BEP preparation and
implementation is satisfactory. The Government of Yemen has exhibited strong support to improve
implementation performance of IDA financed projects, including the BEP. Compliance with all credit
covenants has been observed, with the exception of those that have been rendered irrelevant in the context
of the new dialogue between IDA and MOE, such as providing incentives for female students. This was
considered necessary given the generic "rural incentives" provided under the new Teacher Law.
The Ministry of Education/Project Implementation Unit (MOE/PIU) submitted regular progress
reports since the establishment of the new BEP/PIU in 1997. Audit reports were also submitted in a
regular manner.

5. Lessons Learned from the Experience:
*  It is preferable that the project management should include some of those who participated in its
preparation.
*  Yemenization of cadres in similar development and education projects is an essential element in
enabling project success.
*  Long-term technical assistance contracts concluded with the project and for various activities
have more disadvantages than advantages. Short-term low cost contracts for partial tasks are of
greater effectiveness.
*  The project's realism and its regard for the cultural background within the context of potentials,
natural and human resources are primary conditions for successful implementation. Ready.
prescriptions carry within them their own demise conditions.
*  Incentives, simplification of measures and the building of strong relations of co-ordination and
co-operation among the parties concerned with implementation, along with the allocation of an
adequate operations budget is essential for expediting implementation and improving
performance. The cost of a classroom during different periods of the project life span reinforces
this fact (see the financial report).
*  Planning based on authenticity and scientific measures when arranging priorities is reflected on
the reality of actual practice and the final outputs (rural girls education component is a witness
thereto).
D  Equitable distribution of education services between the govemorates and districts is more
realistic in the existence of a school map, which is the most fundamental infrastructure base for
realizing a more just distribution of essential services in the governorates of the Republic.
* There are other Government authorities and Ministries which are involved in the project
implementation. They are mostly unaware of the project content which cause delays in project
implementation.
Conclusion:
The BEP has been developed to meet a twofold objective. On the one hand, to increase the rate of
rural females participation in education, and to improve the quality of education at large on the other. The
project performance has been judged satisfactory. Nevertheless, it has encountered several number of
constraints and difficulties that have been concluded as lessons learned.
