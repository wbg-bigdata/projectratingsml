MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA FOR A
TREE CROPS PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Federal Republic of Nigeria for US$106.0 million is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be for 22 years, including seven years
of grace, at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.        Background:  Tree crops can play an important role in Nigeria's
economy, but substantial investments are needed to revive and expand this
subsector. Rubber, cocoa and oil palm, were a principal source of export
earnings prior to the oil boom of the 1970s. Since then, exports have
declined mainly because of the overvalued Naira, high labor costs and the
inadequate prices set by the Commodity Boards. However, the Structural
Adjustment Program (SAP), begun in 1986, has significantly improved the
incentive framework in the Nigerian economy. The changes in trade policy,
exchange rate reform and the abolition of the Commodity Boards have had a
positive impact on tree crop exports and import substitutes. Nigeria has a
strong comparative advantage in the production of rubber and cocoa for
exports, and palm oil for domestic consumption, but exploitation of this
advantage requires additional processing capacity, new plantings and
related support services. Natural conditions are favorable for oil palm;
for cocoa and rubber, they are excellent. However, the prolonged period of
disincentives prior to the SAP, coupled with poor management, has led to
low crop yields and low efficiencies in processing. To raise yields and
processing efficiencies, substantial investments are required which in the
private sector are constrained by the lack of available medium- to
long-term credit.
3.        Rationale for IBRD Involvement:  An important objective of the
Bank's strategy in Nigeria is to promote supply response for activities in
which Nigeria has a comparative advantage. An important approach within
the strategy is to promote private sector involvement in the supply
response.  Given the supportive framework of the SAP and the liberalization
undertaken tree crop development has potential and is timely. Bank
involvement would facilitate investments by enabling the Federal Government
of Nigeria and State Governments to take the foreign exchange risk;
strengthen technical expertise and managerial skills essential for
successful investments in modern technology and promote private sector
involvement in oil palm and rubber subsectors.
4.        Project Objectives:  The project would increase production and
productivity, through investments in several areas in the oil palm and
rubber subsectors, with cocoa being covered by the proposed MSADP III
project. The focus is on oil palm. In the shurt and medium terms,
expanded modern processing capacity will enable Nigeria to increase
exploitation of its extensive supply of fruits from wild palm groves and



the higher-yielding Teneras planted in recent years. In the longer terr,
there would be increaaed fruit and oil from the project-sponsored
high-yielding Tenera plantings and new mills. Costs of production would
gradually fall as extraction efficiencies due to modern mills rise and as
yields due to the Tenera plantings increase. For rubber, the project would
expand processing capacity, currently the main short-term constraint to
increasing quantity and quality of production. To complement and support
its production objectives, the project would strengthen government
technical expertise and promote competent private sector management.
5.        Project Description:  The main components are: (i) Public sector
investments in oil palm planting, processing and research, essentially to
support smallholder development and efficiency improvements in private
milling; (ii) Private sector investments in constructing and rehabilitating
the processing capacity in palm oil ant' rubber, and in parastatals with
suitable privatization plans; (iii) Support activities for public and
private institutions involved. The oil palm planting program would involve
monocropping on 8,000 ha of nucleus estate, 9,000 ha of smallholdings, and
17,500 ha of smallholder mixed-cropping. Two 20 ton/hr mills would be
constructed, one at Ukwa and t"e second at Ekor, to process oil palm fruits
from the monocrop plantings. 5he research component supports NIFOR, the
Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research. Private sector investments,
including those of eligible parastatals under privatization, will be
financed as Processing Subprojects (PS) through participating commercial
and merchant banks (PBs) to create an estimated processing capacity of 115
tons/hr for oil palm fruits and 50 tons/day for rubber plus rehabilitate 30
tons/day of rubber milling capacity. The support activities are to
strengthen technical expertise, managerial competence and supervisory
capacity in the public sector; MEU, Adapalm Nigeria Ltd., and Akwapalm
Ltd.; and in the private sector: the PBs and palm oil mill operations
staff. The overall project yields an ERR of 21 percent, and the economic
returns on the processing subprojects range from 18-60 percent.
6.        The total project cost is estimated at US$160.0 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of US$105.0 million (66
percent). A breakdown of costs and financing plan are shown in Schedule A.
Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursement, as well as the
disbursement schedule are given in Schedule B. A timetable of key project
processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Nigeria are
given in Schedules C and D respectively. Two maps of Nigeria are also
attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 7429-UNI, dated February 28,
1989, is being distributed separately.
7.        Actions to be Agreed:  Key actions are (i) that FGN for a margin
assumes the foreign exchange risk in the case of private borrowers who opt
to incur liability in Naira for the PS; (ii) that the Imo and Akwa-Ibom
State Governments for a margin assume the foreign exchange risk for the
cost of Smallholder Development Units; (iii) that FDARD/MEU, Adapalm,
Akwapalm, and the PBs put in place the technical expertise and managerial
skills needed for undertaking the investments; (iv) FGN, Imo and Akwa-Ibom
State Governments do not provide budgetary support to their parastatal



plantations, except for minority interest capitalization or financial
restructuring in connection with the divestiture of any state owned
enterprise to the private sector; (v) public sector companies in oil palm
and rubber seeking access to PS financing to enter into suitable management
contracts with qualified firms and to prepare privatization plans
satisfactory to the PBs and to the Bank; (vi) NIFOR sells its oil palm seed
at full cost from 1990; and (vii) state government nurseries sell oil palm
seedlings at full cost after 1991. Conditions of effectiveness include:
(a) signing of management contract by Adapalm and Akwapalm; (b) execution
of subsidiary loan agreements by FGN with Imo and Akwa Ibom State
Governments; and (c) initial deposit in project accounts by participating
state governments. Additionally, signing of subsidiary loan agreements
between the Imo and Akwa Ibom State Governments and Adapalm and Akwapalm
respectively, and between FGN and PBs would be amongst the several
conditions of disbursements.
8.        Justification and Risks:  The project would be a timely
intervention to support the Government's objectives by increasing scale and
efficiency of production in palm oil and rubber, and by increasing foreign
exchange earnings. In both commodities, Nigeria has a strong comparative
advantage: for palm oil as an import substitute and for rubber as an
export. Increased palm oil supply would reduce the estimated shortage of a
basic consumption item by 35 percent; an increase in rubber production by
30 percent would enhance export earnings. Expansion of modern processing
capacity and in high-yielding Tenera plantings would gradually increase
efficiency in production. The main risks are: (i) the instability of
policy signals leading to a reversal in the currently favorable trade and
incentive framework; (ii) a tightening of credit and higher domestic
interest rates; and (iii) sustainability of good management for Adapalm and
Akwapalm beyond the project years. Since the project operates at the micro
level, it is unable to reduce the macro risks. However, t remains
economically viable even with a three-year delay in benefits or a 50
percent increase in costs. Palm oil and rubber processing would remain
financially attractive even with higher interest rates though demand for
loans may fall somewhat. The fact that Adapalm has employed private
management for more than ten years and that Akwapalm has recently done the
same on its own accord provides reassurance in respect of the third risk.
9.        Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
