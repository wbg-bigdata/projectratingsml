MMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE                             OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR I&CONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DDIECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
TH REPUBIC OF EL SALVADOR FOR AN
AGRICJLTURAL SETR REFORtM AND INVESTMET PROJECT
1.    The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of El
Salvador for the equivalent of US$40.0 million to help finance an agricultu  sector reform and
investment prqect is submitd for your approval. The loan would be at the Bank's standard variable
rate, with a maturity of twenty years, and a five years grace period. The Govenment of El Salvador
(GOES) would be the Borrower, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAG) and the
National Center for Agricultural Technology (CENTA) would be the implementing agencies.
2.    Iaclkground. El Salvador Is one of the most densely populated counties in the Western
Hemisphere, with lim!+ed natural resources and essenially no remaining agricultural land. Land
ownership is highly concentrated. Social and political tensions, erupted in 1979 in an open civil war.
At the same dme, the etnat economic environment deteriorated sharply with higher oil pnces and
inweest rates, .ower world coffee prices, and the conation of El Salvador's export markets. The
GOES' attempts to revive economic growth failed, and real Gross Domestic Product (GDP, felt by
about 13% in 19808.
3.    The present government assumed office in June 1989. It introduced a comprehensive
Economic and Social Development Plan (ESDP) for 1989-1994, designed to create a more market-
oriened economy, while seeking to eliminate absolute poverty. The government also negodated an
end to the civil conflict, culminting in the signing of Peace Accords on Janay 16, 1992. The
ESDP received strong support from the intemationa financ   ommuty: the World Bank approved
a Structr Adjustment Loan (SAL); and the International Monetary Fund, two Stand-by agreements.
Major achievements under SAL include trade liberalization, tax, and financal sector reorm, and
targeted social programs. In the agricultural sector, all domestic price controls on basic grains and
the monopoly powers of the marketing parstals were elimnated, and steps taken toward divestiture
of their assets. After a decade of stagnaion, 1990 marked a major tunig point as real GDP grew
by 3.4%, the highest rate since 1978. Inflation dropped from 24% in 1990 to 14.4% in 1991 and an
esdmated 11.2% in 1992. The main source of growth has been agriculture, especialy coffee
production, which responded to the improved trade and exchange rate policies, as well as favorable
weather conditions. Following the signing of the Peace Accords, the Govnment began
implementon of a National Reconstruction Program (NRP) to create the conditions neesary for
economic recovery and socia reconciliation in the most afected municipaities. The NRP is designed
to complement the ESDP. The proposed project has been designed to provide for ttie agricultural
extension service needs of a part of the NRP areas. A complementary agrictural development
project, to be financed by the Intnaonal Fund for Agricultural Development, would include
extension services in the mid-west portion of the NRP area.
4.    Agricultural production grew rapidly during the 1960s and 1970s, but declined by about 13%
in 1980-1989. This decline was due to the long-run deterioradon of the domestic terms of trade,
exacerbated by civil stife, land refbrm, and declinin it ational prices of the countys main
exports (coffee and cotton). In 1992, the agricultural sector contributed an estimated 9.6% of GDP,
39% of expo  and 50% of total employment (most of it in smaller farms). The dualistic stucture of
the setr is a constai t agricultural growth: 87% of farmers crop areas of less tham 3 ha (25% of
farmed area) while 3% farm areas of more than 30 ha (44% of farmed area). Most small and
medium farmers grow basic grains and beans with little diversification and low productivity. Large



-2-
farms produce a wider range of commodities, such as cotton, sesme, sugar, coffee, beef and dairy,
and achieve higher productivity. ThDs dual structure aeates two different groups of cliuts for
agricltur services. Other significant constraints are the high population density (700 ihbabitants per
squar mile). a depleted natural resource base, incomplete land reform, a weak nural credit system,
poorly managed agricultural sector insdtutions; and weak agricultural zechnology development and
dissemination.
5.    Rationale for Bank Involveamet. -Me proposed project conforms to the broad country
strategy of focusing government expenditure on providi.g public goods efficiendy and where justified,
and enhancing private sector growth within a tightly managed fiscal policy. This strategy is spelled
out in tho government's letter of Agriculwal Sector Development Strategy of September 24, 1992.
Through the project, the Bank would support priority actions oudined in the Straty ided to
promote growth and sustainabiity, i.e., strengthening institutions and providing services to farmers.
Bank involvement also aims to ensure that reform: are efflcient and transparent. The Bank is well
placed to perfrm this pivot function given its lead role in donor coordiaion and policy dialogue
within the context of the SAL and the proposed SAL It (expected to address rral financial sector and
environmentl policies and institutonal constraints), and by performing crucial economic (kay issues
in public resource allocation) and sector (basic grains marketing and natural resource management
ahalysis).
6.    Project Objectives The project would provide a vehicle for implementation of the
government's Agricultural Sector Development Stre  by assisti  GOES to: (a) Implement its
sector development plans and the agriculture-lated part of the NRP; (b) stengthen its agricultural
public sector through MAG's and CENTA's insttutional development, staff and procedural
rationalization, and support services privaization; (c) accelerate the generation of more productive
and environmetally sustable agricultura technology through research; and (d) contribute to
productivity improvements of small and medium size farmers through agriculbur eesion.
7.    Project Description. The proposed project has two components. First, the component for
reform and instituonal developnt at MAG and CENTA (US$16.7 million in tota costs) would
finance tecical assistance., equipment, training, civil works and icremental operating cost to
support: (a) managing and impeeti  MG's insfttuional planning and strategy (JS$3.4
million) for reform and development, including changing the legal framework as required by the
establishment of CENTA as an autonomous agency; (b) radenalxing MAG and CENTA's human
resources (US$7.2 million) by upgrading personnel policies, and pivazing support services and the
marketing facilities of the Supply Regulation Institute (IRA); (c) establishing management
Information ssten  (MIS) and procedures (US$1.8 million) to improve decision making and
progress montoring, including for CENTA's activities; (d) constcting a headquartes building
for MAG (US$4.3 million). Second, the component for agricultural research and extedon for
small and medium farmers (US$39.8 million) would fnance technical assistane, vehicles, equipment,
training, civil works rehabilitabon, and incremental recrrent expenditures to support: (a) research
(US$11.9 million), which would include  egrating plant and animal research; reorganizing research
along commodity lires; strengtening research plannig and priority-setng mecms; executing
on-farm adaptive trials in conjunction with the extension service; and training for research and
extension staff in soil conservation: (b) agricultural exteson (US$17.1 milion) which would
include a switch from individua extension methods to the Training and Visit system, traiing for
exnsion agents, and outeh measures to better coordinate with non-government organizations
(NGOs) and to reach women farmers: and (c) support services for research and xtenson (UJS$10.8
million) whti- would include improvement of common managerial, technical and administrative
support DeAign carried out during project preparation was facilitated by a US$1.5 milion Project



-3-
Preparation Facility (PPF) advance, a Japanese Grant (US$0.S million), and USAID grans (US$13.1
million).
8.    Project Cost and lhanclng. Total project cost is estimated at US$56.5 million (Schedule
A). The proposed loan would provide US$40.0 million, and the GOES the balnce of US$16.5
million. Of the total project cost, US$42.8 million involve investment and US$13.7 million
Inemenl recunt costs. The proposed loan would fund: (i) about 43 % of inremtal recurrent
costs on a declining basis, mosdy (75%) for extension. Such support is justified given the need to
start field activities and the current ic'. level of operatng expenditures; and (ii) up to 37% of local
costs, a level warnted by the country's transition to peace and its hvy financing commitments
under the peace aeemens, while implementing a program of fiscal austerity. The GOES wvould
finance all indemnity payments for voluntary staff reductions (US$6.6 million). To allow for the
contous delivery of extension services during the 1992/93 crop season, retroactve financing of up
to US$4.0 million is recommended for expenditures for technical assistance and operating costs
incurred after March 31, 1992. Schedule B shows the amounts and methods of procement and
disbursement, as well as the disbursoment schedule. The timetable of project processing and the
status of Bank Group operations are given In Schedules C and D, respectively. A map relevant to the
project and the Staff Appraisal Report No. 10933-ES dated March 1, 1993 are also atached.
9.    Project Impleentation. MAG and CENTA would implement the proposed project over six
years. MAG would implement the reform and institutional development component based on an
institutional development plan including MAG's Staff Rationalization Plan and a system of opeting
rules approved by the Bank, through the Advisory Technical Committee (CTA). CENTA would
implement the research and exension component based on the CENTA Law that establishes its
atonomy, as approved by the Legiatr on Febnuary 11, 1993, through its research and extesion
direrat. MAG's Agriculture Sector Planning Office (OSPA) and the Project's Administration
Unit (PAU) will monitor implemention of the project. PAU has been executing the PPF. OSPA
would monitor project progress in implementng the government sector development straegy, and hire
consultants to prepare independent evaluations of project actvities. PAU would monitor Bank-
specific requirment of the loan (e.g. preparation of infrmation for the annual and mid-term
reviews, covenants compliance, disbursements, procurement, audits) on a day-to-day basis.
10. Project Sustalnabilty. Project sustainability depends on management and organizational
development and the budgetary rationalization for MAO and CENTA. DIPEI would monitor,
evaluate and make adjustments in staffing and MIS policy as necessary to sustain the reform process.
Special consideraton has been given to keeping the project's expected real recurrent expenditures
within MAO's current budget ceilings. Salary savings are expected to provide the required resources
to finance incremental operat  costs as MAG implements its reform agenda.
11.   Lesons from Previous Projects. Tbe Bank has had no agriculture-elated operations in El
Salvador since the Indusial and Agricultural Training Project (Loan IS71-ES approved in 1978 for
US$9.0 million). The 1985 Project Completion Report for that project recommends better
coordination of training activities for small farmers and increased priority for agricltdral technology
training instead of social services-oriented traming. Relevant lessons from recent ewxperiences in other
countries, include: (a) in ciil serice reform, eperience demon   that govement ownership,
commiment and inte ization of the reform are essential to success. An eady lesson about
privatzatlon is that success depends on supportive policies, including removal of price distordons
and barriers to entry into the privatized industry. Although the newly achieved peace and the GOES'
econonic reforms are ewpected to reiforce the dynamism of the private sector, massive armed forces
demobiization and immnnent elections may impose addiWonad constraints on GOES' ability and



-4-
resolve to streamline its labor force. The reform and Institutonal dvelopment component takes
stock of these ewperiences, pardcularly by requiring key reforms before effectiveness; and (b)
aCUlural research and extension. Constraints to successfil research and extension have been
poor admisaive management and insufficient operatg budget and technical training, weak
researc/extension linkages and a rigd top-down approach to extension. The research and extension
component of the proposed project focusses directly on all these issues including the adoption of the
T&V method, which has been successfil as a means of improving staff and fumer training,
extensions linkages to research, and farmer participation.
12.   Act0ons Agreed. During negotiations, the government agreed to the following: (a) to
allocate, at least, agreed minimum annual budgets for recurrent costs for MAO and CENTA for the
project and to discuss and agree with the Bank the project's work programs and budget allocations
during the project's annual reviews; (b) carry out the agreed action plans to make seed certification
independent of CENTA by 1993 and to eliminate commercial seed production from CENTA by 1994;
(c) adopt procedures for the selection of CENTA personnel eligible for tning and for human
resources management; (d) to submit to the Legislature the MAG organic law before December 31,
1993 and to issue implemeion regulations: (i) within three months of the organic law's approval;
and (ii) for the CENTA law within three months of effectiveness; (e) to present an action plan,
satisfactory to the Bank, within 60 days of notice by the Bank, of corrective measures if the annu4
and mid-term reviews identify areas where project objectives have not been fuly met; (t) to use
areed implementation and impact indicators as a basis of the amnual and mid-term reviews; and (g) to
hold an annual project review no later than September 30 of each year except 1994 and a mid-tem
review no ater than November 30, 1994. As conditions of loan effectiveness the government would
present, satisfactory to the Bank: (a) evidence of initiation of implementaton of the agreed MAO Staff
Rationalization Plan; and (b) a signed MAG-CENTA impleientation   rent reflecting their
respective responsibilities in the implementaion of the projecz, aod attaching ratification by CENTA's
Board of Directm of. (Q) CENTA's 1993 non-academic traiinng program; and ii) the creria and
procedures for selectig and managing CENTA staff for academic training and for placing those staff
in CENTA upon their return. As conditions of disbursements, the Govnment would present a copy
of: (a) a Mnisteri Decree and CENTA Board of Directors decision adopting rules for ntnal MAO
and CENTA transportation services, satisfctory to the Banlk prior to any disbuement for vehicles;
and (b) CENTA Board of Directors' decision to implement the actions in the MAO Staff
Rationlization Plan that concern the autonoirs CENTA, prior to any disbment for CENTA's
activities under the project.
13.   Beneits. ITe project's expected main benefits are: Q) improved resource allocation; and (ii)
more effective provision of services in the agricultural sector. Resource allocation would improve as
a result of the elimnination of governnent's role in agricultura marketing, direct production and non-
agricultural acivities, and of better sectoral priority settng and instittional efficiency. The
government's ability to reorient public sector resources to regulatory and support services would also
allow resource realocation to priority functions. The proposed project is expected to provide
permaent capacity to MAG and CENTA to plan, design, carry out, evaluate and readjust institutional
strategies and organizational planning consist with policies and programs for the sector. More
effective provision of agricultural research and extension services is expected to result in increased
and more sustanable production through improved crop and livestock productivity, lowering input
use, upgrading cropping practices and ensuring more sustainable resouce use. Although the project's
impact on poverty cannot be easily quanified beause of the difficulties in asdging short-term
income effects to agricultural research and extension, experince from other opea   indicates that
technological change in agriculture is a major source of productvity gains and income grwth among
poor producers.



-5-^
14.   The proposed project has an environment ratng of WB. Et would produce institutional
benefits by fortiying CENTA's abflity to analyze aul resource and environmental Issue.
Environmental beneits are expected for (a' eops: reearch supported by the project would improve
mmaD_tno of soils, agrochemcls, and pests. Soils rearch and extension would extend known
consevaion methods and develop methods where economic solutions do not exist Research and
etension on reducing agrochemical use would build from the bae established by previous tecnical
assistance project In CENTA; (b) livestock: animal reseach would produce   me nl beneft
through greater efficiency of feed production and use. Becau  much of the expansion of tropical
nimal production has boee thtough more depredatory land use, sounder feed production and use
would be expected to lessen pressure on tropical lands; and (c) forestry: forest research would focus
on natura resource conservation issues, and lessons of on-going agoforesy projects would be
incorporated into extension agents' technology messages.
15.   Risks. A major risk is GOES' abiity to carry out its reform agenda, pariculaly in the am
of staff streamlining. The Covernment has presented a letter from the Minister of Finance to the
Minister of Agriculture supporting MAG's Staff Rationalization Plan and agreeing to make available
the funds for its implementation. MAG's 1993 budget approved by the Legislature has been
increased in anticipation of these needs. These risks are reduced by the timing of the remainder of
the major institudonal reform actions before effectiveness. Generd risks associated with research and
etension projects, in Bank experience, are adequacy and susainability of funding, inability to set
priotes, poor management, and weak researnenion1s. 1the prcieci wobb abbre.a f d
those ri  in the resarch and development component. Project deiga also a,flects speci  project
risk including management weakness and lack of familiarity with Bank procedures. Any possible
issues related to the implementation of the peace agreements and agrarian reform would not be
expected to affect this operation significantly because the etsion component will provide farmers
training through CENIA and NMOs regardless of land ownership status.
16.   Re     daton. I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles of
Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
