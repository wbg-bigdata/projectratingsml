INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA FOR A
FOREST RESOURCES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.      I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in an
amount of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) 8.5 million (US$9 million equivalent)
on standard IDA terms to help finance a Forest Resources Development Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.      The most recent economic report, "Economic Adjustment in Sri Lanka:
Issues and Prospects" (Report No. 3901-CE, May 27, 1982), was distributed to
the Executive Directors on June 3, 1982. Country data are provided in
Annex I.
3.      After several years of relative stagnation, Sri Lanka's economy has
experienced sustained growth. This growth has been the direct result of the
economic liberalization of 1977, and the development push associated with it.
Until 1977, Sri Lanka's growth performance had been below both need and
potential. Although GDP growth in the 1960s, at 4.4% per annum, was above
the average for low income countries, it slackened sharply in the 1970-77
period to 2.9% per annum, just below the average for low income countries.
Through much of this period, the terms of trade deteriorated steadily, erod-
ing even these modest gains; as a consequence, per capita gross national
income rose by a mere 0.9% per annum during these years. The slowdown in
economic growth in the 1970-77 period was attributable to a combination of
factors, including inadequate investment, poor management of the economy, and
a policy environment not conducive to growth and investment; these factors
were compounded by poor weather in some years and a sharp rise in the cost of
imported food and petroleum.
4.      The three tree crops--tea, rubber and coconuts--which are still the
mainstay of the economy, suffered from low replanting and inadequate incen-
tives.   These problems were exacerbated by a dual exchange rate system,
introduced in 1968, that discriminated against these crops, and by the uncer-
tainties surrounding a protracted nationalization (1972-75) of the larger
estates. After the exceptional output growth of the 1960s, rice yields and
cropping intensities declined in the 1970-77 period due to poor institutional
support. Investment in manufacturing was also low, and the inefficiency of
most public and private sector firms, nurtured in a highly protected environ-
ment, resulted in growth of manufacturing of 1% per annum. The only bright
spots were subsidiary food crops and industrial exports which benefited from
good incentives.



-2-
5.      An inadequate public savings effort, caused by inelastic revenues
and uncontrolled growth in recurrent expenditures, inhibited public invest-
ment. Unfavorable policies further constrained private savings. The slow
growth rates and changes in the structure of output provided neither the jobs
nor the employment structure for a growing labor force. The low output
growth, the excessive capital intensity of investment, the mismatch between
the job aspirations of those with post-primary education and the jobs avail-
able to them, the post-war demographic bulge, and the rising female par-
ticipation rates contributed to a massive increase in unemployment, estimated
at over 1 million, or some 18% of the labor force in 1977.
6.      In sharp contrast to this poor economic performance, Sri Lanka's
social achievements in relation to per capita income have been outstanding.
Sri Lanka has about one and one-half times the life expectancy, almost thrice
the literacy, one-cuarter the infant mortality, and half the birth rate which
would be expected for a country at its per capita income level. Nutrition
levels have been adequate, and in the 1960s paralleled gains in income dis-
tribution. These improvements in the quality of life, in particular the rise
in health standards, the spread of education and the availability of sub-
sidized food have been important factors in the decline in mortality. The
increasing age of marriage, the spread of female education and employment,
and a vigorous family planning program, have also contributed to a sharp
decline in fertility. As a consequence, population growth, net of migration,
has dropped steadily, from 2.7% per annum in the 1953-63 period to 2.2% per
annum in the 1963-71 period, and 1.7% per annum during 1971-81.
7.      Favorable initial conditions induced these social gains.  Compulsory
primary education was introduced as early as 1901. The food ration was
introduced in 1942. Thus, at the time of Independence in 1948, Sri Lanka
already enjoyed high levels of adult literacy and life expectancy. These
initial gains were consolidated and expanded in the post-independence
period through large expenditures on social services and the food subsidy,
expenditures which accounted for two-fifths to one-half of government
revenues in the 1960s and early 1970s. These expenditures were traditionally
financed by capturing the surpluses of the three major tree crops, which
provided the Government with easy sources of revenue and foreign exchange.
These surpluses began to decline in the late 1960s as government policies
discriminated against tree crops and export unit prices weakened. As growth
in other productive sectors also decelerated in the 1970-77 period, the
budgetary resources available for social programs were squeezed between
inelastic revenues and rapid inflation. As a consequence, expenditures for
social services other than the food subsidy began to decline as a proportion
of total current expenditures and of GDP, threatening the hard-won gains in
health and education. In short, the economy could no longer generate the
resources needed tc, sustain the large program of welfare expenditures.
Moreover, the very size of those programs reduced the scope for policy makers
to shift resources to development.
8.      The policy changes introduced in 1977, following the election of the
United National Party, were intended to break this vicious circle. T'he new



-3-
Government identified its objectives as the sustained revival and resuscita-
tion of the economy and increased employment through (i) increased capacity
utilization in the productive sectors, (ii) stimulation of savings and
investment, and (iii) efforts to encourage exports, and import substitution
in foodgrains. A program of policy reforms was developed in close consult-
ation with the IMF. These reforms were supported initially by an IMF standby
arrangement covering 1978 for SDR 93 million. On January 26, 1979, the
Fund's Executive Board approved an SDR 260 million Extended Arrangement to
cover the 1979-81 period. The principal aim of the reform program was to
dismantle controls over resource allocation and initiate price adjustments
with a view to establishing more realistic relative prices. By 1980, these
goals had largely been achieved.
9.      The program of reforms comprised a number of major policy initia-
tives. The exchange rate was unified 1/ on November 16, 1977, at a
depreciated rate of Rs 16 = US$1.00 and allowed to float. This implied a
depreciation of 46% against the official rate prevailing prior to unifica-
tion, and 11.2% with respect to the Foreign Exchange Entitlement Certificate
(FEEC) rate. The trade and payments regime was liberalized. Public sector
import monopolies were almost entirely terminated. Prior licensing of
imports was abolished for all but a handful of commodities. The tariff
structure was revised and simplified. Other budgetary taxes and subsidies
were adjusted to reflect the change in trade and exchange rate policies. In
particular, rice and sugar rations were confined to the poorer half of the
population, and the food subsidy was eliminated through a series of adjust-
ments in administered prices. On September 1, 1979, the Government intro-
duced a system of food and kerosene stamps for families with monthly incomes
of less than Rs 300 to replace specific subsidies and food rationing, and
to target benefits to the poor. To help offset the adverse impact of these
changes on real incomes, public sector wages were periodically adjusted
upwards. Public corporations were asked to pass on cost increases, except
for fertilizer, petroleum, milk, and public transport, for which price
increases were initially deferred to cushion the impact on consumers. The
Government subsequently eliminated the overall subsidy on petroleum products
and made sizable adjustments in bus and train fares, electricity and fer-
tilizer prices. The burden of selected subsidies and transfers, as a conse-
quence, fell from around 10% of GDP in 1977 to around 3% by 1981. These
changes, and higher aid receipts, have helped permit a sizable increase in
capital expenditures.
10.     Agricultural pricing policies have changed dramatically.  The domes-
tic support price for paddy was increased by 21% in November 1977, by 25% in
November 1980, and by a further 15% in the course of 1981 following substan-
tial increases in fertilizer prices. With the related increase in flour
prices, incentives for paddy and other flour substitutes benefited. At the
1/ Prior to unification, all exports other than tea, rubber, and coconut
products and all imports other than food, fertilizers, and drugs were
channelled through the certificate market. Since November 1972, the FEEC
rate was maintained at a 65% premium over the official rate.



-4-
same time, there occurred a large policy-induced decline in the role cf the
state in domestic rice trade. Fresh coconut prices were also increased, and
in November 1981, the system of fixed and variable duties which had effec-
tively insulated the large domestic coconut market from the world market was
replaced by a sliding scale export system that allowed some linkage between
the two markets. While the unification of the exchange rate ended formal
discrimination against tree crops, high export duties, particularly on tea,
continued to siphon off most of the operating surplus for the Government.
As tea prices fell and production costs rose in 1978-79, the Government
responded to the reduced producer margins by lowering taxes on tea exports.
The Government also ended most price controls, and reformed the interest rate
and tax systems. The burden of company and personal taxation was lowered,
and the taxation system was rationalized to increase revenue elasticity;
nevertheless, the overall revenue elasticity to economic growth and domestic
inflation remains low as taxes on slowly growing tree crop exports still
average about 30% of current revenues. Interest rates were also raised
sharply to encourage savings and discourage speculative imports. However,
inflation eroded these rates and in April 1980 further upward adjustments
were made.
11.     These economic reforms were accompanied by a major effort to step
up public investment. The Government-s capital expenditures jumped from 6%
of GDP in 1977 to an average of 13% in 1978 and 1979, and 19% in 1980, as
government departments responded to the initial improvement in the budgetary
resource position and embarked on long overdue replacement investments and
new projects that had been shelved earlier for lack of resources. At the
same time, the Government undertook three major new programs which are to be
the lead projects in a five-year rolling public investment program. Ihese
are: (i) accelerated implementation of the Mahaweli Ganga Development
Program, by far the largest multipurpose river basin development program ever
undertaken in Sri Lanka; (ii) a 200 square mile free trade zone north of
Colombo under a newly constituted Greater Colombo Economic Commission which
has established the first of several Investment Promotion Zones near
Colombo-s international airport and by end-1981 had signed agreements with 68
investors involving a total investment of US$100 million; and (iii) a massive
housing and urban renewal program with its main focus on the Colombo
metropolitan region, including the construction of a new capital complex at
Kotte, a suburb of Colombo. Budgetary expenditures on these three programs
will amount to Rs 34 billion, or 34% of projected budgetary resources over
the 1982-86 period. The underlying public investment strategy seeks to
balance the large investment requirements of the Government-s high priority
programs with the urgent rehabilitation and fresh investment needs in other
sectors. The main thrust of the public sector program is to lay the founda-
tion for longer-term development by expanding social and economic infrastruc-
ture, while also providing for some short-term growth. Private fixed invest-
ment has responded well in some areas to the economic reforms, increasing
from about 7% of GDP in 1977 to 12% by 1980 and contributing to an overall
fixed investment of 31% of GDP in 1980.
12.     In response to the policy reforms and the accompanying acceleration
in investment, economic growth in 1978-81 averaged an impressive 6.5% per



-5-
annum. This growth was shared by almost all sectors of the economy, par-
ticularly construction and services. The only major exception has been the
tree crop sector. The otherwise impressive performance is due to a number of
factors including the improved availability of inputs following import
liberalization, an increased role for the private sector in distribution, and
the removal of price controls. Although there is little information avail-
able on employment, Central Bank estimates suggest that unemployment dropped
from 18% of the labor force to 15% between 1977 and 1979.
13.     Despite this strong performance, major weaknesses in economic perfor-
mance had emerged by 1980. In particular, the national savings effort had
not matched the rapid rise in investment. Gross national savings fluctuated
around 15% of GDP during the 1978-80 period, while recourse to foreign
savings to finance the higher investment rose from 4.5% of GDP in 1978 to
20.0% in 1980. Although the Government has succeeded in containing the
costly consumer subsidy and transfer programs, expenditures on which have
declined as a percent of GDP (para 9), relatively inelastic revenues combined
with steadily rising other recurrent expenditures and declining terms of
trade resulted in hardly any public savings over the 1978-80 period. As a
result, the Government has financed its rapidly rising capital expenditures
through foreign aid, and increased domestic borrowings. Initially the
Government met its domestic financing requirements through non-expansionary
borrowings from captive financial institutions, which could mobilize
increased private savings following the interest rate reform. However,
resources raised through these channels have not grown as rapidly as the
budgetary deficit, and the Government was increasingly forced to undertake
expansionary borrowings from the Central Bank. Between 1978 and 1979, these
rose from 0.4% to 1.2% of GDP and in 1980 increased sharply to 10.5% of GDP.
It has also resorted to the use of foreign commercial loans to help finance
the deficit, borrowing US$50 million in 1980, and US$75 million in 1981.
14.     Inflation has also increased sharply since 1977.  The exchange rate
adjustment, the other policy-induced price increases and related wage
increases, the removal of price controls, and the build-up of external
assets, which added to the money supply, contributed significantly to infla-
tionary pressures in 1978 and 1979. However, these were moderated by bumper
paddy harvests, increased capacity utilization in the economy, increased
availability of imports, and the beneficial effects of competition from
imports and in domestic distribution. Since then, rapid growth in the broad
money supply--38% in 1979 and 32% in 1980--added a sizable "built-in"
increase to the system. Together with the corrective price increases
designed to reduce budgetary subsidies and keep pace with rapid increases in
international petroleum, wheat and sugar prices, these pressures caused
inflation (as measured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index) to accelerate
from an average of 11% in 1978 and 1979, to 26% in 1980.
15.     Rapid expansion in economic activity has been reflected most vividly
in the balance of payments. Import volume growth since 1978 has averaged
15%. Between 1978 and 1980, the net petroleum import bill more than tripled
and increased from 11% to 36% of non-petroleum exports, while capital goods
imports more than doubled in response to the acceleration in investment.
However, exports have shown barely any volume growth as declining tree crop



-6-
export volumes offset the strong growth in garments exports. These adverse
trade volume trends were compounded by an 18% terms of trade deterioration
over the same period. The rapid growth in tourism receipts and private
remittances from abroad in this period failed to offset the deterioration on
the trade account and the current account deficit rose from US$124 million
(4.5% of GDP) in 1978 to US$805 million in 1980 (20.0% of GDP). In 1978 and
1979, rapidly rising non-monetary capital inflows due mainly to increased net
aid disbursements more than offset the current account deficit, and Sri Lanka
continued to add to its net international reserves, albeit at a declining
rate. In 1980, however, net international reserves fell by US$220 million,
and by end-1980 gross international reserves stood at US$377 million, or
equivalent to less than nine weeks of imports of goods and non-factor serv-
ices. With the rapid drawdown in reserves, the public sector has begun to
make significant use of commercial financing.
16.     The Government, realizing in early 1981 that continuation of the 1980
trends would risk continued high inflation and unsustainable pressures on the
balance of payments, took corrective steps. Budgetary expenditures were held
below their 1980 level in nominal terms, implying significant cuts. Capital
expenditures declined significantly from 19% of GDP in 1980, to about 14% of
GDP, and were held to below their 1980 level in nominal terms. As a result,
the overall deficit declined from 23% to 16% of GDP; bank borrowings, from
10.7 to 4.5% of GDP. Similar improvement was achieved in the balance of
payments, where the current account deficit declined from 20% to 15% of GDP,
and net international reserves declined by only an additional US$33 million
over 1980. Due mainly to large disbursements under the IMF Extended Arrange-
ment and Compensatory Finance Facility, Sri Lanka's gross international
reserves increased to US$451 million, equivalent to about 11 weeks' imports
coverage. The stabilization measures also resulted In a significant decline
in inflation--the Colombo Consumer Price Index averaged 18% growth during
1981, compared to 26% in 1980.
17.     Current indications are that the significant achievements towards
stabilization in 1981 are not being sustained in 1982. As a percent of GDP,
the budget deficit is expected to increase in 1982 over 1981 and the Govern-
ment is, among others, having to rely on substantial external commercial
borrowing for budget support. It will be important to reverse these develop-
ments. Continued strong measures will be needed throughout the medium term
to ensure that budgetary expenditures are consistent with overall economic
stability, as many of the large development schemes the Government has
initiated are only now beginning to peak. Sri Lanka will also have to care-
fully monitor balance of payments developments, commercial borrowings in
particular, and accelerate exports growth to ensure longer-run stability in
the external sector.
18.     Aid donors have responded enthusiastically to the Government's
development initiatives. Between 1977 and 1981, aid commitments more than
tripled, to a record US$815 million. Most of the growth has come in project
aid, reflecting the Government's efforts to increase investment, particularly
in the Accelerated Mahaweli Program. Since public investment is now over-
programmed, continued high levels of aid will depend upon donors' abilities
to shift from project to non-project aid, to finance a sizable portion of



-7-
local costs, and provide supplementary financing for ongoing projects where
needed. The Government will need to maintain donor confidence in its
economic policies and management through a vigorous domestic resource mobi-
lization program and continued restraint on government expenditures. Sri
Lanka's budgetary situation remains tight. The adverse impact on revenues of
slowly rising export prices and volumes, and rapidly rising import prices,
has increased budgetary pressures. Local cost financing, in support of Sri
Lanka-s own resource mobilization efforts will not only provide valuable
relief to these budgetary pressures but also supplement foreign exchange
resources needed in support of the balance of payments.
19.     External public debt outstanding and disbursed stood at US$1,585
million at the end of 1981, amounting to about 36% of GDP. However, this
is mostly long-term concessional debt. As a result, the debt service burden
is relatively low; the debt service ratio in 1981 excluding IMF repurchases
stood at 8.7% of exports of goods and non-factor services, declining from
16.7% in 1976, primarily as a result of a decline in outstanding short- and
medium-term commercial borrowings. Recent resort to commercial finance,
however, means that the debt service ratio will begin to rise again. Unless
early steps are taken to further reduce the ratio of the current account
deficit to GDP, Sri Lanka's reliance on shorter maturity commercial borrow-
ings to fill the gap between the current account deficit and likely conces-
sional aid flows may grow significantly. In that case, the debt service
ratio would increase quickly and substantially.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SRI LANKA
20.     Since the beginning of its operations in Sri Lanka in 1954, the Bank
Group has approved nine loans totalling US$115.6 million (net of cancella-
tions) and 32 credits totalling US$608.0 million 1/ (net of cancellations) in
support of 38 projects.  About 48% of Bank Group assistance has been for
agriculture (irrigation, agricultural, and dairy development), 18% for power,
11% for transport, and the remainder for development finance company opera-
tions, a program credit (mainly involving the import of raw materials for
industry), water supply, construction industry, and telecommunications and
small and medium industries. Eight loans and eleven credits have been fully
disbursed so far. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank Group
operations as of September 30, 1982 together with notes on the execution of
ongoing projects.
21.     IFC has an equity investment of about US$150,000 equivalent in the
Development Finance Corporation of Ceylon (DFCC). Two IFC lines of credit
totalling US$7.0 million have been made to the Government-owned Bank of
Ceylon (BOC) for term loans to medium industries. IFC has also an investment
of US$250,000 in an equipment leasing company. In FY81, IFC approved an
1/ As of September 30, 1982.



investment of about US$0.7 million in equity and about US$19.3 million in
loans for a new hotel project in Colombo.
22.     The Bank Group-s current strategy focusses on the agricultural sec-
tor.  It aims to support Government efforts to increase food production and
reduce dependence on food imports, and to raise productivity, employment,
incomes and living standards of the rural population in Sri Lanka. This
strategy includes projects to support basic infrastructure.  In addition to
providing financing for the Second and Third Mahaweli Ganga Development
Projects and the Mahaweli Ganga Technical Assistance Project, the Bank Group
is assisting GOSL in implementing the Accelerated Mahaweli Ganga Development
Program (Accelerated Mahaweli Program) principally through coordinating
external assistance. The Board approved a Tea Rehabilitation and Diver-
sification Project on May 4,1982 and a loan of US$42.7 million to Ceylon
Electricity Board for a diesel power project on June 7, 1982. Current:Ly
under appraisal are an industrial development project and a rural development
project.
23.     The Bank Group, as of end-1981, accounted for 9.7% (IBRD, 1.8%:; IDA,
7.9%) of Sri Lanka's total debt outstanding and disbursed, and 6.3% (over 80%
IBRD) of debt service on medium and long-term debt.  The projected Bank
Groups share in total existing external debt outstanding and disbursed will
increase to 17% by 1985 (with IBRD's share declining to 1.3%). The Bank and
IDA portions of this debt service are expected to decline to about 4% by
1985.
PART III - THE FORESTRY SECTOR
24.      In 1979, the Bank carried out a forestry sector review at the request
of the Government. The report identified as the main constraints to the
development of the forestry sector lack of basic reliable data and plaining
capacity, and a severe shortage of trained manpower. The latest forest
inventory dates back to 1960, and is based on an aerial photography carried
out in 1956. At that time, a total of 2.9 million ha (44%) out of the
country-s total land area of 6.6 million ha was under forests. Since then,
the forest area has been substantially reduced and is now estimated at about
1.6 million ha or 24% of the total land area. Urgent measures are required
to arrest this trend.
25.     Although value added to GDP from forestry is estimated at only 1.5%,
this figure does not fully represent the importance of the sector to the
economy. Firewood provides about 60% of the energy need of the country.
About 70% of the firewood is consumed by the rural people who rely on tradi-
tional fuels for cooking and heating. The bulk of the remaining 30% is used
by low income urban families and tea factories. The forests also play an
important environmental role in the protection of land and soil.



-9-
Forestry Institutions
26.     The Government owns and manages all forests in Sri Lanka.  The
Hinistry of Lands and Land Development is the main institution in charge of
the development of the sector. The principal sector institutions reporting
to this Ministry are the Forest Department (FD) and the State Timber Corpora-
tion (STC).
27.     The main responsibility of the Forest Department is the management
and protection of forest reserves, including plantations and reforestation
and development of forest resources. However, FD was unable to carry out
this responsibility effectively in the past because it failed to establish
the necessary data base. FD's main emphasis has been on increased planting,
but the post-planting silvicultural treatment, on which the final yields and
economic return depend, has been neglected. The principal constraint has
been shortage of trained staff in FD in relation to the level of activities.
While plantation establishment has increased by 128% from 3,200 ha in 1961 to
7,300 ha in 1981, the professional and technical staff of FD has been
increased by only 29% and 22% respectively.
28.     The State Timber Corporation is responsible for felling, extracting,
converting and marketing wood. Felling and extracting is mainly done by
private contractors for STC. The other organizations operating in the
forestry sector include the Ceylon Plywood Corporation and the National Paper
Corporation. In addition, agricultural plantations (i.e. tree crops such as
rubber and coconut) under various ministries contribute to the total wood
supply (almost 20%), particularly to the supply of industrial wood (about
40%).
Forest Operations
29.     The national forests in Sri Lanka have traditionally been looked upon
as an abundant resource which supplied most of the country's wood require-
ments. Until recently, they were exploited through a selection felling
system. However, with the rapid deforestation now taking place in Sri Lanka,
consensus for environmental protection grew increasingly stronger. Lacking a
sufficient data base for a selective action based on technical considera-
tions, the Government, in 1977, stopped almost all exploitation of the
forests in the rich Wet Zone. At present, most of the wood is supplied
through clearfellings under the Mahaweli scheme and through salvage opera-
tions of about 12,000 ha teak plantations damaged by the 1978 cyclone. The
size of operations and the annual production target are determined by the
need for land to be released for agricultural development under the Mahaweli
scheme and the progress of the salvage operations rather than by timber
demand.
30.     The increased awareness of the rapid depletion of forest resources
had recently led to a continuous increase in plantation targets. However,
this trend was broken in 1981 when, due to budgetary constraints, only
foreign aid assisted projects were allowed to continue. It appears now that
the Government intends to maintain the plantation establishment program at a
level of 10-12 thousand ha per year.



-10-
Wood Supply and Demand
31.     Total wood consumption in Sri Lanka is currently estimated at about
7 million m3. Of this total, about 6 million m3 or about 90% is for firewood
and about 0.9 million m3 or 10% for industrial purposes. In addition to
domestic production, Sri Lanka imported about 10,000 m3 of industrial plywood
and about 3,000 m3 of industrial sawnwood annually between 1979 and 1931. At
present, however, Sri Lanka is self-sufficient both in sawnwood and plywood,
mainly as a result of reduced industrial demand and the temporary boost in
log production from the Mahaweli scheme forest clearing and the salvage
operations of cyclone-damaged teak plantations. As the latter tail off,
imports of industrial wood are likely to resume by the mid-1980s to help meet
a projected increase in demand of about 3% per annum through the 1990s. As
regards firewood, it is estimated that the existing resources would be suffi-
cient to meet consumption requirements for the next 20 years, although there
would be a logistics problem due to the fact that the forests are located in
sparesely populated areas of the country. Because the short term firewood
resource position is good and in view of the short rotation of firewood
plantations, which may be only 3 to 5 years compared to a minimum of 20 years
for industrial woods, priority must now be given to the establishment of
industrial plantations.
Forest Industry
32.     Sawmilling dominates the forest industry in Sri Lanka.  About 90% of
the mills belong to the private sector. Of the Government operated mills,
nine sawmills are managed by the State Timber Corporation and two plywood
mills by the Ceylon Plywood Corporation. The National Paper Corporation
operates two pulp and paper mills. Sri Lanka's forest industry is old and
has developed very little over the past decade, although it has been fairly
profitable. The growing shortage of industrial wood, which has only tem-
porarily been ameliorated by the Mahaweli and cyclone salvage operations,
seems to be the reason for the lack of interest in new investment.
Forestry Training
33.     There is only one forestry training institute in the country which
provides in-service training for forest guards. Its capacity is inadequate.
Forest rangers and senior professional foresters have traditionally been
trained in India. But, because of India's requirements to use its limited
facilities to train its own nationals, access to Indian institutes has become
increasingly difficult for foreigners. As a result, there is a serious
shortage of forestry staff at all levels in Sri Lanka. USAID is presently
providing assistance for the introduction of a two-year course for forest
rangers at the institute. However, the forest guard training facilities also
urgently needs rehabilitation and expansion.
Government Plans and Objectives
34.     According to the Public Investment Plan of 1982-86, the main
long-term objectives of the forestry sector are: conservation, protection



-11l-
and management of forests; reforestation of catchment areas; planting of
fast-growing firewood species; and development of forest plantations to meet
industrial and other requirements. To meet these objectives, staff training
and the preparation of a long-term plan for forestry development with opera-
tional goals are of the highest priority.
External Assistance
35.     The proposed project would be the first IDA assistance specifically
for forestry. Previous IDA assistance to the forestry sector has been as
small components of tree crop diversification and rehabilitation and rural
development projects. UNDP/FAO are currently undertaking the preparation of
a forest inventory which will be used in the preparation of the Master Plan
under the proposed project. USAID, ADB, NORAD, and SIDA are financing
firewood plantations. A Swiss Satellite Imagery Project is providing assis-
tance for the preparation of a land use map which will provide an essential
input for the proposed forest inventory exercise.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
36.     The proposed project was prepared by the Government with the assis-
tance of consultants financed by UNDP. It was appraised by an IDA mission in
April-May 1982. A timetable of key events relating to the project and spe-
cial conditions of the proposed credit are given in Annex III. Negotiations
were held in Washington from November 22 to November 24, 1982. The Sri Lanka
delegation was headed by Mr. Nanda Abeywickrema, Secretary, Ministry of Lands
and Land Development. A staff appraisal report entitled "Forest Resources
Development Project (Forestry I)", (Report No. 4089-CE, dated December 17, 1982)
is being distributed separately.
Project Objectives and Description
37.     The project aims at strengthening planning capability in the forestry
sector, reducing manpower constraints through training, improving the manage-
ment and development of plantations, and strengthening research and trial
programs to improve sector productivity. It would consist of the following
components:
Master Plan. To remedy the lack of planning in the sector, the project would
provide technical assistance for the preparation of a sector master plan.
The project would finance the costs of foreign experts and local staff,
vehicles and equipment needed for the preparation of the plan and the invest-
ment program which would be coordinated by a Planning Unit to be established
under the project within the Ministry of Lands and Land Development. The
plan would define specific development targets for a period of 20 years. In
addition, the plan would include a detailed operational investment program
for the first five years. Its preparation would involve an institutional
development study, forest inventory, preparation of forest management plans,
assessment of non-forest wood resources, establishment of a data bank, and



-12-
studies related to wood market and demand, forest industry, wood utilization,
logging and transportation, and cost accounting.
Forestry Training. The shortage of people with forestry training is probably
the most serious constraint to the development of forest resources in Sri
Lanka. The requirement of trained forestry staff by the year 2000 is
estimated at about 200 professionals, and 613 technicians (foresters and
forest rangers) compared to about 40 and 240, respectively, at present. The
proposed project would help provide professional and forest guard training;
the training of forest rangers is being provided under a USAID project (para
33). The professional training program for 12-15 students annually would be
established at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura near Colombo. In addi-
tion, some scholarships would be offered to train foresters in fields where
no specialists are presently available in Sri Lanka. The University would
prepare a training program for the scholarships by December 31, 1983 for
IDA-s review (Section 3.07, DCA). Funds have also been included for short
(4-6 weeks each) study tours abroad for professional forestry staff. GOSL
would prepare a program for such tours by December 31, 1983 for IDA-s review
(Section 3.07, DCA). The project would also strengthen training facilities
to permit increasing the training of forest guards and rangers from 15 to 30,
in total. In addition to the professional and technical training included
under the project, considerable in-service training would be provided by the
consultants in their respective fields.
Plantations. Two general areas have been identified for industrial planta-
tions under the project. One is in the Batticaloa and Amparai Districts and
the other in the Moneragala and Hambantota Districts (see attached map).
Forest protection, ground preparation trials and a socioeconomic study would
be carried out in these areas. The climatic and soil conditions are known to
be suitable for the species selected for the plantations. The project would
establish about 8,000 ha of new industrial plantations. A soil and site
survey under the project would provide the basis for site selection. About
75% of the plantings would be with Eucalyptus tereticornis and Eucalyptus
citriodora. 15% would be with Albizia odorotissima, Azadirachta indica and
Gmelina arborea on a pilot basis because of their promising performance in
the Dry Zone. The remaining 10% would be Teak. While Eucalyptus teretcornis
and citriodora grow well in the project areas, they are not optimal species
for the production of construction grade lumber. During the life of the
project, it is intended to develop technical packages which would make it
possible in the future to increase the planting of species of proven sawlog
quality such as Gmelina, Albizia, Azadiracta and conifers. About 10,000 ha
of existing teak plantations would be upgraded mainly through thinning and
about 15,000 ha of young stands of teak, pine and mahogany would be improved
through applying appropriate silvicultural treatment, identified during the
inventory, comprising combinations of clearing, singling and pruning. About
1,000 ha of overmature stands would be harvested and replanted. In addition,
species and land clearance trials, and forest protection and socio-economic
studies would be carried out to pave the way for future development.



-13-
Project Implementation
38.     The project would be implemented by three executing agencies over a
six-year period, 1983-88. The Planning Unit of the Ministry of Lands and
Land Development would be responsible for the Master Plan, the Forest Depart-
ment for plantation activities and technical training, and the University of
Sri Jayawardenepura for professional training. The Planning Unit and the
Forest Department are under the Ministry of Lands while the University is
under the Ministry of Higher Education. Overall project implementation and
coordination would be the responsibility of the Ministry of Lands, with the
Chief of the Planning Unit serving as the Project Director. The Forest
Department and the University would each appoint a coordinator for their
respective project components. There would be a Project Coordinating Commit-
tee chaired by the Project Director. An Inter-ministerial Forestry Master
Plan Steering Committee has been set up to permit the involvement of con-
cerned agencies in the preparation of the Master Plan. This committee would
be chaired by the Secretary of the Ministry of Lands (Section 3.10, DCA).
Staffin-0
39.     For project implementation, additional staff would be hired
for the Planning Unit, the Forest Department and the University of Sri
Jayawardenepura. The Planning Unit would require three professionals and
the Project Director plus an accountant, an administrative officer and sup-
port staff. A project and cost management accountant and an administrative
officer would need to be recruited by the Forest Department. Although rely-
ing mainly on existing staff and consultants, the University would need to
recruit a course director and support staff for the new course. The Ministry
of Lands and Land Development has informed IDA that essential staff positions
for the Planning Unit, the Forest Department and the University of Sri
Jayawardenepura had been included in the 1983 budget request.  Because of
their importance for project implementation, it is proposed that the follow-
ing appointments be undertaken prior to credit effectiveness: appointment of
the Project Director and the three professionals for the Planning Unit of the
Ministry of Lands and Land Development, and appointment of the Project Coor-
dinators for the Forest Department and the University (Section 6.01(b), DCA).
Consultancy Services
40.     Whenever possible the project would use local consultants and experts
to complement project staff.  However, in view of the shortage of trained
staff in this sector in Sri Lanka, a considerable amount of technical assis-
tance, estimated in total at 218 man-months, would be required for the three
principal project components, i.e. 125 man-months for the Master Plan, 38
man-months for professional training, and 55 man-months for plantations. It
was agreed during negotiations that a consulting firm would be engaged to
provide the technical assistance services for the Master Plan and the planta-
tion activities. The appointment of such a firm would be a condition of
credit effectiveness (Section 6.01 (c), DCA). Technical assistance services
for the professional training program would be in the form of visiting
professors who would be recruited either individually or through an agreement
with an academic institution qualified to provide the services.



-14-
Monitoring and Evaluation
41.     The Planning Unit would be responsible for monitoring overall project
implementation based on information provided by the implementing agencies.
Quarterly reports would be prepared and submitted to GOSL and IDA. The
monitoring would focus on progress in civil works contracting and construc-
tion, procurement of equipment and materials, and consultancy services. In
addition, the University of Sri Jayawardenepura would collect and analyze
information on various aspects of professional training, the Forest Depart-
ment would collect data on plantation activities and technical training, and
the Planning Unit would provide key indicators on the progress in the
preparation of the Master Plan and the five-year investment program.
Project Cost and Financing
42.     The total cost of the project including duties and taxes (less than
US$0.1 million equivalent) is estimated at US$15.03 million equivalent, of
which US$4.7 million is foreign exchange. The cost estimates are based on
mid-1982 prices. Physical contingency of 3.7% of base cost and price contin-
gency of 59% of base cost are included. Price contingencies have been
estimated assuming annual inflation of 20% in 1982 and 1983, 15% in 1984, 12%
in 1985 and 10% in 1986 and thereafter for local costs; and 8% in 1982 and
1983, 7.5% in 1984, 7% in 1985 and 6% in 1986 and thereafter for foreign
costs.
43.     The proposed credit of US$9 million equivalent would finance about
60% of total project costs, including about US$6.33 million of local costs.
FINNIDA would contribute a grant of about US$2.44 million equivalent (16%) to
finance an estimated total of 168 man months of technical assistance at a
cost of US$14,500 per man month for the Master Plan and plantations; and GOSL
would contribute US$3.59 million (24%). Co-financing arrangements satisfac-
tory to IDA would be a condition of credit effectiveness (Section 6.01 (a),
DCA). In the event that FINNIDA's financing is not forthcoming, GOSL would
provide alternative financing from either some other donor or its own
resources.
Procurement and Disbursement
44.     Vehicles estimated at US$0.4 million would be procured through inter-
national competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines. Con-
tracts for other equipment and materials totalling US$0.9 million, but not
exceeding US$30,000 individually, would be too small to be suitable for ICB
and would therefore be procured through prudent shopping (comparing prices
from no less than three independent foreign or local suppliers). Proprietary
and specialized items, and seeds of special variety, estimated at a vaLue of
US$0.2 million would be procured through direct purchase. Where applicable,
local manufacturers would be given a preference margin of 15% on the c.i.f.
price of internationally offered items, or the relevant import duty,
whichever is lower. The civil works involved in the project are small and
scattered, and would not interest international bidders. Contracts for these



-15-
civil works (US$0.8 million in total) would be awarded on the basis of com-
petitive bidding advertized locally according to local procedures satisfac-
tory to IDA. Plantation activities (US$6.5 million) would be carried out
either under Forest Department force accounts or under contracts let through
competitive bidding advertised locally according to Government procedures
satisfactory to IDA. Consultant services to be financed by IDA (about US$1.1
million) would be procured in accordance with IDA's guidelines; the services
to be financed by FINNIDA (about US$2.4 million) would be procured following
FINNIDA's procedures. The experience and capability of the consultants to be
employed and their terms and conditions shall be satisfactory to IDA. The
balance of project costs would involve scholarships (US$0.2 million), operat-
ing costs (US$1.2 million), and salaries (US$1.3 million).
45.     Disbursement of the US$9 million credit would take place over a
period of seven years against the following items:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditure on directly imported vehicles, equip-
ment, furniture, books and materials (including plantation inputs)
or 100% of ex-factory costs if locally manufactured or 85% of
expenditures if procured locally (US$1.4 million);
(b) 100% of expenditure on technical assistance, consultants and
training abroad (US$1.2 million);
(c) 90% of expenditures on civil works construction under the project
(US$0.7 million); and
(d) 90% of expenditures on plantation establishment and management,
and on research and trial plots (US$5.7 million).
Project Benefits and Risks
46.     The direct quantifiable benefits of the project would be an increase
in wood production estimated at 7.3 million m3 over the rotation period (20
years) of plantations established or upgraded under the project. This is
equivalent to an increase in the annual wood supply of about 320,000 m3. The
market value of the total incremental output due to the project would be
about US$420 million in 1982 prices, representing about US$18 million per
annum over the rotation period of the crops and an equal amount in foreign
exchange savings. The project would also create about 2.7 million man-days
of employment for rural families in the project area over the five-year
planting period, generating an aggregate income of about US$3.2 million
equivalent. Based on four months work during the monsoon, this would provide
employment for about 5,000 laborers during the five-year period. The techni-
cal assistance program would help transfer the latest forestry technology to
Sri Lanka and strengthen the planning machinery for the sector. Domestic
training for professional staff is expected to save foreign exchange totall-
ing US$450,000 annually. The project would also have a positive environmen-
tal impact, e.g. in terms of helping prevent soil erosion.
47.     The economic rate of return has been estimated at 20% for the
industrial plantations which is the biggest component (42% of project costs).



-16-
No attempt has been made to calculate the economic rate of return for planta-
tion management activities (18% of project costs) due to the speculative
nature of the results. However, the rate of return of these activities would
be much higher than for the industrial plantations. The remainder of project
costs (40%) are for training, research and technical assistance and have,
therefore, not been included in the rate of return calculations. The sen-
sitivity analysis shows that the rate of return would not fall below the
opportunity cost of capital in Sri Lanka (12%) even if charged with the total
project cost or under such unlikely conditions as a 10-year lag in benefits.
48.     The project faces no major risks.  No particular difficulty is
anticipated in finding markets for the increased wood production due to the
project. The immediate production would find a market either substituting
for imports or supplying building poles, transmission poles or fuelwood. The
existing well-developed marketing organizations of the Timber Corporation and
the private sector would be able to handle it. The future output from thin-
nings and final harvesting in 20-years time of the bulk of plantations that
would be established under the project would fill only part of a projected
future wood deficit. A wood utilization consultant under the project would
provide advice on the utilization of plantation grown woods, particularly on
the use of eucalyptus which has not yet been used for timber in Sri Lanka,
but which is used elsewhere, e.g. in South Africa and Zambia. The provision
of technical assistance and funds for weeding would help ensure improvement
in the quality of plantations under the project. The provision of fire
protection, the planting of teak outside normal feeding areas and migrating
routes of elephants and the provision of guards for young plantations should
minimize the risk of damage by fire or animals.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.     The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of Sri
Lanka and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Comaittee provided
for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement are being dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors separately.
50.     Special conditions of the credit are listed in Section III of Annex
III. Additional conditions of credit effectiveness would be that: (a)
co-financing arrangements are satisfactory to IDA (para 43); (b) the Project
Director and the three professional staff for the Planning Unit have been
appointed (para 39); (c) the Project Coordinators for the Forest Department
and the University have been appointed (para 39); and (d) a consulting firm
has been appointed for the Master Plan and plantation activities (para 40).
51.     I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.

C. STATUS OF PROJECTS IN EXECUTION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 1982 1/
Cr. No. 666 - Tank Irrigation Modernization Project; US$5.0 million of
January 12, 1977; Effective Date: April 12, 1977; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
The project is making good progress. Staff positions and equipment
provided are sufficient to complete the project by end 1983, excluding some
drainage works and farm roads which have been deleted by the Government for
budgetary reasons. The water management program introduced in one tark area
during Maha 1980/81 went very well, but its envisaged extension to all five
tanks is slowly taking place.
1/  These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and, in particular, to report any
problems which are being encountered and the action being taken to remedy
them. They should be read in this sense and with the understanding that
they do not purport to present a balance evaluation of strengths and
weaknesses in project execution.

Cr. No. 701 - Mahaweli Ganga Development II Project; US$19.0 million of
June 27, 1977; Effective Date: December 29, 1977; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
With the exception of irrigation system infrastructure in one block
of the command area (about 1200 ac) and various buildings (about 580) throughout
System H, the construction of irrigation and social infrastructure in the
project area is essentially completed. Work remaining to be done is scheduled
for completion by early 1983. IDA has recommended that a massive and concerted
effort be made to make the irrigation system responsive and operational. The
Government agreed to establish a special construction unit to undertake the
needed modification and completion work, staffed by experienced and capable
technical staff.
Cr. No. 709 - Water Supply Project; US$9.2 million of June 30, 1977;
Effective Date: February 8, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1983
The Project has made good progress in completing the procurement of
equipment and materials and in advancing the construction of civil works.
The IDA Credit and the IDA-administered CIDA Credit are almost entirely
disbursed. Financial Management of the National Water Supply and Drainage
Board (WDB) has improved with WDB now producing the financial information
required for management. WDB's progress in implementing consumer metering
is now satisfactory as a result of steps taken to accelerate the program;
WDB is now experiencing the difficulties normally expected to accompany the
introduction of consumer billing and collection; measures are being taken
to alleviate the difficulties.
Cr. No. 818 - Tree Crop Rehabilitation (Tea) Project; U$21.0 million of
July 12, 1978; Effective Date: December 28, 1978; Closing
Date: December 31, 1984
Project progress is close to target for field work and the standard
of field operations is high. New factory equipment is improving tea quality
and reducing cost of production.  Housing has fallen behind schedule because
of escalating costs but the introduction of new designs and materials has
increased building momentum. The smallholder component has lagged behind
estate development because of weak smallholder extension; this position is
slowly improving.

Cr. No. 891 - Kurunegala Rural Development Project; US$20.0 million of
April 26, 1979; Effective Date: August 27, 1979; Closin&
Date: June 30, 1984
The project is generally on schedule; rural electrification works
have already been completed. Problems on quality of construction of
irrigation and education works were identified at early stage of project
implementation. Supervisory consultants, appointed for the Second Rural
Development Project (Cr. No. 1079), are helping to improve construction
activities. Improvements on the institutional arrangements for agricultural
credit, water management, and agricultural extension are somewhat slower
than expected. High cost overruns were noted in nearly all project
components. Efforts are being made to cut down cost by introducing farmers'
donated labor for some of the activities.
Cr. No. 900 - Road Maintenance Project; US$16.5 million of June 22, 1979;
Effective Date:  December 19, 1979; Closing Date:  June 30,
1984
A general 25% reduction in budget allocations 1981, followed by a
further 10%, has meant a rescheduling of proposed expenditures for the project.
This has been possible without sacrificing principal project objectives but
at the cost of deferring major rehabilitation work until towards the end of
the project. The allocation for 1982 has been increased to the original
estimate and it is expected that the project would be completed by midc-1984,
almost nine months later than estimated at appraisal.
Cr. No. 931 - Agricultural Extension and Adaptive Research Project; US$15.5
million of July 24, 1979; Effective Date: October 4, 1979;
Closing Date: June 30, 1985
The basic infrastructure and programs for providing agricultural
extension services in line with the T&V system have been established and the
Department of Agriculture is making steady progress in implementing the
system. Effective linkages have been established between research, training
and extension activities. Revised technical assistance and overseas
training programs have been agreed with Government and are being
implemented. Civil works started during the past two years have been
completed while vehicles and equipment for current requirements have been
procured. Disbursements have been slow due to delays in recruitment, civil
works, staffing, procurement and technical assistance program.

Cr. No. 942 - Small and Medium Industries Project; US$16.0 million of
July 24, 1979; Effective Date: October 23, 1979; Closing
Date: June 30, 1984
The principal objectives of the project would be to encourage and
assist growth and productivity improvement of small and medium firms,
defined as enterprises having plant and equipment valued at less than Rs 1
million, so as to increase their contribution to efficient low cost
employment creation, export expansion, regional development and economic
growth. The subloan amount has been fully committed, and
disbursements which have accelerated during the last six months, are
expected to be completed one year ahead of schedule. Most technical and
marketing service assistance activities have been launched.
Cr. No. 979 - Mahaweli Ganga Technical Assistance Project; US$3.0 million
of April 16, 1980; Effective Date: July 7, 1980; Closing
Date: December 31, 1983
A review of the final draft report for the Transbasin Diversion
Study was held in Colombo during March 1982. The consultant was asked to
complete some additional studies.
Cr. No. 994 - Road Passenger Transport Project; US$53.0 million of
April 16, 1980; Effective Date: October 27, 1980; Closing
Date: June 30, 1983
After a long delay by the beneficiary (SLCTB) in preparing bidding
documents for the procurement of the first batch of 660 bus chassis, a tender
was awarded in August 1981 and the first deliveries began in January 1982.
A second invitation to bid was issued in February 1982, and an award for 400
chassis is expected shortly. The SLCTB is preparing a third tender
for completely built buses.
Orders for workshop machinery, critical units and spares have been
delivered but disbursements are lagging.
Cr. No. 1017 - Smallholder Rubber Rehabilitation Project; US$16.0 million
of June 24, 1980; Effective Date: September 10, 1980;
Closing Date: June 30, 1986
The project continues to progress well. The replanting program in
particular is proceeding at above target levels. Distribution of fertilizer
is also taking place properly. Response by farmers to participate in
replanting under the project has been highly satisfactory.
The institution building aspects of the project have been progressing
slowly. This is not having serious repercussions on the physical implementation
of the project. However, measures are underway to speed up the institutional
aspects of the project.

Cr. No. 1020 - Telecommunicatons Project; US$30.0 million of June 24, 1980;
Effective Date: September 10, 1980; Closing Date: June 30,
1985
The Government has already established a separate Telecommunications
Department as part of organizational improvements under the project. The
Goverment has also increased overseas telephone and telex rates.
Procurement is about two to three months behind schedule bufi otherwise
proceeding well in accordance with the revised schedule.
Cr. No. 1041 - Water Supply and Sewerage II Project; US$30.0 million of
September 24, 1980; Effective Date: February 26, 1981;
Closing Date: September 30, 1985
WDB has appointed engineering consultants to supervise the
construction of the sewerage works under the Project and the financial
consultants for completion of WDB's organization management and financial
study. The project expenditures have been rephased to reflect the reduction
in local resource allocation during 1981. Procurement of materials and
equipment, and civil works for the major component of the water supply
project are proceeding according to the new agreed schedule.
Cr. No. 1048 - Sixth Power Project; US$19.5 million of September 24, 1980;
Effective Date: March 30, 1981; Closing Date: March 31,
1985
The IDA financed components are now proceeding satisfactorily. The
average tariff for power supplied by the Ceylon Electricity Board was increased
from about Rs 0.30 to Rs 0.58/kWh on October 1, 1980.  The LRMC tariff study
was recently completed and structural improvements are proposed as part of the
tariff increase scheduled prior to effectiveness of the Credit for the Seventh
Power Project. CEB has appointed consultants for a program of "restoration"
of systems and training: a comprehensive training program has been prepared
and implementation has started. Engineering consultants have been a?pointed
to design the project components to be financed by the Saudi Fund.
Cr. No. 1079 - Second Rural Development Project; US$33.5 million of
February 2, 1981; Effective Date: June 2, 1981; Closing
Date: June 30, 1986
The project is making satisfactory progress. Supervisory and
planning consultants have been appointed.  Project equipment, with the
exception of a few items, have been procured and handed otut to the
respective agencies. Construction programs for all components are generally
on schedule.

Cr. No. 1130 - Construction Industry Project; US$13.5 million of June 1,
1981; Effective Date: August 19, 1981; Closing Date:
December 31, 1984
Overall project progress is satisfactory and on schedule. Pilot
training programs for basic artisans in carpentry and masonry, and technical
site supervision started in August. The 'on-site' phase of these programs
have just began and are being monitored closely to determine whether the
downturn in the construction sector would seriously jeopardize this aspect of
the project. Programs in Plant Mechanics started in early October 1981, and
a Plant Operator course began in early November 1981.
Cr. No. 1160 - Village Irrigation Rehabilitation Project; US$30.0 million
of July 15, 1981; Effective Date: September 24, 1981;
Closing Date: December 31, 1986
Construction activities during 1981 fell slightly below appraisal
estimates manily due to budgetary constraints. The investigation program has
also lagged slightly behind schedule although this is not expected to affect
the 1982 program significantly. The institutional changes in the Department
of Agrarian Services in support of a systematic water management program have
been made, an adviser has been recruited and training programs initiated.
Procurement of equipment has proceeded on schedule and orders for the bulk
of equipment to be supplied under the project have been placed.
Cr. No. 1166 - Mahaweli Ganga Development Project III; US$90.0 million of
November 5, 1981; Effectiveness Date: February 8, 1982;
Closing Date: December 31, 1987
The credit became effective on February 8, 1982. Construction
of the Right Bank Transbasin Canal is somewhat behind schedule but the
quality of completed work is good. The contractor requested a contract
extension of seven months (from December 1981 to July 1982), but later
reduced the extension request to four months and is importing additional
equipment.
Cr. No. 1182 - Second Small and Medium Industries Project; US$30.0 million
of February 5, 1982; Effective Date: May 5, 1982;
Closing Date: December 31, 1985
Project implementation is underway.
