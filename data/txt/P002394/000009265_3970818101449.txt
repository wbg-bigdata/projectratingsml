PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
SIERRA LEONE - SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 573/EEC CREDIT 52-SL)
PREFACE
1.        A completion mission visited Sierra Leone in October 1983 to
compare the outcoce of the Second Education Project (Credit 573-SL) with
the objectives seecified at appraisal and in the Credit Agreement. The
Credit of US$7.25 million was approved by the Board of Executive Directors
in July 1975. The Credit was formally closed on December 31, 1982 and,
after half a year for finalizing accounts, a sum of US$129,740 remained
undisbursed and was cancelled on September 26, 1983, when the Credit
Account was closed.
2.        A Special Action Credit (EEC Credit 52-SL) of US$1.0 million to
support financing of the project was approved on May 30, 1980, with funds
contributed by the EEC member states. The funds were fully disbursed in
April 1982, and the Credit was then closed.
3.        Before the mission's arrival in the field, the Borrower prepared
a draft Project Completion Report (PCR), and supplementary studies which
examined the project's physical and educational implementation. The report
was generally satisfactory with regard to coverage and content. This full
IDA Completion Report takes into account the views presented by the
Government.
4.        The Operations Evaluation Department decided not to audit the
project and sent the PCR to the Borrower and its agencies for comment in
September 1984. Comments received from the Borrower have been taken into
account in finalizing the report and are reproduced as Attachment I to the
PCR.

PROJECT CQMPLETION REPORT
SIERRA LEONE - SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 573/EEC CREDIT 52-SL)
HIGHLIGHTS
Objectives
1.       The US$7.25 million IDA Credit and the US$1 million EEC Special
Action Credit financed a project designed to improve the efficiency and
quality of the Sierra Leonean educational system, and to adapt training
efforts to national needs by: (a) broadening the curricula offered,
especially to include science and technical pre-vocational and commercial
subjects at the lower secondary level; (b) expanding secondary level teacher
training programs for practical subjects to satisfy secondary school needs;
(c) creating a production capacity at the trade schools; (d) strengthening the
training capacity for rural health and community development services; (e)
improving the capacity of the Institute of Education in curriculum
development, materials support, teacher training, and research; (f) broadening
the scope of training opportunities in public administration and management;
and (g) strengthening the planning capacities of the University of Sierra
Leone and of the Ministry of Education (paras. 1.06 and 1.09).
Implementation
2.       Despite certain difficulties outlined below, implementation was
successful when viewed in terms of the regional and country context. This is
especially true when considering the serious economic problems which beset
Sierra Leone near the end of the implementation period. The Credit was
formally closed at the end of December, 1982, 27 months after the Closing Date
foreseen at appraisal. The project's objectives for civil works, equipment,
and furniture were fully met, although the civil works were completed about 42
months behind schedule, and furniture and equipment were not in place until
about 36 and 39 months, respectively, behind schedule. In addition to the
original construction program, six pilot primary schools were constructed in
selected rural locations as part of preparations for the Third Education
Project (Credit 1353-SL). The project's educational objectives were partly
met at completion (paras. 2.05, 2.08, 2.09, 2.14, 2.16, 3.03 and 6.01).
3.       Technical Assistance.  The  originally approved project provided for
49 manyears of expert services; five manyears were added during the project's
implementation.  Forty-nine manyears were actually used.  The implementation
arrangements were, however, changed substantially during implementation.
Local specialists were used more than anticipated, short-term consultants were
used rather than resident experts, and project-financed technical assistance
was closely coordinated with bilateral assistance. The originally approved
fellowship program included 18.5 manyears; this was increased to 21.5 manyears
during implementation. Nineteen and a quarter manyears were used. The
institutional objectives of the technical assistance program were achieved in
most cases. The possible exceptions involve the educational research and
planning components (paras. 2.20-2.22).



Outcomes
4.       Diversification of Curricula.  The broadening of curricula in
secondary education, especially at the junior secondary level, to include pre-
vocational subjects was a goal implemented with mixed success, although some
good curriculum development work was done by local and foreign specialists.
Success depended on actions by individual schools. The Government should
evaluate the outcome of this component before diversifying the curricula on a
nationwide basis (paras. 4.03 and 4.04).
5.       The Technical Teacher Training Department of the Milton Margai
Teachers College is operating well, but enrollments have been less than
expected. The training programs operated by the Ministry of Social Welfare's
National Training Center and the Institute of Public Administration and
Management (IPAM) are functioning effectively. Local staff gained
considerable experience by carrying out project support sector work and
project preparation activities (paras. 4.11, 4.12, 4.23, 4.26, 4.41 and 4.44).
6.       However, not all project components achieved their original
objectives. The production units in the trade schools never became
operational. The Research Division in the Institute of Education (IOE) and
the Planning Unit of the Ministry of Education (MOEPU) never solved important
staffing problems, and were unable to carry out their anticipated work
programs (paras. 4.36, 4.51 and 4.53).
Project Costs
7.       Overall project costs of US$10.7 million were 31% above appraisal
estimates in local currency, and 3% lower than appraisal in US dollars. The
IDA and EEC credits financed 75%, and the Government funded 25%, of project
costs. An amount of US$7.12 million was withdrawn from the original IDA
credit of US$7.25 million, and US$0.13 million was cancelled. The total
amount withdrawn from the original EEC credit of US$1.00 million, equivalent,
was only US$0.83 million, due to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the
dollar (para. 3.01).
The Government's Performance
8.       The Project Implementation Unit, (PIU), which was linked to the
Ministry of Finance, performed efficiently. The Unit was staffed by Sierra
Leonean nationals who handled the project's implementation well (paras. 2.04-2.05).
Lessons Learned
9.       Implementation and supervision taught IDA and the Government the
following lessons, which should be applied in future projects:
(a)  The large number of components and the many facets of education and
training (para. 1.09) included in this project made implementation
difficult. This lesson was applied to the design of the Third
Education Project, which was limited to primary education and related
services only (para. 6.02);



- vi -
(b) Availability of a revolving fund, regularly replenished by the
Government, would have had a positive impact on implementation.  The
Third Education Project therefore includes a Ba-k-financed revolving
fund to help alleviate constraints upon the Government's budget
(paras. 2.04 and 6.04);
(c)  The use of local consultants, backed up, when required, by short-term
foreign experts, was efficient. (The Bank's acceptance of local cost
financing made this arrangement possible.) Cooperation with
bilateral agencies for recruitment, training, and financing of
experts and fellowships was good also (paras. 2.19-2.21);
-           (d)  Part of the credit funds allocated for preparing a third education
project were used to build six pilot primary schools as prototypes
for establishing designs, construction and working methods, and costs
for schools in the Third Project.  Construction of these prototypes,
which was successful, helped the Third Project to an early and
efficient start (paras. 2.15 and 6.04);
(e) Support for production units attached to trade schools should be
reviewed very carefully in the future. The issues of financing and
competitiveness with private manufacturers should be studied before
appraisal (para. 4.19);
(f) The project created Instructional Resource Centers (IRCs) for in-
service training of teachers in new buildings located on the sites of
existing primary teacher training colleges outside Freetown. The new
IRCs were put under the management and leadership of the Director of
the IOE in Freetown. This division of responsibility-between the
principals of the colleges and the IOE Director-for activities and
staff on the same college campuses caused confusion in the management
and delayed the start of the IRC's educational activities. We should
avoid this type of dual management in future projects (para. 4.30);
and
(g) The Bank should be flexible when considering Government requests to
redesign implementation arrangements for project components because
of changed circumstances.  This is especially true for technical
assistance programs. In this project, the Bank's willingness to
finance local operating costs and supplies made possible a much
greater use of local specialists than originally anticipated, with
beneficial results for the project's institutional development
objectives (paras. 2.19 and 6.03).



I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
Education
1.01     Sierra Leone's educational system was originally patterned after the
British system, with which it maintains close links in terms ^f structure,
examinations, and professional qualifications of instructors. The primary
course of seven years is followed by a five-year secondary course leading to
the GCE Ordinary level. Some schools also offer a two-year Sixth Form program
to prepare pupils for the GCE Advanced Levels. Tertiary level education is
provided by five teachers colleges, two technical institutes, and the Fourah
Bay and Njala branches of the University of Sierra Leone.  English is the
official language and the language of instruction at all levels.
1.02     About 40% of the school-aged children are enrolled in primary
schools, while 85% of the population is illiterate.  About 15% of school-aged
children are enrolled in secondary schools. Most of them are enrolled in a
general education curriculum. About one-third of the students are girls.
Less than 1% of the relevant age group are enrolled in third level education.
1.03     The Ministry of Education has overall responsibility for formal
education. District Education Committees have been set up to operate the
schools within their jurisdictions. An estimated 10% of all students in
Sierra Leone are enrolled in private schools, which receive no Government
assistance. The University of Sierra Leone and its institutes have autonomous
status, but the University's budget is largely dependent upon Government
grants.
1.04     Two important exercises wei- undertaken during the r_rst half of the
1970s to study the shortcomings of the educational system, establish policy
objectives, and recommend ways of achieving them. First, the Ministry of
Education's Planning Unit (the MOEPU) worked closely with the Ministry of
Development in designing the educational program of the 1974-1979 National
Development Plan. Second, the University of Sierra Leone, in collaboration
with the Ministry of Education, sponsored an Education Review to help define a
long-term pattern of educational development for the country. Although the
two proposals differed in some respects, they both supported the overall goals
of: (a) more rapid expansion of primary education and related teacher
education; (b) deceleration of growth in secondary and university enrollments;
and (c) acceleration of growth in vocational and technical enrollments, and
greater alignment of the secondary and post-secondary programs with employment
needs.
1.05     Based on the planning documents and other information available, Bank
staff and Sierra Leonean officials held informal discussions during
implementation of the First Project about a possible second education
project.  A Unesco project identification mission visited the country in
January, 1973, to discuss the Government's strategy anid priorities, and to
identify areas for possible Bank assistance.  The Unesco mission was followed
up by a Bank mission to Sierra Leone in Februarv, 1973. Bank staff also
participated in the National Education Review Conference held in Freetown in
March, 1974.



-2-
Objectives
1.06     The Bank and the Government reached an understanding in September,
1974 that the Bank would be willing to support a project with the following
objectives:
(a)  reinforcing the objectives of the First Education Project in order to
diversify educational programs at the secondary level. This would
improve the employment prospects of vocational and general secondary
school graduates and align the programs more closely with real
employment needs;
(b)  strengthening the planning capability of the Ministry of Education
and the capacity of the Institute of Education in the areas of
curriculum development, materials support, teacher training, and
research; and
(c)  broadening the scope of training opportunities in public
administration and management and in training of rural development
personnel.
Preparation and Appraisal
1.07     A pre-appraisal mission visited Sierra Leone in July, 1974, following
which two senior officials of the Ministry of Education spent several weeks in
Washington preparing the project with the Bank's assistance. The First
Education Project's Implementation Unit, appropriate ministries, and the
University also assisted with the preparation. Final preparation of the
management and community worker training components was completed during
appraisal.
1.08     Appraisal was conducted in January and February, 1975.  The appraisal
mission investigated whether to include a University college to improve
training and strengthen the University's extension service. However, in view
of differences of opinion among the Ministries o' Agriculture and Education
and the University on the content, location, and management of the training
program, the appraisal mission decided not to include this proposed component
in the project. The mission instead suggested that the already-proposed
assistance to University planning should be used to help identify an
investment program for Njala College which would form part of a future
education project.
Project Components
1.09     The Credit Agreement signed on July 29, 1975, provided for US$7.25
million to finance a project comprising construction of facilities and the
provision of furniture, equipment, and materials for:
(a) 22 existing secondary schools;
(b) a technical teacher training program at the secondary teacher
college;
(c) improvement of three trade schools;



(d) the National Training Center at the Ministry of Social Welfare;
(e)  the planning sections of the Ministry of Education;
(f) the headquarters of the Institute of Education at Freetown and
Instructional Resource Centers at the five primary teacher colleges;
and
(g) an Institute of Public Administration and Management (IPAM.
The project also provided staff and equipment for the Project Unit, and
specialist services and fellowships to start up project institutions (except
for (a)), and support educational research, studies on primary education, and
the preparation of a University development plan. The project's design
followed the then-prevailing pattern: it had multiple objectives and
components scattered over various subsectors of formal and non-formal
education and training. As a result, project management was complicated and
there were delays in implementation.

II. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Credit Signing, Effectiveness and Closing
2.01     The IDA Credit Agreement was signed on July 29, 1975, for a credit of
US$7,250,000. The Project was declared effective on September 8, 1975. The
original Closing Date was September 30, 1980, but, since implementation
problems had delayed construction, the Association agreed to extend the
Closing Date to December 31, 1982 (para. 3.03).
2.02     Because of financial difficulties, the Government, on May 30, 1980,
signed a Special Action Credit Agreement for an amount of US$1,000,000
equivalent, contributed by the European Economic Community (EEC). This credit
became effective on June 12, 1980, the final disbursements were wade in April
1982, and the credit account was closed on September 26, 1982 (para. 3.03).
Project Management
2.03     Project implementation arrangements for the Second Education Project
were similar to those for the First Education Project (Cr. 170-SL). The
Project Implementation Unit, (PIU), established within the Ministry of
Finance, was responsible for monitoring implementation progress and
coordinating communications with IDA. The PIU also handled all physical
implementation (procurement and contract administration), and financial and
accounting matters. Responsibility for the implementation of software
(preparation of equipment specifications and terms of reference and
supervision specialists), was established according to the normal supervision
procedures within the ministry responsible for each project item.
2.04     The PIU was staffed by well-qualified Sierra Leoneans.  It performed
with great efficiency and responsibility, despite occasional funding problems
and country-wide economic problems, which resulted in constraints on the
Government's budget, balance-of-payment deficits, and import controls.  The
existence of a well-managed revolving fund, regularly replenished by the
Government, would have greatly facilitated implementation. Only towards the
end of the project, when budget constraints became severe and replenishment
slow, was implementation hampered. Therefore, while the PIU had some problems
with accounting and procuring equipment, it can take credit for an
implementation successful in a regional and country context, despite being
carried out under difficult conditions.
2.05     The PIU worked well with senior MOE officials.  However,
implementation of the software for the Education Planning Unit and Research
components suffered as a result of the deteriorating economic environment.
The constraints on the Government's budget during the implementation period
caused a reduction in real civil service salaries of nearly 50%. As a result,
morale declined, and retaining and recruiting qualified staff became
increasingly difficult. Both the Senior Research Officer (in the Institute of
Education) and the Deputy Chief Education Officer (in the Ministry of
Education's Planning Unit) resigned early in the project and were never
replaced, and the project's institutional objectives for components under
their jurisdiction were only partly achieved. Despite these problems,
implementation, as a whole, can be considered successful when viewed in terms
of the regional and country context.

Design
2.06     At appraisal, it was agreed that locally based architects, engineers,
and quantity surveyors would be selected to prepare all design and tender
documents. As the Government decided it wanted to deal with only one
consulting firm, a consortium was established, and, finally, appointed when
its fee of 11.1% of construction costs was agreed upon.
2.07     The consortium started design work in early 1976. Tenders were
grouped into seven contract packages according to the project institutions'
geographical locations, and awarded in phases. The last tender documents were
completed in April, 1979, about one year later than estimated at appraisal.
This delay was largely attributable to late completion of the engineering
drawings. The consortium's performance was, in general, satisfacZ ry.
2.08     The total area built was about 22% larger than planned at
appraisal. The difference is mainly due to a larger circulation area for
covered walkways between buildings. The increased area is justified, since
weather protection is needed in the rainy climate. The buildings are
functional, economical, and designed simply. Most of the buildings have been
in operation for several years and provide acceptable, year-round comfort in
teaching and dormitory areas. The completion mission observed, however, that
during the rainy season the roofs leaked -a problem resulting from faulty
construction- and did not sufficiently protect the exterior walls. The water
supply has, in many locations, been a major problem, due to limited power for
pumping water. Consequently, generators and water wells were provided to
schools located in areas without a water supply and electric power from the
main. Operating these generators has been a financial burden to the
schools. Some of the schools can only afford to use the generators for part
of the school day.
2.09     In the context of the studies on the development of primary education
and the preparation of a Third Education project, six pilot primary schools
were built under this project in order to help experiment with different
designs, and to determine cost and working methods as preparation for the
construction of about 500 primary school classrooms under the Third Education
Project (Cr. 1353-SL). Two basic types of classrooms (square and L-shaped)
were built (para. 2.15).
Sites
2.10     Adequate land was available for the originally proposed expansion of
existing institutions. However, three of the sites, in the Freetown area,
were on steeply sloping terrain and, therefore, were expensive to build
upon. All sites provided for the six pilot primary schools had reasonably
good direct access, except for one site where an access road had to be built.
Construction
2.11     Applications for pre-qualification through ICB procedures were
received from 17 contractors, of which six were from outside Sierra Leone.
Nine contractors, all operating in Sierra Leone, were prequalified for
tendering.



-6-
2.12     The contractors' performance for each of the seven contract packages
varied. One contractor caused delays through poor management, wbich included
weak site organization and a frequent lack of readily available materials.
Construction coincided with the unforeseen weakening of the local currency,
which occurred in late 1978, and the introduction of import controls.
Consequently, materials were frequently in short supply.
2.13     The day-to-day construction supervision was carried out by five
qualified clerks-of-works appointed by the PIU. Their supervision of the
contractors was, in most cases, satisfactory. Site foremen were stationed on
the sites at all times, and had a positive impact on the quality of the
construction.
2.14     The construction of the original components started in April, 1977,
(about six months behind appraisal estimates), and six contract packages were
completed in February, 1982, (about 30 months behind the appraisal
estimate). The Shenge Secondary School, which is one of the most remote, and
which was included in the last contract package, was completed only in April,
1983. These construction delays can be attributed largely to: (a) late
completion of tender documents; (b) managerial site problems of some
contractors; (c) roads which were impassable during the rainy season; (d)
import restrictions and shortages of building materials; (e) theft of building
materials; and (f) lengthy delays by some contractors in repairing defective
work. A detailed implementation status table is shown in Annex 1.
2.15     Of the pilot primary schools (para. 2.09), three were built by direct
labor ("self-help"), and three were built by small rural contractors.
Construction began in March, 1982, and was completed by December, 1982. The
bulk of the building materials were procured and delivered to the site through
the PIU. An evaluation of the pilot project carried out by the PIU showed
that the self-help and cooperation by the villagers was, in most cases, not as
enthusiastic as expected, with the exception of limited assistance on site
clearing, and could not be relied upon. The report also indicated that with a
regular supply of building materials to the sites, the small contractors could
construct a 3-classroom school within six months. Square-shaped classrooms
(with metal roofs) were about 27% more expensive to build than L-shaped
classrooms (with timber roofs). Furniture bids indicated that hardwood
furniture cost less than wooden furniture with metal or plastic parts. Also,
hardwood furniture is more suitable in remote rural areas, since it can be
more easily repaired. It also became clear that a good-sized revolving fund
managed by the PIU would be essential for the smooth implementation of the
primary school construction program and the use of small local contractors.
Furniture, Equipment, and Materials
2.16     The PIU prepared all furniture, equipment, and building material
lists and tender documents, and supervised the procurement and distribution of
goods to project institutions. The bulk of the furniture was procured through
ICB, in five bid packages. Contracts were awarded in February, 1980. One
foreign manufacturer won a bid package, while the other four went to local
manufacturers (about 70% of the total cost). All equipment, vehicles and
materials were procured through ICB, with the exception of items for the pilot
primary schools. Equipment and materials were submitted for tendering in five
bid packages, and contracts were awarded between April and October, 1980, to



foreign suppliers. Additional equipment contracts were awarded in early
1982. The timing of delivery of furniture and equipment was arranged in order
to coincide with the completion of civil works contracts, since the Government
did not have storage facilities. The quality and quantity of furniture and
equipment was generally satisfactory. The production units of the trade
centers appeared, however, to be over-supplied with equipment relative to the
floor space (para. 4.18). Few or no books were supplied to the libraries. A
detailed implementation status is given in Annex 2.
Maintenance of Facilities
2.17     Maintenance of public buildings is the responsibility of the Ministry
of Works, but the Ministry's maintenance budget is inadequate even to carry
out small repairs. Maintenance of buildings may increasingly become a
problem. As the institutions age, the schools are trying to find ways to get
funds to carry out the most urgent maintenance, for instance, by earmarking a
portion of school fees for maintenance or through help from Parent/Teacher
Associations. Schools operated by religious missions use part of their fees
for maintenance work, and maintenance of furniture and equipment is the
responsibility of the schools. Perhaps this could be a way to arrange for
maintenance of the schools under the maintenance jurisdiction of the Ministry
of Public Works.
Covenants
2.18     The Government fulfilled all covenants with the exception of the
covenant under Section 2.02(b) regarding the Planning Unit in the Ministry of
Education (MOEPU). The MOEPU is operating and has made substantial
contributions to the preparation of the Third Education Project, but did not
receive staff and budget allocations as specified in the Credit Agreement
(para. 4.51). Three covenants, Section 3.06 (requirement for fellowship
holders to serve in relevant positions for two years), Section 4.05
(establisbment of tracer systems), and 4.06 (operation of production units)
were partly accompl±shed. Annex 6 provides details on compliance with the
Credit Agreement.
2.19     The project, as appraised, included 49 manyears of specialist
services, and five more were added in 1979. Details on the technical
assistance component can be found in Annexes 3 and 8. The technical
assistance component was, on the whole, implemented successfully, and has a
number of interesting features. These include a deliberate effort to maximize
the use of local specialists, backed up, when necessary, by short-term
consultants, and an expanded fellowship program; close cooperation with
bilateral assistance (in particular the British Council); interviewing of
candidates for technical assistance posts by Sierra Leonean staff; and
substantial modifications of original implementation arrangements to fit
evolving circumstances.
2.20     The appraisal mission envisaged the use of local specialists for
curriculum development and the studies to be carried out by the Planning Unit
of the MOE and the Research Unit of the IOE. Expatriates were expected to be
needed for the other specialist positions supported under the project.
However, in 1976 the Government redesigned the technical assistance component
regarding establishment of the Ministry of Social Welfare's National Training



-.; 8 -.
Center (NTC). It proposed instead to recruit a local taskforce to carry out
the envisaged studies and curriculum development. This task force would be
trained and supported by a team from the London School of Economics, which
would be available for a series of short-term consultancies. IDA approved
this arrangement, and the work was carried out quite successfully. Similar
arrangements with support from Unesco and private consultants were made for a
sector review and the preparation of the third educ-ation project. These were
equally successful. IDA supported this reliance on local consultants
throughout project implementation by agreeing to changes in the anticipated
implementation structure, and by approving the Government's request for local
cost financing (stipends, travel and subsistence costs, office supplies,
etc.).
2.21    The cooperation with bilateral technical assistance agencies for
recruitment and financial support also worked well. The PIU worked very
closely with the British Council throughout implementation on the MMTC, IPAM,
and NTC components. The Inter-University Council (UK) provided assistance for
the University Planning and IPAM components. CIDA provided an equipment
procurement specialist to the PIU (1978-1980) and three manyears to IPAX.
USAID provided the Planning Unit with a Peace Corps volunteer to help
establish an educational data collection system. All these inputs were
closely linked and well-coordinated by the PIU, and technically supervised by
the implementing agencies.
2.22    The resignation of two key officials (IOE's Senior Research Fellow
and the head of the Planning Unit (paras. 4.36 and 4.51), and the difficulties
in finding su'ftable replacements, made technical assistance to these units
more necessary than anticipated at appraisal. Assistance was provided for the
PU and was beneficial, but the Research Unit's problems remained unsolved.

III. COST AND FINANCE
Capital Costs
3.01     A comparison of appraisal estimates with actual costs for physical
facilities is shown in the following table, and details can be found in
Annexes 7 and 8. The total estimated project cost, including contingencies,
was Le. 9.16 million at appraisal, or US$ 10.99 million equivalent. The IDA
credit of US$ 7.25 million excluding taxes and customs duties was expected to
cover the foreign exchange component, representing 66% of total project costs,
net of taxes. As implemented, the final project cost was Le. 11.96 million,
or TUS$ 10.66 million equivalent, about 30% higher than appraisal estimates in
Leones and 3% lower in US dollars.  The IDA and EEC credits financed 75% of
the final costs, while the Governiment covered 25%. The wide difference
between Leones and dollars can largely be attributed to inflationary effects
of the fluctuation of the US dollar and the weakening of the Leone. The
exchange rate at the time of appraisal was US$ 1.0 equalled le. .83, but US$
1.0 equalled Le. 1.25 by the Closing Date. Claims reimburseI after the
Closing Date were based on a ratio of Le. 2.50 to US$1 due to devaluation of
the Leone in July 1983.

3.02     Costs (in US$) were roughly in line with appraisal estimates, with
the exception of project preparation work, which was much more extensive than
envisaged at appraisal, and which included complete design work for all
project components and the construction and equipping of six pilot primary
schools. The technical assistance cost was lower than the appraisal estimate
because bilateral financial support was greater than expected.

Disbursements
3.03     The original Closing Date of September 30, 1980, for the IDA Credit
was extended to December 31, 1982. During implementation, the original
disbursement percentages as stated in Schedule 1 of the Credit Agreement were
revised (Letters of September 15, 1977 and October 27, 1980). The final
disbursement of the IDA Credit was US$7,120,259.19.  The savings of US$
129,740.81 were cancelled on September 9, 1983. (The savings were due to the
devaluation, which occurred in July, 1983 (pars. 3.01)). The EEC funds of US$
1.0 million equivalent were originally a basket of European currencies;
because of increases in the dollar value during implementation, only US$
830,081.73 remained available for final disbursement. The exchange rates are
summarized in the Key Project Data section of this report, and the original
allocations and actual disbursements by category are shown in Annex 9.
Recurrent Costs
3.04     The overall recurrent cost of the new and extended project
institutions in 1982-83 was about Le. 5.3 million (US$4.2 million), which is
equivalent to about 2% of the total 1981-82 recurrent Government budget, and
about 10% of the MOE's 1981-82 estimated total recurrent budget. The unit
recurrent costs are shown in the table below.

NOTE:  A recent study conducted in Tanzania by the Wcrld Bank estimated unit
costs for similar types of secondary education at US$ 250.
The incremintal recurrent cost of the project itself is, in fact, rather
limited, since it would concern only the Technical Teacher Training Department
of the MMTC, IPAM, the operating cost of the IRCs and the new facilities at
the secondary schools and the trade centers. The completion mission was not
able to isolate these costs, but has no reason to believe that the estimates
of the appraisal mission (2.5% of the MOE budget) were incorrect.



IV. EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES
A. Secondary Schools
Objectives
4.01     The First Education Project in Sierra Leone supported the
introduction of practical subjects in the curricula ("diversification") to
better prepare secondary school students for employment. The basic objective
of the secondary school component of the Second Project was to broaden the
curricula, especially at the lower secondary level, to include science and
technical/pre-vocational and commercial subjects by adding laboratories,
workshops, and equipment to existing schools. The addition of facilities to
the schools was also expected to result in a slight increase in enrollment,
espec'ally among girls, and to support the Government's efforts to make use of
the schools more efficiently.
Outcome
4.02     The physical resources provided under the Second Project (buildings,
equipment, and furniture) were provided largely as planned and have
established the appropriate environment for the diversification program.
However, implementation of other necessary measures, such as curriculum
planning and development, staffing, and the supply of expendable materials,
were less successfully carried out (paras. 4.03 to 4.07).
Curriculum Planning
4.03     The Institute of Education developed curricula for academic subjects,
and the Ministry of Education developed curricula for technical/vocational
subjects.  The Government did not issue an official policy on the
diversification of curricula. The new timetables were, therefore, for the
most part designed internally in the schools and the curricula were applied on
the professional judgement of the school staff and the available educational
and physical resouces.  Thus, some schools offered two periods per week of
practical subjects at the junior level only, while others offered practical
subjects at the junior level and full streams in fields like woodwork and home
economics at the senior level. The Ministry of Education and the Institute of
Education gave little or no guidance to the schools on goals and educational
planning methods, both of which were needed to effectively and economically
introduce the broader curricula and make efficient use of the new facilities.
4.04     The problem of staffing for the diversified curricula was both
quantitative and qualitative, and tended to be more serious for the
technical/vocational subjects. Home economics, agriculture, and science were
also affected. Commerce was somewhat better off than the technical/vocational
subjects. Finding the staff to teach the traditional academic subjects in
secondary education did not cause more problems than the ones experienced
before the introduction of the diversified curricula, since the schools had
prior experience with these subjects and already had a core of academic staff
available.
4.05     Quantitatively, the problem stemmed from the generally low supply of
trained teachers in technical/vocational subjects. In addition, the envisaged
output of technical teachers from the new Department of Technical Teacher



- 12 -
Training at the MMTC, financed by the project, did not materialize at the
planned rate due to: (a) a delayed start; and (b) a shortage of candidates for
training. Thus, the department had produced, after two years of operation,
only 13 technical teachers instead of the 40 envisaged at appraisal (para.
4.12). In addition, there was no obligation for these teachers to serve in
the project schools, so these schools had to compete with established non-
project schools to attract the small output of technical teachers. Many of
the project schools were especially disadvantaged in this competition by their
location in rural areas where there was inadequate housing.
4.06     Qualitatively, the project schools also were at a disadvantage,
especially in the technical/vocational fields. Because of the limited supply
of candidates and the small output of technical/vocatio-l teachers from the
MMTC, the project schools had to rely to a great extent on skilled workers
with City and Guild certificates from the trade schools, but no pedagogical
training.
Operating Expenditures
4.07     Many of the schools could not operate their programs efficiently
because of a lack of money for operating costs. Some principals said that
they had not received funds for expendable materials for three years. Some
schools, therefore, charged additional fees to meet operating costs.  Whether
schools did this depended to a great extent upon the calibre of the school
administrators and staff, and their commitment to the success of the school
programs.
Eurollments
4.08     Enrollments in the extended secondary schools increased as had been
expected at appraisal, thanks partly to the addition of teaching space, but
partly also due to more efficient use of the facilities arranged to meet the
continually growing demand for student places (Annex 5). School officials
believed that the proportion of girls in secondary education increased, but it
was not possible to determine the exact size of the increase because of
inadequate educational data in Sierra Leone. This deficiency of statistical
data is being dealt with in the Third Education Project through support to the
MOE's Planning Unit.
Conclusions
4.09     The project secondary schools have been in operation in their new
facilities for only two to three years, and the students in the project
schools have not yet followed a full cycle of secondary education in project-
financed facilities.  In addition, the MMTC technical teacher training program
is still in its infancy, and has produced only a small number of teachers with
training suitable for running diversified programs. To take full advantage of
the program, the Government should study the experience gained by the schools
during the "pilot period" of secondary school development under the project,
and use the experience gained by the schools to establish a national policy to
implement diversified curricula.



- 13 -
B. Technical Teacher Training
Objectives
4.10     The technical teacher training component was intended to support the
introduction of technical/vocational and commercial subjects (a
"diversification of curricula") in the secondary schools, (para. 4.01), by
supplying physical facilities and technical assistance to the Milton Margai
Teachers College.
Curricula and Courses
4.11     Since Sierra Leone had no prior experience in training secondary
school teachers in technical/vocational and commercial subjects, the
Government had to rely on technical assistance from abroad for curricula
development and teaching the courses.  Difficulties in recruiting the Chief
Technical Advisor delayed start-up. Once the technical assistance team was
ready, foreign staff and the staff of the MMTC cooperated well. The foreign
staff made its most important contribution during the initial curricula
development and course design periods, and the local input was more important
during later stages of implementation. Design of the curricula was completed
in 1982. Practical subjects were balanced well with other subjects, meeting
the students' training needs. Efforts had also been made to coordinate the
training programs with the existing conditions in the secondary schools. The
MMTC training program graduates, and the principals under whom they worked,
expressed satisfaction with the training that had been offered at the MNTC.
The mission's visit to the secondary schools occurred during vacation time, so
it saw no teachers teaching. However, earlier supervision visits confirm the
views of the principals.
Output of Graduates
4.12     The MMTC has so far not been able to produce the nunber of teachers
planned at appraisal (para. 4.05). The projected and actual outputs for the
two first years are shown below:
Subjects
Technical
Vocational       Secretarial        Business
Planned                     40                 20               20
Actual                      13                  9               25
Deficit/Surplus            -27                -11               +5
The two most obvious reasons for the low output are stringent entrance
requirements and low salaries for the teachers after graduation. Few
applicants for technical/vocational subjects had four ordinary level passes,
as required. The Government, therefore, admitted a few very qualified skilled
workers with City and Guild certificates. The courses for secretarial
teachers did not attract the expected applicants since a trained secretary
with the entrance qualifications for teacher training would, without attending
the teacher training program, get a better salary in the private sector than
as a trained teacher. The only program that attracted a full number of



- 14 -
applicants was business. The MMTC staff said this was because these graduates
were attractive to the private sector.
Conclusion
4.13     The teacher training program had a mixed outcome.  The technical
assistance staff and the local staff performed their work on curricula
development and teaching acceptably. The quality of the graduates was
satisfactory, too, but the number of graduates has, so far, been a
disappointment. No tracer study has been made, but information received from
the MMTC and from the schools the mission visited indicates that only about 15
graduates from the project-sponsored teacher training programs are teaching in
diversified secondary schools. The main reason, according to some school
principals, that so few of the graduates are going into the new diversified
schools is tlat most of the project secondary schools are in remote locations
without proper housing (para. 4.05).
4.14     The Government has started discussions on what measures to take to
increase the teacher training output, but concrete solutions had not yet been
found by the time of the completion mission's visit. The outcome of these
discussions should be monitored in connection with supervision of the Third
Education Project, now being implemented.
C. Trade Centers
Objectives
4.15     The project was intended to: (a) introduce basic theoretical concepts
in the curricula of the three trade centers at Kissy, Magburaka, and Kenema in
order to give students a better basis for training and upgrading their skills;
and (b) place the trainees in an environment which would simulate industrial
conditions. To this end, the project provided academic facilities for all
three trade centers and facilities for production units (workshops) at
Magburaka and Kenema.
Broadening of Curricula
4.16     The Government used the services of an ILO team of technical
assistance experts to develop curricula, including academic concepts, and to
introduce the new curricula in the trade centers. Success was limited. The
main obstacle to the introduction of more academic content in the curricula
appeared to be lack of commitment to the new concepts by teachers, students,
and the Government. Since the goal of the trade centers was to help the
students to pass the City and Guilds of London Certificate, the teachers in
general did not apply academic concepts in their teaching other than those
required for the City and Guilds Certificate. And the Ministry of Education,
formally responsible for the curricula changes, doesn't seem to have played a
major role in implementing the change in curricula.
Establishment of Production Units
4.17     Kissy Trade Center has, since the 1960s, produced school furniture
for the Ministry of Education in its production unit. The MOE has funded the
activity. In order to promote similar activities at other centers, the Second



- 15 -
Project financed the construction of facilities for production units at the
Magburaka and Kenema centers. The production units would be established
primarily to produce furniture for sale to the primary schools and thus be
self-supporting financially. The intention was to have autonomous units with
their owr. accounting systems and staff, and to give students the opportunity
to undertake industrial training.
4.18     The preduction unit facilities were constructed and the equipment
delivered to the trade centers at the time of the completion mission's visit,
but the units were not operating. The MOE did not allocate staff positions to
the units, and no operating funds were available. Besides this, too much
equipment appears to have been supplied in view of the size of the production
workshops. Some equipment, therefore, was kept temporarily with other
departments of the centers. One center was already expanding with "self-help"
(from students), and the other had plans to build another workshop to house
the equipment and to expan-d its planned activities.
Conclusions
4.19     This project component had not achieved its objectives at the time of
completion. Broader curricula, as expected at the time of appraisal, had not
been implemented and the production units were not in operation. The
mission's discussions indicated that this component had not been fully thought
out during preparation. If the curriculum proposals had been linked to a
revision of examination requirements, they probably would have been accepted
more readily by the centers. In addition, the plans for the activities of the
production units should have been preceded by studies on which products could
be produced and sold, what legal and what financing measures would be
required, and what the comparative advantage was of having the Ministry of
Education as manufacturer as compared to private sector manufacturers.
4.20     It is premature to speculate on the long-term outcome of the efforts
to start production units. But, if a component of this kind were to be
included in a project today, experience would have suggested establishing the
unit with some kind of legal and financial autonomy and providing it with
adequate initial working capital to start production. To take advantage of
the funds already invested, the Government should explore the possibility of
establishing the units initially as repair and maintenance centers for school
furniture.
D. Social Welfare National Training Center
Objectives
4.21     The objective of this project item was:
(a) to strengthen the programs for training rural health and development
workers; and
(b) to supply the National Training Center, (NTC), at Bo with new
physical facilities.



- 16 -
Implementation
4.22     The preparation for the training programs for rural development
workers was carried out by a local task force (para. 2.20) in four phases:
(a) a survey and analysis of skill requirements; (b) program development; (c)
pilot training; and (d) evaluation. The first report was issued in 1977. The
design of the program and the supporting physical facilities was aimed at
upgrading about 150 social development workers for service in a variety of
professional activities such as: (a) promoting health, nutrition, and better
sanitation; (b) instructing women's groups; (c) undertaking youth work; (d)
helping needy families; and (e) establishing a variety of self-help programs.
4.23     About 120 of the 150 rural development workers in the Ministry of
Social Welfare have been trained since the program began. The final group
will complete its studies this year. The program requires 12 months at the
NTC campus and six months 'a selected villages in the Bo area. Besides the
traditional field activities described above (para. 4.22), the NTC students
initiate road construction, irrigation schemes, bridge construction, housing
programs, etc. After completing the NTC program, the students receive a
General Certificate of Rural Development. The training program is relevant to
village needs, as evidenced by the great demand from the villages for help
from the trainees.
Problems
4.24     Cercain problems, nearly all caused by the severe constrai-nts on the
Government budget, emerged during implementation and will need to be addressed
by the Ministry of Social Welfare. They include the following:
(a) the NTC has not yet obtained permanent staff. Its courses are taught
by part-time staff on loan from the Ministry and District offices;
(b)  the number of rural development workers increased only marginally
during implementation, which indicates a relative decrease in
services provided by the workers in relation to the growing
population;
(c)  the rural development workers get no salary increase after the 18-
month training course, and there are few prospects for promotion.
This creates disappointment and frustration; and
(d) the allocation of funds for rural field projects is very limited.
This means that rural development workers have few opportunities to
apply their knowledge.
4.25     The Ministry of Social Welfare is reviewing these and other problems
and preparing a plan for the further development of the NTC. One possibility
is to use the NTC for comprehensive training programs for staff from the
different ministries involved in rural comprehensive/coordinated development,
e.g., in the fields of agriculture, health, and civil works.
Conclusions
4.26     This component has been successfully implemented in a very systematic



- 17 -
manner and has stirred great interest for several reasons. These include:
(a) the participation of foreign organizations such as the British Council and
ILO; (b) the extensive travel by Sierra Leonean staff to other countries for
consultations and studies of related projects; and (c) the participation by
staff in fellowship training. Many rural development specialists from abroad
have visited the NTC and benefited from Sierra Leone's successful
implementation experience.
E. Institute of Education
Objectives
4.27     The basic objectives of this component were to strengthen Institute
of Education (IOE) activities in in-service training of teachers, curriculum
development, materials production, and educational research. The project was
expected to support these activities by supplying a headquarters building,
including an Instructional Resource Center (IRC), in Freetown, and one IRC in
each of four Primary Teachers Colleges outside the capital. The IOE would
administer the activities at the IRCs.
Implementation
4.28     The IOE and the IRCs.  The headquarters buildings have been completed
and are now occupied by the IOE. The IRCs are in use for in-service training
of educational staff and other related activities. The IRC facilities are
also used by the Colleges for pre-service training, especially for production
of educational materials, the use of audio-visual aids, and demonstrations.
4.29     Part-time in-service training tutors appointed by the Ministry of
Education now manage the IRC activities. The tutors were trained in England
for a year through the British Council, and are college staff members despite
their part-time status. The full-time IRC administrators are expected to be
appointed by the MOE soon.
4.30     The dual leadership of the IRCs by the IOE and the colleges has
caused some controversy and some delays in starting activities at the IRCs.
An earlier supervision mission proposed that the colleges have jurisdiction,
with the IOE retaining the rights to use the facilities for in-service
training and upgrading of its staff, and related activities.  The MOE is
considering such an arrangement.
4.31     The Curriculum Development Unit.  The Curriculum Development Unit
(CDU) of the IOE continued its work on secondary school curricula for English,
mathematics, science, and social sciences started under the First Education
Project. The CDU showed great dedication and continued work during
implementation of the Second Project, despite serious problems in finding
funds to pay key staff after 1980, when IDA's financing of the technical
assistance for curriculum development ended. The CDU was, according to the
appraisal plans, also expected to maintain close links with the MMTC in
working on new technical/vocational curricula, and to use a technical
assistance specialist on curriculum development (to be funded by the UK).
This plan did not materialize.  The MMTC instead worked on its own and
established its own contacts with the secondary schools. The Ministry of
Education retained its responsibility for development of curricula for home



- 18 -
economics, liberal arts, and agriculture. This was another complication.
4.32     On the whole, the CDU seems to have had only a limited impact on the
introduction of more diversified curricula in the secondary schools. However,
its experienced staff had a catalytic effect on curriculum development in
general, especially through using the CDU staff as lecturers and instructors
at workshops and seminars on curriculum development. Nevertheless, the CDU's
impact on efforts to broaden the secondary school curricula could have been
greater had the Government provided more moral support, and greater financial
backing.
4.33     Materials Production Unit.  A lack of proper staff caused the
Materials Production Unit (MPU) to have start-up problems. But, toward the
end of implementation, the British Council supplied the IOE with a competent
and enthusiastic expert on materials production who helped improve the
situation. The facilities and materials provided to the Institute for the MPU
under the project were, therefore, in use at the time of completion, and the
MPU was making an impressiJe effort to develop simple teaching materials for
primary schools. The MPU also conducted in-service training of teachers and
arranged demonstrations and films on educational matters in the Freetown IRC.
These activities were being extended to the other IRCs. Special attention was
given initially to the Makeni IRC, where the British Council was funding a
pilot program for production of materials for primary schools by the college
students. Many useful (and easily reproducible) teaching materials were
already on display in this IRC at completion, and in-service tra'ning courses
for teachers and demonstrations for school classes were being conducted. The
Bununbu IRC was in full and impressive action under the sponsorship of the
UNDP.
Research
4.34     An educational review conducted in the early l970s by the University
of Sierra Leone, in cooperation with the Ministry sf Education, resulted in a
number of ideas for improvements of the educaL onal system. Most of the ideas
were new and untested in Sierra Leone, and needed systematic research and
experimentation before being applied. The Government, therefore, decided to
establish a Research Unit in the Institute of Education. The full-time
research staff was intended to consist of a senior research fellow, a research
fellow, and a research assistant. The Unit would make wide use of part-time
help from teachers.
4.35     The plans for research presented in the appraisal report were
extensive.  The project would finance, within the Institute of Education,
pilot studies related to improving and extending elementary education, such as
tre use of radio and published support materials, educational needs as
perceived by rural communities, conditions for mobilization of community
support, and profiles of instructors for community education. The studies
would also have served to identify projects for inclusion in a possible third
education project.
4.36     A senior research fellow was appointed in 1975 but resigaed one year
later, leaving the other employee, a research assistant, in charge (para.
2.22). The research assistant was later appointed to be research fellow. The
original plan for staffing the Research Unit was not fulfilled. At the time



- 19 -
of completion, the Unit had only one staff member-the research fellow-and no
secretarial staff at all.
4.37     In spite of its staff constraints, the Unit has, as part of the
strategy for extending the education base, done some useful research.  For
example, it undertook a detailed analysis of school enrollmnet data and
published a study entitled "Final Report on Access to Schools: Primary and
Secondary Data" (1978). A second report, "Planning for Primary and Secondary
Education: Access and School Performance," is now being prepared.
4.38     In addition to the studies conducted by the Research Unit, impressive
studies have been conducted both together and separately by the Ministry of
Education, (the Planning Unit and Institute of Education), and the Ministry of
Social Welfare. These studies reflect the thoughts and plans of the appraisal
report, but the scope and terms of reference were substantially modified with
IDA's agreement to respond to the changed circumstances three or four years
after appraisal, and different priorities for studies than those foreseen at
appraisal. The Ministry of Social Welfare, in cooperation with the Project
Implementation Unit in 1977, completed and presented the study "Needs Service
Study of Villages," which included an assessment of rural area basic needs.
This survey served as a basis for developing training curricula for rural
development workers and for developing village projects (para. 4.24). An
Education Sector Survey, completed in 1979, covered policy and planning issues
in education. The survey served as a basis for the preparation of the Third
Education Project. A report prepared in 1983 by the PIU as preparation for
the Third Project described six pilot primary schools (para. 2.15) constructed
under the Second Project and included evaluations of design, construction,
materials, transportation problems, village participation in construction, and
so forth. The study was useful in designing and implementing the Third
Project (para 2.13). These and other studies funded by IDA made useful
contributions to the development of education in Sierra Leone (Annex 8, para
9).
Conclusions
4.39     The Institute of Education, during implementation, evolved from an
institution concerned mainly with curriculum development, to a comprelensive
Institute with good physical facilities and other resources in Freetown and
extensions to the provinces through the teachers colleges and the IRCs.
Despite the problems with institution-building and the supply of resources,
described above, there is evidence that the implementation effort has been
successful. The Institute, supplied with good leadership and sufficient
staff, will no doubt play a key role in educational development in Sierra
Leone.
F. Institute of Public Administration and Management (IPAM)
Objectives
4.40     The IPAM's objective was to train managers at all levels in both the
public and the private sectors. The IPAM was also expected to replace the
existing Civil Service Training College.



- 20 -
Implementation
4.41     Courses.  The Institute began operations in 1980 in the project-
financed facilities. By 1982-83, the Institute was running 10 full-time
courses with about 200 participants, and conducted 15 conferences with about
1,000 participants. The 1983-84 program was planned to include 12 full-tirce
courses and four day-release courses for about 300-350 participants which
would mean full use of the facilities provided under the project.  The private
sector was enthusiastic from the start, and paid for the tuition of the
participants it sent. The Civil Service, however, criticized IPAM as being
too "academic," though it is evident from the 1983-84 curriculum that IPAM has
tried to offer non-academic courses. Examples are those courses it offered
for school administrators and accountants.
4.42     Staff. The full-time staff consisted of the IPAM Director and four
lecturers. CIDA supplied technical assistance through Seneca College, and the
UK did the same through Middlesex Polytechnic. There are plans to increase
the full-time staff to nine, including the Director and two Assistant
Directors.
4.43     Management. IPAM was meant to be managed by a Board with
representatives from the University, the Civil Service, and employers.
Forming the Board has been difficult and time-consuming. A number of ad hoc
committees, therefore, are now giving advice to the Director. He, in turn,
reports to the University Senate. At completion, the Board was expected to be
established soon; a decision had already been made to integrate the Civil
Service College with IPAM and to transfer some of the college's staff.
Conclusions
4.44     IPAM has been extremely successful in its choice of two successive
directors. These directors have succeeded in building an organization which
is already known for efficiency, a competent staff and well-designed courses
with programs formulated in cooperation with future employers. It is evident
that implementation of this component has been successful, and that IPAM is
responding to training needs for management and others in Sierra Leone's
public and private sectors.
G. Educational Planning and Management
Objectives
4.45     The project supported the Government's effort to develop policies and
plans for the educational system and translate them into concrete programs by
strengthening planning at the University of Sierra Leone and in the Ministry
of Education.
University of Sierra Leone
4.46     Many of the University staff first greeted the University's planning
activities with suspicion. This suspicion, and difficulties in finding
suitable technical assistance personnel, delayed the start of the
strengthening exercise.   Eventually, the need to plan for demands on himian



- 21 -
resources and on educational facilities was accepted because of the country's
bleak financial outlook.
4.47     The initial University planning exercise was conducted by foreign
technical assistance experts between 1976 and 1980. During that time, three
staff members from the University Planning Unit were trained in Sierra
Leone. One of them was also trained abroad. The UPU continued its work after
the departure of the experts, but at the time of the completion mission's
visit only one trained local staff member was employed, and the secretarial
support was inadequate. Two trained staff members had left to take other
Government positions and one replacement was being recruited.
4.48     Despite the problems met during implementation-especially in terms
of staffing-a draft plan for the University in the 1980s has been
developed. The Plan has been approved, in principle, by the University
Council, and is now being considered by a special committee before
presentation to the University Senate. The Plan advocates a single University
administration and consolidation of activities, but there are those who wish
to continue with autonomous, decentralized universities. It is likely that
discussion of this issue will continue for some time.
4.49     Even if the UPU is understaffed, and therefore not fully efficient,
and even if the planning issue is not yet resolved, it appears that this
component has helped the Government create a healthy climate for discussion,
and a rational approach to the planning of human resources and the financing
of third-level education and training.
The Ministry of Education Planning Unit
4.50     The project financed fellowships and physical facilities for training
staff for the Planning Unit in the Ministry of Education (MDEPU). The
buildings were occupied in 1979. Only one out of four manyears of fellowship
training was used. The only trained fellow (a graduate of the IIEP in Paris)
is now the MOEPU head.
4.51     The MOEPU was planned to have a staff of 19, including support staff,
headed by a Deputy Chief Education Officer (DCEO). The unit would also have
two Senior Education Officers and three Planning Officers according to the
Credit Agreement. The DCEO post was established and filled for a short period
of time. When the then-recently appointed DCEO retired in 1977, no successor
was appointed since no one with the right planning qualifications and enough
seniority was available. There may also have been some reluctance to have two
parallel DCEO posts in the Ministry after the earlier experience with this
arrangement described in para. 2.22. A Senior Education Officer has been head
of the MOEPU since the DCEO left. The other five posts agreed to in the
Credit Agreement have not been filled, and the work is being done by staff at
lower levels. The mission was unable to obtain a clear statement why a DCEO
replacement had not beer hired, despite the Government's commitment. Perhaps
the Ministry of Education has not been able to find a well-qualified planner
with enough seniority and experience. In the absence of this expected senior
leadership, the MOEPU's morale has been weakened and the search for better
qualified staff hampered. The lack of an appointment may also be related to
the erosion of civil service salaries and the difficulty of recruiting and
retaining high-level staff in the civil service. The fellowship program was



- 22 -
not fully completed (para. 4.50). This is largely because there was
inadequate funding for the trainee attacbment post (Section 3.06 of the Credit
Agreement).
4.52     There were not enough frequently used supplies and other resources
available to enable the Unit to function effectively. Some funds for such
things as transport, subsistence, and office supplies were allocated to the
Unit from crdit proceeds toward the end of implementation in order to help the
Unit prepare the Third Education Project.
4.53     The MOEPU did not devote itself to overall and long-term planning of
the school system to the extent expected at appraisal, but concentrated mainrly
on short-term efforts. Thus, it prepared outlines for education projects
suitable for foreign aid. The HOEPU also did evaluations, including a tracer
study of students in trade schools. But the tracer study on secondary school
graduates planned at appraisal was not done. A Peace Corps volunteer helped
set up a data collection system, but, after her departure in 1980, the system
was discontinued.
4.54     The unit's work was enhanced toward the end of implementation when an
expatriate educational planning specialist financed under the EEC Technical
Assistance Project (EEC Cr. 52-SL) was seconded to it. The specialist advised
the MOEPU staff on project planning, research, collecting data, and
formulating plans. He also organized staff training. This post is being
continued under the Third Education Project.
Conclusions
4.55     The MOEPU did not have the impact on educational policy and planning
that was expected at appraisal. This was partly due to the fact that the
Government did not succeed in meeting the agreed targets for staffing (para.
4.51) and staff training, (para 4.50) and did not allocate sufficient
recurrent funds for the Unit's efficient operation. Since sound educational
policy and development depend greatly on efficient planning, and since the
MOEPU's activities improved substantially during the last years of
implementation, with the help of technical assistance, the Third Education
Project includes continued support to the Unit's development by providing
specialist services, fellowships for training of local staff, and operating
costs (for office supplies, transport, and travel allowances).

V. IDA'S PERFORMANCE
5.01     The project was supervised in the field by 18 missions for a total of
42.5 staffweeks. Economists made 13 supervision visits and architects made 11
visits. General education specialists made six visits, most of them towards
the end of implementation. No management special-Ist visited IPAM, and no
rural development specialist visited the NTC, to conduct supervision.
Nevertheless, the two institutions were successfully completed. Technical
educators made two supervision visits to the trade schools.  This coaponent
might have benefited from more frequent visits by Bank staff members.  The
supervision by architects was conducted efficiently and the number of visits
was adequate.
5.02     Project implementation benefitted considerably from the close
collaboration between IDA and the Government. Supervision missions focussed
continuously on helping the Government find solutions to implementation
problems which arose. Throughout implementation, the Government remained
committed to the project's principal objectives, and made a serious effort to
implement the project as agreed. However, the country's rapidly deteriorating
economy and the resulting severe constraints on the Government necessitated
changes. IDA responded with considerable flexibility to the Government's
proposals to make greater use of local consultants, by agreeing to use funds
originally allocated for expatriate specialist services to financing operating
costs (travel, subsistence and supplies) and honoraria for local specialists
and the local costs of expatriate specialists. The cooperation between IDA
and the Government in respect of the education sector survey, and the
preparation of the Third Project with funds available from savings under the
Second Project was very positive, and resulted in a project based on sector
work and pre-investment studies carried out largely by local specialists.
5.03     Between 1976 and 1980, the project was supervised almost completely
by economists and architects because of divisional staffing constraints. This
could be why supervision of some of the educational aspects of the project
(including secondary school curriculum development and the start up of the
IRCs' educational activities) may not have been supervised as substantively as
desired, and why some software issues referred to in Chapter IV surfaced only
later in the project.

VI. OBSERVATIONS, RECOMMENDATIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED BY IDA
General Assessment
6.01     The Credit was formally closed at the end of December, 1982, 27
months behind the closing date foreseen at appraisal. All project
institutions were completed when the completion mission visited Sierra Leone
in October 1983. The project's hardware objectives for civil works,
furniture, and equipment were met. The institution building and educational
objectives were partly met.
Lessons Learned
6.02     Design of the Project.  As was usual at the time, the project was
designed with multiple objectives and a large number of components. Our
experience implementing this project confirms the difficulties inherent in
this approach, and the delay in project completion was protably the inevitable
result. Had the project not benefitted from the leadership of an unusually
experienced project director supported by a well-qualified and motivated
staff, the difficulties and delays wo-ld undoubtly have been more serious.
These lessons were taken into account in the design of the Third Education
Project, which has been designed to have two main objectives. (These are the
expansion and the quality improvement of primary education. The project is
also limited to one level of education, with supporting services.)
6.03     Institutional Development.  Experience with this project illustrates
the difficulty in strengthening national institutions during a period of
economic decline.   The Government's difficulties in recruiting senior staff
for the Research Division in the IOE and the planning units are telling in
this respect (paras. 4.36, 4.47 and 4.51). On the other biand, the results of
using local consultants and relying on local taskforces for carrying out the
bulk of the studies supported by the project was extremely good
(para. 4.38). It indicates that when a determined effort is made to find
local consultants and to provide the necessary operational support through
local cost financing, good results can be obtained. The NTC, MMTC, and IPAM
are well-run institutions. This shows that with qualified and motivated
leadership, institutions can operate effectively even under difficult external
circumstances. It also underscores the importance of selecting good managers
for project institutions.
6.04     Pilot Primary Schools. Funds for preparation of a Third Education
Project were included in the Second Project. Some of these funds were used
for building and equipping six pilot primary schools (paras. 2.09 and 2.15) in
order to help establish designs and to determine cost and working methods as a
preparation for the primary school component under the Third Education
Project. There were some difficulties in implementation because of the lack
of an adequate revolving fund. It has become clear that the availability of
such a revolving fund is essential for the smooth implementation of a primary
school construction program in rural areas with small local contractors. The
Third Project includes a substantial revolving fund. The design and
implementation of the pilot project and the subsequent evaluation helped the
Third Project to a fast and efficient take-off. This is an aspect of project
design which should be repeated in similar projects.



- 25 -
6.05     Production Units. The establishment of self-supporting production
units at trade schools for production and sales of furniture and other
articles was difficult.  The production units were not operating at the time
of the completion mission despite the availability of workshops and equipment,
and because of a lack of funds to buy raw materials, transport, marketing and
information to prospective customers, etc. Before similar project items are
considered in future projects, a careful analysis of the market and of the
opportunities for the use of private manufacturers should be undertaken (para.
4.19).
6.06     Educational Management.  The project created Instructional Resource
Centers (IRCs) for in-service training of teachers at each of four Primary
Teachers Colleges outside of Freetown. The IRCs were located on the campuses
of the colleges, but were placed under the leadership of the Director of the
Institute of Education (IOBE).  The dual leadership of the IRCs caused
confusion and delay in the use of the IRCs.  Earlier, supervision missions
proposed to the Ministry of Education that the IRCs should be under the formal
jurisdiction of the principals of the colleges, but with the IOE Directors
retaining the right to conduct in-service training courses in the IRCs for
teachers in the college areas. This arrangement seemed to be in operation at
the time of completion, although it was not formally established. Future
appraisal missions should avoid this kind of complex administrative
arrangement (para. 4.30) and instead promote simplicity in project design.

PROJECT CGAPLETION REPORT
SIERRA LEONE - SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(CREDIT 573/EEC CREDIT 52-SL)
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Milton Nargai Teachers College (MMTC)
1.      'Exerts.  The project provided for five expert posts of three years
each, for a total of 15 manyears. Three of the expert posts would be in
technical subjects (a project manager/specialist in technical teacher
training, a specialist in woodwork, and a specialist in metal work) and two
posts would be in business education (an expert in commerce and economics, and
an expert in technical/vocational curriculum development for secondary
schools). The recruitment of the project manager posed great problems. Only
after a two-year delay did the sixth candidate proposed accept the post. He
began work in 1978. The experts in woodwork and metal work and the expert in
commerce had by that time been in their posts for a year. The post of
technical/vocational curriculum development expert, which was expected to be
filled by a foreign expert, was filled with a Sierra Leonean in 1978. He had
been trained under a British Overseas Development Agency (ODA) fellowship and
did well. The savings made under the curriculum development post were used
for extension of the expert assignments in woodwork and metal work so these
assignments could finish at the same time as that of the project manager.
Counterparts for the project manager and the experts in woodwork and metalwork
were appointed in 1979.
2.       The expert program started slowly because of the delay in the
appointment of the project manager. However, after some initial difficulties,
the MMTC prirzcipal, the team of experts, and their counterparts cooperated
well and did an outstanding job at designing courses and developing syllabi
for the MMTC technical teacher training program.
3.       Fellowships.  The project provided 10 manyears of fellowships for
training of five MMTC teachers (three in technical subjects and two in
business education). ODA took over the fellowship training program and added
another three manyears of fellowships for a total of 13 manyears. The
addition of three manyears allowed funding of another five fellowships (two in
technical studies, two in secretarial studies and one in business
education). All except two fellows returned to the MMTC for teaching. One of
the two fellows (a business teacher) was not appointed because of a "staff
freeze" in hiring, and the other fellow (a teacher in woodwork) failed to
return to Sierra Leone after completion of the course. The fellowship
training programs were relevant and effective for work of the MMTC.
The Social Welfare National Training Center (NTC)
4.       Experts.  The project provided for 7.5 manyears of expert services to
expand and diversify the program at the existing Ministry of Social Welfare
National Training Center. The effort was to be carried out in four phases: a
survey and analysis of skill requirements, program development, pilot project
experimentation, and evaluation.

5.       The component was successfully carried out as planned by four local
experts between 1977-79. The local experts were aided by short-term foreign
consultants in education planning, curriculum development, study design and
teaching materials development who were recruited through the British Council,
with IDA financing. The Sierra Leonean experts were a national director of
the study, and experts in social development planning, curriculum development
and training, and a sociologist. The program development was successfully
carried through and later applied in the regular NTC course program.
6.       Fellowships.  The project provided for two manyears of fellowships
which were used for short study tours abroad by the local experts. These
tours to England and to African countries were valuable for the program
development effort.
Institute of Education (IOE)
7.       Experts.  The project provided for 11-1/2 manyears of expert services
(a curriculum coordinator, subject specialists in English, mathematics, and
social studies to revise secondary school curricula, and an expert in primary
teacher training). IDA, in 1978, approved a 15-month extension of all posts
except for the primary teacher training expert. This post was never filled
because the Government failed to identify a candidate. All expert posts were
held by Sierra Leoneans.
8.       The work of the coordinator and the subject specialists was
undertaken without a stated Government policy framework on diversification of
curricula (para. 4.03), and the coordination of the views of the subject
panels was too poor to efficiently promote the diversification efforts (naras.
4.31). The work of the coordinator, therefore, and of the subject experts did
not help much to introduce more diversified curricula in the secondary schools
(para. 4.32).
9.       Study and fellowship.  The project provided for half a manyear of
expert services for specialists in "educational books and materials and school
broadcasting". The Government conducted a study on developing, producing, and
distributing textbooks and teachers' manuals for the primary education
system. This study formed the basis for an ODA-financed textbook component
under the Third Education Project. School broadcasting was not dealt with in
the study, although radio will be used for in-service training of primary
school teachers and to give the public information when the books are to be
introduced in the schools. The two-year fellowship for educational publishing
was not used. However, training in editing and book publishing are part of
the Third Education Project, and two editors and the director of the textbook
component have already been trained under ODA fellowships in England.
Institute of Public Administration (IPAM)
10.      Experts.  IDA provided for 12 manyears of expert services (a director
of IPAM, a public administration specialist, a small industry management
specialist, and short-term specialist services). The post of director was



- 38 -
ANNEX 8
Page 3 of 4
held in turn by two well-qualified persons. This helped the Institute to a
successful start. The public administration post was held successively by
three well-qualified persons, one of whom still holds the post which is now
funded under the British Expatriate Supplementary Scheme (ODA). The post of
small industry specialist was held by an expert who thereafter served for two
years as the first director of the IPAM. Three manyears of expert services
were not used, since three short-term visiting experts were funded by the
Inter-University Council of London.
11.      Fellowships.  The project provided six manmonths of fellowships for
short-term study tours. The project also funded a fellowship in Industrial
Relations for one academic year. In addition, the Inter-University Council of
London funded a fellowship for training a technician at IPAM (nine months),
and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) funded two
fellowships, one in business accounting (three years) and one in public
administration (three years). All fellowships were carried through, but the
fellow in business accounting was not appointed to a post at the Institute
upon his return. The fellow in industrial relations did not return to IPAM or
to Sierra Leone after completion of his studies, but has expressed his
willingness to refund the cost of his fellowship to the University of Sierra
Leone.
12.      The expert program was successfully implemented and helped IPAM to a
successful start. The fellowships program was also well-handled despite the
fact that only two of the four fellows returned to IPAM.
University of Sierra Leone: Planning and Management
13.      Experts.  The project provided three manyears of expert services for
two posts, a university planner for two years and a specialist in university
financial administration for one year for strengthening the university's
planning capacity. A university planner made three visits to Sierra Leone to
plan the work of the unit and the experts. The post of university planner was
thereafter held by two other experts, by one expert for four months and later
by another expert for eleven months. The post of financial administrator was
held by one expert for three months. Although no fellowships were included in
the project, IDA agreed to finance training abroad for a national counterpart
planner. Two more persons were trained locally by the experts. Despite
staffing problems during implementation, the work of the experts and, later,
the local staff, resulted in a draft university plan (para. 4.48).
Ministry of Education Planning Unit
14.      Fellowships.  The project provided for four manyears of fellowships
for six persons in order to strengthen the planning capacity of the unit.
Four persons were expected to participate in courses of about nine months in
education planning and statistics, and one person was expected to take part in
a three-month training course in school plant design and planning. Another
person was supposed to make study visits to planning units in other

countries. Those trained under the project would be required to serve for at
least two years in the positions for which they were trained.
15.      This training program was substantially not implemented.  Only one
person-the present head of the Planning Unit-went through training. He
participated in a nine-month course in educational planning at the Institute
of Educational Planning in Paris. The other five fellowships were not used in
spite of continuous reminders by IDA supervision missions to the Government
about its commitment to hire and train staff for the unit. It appears as if
the Government never felt entirely committed to supply the unit with new staff
positions, and without these there was no oue to train.  Another explanation
given was that nobody was willing to promise to serve the unit for two years
after receiving fellowship training.
16.      A new and forceful effort to strengthen the Planning Unit is being
carried out under the IDA's Third Education Project, based on the experience
gained by the Government and IDA with its support to the Planning Unit through
the Technical Assistance Project (Credit no. 970-SL). The Unit, under the
Third Project, will receive technical assistance, staff training, transport
equipment, and recurrent cost financing.

Dear Kr. '.atanabe,
RE PROJECT vOI-ILETIOli REPORT - SIERRA IEO1-E
EDUCATIOAi  PROJECT  (Cr.573, EEC CR.53 - SL
Thank you very much for inviting my comments on the draft
evaluation report on the Second Education Project, which
I dare say, provides a very good insight not only into the
Project content but also into the educational system as a
whole.
On the evaluation itself, I would like to make a few obsorw-
ations. The first concerns the non-fulfilment of some of
the educational objectives such as those partaining zo the
Institute of Education and the Planning Unit of the Ministry
of Education, This fact came out so clearly in the report
bult what is equally unclear is the reason(s) for the lapses.
I know very little about the Ministry or Institute of
Education, not having worked in that sector before.  However,
in my limited experience with project administration in
Sierra Leone, particularly with the education sector, I
believe that institutional factors determine to a large
measure the success of its programmes.  Here I am referring
specifically to the deployment and indeed the capability of
the persornnel who im.lemaent these Drogrammes. I also realise
that the Wiorld Brak would not make direct reference to the
methods of deployment or individual canabilities of local
personnel, but Derhaps this may be the only way to get the
authorities to better appreciate the short-comings of the
system. I strongly believe thint some of the educational
objectives were not fulfilled because of personnel problems;
your paragraph 4.55 refers.
The report advocates the need for flexibility in the imple-
entation of Bank projects to the extent that arrangements
for implementation could even be redesigned should problems
be encountered alon_ the way. This is very encouraging.
Very often project managers cet into intractable implement-
ation probleris arisinp from various factors such as a wrong
assu:mition or a mere over-sight durinr- aonraisal.  Solution
cf such problems could take a long time involving sometimes
annecessary delays and cost-overruns,

The report states that the university budget depends largely
on Government Grants; if this is not an understatement, what
are the other sources of the university's finances?
Paragraph 2.14 outlines the causes for the delays in the
construction component.  What is left out is, to most observ-
ers, the most obnoxious of the causes, namely: the tendering
processes. Here again, the Bank may not wish to be unequiv-
ocally critical on the institutional arrangents of member
countries but as an official I am fully convinced that if
the tendering procedures are stream-lined (possibly by sett-
ing firm deadlines and the physical participation of Bank
staff during tender processing) then delays of all sorts
could be reduced to the minimum.
One final observation concerns the due emphasis put on
counterpart funding. M1ost times, delays in implementation
are attributed to the- lack of counterpart funds from the
domestic budget.  This is true.  But wrhat is also true is
the inefficient utilization of these funds even where they
are available. Personally I have had cause to refuse to
countersign cheques or applications for disbursement due to
a variety of factors.  What I am pointing out is that although
counterpart funds are sometimes not provided in good time,
in the majority of cases their administration rather than
availability, is the greatest cause for concern.
I look forward to another opportunity to discuss such draft
evaluation reports in the future.
Yours sincerely,
J. Sanpha Koroma
Deputy Financial Secretary
