                                             I.THEPROPOSAL

1.       The Bangladeshi economy i s reeling under the impact o f three adverse external shocks occuning
in quick succession during the last several months. These shocks could derail the good economic
progress Bangladesh was malung in recent years. The first shock has been the unabated increase in
international prices o f oil and food o fwhich Bangladesh i s a net importer. The second shock came inthe
form o f severe floods during July-September 2007, which killed over a thousand people and wrecked
havoc on the economy. The third and the most recent shock was the devastating cyclone that struck the
country on November 15,2007, causing significant loss o f life and inflictingenormous social, human and
economic costs.

2.       Faced with this unusual and unanticipated situation, the Government o f Bangladesh (GOB)has
appealed for urgent international support to cope with the unremittingstrain on the economy and the
immediate relief needs o f nearly nine million cyclone victims. Responding to that call, the second
Supplemental Financing (SF2) to the Fourth Development Support Credit (DSC IV)i s being proposed for
two reasons. First, to provide GOBwith the fiscal space to undertake emergency spending without
foregoing planned critical development expenditures. Second, to enable GOBto remain on track in
implementing its policy and institutional reform agenda agreed under the framework o f DSC IV. SF2
will also help protect the flood rehabilitation expenditures supported by the first Supplemental Financing
(SF1) to DSC IV (for an amount o f US$ 75 million), which was delivered to GOBin October 2007 in
response to the devastating floods in July-September, 2007. Emergency spending would be critical to
address short-term needs o f those affected by the cyclone-through          programs such as cash or food
assistance to households, grants and loans to help rebuild damaged homesteads and replace lost assets,
assistance to farmers on agncultural inputs, and rehabilitation o f damaged infrastructure.

3.       The proposed credit will help GOBcontinue along the path o f reforms needed to accelerate
economic growth and poverty reduction.          The Bank has supported the government's policy and
institutional reform program through a series o f multi-sectoral budget-support operations-Development
Support Credits (DSCs).' These credits have assisted Bangladesh's reform efforts to (a) strengthen core
governance functions, with emphasis on reforms in public procurement, budget formulation and
execution, tax administration and public administration; and (b) improve the investment climate by
maintaining macroeconomic stability, deepening domestic deregulation and trade liberalization, and
strengthening the performances o f the banlung and energy sectors and state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
To help sustain the momentum of the reform program, the Bank i s working with the current Caretaker
Government (CTG) on a wide range of policy and institutional reforms that can be supported by a
Transitional Support Credit (TSC) as part o f its FY08 assistance program.'            While the government

'
    A total of US$900million has been provided to GOBinthe form o f four budget-support operations. The first
    DSC was processed in 2003 and the last-a   US$200 million IDA credit-was     approved by the Board in M a y
    2007.
2   The World Bank Group's most recent Country Assistance Strategy, discussed by the Board in April 2006,
    aligns with the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy.   It envisaged a series o f Poverty Reduction Support
    Credits to be initiated in FY08 following general elections then scheduled for early 2007. Because o f the



                                                  1

remains committed to reforms, the repeated natural disasters can disrupt the momentum by creating
pressures on the government budget and worsening the macroeconomic situation-a risk that the proposed
supplemental financing will help mitigate.


                                    11.THENOVEMBER CYCLONE  2007

4.       Just as Bangladesh was beginning to emerge from the aftermath o f the floods, a Category-Four
tropical cyclone (named Si&) struck its southern coastline on November 15, 2007. With a 74-lalometer
radius and wind speeds reaching 223 km/hour, it killed nearly 4,000 people (with an additional 900 still
reported missing) and affected the lives o f about 8.7 million people in 30 out o f the 64 districts in the
country. Had it not been for the country's Cyclone Preparedness Program (CPP)-that              allowed four days
o f advance warnings at regular intervals, with messages delivered from house to house by 40,000 CPP
volunteers-the    death toll would have been much higher. The economic losses were extensive, including
destruction or damage to standing Aman rice crops, fisheries (particularly shrimp farms), forestry,
livestock, housing, rural roads, embankments, and power distribution and transmission network. The
beauty and biodiversity o f the Sunderbans, a World Natural Heritage site, has also been significantly
damaged.

5.       Bangladesh i s among the countries most vulnerable to natural disasters, which include recurrent
floods, droughts, and cyclones. Its southern part i s nestled in the Bay o f Bengal with a 710 km long
coastal belt and an area o f about 37,000 sq. km. The coastal zone includes coastal plain islands, tidal flats
and offshore waters, and i s crisscrossed by a vast river network, a dynamic estuarine system, and a
drainage basin. The coastal area i s roughly 32 percent o f the country's geographical area and home to
nearly 35 millionpeople (24 percent o f the total population). Poverty i s significantly higher inthe coastal
zone than inthe rest o f the country. Barisal and Khulna divisions, which account for most o f the coastal
area, have poverty rates o f 52 and 46 percent respectively, compared with 40 percent for the country as a
whole.

    changed political situation and the new election schedule, it has been decided that the Bank would support the
    country's ongoing reforms during the transition period through a one-off budget support in the form o f a
    Transitional Support Credit.

6.      Many o f the worst or badly affected districts were characterizedby highconsumptionpoverty and
lagging social indicators in comparison with the rest o f the country even before the cyclone. All four
worst-affected districts (where more than 75 percent o f the population has been affectedkBorguna,
Bagerhat, Patuakhali and Pirojpur-are        in the poorest divisions of Barisal and Khulna (see Table 1
above); infact, all districts inBarisal division are inthe "worst" or "badly" affected category. The socio-
economic characteristics o f the four worst-affected districts indicate highlevels o f deprivation prior to the
cyclone. Per capita consumption o f households in these four districts is almost 15 percent below the
national average; 25 percent of households have electricity connections compared to the national average
o f 44 percent; 11 percent live in houses with straw roof compared to 8 percent nationally (Household
Income and Expenditure Survey/HlES, 2005); and 53 percent have access to tap or tubewell dnnking
water compared to 83 percent nationally (Census 2001).

7.       A crisis situation has developed in the cyclone-affected areas, which necessitates massive relief
work and post-cyclone rehabilitation. Ponds and other sources o f dnnkmg water have become polluted,
exposing area residents to the threat o f disease. The Government, in partnership with development
partners and NGOs, i s puttinginplace a robust rescue, relief, and rehabilitation effort. As the immediate
needs are met, the focus o f the government and development partners would shift towards a longer term
strategy that facilitates economic recovery in the affected areas and improves systems to build resilience
in the country to mitigate the impact of such shocks in the future. GOBhas a comprehensive disaster
management strategy which could be further refined on the basis o f lessons learnt.3 Complementing the
ongoing efforts o f the government, a Damage and Needs Assessment (DNA) i s being prepared by the
World Bank in partnership with other development partners, which will provide more information on
improving existing disaster preventionand management systems.

8.       The proposed SF2 credit will help GOBmeet the immediate short-term needs by reducing the
fiscal pressure on the FY08 budget arising from unforeseen cyclone-related spending, including the need
to provide large amounts o f cash and food aid (including rice) to address the consumption needs o f the
affected population. GOBhas already redirected some o f its budgetary resources for cyclone rescue and
relief.  Concessionary financing from development partners in support o f the additional resource
requirement would be critical inthis hour o fneed. The recent political and economic developments inthe
country, summarized inthe next section, provide the context for the proposed operation.


                                        111. RECENT     DEVELOPMENTS

9.       Political developments. A protracted period o f political unrest late last year caused the
parliamentary elections to be postponed in January. The current CTG took office on January 11, 2007
after a state o f emergency was declared.          The CTG-a       nonpartisan government established under
Bangladesh's Constitution to assist and oversee the conduct o f free, fair, and credible elections-has
pursuedthis central mandate with vigor, engaging ina broad agenda o f institutionalreforms. The CTG i s
being assisted by the country's defense forces in maintaining law and order and preparing for elections.
At the centre of its institutional reform agenda is a robust anticorruption effort, which has strong public
support. On July 15, 2007, the Election Commission (EC) released an electoral roadmap, with the next
parliamentary election scheduled for the end o f 2008. The timetable for the parliamentary elections
remains on schedule. The preparation o f a digtized voter list i s proceeding well. Since September, the
EC has been engaging in a dialogue with the 15 main political parties about reforms to the electoral laws,
a process now almost complete.


    A strategy on disaster management was put together by GOBin2003, which laid out a Comprehensive Disaster
    Management Program. The response to the 2007 flood emergency and to the November cyclone (particularly
    the significant reduction inloss of human lives as compared to previous disasters) reflects these improvements.

10.      While progress on the electoral roadmap i s on track, there remains some uncertainty about the
future political landscape. Intra-party political reforms have stagnated. The two leaders of the main
political parties, the BNP and Awami League, remain highly influential over their respective parties
despite being in custody on corruption-related charges. The CTG also has many powerful detractors,
including those who have lost due to the anti-corruption drive. High and rising food prices remain a
central public concern.

11.      Economic Developments.           Despite several development constraining factors-low       natural
resource and s h l l base, highpopulation density, severe vulnerability to floods and cyclones-Bangladesh
has continued its steady economic and social progress. The poverty rate declined by an average o f nearly
2 percentage points annually, from 49 percent o f the population in2000 to 40 percent in2005, mainly on
the back o f strong and stable economic growth. Annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has
accelerated by 1 percentage point every decade, averagmg over 6 percent a year during FY2003-07.
Progresstoward several other MDGs, as elaborated inparagraph 46 below, has also been impressive.

12.      The economy grew by 6.6 percent in FY06, the highest rate in over two decades, and, despite
prolonged political turmoil, by 6.2 percent in FY07. This was the fourth consecutive year of at least 6
percent growth (see Table 2 below). Growth has been broad-based, shared across all major economic
sectors and benefiting from robust demand in both domestic and export markets. The manufacturing
sector grew at an impressive 11.4percent inFY07, its strongest performance in over a decade. Garment
exports, which account for about 75 percent o f manufacturing exports, grew by 11.6percent (innominal
dollar terms) in FY07 despite enhanced competition from other low-cost producers after the dismantling
o f the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) on January 1, 2005. Construction, fueled by strong
manufacturinggrowth as well as large remittance inflows, grew by an estimated 7.1 percent, maintaining
its 7-8 percent growth record since FY94. Remittances through formal channels were recorded at nearly
US$ 6 billion, which i s about 9 percent o f GDP and half o f gross merchandize exports, compared with
US$ 1.9billion inFYO1.

13.      Macroeconomic stability has been broadly maintained.             The fiscal, monetary, and external
indicators remained mostly within the thresholds o f the macroeconomic framework agreed with the IMF
under the Poverty ReductionGrant Facility (PRGF) programthat ended inJune 2007. However, there are
now emerging stresses. An area o f increasing concern i s inflation. Year-on-year consumer price index
inflation reached a nine-year higho f 10 percent inAugust-October, 2007. A large part of the inflation i s
due to rising food prices, aggravated by the floods and the cyclone. Non-food inflation has also been
rising, though ithas been somewhat contained since July. By providing cash foreign exchange resources,
this operationwill augmentthe government's ability to ameliorate food shortages (by importing food) and
thus contain food price increases.

14.      After persistently falling short o f targets for several years, revenue mobilization seems to have
turned a comer this year with NBR tax revenues growing at 22.5 percent, with income tax collection up
44.7 percent and customs revenue up 19 percent for July-November 2007-all                   considerably above
targets. Non-NBR tax revenue and non-tax revenue have also done well, growing by about 20 percent
and 38 percent respectively inJuly-August 2007 relative to the corresponding period o f the previous year.
As elaborated later in the document, the budget is under considerable stress because o f a sequence of
external shocks. In response to the various additional spending pressures, the government i s planning
austerity measures, by delaying implementation o f low-priority Annual Development Program (ADP)
projects.

15.      A summer of floods. Devastating floods struck Bangladesh inthe months o f July/August and
again in September 2007. The floods directly affected over 13 million people in46 districts, caused over
1,000 deaths, and damaged over 2 million acres o f agncultural land, infrastructure, social and educational
facilities, and private assets, including housing, crops, livestock, and fisheries. The estimated economic
impact of the floods was about US$ 1.1billi~n.~

16.      The CTG's flood response efforts placed severe pressure on its FY08 budget. The Tk 8 billion
(0.2 percent o f GDP) originally budgeted for natural disaster response proved much smaller than the fiscal
impact o f the floods. This put at risk the development spending priorities and overall macroeconomic
stability. To help cope with the situation, the Bank provided a US$ 75 million Supplemental Financingto
DSC IV. Subsequently, a US$ 122.2 million Flood Restoration and Recovery Assistance Program have
been prepared (with a Board date on January 10, 2008). Barely one month after the disbursement o f SFI,
nature struck again in the form o f Sidr. The full impact o f the cyclone will be h o w n after the ongoing
needs assessment for restoration and rehabilitation i s completed. Meanwhile, additional budget spending
inFY08 to meet the more immediate basic needs o fcyclonevictims has beenestimatedbythe Ministry o f
Finance to be around US$377 million (see paragraph 35 below for details).

17.      Preliminary estimates o f the damages from Sidr indicate that loss o f life has been markedly less
than that from the last two major cyclones (see Table 3).            Human suffering-including        damage to
livestock, housing and crops-is     nevertheless immense and o f a scale similar to that from earlier cyclones
(Table 3). Millions o f people lay trapped in isolated offshore islands and coastal belts, without access to
food, shelter and drinkmgwater, and amidst decomposing bodies and ruined infrastructure. Immediately
after the cyclone, government officials, NGOs, social workers, and political parties had limited success in


    Estimates include output loss from agriculture, livestock and fisheries sectors. Output losses for transport,
    industry and wholesale and retail trade were not estimated due to lack of data. These losses were estimated at
     about 20% o f total loss during 2004 floods. By that measure, total losses during 2007 floods could be about
    US$I.4 billion. Source: World Bank, 2007 Flood Restoration and Recovery Assistance Program, December,

18.      All the statistics on damage and losses reportedhere are preliminary, basedon estimates available
so far from the government, which can change over time as more information emerges from the ground.
More accurate estimates o f the social and human costs from the cyclone, as well as the medium-term
impact on macroeconomic indicators, livelihoods and poverty will become available once the
aforementioned DNA i s completed.'        The paragraphs below summarize the available information on
social and human costs from Sidr; the next section does the same for the economic costs.

    Livelihoods. Fisheries, agnculture, livestock, poultry, collection o f forest products, small businesses
    and trades, micro-enterprises, and wage labor are the major livelihood activities in the coastal areas.
    Income generation has been severely affected in all these sectors, but especially for fishing
    communities, farmers, traders, and small enterprises.       Several hundred thousand individuals have
    been displaced andjust as many have lost their jobs or businesses. Rickshaw pullers, market traders
    and day laborers engaged in seasonal employment and other intermittent activities for subsistence
    have also visibly suffered.

    Health. Many healthcare centers have been seriously damaged. Hunger and disease have become the
    order o f the day inthe affected areas. Unsafe water and unsanitary conditions created by the cyclone
    have vastly increased the risk o f disease (diarrhea, slun diseases, eye infection in particular)
    outbreaks. Malnutrition i s affecting infants, young children, and pregnant and lactating women. An
    estimated 52,810 people have been injured and are in need o f medical supplies and treatment.
    Fortunately, most hospitals and clinics were able to preserve vaccines through the use o f generators,
'
    This should build on the existing medium to long-term strategy on disaster management approved by GOBin
    2003. For more information, please see http://www.cdmp.org.bcU

    cold boxes, and other means. The pre-positioning of essential drugs and medicines including water
    purificationtablets greatly aided preparedness and response.

     Water and sanitation. A serious lack o f safe water supply and latrines has emerged. One estimate for
    some o f the worst-affected areas puts the percentage of slab latrines damaged or destroyed as high as
    70 percent.6 Access to communal facilities is limited and most cyclone shelters do not have adequate
    sanitation facilities. Saline water, carcasses, and debris have contaminated drinkingwater sources in
    many communities. Power outages have affected water supplies in areas with piped water. The
    affected population i s vulnerable to outbreaks of diarrhea and other hygiene related diseases.
    Fortunately, it seems that many o f the contaminated wells can become operational with a few days o f
    pumpingand decontamination.

    Housing. Widespread damage to houses has been the most visible asset loss associated with Sidr.
    Preliminary estimates are that nearly 1.5 million houses have been at least partially damaged, with 38
    percent o f those fully destroyed. Inmany upazilas (sub-districts), more than half o f the thatched-roof
    homes, inhabited by the extreme poor, have been completely destroyed.           Many o f the affected
    households have also lost essential household items.         Although community reconstruction and
    reparation have started in some places, such activities are inadequate to meet the needs o f the poor.
     Shelter materials such as corrugated iron sheets, wood, and other construction materials are badly
    needed to help the poor rebuild their houses.

    Education. The cyclone has fully or partially damaged nearly 15,000 educational institutions. The
    damage and loss include physical infrastructure, classroom supplies, and learning materials. Schools
    that remain open are reportedlywitnessing low attendance rates.

    Infrastructure. A number o froads, bridges, culverts and embankments were damaged. These include
     1,741 km o f fully damaged and 5,767 km partially damaged roads, 1,687 fully or partially damaged
    bridge and culverts, and 1,866 kmo f fully and partially damaged embankments.'

    Power. The power supply system was severely hit. The national power grid tripped depriving the
    entire nation o f electricity for almost 24 hours. Combining the urban and rural electricity distribution
    networks, a total o f about 2,740 km o f circuit wires were disconnected, about 37,500 electric poles
    were either broken or tilted, 32 towers including river crossings were disrupted, about 87 distribution
     Sub-stations were shut down and 38,539 meters were broken. The damage to the power sector i s
    estimated at about US$ 17 million. More than 85 percent o f these damages are inthe rural areas. The
    utilities have now restored electricity supply in most areas. Areas where river crossing towers got
    disrupted will take some more time for renovation.


                             V. CYCLONE      IMPACT:ECONOMICDIMENSION

19.      Prior to the 2007 floods and cyclone, the Bangladeshi economy was poised to grow in the range
o f 6.5 to 7 percent in FY08, propelled by a recovery in agriculture after a weak performance last year.
Buoyant garment exports and remittance flows as well as the possibility o f higher aid and private flows
were expected to sustain investment, including in power infrastructure. The year also began with a
comfortable foreign exchange reserve position o f more than US$ 5 billion (equivalent to 3.2 months o f
imports) and this level was sustained even after back-to-back floods in the July-September period.
Amidst this generally positive economic environment, one concern was inflation, which had been
aggravated by rising international prices o f essential food items such as rice, wheat and edible oil. This

section summarizes the movement o f key economic variables and how these may be affected by the
cyclone.

A. Income andwealth

20.      Output losses in agriculture and small trade will directly affect the economy's growth. Indirect
effects on economic growth are expected to arise from the damage caused to infrastructure and stocks o f
raw and intermediate materials, and inundation of agricultural land with saline water. Inthe immediate
aftermath ofthe cyclone, its adverse impact i s likely to occur inthe following sectors:

    Agricultural production. More than 2.4 million acres o f cropland is reportedly damaged, destroying
    almost one-quarter o fthe ready-to-harvest crops. Aman rice bore the brunt o f the damage, with a loss
    o f about 1.3 million tons o f production, which i s roughly 10 percent o f the FY08 production target.
    Media reports suggest extensive damage to Rabi crop as well. Most o f the affected areas have a
    single annual harvest during the period o f November to January, which made the timing o f the
    cyclone particularly harmful. The severe short-term damage to standing crops (particularly rice) by
    the cyclone has necessitated emergency imports o frice. For the medium term, it will be important to
    identify the potential impact o f the cyclone on future rice production in affected and unaffected areas
    alike, given the potential impact o f rice production on livelihoods, incomes and import needs.

    Livestock. The government estimates that nearly 1.8 million livestock (cattle, buffalos, goats and
    poultry) have been killed; the large majority o f which were cattle. For the poor this represents loss o f
    a critical household asset and associated wealth and income.*

    Fisheries. The cyclone washed away most o f the shnmp enclosures, hatcheries, and processing
    plants. December-January i s the main fresh-water shrimp harvesting period. Much o f that production
    has been lost as saline water entered fresh water zones during the cyclone. Total loss to fisheries is
    tentatively estimated at Tk 738 million (close to US$ 11million), or 4.3 percent o f value added inthe
    fisheries sector inFY07.

    Infrastructure. There has been damage to transport and communication networks. Rural roads and
    embankments protecting such roads have suffered some damage. The coastal and inland waterways
    transport infrastructure, including femes and associated landing and loading areas, have also suffered.
    Electricity and telecom infrastructures have been widely disrupted. The damages to the electricity
    network put the ice factories and the fish processing industries out o f operation and added to the
    losses suffered by farmers and fisheries.

21.   Preliminary estimates indicate output losses amountingto nearly US$445 million, or 0.7 percent o f
GDP on account o f Sidr (see Table 4). WealtWasset losses suffered by households and businesses are
estimated at around Tk 44.5 billion (0.9 percent o f GDP) or about US$ 645 million. Crops dominate
output losses, while housing and private timber trees dominate the asset losses.

22.   Likely poverty impact. Natural disasters like cyclones cause immediate impoverishment by
wiping out assets and employment opportunities, and increase longer-term economic vulnerability. The
immense loss o f private assets-housing      stock, durable household goods and livestock-would               have an
immediate and significant impact on the income, consumption and living conditions o f the poor. Some
signs o fthe short-term impact are already emerging inthe Sidr-affected areas. The damages to food stock
and crop production poses a risk o f food shortages and are likely to exacerbate food price inflation,


    Loss o f livestock takes away the most tangible collateral o f the poor, adversely affecting their access to credit.
    Media reports show instances o f Si&-affected families having to resort to high-interest loans (interest rates as
    high as 15 to 20 percent per month) and ultra poor households to commit their labor at greatly reduced wage
    rates.

already at record high levels prior to the cyc10ne.~ The ability to import foodgrain will be critical to
reduce this risk; and reliefprograms that address the immediate needs o f the affected population-such          as
cash grants and food aid-have       a crucialrole inprotectingthe affected populationagainst deprivation.

23.     Inaddition, there is considerable risk oflong-termpoverty impact of such a shock due to anumber
o f different reasons. Severe shocks often compel the vulnerable to cope with immediate needs by selling
remaining productive assets, accumulating high-interest loans, and removing children from school, all o f
which adversely affect their long-term economic potential.                Evidence from the 1991 cyclone shows
borrowing from informal sources protected the consumption o f many poor but also left them highly
indebted. Social protectionprograms like cash grant and food aid can play an important role, by reducing
the need for costly coping strategies among the affected that can lead to long-termpoverty traps. The risk
of long-termpoverty impact is also exacerbated by the very nature o f cyclone damage, which has not only
severely affected the standing crop but may also depress yields from hture crop(s) in the affected areas.
Given these risks, assistance for inputs and asset replacement to farmers will be critical in reducing the
risk o f increased chronic poverty in the cyclone-affected areas. Furthermore, long-term mitigation
strategies that improve the economic resilience o f vulnerable populations (through mechanisms like
insurance, for example) can be beneficial, given that repeated shocks like floods and cyclones can
households ina vicious cycle o f asset loss, indebtedness, loss o f productivity andpoverty.

B. Externalsector

24.      The cyclone will increase the country's import bill and hurt shrimp exports. In addition to
emergency food imports, post cyclone relief and rehabilitation would involve importing construction
materials (corrugated iron sheets, cement, and steel) to repair damaged houses, road links, embankments,
schools, and health and sanitation facilities. Replenishing the 1 million tons o f Aman production loss
alone could cost about US$ 350 million o f additional rice imports.'o Exports o f frozen food, the second
largest export category, are also likely to suffer, with some adverse impact on the balance o f payments
(BOP).

25.      The BOP position prior to the cyclone was reasonably comfortable despite some emerging
stresses. Trade deficit widened to US$ 1.1 billion in July-September 2007, compared with US$ 361
million deficit in July-September, 2006, as merchandize exports declined by 6 percent and import
payments increased by 17.5 percent. Garment exports declined by 7.8 percent inthe first quarter o f FY08

                                                       9

reflecting fewer import orders received during the period o f political instability inNovember-December
2006, and exacerbated by labor unrest inthe RMG sector and unusually warm winter in Europe that hurt
knitwear exports. The widening o f trade deficit was offset by continued strong growth inremittances-
22 percent higher in the first five months o f FY08 relative to the corresponding period o f the previous
year. As a result, the foreign exchange reserves remained above US$5 billion (equivalent to 3.2 months
of imports) through mid-December and the exchange rate stayed relatively stable. The pressure arising
from the emergency import o f food, agricultural inputs, and construction materials are likely to be
cushioned by the expected additionalexternal assistance on account o fthe cyclone and flood and cyclone-
induced increase in remittances."      All inall, the impact of cyclone on BOPis unlikely to be substantial,
particularly ifthe required external assistance on concessional terms materializes.

C.Fiscalimpact

26.      The fiscal impact o f the cyclone i s likely to be sizable. The relief effort, expansion in food-
assisted safety nets, livelihood restoration assistance, repairs to public property, and the impact o f the
cyclone on economic growth are all likely to put pressure on both the revenue and expenditure sides o f
the budget.

27.      The expenditure needs are multi-dimensional.          The original FY08 target for food distribution
through the public food distribution system was 2.2 million tons, which will be revised upward to
accommodate additional flood and cyclone relief needs. The Ministry o f Agriculture (MOA)is preparing
an extensive agricultural rehabilitation program for the Sidr-affected districts, under which seeds and
fertilizers would be distributed free of cost among the Sidr-affected farmers for the upcoming Boro
season. The MOAhas also undertaken an initiative to facilitate large-scale cultivation o f pulses in the
cyclone-hit coastal districts o f Barguna, Bhola, and Patuakhaly, where Boro crop i s not usually grown. In
addition, farmers would need assistance with the health o f their surviving cattle, many o f whom are
suffering from malnutrition, in the form o f essential veterinary medicines and vaccines. Assistance for
procurement o f housing materials, food and other essentials such as drugs and medicines and support for
reviving livelihoods will further add to budgetary expenditures.

28.      Given these needs, revenue (current) expenditure i s likely to overshoot the original FY08 budget
target. The provision for unforeseen expenditures in the FY08 Revenue Budget and the Food Account
has already been significantly exhausted by the floods. There may still be some room for redirecting
expenditures from the ADP toward the repair o f damaged infrastructure. As it is, ADP implementation
has suffered a severe blow due to the floods, with the implementation rate o f only 7.5 percent inthe first
quarter, compared with 10.7 percent inthe first quarter o f FY07.

29.      The FY08 central government budget deficit i s likely to overshoot the original target o f 4.5
percent o f GDP, by a projected 0.9 percentage point, out o f which cyclone-related additional expenditures
account for around 0.5 percentage points.'*          Lack o f pass-through o f international prices o f oil and
fertilizer has created pressure for providing budget support to energy and chemical SOEs. Damage from
floods has already affected the implementation o f the FY08 budget.                Spending on flood relief and


11   US$375 million i s the estimate o f the Bangladesh Bank. Source: Finance Secretary's presentation on Sidr at
     the Local Consultative Group (LCG) meeting on December 12,2007.
     The projected FY08 budget deficit without adding the additional expenditure arising from the three shocks and
     assuming 80 percent utilization of programmed ADP expenditure is 3.5 percent o f GDP. T o ths, the absence of
     pass-through o f increased international prices (oil and fertilizer) adds 1 percentage point (the amount to be
     provided through the central government budget inFY08), flood expenditure another 0.4 percentage points and
     cyclone expenditure 0.5 percentage points, increasing the deficit projection for FY08 to about 5.4 percent o f
     GDP.

rehabilitation amounted to Tk 20.6 billion by mid-November and was financed by reallocation o f h n d s
originally earmarked for operations and maintenance and social safety nets, cuts in non-priority
development projects and external budget support. The challenge o f containing the FYO8 budget deficit
within the post-flood target will be formidable, notwithstanding the 22.5 percent growth in tax revenue
collection by the National Board o f Revenue (NBR) achieved during July-November, 2007, relative to
July-November, 2006. There is an urgent need to tackle the fiscal situation by continuing to strengthen
the nation-wide tax registration h v e , tax administration and enforcement, cutting non-priority
development projects further and mobilizing additional foreign aid.

D.Inflationandmonetaryconditions

30.     Inflation, already on the rise inrecent years, has been exacerbated by the floods and the cyclone.
Inflation reached a nine-year high o f 10 percent (year-on-year) in August-October, 2007, driven mainly
by food inflation, which remained over 11 percent (year-on-year).         Non-food inflation was lower at
around 7.5 percent (year-on-year). Rice, edible oil, and wheat were the major sources o f food inflation in
bothrural and urban areas. Over the longer term, inflation has risen due to international commodity price
increases and domestic monetary accommodation o f these price increases. Also, these price movements
were compounded by short-term domestic supply shocks such as relatively poor crop harvests last year
and the drives against corruption, adulteration and hoarding.         The damage to crops and transport
infrastructure caused by floods and cyclone would also exacerbate inflationary pressures.

31.      Containing inflation would require a cautious monetary policy stance and greater fiscal prudence.
Most urgent policy attention is needed for the large financial losses o f the SOEs, the financing o f which
fuels inflation. Adjustment o f administered prices o f fuel, gas, electricity and fertilizer i s long overdue
and SOEs are countinglosses inbillions o f takas every month as a result. SOE losses inFY08 on account
o f under-pricingo f diesel, urea, power, and gas are projectedat nearly Tk 112 billion (US$1.6 billion).

32.     The banking system has Tk 140 billion in surplus liquidity (equivalent to 3 percent o f GDP),13
reflecting monetary hangover from past surges inmoney supply and dampened demand for money by the
private sector in recent months. After declining from 22.3 percent in December 2006 to 15.7 percent in
August this year, monetary (M2) growth rose to 15.9 percent in September, reflecting sharp increases in
net foreign assets and credit to the public sector, both central government and the SOEs. Growth o f credit
to the private sector declined from 19.4 percent in December 2006 to 15.1 percent in June 2007 before
rising to 15.9 percent in August-September, 2007, as nominal lending rates fell marginally from 12.75
percent in June to 12.57 percent in September. Monetary growth declined to 14.2 percent inOctober due
to decline in growth o f both net foreign assets as well as net domestic assets. However, growth in credit
to private sector increasedto 16.3 percent.


                                     VI. RESPONSETO THE CYCLONE

33.     The Government's response to the cyclone has been swift and robust-both              in mitigating its
effects and coping with its aftermath. Availing o f the disaster preparedness programs in place, the CTG
opened 2,168 cyclone shelters, which accommodated at least 1.5 million people evacuated from the
vulnerable areas of the coastal districts. In the aftermath o f the cyclone, the Government has deployed
members o f the defense forces, boats and helicopters for rescue and relief activities, allocated funds from
the Chief Adviser's Relief and Welfare Fundfor Gratuitous Relief and house building, and provided rice,
medicines, water purification tablets, blankets, tents and corrugated iron sheets to the cyclone victims.
The CTG's cyclone response strategy has three components:



l3   As of October 25,2007


                                                  11

    Immediate, short-run (first month) activities include search and rescue, restoration of emergency
    services, provision o f emergency reliefand treatment facilities, and damage assessments.

    Medium-term (three tofour months). House building assistance; continued food support; reopening
    damaged educational institutions; preventing outburst o f epidemics; sinking tube wells; cleaning
    salinated ponds; repairing roads, culverts and bridges; restoring electricity networks; providing
    mobile electricity generators to supply electricity to local hospitals, drinkmg water pumps, ice
    factories and fish processing zones.

    Long-term (beyond four months). Rehabilitation o f the Sundarbans; reconstruction o f coastal
    embankments, polders and sluice gates; coastal afforestation; improving early warning systems; and
    expansion o f CPP operations.

34.      A preliminary program o f assistance has been preparedby the government, which includes relief
activities, food imports, assistance to farmers for agricultural inputs,reconstruction and repair o f damaged
structures, and infrastructure rehabilitation. The program also includes measures to provide safety net
support to households and revive livelihoods, through cash grants and/or food assistance to maintain
consumption levels as well as soft loans and grants to help replace lost assets.I4 For cyclone relief, the
Government is primarily relying on two pre-existing programs: Gratuitous Relief (GR) and Vulnerable
Group Feeding (VGF), both o f which are implemented through local governments (Union Parishads or
UPS). The Government is also providing funds to Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs) and
Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) to enable them to provide refinancing options for their clients in the
cyclone affected areas. Some significant initiatives o f the preliminary assistance program are listed
below. Table 5 (see below) provides details on expenditure impact o f the program and the sources o f
financing envisaged.

    A new VGFprogram,from December I,in 790 unions of the 12 Sidr-affected districts (see Annex-1).
    VGF is a means-tested program designed to provide additional food resources ina period of distress
    to a selected number o f women who are identifiedby UPS. To address the needs o f cyclone-affected
    households, 5,000 additional VGF cards are being allotted to every Up in the four most affected
    districts and 2,500 per UP in eight other districts, with each card entitling the recipient to 15
    hlograms o f rice per month for four months.15 This program will need an additional rice allocation
    o f 152,000 MT and is expected to cost Tk 3.12 billion, to be borne entirely from the FY08 budget.

    Death and medical benefits for cyclone-related deathdinjuries, and cash grants for rebuilding
    homesteads through the GR program (see Annex-1). Death benefits amount to Tk 20,000; medical
    benefits up to Tk 5,000 per person; and housing benefits Tk 10,000 and 6,000 for a fully and a
    partially destroyed home, respectively. The beneficiaries are selected by a team comprising of
    elected UP officials and certified by the District Commissioners. Total cost i s estimated to be Tk 5.14
    billion.

    Low-interest loans tofishermen rangingfrom Tk 50,000 to Tk 200,000. This i s estimated to cost Tk
    1.16billion.

    Low-interest loans to poultry and livestock farmers ranging from Tk 10,000 to Tk 50,000. The
    estimated cost i s Tk 0.86 billion.


l4  Past experiences with disaster responses have shown that rapidly distributed cash and/or in-kind assistance is
    especially effective in helping households cope with the devastating effects o f such shocks o n livelihoods and
    consumption. Recent examples o f successes with quick-disbursing cash and/or in-kindgrants include the 2004
    Asian tsunami, the Pakistan earthquake and the 1998 floods inBangladesh.
15  With each card given to one family, this should provide support to about 20,000 to 25,000 individuals in each
    UP in the worst affected districts, which i s virtually its entire population; while about half o f the UP'S
    population will be supported inthe moderately affected districts.

35.      The full program o f the government for cyclone relief, recovery, and medium to long term
restoration and rehabilitation i s estimated to cost US$ 2.1 billion. The part o f this program to be
implemented in FY08 i s estimated to cost US$520 million. Of this US$ 143 million will be provided
from the FY08 budget and another US$ 377 million will be met this year from additional foreign
assistance (ifavailable). The remaining will be provided in the medium to longer term from additional
foreign assistance. So far (as o f November 28, 2007), the government has incurred Tk 2.65 billion (US$
38.4 million) o f cyclone related expenditure, o f which 92 percent was for restoration and rehabilitation
and the remaining for food relief. About 56 percent o f these expenditures have been financed from the
FY08 safety net budget, 24 percent from the O&M budget, 10.3 percent from Block Allocation and the
remaining 10.3 percent from the ChiefAdviser's Relief and Welfare Fund.

36.      Bangladesh Bank (BB) has decided to extend its foreign currency liquidity support on a priority
basis to commercial banks to settle import bills for essentials, including foodgrains and petroleum
products. BB has also advised commercialbanks to provide cheaper short-term loans to cyclone-affected
fishermen and timber traders. Furthemore, BB has asked eight government-owned banks to intensify
disbursement o f fresh farm loans to cyclone-affected farmers, and i s closely monitoring the agriculture
credit disbursement process in both flood-hit and cyclone-affected areas. Under the new measures, the


                                                   13

cyclone-affected farmers will be eligible for fresh credit after rescheduling their previous classified loans.
BBhas set the credit target at about Tk 13 billion (US$188 million) from government-owned banks and
financial institutions and has asked them to disburse 70-80 percent o fthis target by December-January.

37.     The government's response in the immediate aftermath o f this disaster reflects significant
improvements in the institutional capacity to deal with emergency compared with previous natural
disasters o f this type, aided by GOB'Sadoption o f a Comprehensive Disaster Management Program
(CDMP) in 2003.        Improvements have occurred in terms o f policies to reduce leakages in food
distribution and allowing private sector to import, an effective and well-targeted Vulnerable Group
Feeding program, construction o f cyclone shelters, and establishment o f early warning systems. Recent
experiences also indicate that Bangladesh has been increasingly successful in providing assistance
through cash grants inemergency situations. Cash and food transfers are administered by the Ministry o f
Food and Disaster Management (MFDM) and distributed through local governments, employing
community based targeting methods. Bangladesh's disaster response system using casWfood grants has
been evaluatedinseveral international studies and found to be reasonably effective. An assessment o f the
cash grant and food aid programs post-1998 floods indicate that the GR program was reasonably well
targeted towards flood-affected households, while VGF was more successful intargeting poor households
(see Annex-1). The response capability o f civil administrations inproviding reliefhas also improved, and
government campaigns to educate households on food and water safety precautions during floods and
cyclones have proved effective.

Responseof developmentpartners

38.      There has been a swift response from the donor community.'6                 In coordination with the
Bangladesh Air Force, the UN i s distributing 208 tons o f high-energy biscuits to an estimated 850,000
people. 240,000 packets o f water-purifying powder are being distributed among 48,000 families. Shelter
materials will be distributed to 18,000 households whose houses were destroyed. Medical officers have
been made available to assist government response. The UNhas begunprocurement and distribution for
setting up tube wells, 100,000 Jerry cans, US$ 1.5 million worth o f medicines, 92 tons o f baby food,
 100,000 blankets, 60,000 family kits, 60,000 pieces o f children clothing, and 50,000 plastic sheets. US$
50,000 has been made available for water, supplies, and transportation.

39.      On November 21, the UNEmergency Relief Coordinator released the second round o f Central
Emergency ReliefFund(CERF) allocation for activities inheath, telecommunications, emergency shelter
and non-food items. This i s in addition to the initial CERF allocation for projects in agnculture, child
protection, food, nutrition and water and sanitation disbursed on 19 November. Earlier, on November 16,
the International Federation o f Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) launched a preliminary
emergency appeal to support the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society to assist 235,000 beneficiaries for a
period o f nine months. Total commitments by development partners (excluding the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank), as o f December 12, have amounted to US$223 million (Table 6). The Asian
Development Bank (ADB) has pledged US$180 million (including US$60 million from bilateral donors).

40.      Coordination o f relief effort was a major challenge for the Government, particularly inthe early
days when several national and international NGOs, supported by the donors, spontaneously initiated
relief operations. The M o F D M in collaboration with the UnitedNations Resident Coordinator (UNRC)
moved quickly to establish a UNDonor Coordination Mechanism, holding its first meetingjust two days
after the cyclone. A small secretariat was establishedto provide support to the Secretary, MoFDM, and to
assist himinmeetingthe growing list o f demands.

    term restoration and rehabilitation program will be
    underpinned by a strategy to aid recovery and preparedness that focuses on improving relief
    responses, reducing exposure to natural hazards and enhancing coping ability over the medium and
    long-term. The Bank has started developing such a medium to long-term strategy to anchor its
    program. Among the areas where Bank assistance may be needed are rebuilding livelihoods in the
    medium-tern; improving coastal defenses including rehabilitation o f embankments and upgrading
    and expanding cyclone shelters; river banks strengthening to reduce flood risks; and improving
    mechanisms for risk management including disaster-risk financing. A preliminary estimate o f the
    size o f the Bank's long-term program is around US$125 million. The design of the long-term
    strategy and the Bank's comprehensive program will be guided by the findings o f the DNA noted
    earlier.

discussed with key development partners and fits into the overall plan for external assistance for cyclone
recovery.

            nII.THEREFORM         PROGRAMSUPPORTEDTHROUGH DSC                   Iv:ANUPDATE

43.      As noted at the beginning o f this document, the DSC series has supported GOB'Sreform efforts
along two pillars: (a) strengthening core governance functions, with emphasis on reforms in public
procurement, budget formulation and budget execution, tax administration, and public administration; and
(b) improving the investment climate, by maintaining macroeconomic stability, deepening domestic
deregulation and trade liberalization, and strengthening performance o f the banlung and energy sectors
and o f state-owned enterprises."

44.      The government i s committed to deepening these reforms and has shown progress so far despite
the major distractions caused by natural events like floods and cyclone, which threaten to take away both
financing as well as administrative focus, thus disrupting reforms. A description o f the reform efforts-
past, ongoing and needed inthe future-that      underpin the country's development vision i s provided inthe
DSC IV do~ument.'~The following paragraphs provide a brief update date on the reforms since the
approval o f DSC IVby the Board inMay 2007.

A. Progress on poverty and social development

45.      Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty over the last 15 years. In early
1990s, close to 60 percent o f the population was living inpoverty; the poverty rate declined to 49 percent
in 2000 and 40 percent by 2005.        If the current trends in growth and inequality were to continue,
Bangladeshwill meet its MDG o fhalving its poverty rate from 57 percent in 1990 to 29 percent by 2015.
The steep decline in the poverty rate from 2000 to 2005 was significant enough to reduce the number of
people inpoverty (with a growing population) by nearly 6 million between 2000 and 2005. The reduction
inpoverty is attributable mainly to a 3.7 percent annual average growth inreal GDP per capita during
2000-05 with almost no increase inconsumption inequality (as measuredby the Gini index) since 1996.

46.      Improvements in quality o f life between 2000 and 2005 were not limited to consumption, but
were also seen for indicators such as housing conditions, access to electricity, sanitation, and telephone
connections. Bangladesh i s on track to meet its MDG on gender parity, having already achieved the goal
in primary and secondary schooling.        Significant gains have also been achieved in reducing child
mortality. The under-five mortality rate has fallen from 136 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 66
today. Attaining the MDGs relating to child malnutrition and those in education relating to universal net
primary enrollment andprimary completion remains challenging but within reach. Bangladesh has also
nearly achieved the safe water MDG, with 97 percent o f its population having access to pathogen-free
water, before arsenic contamination posed a new round o f challenges.20

47.      Analysis o f poverty reduction suggests that a lot o f the economic gains during 2000-05 among
households took place as a result o f higher incomes generated from available assets and occupations,
which inturn indicate the beneficial impact o f economic growth. Poverty reduction i s linkedto wage and



l8  The DSC IV reform program is closely aligned with the reform pillars outlined in GOB'SPoverty Reduction
    Strategy (PRS) presented to the boards o f the International Development Agency (IDA) and the International
    Monetary Fund(IMF) in early 2006. The DSCs have complemented a parallel Special Drawing Right (SDR)
    347 million Poverty Reduction Grant Facility (PRGF) program o f the IMF, which ended in June 2007.
    Currently, the IMFhas an economic surveillance facility in Bangladesh.

productivity increase in the industry sector, along with substantial employment growth in the service
sector. Increasedinflow o fremittances is also likely to haveplayed an important role.

48.      Substantial challenges, however, still lie ahead. Around 56 million Bangladeshis remained in
poverty in2005. Regions inthe west and southwest (Rajshahi, Barisal, and Khulna divisions) have fallen
significantly behind those in the east (Dhaka, Chittagong, and Sylhet divisions). Dhaka and Chittagong
contributed nearly 80 percent o f national poverty reduction between 2000 and 2005, with just over half
the population, while Khulna and Barisal, with about one-fifth o f the population, made no contribution.
The November cyclone has pushed the lagging regions further behind. Lack o f economic growth inthese
regions i s related to poor connectivity to the main growth centers o f the country (most importantly,
Dhaka), inadequate infrastructure, and lower inflow o f remittances. Closing this regional economic
divide would be an important area o f focus for public policy, as the CTG has stated publicly on repeated
occasions.

    B.       Reform progress since the approval of DSCIV

49.      The progress made as part o f the DSC IV-supported initiatives in strengthening the banhng
sector, liberalizing the trade regime, strengthening tax administration, and reforms to improve the
functioning o f core governance institutions has been encouraging. The reform momentum in recent
months has remained strong. Since the approval o f SF1, the Government has undertaken a number o f
governance-related measures, including (i)     completion o f the legal steps to separate the judiciary from the
executive; (ii) amendment o f the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) act to enhance its independence
and clarify its jurisdiction; (iii)constitution o f a Regulatory Reforms Commission to strengthen the
regulatory environment; (iv) constitution o f a Bangladesh Better Business Forum; and, (v) finalization o f
the rules to implement the Procurement Act. Progress has also been good in improving governance inthe
power sector, especially in tendering o f large baseload power plants, a process previously rife with
corruption. The following paragraphs provide updates on reformprogress by specific areas:

(i)Macroeconomicstability

50.      With the implementation o f economic reforms envisaged in the Poverty Reduction Strategy
(PRS), growth was expected to be sustained at around 6.5 to 7 percent over the medium term, with the
industrial sector continuingto be the main driver. The combined impact o f the July-September floods and
the cyclone i s likely to reduce current year growth to the 5.5-6.0 percent range. The impact o f these
natural disasters, as inthe past, i s expected to subside in subsequent years.

51.      The FYO8 budget has come under severe pressure from the three shocks: international oil and
non-oil commodity price increases, the July-September floods, and now the cyclone.                Administered
petroleum prices were last adjusted on April 1,2007. Since then oil prices have increased by US$33 per
barrel ininternational markets. Urea prices have not been adjusted inlast eleven years duringwhich urea
import price has increasedby Tk 25,000 per ton. Inadequate pass-through o f international fuel and urea
prices to domestic consumers has resulted in state energy and chemical companies accumulating large
losses, adding to the already high stocks of their outstanding uncovered liabilities. In the absence o f
domestic price adjustments, the FYO8budget faces an extra US$ 80 million pressure arising from subsidy
to energy and fertilizer not provided for in the original budget, which anticipated more benign global
commodity prices and assumed necessary adjustments to administered prices. The floods added roughly
US$ 500 million o f unforeseen expenditure and now the cyclone will likely add another US$ 520 million
this fiscal year. The total flood and cyclone induced expenditure shock constitutes 8.9 percent o f the
original FY08 budget o fabout US$ 11.5 billion.




                                                   17

52.       These shocks have resulted in a precarious fiscal situation.                 Assuming no adjustment in
administered prices, revenue performance inline with budget target, and central government expenditures
at normal trend, and factoring in the additional energy and urea subsidy plus the additional cyclone and
flood-related expenditures, the Central Government deficit i s estimated to rise to about 5.4 percent o f
GDP in FY08, compared to 3.5 percent projected without the additional budgetary expenditure arising
from the three external shocks. Assuming US$ 225 million flood- and cyclone-induced increase in net
foreign financing, domestic financing would rise to 2.8 percent o f GDP inthe absence o f any expenditure
and price adjustments, compared to 1.5 percent inthe absence o f the shocks.

53.       Having nearly exhausted the potential for reallocating expenditure within the FY08 budget, the
government i s faced with three policy choices, each o f which would prove to be unpleasant to certain
sections o f the population:

1. Raise domestic energy and fertilizer prices sufficiently (i.e., to reflect import cost) to create fiscal
     space for desired levels o f developmental and natural disaster-related expenditure. T h ~ s ,o f course, is
     a very sensitive issue politically.
2. Allow the flood and cyclone related expenditures without administered price and other adjustments
     and face heightened inflationary pressures on top o f the already tense inflation situation, being
     mindfulthat inflationparticularly hurts the poor. Or, crowd out productive private investment owing
     to increased government borrowing.
3. Narrow the gap between administered prices and import cost of fuel and fertilizer and further cut
     ADP expenditure, and finance the remainder through increasedborrowing. This would leadto some
     combination of higher inflation, lower public spending in desired areas, and smaller transfers to those
     benefiting fkom energy and fertilizer subsidies.

54.       The resolution to the policy predicament will require implementation o f a more decisive
administered pricing strategy, creation of fiscal space through revenue enhancement, and more efficient
public expenditure management.             Whatever i s the choice made by the government, based on its
competing priorities, the adverse terms o f trade shocks, one way or the other, will, however, extract a
substantial cost fkom the economy as a whole. The only question i s who i s made to bear that cost.

55.       The short-run solution to this policy dilemma, however, is not easy. Clearly, option 2 is the least
desirable o f the three from GOB'Spoint o f view. Option 1, though desirable, does not seem feasible inthe
near term because o f political sensitivities.21 By default, that leaves only option 3. Resistance on account
o f higher prices can be mitigated with targeted subsidies. The adjustment pain can also be at least
partially mitigated inthe short runthrough increasedconcessional foreign assistance.

(ii) Banking: Corporatizatiodprivatization ofNationalCommercialBanks (NCBs)

56.       The corporatization process has been completed for three o f the four NCBs. Sonali, Janata and
Agrani banks have each been formally converted into public limited companies, and their assets,
liabilities and capital transferreddivested in entirety to the newly formed banlung companies. Exclusion
o f the three NCBs from Bangladesh Bank Nationalization Order 1972 was announced through a gazette
notification.    The new banking companies are now being operated by independent management and
boards o f directors in accordance with the Companies Act o f 1994. The Finance Division has hrther


21   It is instructive to note that large SOE losses emanating from keeping administered prices low shifts public
     resources in favor o f the better-off at the expense o f the poor. Higher subsidy to cover SOE losses-that   the
     better-off enjoy the most-comes      at the expense o f pro-poor expenditures, including on human development
     and rural infrastructure. It is indeed ironic that the arguments against price adjustments are made inthe name o f
     the poor by the beneficiaries o f low administered prices-urban   and rural middle and upper classes.

directed the new banks to draw up their respective action plans by December 2007 to overcome their
capital andprovisioning shortfalls withthe BB.

57.      Despite the government's good-faith effort to divest its 93 percent stake o f Rupali Bank Limited,
a formal response is yet to be received from the preferred bidder, who has been delaying the signing o f
the Sales and Purchase Agreement. The government i s now considering closure o f this long-pending deal
and reinitiatingthe process o fprivatization o fthe bank.

(iii)State-owned enterprises: Restructuring

58.      Government efforts to contain the losses o f SOEs are ongoing in some sectors. A s part o f this
effort, four loss-making jute mills were shut down in July 2008. The Government has also reduced the
size o f the labor force in SOEs under four public sector corporations-namely,           Bangladesh Biman,
Bangladesh Jute Mills Corporation (BJMC), Bangladesh Textile Mills Corporation (BTMC), and
Bangladesh FreedomFighter Welfare Trust. Fundedby the Government's Voluntary Retirement Scheme
(VRS), 16,237 workers have beenretired so far inFY08.

59.      Bangladesh Biman i s now planning further cost reduction by retiring more staff through VRS,
while worlung out public-private partnership models for its operation and ownership, as well as other
restructuring measures to make its operations more profitable. Inaddition, Government i s considering
closing down eight more loss-mahngjute mills under BJMC inthe coming months. Along with payment
o f VRS the Government also has an ongoing counseling and retraining program as part o f a Social
Protection Package for the retired SOE workers. This social protection package i s being executed by
BRAC, a leadingNGO.

(iv) Power sector

60.      The Government has started implementation o f the least-cost generation development plan. T o
support implementation o f the generation expansion program, the Government i s in the middle o f
finalizing a generation financing strategy, which is designed to integrate least-cost selection o f projects
within an overall public andprivate financing framework.

61.      The Government has appointed Transaction Advisors for three large base-load power plants. For
the Bibyana 450 MW Independent Power Producer (IPP) Government has pre-qualified five sponsors and
the transaction process i s on track.    The other two IPPs are following a staggered schedule.           The
Expression o f Interest (EOI) for Sirajgonj 450 MW IPP is due on December 11, 2007 and the request for
EO1for Meghnaghat 450 MW IPP will be issued soon after pre-qualifying the Sirajgonj 450 MW IPP.
Contracts have also been awarded to six sponsors to set up 10 small power plants. These sponsors have
been selected, through a transparent and competitive process under the Government's Small Power
Generation Policy. The contracted commercial operation dates for these power plants are on or before
January 10,2009. Fromthese power plants a total o f 220 MW o fpower will be generated.

62.      The Government has adopted the Financial Restructuring Plan, in principle, and has appointed
auditors to start restructuring the balance sheets of all power utilities. Provision o f Tk 6 billion has been
made inthe FY08 budget to cover power sector losses as power tariffs are below cost.

63.      A new Chairman has been appointed inBERC. The appointment o f the last (5*) member o f the
Commission has also been appointed. For BERC to be fully operational it needs to appoint its staff - for
which they required approval on (i)     Organogram, (ii)   Service Regulation and (ii) o f Equipment.
                                                                                         Table
The organogram has already been approved. The Energy Division i s now incorporating the Ministry of

Law's comments on the Service Regulation and expects Ministry o f Law's final vetting soon. The Table
of Equipmenthasbeen approved bythe Ministries o fFinance and Establishment.

(v) Trade andtax administration

64.      Average nominal import tariff protection was cut from 24.3 percent to 21.9 percent in the FY08
budget. Furthermore, the tariff structure was simplified by collapsing the Infrastructural Development
Surcharge with the customs duty and eliminating zero-tariff status for many products. A significant trade
liberalization agenda remains, however, as, by most measures, Bangladesh i s still among the most
protected economies inthe world. The CTG has expressed its commitment to deepen trade liberalization
and reduce the anti-export bias inthe coming months and the FY09 budget.

65.      The CTG has repeatedly expressed concerns regarding the poor tax collection in the country-at
8 percent o f GDP in FY07, tax mobilization inBangladesh i s among the lowest inthe world. The CTG
has initiated separation o f the tax policy function from tax administration, and has agreed to review the
VAT and income tax legislations as part of simplifyingits tax system. It has introduced universal self-
assessment inincome tax, direct trader input (DTI) inimport cargo clearance, and is workmg to merge the
VAT and ITLarge Taxpayer Unitsunder the NBR.

(vi) Publicfinancialmanagementandprocurement

66.      Notable actions inthese areas include:

     o More strategic and performance oriented budget management process across the ministries under
         MTBF; Integrated Financial Management Information system through IBAs; and Project Audit
         Manual for improved audit reports for donor assisted projects.

     o The Government is puttinginplace an ad-hoc Public Accounts Committee (PAC) inthe absence
         o f an elected Parliament. The move has receivedpositive nod from all concerned.

     o Based on the newly passed Procurement Act, the Government has finalized the rules and, after
         endorsement o f the Finance Adviser, it is now at the final stage o f approval by the Ministry o f
         Law, before it i s gazetted and given effect.

     o Transparency o f the procurement system is improving further with the beginning of posting
         procurement performance data in the website o f Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU) by
         the Rural ElectrificationBoard (REB) and LGED. For these two organizations, the annual report
         for FY06 has already been posted in CPTU's website for contracts valued at Tk 10 million and
         above and the report for FY07 i s expected to be published inDecember, 2007.

 (vii) Governanceand anticorruption

67.      Governance and anti-corruption reforms have occupied center stage duringthe CTG's tenure thus
far. Reform efforts have sought to strengthen the key institutions o f accountability, by clarifying their
mandate and providing them the requisite resources (financial and manpower) to carry out their tasks.
Key measures have included:


0    Concrete steps to comply with a six-year-old High Court ruling to separate the judiciary from the
     executive branch o f Government.       Amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code that came into




                                                  20

    operation on November 1, 2007, and two new sets o f Rules22are important milestones. The related
    administrative requirements, including the creation o f and appointments to new magisterialposts, and
    the provision o f court infrastructure, are proceeding.

    Initiation o f internal reforms in the Public Service Commission, under the guidance o f a new
    chairman and members.         The Government i s discussing the prospect of a right to information
    ordinance to improve transparency in its functioning.        The importance o f such an act has been
    publicly endorsed by senior officials including the chief adviser.
    An inter-agency approach to tackling corruption, which appears to be yielding results. The Anti-
    corruption Commission's jurisdiction has been clarified through amendments to the ACC Act, and
    necessary rules for its operation have come into effect. Bangladesh acceded to the United Nations
    Convention Against Corruption in February and i s reviewing its legal and regulatory framework to
    ensure compliance with the Convention. Meanwhile, corruption cases against a number o f former
    politicians andbusinessmen are proceeding.

    A seven-member Local Government Committee formed by the CTGinJune has recommended a far-
    reaching decentralization agenda. Recommendations included establishment o f a Local Government
    Commission to regulate and steer the decentralization process, and draft unifiedordinance for Zila,
    Upazila and UnionParishads, municipalities, and city corporations.

    Constitution o f a 17-member Regulatory Reforms Commission to amend the administrative rules and
    regulations to facilitate doing business. In its first meeting, the commission prioritized amendments
    to the rules relating to duty, bonded warehouses, environmental certification, customs and foreign
    loans approval process. The commission will submit recommendations to the Government every
    month, which will be posted on an official website to ensure transparency and public awareness. It
    submitted the first set o frecommendations on December 4,2007.

    Constitution o f the Bangladesh Better Business Forum (BBBF), a public-private platform, to foster
    dialogue between the Government and the private sector. The Forum will be headed by the Chief
    Adviser, and will bringtogether government policymakers, chief o f a m y staff, business leaders, civil
    society members and economists.

                     Ix.RATIONALEFOR          PROPOSEDSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCING

68.      GOB'Sresponse to the devastation caused by Sidr is placing severe pressure on the (already
overburdened) FY08 budget. Inthe absence o f the proposed financing, Government would need to cut
further into its existing O&M budget, reduce planned capital spending allocations (ADP), or significantly
scale down support to recurrent expenditure activities. Alternatively, the Government will have to fall
back on much more expensive domestic borrowing or use monetary financing, which will fuel already
highinflation. Reacting swiftly, GOBhas already redirected some o f its limited budgetary resources for
cyclone rescue and relief. Grants or concessionary financing from development partners insupport o f the
additional resource requirement would be critical to meeting the country's recovery and development
needs.

69.      The World Bank i s well placed to assist the country in its hour o f need, and the proposed SF2
budget support operation would be an efficient and timely instrument inresponse to GOB'Smost pressing
spending needs arising from the cyclone. SF2 would provide cash assistance to the budget relatively
quickly to help finance part o f the FYO8 resource gap incurred as a result of the cyclone, which makes it


22  These are the Bangladesh Judicial Service (Service Constitution, Composition, Recruitment and Suspension,
    Dismissal & Removal) Rules and the Bangladesh Judicial Service (Posting, Promotion, Leave, Control,
    Discipline and other Service Conditions) Rules.



                                                   21

preferable over other forms o f emergency assistance. The resources provided under SF2 will help protect
GOB'Sreform program that were supported under DSC IV and have since remained broadly on track
despite the three external shocks. The SF2 operation i s part o f the collective response from development
partners such as the ADB, DFID,UN, Japan, USAID and others.

70.     As noted earlier, a formal damage and needs assessment i s ongoing and would inform the extent
and nature o f the medium- and longer-term recovery and rehabilitation support needed by the country.
The associated costs are likely to be high, however. Fromavailable information, it i s already clear that
the human, social, and economic impacts would be sizeable (see Table 3, Section II).              The impact on
growth and employment i s likely to occur as a result of setbacks in agricultural production, losses in
fisheries and livestock assets, and damage to infrastructure, transport, and communication (see Section
11).

71.      The proposed operation i s consistent with Bankpolicy as reflectedinOP 8.60.23


                                  X. IMPLEMENTATION         ARRANGEMENTS

A. Terms ofthe SupplementalFinancing
72.      The only condition to the effectiveness o f the FinancingAgreement i s the receipt o f a satisfactory
legal opinion from the borrower. There will, however, be an overall requirement that the government
continue to maintain a satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework as was required under the DSC
series. Continued close engagement with the IMF will help the country in this effort. The closing date
for the Supplemental Financingi s June 30,2008.

B. Fundsflow and disbursementarrangementfor the SupplementalFinancing

73.      Supplemental Financing proceeds will be disbursed ina single tranche and will be deposited into
a specific deposit account o f the Ministry o f Finance and Planning established at Bangladesh Bank for
this purpose; the deposit account is part o f the country's official foreign exchange reserves. An amount
equivalent to the Credit proceeds will then be credited to an account of the Government to finance
budgeted expenditures. Transactions and balances o f the Government account will be fully incorporated
into the Government's accounting records and financial statements. Disbursement will not be linked to
any specific purchases and no procurement requirements will be needed. If any portion o f the Credit
proceeds i s used for ineligible purposes as defined by the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the
Borrower either to return that amount to the deposit account or refund the amount directly to IDA.

74.      Fiduciary arrangements for this operation are the same as those used for managing the
Government's own foreign exchange reserves at the Central Bank and budgetary resources through the
treasury system. While recent assessments o f these fiduciary arrangements continue to highlight a weak
environment, efforts have been made inrecent years to improve the systems, with significant results.

     e   A comprehensive reformeffort to improve PFMinstitutions is ongoing. This includes reforms to
         improve budget planning, accounting and auditing o f government transactions, financial reporting
         and procurement. Accounting transactions are being computerized, improving the accuracy and
         timeliness o f public financial information. Reconciliation o f budget accounts and corresponding
        bank accounts i s improving and computerization i s being extended to capture these transactions.



23  According to this policy, supplemental financing may be provided for a development policy operation for which
     an anticipated gap in financing jeopardizes a reform program that i s otherwise proceeding on schedule and in
     compliance with the agreed-on policy agenda.



                                                    22

     0   The IMF safeguard assessment confirms that Bangladesh Bank's safeguards framework has been
         strengthened in a number o f areas, including publication o f its financial accounts (as per
         InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards), reconciliation o f monetary data reported to the IMF
         with the audited accounts, and improvements inforeign exchange management. Since FY03, BB
         has had its financial statements audited by internationally affiliated audit firms in full compliance
         with international auditing standards. The entries o f the deposit account will, upon request from
         IDA, be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA under terms of reference in
         accordance with international standards on auditing.

C. Environmentalissues

75.      Policies supported by the proposed Supplemental Financing are not expected to have any
significantnegative effects on the environment, naturalresources, or forests.


                                          XI.BENEFITSANDRISKS

A. Benefits
76.      GOB'Sresponse to Sidr in terms o f relief, livelihood support and reconstruction requires timely
financial support. The proposed SF2 would be an important and among the more reliable instruments in
response to the more immediate spending needs o f the Government. Pledges from bilateral donors to date
have amounted to roughly US$ 220 million. Pledges typically have a longer gestation lag than desired
and so flexible financing o f the type being proposed i s necessary to speed up the rehabilitation process.
Being quick disbursing, the proposed SF2 would help the government provide timely assistance to
affected populations and allow flexible allocation o f resources in response to urgent and evolving needs.
It also fits into the Bank's proposed cyclone assistance strategy-by       providing the emergency support
needed by the government in the immediate aftermath o f the disaster, while a more comprehensive
medium to long term recovery program i s developed, to be implemented on the ground only after the
immediatereliefoperations are complete.

77.      The proposed SF2 will also contribute to minimizing the risks to implementation o f the overall
reform program supported through the DSC series, and maintaining the reform momentum in key
development areas that could be supported by a potential TSC being discussed for late FY08.

B. Risks
78.      There are risks involved with these types o f assistance, which are also borne out by experiences
inother countries. An important risk has to do with limited administrative capacity to implement relief,
restoration and reconstruction operations. This risk inBangladesh, however, i s partly mitigated by recent
evidence that confirms the country's growing capacity for effectively managing and coping with natural
disasters. The significantly lower number o f human lives lost during Sidr compared with past cyclones o f
similar intensity is a testament to this progress.

79.      GOBapproved a medium to long-term strategy on disaster management in2003, which laid out a
Comprehensive Disaster Management Program (CDMP). The response to the 2007 flood emergency and
to the November cyclone so far reflects these improvements, in particular takmg into consideration the
difficulties o f reaching remote communities when communications are interruptedand means are limited.
The macroeconomic and social impact o f natural disasters has been greatly reduced and the vulnerability
o f the poor has been diminished, through a combination of policy measures, and improvements in safety
net programs, disaster awareness, early warning systems, shelters and the capacity o f civil administration.




                                                  23

In addition, the country's renowned NGOs play an increasingly important role in disaster prevention,
recovery, and relief, enabling the government to respondpromptly to disasters.

80.      Bangladesh i s inherently vulnerable to natural disasters. It is frequently visited by cyclones,
storm surges and floods which in their wake claim many lives, affect millions o f people and extensively
damage public and private property. Global warming and the resulting climate change have increased the
likelihood that the fi-equency o f such disasters may increase. While the proposed SF2 does not address
these risks, the multi-pronged strategy of which it i s a part will aim at assisting the long-term mitigation
o f natural disaster damage. Inaddition, the World Bank, ADB, W A C , other specialized UNagencies,
and several donor countries are also helping strengthen the government's capacity to respond to and
mitigate future natural disaster damage. One area o f focus would be improving the current warning signal
alerting system to ensure that communities can better understand the level o f actual risk they face and
what they must do to protect themselves and their livelihoods.

81.      Fungibility o f funds implies that budgetary resources may be diverted or misused, which poses a
particular fiduciary risk to budget-support operations like the proposed SF2. GOB,however, has a good
record o f allocating public spending to key development sectors and emergency relief and rehabilitation
activities, as seen in the context o f earlier natural disasters. The fact that GOBhas already redirected
some o f its limited budgetary resources for cyclone relief (as noted earlier) also indicates its commitment
towards relief expenditures.     Auditing arrangements and financial management within government
ministries are being strengthened (refer to paragraph 74 above), which further mitigates the risk o f
resources being misused.

82.      An additional risk is associated with the political situation in the country, which continues to
remain fluid. In late August, a trivial incident at Dhaka University triggered widespread protests at a
number o f universities throughout Bangladesh, some o f which spilled out into the streets. These protests
were seen as the most serious threat yet to political stability since the current CTG took office, with calls
from some for an end to the emergency rule. While the CTG controlled the law and order situation
quickly by imposing a curfew in several cities, there continues to be a risk o f such outbursts.
Mismanagement o f the post-cyclone relief, restoration and rehabilitation could trigger such outbursts as
well, which seems to have already occurred in a couple o f locations, including a demonstration in
Barguna demanding food and clothes on December 3. Such incidents can become a flashpoint for wider
protests, and any prolonged period o f protests may take the focus o f the Government away from much-
needed economic reforms.        While these risks exist, the proposed operation will contribute towards
mitigating these by providing the country with more resources to address the economic and social impact
o f the cyclone. Moreover, the risks listed needto be also assessedagainst the potential reputationrisk for
the Bank if it was seen as not responding at this critical hour o f need in a country that suffers from
repeated disasters because o f its geo-physical location along with, perhaps, the effects of global climate
change.

     GOVERNMENT      PROGRAMSTO SUPPORT CONSUMPTIONOF CYCLONE AFFECTEDHOUSEHOLDS

The Government o f Bangladesh (GOB)has moved rapidly to respondto the cyclone emergency through a
package o f measures designed to provide a consumption cushion and assist inrecovery o f assets using a
comprehensive program o f cash and food transfers, which have been used to respond to previous disasters
with significant success.     Bangladesh's disaster response system using casWfood grants has been
evaluated in several international studies and found to be reasonably effective.24           There are four
government safety net programs that can potentially be used to provide emergency relief to disaster
victims, including cash grants, and these are included inthe Government's budget. Two o f these are being
used as o f now to assist cyclone victims. Cash and food transfers are administered by the Ministry of
Food and Disaster Management (MoFDM) and distributed through local governments, employing a
community based targeting method.

While medium term recovery o f livelihoods and assets will require a more comprehensive program, the
programs listed below represent the safety net initiatives to protect the consumption o f the cyclone-
affected in the short term, through cash or food aid. In addition to these programs, as noted in the
program document, the other important short-term relief measures employed by GOBare low-interest
loans to fishermen, poultry and livestock farmers, assistance on inputsfor farmers, and import o frice.

Gratuitous Relief (GR) provides immediate cash/ food grants to households following disasters -
administered by the local governments (Union ParishadsAJPs) and central government officials based in
the Upazila. GR appears to have been well-targeted in the aftermath o f past disasters, including after the
1998 flood. Reported leakages to non deserving beneficiaries and fraud were also kept to a minimum.
The Government plans to use GR program for provision o f death, medical and housing benefits to Sidr-
affected households on an emergency basis. Death benefits amount to Taka 20,000; medical benefits up
to Taka 5,000 per person; and housing benefits Taka 10,000 for a fully destroyed house and Taka 6,000
for a partially destroyed house. The beneficiaries are selected by a team comprising elected UP officials
and certified by the District Commissioner (DC).

Vulnerable Group Feeding (VGF) is a means-tested program designed to provide additional food
resources to a selected number o f women ina period o f distress. Usually, the women selected by the UP
chairman receive a card that entitles them to receive a given amount o f grain a month for a period o f two
months. In the past, while VGF appears to have been well targeted within the UP, the geographic
distribution o f VGF cards was not always consistent with that o f the disaster. To address this problem, the
government has announced that each UP inthe four worst affected districts will receive 5,000 VGF cards
while those inthe other affected districts will receive 2,500. This should provide support to about 20,000
to 25,000 individuals in each UP in the worst affected districts, which i s virtually its entire population;
while about half o f the UP'Spopulation will be supported inthe moderately affected districts. Each VGF
card will entitle the recipient to 15 lulograms o f rice per month for four months.    The Government has
opted for food rather than cash transfers partly out o f a concern that because o f communication
bottlenecks in the area that restrict the supply o f commodities, cash grants may fuel local inflation. To
move the VGF foodgrain, the government would get assistance from the military, which has very good
logistic capacity.

To understand how the safety net system in Bangladesh functions in the aftermath of a disaster, a study
will be conducted with World Bank support, collectinginformation fromprogram implementers like local
government representatives, beneficiaries and other stakeholders, following a simple template or
questionnaire. The findings from the study will inform GOBin developing future plans to enhance or
modify post-disaster casWfood assistance programs, which would be an integral part o f its strategy for
disaster-preparedness.

Assessment of effectiveness of various government programsfollowing the 1998JIoodsf'

A number o f instruments have been used by the Government o f Bangladesh to provide immediate food
relief to the people in the aftermath o f the 1998 flood. The main instruments implemented were the
Gratuitous Relief (GR), the Vulnerable Group Feeding Program (VGF), the Test Relief (TR) and the
Food for Work (FFW).

As a part o f the GRprogram, grain, a little bit o fcash and other supplies (clothes and biscuits) were given
to the districts. Eventually, the grain was given to the UP chairmen who distributed it in small rations o f
3 to 10 hlograms to the people believed to need it the most. Through the VGF program, inthe period o f
August and September 1998, approximately one million women received 8 lulograms o f rice for two
months. In October, the number o f women was increased to 4 million and the ration was increased to 8
kgo frice and 8 kgo fwheat. InNovember, the number o fparticipants was increasedto 4.2 million and in
December the number o f rations was increased to 15 kg of wheat and 5 kg o f rice. The program ran until
April 1999. Other programs such as the TR and the FFW are public works programs, which were not
fully operational inthe immediate aftermath o fthe flood and started after January 1999.

Average size of transfers and number of people covered: Average amount o f the transfer for VFG in
1998 was first 8 kg o f wheat a month to 2 million poor women for 4 months.             Later the number o f
beneficiaries was increased first to 4 million and finally to 8 million. The allocation was also increased to
16 kg o f grain for a period o f 8 months. At the time the monetary value o f the transfer was between 100
and 150 Tk per month.

The amount o f the transfer o f the GR in 1998 was about 100 Tk for the households inmost severe flood
exposure areas. The number o f beneficiaries is not clear since the transfers were handed out to the
districts and then to the Upazila which gave them to the UP chairman that distributed. The data shows
that the amounts distributedalso depended on the level o f severity o f the exposure to the flood.

Targeting experience in 1998: The VGF program was not effectively targeted in accordance with flood
exposure. 18.7% o f the households not directly exposed to the flood received cards, only a little below
the percentage o f households very severely exposed to the flood (24.5%). This was seemingly done by
design since some districts that had not been affected by the flood also received an allocation o f cards,
albeit ina smaller number.

GR was better targeted towards flood-affected households than VGF. Only 9.6% of households not
directly affected by the flood received assistance through the short term GR program, compared with
36.7% o f the very severely affected households. VGF was better targeted to the poor than was GR,
50.9% o f VGF recipients were relatively non-poor households that belong to the top 60% o f the per capita

Incontrast to VGF, transfers from NGOsappearto bewell targetedto households affectedby the flood.
24.5% of the very severely flood-exposedhouseholds received transfers from NGO's, compared with
only 2.7% ofthe non-floodexposedhouseholds.
