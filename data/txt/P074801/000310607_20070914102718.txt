                                          I.BACKGROUND

1.      Bangladesh has made steady social and economic progress in the last several years.
Poverty was reduced by an average o fnearly 2 percentage points annually; from 49 percent o f the
population living in poverty in 2000 to 40 percent in 2005.          If the current rate of poverty
reduction continues, Bangladesh will meet its Millennium Development Goal (MDG) o f halving
its poverty rate from 57 percent in 1990 to 29 percent by 2015. Rapid poverty reduction i s
attributable mainly to strong and stable economic growth-annual           Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) growth has accelerated by 1percentagepoint every decade, and i s now above 6 percent a
year.   Despite periodic natural disasters (particularly floods) and frequent political turmoil,
Bangladesh i s the only low-income country to have maintained stable positive GDP growth since
the 1990s.

2.       The private sector's contribution to these developments in Bangladesh has been quite
impressive. It i s reflected in the rapid growth inmanufacturing, acceleration o f garment exports;
rising remittances from Bangladeshis living abroad; and substantial investment in textiles,
banking, and telecommunications. Improvements in broad development outcomes, including
education, health, sanitation and gender parity indicators, are also partly attributable to a vibrant
civil society and nongovernmental organization (NGO) movement that has played an important
role inexpanding access to microfinance, and providing basic services and creating awareness on
health, fertility and education. Notwithstanding this progress, Bangladeshremains a low-income
country, with a per capita GDP o f about US$490 in2007 and a poverty rate that i s still high. This
indicates that the country still has a lot to do to assure a basic minimumliving standard for all its
citizens.

3.       To further accelerate poverty reduction and economic growth, the Government o f
Bangladesh (GOB) has launched an ambitious program o f policy reforms and institutional
strengthening, articulated most recently in its 2005 Poverty Reduction Strategy entitled
"Bangladesh: Unloclung the Potential."         Moreover, spurred by growing citizen demand for
curbing corruption, the fight against weak governance and corruption has become the topmost
priority for government policy. The Caretaker Government (CTG)-a           nonpartisan Government
established under Bangladesh's Constitution to assist and oversee the conduct o f free, fair, and
credible elections-has    pursued this central mandate with vigor. Ithas, inaddition, pursued a far-     '

reaching agenda o f institutional reform that i s broadly seen as necessary for democratic
consolidation. These include reform o f the electoral process, political parties, and campaign
financing; separation o fthe judiciary from the executive; and strengthening the independence and
neutrality o f the Election Commission, Anti-Corruption Commission, and Public Service
Commission. At the centre o f this drive to improve governance i s a robust anticorruption effort,
which has strong popular support, although some concerns have been voiced about compliance
with due process and about the ongoing state o f emergency.

4.       The current CTG took office in January 2007 following the declaration o f a state o f
emergency, after a protracted period o f political unrest that had caused the parliamentary



                                                    1

elections to be postponed.          The CTG i s being assisted by the country's defense forces in
maintaining law and order and preparing for elections. Indicating the CTG's commitment to
holding free and fair elections, the Election Commission (EC) released an electoral roadmap on
July 15 with the next parliamentary election scheduled for the end o f 2008, while local
government elections are expected to begin in January 2008. This timetable has been recently
reiterated publicly by the CTG, and the preparation o f a digitized voter list has commenced. The
EC has announced a schedule o f consultations on electoral reforms with 15 main political parties
starting September 12. To facilitate t h s dialogue, the Chief Adviser in his address to the nation
on September 9 announced lifting o fban on indoor politics with effect from September 10,2007.'
Despite dissatisfaction with the undemocratic behavior o f the major political parties in the past,
there i s a broad consensus among citizens and the CTG about a future return to a system o f
democratically elected government.

5.        Policy and institutional reforms in Bangladesh have been supported by the Bank through
a series o fbudget support operations, known as Development Support Credits (DSCs). As part o f
this series, four credits totaling US$900 million have been provided to Bangladesh since 2003;
the last credit, the Fourth Development Support Credit (DSC IV), was approved by the Board in
May 2007. These credits have supported Bangladesh's reform efforts to (a) strengthen core
governance functions with emphasis on reforms in public procurement, budget formulation and
execution, tax administration, and public administration; and (b) improve the investment climate
by maintaining macroeconomic                stability,  deepening domestic        deregulation and trade
liberalization, and strengthening performance o f the banking and energy sectors and o f state-
owned enterprises. To support the government's deepening o f reform efforts, the Bank has been
working with the CTG on a policy and institutional reform program that can be financed by a
Transitional Support Credit (TSC) as part o f its FY08 assistance program.'

6.        As the Bank was moving forward with the implementation o f its FY08 assistance
program, a devastating flood struck Bangladesh in the months o f July and August 2007. The
CTGs flood relief efforts are placing severe pressure on its FY08 budget, which in turn may
affect its development spending priorities and also adversely affect the macroeconomic situation.
Given that floods are not uncommon in this part o f the subcontinent, the government budget
always has a provision o f resources for such emergencies.               The amount budgeted for such
unforeseen circumstances in the FY08 budget (Tk 8 billion, or 0.2 percent o f GDP), however, i s
much smaller than the preliminary estimates o fthe damage caused by the floods. The real impact
o f floods will be known by end-September, when the monsoon season normally comes to an end.
The flood waters have not yet fully receded, and a committee led by the Planning Secretary i s
puttingtogether a preliminary need assessment for restoration andrehabilitation. Meanwhile, the
pressure on the budget related to immediatereliefactivities i s estimated to be inthe neighborhood
o fUS$l50 million, as reported by the Ministryo f Finance.


'    All political activities (including indoor politics) were prohibited from March 8, 2007, following the
     proclamation o f the current state o f emergency on January 11 t h ~ syear to quell political confrontation
*     over the January 22 abortive election.
      The World Bank Group's most recent Country Assistance Strategy, discussed by the Board inApril
      2006, aligns itself with the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy and has envisaged that a series o f
      Poverty Reduction Support Credits would be initiated in FY08 afier the new elected government had
      come to power. Because o f the changed political situation and inview o f the new schedule for holding
     parliamentary elections, it was decided that the Bank would support the country's ongoing reform
      efforts during the almost two-year transition period through a one-off budget support to the CTG inthe
      form o f a Transitional Support Credit.


                                                        2

7.       The proposed Supplemental Financing envisages reducing the pressure on the
government's FYO8 budget arising from the unforeseen flood related spending, which inturn will
allow it to continue moving forward on the policy and institutional reform agenda supported by
DSCs.


                    11. THE2007FLOODS: SOCIAL ANDECONOMIC                   IMPACT

8.       Bangladesh is one of the countries in the world most vulnerable to natural disasters
including floods, droughts, and cyclones. Eighty percent o f the country consists o f floodplains
created by more than 300 rivers and channels, including three major rivers: the Ganges, the
Brahmaputra, and the Meghna. The floodplains inBangladesh are home to a large rural and poor
population whose life i s intricately linked to the flooding regime. Regular annual flooding has
traditionally been beneficial to agriculture, the main source o f livelihood for the residents, but
severe floods occurring less frequently have had adverse impacts on residents and the economy.
Inthe lasttwo decades, major floods occurred in 1988, 1998, and2004.

A. Impact of Flood 2007: The Social and HumanDimensions

10.      Table 2 shows the extent o f flooding and associated damage so far in 2007 compared
with three previous major floods. The 2007 flood damage to date is less than that from the last
three major floods interms o f the number o fpeople affected, the proportiono f the area inundated,
damage to housing and infrastructure, and likely output losses, particularly inagriculture. Butthe
human death toll has been highrelative to the extent and duration o f the floods. As o f September
9, 2007, over 830 deaths have been officially reported, which may be an underestimate. It i s
important to recognize that all estimates for 2007 are preliminary and may change as better
information becomes available and the full impact o f the flood takes hold on the ground. Based
on the information currently available, some o f the critical social and human costs o f the flood are
described below:

  Health risks. Hunger and disease have become the order o f the day inthe affected areas. There
  i s an outbreak o f diarrhea in almost all the affected districts.    Filthy flood water spreading
  diseases across the flood-affected areas is compounding the misery. About 65,000 people have
  been affected by diarrhea and other water-borne diseases, particularly respiratory problems, skin
  diseases, and eye complications. There i s also a strong risk o f outbreak o f further ailments, as a
  result o f unsafe water and sanitary conditions created by the flood.

  Impact on water and sanitation. Groundwater extracted by hand pumps i s the main source o f
  drinkingwater inbothrural and urban areas. A majority o fhandpumps inthe 39 severely flood
  affected districts have gone under water. On the sanitation fi-ont, a majority o f latrines inaffected
  areas have reportedly been badly affected. The greatest worry i s the serious lack o f safe water
  supply, flooding o f latrines and the attendant spread o f pathogens in flood water, and a breakout
  o f water-borne disease.


0 Loss of livelihoods.      The human toll o f the floods goes well beyond the immediate health
  problems suffered by the victims. Several hundredthousand individuals have been displaced, and
  many thousands have lost their job or business. Although all flood victims are facing traumatic
  losses, certain groups are more vulnerable than others. Areas severely affected by the flood
  included some that were already among the poorer areas in the affected divisions. These include
  districts like Sunamgonj and Hobigonj inthe Sylhet division; Sirajgonj, Kurigram and Gaibandha
  districts in the Rajshahi division; and Jamalpur and Sherpur districts inthe Dhaka division, all o f
  which suffered serious losses. Those who were poor and vulnerable before the floods will be the
  most adversely affected by the loss o f livestock and other household assets. Loss o f livestock can
  also adversely affect access to credit and repayment o f existing loans, since livestock i s the
  collateral for most microfinance loans. The poor, who rely on labor as their primary asset, are
  also especially vulnerable to job losses in the self-employed, small, and micro enterprise sectors,
  which are in the informal sector with nojob security or access to insurance. The vulnerability o f
  the poor has been exacerbated by the fact that inflation in the country, particularly food inflation,
  has reached a nine-year high(more on this inthe next subsection).

  Loss of housing. The flood has washed away homes, and sometimes even the land the homes had
  been standing on as a result o f severe erosion. Many o f the affected people have taken shelter in



                                                    4

their relatives' homes or in schools, religious institutions, or other community buildings and flood
shelters. A majority o f the damaged homes meet minimal humanneeds and do not have in-house
water and sanitation facilities. There i s uncertainty regarding the estimate o f the number o f
heavily and partly damaged units, but the current estimate is around 1 million (see table 2). A
major problem i s the impact of floods on access to land for rebuilding homes. When land goes
under water, families need a new place to (re)build their homes, and the problem i s compounded
by the fact that many poor families have insecure tenure to the land on which their home was
built.

11.      A major flood, particularly in a flood-prone country like Bangladesh, can have a large
poverty impact in affected areas, some o f which were poorer than average even prior to the 2007
flood (as seen above). While these effects are especially strong in the immediate aftermath o f a
major flood, they may also persist inthe longer run-in terms o f higher poverty rate and greater
depth o f poverty in flood-prone areas. The longer-term effects on poverty occur because severe
shocks often compel the economically vulnerable to cope with their immediate needs through
measures like selling productive assets (e.g., livestock), accumulating high-interest loans, and
removing children fkom school-that        adversely affect their long-term economic potential. In
Bangladesh, there is evidence that while borrowing from informal sources protected the
consumption o f many during the 1998 floods, it also left a large number o f the poor highly
indebted, which negatively affected their ability to access future loans for income generation.'
Effective social protection programs (like cash grants) that address the immediate needs o f the
vulnerable are important to mitigate the likely long-term poverty impact o fthe 2007 flood.

B.ImpactofFlood 2007: TheEconomic Dimensions

12.      Past experience suggests that floods tend to: (a) reduce GDP growth, in particular by
dampening growth in agnculture, construction, small-scale manufacturing, and transport and
communication; (b) increase inflation, particularly by increasing food prices as a result o f supply
shock and disruptions in transportation; (c) reduce export growth, increase remittances and
imports (the latter resulting from the emergency need for food and items needed for
reconstruction); and (d) increase fiscal deficits by depressing revenue growth and increasing
unforeseen expenditures. Past experience also shows that these adverse effects are temporary.
The Bangladesh economy has time and again proved its resilience inrecovering from the effects
o f natural disasters inreasonably quick time.

13.      Before the 2007 floods, the Bangladesh economy was poised to grow in the range o f 6.5
to 7 percent in FY08, propelled by a recovery in agriculture after a weak performance last year,
robust manufacturing growth, and services growing at the usual trend growth rate. Buoyant
garment exports and remittance flows as well as the possibility o f higher aid and private flows
were expected to sustain investment, including inpower infrastructure. The year also began with
a comfortable foreign exchange reserve position o f more than US$5 billion (equivalent to 3.2
months o f imports o f goods and nonfactor services). Amidst the positive economic environment
and optimism about the immediate future, one concern was inflation, which had been aggravated
by rising prices o f essential food items such as rice, wheat, edible oil, and fish. The following
paragraphs summarize the movement o f key economic variables and how they have been affected
bythe ongoing floods and the policy stance adoptedbythe CTGto respondto the movements.




     For recent evidence on Bangladesh, see Dasgupta, A. (2007), "Floods and Poverty Traps: Evidence
     fromBangladesh." Economic &Political Weekly, July 28.


                                                  5

14.     Inflation. Increasing both in rural and urban areas, inflation has accelerated to 9.2
percent (annual point-to-point) inJune, which i s anine-year high. Food inflation, which accounts
for 58.8 percent o f the Consumer Price Index in Bangladesh, surged to 9.8 percent and nonfood
inflation to 8.3 percent. This surge in inflation obviously preceded the onset of the flood, and i s
attributable mainly to international price increases and growth in domestic demand. There are
signs that floods have made it worse with inflation soaring further to 10.1 percent in July-the
last month for which data are availablehven entirely by food inflation, which increased to
11.4 percent. Non-food inflation decreasedslightly to 8.2 percent.

15.     The damage to crops and transport infrastructure causedby the ongoing floods i s likely to
exacerbate the situation by increasing supply-side inflationary pressures. Moreover, prices of
essential food items generally increase during the month of Ramadan, which this year starts on
September 14. Thus, inall likelihood, inflation couldrise further inthe next couple of months.

16.      Incases where monetary managementis prudent, inflation producedby a supply shock
typically subsides after some lag. This was evident for the 1998 post flood inflation, which rose
from 7 percent inJuly, 1998 to 13 percent inDecember 1998, declined to 8 percent by June 1999,
and to 3 percent by December 1999. The 1998 inflation could be characterized as a pure supply-
shock inflation that literally cured itself as a result of a bumper Boro harvest in Spring 1999.
Inflationary pressures were kept in check by prudent monetary management during this period,
with money supply growthaveraging 9-10 percent duringFY98-2000.

17.      Defininghighfood prices as one of the main economic problems facing the country that
most affects the poor; the CTG has taken a number o f steps to tackle the problem. More
specifically, it has

         Loweredimport duty on essential items-rice,     wheat, edibleoil, and onion-to  zero
         Established numerous fair price shops (in both rural and urban areas operated by
        BangladeshRifles) and toll-free markets; imported food through a number o f government
         agencies.
         Encouraged private commercialbanks to lower Letter o f Credit margins for food imports
         Decidedto impose zero duty on itemsinhighdemand duringthe montho fRamadan
         Decidedto supply seeds and fertilizer inthe post flood period in a timely manner and in
         adequatequantity
         Decidedto import 350,000 metric tons of rice and 200,000 metric tons o f wheat on an
         emergency basis.
         Interest rate on import of essential items loweredtemporarily.


        Monetary growth declined to 17 percent in June this year, compared to 22.3 percent in
December 2006, reflecting primarily sharp declines in credit to the private sector and central
government. Growtho f credit to the private sector declined from 19.4 percent inDecember 2006
to 14 percent inJune 2007, while growth of credit to the central government declined from 35.9
percent to 12.7 percent during the same period. This decline did not necessarily constitute a
deliberate tightening o f monetary policy, but perhaps reflected a slowdown ineconomic activities
in the first half of 2007. While supply shocks, particularly international commodity price
increases, have played an important role in the upsurge o f inflation, the persistently highrate of
monetary growth (hovering around 20 percent) since February 2006 accommodated the supply
shocks, leading to their persistent impact on inflation.       However, in its Monetary Policy



                                                  6

Statement released on July 12, 2007, Bangladesh Bank announced its commitment to a cautious
monetary stance in the second half o f 2007, including review o f Cash Reserve Requirements
(CRR), Statutory LiquidityRequirements (SLR), and policy interest rates.

19.     Economic growth and employment. Inthe past couple o f months there have been some
signs-mostly    anecdotal-that   private sector business confidence has suffered in the country,6
which in turn, may have some impact on the FY08 economic growth rate. The floods may
aggravate this ~ituation.~ Inthe immediate aftermath of the flood, its adverse impact is likely to
occur inthe following sectors:

   Agriculturalproduction. Preliminary estimates by the Department o f Agricultural Extension
    suggest that crops worth between Tk 18 to 20 billion (US$250 to 300 million) have been
    damagedby the ongoing floods. The damagedcrops include rice, jute, vegetables, and spices
    on around 469,000 hectares o f land constituting about 26 percent o f the total cultivated crops
    inthe affected areas. Aman hasbeenthe worst hit4amage to 250,000 hectareshascauseda
    loss of an estimated Tk 10billion (roughly US$140 million).

    Livestock andfisheries. This sub sector has suffered damage worth Tk 150 million (US$2.35
    million).   According to the initial estimates provided by the Ministry of Fisheries and
    Livestock, some 32,620 metric tons of fish, 583 metric tons o f shrimp, and 462.2 million fry
    were washed away as 186,307 ponds and large water bodies across the country were
    submerged by floodwaters.       These figures, however, reflect losses in fisheries only and
    exclude losses inother types of livestock (chicken, goats, among others, commonly ownedby
    Bangladeshi households) that are likely to be considerable.

    Flood control and irrigation infrastructure. Extensive damage has been caused to the flood
    embankment and regulators of the BangladeshWater Development Board (BWDB)-managed
    water schemes, and irrigation infrastructure managedby the BWDB, Bangladesh Agncultural
    Development Corporation (BADC) and Local Government Engineering Department (LGED)
    in most of the 39 flood-affected districts.       This may have indirect adverse effects on
    agncultural production.

    Manufacturing. The small-scale manufacturing sector appears to be the most seriously hit,
    particularly the textile industry concentrated in the Sirajgonj and Pabna districts, causing
    losses of more than Tk 1.5 billion (about $22 million) and renderingmore than 800,000 loom
    workers jobless. At least 40,000 handloom and powerloom units out of more than 53,000
    have been submerged, damaging looms, stock o f raw materials, and finished goods and
    disrupting production activities completely. About 50 to 70 thousand weavers have been
    directly affected, and all the 0.8 million weavers are financially vulnerable. Bangladesh
    Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) industrial estates in some areas are also
    likely to havebeen affected.




    One possible reason for k s could be the vigorous pursuit o f the anticorruption drive launched by the
    CTG. Many questions are being asked by tax officials and the banks intheir dealings with the private
    sector. On its part, the CTG has publicly assured that it is taking steps to check any unnecessary
    harassment to the business community.
7   Although experience has shown that the impact o f floods on growth tends to be temporary and the
    economy's normal growth momentum revives as the flood recedes, reform efforts continue, and the
    investment climate improves.


                                                   7

     Transport and Communication.         Road transport infrastructure appears to have suffered
    extensive localized damage in most o f the 39 flood-affected districts. Damage has been
    caused to the primary roads network managed by the Roads and Highways Department and to
    the secondary roads network managed by the LGED. Damage is particularly severe where
    incidents o f flash flooding led to wave action and the erosion o f embankments.          Inland
    waterways and airports are only marginally affected, as i s typically the case.

20.      Balance ofPayments. The overall impact o f the floods on balance o f payment (BOP)
position i s likely to be marginal. Export growth inFY07 slowed to 15.7 percent, compared with
21.6 percent in FY06. Import growth was also fairly strong at 16.4 percent. Combined with a
strong 24.5 percent remittance growth, the external current account balance inFY07 had a surplus
equivalent to 0.5 percent o f GDP, the same as in FY06. Floods could affect exports somewhat,
particularly exports o f frozen food. In addition to emergency food imports (including a recent
decision by the government to import 350,000 tons o f rice and 200,000 tons o f wheat to add to its
foodgrain stock), post flood relief and rehabilitation is likely to require the import o f selected
products, particularly some construction materials. Aided food imports are also likely to be
higher than they otherwise would have been inthe absence o f floods. On the other hand, a fall in
real income growth could depress import demand. Historically, however, import growth in dollar
terms has tended to increase inthe aftermath o f floods. This, together with some adverse effects
on exports, may result ina bit larger narrowing o f the current account surplus thanexpected at the
onset o f FYOX. Fortunately, this year Bangladesh has a foreign exchange reserve level o f over
US$5 billion (equivalent to 3.4 months o f GNFS imports), compared to pre flood levels o f
US$3.1 billion (2.8 months) in 2004 and US$1.8 billion (2.8 months) in 1998. This, together
with the floating exchange rate regime, will help absorb the pressure arising from the
deterioration in the trade balance resulting from emergency import o f food, agricultural inputs,
and construction materials.

21.      Fiscal Variables. The fiscal impact o f the floods i s likely to be significant. The relief
effort, expansion in food-assisted safety nets, repairs to public property, and the impact o f the
flood on economic growth are likely to putpressure on both the revenue and expenditure sides o f
the budget.

22.      Inthe first half of 2007, the government had taken several initiatives to improve fiscal
management.       It launched a dnve to collect taxes, which resulted in income tax collection
exceeding the FY07 original budget target, and significantly cut back development spending to
remain within the budgeted deficit. In April, it made large adjustments in petroleum prices,
which helped contain growing quasi fiscal losses. The floods may, however, reverse the positive
impact o f these fiscal measures.

23.      Past experience shows that current expenditures tend to rise significantly inthe aftermath
o f a flood. The FY08 target for food distribution through the Public Food Distribution System i s
1.67 million metric tons, which may need to be revised upward to take into account additional
flood relief needs. The government will have to help the flood-affected farmers commence
production. The most immediate need would be to replant rice for the winter crops under the
transplantedAman rice cultivation program, for which the farmers will need seeds, fertilizer, farm
machines, and fuel. The government will also need to ensure that adequate supplies o f seeds o f
maize, pulses, wheat, vegetables, and Boro are available. The farmers will also need assistance
with the health o f their cattle, since the survivingcattle inthe affected areas are likely to suffer
from malnutrition and diseases. Other costs likely to increase current expenditures include the
need to provide assistance to the small-scale manufacturing sector for rehabilitation, grants to




                                                   8

dislocated people, and other increased operations and maintenance (O&M) expenditures to repair
infrastructure damage.

24.       Given these multidimensional needs, revenue expenditure may overshoot the original
FY08 budget target despite the provisions that exist in the FY08 Revenue Budget and the Food
Account. These include Tk 8 billion for unforeseen expenditures and Tk 6.2 billion for programs
funded from the Revenue Budget. There i s also Tk 17.5 billion provision as VGF, GR and other
relief activities in the Revenue Budget and Tk 4.1 billion for non-ADP FFW. However, the
unforeseen flood expenditures can only be managed in part from these provisions as well as
expenditure restructuring. Moreover, the immediate cash financing needs (for emergency food,
seeds, and fertilizer imports) cannot be met entirely from own resources, since only a limited
amount o f resources can be freed up right away by restructuringother expenditures.

25.       It should be possible to redirect expenditures from the Annual Development Plan (ADP),
which is the capital expenditure budget, toward the repair o f damaged infrastructure. Floods tend
to reduce ADP implementation shortfall by augmenting demand for fast-disbursing expenditures.
Considering this, and assuming that the government will achieve significant reallocation o f ADP
funds to finance nonfood imports and repair damage to public assets, it i s reasonable to assume
that the actual ADP expenditures can still be contained within the FYO8 budget target o f Tk 265
billion. Implementation shortfall last year, an unusual year, was 17 percent, whereas normally it
tends to be within the 10-15 percent range relative to the original budget target. The CTG is
taking measures to reduce the normal implementation shortfall, which, together with the impact
o f floods, may bring it down to less than 10 percent. The Planning Commission is currently in
the process identifying potentials for pruningthe FY08 ADP and this exercise i s expected to be
completedby end-September.

26.       Thus, the challenge of containing the FY08 budget deficit within the original target has
become all the more formidable. Historically, growth inrevenue collection declines in the flood
year in particular. Combined with expenditure increases, this could lead to the FY08 budget
deficit overshooting the pre flood 3.6 percent projection.8 This would be bearable if it i s
accompanied by an increase in concessionary external financing. Otherwise, there would be
pressure on domestic financing, particularly financing from the bankmg system, and especially
the Bangladesh Bank. The ongoing flood relief efforts o f the government have been mostly
financed by borrowing from the banking system, which has significantly increased in July 2007.
Concessionary external financing will also mitigate any worsening o f BOP position that may
result from emergency import needs for rice and other items.


                                111.RESPONSE TOTHE 2007FLOODS

27.       Bangladesh has in the past experienced natural disasters, including floods, and has built
up a response system that has improved over time. The government budget includes disaster
response lines items that include cash grants that are distributed through a combination o f local
governments and community targeting.           The effectiveness o f the flood response system in
Bangladesh has been evaluated inseveral internationalstudies and found to be effe~tive.~

28.     Responding to the 2007 floods, the CTG has already taken measures to distribute relief
materials and help the affected people. Its flood assistance strategy is being implemented by the
National Disaster Management Committee in close cooperation with the Inter-ministerial
Coordination Committee.. Moreover, coordination committees have been formed at the district
and upazila levels with representatives from the government, private organizations, and NGOs,
and havenow started functioning. Key actions taken by the CTGto tackle the floods include:

    Authorization to eight line ministries to carv outflood emergency work using their regular
    maintenance budget. The total amount authorized for flood related work is Tk 21 billion
    (roughly US$300 million). This accounts for 81.8 percent o f the total FY08 nonwage O&M
    budget, which means that most o f the regular maintenance will have to be deferred to FY09
    unless the amount reallocated from nonwage O&M is restored this year.

    The decision to import 350,000 tons of rice and 200,000 tons of wheat to augment its food
    grain stock. Ina meeting on August 16, 2007, the Advisers Committee on Purchase decided
    to procure another 100,000 tonnes o f rice from local importers to further supplement the
    government's rice stock. The estimated cost o f both imports and local procurement i s Tk
    1.23 billion (about US$18 million).

    The decision to launch an open market sale (OMS) of ricefrom September 9, 2007,for one
    month in order to keep rice prices tolerable during theforthcoming Ramadan. Under this
    program, 118,000 tons o f rice will be sanctioned to 15,440 dealers, each distributing 510 kg.
    The government also plans to import 650,000 tons o f urea this year, o f which 312,000 tons
    have already been imported.

    Housing and livelihood support through direct cash transfers toflood victims. On August 25,
    2007, the CTG allocated Tk. 320 million (about $5 million) from the Chief Adviser's Relief
    and Welfare Fund for an immediate cash transfer to the flood victims to help repair damaged
    homes. These will be distributed through the local administration after assessing actual
    damage or losses caused by the floods. Each family will get Tk 10,000 if their house i s
    completely damaged and Tk 5,000 if partly damaged. The government i s also considering
    providing a one-time relief cash grant for livelihood support to flood victims, the details o f
    which-including      the amount o f assistance, the institutional arrangements for delivery, and
    the criteria for eligibility-are yet to be decided. It i s important to recognize that, over time,
    Bangladesh has increasingly employed cash transfer programs as a means to assure food
    security+specially      during periods o f natural disasters-and    this policy has generally been
    successful.10

    Assuring availability of Aman seedlings in the affected areas. The government has initiated a
    Tk 650 million (about $ 9.5 million) post flood program to rehabilitate about 700,000 small
    and marginal farmers inthe affected districts and has already allocated Tk 300 million. Late
    variety Aman rice seedlings and seeds for dry season crops are to be distributed among the
    farmers under this program.

29.     The focus at the moment i s on relief and the immediate rehabilitation needs o f flood
victims inareas where flood water has receded, which includes social protection to help displaced
persons and other vulnerable groups return to productive lives as soon as possible. A full damage

lo  A recent World Bank studyo fthe effectiveness o fcash transfer programs inBangladesh found these to
    be quite successful and cost-effective in reaching the needy. See World Bank, (2006) Safety Nets in
    Bangladesh.

assessment i s only possible after the flood waters recede completely. The possibility of severe
flooding for a second time has become very real in recent days as 23 districts have been
inundated till September 9 with water levels in all major rivers rising and continuing to flow
above danger mark. Once these exigencies and uncertainties are resolved the CTG will be in a
position to prepare a medium-to long-term flood recoveryprogram, which i s expected to include
additional social programs, support to affected farmers and enterprises, and a medium-term
reconstruction and disaster mitigation program. Meanwhile, the CTG has requested the World
Bank's assistanceto help meet these and other emergency flood-related expenditures.

A. Government Spendingon Floods

30.      The government has so far incurred about Tk 22 billion (roughly US$ 324 million, about
one-fourth of which will be covered by supplemental IDA funds) expenditures on account of
floods (see table 3). These expenditures have been financed from provisions for nonwage O&M
and various block allocations in the revenue budget. The flood-related expenditure incurred to
date constitutes 3.4 percent of the total FY08 expenditure budget. Restoration and rehabilitation
activities account for nearly 94 percent of the total and relief for the rest. Food import and
budgetary support to agncultural credit account for the bulk o f the rehabilitation expenditures.
Actual cash transfers for housing through the Ministry o f Food and Disaster Management
amounted to Tk 625 million (UStS9.l million). Food supplied through the various safety net

programs of the Government (Vulnerable Group Feeding and Food for Works) constitutes the
largest relief expenditure. Emergency cash grants for relief amounted to Tk 466.5 million
(US$6.8 million).

B. Responseof Other Stakeholders

31.     Some of the NGOs have also started providing relief support to the affected people.
International organizations based in Dhaka are having similar coordination meetings facilitated
byUNDP. As initialresponse, DFID,CIDA, USAID,Norway, Germany, UNICEF, WHO, WFP,
UNFPA, and UNDP have already offered financial assistanceand some have started to mobilize
relief materials. A US$50 million emergency commodity grant from Saudi Arabia has started
arriving. While the government didnot directly appeal for foreign assistanceinhis address to the
nation on August 5, 2007, the Chief Adviser mentioned that the government will "cordially
accept spontaneoushelp and assistancefrom development partners at home and abroad."

32.     DFID is still focusing on the immediate relief as well as considering the support
requested by UNDP, which i s worhng on a short-term recovery and rehabilitation plan for UN
interventions. UNCentral EmergencyFundhas allocated US$ 6 million towards flood relief. At
the same time, DFIDi s looking at the opportunities within its programs for redirectingthe already

committed resources for flood purposes.       ADB and Japan are exploring ways o f providing
support.


                      IV.BANK'S2007FLOOD            ASSISTANCE    STRATEGY

33.     The Bank i s regularly monitoring the flood situation and conferring with the government,
other development partners, and UNagencies about the emergency response. Since the onset o f
floods this season, the Bank has been preparing a biweekly "Flood Situation Update" for its
Senior Management. As a part o f the Bank's role in coordinating development partners, the
Bank`s Country Director co-chaired (with the Secretary of the Economic Relations Division,
Ministry of Finance) a Local Consultative Group Plenary on August 19 to discuss the flood
situation with government officials. At this meeting, the Finance Secretary indicated that the
government would need US$150 million o f additional budgetary support to meet flood-related
expenses based on the flood situationat the present time.

34.     The Bank has designed an interim flood assistance strategy to help the country cope with
the situation, with the understanding that the floods are not yet over this year. Learning from its
experience o f a similar flood situation in 2OOLthough the magnitude o f damage was much
higher then-the   Bank`s financial assistance strategy has the following two elements:

0   Budget Support: A quick-disbursingUS$ 75 million budget support operation to reduce (a)
    the fiscal pressure on the government that is arising out o f non-programmed flood-related
    spending; and (b) any unforeseen pressure on the foreign exchange reserves that may be
    arising as a result o f emergency imports, particularly those related to food. This quick-
    disbursing fiscal support i s to be funded from the FY08 IDA allocation to Bangladesh. This
    component i s the proposed Supplemental Financing to the recently approved Fourth
    Development Support Credit. These resources, among other things, will restore a part o f the
    regular nonwage operation and maintenance budget o f several line ministries that i s being
    used for flood-related restoration and rehabilitation activities.         Most of the regular
    maintenance work programmed for this year will suffer if this i s not done, with adverse
    developmental consequences particularly for the roads, public works, education, and health
    sectors.


0   Restoration and Rehabilitation: A list o f restoration and rehabilitation activities associated
    with the floods is planned to be financed from reallocatingresources from the existing Bank
    projects that face imminent cancellations and/or have disaster management components built
    into their design.   Immediate post flood rehabilitation o f infiastructure will address some
    urgent connectivity needs that will need to be carried out over a longer period o f time.
    Existing project funds will be redirected to provide support in agriculture, health,
    communications, and water and sanitation. This part of the strategy will be based on a post-
    flood assessment that will be undertaken after September, once the floods are over.          A
    separate program to support these activities will be designed once a needs assessment has
    been put together. In the event this requires formal project restructurings, or a new credit,
    Board approval will be sought. As mentioned earlier, the Ministry o f Planning i s engaged in
    a needs assessment exercise and its report i s likely to be available by end-September.

    The ongoing multidonor Health Nutrition Population Sector Program, which i s supported by
    a large group of donors some o f who have pooled their resources in a multi donor trust fund
    managed by the Bank, has a component for financing emergencies and disasters-roughly
    US$10 million over five years. Priority health supplies and operations related to the floods



                                                 13

    including drugs, water purification tablets, and costs for mobilizing relief teams, are being
    financed through this program. The World Bank received a request from the Health Ministry
    to approve emergency supplies worth US$l.57 million, which has been already approved.
    The Bank has also allowed for national /international shopping to speed up delivery o f the
    commodities.

35.      This strategy has been discussed with the CTG and has its endorsement. The strategy
was also discussed with key development partners and fits into the overall plan for external
assistance for flood recovery.

         v. THEREFORMPROGRAMSUPPORTEDTHROUGHDSCIv:AN UPDATE
36.      The Development Support Credit (DSC) series" has supported Bangladesh's reform
efforts along two pillars: (a) strengthening core governancefunctions, with emphasis on reforms
inpublic procurement, budget formulation and budget execution, tax administration, and public
administration; and (b) improving the investment climate, by maintaining macroeconomic
stability, deepening domestic deregulation and trade liberalization,             and strengthening
performance o f the banking and energy sectors and o f state-owned enterprises.

37.      The DSC IV program was closely aligned with the reform pillars outlined in the GOB'S
Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) that was presented to the boards o f the International
Development Agency (IDA) and the InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) inearly 2006. The PRS
stresses the links among investment growth, job creation, and poverty reduction. It identifies key
areas where reforms are needed, public investments are required, and public policies merit
improvement.      To generate broad-based growth and reduce poverty, the PRS focuses on
employment generation, nutrition, maternal health, quality o f education, safe water and sanitation,
the criminal justice system, and local governance. It acknowledges that progress in these areas
requires creating an open and competitive environment conducive to private sector development.
Other priority areas outlined in the PRS include: improving the ability o f poor people to
participate fully inthe growth process through access to nutrition, better quality education, health,
water, and sanitation; and ensuring that governance issues are addressed by, among others,
tackling corruption, enhancing access to justice for the poor, and improving security and public
order.

38.      A description o f the reform efforts-past,    ongoing and needed in the future-that
underpinthe country's development vision i s provided inthe DSC IV document.12 The following
paragraphs provide a briefing o f the country's economic and social performances as well as an
update on the reforms since the approval o f DSC IVby the Board inMay 2007.

A. EconomicPerformance

39.      Bangladesh's economic performance has been fairly impressive in recent years. The
economy grew by 6.6 percent in FY06, the highest rate in over two decades, and despite
prolonged political turmoil growth was 6.5 percent in FY07, the fourth consecutive year o f at
least 6 percent growth (table 5). Growthhas been broad-based, cutting across all major economic

    new PRGFarrangement.

sectors and benefiting from robust demand in both domestic and export markets.                    The
manufacturing sector grew at an impressive 11.4 percent in FY07, its strongest performance in
over a decade. Garment exports, which account for about 75 percent o f manufacturing exports,
grew by 11.6 percent (innominal dollar terms) inFY07. This was despite enhancedcompetition
from other low-cost producers after the dismantling o f the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing
(ATC) on January 1, 2005, and disruption o f normal economic life for more than two months
because of intensepolitical turmoil. Construction, fueledby strong manufacturing growth as well
as large amounts of remittance inflows, grew by an estimated 7.1 percent, maintaining its 7-8
percent growth record since FY94. Remittances through formal channels were recorded at nearly
US$6 billion, which is about 9 percent of GDP and half o f merchandize exports (gross),
compared with US$l.9 billion inFYO1.

40.       Macroeconomic stability has been broadly maintained (table 5). The fiscal, monetary,
and external indicators have remained mostly within the thresholds of the macroeconomic
framework agreed with the IMF under the PRGF program, although there have been some
temporary deviations. One key indicator-revenue         mobilization-has   persistently fallen short of
its targets. InFY08, the government borrowed Tk 5.33 (net) billion from the banlung system till
August 16, 2007, against the FY08 target ofTk 79.8 billion. The government is also planningto
take some austerity measures, including cutting entertainment allowance and transportation costs
and delaying implementation o f low-priority ADP projects.           As mentioned earlier, inflation
continues to be a problem with prices showing an upward trend. While part of this i s due to
rising food prices (which has been aggravated by the floods), non-food inflation has also been
rising. In the past several months, the Bangladesh Bank has not effectively used the monetary
policy instrument to tackle the non-food or structural part o f inflation.

B. Poverty and Social Impact Analysis

41.      As mentioned earlier, Bangladesh has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty
over the last 15 years. Inearly 199Os, close to 60 percent o f the population was living inpoverty,
which declined to 49 percent in 2000 and 40 percent by 2005. The 1.8 percentage point annual
decline in the poverty rate from 2000 to 2005 was a significant improvement over the 1
percentage point annual decline during the 1990s. The fall in poverty rate was in fact large
enough to significantly reduce the number o f people in poverty (with a growing population) by
nearly 6 million people between 2000 and 2005. The reduction inpoverty i s attributable mainly
to a 3.3 percent annual average growth in real GDP per capita during 2000-05, which translated
into significant poverty reduction because o f almost no increase in inequality-the    Gini index of
consumption remained stable at around 0.3 1 since 1996. Between 2000 and 2005, consumption
growth was equitable across the distribution, and in fact slightly higher than the national average
for the bottom 30 percent o f the population. Improvements in quality of life between 2000 and
2005 were not limited to consumption, but were also seen for a variety o f indicators, including
housingconditions, access to electricity, sanitation, and telephone connections.

42.      Ifthe current trends ingrowth andinequality were to continue, Bangladeshwill meet its
MDG o f reducing the poverty rate by half from 1990 to 2015, that is, 29 percent by 2015.
Progress has also been good toward several other MDGs.Bangladesh i s on track to meet its MDG
on gender parity, having already achieved the goal in primary and secondary schooling.
Significant gains have also been achieved inreducing child mortality. The under-five mortality
rate has fallen from 136 deaths per 1,000 live birthsin 1990 to 66 today. This rate i s considerably
lower than inneighboring India, even though Bangladesh's per capita GDP i s about half the size
o f India's. Attaining the MDGs relating to child malnutrition and those in education relating to
universal net primary enrollment andprimary completion remains challenging but within reach.
Bangladesh had also nearly achieved the safe water MDG, with 97 percent o f its population
having access to pathogen-free water, before arsenic contamination posed a new round o f
 challenge^.'^

43.      Analysis o f poverty reduction suggests that a lot of the economic gains during 2000-05
among households took place as a result o f improving returns to their endowments, in other
words as a result o f higher incomes generated from available assets and occupations, which in
turn indicate the beneficial impact o f economic growth. Poverty reduction is linked to wage and
productivity increase in the industry sector, along with substantial employment growth in the
service sector; increased inflow o fremittances i s also likely to have played an important role.

44.      Substantial challenges, however, still remain. Around 56 million Bangladeshis remained
inpoverty in 2005. Disaggregated poverty trends show that regions in the west and southwest
(Rajshahi, Barisal, and Khulna divisions) have fallen significantly behind the east (Dhaka,
Chittagong, and Sylhet divisions).      Dhaka and Chittagong contributed nearly 80 percent o f
national poverty reduction between 2000 and 2005, with just over half the population, while
Khulna and Barisal had no contribution, with about one-fifth o f the population.             Lack o f
economic growth in the lagging regions i s related to a number o f factors, including poor
connectivity to the main growth centers o f the country (most importantly, Dhaka), inadequate

     Bangladesh," Washington, D.C.

infrastructure, and lower inflow o f remittances. Closing this regional economic divide would be
an important area o f focus for public policy, as the CTG has recently indicated publicly on
repeated occasions.

45.     Poverty estimates since 2005 are not available and must await the next Household
Income and Expenditure Survey (2008-09). While economic growth has been strong during the
last two years and i s likely to have reduced poverty further below the 2005 level, there i s some
cause for concern with regardto the recent spike ininflation (see Section 1I)that may have had an
adverse short-term impact on poverty. As mentioned earlier, not only i s the flood likely to
exacerbate the poverty situation in the short term in the affected areas, these effects can also
persist to some extent in the longer run-in terms o f higher poverty rate and greater depth o f
poverty inflood prone areas.

C. ReformProgress since the Approval of DSCIV

46.      The progress made as part o f the DSC N-supported initiatives in strengthening the
banking sector, liberalizing the trade regime, strengthening o f tax administration, and reforms to
improve the functioning o f core governance institutions has been encouraging. Appropriately
under the current conditions, and also consistent with the emphasis in the poverty reduction
strategy, the CTG has accorded its highest priority to maintaining essential law and order
conditions and strengthening key institutions o f accountability.         The CTG also remains
committed to deepening reforms in public expenditure and financial management, public
procurement, tax administration, economic deregulation, public administration, state-owned
enterprises, banlung, trade, and power.

47.      The following paragraphs provide updates onreformprogress by specific areas:

(i)MacroeconomicStability

    Withthe implementationo feconomic reforms envisaged inthe PRS, growth is expectedto be
    sustained at around 6.5 to 7 percent over the medium term, with the industrial sector
    continuing to be the main driver. While the impact o f the flood on economic sectors, as
    discussed in Section 11, i s likely to reduce current year growth (by possibly 0.2 to 0.3
    percentage point relative to the pre flood projection of 7 percent), the growth in subsequent
    years i s likely to be minimally affected, as similar natural disasters in Bangladesh and other
    countries have shown. The strength o f the external sector should sustain double-digit export
    growth, with firming growth prospects inthe key European market inFY08.
    Highand rising inflation is the main concern on the macro front, particularly inview o f the
    continued unfavorable international price developments. The flood i s likely to increase the
    inflationary pressure, particularly because o f its disruption to food production and
    transportation, but these effects are likely to be temporary with prudent monetary
    management. With the corrective measures taken by the government to smooth the flow of
    food supply and the commitment by the Bangladesh Bank to take a cautious monetary stance
    inthe second half of 2007, the pressure on consumer prices should ease somewhat after the
    flood induced shocks peter out. Of course this depends upon no further sharp and continued
    rise in global commodity prices, oil in particular, and no reversal of the decline in monetary
    growth since December 2006.

(ii) CorporatizatioflrivatizationofNationalCommercialBanks(NCBs)
   Banking:


0   The three new banlung companies have already been formed and given commercial banking
    licenses by the Bangladesh Bank. The technical part o f the corporatization process has been
    completed and the Vendor's Agreements to transfeddivest the entire assets, liabilities and
    capital o f the NCBs to the new banks i s expected to be signed soon. The new banlung
    companies will start operating as soon as the Finance Division issues a GazetteNotification.
    The government has already issued a Letter o f Intent (LOI) and formally invited the preferred
    bidder to take over the 93 percent stake of the largely state-owned Rupali Bank Limited
    (RBL) for US$458 million. It has also taken all necessary initiatives to resolve the major
    disputes hindering the formal sale/transfer o f RBL. However, it still awaits a concrete
    positive response from the prospective buyer for signing o f the Sales and Purchase
    Agreement (SPA).

(iii)State-OwnedEnterprises:Restructuring

    BIMANBangladeshAirlines became a Public Limited Company on July 23,2007, as part o f
    the government's effort to rescue the loss-making national carrier. An international operator
    will be appointed through public tender biddingto runthe new airline. The government will
    retain 100 percent share for the time being, gradually offloading up to 49 percent o f the
    shares o fthe airline to the private sector. The first board o f directors o f the company has been
    formed with six government officials headed by the Cabinet secretary and the present
    BIMANManaging Director as its Chief Executive Officer. The airline has recentlyreleased
     1876 personnel through a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS), reducing its workforce by
    about 44 percent. BIMANhas also undertaken a number o f short-term reform actions such as
    closing down some loss-malung internationaland domestic routes.

0   The government has closed four loss-malung jute mills in July-one in Khulna, one in
    Sirajgonj, and two in Chittagong.        It has also started clearing arrear payments to the
    retrenched jute mill workers as part o f the Social Protection Package for Retrenched SOE
    workers.


(iv) Power Sector

    The least-cost generation development plan has been adopted though its implementation
    continues to lag behind. Work i s also underway on a generation financing strategy, which i s
    designed to integrate least-cost selection of projects within an overall public and private
    financing framework. This plan i s expected to be finalized byNovember 2007.
    The government has appointed Transaction Advisors for three large base-load power plants.
    The Transaction Advisor for Bibyana 450 MW Independent Power producer (IPP) has held
    road shows in Dhaka, Dubai, and Singapore. Prequalification documents for this IPP are
    expected to be issued in September 2007.
    Six sponsors have been selected, through a transparent and competitive process, to install
    about 200 MW of small power plants, which range between l O M W and 30 MW.
    The government has adopted the Financial Restructuring Plan, in principle, and has further
    agreed to start restructure the balance sheets o f all power utilities.              Implementation
    Consultants to restructure the balance sheets will be appointed by October 2007. Provision o f
    Tk 6 billion has been made in the FY08 budget to provide financial support to the power


                                                  18

    sector as its current tariff i s below cost.    Arrears from government and private sector
    consumers have beenreduced.
    Notwithstanding the desirability o f adjustment, it is unlikely that electricity tariff could be
    increased inthe next couple o f months, particularly inview o f the existing inflation situation
    inthe country. A small upwardrevision inthe tariff rates was implemented by the CTG in
    March2007.

(v) Trade andTax Administration

    Average nominal protection was reduced by 2.4 percentage points inthe FY08 budget, from
    24.3 percent to 21.9 percent. The tariff structure was simplified by collapsing one para-tariff
    (Infrastructural Development Surcharge), with customs duty, eliminating most zero tariffs,
    and recasting tariff slabs.
    The government has initiated the separation o f tax policy work and from tax administration
    work, and has agreed to review the VAT and Income Tax legislations as part o f simplifying
    i t s tax system.
    The government i s consolidatingthe key functions o f Human Resources, ICT, and Audit
    under a single member or Chairman o f the National Boardo f Revenue.

(vi) PublicFinancialManagement andProcurement

    The government and six development partners have agreed to a public financial management
    (PFM) reform program in consultation with the government. An Identification Mission
    Report has been prepared as a basis for designing the next steps o f the PFMreformprogram,
    which i s to be effective no later than October 2008.
    An appropriate legal framework providing the C&AG more financial and administrative
    authority i s being initiated.
    The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) strengthening project was approved and became
    effective from July 2007. The government has initiated establishing an Ad-hoc PAC while
    PAC i s inabeyance, as an interim mechanism to continue the work o fthe defunct PAC.
    The government has formed four independent procurement review panels, as per the
    provisions o f the public procurement regulations; the panels are functioning reasonably well.
    The panels, as o f July 2007, handled 15 cases, and the government acted in conformity with
    the views and decisions o f the panels inall but three cases.
    Transparency of the system i s improving further with the beginning o f posting procurement
    performance data inthe Web site o f Central Procurement Technical Unit (CPTU). The Rural
    Electrification Board and LGED were selected for this purpose. For these two organizations
    an initial annual report for FY06, instead o f quarterly as planned, has been posted inCPTU's
    website for contracts valued at Tk. 10million and above.
    Based on the newly passed Procurement Act, the government has finalized the rules, and after
    endorsement o f the Finance Adviser, it i s now waiting for placement to the Ministry o f Law
    for final approval. The act will become effective as soon as the rules are gazetted after
    Ministryo f Law's approval. The processhas been delayed by a few months, butthe reform
    agenda i s on track.




                                                 19

(vii) Governanceand Anticorruption

    All o f the legal processes for separating the judiciary from the executive have been
    completed. The related administrative requirements, including the creation o f and
    appointments to new posts, and the provision o f infrastructure, are on track.
    The Public Service Commission has a new chairman, and a set o f new members, and has
    commenced with internal reforms. The Chief Advisor has convened a committee on civil
     service reform, including a number o f Cabinet members and secretaries. The government has
    announced that it i s planningto promulgate freedom o f information legislation.
    Corruption cases against a number o f former politicians and businessmen have been
    proceeding.     The Anticorruption Commission's jurisdiction has been amended through
     amendments to the ACC Act. A new organogram o f 1,281 staff has been approved by the
    National Implementation Committee on Administrative Reform. Prosecutions rules have
    beenpromulgatedand have come into operation.


                VI. RATIONALEFORPROPOSEDSUPPLEMENTALFINANCING

48.      The magnitude and devastation o f the flood and the required response from the
government are creating pressure on the government's FY08 budget. While the budget has a
small provision for handling such uncertainties, the havoc created by worse-than-usual monsoons
requires additional resources. The government has already redirected some o f its budgetary
resources for flood relief.     Grants or concessionary financing from development partners to
finance at least a portion o f the additional resource requirement i s perhaps the best economic
option for the country. Inthis context, the World Bank i s well placed to provide budget support
quickly in this hour o f need.         For its part, the government remains committed to the
implementation o f the reform program supported under the DSC series.

49.      A formal damage and needs assessment is expected after the flood waters recede
completely, which will provide an estimated measure o f total economic losses. From available
information, it i s already clear that the human, social, and economic impacts are sizeable.
Preliminary and incomplete figures indicate an estimated 11million people affected (with nearly
600 deaths so far), and damages to 1million homes, 1.1million hectares o f crop, and more than
23,000 hlometers o f road (see table 2, Section 11). The impact on growth and employment inthe
short runi s likely to occur as a result o f setbacks inagncultural production; losses in fisheries and
livestock assets; loss o f production in the small-scale manufacturing sector; and damage to
irrigation infrastructure, transport, and communication (see Section 19. Relief and reconstruction
costs are likely to be high. Early estimates suggest that the reconstruction costs o f the lost and
damaged infrastructure are likely to be at least half that o f the 2004 floods, implying more than
US$1billion. Emergency import needs, particularly inrice and other food items, and inputsfor
agriculture and construction can adversely impact the BOPposition.

50.      The proposed Supplemental Financing would help finance part o f the FY08 resource gap
incurred as a result o f the floods. The activities for which the emergency expenditures have been
incurred and will continue to be incurred inthe short runinclude food relief, assistance to farmers
on apcultural inputs, cash grants to the affected population, assistance to the small-scale
manufacturing sector for rehabilitation, and increased O&M expenditures to repair infrastructure
damage. Financing the resource gap arising out o f these emergency needs (by the proposed
Supplementary Financing) will allow the government to continue implementation o f the DSC IV-
supported macroeconomic and budget framework.            In the absence o f the proposed financing,



                                                   20

government would need to cut further into its existing O&M budget, reduce planned capital
spending allocations (ADP), or support to recurrent expenditure activities will have to be
significantly scaled down; alternatively the government will have to take recourse to domestic
borrowing, which i s three times more expensive relative to concessionary external financing, or
use monetary financing, which will fuel already highandrising inflation.

51.      The proposed operation i s consistent with Bank policy as reflected in OP 8.60.
According to this policy, supplemental financing may be provided for a development policy
operation for which an anticipated gap in financing jeopardizes a reform program that i s
otherwise proceeding on schedule and in compliance with the agreed-on policy agenda. More
specifically, the proposed Supplemental Financing, meets requirement for Supplemental
Financing under OP 8.60 as follows:

(a) Theprogram is being implemented in compliance with provisions of the Credit Agreement.
Bangladesh i s currently implementing a reform program supported by the DSC series in
compliance with all covenants.

(b) Theborrower is unable to obtain suf$cient funds from other lenders on reasonable terms or
in a reasonable time. Under government leadership, the Bank and other development partners are
coordinating the flood relief efforts. The proposed operation would be the second significant
financing package from external sources to help the government face immediate needs.I4 Other
development partners have pledged additional resources, which, along with the Supplemental
Financing, would contribute to closing the financing needs o f the government for urgent
rehabilitation, social support programs, and critical reconstruction investments in the flood-
affected areas. To this date the pledges have totaled only US$78.8 million; they also typically
take more time to come through and often lack flexibility in terms o f their use. The proposed
operation will therefore fulfill financing needs that are unlikely to be met by other donorsAenders.

(c) The time available is too short to process afurther freestanding Bank credit. The use o f a
Supplemental Financing option can enable the Bank to deliver program support in a timely
manner to respond to the urgent financial needs o f the country resulting from the floods. Even a
regular emergency project requires a comprehensive needs assessment, which i s not possible right
now because the floods are not over yet. Timely response from the Bank will help the people o f
the affected areas rebuild their lives.         Another planned budget support operation-the
Transitional Support Credit (TSC), a development policy credit as a follow-up to the DSC
series-is   currently under preparation and i s expected to be presentedto the Board inearly 2008.

(d) Theborrower is committed to theprogram and the implementing agencies have demonstrated
competencein carrying it out. The government has consistently shown commitment to pursuing
prudent macroeconomic policies over the medium and long term and implementing needed
structural reforms inline with its Poverty Reduction Strategy.


                           VII. IMPLEMENTATION          ARRANGEMENTS

A. Terms of the SupplementalFinancing
52.      Besides a legal opinion, there are no other requirements to this proposed Supplemental
Financing. There will, however, be an overall requirement that the government continue to
maintain a satisfactory macroeconomic policy framework as was required under the DSC series.


14  As mentioned earlier, Saudi Arabia has provided a grant of US$50 million.


                                                  21

Continued close engagement with the IMF will help the country in this effort. The closing date
for the Supplemental Financing i s March 31,2008.

B. FundsFlow andAuditingRequirementsfor the SupplementalFinancing
53.     Supplemental Financing proceeds will be disbursed in a single tranche and will be
deposited into a designated account maintainedby the Bangladesh Bank. The taka equivalent o f
the financing proceeds from this account will then be credited into the Consolidated Fundo f the
GOB. Transactions and balances o f the government account will be fully incorporated in the
government's accounting records and financial statements. Disbursements from the Consolidated
Fundbythe government shallnot be linked to any specific purchases, and no special procurement
requirement i s needed. While IDA disbursements will not be linked to specific expenditures, the
proceeds o f the Supplemental Financing shall not be used for excluded expenditures as set out in
the legal agreement.

54.     A review o f the institutional arrangements for public expenditure, financial management,
and procurement (followed by the PEFA assessment) concludes that the country system in place
does provide reasonable safeguards for reliance on government financial accountability to ensure
that funds are used for the purposes intended.

C. EnvironmentalIssues
55.     Policies supported by the proposed Supplemental Financing are not expected to have any
significantnegative effects on the environment, natural resources, or forests.


                                   VIII. BENEFITSAND RISKS

A. Benefits
56.      Timely program support will contribute to assisting the GOBincovering immediateneeds
for relief, livelihood support, and reconstruction by accessing financial assistance necessary to
mitigate the impact o f the floods.     The proposed Supplemental Financing (SF) will be an
important source o f resources for the government, as it will provide financing at a time when the
full impact of the disaster on government revenues is unknown, and there is an urgent need for
additional government expenditures. Donor pledges to date have been roughly US$72 million.
Pledges typically have a longer gestation lag than desired and so flexible financing o f the type
being proposed i s necessary to speed up the rehabilitation process. The proposed SF i s quick
disbursing and would contribute to timely provision o f support to affected populations. It will
also complement the support for medium- and long-term rehabilitation that i s being planned
through restructuring and reprogramming o f ongoing operations inthe Bank's portfolio.

57.      Finally, the Supplemental Financing will contribute to minimizingthe risks to the overall
reform program that i s being supported through the DSC series, and maintain the integrity o f the
transition to a Transitional Support Credit planned for 2008.

B. Risks
58.      Based on experience from other countries, there are risks involved with this type o f
assistance, relating primarily to the government's limited administrative capacity to implement
relief and reconstruction operations. This risk in Bangladesh is, however, partly mitigated by
recent evidence that indicates the country has a growing capacity for managing natural disasters.
The response so far to the 2007 flood emergency reflects these improvements, inparticular taking
into consideration the difficulties o f reaching remote communities when communications are


                                                22

interrupted and means are limited. The macroeconomic and social impact o fnatural disasters has
been greatly reduced, and the resilience o f the poor has increased. The factors contributing to this
improvement include greater nonfarm incomes, policies that have reduced leakages in food
distribution and allowed private sector imports, the highly effective and well-targeted Vulnerable
Group Feeding program, the construction o f cyclone shelters, and the establishment o f early
warning systems.       Recent experiences also indicate that Bangladesh has been increasingly
successful over time in providing assistance through cash grants in emergency situations,
distributed through a combination o f local governments and community targeting. The response
capability o f civil administrations has markedly improved, and government campaigns to educate
households on food and water safety precautions during floods and cyclones have proved
effective. Inaddition, the state has made space for and forged partnerships with NGOs to deliver
public services, and these organizations play a major role in disaster prevention, recovery, and
relief, enabling governments to respond promptly to disasters.

59.      Bangladesh is inherently vulnerable to flooding inthe wet season, which i s far from over.
There i s the risk o f repeated flooding in 2007-as   was the case in 1954 and 1955 and again in
 1987 and 1988--even if there i s no further heavy rainfall. Floodwaters could come from heavy
rains inNepal and India. Monsoon i s still active over the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghnabasins
(both the Indian part and Bangladesh).        The Brahmaputra-Jamuna has started rising rapidly
afresh.   Meteorological Departments o f Bangladesh and India forecast heavy to very heavy
rainfall over the country and sub-Himalayan areas in the coming weeks, and that rainfall
ultimately drains through Bangladesh. While the proposed Credit does not address these risks,
the multipronged strategy o f which it i s a part will aim at assisting the long-term mitigation o f
flood damage. Inaddition, the World Bank, ADB, W A C , other specialized UNagencies, and
several donor countries are also providing more medium term support to further strengthen the
government's capacity to respond and mitigate future flood damage.15

60.      The political situation continues to remain fluid in the country.      Inlate August, an
incident at Dhaka University (which started over a trivial incident at a soccer match) triggered
protests at a number o f universities throughout Bangladesh and spilled into the streets in some
locations. These protests were seen as the most serious threat yet to political stability since the
current CTG took office, with calls from some for an end to the emergency rule. While the CTG
controlled the law and order situation quickly by imposing a curfew in several cities, there
continues to be a risk o f such outbursts.        Any prolonged period o f protests may change
government priorities quickly and as a result the economic reform program may suffer. The
proposed operation i s assisting the country to manage the economic and social problems created
bythe ongoing floods.




 15 The proposed Water Management Improvement Project of the World Bank has a component for
    medium term water management and early warning that would further contribute to government's
    technical capacity for reducing flood damages.

IMFExecutiveBoardConcludes2007ArticleIV ConsultationwithBangladesh

PublicInformation Notice (PIN) No. 07/75
June 29,2007




On June 22,2007, the Executive Boardo f the InternationalMonetary Fund(IMF) concluded the
Article N consultation with Bangladesh.16


Background
Bangladesh's growth outlook and external position remain robust, but inflation has picked up.
The economy continued to grow at over 6% percent in the fiscal year ending June 2006 (FY06)
spurred by strong exports and investment. GDP growth i s expected to continue at around
6% percent in FY07 despite some supply-related disruptions, with lower agricultural growth
offset by strong manufacturing and service activities. Inflation has recently picked up to over 7
percent reflecting increases inboth food and nonfood prices.


The exchange rate has been relatively stable and international reserves have increasedthroughout
the period o f political upheaval. Reserves have reached beyond US$4 billion (approaching three
months o f imports) on the back o f continued strong remittances and exports, which are growing
at 25 and 21percent, respectively.


Overall macroeconomic stability has been maintained, but fiscal performance continues to suffer
from structural weaknesses. Revenue performance has consistently been below budget targets. In
addition, spending accelerated early in FY07 causing a surge in domestic financing o f the
government while delays in external disbursements further aggravated the situation. This forced
expenditure cuts later in the year to contain the overall deficit and domestic financing. As a
result, development expenditure was significantly underexecuted.


The growth in monetary and credit aggregates increased considerably in FY07. Broad money
growth reached a higho f 22 percent inDecember and private credit growth has been close to 20
percent for much o f the year. Reflecting better control o f government finances since January

                       ~~




l6Under Article IV o f the IMF'sArticles o f Agreement, the IMFholds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the
staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion o f
the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views o f Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.


                                                     28

                                                                                          Annex 2


2007, the growth inmonetaryaggregates has declined somewhat, but still remains above targeted
levels. With ample liquidity, bank lending and deposit interest rates have seen only modest
increases.


Petroleum prices have not kept pace with international prices leading to a deterioration o f
finances o f state-owned enterprises. After the April fuel price adjustments, domestic prices o f
diesel and kerosene are around 80percent o f their breakeven level and below prices in
neighboring countries. The losses accumulated inthe past have been financed through loans from
the nationalized commercial banks, and about two-thirds o f these loans are overdue contributing
to the weak financial health o f these banks.


The Bangladesh Bank has further advanced reforms aimed at deepening financial markets. The
regulatory framework has been strengthened, off-site and on-site supervision has been enhanced
and steps taken to restructure, corporatize, and privatize the large nationalized commercial
banks. These reforms have contributed to reducing the share o f the large nationalized banks and
strengthening the banking system. However, interest rate spreads are high and point to
inefficienciesinthe domestic banking system that detract fi-om efficient financial intermediation.


The current transitional government has moved to address several areas where reforms had
stalled. These include adjustments in fuel and electricity prices, introduction o f a Financial
Intelligence Unit, reconstituting the Anti-Corruption Commission, and separating the judiciary
from the executive branch.


Executive BoardAssessment
Executive Directors welcomed that macroeconomic stability with strong growth has been
maintained for several years, and that most o f the objectives o f the Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility-supportedprogram were achieved. Inflation was largely contained, poverty has
been reduced, and good progress has been made toward achieving the Millennium Development
Goals. The shift to a flexible exchange rate strengthened the external sector, helping to support
double-digit growth in exports and remittances and a significant improvement in international
reserves. Although fiscal discipline was maintained, revenues fell short. Looking forward,
growth i s expected to remain healthy, underpinned by buoyant exports, strong remittance flows,
and continued reform efforts. At the same time, weak revenue collections, poor infrastructure,
low skill levels, and governance issues remain important impediments to sustained growth and
furtherpovertyreduction.


Directors observed that revenue collections are insufficient to meet development needs or to
support the desired reductions in.tariffs and supplementary duties. They called for a fundamental
reform o f the tax system by broadening the tax base, separating the responsibility for tax policy
and collection, simplifyingVAT and income tax legislation, and consolidating and strengthening
the institutional structure o f tax administration. Directors welcomed the recent steps to
consolidate import taxes, but observed that the rate o f effective protectionremains high.


Directors welcomed the planned reforms in the area o f public financial management and the
adoption by major ministries o f the medium-term budget framework, but drew attention to the
underexecution o f development spending. They hoped that the adoption o f a regulatory
framework for the Public Procurement Act would raise the efficiency o f project implementation.

Directors supported the authorities' efforts to stem state-owned enterprise losses and ease
infrastructure bottlenecks. They welcomed the fuel price adjustments by the state-owned
petroleum company, but called for more timely adjustments through an automatic pricing
formula. Directors recommended adjusting the price o f domestically produced natural gas to
encourage efficient gas usage and raise government revenue.


Directors commended the authorities for their progress in strengthening central bank operations
and improving the institutional fkamework for monetary policy, and the steps taken to develop a
secondary market for government securities. They recommended further monetary tightening in
the face o f strong inflows and higher inflation, and with money and credit aggregates above
targeted levels. The recent pickup in inflation could become entrenched in the absence o f
corrective policies.


Directors considered that the flexible exchange rate regime has helped maintain competitiveness,
and remains appropriate. With reserves now at a more comfortable level, exchange market
intervention should be confined to alleviating disorderly conditions, and thus allowing greater
flexibility in the nominal rate to support stabilization objectives. Directors urged the authorities
to remove the remaining exchange restriction on the transferability o f funds innonresident taka
accounts.


Directors commended the authorities for improving financial sector surveillance, and
recommended that they build on recent financial sector reforms. They welcomed the
corporatization o f the remaining state-owned banks, hoped for a successful privatization o f
Rupali Bank, and encouraged the authorities to prepare the other state banks for eventual
divestment. Directors called on the authorities to bringbanking sector prudential guidelines more
inlinewith international standards and strengthenmonitoring, particularly inthe context ofrapid
credit growth. Directors commended the authorities for implementing many o f the
recommendations o f the 2003 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), and welcomed the
authorities' request for an FSAPupdate.


Directors supported the recent reforms to promote transparency, good governance in public
administration, fair elections, and the prevention o f money laundering and terrorist financing.
These reforms, if sustained, will improve overall efficiency and boost the investment climate.


Directors noted that data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but called for continued
efforts to improve data quality, including banking soundness indicators, and national accounts,
fiscal and debt statistics.


Directors looked forward to continued close cooperation and dialogue between the authorities
and the staff in support o f Bangladesh's reform objectives, possibly in the context o f a Fund-
supported program.
