ELECTRICITY GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
APPRAISAL OF THE PATTANI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Pattani Hydro-Electric Project for the Electricity Generating
Authority of Thailand (EGAT) consists of the Pattani development (3 x 20
MW), expansion of the transmission system and consulting services. The Pattani
hydro-electric development is located in Southern Thailand, an area which has
its own power grid that is not yet connected to the main EGAT grid. The power
generated will meet demand growth in the South and support the Provincial
Electricity Authority's (PEA) rural,electrification program which treats
Southern Thailand as a priority area. The transmission lines and substations
would be built in various parts of the country to support the Provincial
Electricity Authority's rural electrification program, a slice of which is
proposed for Bank financing in FY78. A study would be carried out of costs of
supply on a marginal cost basis of the whole power sector; the report would
recommend new tariff schedules.
ii.       EGAT has received an aggregate of US$232 million in seven loans
from the Bank since 1957. These have helped finance the expansion of the
generation and main transmission system in Thailand. Although the proposed
loan will be the eighth Bank project with EGAT and its predecessor, the grid
has not yet reached all areas of Thailand. Continued Bank assistance is
therefore desirable. The projects under the previous loans have all been
satisfactorily completed or are now under construction and no significant
problems have arisen during the period of the Bank's association with EGAT.
iii.      The total financing requirement of the proposed project is estimated
at US$159.7 million equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of
US$86.2 million. Project costs would be financed by: a Bank loan of US$50
million, including US$9.6 million for interest during construction; a loan of
US$20 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (KFAED); and
a loan of US$20 million from commercial banks. The balance of about US$69.7
equivalent would be financed by government equity and by EGAT from internal
cash generation.
iv.       The proposed Bank loan would be applied against the foreign exchange
cost of the main civil works and related engineering services of the Pattani
hydro-electric development; expansion of EGAT's transmission system; consulting
services for a tariff study; and interest during construction. Procurement
on the basis of international competitive bidding would be in accordance
with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines.
v.        Economic growth was substantial in the 1960's, the increase in
GDP averaging 8% per year; it slowed to 6.5% for the six years through 1976.
Demand for power grew in line with the expansion of the economy.



- ii -
vi.       Responsibility for the power sector in Thailand rests with three
organizations: EGAT is responsible for generation and transmission; PEA is
responsible for distribution in the provincial areas including some diesel
generation; and the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA) is responsible
for distribution in the Metropolitan Bangkok area.
vii.      EGAT is wholly Government owned and is organized as a modern pub-
lic utility. It is efficient both in its day-to-day operations, future
planning and project construction. Its financial history is good and
the current financial position is sound. There are no major staff recruit-
ment or training problems.
viii.     EGAT's expansion program required to meet the forecast growth
FY 77-83, is estimated to cost US$2.2 billion at escalated prices; the
proposed project would account for 7.2% of this amount. The Pattani project
as proposed, forms part of the least cost development program for EGAT's
southern Thailand grid at discount rates up to 12% when compared with an
alternative program which provides thermal power initially, instead of the
hydro-electric development.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank Loan of US$50 million for a
term of 20 years including a grace period of 5 years with the guarantee of
the Kingdom of Thailand.

APPRAISAL OF THE PATTANI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      This report covers the appraisal of the Pattani Hydro-Electric
Project for the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) for the
provision of hydro-generation facilities at Pattani in Southern Thailand,
expansion of the transmission system and the undertaking of a tariff study.
1.02      Total financing requirements of the project are estimated at $ 3273
million (US$159.7 million). The Bank has been asked to finance part of the
foreign exchange component in an amount of g 828 million (US$40.4 million),
interest during construction amounting to g 197 million (US$9.6 million)
would also be financed. The Kuwait Fund has agreed to provide a loan of about
$ 410 million (US$20 million) equivalent, to finance the foreign costs of equip-
ment, associated transmission facilities and related engineering services. The
commercial banks would finance about g 219 million (US$10.7 million) in foreign
exchange and $ 191 million (US$9.3 million) in local currency for the main civil
works. The balance of about g 1428 million (US$69.7 million) would be financed
from government equity and EGAT's internal cash generation.
1.03      This would be the Bank's eighth loan to EGAT and its predecessor.
Projects financed under the first six loans have been completed and are all
operating satisfactorily. The Ban Chao Nen hydro-project financed under Loan
977-TH of March 1974 is under construction and is progressing well.
1.04      The first project performance audit report was made in April 1976
for Loan 655-TH (2-125 MW units at Sirikit hydro station and 1-300 MW unit
at South Bangkok thermal station). It indicated that the financial performance
of EGAT was satisfactory for the period 1968-74. The rate of return on average
net fixed assets in operation was close to the projected level up to 1972.
From 1972 onward, it was below the appraisal estimate due to high operation
and maintenance, administration and fuel costs. EGAT's earnings covenant
with the Bank requires a 30% contribution to construction costs from internal
cash generation. The covenant has always been met.
1.05      The project now proposed is to assist EGAT in expanding its gener-
ation and transmission facilities and to continue the Bank's role in maintain-
ing EGAT's financial position through tariff increases and the introduction of
a fuel adjustment clause in EGAT's tariff schedule.

1.06      This report was based on a feasibility report prepared by EGAT's
consultants, Sverdrup and Parcel International, Inc., of USA and on information
gathered by Bank missions to Thailand in January and October, 1976.
II. THE COUNTRY, THE ECONOMY AND THE SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01      The Kingdom of Thailand is 514,000 sq km  in area and had a popula-
tion of 42.4 million in 1975, which was growing at a rate of about 2.7% per
year. Per capita GNP was about US$340 in 1975. Economic growth was substan-
tial in the 1960's, the increase in real GDP averaging 8% per year. Growth
slowed to 6.5% during the period 1970-75 largely due to weak export demand in
1970-71, a drought in 1972 which severely restricted agricultural production
and the slowdown in economic activity following the world energy crisis and
recession in 1974. The rate of growth of real GDP rose from 4.6% in 1974 to
5.5% in 1975, and a growth rate of about 6.5% is estimated for 1976. The
Government's draft Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-81) establishes a target growth
of 7% per annum.
2.02      Thailand is well endowed with land and water resources for agri-
cultural production. Agriculture is the major economic activity, contributing
about 31% of GDP, employing 80% of the labor force and providing about 67% of
merchandise export earnings in 1975. The manufacturing sector is small,
contributing about 17% of GDP, 14% of merchandise exports and 4% of employment,
but growing fairly rapidly at about 10% p.a. on average (1970-75). Significant
tourism development is also taking place, and tourism is now a major source
(8%) of foreign exchange.
The Power Sector
General
2.03      The power sector consists of three state enterprises and 53 private
franchises (at end-FY75). The state enterprises are the Electricity Generat-
ing Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA)
and the Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA).
The Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)
2.04      EGAT was established in 1968 by the merger of three public elec-
tricity authorities: the Yanhee Electricity Authority; the Northeast Elec-
tricity Authority; and the Lignite Authority. The Yanhee Electricity Authority
had been established in 1957 as a condition of the first power loan to
Thailand. The purpose of the merger was to increase the efficiency of elec-
tricity supply throughout the country and to coordinate the generation and
transmission systems.
2.05      EGAT is now responsible for most of the generation and transmission
in the public sector. It accounted for 92.6% (8212 Gwh) of all electrical
energy (8866 Gwh) generated in Thailand in FY75, the balance being generated
by other utilities (2.6%) and by self-generating industries (4.8%). EGAT
sells energy in bulk to MEA, PEA, and to large industrial consumers.



-3-
The Metropolitan Electricity Authority (MEA)
2.06      MEA, a state enterprise, was established in 1958 with the objective
of supplying electricity to the Bangkok MIetropolitan Area encompassing Bangkok,
Thonburi, Nonthaburi and Samut Prakon. In FY76 MEA was serving nearly 541,000
consumers with a peak demand of about 934 MW and sales of about 5,291 Gwh (65%
of the national total).
The Provincial Electricity Authority (PEA)
2.07      PEA was established in September 1960 as a wholly Government-owned
Corporation with the responsibility of providing and distributing electricity
in all provinces of the country except in the area served by the Metropolitan
Electricity Authority. US$3.6 million of a US$21.0 million Bank loan to
Thailand in 1976 (Loan 1198T-TH) was onlent to PEA to help finance its rural
electrification (RE) program in selected villages in 10 provinces in the north-
east region. The Bank has also recently appraised a more comprehensive slice
of PEA's RE program covering 20 provinces for possible joint financing with
the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the OPEC Special
Fund. PEA purchases most of its energy in bulk from EGAT but also generates
electricity in areas not yet connected to the grid. In FY76, PEA served
about 931,000 consumers with a peak demand of about 601 MW and sales of about
2,582 Gwh. Ninety-two percent of its energy requirements were purchased from
EGAT representing 30% of EGAT's sales, and 8% were locally generated.
Twenty-four percent of the energy sold was used by residential consumers, 45%
by industrial consumers, 30% by commercial consumers, and about 1% for street
lighting. (Highlights of the operations of MEA, PEA and EGAT are given in
Annex 1.)
Private Franchises
2.08      The 53 private franchises at end FY75 had an installed capacity
of 5.7 MW in diesel plant and sold 211 Gwh. About 30 franchise holders pur--
chased their power needs in bulk from PEA and the remainder generated their
requirements. Low profitability following the fuel crisis has caused most of
the self-generating franchises to ask to be taken over by PEA. The takeover
is scheduled to be completed by end-FY77 at a total estimated cost of $ 220
million (US$10.7 million) in compensation; individual amounts of compensation
which will be negotiated on a willing-buyer, willing-seller basis, have yet
to be agreed.
Government Agencies
2.09      The power sector has been poorly coordinated in the past at the
policy-making level; the three state enterprises have followed separate
policies within their jurisdictions having different tariffs, consumer con-
tributions and connection criteria. The situation has been aggravated by
EGAT reporting to the Prime Minister's Office and MEA and PEA to the Ministry
of the Interior, although each of the two organizations reports to different
officials.



- 4 -
2.10      Several Government agencies also have a direct interest in the power
sector in addition to the departments to which the utilities report. These
are:
Tariff Rate Committee;
National Economic and Social Development Board;
Ministry of Finance;
Budget Bureau;
National Energy Administration; and
Rural Electrification Board.
These agencies consider and approve: tariff recommendations for submission
to the Council of Ministers; capital project proposals and budgets; annual
financial performances; and Government equity and loans. None of them has
overall policy responsibility, decisions on the sector being arrived at after
all the agencies including the state enterprises reach a consensus. However,
a major step towards remedying the situation has been taken by the formation
of a sector policy committee during the latter half of 1976 made up of the
above Government agencies and the three utilities with the object of agreeing
coordinated policy for the sector.
2.11      The system has worked well to ensure that sector capital expendi-
tures are rigidly controlled, but the fiscal emphasis of the approval process
has constrained sector development to some extent. Financial yields have
formed the basis for connections and consequent grid extensions rather than
long term economic gains. Village connections by both PEA and MEA could have
been accelerated and EGAT could have provided more main transmission lines and
substations to extend the grid, if longer term economic considerations had
governed sector development.
Energy Requirements and Resources
2.12      Total energy consumption in the 1956-75 period increased from about
I million tons of oil equivalent to nearly 9 million tons, at an average an-
nual growth rate of 11%. As a percentage of total energy requirements
(expressed in heating value), consumption in 1975 was as follows:
Percent
Petroleum                       79.2
Hydro                           11.0
Coal                             2.2
Charcoal and Wood                0.7
Paddy Husk and Bagasse           6.9
Total                100.0



2.13      Thailand's energy resources consist of hydro-power, limited petro-
leum and coal, large but as yet uneconomical oil shale deposits, charcoal,
wood, paddy husk, and bagasse. Its hydro potential totals about 11,000 MW
and 40,000 Gwh (excluding the potential on two international rivers, the
Mekong and the Salween) of which only 909 MW or 8.8 percent are presently
exploited. Coal deposits are estimated at about 150 million tons of which
about 75 million tons can be commercially exploited. Following the oil
crisis, EGAT converted one oil-fired generating unit (75 MW) at North Bangkok
to lignite and now has two 75 MW lignite burning units under construction at
Mae Moh. Proven reserves of petroleum total about 2.5 million barrels
(consumption of petroleum products in 1975 was 76 million barrels) but ex-
ploration is being carried out in the Northeast and in the Gulf of Thailand.
Preliminary results indicate an off-shore gas deposit which could generate
about 1,000 MW over a 30-year period. Oil shale deposits are estimated at
about 2,700 million barrels which, if economically exploitable, could meet
Thailand's domestic requirements at the current rate of consumption for about
50 years.
2.14      A future potential source of power for EGAT could be from hydro
facilities on the Mekong River. The hydro-electric potential of this river
and its tributaries is substantial. The first phase of the 135 MW Nam Ngum
project on a tributary of the Mekong in Laos was completed in early 1972
and EGAT has been receiving energy from it since. The Pa MIong project on
the Mekong River about 18 miles from Vientiane, where it forms the border
between Thailand and Laos, has a potential of 2,800 - 4,800 MW. However,
the earliest date by which Pa Mong power could be available is in the late
1980's but political and resettlement problems cloud the possible development
of this site.
Demand and Supply of Electric Power
2.15      In FY75, total generating capacity was 2,754 MW, of which 2,537 MW
were owned by the state enterprises, 6 MW by the private sector and 211 MW
by the self-generating industries. Out of 2,754 MW, 909 MrW were hydro;
1,479 MW, steam; 201 MW, diesel; and 165 MW, gas turbine. Total energy
generation in FY75 was 8,866 Gwh, of which 8,430 Gwh were generated by the
state enterprises, 10 Gwh by the private sector and 426 Gwh by self-
generating industries. Hydroelectric plants produced 3,399 Gwh; steam power
plants, 5,197 Gwh; diesel units, 239 Gwh; and gas turbines, 31 Gwh. Gene-
ration per capita was 209 kwh in FY75.
2.16      Despite the restraint on sector growth, expansion has been con-
siderable. Since 1966, total energy sold has grown from 1496 Gwh to 7468 Gwh
in 1975, a growth rate of 19%.
2.17      The household connection rate 1/ achieved in the country at end-
FY75 was 22% as shown below:

Households Connected (%)                    22
Consumption (Gwh)                        7,468
2.18      Thailand's per capita consumption of power in FY75 was 176 kwh com-
pared to 229 kwh in the Philippines, 490 kwh in Korea and 30 kwh in Indonesia.
Regional imbalances currently exist and the Southern Region, which the
proposed project would serve, has barely 20% of households connected compared
to nearly 40% in the wealthier Central Region (including Bangkok). Access to
electrification by regions is shown in Annex 2.
2.19      EGAT's development strategy has been to utilize available hydro
resources and supplement these with thermal plants based on the least cost
solution. The major hydro plants are associated with multipurpose reservoirs.
The mixed hydro-thermal system has served EGAT well and has enabled it to
utilize fully the available hydro capability while giving irrigation demand
priority. MEA's development strategy is to expand and improve the distribu-
tion system to provide a reliable and adequate supply to meet consumer demand
and to give every household in its service area access to electricity by 1981.
PEA's development strategy is to extend its system as quickly as possible and
to promote electrification in the rural areas. Up to the end of FY76, 11,000
villages out of a total of 48,000, had been electrified.
2.20      For the FY70-76 period, total sector investment was about US$755 mil-
lion with EGAT's share US$510 million or 67%; MEA, 16% and PEA, 17%. Invest-
ment in the power sector averaged about 1% of GDP and about 17% of public   -
investment annually.
III. THE BORROWER
3.01      The Borrower would be EGAT, established in 1968 by a merger of
three generation and transmission authorities. EGAT is a financially sound,
well organized and operated utility. The Guarantor would be the Kingdom
of Thailand.
Organization and Management
3.02      EGAT is organized and functions as a modern public utility with a
considerable degree of autonomy, charged with the operation of the power
generation and transmission installations under its jurisdiction and the
establishment of such new facilities as may be required for the Thai power



-7-
grid including all generation facilities and transmission down to 69 kV. It
does not have responsibility for isolated diesel generation or for transmis-
sion and distribution below 69 kV.
3.03      The Board of  Directors consists of a Chairman and not more than
ten other members, including the General Manager. The Chairman and other
members of the Board are appointed by the Council of Ministers. All Board
members act in a part-time capacity with the exception of the General
Manager.
3.04      EGAT had a total of 14,302 employees at end-FY76.  The management
and staff are able and well qualified: 1456 are university graduates; 1547
have diplomas and higher professional education; and 2412 higher vocational
education. (See Annex 3 for Organization Chart.)
Training
3.05      EGAT operates a training school to assist in upgrading its staff.
It also provides opportunities for attendance at courses and seminars both
inside and outside Thailand to enable staff to keep abreast of up-to-date
techniques and methods appropriate to their work. EGAT has no training
problems and no difficulties in recruitment.
Accounting and Audit
3.06      EGAT follows the "Uniform System of Accounts" of the US Federal
Power Commission. The accounting system is well operated and administered by
a competent staff. Annual accounts are prepared within the time limit of 90
days after the end of the fiscal year imposed by the EGAT Act. Accounting has
been computerized over the past two years, and the system is working efficiently.
3.07      Audit of the accounts is carried out by the National Audit Council,
the Government organization responsible for auditing all State enterprises
in the country. Since the early 1960's the international accounting firm, -
Coopers and Lybrand of London, has been retained as financial consultants by
EGAT and its predecessor to assist the Audit Council and issue a separate
report on the annual accounts each year. EGAT is satisfied with this arrange-
ment and during negotiations agreed to continue using financial consultants.
Tariffs
3.08      EGAT's tariffs are the standard two-part type which charges consu-
mers separately for their demand (kw) and energy (kwh); they are appropriate
for a supplier of bulk power.
3.09      Periodic reductions in the tariffs of EGAT, MEA and PEA were made
during the decade up to FY74 due to economies of scale and consequent reduc-
tions in unit costs. During FY74, EGAT's tariffs were increased by about 50
percent to compensate for increased fuel prices following the fuel crisis.
3.10      During FY75, PEA's residential tariffs were reduced to equate with
MEA's and to promote rural electrification. With this reduction, PEA's reve-
nues no longer covered its costs but about 2/3 of the shortfall was covered by



- 8 -
increased tariffs to MEA's and EGAT's industrial consumers with EGAT chan-
neling funds from MEA to PEA by charging PEA lower tariff levels for bulk
power than MEA, based on 1975 load factors. Sector costs of operation and
construction have substantially increased and a tariff increase for all three
entities is necessary to maintain the sector's financial position. The cur-
rent position requires an increase of a minimum of 29% to contribute to the funds
required for construction through FY78 when the results of a tariff study to
be carried out under the project (para 3.12) would be implemented. Concur-
rently, the funds channeled from MEA to PEA require review annually to ensure
that both authorities are supplied with the funds needed to continue their
expansion programs. The Council of MIinisters has recently approved a sector
tariff increase of 29%, to be implemented by August 1, 1977.
3.11      Government and EGAT covenanted in the agreement for Loan 977-TH that
a fuel adjustment clause would be included in EGAT's tariff schedules to increase
or decrease the basic energy charge to compensate for changes in the cost of fuel
to EGAT. The mid-1974 deadline for meeting this covenant was extended at the
Government's request because it was then reviewing the implications of its power
sector tariff policies on its rural electrification program. Subsequently, the
Government adopted a policy of subsidizing the cost of fuel to the sector, which
lessened the urgency for a fuel adjustment. The policy of subsidizing fuel was
discontinued, at the Bank's urging, in early 1977. The fuel adjustment clause
has now been introduced in EGAT's tariff schedules; in accordance with Government
policy, this clause includes provision for approval by the Council of Ministers
of any adjustment required.
3.12      A Bank mission made a study of Thailand's power tariffs in 1974 and
produced a research working paper (P.U. Report No. RDS4 of December 1974). The
report confirmed the basic soundness of EGAT's financial policies and position
and, to further strengthen financial performance in the power sector, recommended,
inter alia, that a thorough investigation of the levels and structure of marginal
costs and of load characteristics be carried out. In addition, staff studies
suggested that the Government's rural electrification program will require to be
cross-financed within a rationalized tariff structure for the whole of Thailand.
The Bank staff has recommended, and the Government leans toward the same view,
that subsidies of all kinds, including equity, soft local loans, corporate tax
exemptions and excise duty exemptions, be discontinued. Government and EGAT
have agreed to carry out a tariff study of the entire power sector on a marginal
cost basis using a team from the various agencies and utilities that cover the
power sector. The loan and guarantee agreements include appropriate under-
takings for completion of the study; cover the employment of consultants
if the Bank considers them necessary, the estimated cost of which is provided
for in the loan; and provide for the recommendations which are agreed with the
Bank, to be implemented by the end of FY78. Draft terms of reference are
given in Annex 4.
Existing Facilities
3.13      EGAT had a total of 2437 MW in service at the end of FY76 made
up of 909 MW hydro; 1334 MW steam; 165 MW gas turbines; and 29 MW diesel.
Three voltage levels are used for transmission lines: 230 kV, 115 kV and 69 kV,
with a total length of 7943 km at end-76. Eighty-eight substations were in
service with an installed capacity of 3347 MVA. EGAT's system is modern and
efficient; plant is well operated and maintenance is of a high standard.
3.14      Three additional generating plants are under construction with a
total installed capacity of 810 MW (360 MW hydro and 450 MW thermal including



150 M\W to be fired by lignite).  Annexes 5 and 6 give additional details and
the map attached shows the location of generating plants and the transmission
lines.
Future Development
3.15      EGAT has prepared a program covering the period FY77-83 to meet the
demand and energy requirements based on forecasts prepared by I4EA and PEA.
The forecast for MEA's area is based on demand arising from normal economic
expansion and income growth in the Bangkok letropolitan area. In the case of
PEA's area, the demand forecast is based on the increase in demand in the
existing system and the demand arising from the system expansion projects
scheduled for completion, including the electrification of about 20,000 vil-
lages over the seven-year period. Financial considerations have led in the
past to EGAT refusing to build transmission lines and substations to meet
PEA's needs; however, EGAT's obligation to contribute an adequate contribu-
tion (20%) to construction from internal cash generation, and the tariff ad-
justments this requires, should ensure that sufficient funds and consequently
facilities will be available to meet all economic demand.
3.16      Capital investment in EGAT's development program FY77-83 totals
about $ 35 billion (US$1.7 billion) at 1976 prices, including interest during
construction. Incremental costs per kW on an escalated basis are about US$675
which is a reasonable figure in view of the fact that the transmission element
is small during this period and escalation factors used for Thailand are low
compared to other countries because inflation is comparatively low. Annex 7
shows EGAT's power development program as a graph; Annex 8 shows a tabulation
of system generation requirements and available capability.
3.17      The existing system is divided into four regions as shown on the
attached map. All regions are interconnected with the exception of Region 3
located in Southern Thailand on the Malay Peninsula. An interconnecting link
for which ADB is considering a loan, is scheduled for completion in FY79. This
will increase operational flexibility and form a good complement to the Pattani
development in the southern system.
IV. THE PROJECT
4.01      The proposed project will comprise:  (a) the Pattani hydro-electric
development, including resettlement; (b) the expansion of EGAT's transmission
system in support of the rural electrification program; and (c) a tariff study.
Pattani Hydro-electric Development
4.02      The Pattani hydro-electric development, located about 825 km south of
Bangkok in the extreme south of Peninsular Thailand, will include an 85 m high
and 422 m long rock-filled dam with a total volume of about 2.9 million cu m.
The reservoir will have an effective storage capacity of 995 million cu m, about
70% of average annual inflow. An open channel chute-type spillway controlled
by 2 radial gates will be located in the right abutment. The intake will be
built in a combined structure with the spillway. It will be provided with a
semi-circular trashrack and a fixed wheel type gate. It will feed into



- 10 -
an underground power conduit of welded steel pipe embedded in concrete. The
powerhouse will be a surface type reinforced concrete structure, located below
the dam. It is designed to house 3 units of 20 MW each. The switchyard is
located on the southeast end of the powerhouse and equipped with step-up trans-
formers, switching and protection equipment. A 115 kV double circuit line will
transmit the power to the Yala substation about 40 km away. (Annex 9 provides
project details.)
Transmission System Expansion
4.03      The existing transmission system and substations of EGAT have to
be expanded to meet the increasing load requirements. Included in this
project is a part of EGAT's Transmission System Expansion Project No. 3
(1977-1981) specifically designed to support the rural electrification pro-
gram of PEA in the following areas:
Northern Area
1.   115 kv Phayao-Chiangrai Line and Substations, 90 km long.
Northeastern Area
2.   115 kv Udonthani-Loei Line and Substations, 140 km long;
3.   115 kv Phon-Chaiyaphum Line and Substations, 65 km long;
4.   115 kv Ubon Ratchathani-Sisaket Line and Substations,
62 km long;
5.   Buriram Substation; and
6.   Phang Khon Substation.
Southern Area
7.   115 kv Yala-Narathiwat Line and Substations, 70 km long.
Tariff Study
4.04      A tariff study will be carried out to ascertain the marginal costs
of supplying power to consumers at different voltage levels. The study report
would be expected to recommend a single tariff schedule for application to
consumers of both MEA and PEA with the object of eliminating all capital and
operating subsidies from the sector and assessing the effect of taxation on
the sector. The report would also recommend the manner of transferring cash
to PEA (provincial areas) from MEA (Bangkok area), possibly by EGAT continuing
to charge PEA a lower price for bulk power than that charged MEA; tariff
schedules for EGAT's bulk power would be recommended accordingly. The draft
terms of reference are given in Annex 4 (also see para 3.12).

4.06      The physical contingency on civil works is estimated to be 10.5% of
basic cost. This is adequate after taking into account design changes recom-
mended by the International Consulting Board which are now being reviewed by EGAT
(para. 4.10). On electrical and mechanical equipment and transmission facilities,
the physical contingencies average 8% and 5% respectively. The price contingencies
for foreign and local costs were derived by applying the following rates of esca-
lation: for civil works, 9% in 1977-79, and 8% thereafter; for equipment and
transmission lines, 7.5% in 1977-79 and 7% thereafter. A detailed cost estimate
of the Pattani hydroelectric development is given in Annex 10 and that of the
transmission system expansion in Annex 11.
Financial Arrangements
4.07      The proposed Bank loan of US$50.0 million would finance part of the
foreign exchange cost of main civil works and the total foreign exchange cost
of (i) construction equipment required by EGAT to carry out resettlement;
(ii) related engineering services of the Pattani project on main civil works;
(iii) expansion of EGAT's transmission system to support rural electrification;
(iv) consulting services for a tariff study; and (v) interest during construction
on the Bank loan. The foreign exchange cost of equipment (gates and hoists, tur-
bines, generators, transformers, cranes) associated transmission facilities and
related engineering services, amounting in total to about US$20 million would be
financed from the Kuwait Fund. A group of commercial banks led by the Bank
of Tokyo would finance US$20.0 million of the foreign and local costs of the
main civil works. The balance of the local costs and interest during construc-
tion on the Kuwait and commercial bank loans would be financed by government
equity and EGAT's internal cash generation.
4.08      The proposed financing arrangements are as follows:

Procurement
4.09      All civil works, materials and equipment financed under the proposed
Bank loan will be procured on the basis of international competitive bidding
in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. The Bank's usual prefer-
ence of 15% (or the custom duties, whichever is less) will be granted to local
manufacturers. Construction for preliminary works and resettlement will be
carried out by EGAT's work force, supplemented by local contractors. Items
financed by the Kuwait Fund will follow KFAED procurement guidelines.
Disbursement
4.10      Disbursements for construction equipment for resettlement and sub-
station equipment would be made against the c.i.f. cost of directly imported
equipment and materials, or 100 percent of total expenditures ex-factory for
equipment and materials manufactured locally, and 65 percent of total expendi-
tures for imported equipment and materials procured locally. Disbursements on
the main civil works and transmission lines would be at 42% and 50%, respec-
tively, of total expenditures. For the consulting and engineering services,
disbursements would be 100% of the foreign exchange costs. A disbursement
schedule is given in Annex 12.
Engineering Services
4.11      The feasibility study and the preliminary design report of the
Pattani project were prepared by Sverdrup & Parcel International, Inc. (SPI)
of San Francisco in 1969 and 1974 respectively. Additional studies were
undertaken during 1976 based on the recommendations of the Bank's consult-
ant on dam construction. EGAT has also engaged SPI for the design, prepara-
tion of tender documents and evaluation of bids for the main civil works and
equipment. EGAT intends to continue the services of SPI for the detailed
design and construction supervision of the project. The Bank has no objection
to this arrangement. An amount equal to about 4% of the estimated cost of the
Pattani development has been included, equivalent to about 600 man-months at
US$5,500/man-month. The importance of the work makes additional consulting
opinion desirable and EGAT has retained the services of the International
Consulting Board for the Ban Chao Nen Project for the Pattani Project as well.
Implementation Schedule
4.12      Specifications and tender documents for the civil works contract
were issued with Bank approval in December 1976. Bids were opened in April
1977 and are now under evaluation by EGAT. This should allow the contract to
be awarded by September 1977, after expected loan approval and signing. For equip-
ment contracts, tenders will be issued in mid-1977 and contracts awarded in early
1978. Civil works construction will start in late 1977 and be completed by early
1981. Filling of the reservoir would commence in the wet season of 1980 and all
three units are scheduled to be commissioned before the end of 1981. Total con-
struction time is about 4-1/2 years. A detailed implementation schedule is shown
in Annex 13. Specifications and tender documents for the transmission system
expansion will be issued in early 1978 and awarded before end-1978. All lines and
substations are scheduled for completion before end-1981.

Hydrology
4.13      Hydrology is based on a fifteen-year record period (1962-1976).
A correlation study was made between rainfall and runoff to establish the
long-term runoff at the dam site. The probable maximum flood, using well
recognized methods, gives a peak discharge of about 6700 cu m /sec and a volume
of about 1800 million cu m . The freeboard provided is adequate to accomodate
the flood and also for the abnormal condition when one of the spillway gates
is out of operation during a 1000-year flood.
4.14      Based on the suspended sediment rating curve at the dam site, the
annual sediment load is estimated at about 500,000 tons a year. The dead
storage of 210 million cu m is adequate to take care of the sediment inflow over
the life of the project. (Further details are provided in Annex 14.)
Geology
4.15      The geological investigation of the project consisted of 54 drill
holes with a total length of 1882 m, 49 wash holes, 93 test pits, 3 adits and
2 trenches. EGAT is currently driving a pilot tunnel along the alignment of
the diversion tunnel and stripping both abutments at the dam site in order to
provide additional information for detailed design.
4.16      Although there are limestone deposits upstream of the dam-site they
are all located at higher elevations, well above the reservoir. No reservoir
leakage is anticipated. The possibility of landslides in the reservoir area
is also small as the slope of the banks is gentle and the vegetation cover
extremely good.
4.17      In general, although the geomorphology of the site is not the best,
it is feasible to construct a dam using sound engineering practice and care -
particularly in foundation treatment. (Details are given in Annex 15.)
Ecology
4.18      In 1975, EGAT engaged the Southeast Asia Technology Co. Ltd. (SEATEC)
in association with the National Institute of Development Administration (NIDA)
and Mahidol University to carry out an Environmental and Ecological Investiga-
tion of the Pattani Multipurpose Project. The study covers the following
disciplines: land and water resources; forestry; fisheries; mining; aquatic
plants; wildlife; archaeology; health; socio-economic aspect; and resettlement.
The draft of the Summary Report (Vol. 1) was made available to the Bank in
November 1976 witih the understanding that the whole report will be completed
in 1977.
4.19      The summary report concludes that (i) the project will have no sig-
nificantly adverse effects upon the climatic conditions of the Pattani river
basin; (ii) the mineral deposits in the Pattani reservoir are scarce and there
are no operating mines in the catchment area, accordingly the effect on mineral
resources is negligible; (iii) no significant items of archaeological, histo-
rical or cultural importance will be lost due to inundation; (iv) the total



- 15 -
volume of marketable timber in the reservoir area was found to be very small
and will be harvested before reservoir impounding; (v) the forest at elevations
higher than the reservoir full supply level will be kept undisturbed in order
to provide home ranges for various species of wildlife; (vi) malaria and
diarrhea are the most dangerous diseases in the project area, followed by mal-
nutrition and parasitic diseases. Adequate health and malaria control faci-
lities would be provided at the construction site. In short, there is no
single ecological consequence or combination of consequences, which is so
significantly important as to preclude construction of the project. The report
also made recommendations for further monitoring, both on a short-term and a
long-term basis. EGAT intends to follow these recommendations in carrying out
the project and assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations.
4.20      The total area to be flooded is about 5744 hectares of which about
2010 ha are forest; 3200 ha, rubber plantations; 460 ha, mixed orchards; 60
ha, residential houses; and 14 ha, rice paddies and coconuts.
4.21      A total number of 3,256 inhabitants will need to be resettled
and EGAT will provide a sum of $ 300 million (US$14.6 million) or 10% of total
construction expenditures for this purpose. This is equivalent to US$4,500
per inhabitant, about 6 times the amount provided for the Ban Chao Nen project.
This is because of the high compensation costs for the rubber plantations
which account for 40% of the cost of the resettlement program. About 90% of
the villagers own their land; there are no large holdings. EGAT has been
carrying out a successful resettlement program for the Ban Chao Nen Project.
EGAT organized a visit to Ban Chao Nen of people living in the reservoir area
and their only additional request was to have the land (EGAT will provide
about 3.2 hectares for each family) cleared for them. EGAT also agreed to
employ the local villagers in project construction as much as practicable
(Annex 16).
4.22      During negotiations, Government agreed to guarantee that (i) a re-
settlement coordinating committee would be established by September 30, 1977;
(ii) a detailed resettlement plan would be submitted to the Bank for approval
by March 31, 1978; (iii) the Committee would be made responsible for the
implementation of the plan and EGAT for construction; and (iv) the Government
would provide any funds needed in excess of $ 300 million should this amount
prove inadequate for the purpose.
Risks
4.23      EGAT has minimized the risks to the project to the extent possible.
As mentioned above, the Authority has engaged an International Consulting Board
whose advice will be sought if any unusual technical problems arise. To pre-
clude the possibility of uneconomically high bid prices for the main civil works
due to the political instability of the area, tenders have already been called
and opened. To minimize potential problems during project execution, EGAT has
gathered the support of area residents, developing a mutually satisfactory re-
settlement scheme and offering them employment during the construction period.
The fact that EGAT has been on site since April 1976 without incident suggests
that the project is welcomed as part of the Government's increased effort to
speed development of this relatively neglected region. Remaining risks are not
judged to be great enough to preclude proceeding with the project.

V. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
The Overall Power Market
5.01      The power market in Thailand comprises the Greater Metropolitan
area of Bangkok served by MEA; the provincial areas served by PEA; and
bulk supplies made by EGAT to industries and to Electricite de Laos (EDL).
The distribution of peak demand and energy sales in FY76 was as follows:
Peak Demand           Energy Sales
(MIW)                  (Gwh)
MEA                          955.6   58.0%       5,594.1    64.3%
PEA                          607.2   36.9%       2,655.3    30.5%
INDUSTRIES & EDL              89.3    5.1%         446.3      5.2%
TOTAL          1,652.1  100.0%       8,695.7   100.0%
5.02      At the end of FY66, EGAT's predecessors served a peak demand of 318
MW and generated 1515 Gwh; the average annual load factor was 54.4%. Ten
years later peak demand had increased to 1652 MW, generation to 9414 Gwh and
the annual load factor had improved to 65%. In the ten-year period, there was
a four-fold increase in power requirements. Average annual growth rates were
18% for peak demand and 20% for energy, respectively. Early stimulants were
rapidly rising investments, favorable world rice markets, and services to the
U.S. military. As a result of the oil crisis and world economic recession,
the low point was reached in FY74 when demand and energy requirements increased
by only 4.8% and 5.6% respectively. However, system growth recovered in FY76
to 17.4% and 14.6% respectively (Annex 17).
5.03      The load forecast made by EGAT was based on the consolidation of the
MEA and PEA forecasts and industries supplied directly. MEA based its fore-
cast on the assumption that its service area would be fully electrified
by FY81 and PEA took into account the natural growth of the existing system
and its plan for developing new extensions into the rural areas. Peak demand
to be served by EGAT in FY86 is forecast at about 4,192 MW and generation
at 24,966 Gwh. This arises from an average annual growth rate of about 11.2%
for FY77-81 and 8.5% for FY82-86. The forecast is considered to be an accep-
table basis for the power development program.
Power Development Program
5.04      EGAT, following its past policies, has developed a power program
based on least cost solutions to provide adequate operational flexibility
and diversify primary energy resources. Projects included in its FY77-86
program are listed below (Annexes 7 and 8).

5.05      Total additions consist of 3128 MW made up of 928 MW of hydro, 300 MW
of thermal fired with lignite, 1300 MW of thermal fired with oil and 600 MW of
possible nuclear. The first three projects listed are currently under construc-
tion. The Ban Chao Nen hydro-electric project is being financed by the Bank
(Loan 977-TH) and OECF; ADB is considering a loan for financing the 100 MW
No. 7 unit at Bhumibol and the Central-South tie line; the Pattani Hydro-
electric project will be the next project to be implemented. The program is
therefore firm up to 1981, beyond which further studies to determine the
optimum solutions will be required.
5.06      The justification of a 600 MW nuclear unit by 1985 is under review
by EGAT based on the relative economy between conventional oil-fired thermal
plant and a nuclear unit.
Regional Load Forecast
5.07      Load growth for the southern system (Region 3) has been 16.9%
p.a. on average for peak demand and 14.1% p.a. for energy generation in the
past five years. Peak demand in FY76 was 90.7 MW representing a 29.2% increase
over the previous year. Annex 18 summarizes regional generation records since
FY71 and the forecast of generation requirements from FY77-86. Growth rates
average about 10.3% p.a. for peak demand and 11.7% for energy generation.



- 18 -
Regional Development
5.08      The electrical system in southern Thailand is at present isolated
from the other regions; interconnection between the southern and central
regions will not be realized until 1979 and then with a tie-line of only 40
MW capacity; and the power output of the Pattani hydro-electric development is
small compared to the whole EGAT system. Therefore, the justification of the
project was made on a regional basis.
5.09      The main generating facilities in the southern system consist of two
15 MW gas turbine units at Hat Yai, a 30 MW oil-fired thermal unit at Surat
Thani, a 3 x 20 M4W lignite plant at Krabi and diesel units at Phuket (4 x 2.65
MW) totaling 130.6 MW.
5.10      To meet the load requirements for Region 3, EGAT's proposed develop-
ment program up to 1981 is as follows:
(a) installation of two 15 14W gas turbines at Hat Yai by 1977
and 1978 respectively;
(b) construction of a 115 kv tie line between the central
and southern system for commissioning by 1979;
(c) construction of the Pattani hydro-electric development,
3 x 20 MW, for commissioning by 1981.
Least Cost Solution for the Pattani Hydro Development
5.11      The Lang Suan hydroelectric project is still in the investigation
stage, it cannot be completed before 1983. The only possible alternative would
be an oil-fired thermal unit of 30 MW capacity which would generate about the
same amount of energy at a capacity factor of 75%.
5.12      The following two alternative programs were compared:
Program A      Program B
1981              Pattani        Thermal
(3 x 20 MW)   (1 x 30  XW)
1983              Thermal        Pattani
(1 x 30 MW)   (3 x 20 MW)
5.13      The sum of total investment costs, operating costs and fuel costs
of the two alternatives were compared on a present worth basis. Efficiency
prices were used with foreign exchange costs shadow priced at a ratio of 1.1
and local costs at a weighted /1 ratio of 0.85 for the hydroelectric scheme
and 0.95 for the thermal alternative. Program A with early Pattani was found
to be the least cost solution for discount rates up to 12.0% (Annex 19).
/1 For unskilled laborers.



- 19 -
5.14      Since this is a multipurpose project, Government has agreed to
contribute about g 600 million (US$29.3 million) towards the cost of the
dam for downstream irrigation and flood control benefits./l This may be
considered as the minimum capitalized value of downstream benefits. Taking
this into account, the equalizing discount rate would be about 20%.
5.15      During negotiations, the Government agreed to prepare and furnish
to the Bank for review and comment a program for the survey, design and
construction of downstream irrigation works and implement such works in
accordance with the program.
Return on Investment
5.16      The internal rate of return of the Pattani hydroelectric project or
the discount rate at which the present worth of costs attributed to the project
is equal to that of the benefits over its life, is about 11% in constant
prices (Annex 20).
5.17      The benefit and cost streams of the downstream irrigation develop-
ment are shown in Annex 21. By adding the irrigation component, the overall
internal rate of return for the multipurpose development would be 13%.
Transmission System Expansion
5.18      A total of about 430 km of 115 kV sub-transmission lines is needed to
meet increased load demands and to support PEA's rural electrification program.
There are no other alternatives; the conductor sizes were optimized on the
basis of least-cost solutions. No separate rate of return has been esti-
mated as it is difficult to identify that portion of system revenues properly
attributable to the expansion of the parts of the transmission system involved.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Past Performance
6.01      The provisions of the Act governing EGAT's activities and the
policies followed enabled the Authority's management to maintain a sound
financial position until FY73 at which time it seemed that rising operating
and construction costs would necessitate an increase in basic average tariffs.
The fuel crisis temporarily dampened demand growth below that forecast in FY73.
Consequent postponement of capital expenditures coupled with local borrowings,
enabled EGAT to maintain its financial position without any tariff increase,
except to meet increased fuel costs, until FY77. Over the past 7 years, rates
of return on average net fixed assets in operation (not revalued) have varied
between 7.4% (FY75) and 10.1% (FY71); for FY76 the rate of return was 9.8% due
/1 Based on a cost allocation by consultants, using the acceptable "separable
cost - remaining benefit" method.



- 20 -
to abnormal rainfall increasing the water availability in EGAT's hydro-reser-
voirs, with consequent reduction in fuel oil costs for generation. Debt ser-
vice coverage on an annual basis was greater than 1.8 times in 6 out of the
past 7 years; self-financing has averaged 29 percent after covering all
operating requirements including debt service and working capital; the self-
financing covenant of 30% /1 as defined for Loan 977-TH, has been met every
year; the debt/equity ratio of 58/42 at end-FY76 was satisfactory; and a
current ratio of 1.7 /2 was adequate. Income, Funds Flow Statements and
Balance Sheets FY70-76 are shown in Annex 22. A summary of EGAT's Balance
Sheet at end FY76 is shown below:

meet the required construction program will total $ 44.8 billion /1 (US$2.2 bil-
lion) at current prices including interest during construction. EGAT plans to
borrow 63% abroad to cover foreign costs; 20% will be borrowed locally; and
17% would be self-financed on the assumption that tariffs will be fixed to
cover the resulting finance gap. The financing plan based on the foregoing is
shown as follows:

6.03      In the past EGAT has been free of taxation--exempt from corporation
tax and refunded for excise taxes by Government equity; the Bank has recom-
mended that the sector including EGAT should be subject to all forms of
taxation. The financial forecasts therefore assume that EGAT will be subject
to customs duties from the beginning of FY79 when the recommendations of the
tariff study will be implemented. Continued exemption from corporation tax is
forecast on the premise that the sector including EGAT will provide all the
support necessary for the rural electrification program from the tariff
structures; RE support and taxation may cause tariffs to rise to unacceptable
levels but the effect of taxation on sector tariffs will be addressed during
the tariff study. Given these assumptions, and the objective that EGAT would
self finance 17% of its construction expenditures, EGAT's average tariff per
kwh is forecast to increase:
- 28% from August 1, 1977;
- 15% for FY80;
- 2% for FY81;
- 5% for FY82; and
- 5% for FY83.
/1 Total construction expenditures $ 48.2 billion (US$2.4 billion) less
$ 3.4 billion (US$166 million) for irrigation facilities included in
hydro-projects, paid for by Government.



- 22 -
Level of Self-Financing
6.04      The tariff levels forecast will permit EGAT to generate an average
of 17% of construction expenditures over the 7 years ending FY83, after
covering operating costs, debt-service and working capital. The corresponding
rates of return range from 3.4% in FY77 to 10.0% in FY80-83, calculated on re-
valued net fixed assets in operation. The agreement for Loan 977-TH provides
that EGAT make a contribution to construction of 30%./l Discussions took
place during appraisal on changing to a rate of return covenant for the pro-
posed and future loans, but the EGAT Act provides that a reasonable contri-
bution to construction be made and management does not wish any ratio that
implies "profits," as any such connotation attracts bad publicity in the
media. However, to provide a fair basis for judging EGAT's financial perform-
ance in terms of rates of return, EGAT has agreed to revalue assets each year
based on the fixed capital formation deflator used for public investment in
the RTG accounts and beginning with FY70 as the base year.
6.05      It is proposed that a contribution to construction from internal
cash generation of 15% in FY 78-79 and 20% thereafter, be earned. It is also
proposed to amend the current complicated definition of "Contribution to
Construction" to a simple form which reads:
(a) The Borrower shall from time to time take all such measures (includ-
ing without limitation, adjustments of the structure or levels of
its electricity tariffs) as shall be required to produce, for each of
its fiscal years beginning on October 1, 1978, funds from internal
sources equivalent to not less than 15% for fiscal years 1978 and
1979 and not less than 20% for fiscal year 1980 and thereafter, of
the Borrower's average capital expenditures for electricity opera-
tions for three years comprising the test year, the next preceding
year and (on the basis of estimates acceptable to the Bank) the next
following year.
(b) For the purpose of this Section:
(i) The term "funds from internal sources" means the difference
between:
(a)  The sum of gross revenues from all sources related to
electricity operations, cash consumer contributions in
aid of construction, net non-operating income, and any
other cash inflows other than funds for financing capi-
tal expenditures; and
(b)  The sum of all expenses of operation, including maint-
enance and administration (excluding depreciation and
other non-cash operating charges), interest and other
charges on debt (excluding interest financed under a
loan contract), repayment of loans (including sinking

been simplified. The contributions now proposed are equivalent to
contributions greater than 30%, based on the previous definition (see
Agreement for Loan 977-TH).

fund payments, if any), all taxes or payments in lieu
of taxes, all cash dividends and other cash outflows
other than capital expenditures related to electricity
operations; and
(ii) The term "capital expenditures" means all expenditures in-
curred on account of fixed or capital assets, including
interest charged to construction.
Future Operating Results
6.06      Energy sales are estimated to increase from 8696 Kwh in FY76 to
18,331 Gwh in FY83, an average growth rate of 11.3%. Based on the tariff
increases detailed in para 6.03, revenues are forecast to increase from
g 3.8 billion (US$0.2 billion) in FY76 to $ 12.9 billion (US$0.6 billion) in
FY83, an average growth rate of 19% per year; operating expenses after esca-
lation at about 6% per annum (except fuel /1), are forecast to grow from
% 2.9 billion (US$0.1 billion) to $ 8.9 billion (US$0.4 billion), an average
annual growth rate of 17.2%.
6.07      A downward trend from 86.6% (FY77) to 68.8% (FY83) in
the operating ratio indicates that an increasing proportion of revenues is
made available to help finance rapidly increasing construction expenditures.
6.08      EGAT's capital structure will remain satisfactory throughout the
forecast period; the debt/equity ratio will vary between 43/57 (FY77) and
56/44 (FY83), a satisfactory position.
6.09      The current ratio has varied in the past between 1.3 (FY70) and
1.7 (FY76). Consumers receivables at end-FY76 were about 2.6 months billings,
which is high for a bulk power supplier. However, EGAT's contracts with
MEA and PEA provide for extended payment over about 2 months; energy receiv-
ables have been forecast at 3 months billing. Inventory levels are about
2.0% of gross plant and have been forecast at this level through FY83;
payables have been forecast at about 40% of operating expenditures ex-
cluding depreciation, the end-FY76 level; year-end cash balances are adequate
throughout the period of the forecast; the current ratio excluding current
maturities, averages about 2.0, a satisfactory position. Estimated Income,
Funds Flow Statements and Balance Sheets FY77-83 are shown in Annex 23.
11 Fuel costs have been forecast at g 1.66 per liter, the 1977 price.
Any increase in fuel prices thereafter would be dealt with by the fuel
adjustment clause.

Debt Control
6.10      Debt service coverage on an annual basis varies between 1.3 (FY77)
and 2.5 (FY81), which is satisfactory. The latest loan agreement (Loan 977-TH)
provides that EGAT cannot undertake any project costing US$50 million equiva-
lent or more without the Bank having agreed to the financing plan covering
the project. This covenant was agreed in 1974 before the full effect of
inflation following the fuel crisis had been appreciated; given the mag-
nitude of annual inflation since then, absolute number limits are no longer
appropriate; inflation and the scale of EGAT's operations have increased
each project's cost to a figure greater than US$50 million; and the Bank
would require to be approached for every project to be undertaken by EGAT.
This is unnecessary as the management of EGAT is able and conservative in its
financial policies. What is needed in the circumstances is a covenant which
would give adequate freedom to EGAT to manage its debt while providing for
Bank review of borrowings when debt reaches a level that might prejudice the
future of the Authority. The proposed loan agreement therefore contains a
covenant that the Bank need only agree to the incurrence of any loan including
medium term loans, when the debt/equity ratio exceeds 60/40.
6.11      Short-term debt, defined as obligations maturing within 5 years,
was limited by the agreement for Loan 977-TH to an aggregate amount of US$50
million equivalent. The limit is now outdated because of inflation over the
past few years and EGAT's ever-expanding scale of operations. It was therefore
agreed that unless the Bank agrees otherwise medium-term debt be limited in
the aggregate to a maximum of 15% of total debt. This figure will vary from
a 1,511 million (US$74 million) for FY77 to % 5,998 million (US$293 million)
in FY83. MIedium-term debt is defined as obligations which when issued mature
within 5 years, as EGAT has been raising its local borrowings in the form of
5-year bonds and is prohibited by Government regulations from incurring bank
overdrafts.
Receivables
6.12      EGAT's receivables at end-FY76 were about 2.6 months outstanding
mainly due to IEA being slightly in arrears in paying their EGAT bills due to
their being short of cash. EGAT's contracts with MEA and PEA allow for pay-
ments by installments over about 2 months, after receipt of each month's bill
--a long period for a supplier of bulk power. The supply contracts cannot
be amended without negotiations between EGAT, HEA and PEA. The effect on
tariffs of the lengthy outstanding period will be considered during the tariff
study with a view to amending the supply contracts.

Interest During Construction
6.13      EGAT's policy is to capitalize during the construction period
interest charges on loans taken up for a construction program (IDC); the
1977-83 financing plan (see para 6.02) includes the capitalization of interest
amounting to 9 5271 (US$257) million on loans of 9 37.2 (US$1.81) billion to
be taken up over that period. The capitalized interest includes $ 197
(US$9.6) million for interest on the proposed US$50 million Bank loan.
6.14      The execution of the sizable development program will require
EGAT to mobilize all its available liquid resources and in order to meet
the financial requirements over the construction period, EGAT is requesting
all lenders to add IDC to their loans. In support of this request the
financial forecasts indicate that even with the proposed tariff increases
(see para. 6.03) EGAT would not have the liquid resources to meet, in
addition to operational and program requirements, the interest during
construction on the loans for the program. The figures given below are
indicative of the situation.

lb   One month's cash operating expenses and debt service (excluding IDC)
and 5% of the construction program.
The timing and size of EGAT's investment program is reasonable. The single
investment decision which might affect the IDC computation above (for 1980
and thereafter) would be a change in the timing and size of the 600 MW plant
to be commissioned in FY 85 (see para 5.05); however, any reduction in IDC
arising from this decision would still not enable EGAT to pay IDC relating
to the loans taken up for the program. The large shortfall is therefore a
justification for the inclusion of IDC in the Bank loan.

ELECTRICITY GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
PATTANI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
TARIFF STUDY - TERMS OF REFERENCE
General
Before decisions on policy can be taken by Government, the costs
of supplying and distributing electric power should be known so that the
consequences of any decisions made by the Government and EGAT are revealed.
Objective
The purpose of the study should be to derive a tariff structure
which reflects as closely as possible the costs to the economy of meeting
the demand for electricity, subject to any constraints imposed by the
revenue requirements necessary to meet sector financial objectives and
by any income distribution objectives (e.g., subsidizing poor consumers)
which the electricity tariffs may be required to serve.
Analysis of Costs
(a) The relevant costs are not the financial costs to EGAT, MEA and
PEA of expanding and operating their systems to meet the demand, but the
incremental costs to the economy. Strictly speaking, therefore, shadow
prices (for capital, labor and foreign exchange) rather than actual prices
should be used as appropriate for measuring costs and any taxes on sector
inputs should be deducted and subsidies added back. In this case, however,
exclusion of taxes and subsidies from the costs already available within
the sector will suffice, although it is suggested that the opportunity cost
of capital should be taken as 14 percent.
(b) The first step would be to analyze the marginal costs of generating,
transmitting and distributing electricity at different places, times and
voltage levels to different consumers over the next few years, defined for
this purpose as the period 1977-83. Due attention would be required to the
daily and seasonal variations in forecast system demand, and to the extent
possible, in forecast demands of various consumer classes. The basis for the
estimates of marginal costs would be the development program for the period
1977-83 at constant prices, the proposed operating regime and proposals
for subsequent expansion, all of which formed the basis of the forecasts used
by the appraisal mission for the Pattani and ARE projects.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
(c) For time periods when demand does not come up against the system
capacity constraint (allowing for the reserve margins to maintain security of
supply already agreed), marginal costs would be simply marginal costs grossed
up to allow for losses at the different voltage levels. The relevant losses
are incremental losses, even if they can be estimated only approximately,
not average losses.
(d) At periods when an increase in generation would bring the system
up against the security constraint, the marginal cost of meeting demand would
be the addition to all system costs resulting from adding to generation
capacity and/or storage, transmission and distribution, in order to provide
the increased supply with an unchanged probability of failure.
(e) Incremental costs attributable to poor power factors should also
be studied for those types of consumer (the larger ones) who can be expected
to improve their power factor in response to suitable tariff incentives. The
most important cost is the extra MVA capacity required to cater for these
poor power factors.
Existing Tariffs
(f) The next step would be to examine the existing tariff structures
and compare them with the structure of marginal costs of supply derived from
the foregoing analysis. Large differences between the two may be an indication
that the existing system is giving the wrong price signals to consumers. Exa-
mination of the existing system should pay particular attention to what types
of tariffs are feasible. Other features to look for in examining the existing
system are whether it is difficult to administer, conducive to disputes or
conducive to fraud, since these will provide useful pointers to improvement in
devising the new tariff structure.
(g) Examination of existing tariff structures would embrace the current
levels of consumers contributions and whether the criteria used to assess these
contributions is appropriate in view of the launching of the accelerated rural
electrification program. All forms of consumer contributions should be studied
including village contributions, charges for connection including housewiring,
payments for service lines and security deposits.
New Tariff Proposals
(h) With the information thus collected, it should be possible to make
a first set of proposals for changing the existing tariff system so that the
incentives (and disincentives) it provides to consumers correspond more
closely to the schedule of marginal costs derived. These proposals would
consist of a classification of consumers and a tariff (or set of tariffs)
for each class, together with any connection charges for reactive power
which can be justified. Both Government and the authorities are then in a
position to decide the tariff policies to be adopted. The tariffs can then
be modified to take account of these policies and the following:



ANNEX 4
Page 3
(i) Any strong arguments for slanting electricity tariffs
because of price distortions (e.g., of substitutes for
public electricity supply) elsewhere in the economy which
are likely to affect electricity sales in the absence of
such slanting;
(ii) The desirability of the three power authorities paying
taxation on the same basis as any other commmercial
entity;
(iii) The need for EGAT, MEA and PEA collectively, and private
franchises individually, to generate sufficient funds to
meet the demands in their areas without Government assist-
ance. This would generally mean raising those elements
of the proposed tariffs where price elasticity of demand
is least, if the revenues based on marginal cost pricing
are insufficient. Rates of return and contributions to
construction levels should be considered within the
study and should generally be fixed at levels which will
provide revenues sufficient to cover:
-     operating costs;
-     debt and equity servicing;
-     working capital requirements;
-     a contribution to construction costs
sufficient to bridge any gap between
construction costs and possible consumers
contributions, borrowings and additional
equity.
(iv) Any income redistribution objectives to which elec-
tricity tariffs may be required to contribute in
Thailand; and
(v) Practicality and cost. There is a trade-off between the
cost of administering any tariff structure (which largely
depends on the cost of metering and billing) and the
extent to which it can reflect the structure of marginal
costs. Complex metering, for example, is likely to be
worthwhile only for larger consumers, since the response
of small consumers to the extra incentives (or disincen-
tives) it offers would not justify the expense.
(i) Modification of the strict "marginal cost" tariffs should be designed
to cause the least possible disturbance to the incentives they offer to con-
sumers in relation to the cost of supplying them.
(j) The new tariff schedules should provide for the automatic adjustment
of rates in the event of increases in the price of fuel for thermal and diesel
plants. The price level at which the fuel adjustment comes into effect should
be defined.



ANNEX 4
Page 4
(k) The tariff schedule should be a single set of tariffs for applica-
tion to consumers of both MEA and PEA. Accordingly, recommendations should be
made on the manner of passing to PEA the surplus funds accruing to MEA aris-
ing from the use of tariffs based on the overall cost of supply in both the
provincial and metropolitan Bangkok areas. The study should also recommend
the tariffs to be charged MEA, PEA and large industrial consumers by EGAT.

THAILAND
ELECTRICITY GENERATING AUTHORITY OF THAILAND
PATTANI HYDRO-ELECTRIC PROJECT
PROJECT DESCRIPTION
General
1.        The Pattani River is located in the districts of Pattani and Yala,
in the extreme south of Peninsular Thailand, adjacent to Malaysia.  The general
topography of the Peninsula is rolling to mountainous, with relatively small
areas of flat land, except for the Suratthani and Songkhla plains on the
eastern side. The Tenasserim mountain range divides the Peninsula from north
to south. Most of the streams fall steeply and produce flash floods during
periods of heavy rain.
2.        The Pattani is one of the major rivers on the Peninsula's eastern
slope.  It rises in the mountains near the Malaysian border and flows north-
ward for about 210 km through the Yala and Pattani districts to the Gulf of
Thailand at the city of Pattani. The Pattani River basin can be described as
mountainous upstream of the city of Yala, and as coastal plain from Yala to
Pattani. The gradient above Yala averages 0.002, decreases abruptly at Yala
to 0.00025 and flattens dowmsteam to the Gulf of Thailand at Pattani.
The Project
3.        The proposed Project consists of a storage dam, a power plant and
irrigation outlet, and associated transmission line and switchyard facilities.
The storage dam, located slightly upstream of Ban Rang and downstream of the
confluence of the Pattani and Hala rivers, is a rockfill type about 85 m high.
Appurtenant facilities include two concrete-lined diversion tunnels, a chute
spillway, a combined intake structure and conduit for power and irrigation
releases. The power plant will be of the surface type, with three 20 MW
units. The irrigation outlet will provide for release of irrigation water
when power flows are insufficient. The transmission line of 115 kV will
extend from the power plant switchyard to the substation at Yala about 40 km
distant.
4.        The Royal Irrigation Department has begun construction of irriga-
tion and flood control works about 55 km downstream of the Pattani dam to
take advantage of flow regulation provided by the reservoir. Annex 21 contains
a description of the works and preliminary estimates of costs and benefits.



ANNEX 9
Page 2
Dam
5.        The dam to be built will be a rockfill structure with an impervious
core, about 85 m in height and with a crest length of about 422 m. The crest
elevation is 120 m with a normal full supply level of 115.0 m, a freeboard of
5 m. The total embamkment of the dam has an estimated volume of about 2.9
million cu m .
6.        According to geological investigations it was found that the founda-
tion rock at the dam site varies radically over the area. There are shales
which would be subject to high deflection under heavy, concentrated loading,
and quartzites which would be relatively insensitive to loading. Most of the
rock is badly sheared and fractured, and there are many offsets in layers
caused by faulting. Because of these factors, it was considered that a con-
crete dam would involve unacceptable risks. However, a rockfill dam --the
base of which covers a wide area -- does not need the bearing strength required
for a concrete dam and can be safely built provided that adequate precautions
are taken.
7.        The section and composition of the dam embankment, with a 2:1
upstream slope and a 1.8:1 downstream slope, will make full utilization
of suitable materials generated from excavation, or made available from
borrowpits or quarries within economical haul distances.
Spillway
8.        The spillway of an open-channel chute type, will be located near
the right abutment to take advantage of the most favorable prevailing founda-
tion conditions. The complete spillway system includes the approach channel,
an ogee-shaped intake structure, two radial type regulating gates (12.5 m x
17.5 m), gate hoists, a bridge located at dam crest elevation, a chute flip
bucket, stilling basin and exit channel. The maximum spillway design capacity
of 4600 cu m/sec has been determined from the predicted probable maximum flood.
(see Annex 14).
Intake Structure
9.        The intake will be built in a combined structure with the spill-
way. It will be provided with a semicircular trashrack and controlled by
a fixed wheel type service gate. It will be designed for a minimum operating
level of El. 83 m.
Power Conduit
10.       The power conduit will be a welded steel pipe embedded in con-
crete.  It will be 6.0 m in inside diameter with a total length of 183 m.



ANNEX 9
Page 3
Powerhouse and Switchyard
11.       The powerhouse consisting of the main machine room, control room,
repair workshop, stores and station service unit is a conventional reinforced
concrete structure about 26 m high, 14 m wide and 50 m long.
12.       The switchyard is located on the southeast side of the powerhouse.
Generating Equipment
13.       The turbines are vertical shaft Francis units each of 25,000 hp
operating at 214.3 rpm and with a discharge of 45 cu m/sec at the rated head
of 47 m.
14.       The generators will be of a vertical shaft, umbrella type installed
in a concrete barrel. Unit capacity is 23,500 KVA and the frequency is
50 cycles.
15.       The transformers will be outdoor, three-phase, oil immersed with
forced air cooling each of 27000 KVA capacity. Low voltage will be 13.2 kV
whereas high voltage, 115 kV.
Transmission Line
16.       The transmission line from the switchyard to the Yala substation
will be 2 circuits of 115 kV, having a total length of 40 km. Steel tower
construction will be used.
Implementation Schedule
17.       The construction period will be approximately 4-1/2 years.  The
implementation schedule is outlined in Annex 13. It is anticipated that the
contract for civil works would be awarded in September 1977. During calendar
1978 the principal activity will be concentrated on preliminary works and
excavation of two diversion tunnels. By early 1979, it would be possible to
divert the river. At the same time excavation for the dam will proceed as will
excavation for the spillway, intake and power conduit. The fill for the main
dam is expected to be started in mid-1979 and completed by early 1981. Reservoir
impounding would commence in September 1980. Tenders for electromechanical
equipment would be issued by mid-1977 and contracts awarded by early 1978.
Erection of units would start in mid-1980 and commissioning is expected by
mid-1981, September 1981 and end-1981 respectively.

HYDROLOGY
Climate
1.        The Pattani River Basin is located at the southernmost tip of the
Peninsular Region of Thailand. The climate is tropical and seasons result
from two major air movement systems, the northEAst and the southwest monsoons,
each with its own weather characteristics. The northeast monsoon season is
associated with the Northern Hemisphere winter and extends from October
through January. During this period, the Peninsular Region is hot and humid,
and rainfall is heavier and more frequent, while other parts of Thailand are
comparatively cool and almost rainless. The southwest monsoon and the tran-
sition period bring lesser rainfall to the Peninsular area than the north-
east monsoon. Unlike the major portion of Thailand, the Peninsular Region
has no protective barrier to the east. Available records indicate that no
storms of full typhoon intensity reach the area, however, tropical depres-
sions and occasional tropical storms do cross the the Peninsula, bring-
ing with them large volume and high intensity rainfall.
2.        The monthly mean temperature at Pattani varies from about 26.1 C in
December to about 28.4 C in May; and the extreme temperatures range from a
minimum of 190C to a maximum of 38 0C. The mean relative humidity ranges
from about 77 percent in January to about 84 percent in November.
3.        Average annual rainfall varies from 1700 to 2400 mm over the
basin. The average annual runoff at the damsite, embracing a catchment area
of 2080 sq km, is estimated to be 46 cu m/sec or approximately 1,450 mil-
lion cu m.
Hydrological Records
4.        There are 14 rainfall and 5 stream flow gauging stations in the
Pattani River basin. The duration of records and sponsoring agencies are
summarized below:

River Runoff
5.        Therefore, there were only twelve years of flow records at the dam
site by the time of the last feasibility study in 1974 and 15 years up to
present. It was necessary to extend the runoff records by correlation with
rainfall. An analysis of the available rainfall records led to the selec-
tion of two periods, 1922-1958 and 1952-1965, as the basis of study. The
double mass curve method was used to correlate rainfall with runoff, and to
obtain the long-term monthly runoff at the dam site:

6.        Two methods were used in estimating the design floods, statistical
and physical.
7.        Statistical:
The annual flood peaks from 1962 through 1975 arranged in descend-
ing order were:

110                             1968
The results of the frequency analysis of annual flood peaks for various
return periods were as follows:

10000                             6114
A design flood corresponding to a return period of 30 years or about 2100
cms was adopted for the design of the diversion tunnel.  In view of the short
duration of flow records and a recorded flood of 2075 cu m/sec, this seems
reasonable.
8.        Physical:
The highest recorded storm in the southernmost region of Thailand
and in the adjacent Kelantan state of West Malaysia occurred in the first
week of January 1967. The center of this storm was Kota Bharu, where a
total rainfall of 1319.7 mm was recorded for the period. This storm was
first maximized by dew point temperature adjustment, then translocated
to the project area by making further adjustments for the elevation dif-
ference.
Maximizing factor   1.076
Maximized rainfall = 1419.2 mm
Maximized point rainfall for the project
area = 0.85 x 1419.2 = 1206.4 mm
(Adjustment for distance from the source of moisture)
MIaximized average basin rainfall = 0.83 x 1206.4 =1001.7 mm
This maximized storm was distributed over five days according to the pattern
observed during the storm of January 1967. An amount of 5 mm per day was sub-
tracted to account for the base flow of 100 cms and a runoff coefficient of
80% was adopted to calculate the effective rainfall. Basic unit hydrographs
of past floods were developed out of seven storms chosen for anaysis. A
24-hour unit storm of 10 mm and unit hydrograph similar to the December 18,
1962 storm was adopted. The results of the studies were as follows:



ANNEX 14
Page 5
Probable maximum flood                 6734 cu m/sec
Probable maximum flood volume          1810 million cu m
Maximum spillway discharge             4600 cu m/sec
Maximum reservoir elevation
at extreme flood                      117.73 m
Freeboard available                       2.27 m
Operation under Abnormal Condition
9.        Assuming that one of the spillway gates does not function properly
under the condition of a 1000-year flood of about 4400 cu m/sec, the reservoir
will rise up to elevation 117.5 - 117.8 m depending upon the design of river
outlet. The remaining freeboard will still be adequate to take care of wave
action.
Reservoir Sedimentation
10.       Based on the suspended sediment rating curve at the dam site, annual
suspended load is estimated at about 500,000 tons/year, after allowing an
additional 20% for bed load. The dead storage of 210 million cu m is adequate
to take care of the sediment inflow over the life of the project.

GEOLOGY
Reservoir Geology
1.        The bedrocks in the reservoir area consist of quartzite, sandstone,
shale, limestone and minor granitic and gnessic type rocks. Formations in
which these rocks occur range in age from Cambrian to late Cretaceous, with
the crystalline rock being the youngest. As a result, the limestone forma-
tion is located at high elevation above the reservoir levels, no reservoir
leakage is expected.
2.        The regional strike of the rock units in the reservoir area is
to the north or northeast. The dip is to the west and northwest. This
trend can be followed all the way to the crest of the regional folding
located south of Betong (45 km in air distance south of the damsite).
Upon crossing the border into Malaysia the rock units can be seen to dip
to the west - southwest. Superimposed on the regional fold pattern are
numerous local moderate to tight folds.
3.        No extensive fault systems have been mapped in Southern Thailand.
A study of the aerial photographs of the reservoir suggests an extensive
fault-like feature of i to 3 km east and nearly parallel to the Pattani
and Hala Rivers. There are many local faults within the damsite, and this
prevalence should be considered normal for the entire region. The slope
of banks is rather gentle and vegetation coverage extremely good. No
massive slides are expected. However, bank erosion during the reservoir draw-
down period is possible. A field survey for detecting slide areas should be
carried out and proper measures be undertaken before impounding.
4.        Four prominent joint systems have been mapped.  Three of them
appear to have quite an extensive distribution. Similar joint orientations
have been mapped up to 10 km from dam site.
Damsite Geology
5.        The rock underlying the damsite is of three major types:  quartzite,
sandstone and shale. These lie in beds of varying thickness and are modified
by metamorphism and weathering, with the quartzite being the most intensively



ANNEX 15
Page 2
metamorphised, and the hardest of the three. The sandstone is slightly
coarser than the quartzite and has been leached to depths as great as 10 centi-
meters. It is not as hard as the quartzite and grades into the quartzite or
the shales without distinct bedding planes. The shale is the least competent
of the three rock types, having been sheared and deformed. These major rock
members lie in various positions on each side of the damsite, reflecting the
presence of folding and faulting.
6.        The damsite area encompasses approximately 0.4 square km, and is
bisected by the Pattani River. The rock on the right abutment generally
strikes N 400 to 500 W and dips 450 to 550 NE. The rock on the left abut-
ment strikes about N 650 E and dips generally 200 NW.  The fault is nearly
vertical or dips at a high angle to the northeast. Associated with this
fault and nearly perpendicular to it are a series of normal faults.
7.        There are primary and secondary joint systems in the foundation
rock. The primary system is traceable for a considerable distance, but
the secondary joints are localized. These have been filled, in part,
with various natural cementing agents and sand, but many of them are par-
tially open. Water losses during drilling varied, depending on the degree
of filling of joints. The most prominent joint sets have the following
attitudes:  strike N 700 W, dip 500 to 700 SW; strike N 590 W, dip 700 NE;
strike N 16  W, dip 60  NE and 70  SW.  Dips of exposed joint surfaces vary
extensively.  Secondary joint attitudes are:  strike N 600 to 700 E, dip
140 NW and about N 400 E, vertical to dipping about 500 SE.  Most of the
joints seen on the surface were open, some gapping up to one centimeter.
Joint sets found in the rock cores were in varying stages of closure. Some
were unfilled, some filled with sand, and some filled with cementing media
such as iron oxide, manganese oxide, pyrite, or silica.
8.        49 wash borings, combined with previous drilling (39 holes) and
test pits (93) indicated that overburden thicknesses are rather shallow
beneath the upstream cofferdam site (less than 5 m) and the main dam foun-
dation (3 to 10 m). The bedrock surface in the channel deepens abruptly
downstream of the dam. This deepening coincides with a shear zone that
obliquely crosses the channel in the tailrace area. the river has gouged
out the easily eroded shales, clays, and broken rock within the shear zone,
degrading the bedrock floor of the valley correspondingly. Subsequent drill
hole data indicated that rock underneath the downstream toe of the dam is
firm quartzite, thus stability of the dam itself would not be adversely
affected by the shear zone. The alluvium underneath the downstream cofferdam
area is about 20 m deep, thus a cut-off, possibly a slurry trench or cellular
steel cofferdam, would be necessary.



ANNEX 15
Page 3
9.        The entire area underlying the main dam foundation will be stripped
and cleared to a sound rock surface by removing all top soil, alluvial depos-
its, weathered and decomposed rock. In fractured, or faulted zones, all
deleterious materials will be removed and backfilled with concrete. Special
care will be taken in the foundation area underlying the impervious core of
the dam to provide a sound, acceptable surface of contact. Consolidation and
curtain grouting will be applied.
Spillway
10.       Quartzites generally underlie the spillway crest structure and
upper chute section whereas sandstones, shales and lenses of quartzites are
found in the lower chute section and flip bucket area. A major fault trends
roughly normal to the spillway chute about 40 m upstream of the flip bucket.
Rock in the vicinity of the transverse fault will be highly fractured and
deeply weathered but should provide an adequate base for the concrete lining.
Drains and tie-down anchors should be provided to prevent uplift.
Power Conduit
11.       Quartzite is the primary rock to be encountered throughout the area
and is highly fractured and contains many small shear zones. Support will be
required for the length of the tunnel. Ground water will not be a problem as
the ground water table appears to lie below the invert of the power conduit.
Penstock
12.       A major fault structure crosses the penstock alignment at an acute
angle near the downstream edge of the anchor block. Between the power con-
duit and the anchor block, the penstock will be found on hard, fractured
quartzites. Rock quality degenerates abruptly downstream from the anchor
block. It would be advisable to move the anchor block slightly upstream to
found the structure entirely on firm quartzites.
Powerhouse
13.       Nine holes were drilled in the powerhouse area.  Owing to the com-
plex geological structure and the difficult drilling conditions which resulted
in poor recovery, the foundation conditions are still not well defined. One
of the major faults in the damsite area transverses the powerhouse site.
Approximately 60 percent of the material to be removed is expected to be
quartzite and quartzitic sandstone. The middle of the powerhouse will be
resting on relatively soft shales and fractured rock. The quartzites are
hard, but closely jointed and fractured, and should be capable of sustaining
pressures well in excess of 60,000 psf. The shale and shear zones will have
a lower supporting capacity but still adequate to support the powerhouse.
They should be protected from further deterioration with gunite immediately
after exposure.

Conclusions
14.       The foundation exploration for the project was carried out in
several stages: first by the Electric Power Development Company of Japan
consisting of 18 drill holes, 36 test pits, 3 adits, and 2 trenches; then by
Royal Irrigation Department consisting of 21 drill holes (1119 m in total)
and 57 test pits; and finally by EGAT consisting of 49 wash holes and 15 drill
holes (764 m in total).
15.       EGAT is now carrying out a pilot tunnel of 2.5 x 2.5   along the
whole length of Diversion Tunnel No. 1 and surface stripping at both abut-
ments of the dam in order to provide additional information for detailed
design.

THE LEAST COST SOLUTION
Alternatives to the Project
1.        The least cost analysis was made on a program basis.  Before 1981,
there is no other alternative but to add gas turbines of 15 MW each in 1977
and 1978 respectively and a 132 KV tie line of 40 MW capacity in 1979.
The Lang Suan hydroelectric project located in the northern part of Region 3
is still in the investigation stage and cannot be completed before 1983.
2.        Two programs were chosen for comparison:
Program A              Program B
(Early Pattani)         (Late Pattani)
1981                Pattani              Thermal, oil-fired
(3 x 20 MW)            (I x 30 MW)
1983              Thermal, oil fired      Pattani
( x 30 MW)              (3 x 20 MW)
Each program was designed to meet the projected system demand with a reserve
capacity of the largest unit in operation or loss of the tie line.
Capital Cost
3.        All costs were based on end-1976 price level.  Price contingen-
cies were not included. Shadow prices were used as follows: (i) taxes and
duties were excluded; (ii) foreign exchange costs were shadow priced by
a factor of 1.1; (iii) local costs were adjusted by shadow pricing: the
Pattani project at a factor of 0.85, made up of the labor content of the local
cost estimate (30%) shadow priced at 0.5 plus the 70% of local costs remain-
ing (30% x 0.5 + 70% = 0.85); and the thermal alternative at a factor of 0.95,
made up of the labor content of the local cost estimate (10%) shadow priced
at 0.5 plus the 90% of local costs remaining (10% x 0.5 + 90% = 0.95).
4.        The cost of Pattani used for the discounted cash flow analysis is
shown below with its phasing.

10.       The equalizing discount rate between Program A and Program B is
12%. Program A with early Pattani is therefore the least cost solution
for discount rates up to 12%, even after allocating all the costs of common
facilities to power.

PATTANI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
Irrigation and Flood Control
Introduction
1.        The Pattani Reservoir would create a potential for year-round
irrigation of about 60,000 ha in the lower reaches of the Pattani River. The
reservoir, although not specifically operated for flood control, has an
effective storage of about 70% of the average annual inflow and would inter-
cept a large volume of the monsoon runoff and thereby reduce considerably the
magnitude and frequency of floods downstream of the dam.
Status of Irrigation
2.        Proposals for irrigation development in the Pattani River Basin
were presented in a 1969 feasibility report prepared by Sverdrup and Parcel
International, Inc. (SPI) for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID), the agency
responsible for all large-scale irrigation projects in Thailand. The study
was updated in 1977 by SPI, assisted by Frederiksen, Kamine and Associate;.
RID has recently started construction of a diversion dam to serve a Stage I
development of 41,500 ha. The diversion dam is about 55 km downstream
from the proposed hydroelectric project. Other works constructed to date
include the upper part of one of the main canals and about 40 km of main
drains. However, the topographic surveys and detailed engineering of the
project works have yet to be carried out and a firm timetable for the imple-
mentation of the ptoject has so far not been prepared.
3.        In 1976, a Bank mission reviewed the present status and future
outlook for irrigation development in Thailand at the request of the Govern-
ment. The mission's report /1 identified certain problems encountered in
recent years in project implementation.  In general, projects are constructed
over too long a period of time and with more emphasis on major works such as
dams and main canals, than on the tertiary systems needed to provide the
farmers with a timely and reliable water supply.
4.        To overcome these problems, the report recommended improvements in
planning and programming with particular emphasis on preparation of implemen-
tation schedules. A typical schedule should specify all of the activities
needed to achieve a working irrigation system, such as surveys, designs,
construction of main canals, laterals, service roads, etc., on-farm develop-
ment, and the establishment of effective operation and maintenance. Time-
tables should be prepared covering all major preconstruction activities which
also identify the issues which remain to be resolved. Improved planning and
/1 "Thailand, Irrigation Program Review," Report No. 1397A-TH, December 1976.



ANNEX 21
Page 2
programming should also be combined with a system of regular progress report-
ing. This would help RID's management to overcome the delays sometimes
experienced in project completion and the realization of project benefits.
These recommendations should be adopted by RID in implementing the Pattani
Project to ensure that the considerable irrigation potential created by the
hydroelectric project are to be realized without delay.
The Project Area
5.        The Stage I project has a gross area of 46,000 ha (41,500 ha net
irrigable) in the shape of a triangle with its apex at the diversion dam and
its base along the coast of the Gulf of Thailand. Virtually all of the
project area is presently devoted to a single paddy crop grown during the
wet season (September-January). Rainfall in the dry season is not enough
to allow cultivation of field crops without irrigation. Paddy yields
average about 1.5 ton/ha. Some improvement in rainfed rice yields would
be possible with improved cultural practices and the use of good quality
seeds, but the potential for higher yields is limited by droughts, in
September and January, and floods in November/December. The higher land
surrounding the project area is planted to rubber and numerous small plots
of fruit and vegetables. The average farm holding in the project area
is about 1.6 ha and most of the farmers own approximately an equal area
of land planted to rubber and other crops. Virtually all the farmers own
their land. The road system is adequate within the project area and is
linked by paved roads to the nearby province capitals of Pattani and Yala.
Project Works and Cost Estimates
6.        The principal features of the project are:
(a) a diversion dam consisting of a service spillway with seven
6 m wide radial gates, and an emergency spillway with a 1,600 m
long overflow weir;
(b)  three main canals with a combined length of 90 km;
(c)  lateral canals with a total length of 570 km;
(d) on-farm development on 41,500 ha consisting of tertiary canals,
drains and farm roads;
(e) about 150 km of main drains and 365 km of secondary drains and
flood control works; and
(f) flood control works comprising about 30 km of flood embankments
upstream of the diversion dam and 10 km of channel improvement in
the lower reaches of the project area.
The estimated cost of the project, in January 1978 prices, is summarized
below. Civil works costs, except for on-farm development, are taken from
the 1977 update of the Feasibility Report (para. 2) and have been increased



ANNEX 21
Page 3
by 10% to bring them to January 1978. On-farm development costs are based
on a unit cost of $350/ha in line with recent contracts for similar work in
Thailand. Engineering and administration, and physical contingencies are
10% and 15% of civil works costs respectively.
Cost Summary
US$ million
Diversion dam                                          7.9
Canals and laterals                                  22.2
On-farm development                                   14.5
Drains                                                10.1
Flood control                                          8.1
Engineering and administration                         6.2
Base cost estimate                              69.0
Physical contingencies                                9.4
Expected price increases                              27.6
Total cost                                     106.0
Economic Justification
7.        The provision of year-round irrigation coupled with reduction in
flooding would permit the farmers to grow a double crop of rice. With
projected paddy yields of 3.5 ton/ha and 4 ton/ha in the wet and dry seasons
respectively and assuming an annual cropping intensity at full development
of 170% (100% in the wet season and 70% in the dry season), paddy production
would increase from 60,000 tons at present to 260,000 tons at full development
seven years after completion of the project. The estimated rate of return is
about 16% (see Table 1).
