PATTANI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT (LOAN 1485-TH)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Preface
This is the Completion Report for the project financed under the
fourth power loan to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT)
and the eighth one to EGAT and its predecessor. The US$50 million loan which
became effective on December 20, 1977, was provided to finance approximately
60% of the foreign cost of a project consisting of a hydroelectric scheme at
Pattani in the Southern Region, several 115 KV transmission extensions and a
long-run marginal cost tariff study. Additional finance was provided by loans
from the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development (US$20 million equivalent)
and commercial banks (also US$20 million equivalent). The project was
completed at a cost of about 3% below estimates (project cost plus interest
during construction) and an unaisbursed balance of US$1.84-million of the Bank
loan was cancelled.
This report was prepared by the East Asia and Pacific Projects
Department, Energy Division following a project completion mission which took
place in March 1984; a first draft of the report had been prepared by the
Hydroelectric Construction Department of EGAT.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance
audit reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department
COED) but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft report
to EGAT, the Government and the Kuwait Fund for their comments. Comments
received from EGAT and the Government have been reproduced as Appendices A,
B and C to the report.

PATTANI HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT (LOAN 1485-TH)
PROJECT COIIPLETION REPORT
Highlights
A US$50 million loan was made to EGAT in September 1977 to
finance part of the foreign costs of constructing the Pattani hydro-
electric dam and power station located in the Southern Region of
Thailand, system expansions in the Northern, Northeastern and Southern
areas of EGAT's 115 kV network and a sector tariff study (para. 10).
The Pattani power station, with total installed capacity of 72 MW
in three units, was commissioned two months ahead of schedule and was
generating commercially before the end of 1981 (paras. 31 and 52).
The resettlement program and the establishment of an agricultural
cooperative society included in this project were also successfully
completed on time (paras. 18 and 51). The network expansions were
completed but generally behind schedule (paras. 19, 22 and 53).
The actual project cost was about US$133.5 million equivalent, or
some 8% below the appraisal estimate of US$144.6 million. The loan
was reduced to about US$48.2 million as a result of lower than esti-
mated project foreign cost (paras. 23, 24 and 26).
The load growth in the Southern Region during the years 1977
to 1983 averaged 17% per annum compared with the Appraisal forecast of
13%. The peak demand during the same period rose from 90.7 to 237.3 MI.
EGAT's countrywide sales more than doubled in the seven year period
(paras. 41-43).
The project will reduce Thailand's needs for imported fuels
and its ex-post economic rate of return of 12%, compared with the
appraisal estimate of 11%, confirms its ecanomic viability (para. 45).
EAGT continues to be well managed (para. 29). After operating
costs had been seriously affected by severe droughts in 1977 and 1979
and the oil price rises of 1979, the Government implemented substantial
tariff increases in 1980 and 1981 which subsequently helped restore
EGAT's financial viability (paras. 34-39 and 54).

I. INTRODUCTION
The Power Sector
1.        Power in Thailand is supplied principally by three government enti-
ties, the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT), the Metropoli-
tan Electricity Authority (MEA) and the Provincial Electricity Authority
(PEA). ECAT is responsible for generation and high voLtage transmissLon to
supply bulk power to MEA, PEA and a small number of large industrial consu-
mers; MEA for distribution in the greater Bangkok Mecropolitan area and PEA
for distribution throughout the rest of the country and for minor generation
in certain isolated areas.
2.        EGAT's system at the end of FY83 compares with that of FY76 at
appraisal as follows:

The Borrower
3.        The Borrower was EGAT, an autonomous entity established in 1968 by a
merger of its predecessor, the Yanhee Electricity Authority (YEA) and two
other entities. EGAT, which accounts for almost all of the electricity
generated in Thailand, is a well organized and operated utility with a
considerable degree of autonomy. Its Board of Directors consists of a Chair-
man and not more than 10 other members, including the General Manager. All
Board members who are appointed by the Council of Ministers, act in part time
capacity, with the exception of the General Manager. EGAT has four Deputy
General Managers responsible respectively for administration, technical
Matters, construction and operations.
4.        This was the fourth power loan to EGAT and the eighth to EGAT and
its predecessor. The loan for the first EGAT Power Project (Loan 655-TH) was
made in February 1970 to help finance the power installation (3 x 125 MW) at
the Sirikit dam and the addition of Unit No. 3 (300 fW) at the South Bangkok
thermal power pLant. The second loan to EGAT was made in November 1971 for
the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4 Project (Loan 790-TH). The third loan
was made in April 1974 for the first stage of the Ban Chao Nen Hydro-Electric
Project (Loan 977-TH).
5.        The conclusions of the PPAR for the first EGAT Power Project were
that (a) the Sirikit units were implemented a few months earier than envis-
aged, with a cost overrun of 4%; (b) the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 3 had
a cost overrun of 3% and was completed six months behind schedule mainly due
to the need to repair the generator; (c) the major objectives of the project
had been met; and (d) ECAT complied with all covenants and its financial
performance was satisfactory.
6.        The conclusions of the PPAR for the South Bangkok Thermal Unit No. 4
Project were that (a) the major objectives of the project had been met;
(b) the project was completed on time and within the original cost estimate;
(c) EGAT's financial performance was satisfactory; and (d) some financial
advantage resulted from exercising an option to purchase duplicate generating
equipment provided in the contract for Unit No. 3.
7.        The conclusions of the PPAR for the third project, the first stage
of the Ban Chao Nen Hydro-Electric Project were that (a) the project was
executed as planned and was completed according to the original schedule but
at a cost overrun of about 30% which was beyond the control of EGAT due to the
world fuel crisis and the resulting inflation; (b) the resettlement plan was
carried out successfully; (c) the Government succeeded in implementing tariff
increases four times; and (d) the financial position of EGAT and the Sector as
a whole was sound. The major lessons to be learned from that Project were
that an International Board of Consultants can be very effective in ensuring
adequate project design and implementation, and that an effective way to con-
serve energy is through an appropriate energy pricing policy.

II. PROJECT IDENTIFICATION AND PREPARATION
Project Preparation and Appraisal
8.        Numerous investigations for deveLoping the Pattani River Basin had
been carried out since 1963 by various government agencies with the assistance
of consultants.  The first feasibility study for the Pattani Project was com-
pleted in December 1969 by Sverdrup and Parcel and Associates, Inc., USA
(SPI), for the Royal Irrigation Department (RID). In May 1970, EGAT was
requested by the Water Resources Development Committee of the Ministry of
National Development to review the power features of the project. After
considering the power requirements in Southern Thailand, the characteristics
of the power component of the Pattani project and the fact that electricity
supply for the Southern System was based on thermal plants, EGAT concluded
that the Pattani Hydroelectric Project was technically and economically
viable. By end 1975 the Bank had been provided with copies of a report
prepared by SPI and EGAT in 1972 entitled "Pattani River Project -
Supplementary Power Study," and an Appraisal Report on the Pattani
Multipurpose Project dated January 1975.
9.        A Bank power sector mission which visited Thailand in January 1976
officially started project preparation by the Bank. The Bank appraised the
project in October 1976.
Project Description
10.       The project, officially named as Pattani Hydro-Electric Project
consisted of:
(a)  Pattani Hydroelectric Development
Ci) construction of a 2.9 million cu m and 422 m long rock-fill dam
about 85 meters high with appurtenant structures and equipment,
near Ban Bang Lang on the Pattani River, about 210 km upstream
of the city of Pattani, in Yala province near the border
with Malaysia;
*                  (ii)  construction of a reinforced concrete surface-type powerhouse
located at the foot of the dam, including the installation of
three generating units of 24 MW each, and a switchyard with
three 27 MVA transformers;
(iii) erection of 115 KV double circuit transmission line about 40 km
long between the Pattani Power Station switchyard and the Yala
substation;
(iv) execution of preliminary works in the project area and
implementation of a resettlement program for about
1,100 families in areas that would be flooded by the Pattani
reservoir, including the purchase aiid utilization of construc-
tion equipment required to carry out such works;



-4-
(b) Transmission System Expansion
Construction of a part of ECAT's transmission system expansion
program for 1977-81, specifically designed to support the rural
electrification program of PEA, comprising about 400 km of 115 KV
transmission lines and associated substations and facilities as
follows;
Northern Area
(i)  115 KV Phayso-Chiangrai line (90 km long) and terminal
substations.
Northeastern Area
(ii)  115 [V Undonthani - Loei line (140 km long) and terminal
substations;
(iii)  115 KV Phon-Chaiyaphum line (65 km long) and terminal sub-
stations;
(iv)  115 [V Ubon-Ratchathani-Sisaket line (62 km long) and terminal
substations;
(v) Buriram substation; and
(vi)  Phang Khon substation.
Southern Area
(vii)  115 KV Yala-Narathiwat line (70 km long) and terminal substa-
tions.
Communication System
(viii) Expansion of communication facilities for the above
transmission system.
(c) Tariff Stud,,
Execution of a study to determine the marginal costs of supplying
electricity to consumers at the various voltages, which would
provide a basis for the preparation of tariff schedules for the
power sector.
Projecc Role in Thailand's Development Program
11.       The project is an important part of EGAT's expansion program to meet
rapidly growing demand for electricity, particularly in Southern Thailand. By
using an indigenous renewable energy resource, the project reduces Thailand's
dependence on imported fuels for electricity generation. In addition, the
project has made available a reliable supply of water which will eventually
permit the irrigation of 60,800 ha of land in the dry season and will
facilitate flood control in the wet season. The downstream benefits will be
realized substantially when the related irrigation works are completed under
the ongoing Irrigation Project XI (Loan 1787-TH).

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Loan Effectiveness and Start-up
12.       Board approval of the Project took place on August 30, 1977.  The
loan was signed on September 23, 1977 and became effective on December 20,
1977.
13.       Project preparation and procurement for the major items were well
advanced by the date of Board approval. Bidding documents for the Pattani
civil works were issued on December 22, 1976, bids were opened on April 11,
1977 and contract award was made on October 3, 1977. Bidding documents for
generators and turbines were issued on November 1, 1977, the bids were opened
on March 1, 1978 and the contracts were signed on November 3 and 17, 1978,
respectively.
Changes in Scope of Work
14.       The project scope remained essentially the same as described in the
Appraisal Report.
(a)  Pattani Hydroelectric Development
The following modifications were made as a result of site
investigations which, though well advanced by loan approval, continued
throughout engineering development.
(i) The spillway originally planned to be located on the right
abutment of the dam, and designed to have a chute length of
200 m, was relocated and constructed in the right bank saddle
some 800 m from the dam where better rock conditions enabled
the chute length to be reduced to 100 m; and
(ii)  the design of the dam section was modified, by decreasing the
rock-fill section and increasing the transition zone, to take
advantage of the high quality rock located about 7 km from the
*                       dam site.
(b) Transmission System Expansion
Modifications in this part of the project consisted of line length
changes only.
Project Implementation
(a) Pattani Hydroelectric Development
15.       Main civil works for the dam, powerhouse and appurtenant structures
started in October 1977 and were completed in June 1981. Some remaining minor
works were completed by ECAT's own staff in December 1981. The supply and



-6-
installation of hydro-mechanical equipment including gates, hoisting equip-
ment, steel conduit and valves were executed under supply and erection con-
tracts; installation started in January 1980 and was completed in January
1981. The installation of major electro-mechanical equipment including tur-
bines, generators, crane, main transformers, power-plant auxiliary equipment
and switchyard equipment was carried out by EGAT's own personnel under the
technical supervision of the various related suppliers. A summary of key
dates for major works is included in Annex 1, Tables I and 2. The test runs
of the generating units were performed during the period June 22 to
October 31, 1981.                  A
16.       Construction and installation of the 40 km long 115 KV double-
circuit transmission line from the Pattani hydroelectric plant to Yala was
started by contractor in May 1978 and completed in September 1979 (Annex 1,
Table 3).
17.       The project was executed and continues to be operated with due
regard co ecological and environmental factors including those identified in
the recommendations of the draft report dated October 12, 1976, entitled
"Environmental and Ecological Investigation of the Pattani Multipurpose
Project." Following the closure of the dam and during the period of the
initial filling of the reservoir, the consequent reduction in the river flow
had no adverse effect on irrigation because sufficient water flow from the
lower catchment area continued downstream of the dam to maintain supplies for
riparian agriculture and domestic use.
18.       The resettlement program was carried out satisfactorily in accor-
dance with the plan submitted to the Bank in April 1978. The infrastructure
associated with the project included the construction of 30 km of asphaltic
main access road, 38 km of lateritic village road, 33 kV power supply line,
domestic water supply system, schools, health aenters, wats and mosques.
Compensation monies totaling B 131.13 million1 were paid to the affected
villagers. Of a total of 1,100 families that lived in the area flooded (about
50 sq km), 881 families were resettled in new villages constructed under the
project. Each family was provided with a 2 rai home plot and an 18 rai farm
plot. An agricultural cooperative society was established. A total amount of
about B 10 million was provided in loans to the villagers on the basis of
B 10,000 per family. Also, an agricultural promotion center was set up in the
resettlement area for extension services. Fewer families were resettled than
originally estimated because a number of families decided to relocate to
various places of their own choice after receiving due compensation.
a/ Corrected by EGAT to B139.48 million. Since this correction would not
significantly change the total project cost or the internal rates of
return of the projects, figures on pages 8, 10, 31 and 33 have not been
ammended.

(b) Transmission System Expansion
19.       The execution of the transmission system expansion including plan-
ning, design, equipment specification, procurement, erection and commissioning
was performed by ECAT's own staff, except for transmission line erection and
substation civil works which were carried out by contractors. The
implementation schedule of the transmission system expansion is at Annex 1,
Table 4.  Some of the transmission lines and substations were not commissioned
in time to supply several of the distribution networks completed under the
first Accelerated Rural Electrification Project (Loan 1527-TH) executed by PEA
(para. 10).
(c) Tariff Study
20.       A tariff study based on marginaL costs of supplying power to con-
stmers at different voltage levels was to be carried out by the Government's
Committee for Power Policy and Development (CPPD). Funds were, however,
provided under the Bank loan for employing consultants to carry out the study
if the Bank deemed it so advisable.
21.       The Government commissioned the tariff study through CPPD's Subcom-
mittee for Power Tarriff Structure Study (a Thai inter-agency group which
included EGAT, PEA and MEA), and Bank staff provided technical advice.
Accordingly, the loan funds provided for this purpose were not utilized. The
study, which was substantially completed by mid-1979, concluded that the
marginal costs of supplying power were much higher than the prevaiLing average
tariffs, and that although long-run marginal cost based tariffs were desir-
able, it would have been difficult to implement such tariffs in the short
term. The study recommended instead a series of tariff increases which were
to help improve the power sector's financial condition. It also recommended
several changes in the structure of the tariffs, e.g., increases in demand
charges, introduction of increasing energy block charges for residential
consumers, and the eliminacion of declining energy block tariffs for indus-
trial consumers. Most of the recommended changes were carried out in the
tari_f adjustments implemented since the study was completed.

Project Completion
22.       The physical items of the project were completed by December 1981 as
orginally estimated, except for the transmission line Yala-Marathiwat which
experienced right-of-way problems. This line was completed in December 1982
(Annex 1, Table 4).
Project Costs
23.       The final project cost in current prices was US$133.53 million
equivalent, of which US$49.61 million was the foreign exchange cost and
US$83.92 million equivalent the local cost. The appraisal estimate and the
actual cost of the project are compared below:

29.       EGAT continues to be well managed.  Staff are well qualified and
competent. The working climate and staff morale are excellent. The number of
employees reflects the fact that EGAT carries out most of the field investiga-
tion works required for its future projects and maintains a large construction
force for plant installation. EGAT's training program is adequate.
Reservoir Filling and Plant Operation
30.       The dam was closed and reservoir filling began on June 1, 1980,
about four months ahead of the appraisal estimate.
31.       Generating units No. 1, 2 and 3 were comissioned on July 7, August 11,
and November 1, 1981 respectively, about two months ahead of schedule. At the



- 12 -
commissioning date of generating unit No. 1, the reservoir water level had
reached the 109.5 m level (MSL) and was high enough to start commercial opera-
tion. The highest reservoir level of 113.6 m (MSL) was reached by the end of
December 1983. The reservoir statistics are shown in Annex 3 and summarized
below:

32.       In spite of the poor rainfall which occurred in the Pattani
catchment area during the period 1980-82, the total cumulative energy
generated up to the end of August 1984 was 687 GWh, or an average of 229 CWh
per year, which was about 15% more than the energy output of 200 GWh per year
assumed in the rate of return calculated at appraisal.
Instrumentation and Monitoring
33.       Instruments installed to monitor the dam behavior during construc-
tion, reservoir filling and operation included 8 pore pressure piezometers in
the impervious core zone, 5 observation wells along both abutments and 14
surface settlement reference points. Periodic monitoring of the instruments
is carried out to safeguard the dam. Operation and maintenance manuals for
the monitoring system were prepared by ECAT. Statistics of measurements from
both the observation wells and pore pressure piezometers indicate that the dam
displacements and stresses are within the normal values expected. The crest
settlement as of October 1981 (reservoir water level 101.3 m MSL), at comr
missioning of the third unit, was 0.2 m or 0.2Z of the fill height. By
December 1983, crest settlement for maximum reservoir water level attained was
0.3 m or 0.35% of the fill height which was within the expected design range.

V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
General
34.       During the period FY77 to FY83 energy sales incceased at an average
annual rate of 10.6%, compared with the appraisal forecast of 11.3%. While
during the period FY77 to FY79, energy sales grew at an average annual rate of
14.1%, the sales growth had slowed down dramatically to an annual rate of 6.0%
during the three-year period FY80-82. This slowdown in sales growth occurred
mainly in response to substantial increases in electricity tariffs, and due to
slower economic growth during the same period compared to the Later 1970s.
However, energy sales in FY83 increased 14.2% compared to FY82, reflecting
largely an upturn in the country's economy.
35.       Severe droughts in 1977 and 1979 affected hydro generation, forcing
EGAT to increase thermal generation, with corresponding increases in operating
costs. The situation further deteriorated as fuel costs increased sharpLy in
1979 and EGAT was not permitted to implement adequate tariff increases. In
FY80, EGAT experienced operating losses for the first time. To help ECAT
solve its liquidity problems, the Government implemented several tariff
increases which helped restore EGAT's financial health (para. 37).
36.       EGAT's comparative income statements, balance sheets, funds flow
statements and key financial indicators are presented in Annex 4.
Financial Covenants and Operating Results
37.       Section 5.04 of the Loan Agreement required that EGAT shaLl produce
from internal sources, funds equivalent to not less than 15% for fiscal years
1978 and 1979 and not Less than 20% for fiscaL year 1980 and thereafter of its
average capital expenditures for electricity operations for three years
comprising the test year, the next preceding year and the next following
year. Also, Section 3.04 of the Guarantee Agreement required that the Govern-
ment shall take all actions necessary to enable EGAT to: (a) set its tariffs
at levels sufficient to provide revenues required under Section 5.04 of the
Loan Agreement, and (b) to make adjustments of its electricity tariffs for
fuel price fluctuations. In FY78, EGAT produced funds from internal sources
equivalent to 11.5% of its average capital investment for electricity opera-
tions, compared to the 15% covenanted. Under Loan 1527-TH (March 9, 1978) for
the Accelerated Rural Electrification Project it was agreed to change to a
rate of return covenant,-for ECAT and the power sector, of 7% for FY79 and 9%
for FY80 and thereafter, on net revalued fixed assets. This change of finan-
cial covenant was necessary because it was difficult to arrive at a consistent
figure of self-financing ratio applicable to EGAT and the sector as a whole.
Unfortunately, 1979 was a very dry year and EGAT had to rely substantially on
thermal-generation at a time when fuel prices increased by 115Z. The Govern-
ment tried to assist EGAT and created an Oil Fund to subsidize EGAT by
charging higher prices to gasoline consumers. The Government also tried to
raise tariffs in November 1979 by as much as 71% for EGAT and 56% at sector



- 14 -
level, but this increase was not politically feasible. As a result, EGAT's
actual rate of return for FY79 was only 2.72 on net revalued fixed assets.
Despite these difficulties the Government managed to raise tariffs in February
1980 by 50% for EGAT and 38% for the power sector. Realizing that additional
efforts were needed to fully restore EGAT's financial viability, a Plan of
Action was agreed at the time of negotiating Loan 1852-TH (Mae Moh Lignite
Project). Under that plan, the tariffs were to be gradually adjusted to
eliminate all oil subsidies by January 1, 1981 and EGAT was to achieve a rate
of return of not less than 2% in FY81 and 8% in FY82 and thereafter. EGAT and
the Government have so far fuLly complied with this plan; oiL subsidies were
eliminated, and electricity tariffs were increased in two steps (October 1980
and January 1981) by 432 at EGAT's leveL or 352 at sector level and further
increased in April 1981 by 20% at ECAT's level or 19% at sector level.
Consequently, in FY81 EGAT earned a rate of return of 9.2% compared to the 2%
covenanted for that year.
38.       While ECAT's tariffs remained unchanged in FY82, a small reduction
(4%) was implemented in April 1983 in Line with the reduction in EGAT's
operating costs as a result of decreases in oil prices. Prior to September
30, 1982, EGAT had been exempted by a ResoLution of the Cabinet from remitting
net income to the Ministry of Finance and although EGAT had requested an
extension of this exemption until end-1991, by letter dated February 4, 1983
the Ministry of Finance required EGAT to remit B 190 million (5%) of its
historical net income for FY82. The level of remittances to be made by EGAT
in future are to be determined by the Ministry of Finance on a year-to-year
basis. For FY83 ECAT made a remittance of B 250 million (5.3Z) of its his-
torical net income for that year. Despite these remittances to the Ministry
of Finance and the small tariff reduction in April 1983, EGAT earned in FY82
and FY83, rates of return in excess of the 8Z covenanted.
39.       The foLlowing outlines other financial covenants in the Loan
Agreement and their compliance:
(a)   EGAT would review before April 30 in each of its fiscal years the
adequacy of its tariffs to meet the requirement set forth in the
revenue covenant. This covenant was modified under Loan 2000-TH
(Power Subseccor Project) where EGAT is required to review quarterly
the adequacy of its tariffs. EGAT has monitored its tariffs on an
almost continuous basis;
(b)   EGAT would maintain in its tariff schedules a provision for changes
in fuel costs. This provision has been reflected since August 1,
1977 in EGAT's, PEA's and MEA's tariff schedules but its imple-
mentation has sometimes suffered delays as described in para. 37;
(c)   EGAT's long-term debt should not exceed 1.5 times its equity, and
its short or medium-term debt should not exceed 15Z of its total
debt. EGAT has complied every year with both these covenants;
(d)   EGAT would:  (i) submit to the Bank by April 1 of each year its
audited financial statements and a report of such audit; and
(ii) continue to employ qualified and experienced financial



- 15 -
consultants. The financial reporting requirements have been met and
EGAT continues to employ Coopers and Lybrand as financial
consultants; and
(e)   EGAT would revalue its fixed assets annually on the basis of the
fixed capital formation deflator used for the Government's annual
accounts. A pro forma revaluation of EGAT's fixed assets is carried
out annually, beginning with FY71 assets and using the fixed capital
formation deflator.
VI. PRO7ECT ACHIEVEMENTS AND ECONOMIC RE-EVALUATION
Project Achievements
40.       The hydroelectric component of the project was executed as
planned. Reservoir filling started in June 1980 and by the commissioning of
the first generating unit in July 1981, the reservoir water level was at
109.5 m (MSL) with a storage of about 1,140 MCM, which matched with the upper
rule curve. The plant has been functioning satisfactorily and up to the end
of December 1983, water released from the reservoir and power generation were
3,053 MCM and 457 GWh. The average volume of water required per kWh of pover
generation was about 6.68 cu m.

tion of B687 million to finance the costs of the dam allocatable to irrigation
is excluded from the total project cost. These internal rates of return are
substantially the same as shown in the appraisal report.
Least-cost Solution
46.       The Pattani Hydroelectric Plant is the least-cost solution in com-
parison to other sources of power for the Southern Region up to and slightly
above the 12% discount rate used in the appraisaL.

VII. BANK PERFORMANCE
Project Identification and Preparation
47.       The Bank played an active role in supporting an appropriate analysis
of the project. The original design concept was the Pattani River Project, a
multipurpose river basin development. The Bank recognized early in 1976 that
the project did not appear to have a high priority as a power project alone.
The Bank, therefore, encouraged a re-evaluation of the irrigation benefits and
a review of the overall project costs. As a result, sufficient evidence
became available to support the power project viability and an appraisal
mission visited Thailand in October 1976. By end 1976 the Bank's participa-
tion in the project had helped ensure cofinancing by the Kuwait Fund for Arab
Economic Development.
Loan Processing
48.       The Appraisal Report for the Pattani Hydroelectric project (Report
1447-TH) was produced on July 25, 1977 and the report and recomendations of
the President to the Executive Directors on August 15, 1977. The loan was
guaranteed by the Kingdom of Thailand. The Loan and Guarantee agreements were
signed on September 23, 1977. The loan became effective on December 20, 1977,
after the tariff increases that had been approved by the Guarantor had been
implemented.
Supervision
49.       The Bank carried out seven supervision missions from October 1977 to
March 1981. Most of the supervision missions were carried out in conjunction
with supervision of other projects, or with sector or appraisal missions.
Working Relationship
50.       The working relationship of the Bank with both the Government and
EGAT continued to be very good during project preparation, loan processing,
and project implementation. Recommendations made by Bank missions were mostly
accepted or given due consideration.

VIII. CONCLUSIONS
51.       The construction of the Pattani Hydroelectric plant was executed by
EGAT essentially as planned, and with due regard to ecological and environ-
mental factors. The resettlement plan was carried out successfully.
52.       Project preparation and procurement for the major items, in
particular the civil works, were well advanced by the date of loan approval.
The Pattani Hydroelectric Plant was completed about two months ahead of
schedule, and at a cost slightly below the appraisaL estimate.  This tends to
confirm the importance of advanced project preparation, including early
procurement actions, prior to loan approval, for the successfuL implementation
of a project involving large civil works.
53.       The transmission system expansion included in the project was
specifically designed to support the Rural Electrification Program of PEA.
However no dates were established in the Anpraisal Report for the implementa-
tion of these transmission items. Some of the transmission items were not
commissioned in time to supply several of the distribution networks completed
under PEA's first Accelerated Rural Electrification Project (Loan 1527-TH),
which was appraised in parallel with the Pattani Hydroelectric Project. It
would appear desirable that when two Bank financed projects are to be executed
by independent agencies and these projects include interdependent components,
the Bank should require that the executing agencies enter into an appropriate
agreement to coordinate the implementation of the interdependent components.
54.       Several substantial tariff increases were implemented by government
during 1980-81. This helped restore the financial viability of both EGAT and
the sector as a whole, and enabled EGAT to remit to the Ministry of Finance
about 5Z of its historical net income for FY82 and FY83. However, the finan-
cial condition of both EGAT and the sector should be kept under review as the
impact of the above-mentioned cariff increases declines.

Evaluation of Benefits
(a) Benefits in the period 1981 to 1987, consist of:
(i)   Pattani generation which substitutes thermal generation and has
been evaluated using the fuel costs (in 1981 prices) of 15 MW gas
turbines in the Southern Region as follows:
1981          1982         1983-87
3.28 B/kWh    4.00 B/kWh    3.81 B/kWh
(ii) Incremental generation attributable to Pattani which has been
evaluated using the long-run marginal cost for the Southern
Region.
(b) Benefits in the period 1988 to 2026 are entirely attributable to
incremental generation of Pattani and have been evaluated as in (a) (ii)
above.
