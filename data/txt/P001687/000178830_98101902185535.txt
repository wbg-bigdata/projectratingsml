INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF MALI
FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
credit to the Republic of Mali for the equivalent of US$3.6 million on
standard IDA terms to help finance a project for telecommunications. The
proceeds of the credit would be relent to the Office des Postes et
Telecommunications (OPTM) for 20 years including four years of grace with
interest at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOtY
Background
2.        A report on "The Current Economic Situation and Prospects of Mali"
(AW-30a) was distributed to the Executive Directors on December 6, 1971 (R71-
265). A Country Data Sheet is attached in Annex II. The next economic mis-
sion is scheduled for the fall of 1972.
3.        Mali is a large land-locked country, extending from the center
of the Sahara in the north into savannah-type open forest regions along its
southern border. Nearly 40 percent of its area is desert; another 40 per-
cent is usable for extensive livestock production, leaving only 20 percent
suitable for rainfed agriculture and for irrigated agriculture along the
Niger River. With a per capita GDP of about US$55, Mali is one of the
poorest countries in Africa. Its known mineral resources are not economi-
cally exploitable within the short and medium term because of their remote
location. Manufacturing is very limited; it accounts for less than 2 per-
cent of GDP. The main constraints on industrial development are the small
size of the local market, the country's geographic position, which results
in high transport costs and thus limits exports, and the lack of raw mate-
rials. Hence, agriculture, livestock and fisheries remain the basis of
Mali's economy and the principal source of foreign exchange. They account
for 50 percent of employment, and GDP and virtually all exports.
4.        Mali's present economic situation cannot be appreciated without
reference to the economic developments during the 1960's following independ-
ence. Under President Modibo Keita, Mali embarked on an ambitious program
to modernize and develop its economy along socialist lines. A considerable
number of state enterprises were established, mostly in industry, trade and



-2-
transport and the activities of private merchants were limited directly and
indirectly by comprehensive price controls.
5.        These measures had considerable consequences.   Excessive increases
in current expenditures and a large investment program in combination with
sluggish revenue growth resulted in sharply rising budget deficits. Large
Central Bank financing of these deficits in turn gave rise to heavy losses
of foreign exchange reserves.
6.        In 1967, Mali devalued its currency by 50 percent.    However, the
effects of,even-such,7a substantial devaluation-were limited, as the Government
hesitated to take the necessary complementarX measures. Fearing a major- .in-
crease in' te urban cost of living and demands for higher public^service sal-
aries, the Government offset price increase on imported goods by reducing.
import duties and instructing public enterprises to sell a wide range.of
merchandise below cost. As a result, financial losses of public enterprises,
as well as imports, continued to rise. For fear of domestic price increases
of agricultural products the Government did not pass on the higher export
prices to producers. Thus, the devaluation also failed to stimulate pro-
duction and exports, and the balance of payments further deteriorated.
The Recovery Program
7.        The military Government, which-took over in November 1968, declared
Mali's economic recovery to be its main policy objective.    One of its imme-
diate measures was, to raise official prices of the most important crops (mil-
let, rice, groundnuts and cotton) by 10 to 4.0 percent, and to liberalize -
private trade in rural products. The latter resulted in a further increase
of producer prices. These measures were instrumental in sharply increasing
groundnut and cotton production and exports. However, price increases for
millet and rice were insufficient to spur production and to assure an adequate
supply for the domestic market. Hence large imports of food were still
needed.
8.        Nevertheless, the balance of payments improved substantially, with
the overall deficit decreasing from $17.4 million in 1968 to $5.4 million
in 19.71,. i.e. from 6-7 percent of GDP in 1968 and 1969 to about 2 percent
in 1970 and 1971.  Private capital flows increased sharply in line with the
rising confidence in the Malian economy.
9.        The Government, has been less successful in improving public fin-,
ances.  In spite of a successful drive to improve tax collections, as,a re-
sult of which revenues rose some 4 percent annually between 1967/68 and 1971,
public savings remained negative. This was mainly as a result of a 6 percent
annual increase in .current expenditures, which was in turn largely due to
the continued government policy of hiring all school leavers not finding
employment in the private sector. Although some improvement in this respect
wils recorded in 1971 it is unlikely thiat the current budget can be balanced
wI,th.Iu thle next few years,, leaving tlhe Government dependent in diminishing
imounts on a budget subsidy from France.



-3-
.10.       Heavy deficits of most state enterprises, due to inefficient manage-
ment and inadequate pricing policies, were a further drain on public resources.
The Government's recent decision to allow these companies to increase retail
prices of several basic consumption goods is thus an important step. But more
needs to be done in the way of price liberalization and improvement of manage-
ment before the public enterprises can achieve satisfactory results.
11.       Little progress has been made in rescheduling Mali's high foreign
debt, two thirds of which is held by the U.S.S.R. and the People's Republic
of China. Service payments amount to some 20 percent of government revenues
and 13 percent of export earnings, but are projected to reach 50 percent of
both budgetary revenues and exports by 1976, unless substantial rescheduling
can be arranged. However, while there have been no formal agreements on this
subject, Mali is already receiving, and is likely to continue to receive,
a de facto moratorium for the bulk of its foreign debt, since the U.S.S.R.
and China seem willing not to insist on timely servicing of their credits
in a situation of serious financial difficulty.    In consequence, the real
debt burden is likely to be much lower than the above projections suggest,
which would considerably ease the balance of payments and budget problems.
Longer-Term Objectives
12.       Mali's prospects for accelerating economic recovery are primarily
dependent on agricultural production, both for exports and, increasingly, for
substituting imports. The Bank Group and other external lenders are providing
substantial assistance to Mali to carry out projects for rice and millet
which will be crucial for the achievement of these objectives. However, the
Government will also have to provide adequate incentives to farmers by in-
creasing producer prices for these crops. The Government's continuing
hesitation to increase producer prices, and thus to avoid cost of living
increases, higher civil service salaries and higher public expenditures is
only partly justified, since a large part of total urban demand for food is
already covered by the black market at prices substantially higher than of-
ficial prices.
13.       In the longer run, the country should benefit from its highly
competitive cost structure vis-a-vis neighboring countries. After the
devaluation of 1967, Mali's production costs have become particularly
favorable for products such as rice, millet and livestock. For the same
reason, there is some scope for increased exports of manufactures, mainly
textiles.
Foreign Aid
14.       During 1966/67-1970, Mali received, on the average, US$30 million
of external aid per annum including technical assistance of about US$3 million.
Nearly half of this aid was provided by the U.S.S.R. and the People's Republic
of China in the form of long-term loans on concessionary terms. Close to 40
percent came from France and the European Communities in the form of grants.
IDA's contribution was less than 3 percent.

7T   Mostly from U.A.R.
16.       Foreign aid financed about 90 percent of public investment.    Chinese
assistance concentrated on manufacturing industries (sugar, textiles), while
Russian development aid was mainly for geological research and the construction
of a large sports stadium in Bamako. About half of the French development
grants were for agricultural projects, while the European Development Fund/
(FED) mainly concentrated on infrastructure and schools.
17.       The revised 1970-72 Rehabilitation Program envisages public invest-
ments of US$170 million to be financed up to 87 percent (US$150 million) by
foreign aid, which would imply an increase in foreign aid of almost 60 per-
cent over the previous four-year period. However, it is more likely that
only about 60 percent of the Program will be implemented. FED, FAC, IDA -and
bilateral aid from Eastern countries have already committed some $100 million.
Total disbursements during the period are estimated at $72 million, of which
IDA would contribute some $12.6 million or 18 percent.
18.       Given its limited capacity to raise public savings, its difficult
foreign exchange situation and heavy debt service burden Mali will continue
to rely heavily on foreign assistance. This assistance should, to the maximum
extent possible, be on concessionary terms and cover a high proportion of
total project costs, including substantial local expenditures.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALI
19.       The proposed credit would be IDA's fourth operation in Mali
bringing the total.to $27.3 miillion (net of cancellations).  Bank Group
lending during the 1960's was limited to one operation, the $9.1 million
first railway credit in 1966, mainly as a result of poor economic performance



- 5 -
and the absence of economically justified projects. However, project prepara-
tion has been stepped up sharply. The Bank's 1969 economic mission, whose re-
commendations were taken into account in the Government's Three Year Rehabili-
tation Program, provided the basis for formulating a substantially expanded
Bank group lending program. The first results of these efforts have already
materialized.   A highway rehabilitation and maintenance credit was approved
in FY 1971, followed by a credit for the Mopti Rice Project and the proposed
telecommunications credit. The total amount disbursed as of April 30, 1972
was $12.2 million; the amount undisbursed was $11.5 million. While progress
under the first railway credit has been slow, the problem has now been resolved
and the project will be completed by the end of 1972. Progress under the
other two credits is satisfactory. Annex I contains a summary statement of
IDA credits as of April 30, 1972, and provides further information on the
execution of ongoing projects.
20.       Bank Group lending to Mali aims essentially at three objectives,
all of which are closely linked to the goals of Mali's Three Year Rehabili-
tation Plan and longer term development goals. They are: (a) increasing
production, mainly in the rural sector; (b) improving social and economic
infrastructure; and (c) institution building.
21..      One ongoing project, the Mopti Rice project, and several other
projects now in preparation, focus on the first objective. Half of the
lending contemplated for the next five years (1973-77) will be channeled
to rural production. Lending in areas such as livestock (where a project
is due to be ready for consideration in FY 1973), cotton (FY 1974) and
groundnuts (FY 1974) will be greatly facilitated by the experience already
gained and research carried out in Mali and elsewhere in West Africa. How-
ever, in other areas, particularly for integrated rural development projects
(Haute Vallee Project, FY 1974), much groundwork and experimentation are still
necessary before satisfactory projects can be prepared. But Mali provides
an important instance of the need to establish new and more broadly based
schemes to develop the rural sector, the benefits of which would be dis-
tributed to a large number of farmers.
22.       The second objective of improving infrastructure as a comple-
ment to directly productive investments is illustrated by the recent trans-
port projects and by the proposed telecommunications project. _The Bank
Group's first credit to Mali in 1966 was for railway rehabilitation (95-MLI)
and the road maintenance credit of 1970 (197-MLI) will help to reestablish
a functional feeder roads system. A second highway project is being appraised
and a second railway project (FY 1973) will be appraised shortly. The second
highway project and the proposed telecommunications project will serve to
improve internal communications and transport arteries, while the proposed
second railway credit would mainly facilitate international trade. Another
area of high priority is education, where it is hoped that Bank Group assist-
ance somewhat later would help reorganize the educational system to make it
more responsive to manpower requirements and also reduce its impact on the
budget over the longer term. An education component will also be an important



- 6 -
element in, the integrated rural development projects, mainly in the form of
continuing and expanding Mali's recent encouraging experience with non-formal
functional literacy programs.
23.       Thirdly, an essential feature of Bank Group operations is the
technical, managerial and financial strengthening of institutions. Thus an
important purpose of the first railway credit was to make the Regie into a
viable institution, an objective which has not yet been fully achieved. Sim-
ilarly, the highway maintenance credit helps to establish a more efficient
maintenance organization. Institution building is a major reason for involve-
ment in the proposed telecommunications credit.
24.       Lack of public savings and insufficient capacity to prepare and
carry out projects will remain the main bottlenecks to increasing the amount
of lending to Mali. The latter problem can be eased by increasing technical
assistance. However, on the first problem, it would be unrealistic to expect
public savings to increase rapidly enough to contribute significantly to
investment. Thus, for some time to come, it will be necessary for external
aid to finance a high proportion of total project cost, including for certain
projects some (project related) recurrent expenditures.
PART III - THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR
25.       Telecommunications services are so inadequate and costly that they
are one of the main bottlenecks to a more efficient organization of produc-
tion, trade and public administration. Mali's telephone density is extremely
low (1 per 1,000 inhabitants). Furthermore, the distribution of existing
capacity is heavily concentrated in Bamako, the capital, leaving the rest of
this vast country virtually uncovered. Although in December 1971, Mali had
5,400 telephones, only a small number were in the savannah regions which
contain a large part of the population and most of the economic potential.
The quality of the service is poor because OPTM lacks experienced technical
staff and its financial resources do not permit the domestic telecommunica-
tions system to be adequately maintained.   Lack of foreign exchange has par-
ticularly hampered the purchase of spare parts. Consequently, fault rates
are high and long distance circuits congested.
26.       Although the tariffs are roughly in line with those in other former
French West African territories, they are very high compared with similar
services inmother developing countries. Local calls in-Mali cost US 144
as compared to US 2-5i in most other developing countries.
27.       Past increases in the supply of telephones were far below demand.
In recent years, the number of telephones increased by only 3 percent per
annum while the demand based on the waiting list, was growing by 8 percent
per annum in-Bamako and 6 percent in the main provincial towns.



-7-
28.       To eliminate this serious bottleneck, the Government has decided
to more than double its telecommunication investment from around MF 1.1 bil-
lion ($1.9 million) in the current 1970-72 investment program to some
MF 2.2 billions ($4.3 million) in the 1973-76 Plan. This program constitutes
the proposed project. It would provide sufficient capacity to cover the
existing backlog and projected demand through 1976.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       A report entitled "Appraisal of a Telecommunications Project of
the Office des Postes et Telecommunications du Mali (OPTM), Mali"
(No. PU-89a, dated May 17, 1972) is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. A Credit and Project Summary is provided in Annex III.
The Project
30.       The project comprises OPTM's 1972-1975 telecommunications program,
which aims at rehabilitating and expanding the principal local and long
distance facilities in order to improve the physical condition of the network,
eliminate congestion, improve the quality of service, and meet present and
expected demand through 1977. The project is based primarily on a study
carried out in 1965 by the Bureau d'Etudes des Postes et Telecommunications
d'Outre Mer (BEPTOM), a consulting and advisory organization sponsored by
the French Government.   Because of inadequate funds, OPTM has been able to
implement only a portion of the consultants' recommendations, namely, an addi-
tion of 1,000 lines to the Bamako automatic exchange. The study was reviewed
and updated by OPTM in 1970 in consultation with IDA. The proposed project
has been selected from the remaining portion of the recommended expansion.
Negotiations took place in Washington from May 3-8, 1972. The Malian Delega-
tion was headed by His Excellency, Mr. Tieoule Konate, President Director
General of the Malian Development Bank.
31.       The project comprises the following main items:
(a) the rehabilitation of existing switching equipment, the addi-
tion of 1,000 lines of switching equipment to the Bamako
automatic telephone exchange, and the replacement of manual
equipment in five provincial towns by 1,300 lines of automatic
switching equipment (14 percent of total project cost);
(b) the expansion of cable distribution and subscriber facilities
to provide for approximately 2,500 additional direct exchange
connections and the rehabilitation of existing cable distribu-
tion and subscriber facilities (10 percent of total project
cost);
(c) the construction of a microwave link between Bamako, Segou,
San and Mopti, with multiplexing equipment and trunk switching



equipment for 60 channels, expandable to 960 (54 percent of
total project cost);
(d) the' rehabilitation of open-wire routes and the expansion by'
VHF of spur rout&s originating from towns along the microwave--
link (14 percent of total project cost);
(e) the employment of consultants for the detailed engineering,
procurement, supervision of project execution and reorganiza-
tion of OPTM's accounting (5 percent of.total project cost);
and
(f) the employment of a management expert tc assist the Director
of Telecommunications (3 percent of total project cost).
Cost and Financing
32.       Total project costs, net of taxes, are estimated at $4.3 million
with a foreign exchange component of $3.1 million. The proposed IDA credit
of $3.6 would finance 84 percent of total costs, covering the foreign exchange
component, and 45 percent' of local expenditures. The balance, $0.7 million
equivalent, would be financed by OPTM. Such cost' sharing is in line with
Mali's limited domestic resources and the need for external lenders to fin-
ance a substantial part of total costs. The proceeds of the credit would
be relent by the Government to OPTM at 7-1/4 percent annual interest to be
repaid in 20 years, including a grace period of four years. The Government
would bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project Entity
33.       The OPTM was established in 1960 as a government-owned entity.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors is the Minister of Transport, Tele-
communications and Tourism. OPTM's organization is divided into four
departments--Telecommunications, Administration, Accounting and Postal/
Financial. This last Department operates the postal system and a country-
wide public checking account service. The statutes that created OPTM give
it an industrial and commercial character and endow it with legal person-
ality and financial autonomy. However, in practice OPTM has not been able
to enjoy the degree of financial autonomy accorded it by its statutes.
Project Execution
34.       Present telecommunication facilities in Mali are in poor condition
because of insufficient maintenance and plant replacement, and OPVT is lack-
ing staff with technical and managerial experience to carry out the urgently
needed rehabilitation and expansion. Therefore, although overall responsi-
bility for the project execution rests with the OPTMI, construction of the main
works would be carried out by the equipment suppliers under the consultants'
supervision. OPTi's staff would be associated with this work in order to



-9-
obtain training. Contractual arrangements with the suppliers would also
provide for training of OPTM's staff in the maintenance of the equipment
installed under the credit. To strengthen the managerial and the technical
capacity of OPTM in the execution of the project, assistance will be provided
to advise and train Malian counterparts, particularly in the preparation of
bidding documents and contracts, bid evaluation, supervision of project works,
accounting, auditing, and in day-to-day operations in switching, transmission
and local networks.
Financial Arrangements
35.       The present financial difficulties of OPTMI's Telecommunications
Department have several causes. Before 1968, both the Postal/Financial
and the Telecommunications Departments operated at a loss. Since 1968,
however, telecommunications operations have been profitable, producing a
surplus more than sufficient to cover the annual losses from postal/financial
operations. Although OPTM's statute requires the Government to meet any
overall annual deficit which it may incur, it nevertheless did not do so,
when OPTM was regularly incurring annual overall deficits before. Further-
more, the Government has not settled its bills for telecommunications and
other charges. OPTM has been able to continue its operations only by being
permitted to overdraw on its current Treasury account and by utilizing private
funds deposited in OPTM's public checking accounts. The arrangements, des-
cribed in paragraphs 36-39 below, which have been made to put OPTM on a sound
financial basis, are thus an essential part of the proposed project.
36.       The settlement of outstanding debts between the Government and
OPTM's Telecommunications Department will be achieved by offsetting the
deficits of the Telecommunications Department prior to 1968 and the unpaid
charges for telecommunication services rendered to the Government through
December 1971 against the balances due to the Government by OPTM in respect
of telecommunications at the end of 1971. The Government has also guaranteed
adequate working capital for the Telecommunications Department's future
operations. Furthermore, the Government will prepare a plan to settle the
deficits of the Postal/Financial Department of the OPTM prior to 1968 and
restore the financial position of the Department to good order. The Gov-
ernment will also cover any future deficit arising from postal/financial
operations.
37.        In order to ensure that OPTM will not find itself without the funds
to meet its commitments as it occasionally has in the past, OPTM will transfer
the funds necessary to carry out the project quarterly and in advance from
OPTM's account with the Treasury to an independent bank account in OPTM's
name.
38.       For the continued viability of the project, assurances have been
obtained that domestic telecommunication tariffs will be reviewed when the
accounts for telecommunications and postal/financial services are effectively
separated, and the assets inventoried and valued in order to achieve a rate



- 10 -
of return on OPTM's telecommunication net fixed assets in operations of not
less than 10 percent beginning in 1977.
39.       Assurances have also been obtained that, without prior approval by
the Association, OPTM will not incur long-term or short-term debts for tele-
communications operations above the limits defined in the Section 4.08 and
4.09 of the Project Agreement, neither will it undertake any capital expendi-
tures for telecommunications, other than under the Project, in excess of
$75,000 equivalent in any year unless the Association shall have approved a
financing plan therefor.
Procurement
40.       All goods and services (except consultants) financed by IDA would
be procured through international competitive bidding, except for small
quantities of tools and miscellaneous services. IDA financing for these
exceptions would-amount to about US$75,000. The Government will relieve
OPTM of customs duties and import taxes on all imported equipment for the
project, and bid evaluation will be made net of such charges..
Benefits
41.       A conservative estimate of the economic return on the project,
using present tariffs and December 1971 prices, is 13 percent. Present
forecasts indicate that, after 1973, OPTM would have surplus funds from
telecommunications operations sufficient, after meeting the requirements
of the project, to permit a transfer of funds to the Government. It is
estimated that the total amount available for transfer over the project
period would be MF 240 million, equivalent to 50 percent of net telecom-
munications profits or a dividend of 3 percent per annum on the Telecom-
munications Department national equity.
42.       In giving emphasis to regions with promising potential for
future economic growth outside the capital, the project will also provide
non-quantifiable economic benefits by promoting the commercialization of
rural products (mostly rice and fish), expanding exports and encouraging
trade with Bamako, the main distribution center for imported goods.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
43.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Mali and the Association, the draft Project Agreement between the Association
and the Office des Postes at Telecommunications (OPTN), the Recommendation
of rthe Conutmlttee provided for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles
of AAreetiieait of the Association and the text of a resolution approving the
proposed credit are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
Conditions for effectiveness of the Agreements would be (i) the employment



of engineering consultants, (ii) the making of satisfactory arrangements
for the extension of financial assistance for OPTM's present financial
adviser and (iii) the making of a satisfactory financial settlement for the
Telecommunications Department of the OPTM.
44.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
45.       I recommend that the Executive Director approve the proposed
credit.

B.   Projects in Execution
The US$9.1 million Railway project of 1966 (95-MLI) is now com-
pleted as originally planned. However, the Association has agreed that
savings of $480,000 under the credit be used for track renewal on an addi-
tional 14 km. The closing date, originally June 30, 1970, was first postponed
to December 31, 1971 and, in view of the additional track renewal, has now
been postponed to December 31, 1972. Performance under the Credit has not
been fully satisfactory. In particular, the Railway's financial situation
has remained precarious. Most of the forwarding business on the Railway is
handled by two private agencies which often are not paid regularly by their
clients (predominantly public enterprises) and which therefore delay payments
to the Railway. Furthermore, the Government has not reimbursed the Railway
for past deficits and has not provided funds to ensure repayment of debts to
the Senegal Railway as originally agreed. However, action is now being taken
to settle debts and improve the financial situation. The US$7.7 million High-
way Maintenance project of 1970 (197-MLI) is being implemented in cooperation
with the International Labor Organization (ILO). The Borrower's performance
is good and the project is progressing on schedule. The US$6.9 million Rice
Development credit of January 1972 (277-MLI) is expected to become effective
shortly. It is the first in a series of scheduled Bank Group operations in
Mali's agricultural sector.
