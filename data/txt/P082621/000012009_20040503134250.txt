A.       STRATEGICCONTEXTAND RATIONALE

1.       Countryand sector issues

The Government o f Pakistan (GOP) sets out inits Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (December, 2003) a
four-pronged approach to alleviatingpoverty: (i)     achieving highand broad-based economic growth
focusing particularly on the rural economy, while maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii)   improving
governance andconsolidating devolution, bothas a means o f deliveringbetter development results and
ensuring social and economicjustice; (iii)    investinginhuman capitalwith a renewedemphasis on
effective delivery o fbasic social services; and (iv) bringingthe poor and vulnerable and backwardregions
into the mainstream of development, and to make markedprogress inreducing existinginequalities.

Insupport ofobjective(ii), enactedonAugust 14,2001 newarrangementsfor transferring
                               GOP
responsibility to district, tehsil and union (wards of about 25,000 people) council governments. Direct
elections for union councils have beenheldand the union councils have indirectly elected tehsil and
district councils representatives. There are reserved seats for women, minorities and peasantsand
workers at all levels. Government administrationi s also being decentralized by transferringcivil servants
andadministrative authority to local levels. Twenty-five percent (25%) ofthe development budget is to
be transfetred to localgovernments for development of projects with the participation of local
communitiesthrough the Citizen Community Boards (CCBs). The underlyingrationale for this
transformationis to create a government structure that responds more effectively to local needs.

More recently, the GOP has committed itself to aparticipation-based, community development of
infrastructure and services initiatedunder the Community InfrastructureProject (CIP) inthe Northwest
Frontier Province (NWFP), which was financed under an IDA Credit (2928-PK) that closed on June 30,
2003. h a dJammu and Kashmir (AJK)is now implementing a similar program under IDA Credit (3689-
PK). NWFP will continue CIP under the Credit now proposed. The Government's aim was to adopt the
experience of CIP inlinkingthese local community participation programs to the administration of
development funds allocated to local governments under the overall government decentralization
program.

The mostpervasive constraint confrontingthese efforts is the needto builduprapidly the human and
institutional capacity at all levels of local government. Inresponseto the Governmentplans to
decentralize, Credit 2928 was amended in2002 to allocate $2.9 millionto support the plan of the
National Reconstruction Bureauto train some 200,000 newly-elected officials inthe rudiments of
effective government processes and local development. A substantial part o f this programhas been
carriedout effectively. A sizeable proportion of the proposed credit will be devoted to the development
of the capacity of two major groups to manage community development and service delivery: (i)     elected
and non-elected government officials at the district, tehsil and union council levels; and, (ii)
                                                                                               memberso f
local community based organizations (CBOs), which when registered under the Local Government
Ordinance, become Citizen Community Boards (CCBs).

A secondmajor issuerelates to the inter-relationshipofthe CIP to the newinstitutions beingcreatedby
decentralization and the needto adapt CIP procedures appropriately. Basedon the 8 pilot activities with 6
municipal tehsils (TMAs) under Credit 2928, the World Bank and the Government o fNWFPhave agreed
on a revised set o f implementation procedures and a well thought out capacity buildingprogram for the
TMAs, UnionAdministration (UA), and CCBs now incorporatedinthe OperationalManual for the
proposed CIP-11.

Finally, there are ongoing service delivery issues that will continue to be addressed during
implementation o fthe proposed project. These include the need to further strengthen community

development efforts prior to the financing of infrastructure; deepen social outreach activities to support
the empowerment o f women; createbetter linksbetween on-site and off-site infrastructure; expand the
health and sanitationcomponent; and continue thus far, largely successful efforts to ensure that O&M
activities are financed and carried out by the communities. The Government o fNWFP i s well aware of
these challenges and i s taking the appropriate steps to strengthenthe capacity of local communitiesin
these areas through its out reach activities.

2.       Rationale for Bankinvolvement

The World Bank is uniquelyplacedto support this major transformationbecauseof its longhistory of
working with GOP and the provincial government on poverty and decentralization issues and its clear
leadership insupporting policy initiatives andinstitutional reforms inthese areas. This i s particularly true
inNWFPwhere the Bankhasplayedakeyrole inthe development ofthe CIPprogramandits transition
to Government's decentralization. The Bank's continuing and close involvement inits institutional
development through project preparation and lendingis still crucial for the further development o fthe
program, particularly as it adjusts to devolution, not only inNWFP, but also inthe rest of Pakistan.

Other donors have also been undertaking infrastructure programs. ADB i s focusing on mediumand large
infrastructureprojects inurban areas and is assisting a rural water supply and sanitation project inPunjab.
The U K ' s Department for InternationalDevelopment (DfID) and Swiss Agency for Development and
Cooperation (SDC) are assisting capacity buildingmainly at the district level, with DfID financing some
small scale rural water supply and sanitation physical investments and capacity buildinginNWFP. These
donors are providing technical assistance and investmentsinbasic service delivery, but the leadership in
developing and expandingthe CIP concept has clearly rested with the Bank.

3.       Higher level objectives to which the project contributes

The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) i s closely aligned with the Government's poverty
reduction strategy described above and gives highpriority to: (i)implementing programs that deliver
infrastructure and services to low income groups: and (ii)   improving the efficiency and responsivenessof
Govemment, insubstantial part throughthe devolution o f power to local levels of government. The
proposed project is specifically.designedto foster these objectives.

3.       Project development objective and key indicators

The proposed CIP-I1buildson the successhl experiences o f the first CIP and other complementary
programs inthe NWFP, but adapts it to devolution. The project will be open to all participating tehsil
municipal administration(TMA) units that have demonstrated their capacity to manage the program and
within these to all communities, taking into account the readiness o fresidents to participate, the level o f
poverty and current access to basic infrastructure. Themain objective of theproject is topromote the


                                                       2

well being of low income communities of NWFP by: (a) supporting investments in community
development activities, basic services and small scaleproductive infrastructure; and (b) strengthening
capacity at the new devolved local government and community levels, toplan and deliver such services
and infrastructure.

The CIP-I1will integrate the new, more decentralized and participativeprocedures from the
Government's devolution policies. The immediate outcomes that are expected to result from the project
are: (i)provisiono f improved infiastructure and services to local communities at lower cost with
sustainable O&M mechanism; (ii)     creation and strengthening of CCBs, enabling local residents to
effectively participate indevelopment; (iii) better performance of newly elected local governments in
service delivery and inmobilizing and buildingthe capacity of CCB as measuredby the number of tehsils
qualified to participate inthe program; and (iv) more effective governancethrough improvementsin
operations, monitoring and evaluation, and financial and budgetaryprocedures. The project monitoring
section has developed quantifiable indicators for measuring all of these outcomes as set out inAnnex 3.

Theproposedapproachis to buildthe secondproject on the modelofthe first, butto adapt itas necessary
to absorb the lessonslearned and the changing circumstances inPakistanbrought about by devolution.
Support through investment lendinghas worked well to give the Bank sufficient involvement not only to
have an important impact on project implementation, but also to replicate the CIP concept throughout
Pakistan.

4.       Project Components

The CP-I1will be a demand led local infrastructure and services program. Its key feature i s the
partnership between the local government and the communities and it i s this partnership that confers its
strength and success. The project is designed to meet the most pressingsector need, which i s to develop
institutionalandhuman capacity ina decentralized environment to encouragecommunity development
and help reduce poverty. (Annex 4 provides a full description of the components and Annex-5 provides
detail cost breakdown). The estimated total project cost i s US$53.3 million. The project's three main
components are:

1. LocalInfrastructure & Services (US$42.75million): This component would involve support to
participatingCCBs andTMAs sub-project investments insmall scale and productive infrastructure
projects.

2. ImprovingLocal Level Performance (US$4.23million): This component would have two distinct
sub-components:

         Institutional Strengtheningsub-component: This would provide implementation support,
         training and equipment to local government institutions, particularly at the tehsil level, to enable
         themto administer effectively their local service programs, fiscal andbudgetary management and
         plans.

         CommunityDevelopmentActivitiessub-component: This would provide implementation
         support, training and equipment to support the activities of CCBs and communities to buildthe
         capacity of localresidents to support their own development through awareness o f and
         participation incommunity development approaches, infrastructure development, health and
         hygiene, and special support to women and children and the vulnerable groups intheir
         community.




                                                      3

3. ImplementationSupport,MonitoringandEvaluation(US5.43 million): This component would
have (i) technical assistancemostly local and regional, for capacity buildingand training; to improve local
capacity, particularly at the tehsil level; and (ii)
                                                   implementation support to the LG&RDD to improve
overall administration andcoordinationincludingsupervision, monitoring and impact evaluation. This
will finance the program's incremental costso fadministration, operation and coordination including
supervision, and a different approach to handlingmonitoring and impact evaluation.

These inter-locking components are all essentialelements of an integrated, decentralized, participation-
basedsystem for providing infrastructure and services to low-income people inlocal communities. "Local
Infrastructure Services" is the actual implementationand financing o f these local infrastructure schemes.
The inputsare technical assistance, training and finance provided through the tehsils and communities
and the outcomes are more development oriented tehsils and communities actively participatingin
developing valuable infrastructureprojects and basic social services. "Improving Local Level
Performance" has two dimensions and is essentialto the decentralization effort and, particularly, the
effort to transfer mucho f the responsibility for operating the CIP program to the tehsil level and the
communities through specific capacity development programs. The inputsare provision of technical
assistance, training andequipment to local governments, particularly tehsils, and the outcome is the
development o f a growing number of tehsils able to assist CCBs effectively.

"Community Development i s the essentialeffort that the tehsils will make to buildthe capacity of local
                            "
communities (CCBs) on how to participate inplanning and implementingtheir own development
programs. The inputsare technical assistance, training and selectedCD programs and the outcome i s the
increasednumber of communities able to plan and implementprograms and projects. "Implementation
Support i s largely directedat improvingthe capacity of the overall system and, particularly, the capacity
         "
o f LGE&RDD to manage the overall program effectively and, inparticular, to provide implementation
assistance and training to the'tehsils and councils and other levels o f local govemments. The inputs are
technical assistanceand training and some minor elements of equipment and the outcome i s the creation
of a systemwhich i s better managedwith improved incentives, assistanceto local govemments enabling
themto take over major responsibility for implementing CIP andbetter monitoring and execution
o fthe overall program.

5.      Lessonslearnedandreflectedinthe projectdesign

Lessons learned from the first operation, other similar programs inPakistan and internationalbest practice
have been builtinto the proposedproject as follows:

        Development of adequate human and institutional capacity i s essential at all levels and this was
        initially an issue inthe first project. While this issue has been largely resolved, the new local
        government arrangementsandthe consequentinfusion o f inexperienced elected officials and
        administrative staffcreatesthe need for anew capacity building, which i s built into the design of
        the project;
        The devolutionprogramhas created aneed for revisedimplementation arrangements, which were
        piloted under the first project and will be fully implementedunder this one;
        Rigidand centralized government procedures were initially also amajor challenge; these have
        beenlargely resolvedbut will further berevisedto serve decentralization;
         Sufficient time needs to be allowed for awarenessbuildingand community development before
        planning investments. The project designand implementation schedule take this into account;
        Inthe past, therewas aproblemwithcompetingprograms, which providedhighlysubsidized
        infrastructure services to communities with no requiremento f a local contributionto capital costs
         and O&M. This has beenaddressedto a large extent inthe Local Government Ordinance 2001.
        Attention will also be given to ensuring consistency with other programs including the Kushal
        Pakistan Program, the largest public works program of the Government which adopted the CIP
         approach of community participation inplanning and implementation of infrastructure schemes,
         ifthe government intendsto continue itsoperation; and
         There is a need to strengthen healthand sanitation and support for women component. Priorities
         and staffing have been adjusted to meet this need.

         Alternativesconsideredand reasonsfor rejection

The main option that was considered andrejected was to continue with the model of the first CIP project
without regardto the government's decentralization program. This option was rejected as being
inconsistent with the Government's overall decentralization approach and the needfor decentralized
administration o f community development. Within this framework, two alternative options were
considered: a) pursuingthe pathadopted under CIP Io f assisting a few TMAs and gradually increasing
the numbers o ftehsils able to participate inmanaging the programwhile at the same time financing sub-
projects throughout the province by providing direct support to CCBs from provincial LGE&RDD; or b)
confining programandproject support to those tehsils that develop the capacity to manage their programs
effectively. The decision was to opt forb) becauseoption a) would create a dualistic system that might
later be difficult to integrate and which would impede GOP's objective of decentralizing these programs.
Inorder to avoidthe poorertehsils beingneglected, special attentionwill bedirected to strengthen them
to enable them to prepare and implement sub-projects.

C. IMPLEMENTATION

1.       Partnershiparrangements

The partnership arrangement i s with the lower level local governments and their residents through their
Citizen Community Board, with support and coordination by the province in capacity building,planning,
financing, implementationand operation and maintenance of local infrastructure schemes and community


                                                        5

development programs. The project also envisions partnership with other capacity buildingactivities
already operating inNWFP funded under other Donor assistance.

2.       Institutionalandimplementationarrangements

CIP-I1will continue to deliver specific community development activities and local infrastructure to low-
income groups; however the delivery mechanisms and procedures will be insupport of, and aligned with
the LGOand the capacity o f the TMAs. The project implementationstructure has beendesigned based
on the experience o f CIP-I and improved through continuous consultation with TMAs, LGE&RDD,"3
and CCBs.

The management o fthe project will bebasedon a decentralized, demand drivenstructure that relies
primarily on local CCBs, as the mainaction arm at the community level, and the TMAs, with assistance
from the UAs as the main lower levels of government with the responsibility o fproviding basic
infrastructure services to its citizens. Support for creating and developing CCBs and inpreparingand
implementinglocal infrastructure andsocial programs is beingdecentralized from the Project
Coordination & Support Unit (PCSU) and their RegionalCoordination and Support Teams (RCSTs) in
LGE&RDDto the tehsiyunion levelsconsistent with GOP's decentralization plan.

The project will continue to utilize the existing structure of the LGE&RDD and the core existing staff
from the CIP-I for purposes of the overall coordinationof the project and inpreparing the TMAs to take
responsibility for administeringthe programincommunities and in strengthening and working with CCBs
withintheir boundaries. A ProjectReview Board (PRB), an inter-agency group where all relevant
agencies are represented, will provide overall policy guidance, fiscal oversight, and review and approve
budget for the program activities. (See organogram inAnnex 6)

The institutional arrangementsare as follows:

        TheProject Review Board (PRB),at the apex level o fGoNWFP will be the policy and fiscal
        oversight group for the provincial government. It will approve annual budgets, work plans and
        review policy decisions affecting the overall direction of the program. It will ensure interagency
        coordination. It will be chaired by the Additional Chief Secretary (ACS), and its memberswill
        include the Secretariesof Finance, P&D, LGE&RDD, and Works and Services and Director
        General CIP-II., assistedby a Secretariat attached to the LGE&RDD. Fiscal issues will be
        decided inpartnership with the mandate of the Provincial Finance Commission (PFC)
        (responsible for the allocation, fiscal transfer and contribution to lower levels o f government).
        Program Coordinationand Support Unit (PCSU),ledby a Director General, LGE&RDD, will
        provide overall coordination, prepare the project implementationplan, provide technical and
        professional help to TMAs indeveloping capacity and implementingthe program; establish
        criteria and determine which tehsils have the capacity to participateinthe program; and monitor
        progress preparingconsolidated progress reports and other necessarydocumentation.
        Regional Coordinationand Support Teams (RCSTs) will bethe decentralized arm o fthe PCSU.
        These RCSTs will facilitate and implement the Capacity BuildingProgramand support social
        mobilization and technical aspects on a demand basis.
        EachparticipatingTMAwill set upa CIP Unit(CIPU) under the existing Officeo f Infrastructure
        andServicesofthe TMA, andwill beresponsible for community outreach with the CCBs within
        its boundaries, selecting participants inthe program, working with them indeveloping and
        implementingcommunity actionplansand projects and coordinating with the Tehsil Council, each
        UA, andother participatingagenciesor groups.
        CCBs are voluntary organizations formed at the community level, which mobilize the local
        population, prepare community action plans andimplement infrastructureprojects and social

        programs and have responsibilities for O&M. CCBs will berequiredto register according to
        guidelines issued for this purpose, to be legally recognizedbodies under the Local Government
        Ordinance, as a condition ofparticipation.

CapacityBuilding

The success ofthe project dependson strengtheningthe capacity ofthe major implementationagenciesto
carry out mandated activities. TMAs have beenidentifiedas important stakeholders that require capacity
buildingto enable them, inpartnership with CCBs, to take the project forward. An initialneeds
assessment will be followed by capacity building.At the end of this exercise the TMA's ability to partner
will be assessed.Those not meetingthe criteria inthe first phasewill beprovided additional training and
a chance to partner duringsubsequentphases. An important area will be sensitizing andtraining TMAs to
appreciate the benefits from Community Development, Community Mobilization, and identificationo f
CIP schemes by communities throughtheir CCBs. Training will be given inprocurement, improving
technical skills o f staff, financial management, importance and methods o f social mobilization for
formation o f CCBs, inclusion o f all stakeholders, how to prevent elite capture, gender sensitivity, good
governance andtransparency, information dissemination and awareness, disclosure o f information, M&E
including participatory monitoring.

For CCBs, training similar to those of TMA is envisagedbut deliveredinthe context of grass root
implementation. Training would include areas such as, financial planning, accounting, and procurement,
resource mobilization, cost sharing mechanism, participatory planning and decisionmalung in
implementation o f schemes, gender sensitivity inparticipation, transparency and accountability to
community members, disclosure o f information, good governance, conflict resolution, issues related to
land donation for schemes, Community Action Plan (CAP), M&E including participatory monitoring,
operational manual compliance of social and environmental safeguards of the Bank and the Government.
For women and youth additional training will be provided inleadership, income generatindsavings, non
formal literacy and awarenessofreproductive health.

Selection Criteria

All TMAs are potentialpartners, butwill have to comply with the CP-I1selection criteria. These include
willingnessto work with the CIP-I1approach and methodology, financial strength and cost sharing
affordability and willingness, human resourcesstrength, willingness for women participationinthe
development process and overall institutional capability. TMAs who do not meet with the selection
criteria, will be invitedto a strengthening program that will help the TMA be eligible for the nexdlater
batches of TMAs over the project's implementationtime span of 5 years.

The selection criteria for CCBs to be eligible for CIP I1fundinghas been formulated and agreed. (See
Annex-6 for details). The project will bebudgetedinthe annual Public Sector DevelopmentProgram
(PSDP) of the Government o fNWFP as an identifiable single headbudget itemeachyear showingboth
the local and foreign resources of funding. Initially, the provincial government Finance Department will
make the funds available inadvance from the provincial budget resources to meet at least 25 percent
(25%) of the annual requirement inthe shape of RevolvingFundsto the spending unit at the provincial,
tehsil and registered CCBs levels. This advance will be deposited ina bank account to be operatedjointly
by the designatedofficials andadjustable on completion o fthe respective scheme or completion ofthe
program at the PCSUlevel. The conditions for the releaseo f the revolving funds include: (i) approved
                                                                                                  an
Annual Work Plan from the Tehsil Council; (ii)      copies o f administrative approval o f schemes by the
Secretary, LGE&RDD; and (iii)        evidence that the CCBs have contributed 20 percent share o f capital costs
o f the scheme.

Procurement

The procurement capacity o f the implementing agencies will be strengthenedthrough the engagement o f
consultants and training. LGE&RDDwill engage a localprocurement consultant, to support the
implementingTMAs, at least for the first two years of the project to serve as a focal point for all
procurement matters, including procurement training. EachparticipatingTMA will assign at least one
qualified staff member dedicated exclusively for procurement work under the project.

Goods and works to be financed under the project would be procured inaccordancewith Guidelinesfor
Procurement under IBRD Loans andIDA Credits, January 1995,revised January 1999. Consultant
services would beprocured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelinesfor Selection and Employment of
Consultants by WorldBank Borrowers, January 1997,revised May 2002. Details of the procurement
arrangementsunder the project are specified inAnnex 8. Inthe event of a conflict with the Government's
procedures, IDA'Sprocurement procedures would prevail.

The Bank's standard biddingdocuments for procurement under InternationalCompetitive Bidding(ICB),
and sample biddingdocuments for procurement under National Competitive Bidding(NCB) which are
already beingusedon other Bank financed projects inPakistan, will be used for procurement of Goods
and Works under the project. The model form of community construction agreementthat has been
developed, with the Bank's concurrence, under various Bank Projects (the NDP Project, the Sindh On
FarmWater Management Project and AJK -CIP Project) will be usedfor the works to be carried out
through community participation underthe Project. The Bank's StandardRequest for Proposal document
will be usedfor consultingfirms. The procurement arrangementsunderthe project are intendedto
facilitate maximumcommunity participation inthe procurement process. Small community infrastructure
works will be carried out by the communities, themselves, while larger works will be contracted to private
construction firms by the TMA. The Bank will provide procurement training before and during
implementation o f the project.

3.       Monitoringand Evaluation of outcomes/results

Key to the success o fthe reforms and the project, will be an institutionalized capability to learn from
experience. Evaluation of outcomes will include their assessment by citizens. O f equal importance will
be the creation of an environment for reflective assessment ofperformance, improvement exercises and
experiential leaming amongst involved local governments.

A participatory and flexible systemwill be established, which will buildon the experience of CIP-I, and
focus on transparency through open flows o f information. The systemwill be critical inestablishing
accountability between different institutional tiers. Eachtier will bemonitoringperformance at different
levels (e.g. CCBs will beprovide feedback onbothRCST and TMA performance, while TMAs will be
providing feedback on CCB performance). It i s designed to ensure independence, and triangulation of
information through various sources. The interests o f the various beneficiaries will be aligned to focus on
results basedperformance management, and consensus on what and how to measure will be attained
through facilitated workshops at the start o f the Project. The systemwill also focus on leaming and
innovation, andwill itself be refined iteratively through feedback and learning.

ProcessMonitoring and effective communication will be usedto establish a `learning dynamic', through
which Tehsils, Unions and CCBs can learnnew ways o f operating and best practices from each other.
There will be a particular focus on generating timely learning on gender, participation, equity andpoverty
targetingthrough ProcessMonitoring, beneficiary assessments and special studies. The system will also
highlightcritical feedback loops, andperiodically assesswhether leaming is informing decision-making.
The key elements are:


                                                       8

1) TehsilLevel Performance Management System: for the development of aperformance-oriented
culture (inhumanresource development and tehsil performance). Simple indicators and benchmarks
related to financial performance, human resource managementand service delivery performance (e.g.
coverage, quality, poverty targeting), will be agreedthrough a series o f facilitated workshops. Indicators
will also bereflective o fthe PRSPtargets and the MillenniumDevelopmentGoals. Incentiveswill be
established for community basedmonitoring and social audits, such as annual `citizen report cards' on
service delivery. The M&E/MIS Unitat the PCSUincoordinationwith the RCSTs, will assist the TMAs
indefiningandbuildingthenecessarycapacity for establishingandmaintainingperformance based
systems. This will include a review of the current MIS and IT situation at the Tehsil level (based on the
institutional assessments undertakenby the ISP). EachTMA will develop a realistic and sequenced
TehsilPerformance ImprovementPlanbasedon the analysis.

2) ProjectMonitoring: will focus onproject implementation andperformance, and emphasizethe key
intermediate indicatorsas definedby the Project Design Summary and Key Performance Indicators.
Basic processindicatorshave been definedinthe Operational Manual andhas been agreed during
Negotiations. These will be further discussedwith beneficiaries and refined through workshops at the
start of the Project. A series o f workshops would beundertaken, between the PCSUandRCSTs at first,
and thenwith TMAs and incrementally with participatingUnion Councils and CCBs. Project monitoring
will take place at all tiers: community/CCB, Union Council, TMA, RCST, PCSU, PRB, GoNWFP (e.g.
monitoring committee o f P&DD), and through the Bank's routine monitoring.

A monitoring planwill be established for eachsub-project, and will includeprogress andprocess
indicators (including monitoring of environmental and social safeguards and financial monitoring). The
PCSUwith the respective RCSTs will conduct aneeds analysis to determine capacity building needs, and
define a training programinM&Eand ProcessMonitoring, includingthe establishment of effective
information flows, at all these levels. Annex -11highlightsthe monitoringresponsibilities and
information flows at these various tiers.

4.        Sustainability

The sustainability of the programdepends on a number of factors including continued government
commitment, buildingo f durable institutionalcapacity, the longevity o f infrastructureprojects and a
continuingperception o f success on the ground. These conditions are taken into account inthe project
design, but will requireconsistent effort on the part of all operating entities.

There i s clear support for the CIP program from the lowest to the highest levels of government becauseof
its demonstratedtrack recordo f activating local communities and constructing low-cost infrastructure and
social programs and o f supportingthe governmental consensuson the needto decentralize power. The
capacity buildingactivities, particularly at the tehsil and community levels, are crucial to the longer-term
sustainability o f the programand the highest priority i s beinggivento these activities.

Considerable attention hasbeen given inthe project to O&M as communities are responsible for all
routine O&M and are requiredto contribute three percent (3%) of capital costs annually to maintain
projects and to create O&M committees to ensure that projects are adequately maintained. Many o fthe
subprojects inCIP 1have been completed only recently, but the provincial government and the TMAs
involved inCIP-Iare monitoring developments inthis area closely and following up with public
information campaigns andtraining to be sure that adequate attention i s given to project operation and
maintenance. Water supplyprojects have alsojust been completed and procedures for the more
complicated O&M systems that these projectsrequire are beingdeveloped. Finally, there is ample
evidence o f success on the ground. The project evaluation study o f CIP Ishowed that the program i s


                                                        9

providing infrastructureat a savings of 35-40 percent (35-40%) compared to more standard, centralized
procedures. Survey data from the study suggest that there is a strong perceptionof success on the ground.
Eighty-threepercent o fpeople inproject communities perceivedthat there were time savings due to
projectroad construction, 76 percent perceived that environmental conditions had improved, 80 percent
thought that the overall look of the community had improved, 50 percent thought that illnesshad declined
and73 percent thought that the overall quality of life hadimproved.

5.         Critical risksand possiblecontroversialaspects

The C P i s now a well established and provenprogram. The major risks for this project lie inthe
decentralization process and, particularly, the ability to forge new and effective relationships among the
new local government institutions and to strengthen their capacity, particularly at the tehsil level.
Particularly important inthis regard will be to work with the newly-electedbodies to secure their support
for programactivities. The experience under the first project inworking with the six pilot TMAs has
been very encouraging inthis regard, but also made it clear that there i s a needto addressthe capacity of
the TMAs more carefully inCIP-11. Great care have beentaken duringappraisal to incorporate clearly
the new working relationships inthe finalization of the Operational Manual. Substantial efforts are also
being made to ensure that the LGE&RDDhas the capacity to provide strong technical support and
training to the Tehsils and takes great care inselecting new Tehsils to qualify under the new criteria for
assistanceinundertalunginfrastructure projects and social programs.

APPRAISALSUMMARY

6.       Economic and FinancialAnalysis

Openmenu: The difficulty inundertakingex-ante costhenefit andcost/effectiveness analysis for this type
o fproject is due to the key strength o fthe project design, i.e. the project will implement a devolved and
decentralized demand-driven "open-menu" approach for sub-projecthervices selection. It i s difficult to
quantify the benefitsbecausethe types of services andrelatedinfrastructure investments insub-projects
willnotbe known withcertainty, untilthe CIP-I1is well underway and specific decisions have beenmade
at the local level by the empowered communities. The methodology to work around this uncertaintyis as
follows:

         0    The economic analysis firstly ascertainsthat communitiesunder CIP-I1would seek schemes
              or types o f sub-projects similar to CIP-I. Under CIP-I1the same or improved selection criteria
              and conditions apply i.e. (i) transaction cost, (ii)
                                                                 minimumcontributionper HWper scheme,
              (iii)
                  maximum investment levelsper household, (iv) minimumnumber o f households per
              scheme, (v) minimumcommunity contributionper scheme (20%). This results inCIP-I1
              community-identified schemes that are similar to CIP-I interms o f output, quality andeffects.
              With the CIP-I1programand CIP-I1 schemes o fthe same design, costingandquality, as
              under CIP-I, the expected scheme andportfolio economic benefits, quality, andperformance
              standards will be similar to CIP-I and the CIP-Iindependent ThirdParty Evaluation findings
              are then usedto estimate yields andbenefits o f CIP-I1Schemes
         0    CIP-11also maintains the same 33/67 ratio o fprimary vs. secondaryworks andwith similar
              transaction cost, a similar overall CIP-I1portfolio will emerge. A cost/output or least cost,
              and a cost-effectiveness assessment was made comparing the effectiveness of the new CIP-I1
              implementationmodality with a PMUdirect implementation modality. On the basis of
              effects of schemes piloted through TMA implementationunder CIP-I, it can be concluded
              that at least equal cost-effectiveness will be achieved under CIP-11. Inaddition CIP-I1will
              have positive governance effects.
         0    Inthe financial analysis itis ascertainedthat sufficient counterpart fundsandcommitment are
              available to carry out CIP-I1through the TMAs

CIP-I C'B Analysis: An economic analysis was carriedout inthe independent third-party evaluation
study ofCIP-I(December 2002). The report andthe findingswere endorsedbythe Government and the
Bank. These findingsare complemented with the findingso f an updated (August 2003) TMA capacity
assessment. The economic analysis was carried out for 6 completed CIP-I schemed sites. The economic
costs and benefits were assessed for a stratified random sample o f 10 communities, out o f the total
number of 90 schemes and communitieso f CIP-I. Impact assessment surveys with comprehensive social,
institutional, and sustainability questionnaires were conducted ineach of the 10 communities/sites.

NPK EIRR,Scheme Benefits: Recordedbenefits from 6 completed schemes were higher economic
activities, reduced depreciation o f vehicles, fuel saving, increasedvalue o fhousesand reduced
transportation cost for inboundoutbound farm commodities due to improvedroads and linkages. One
wealmess o f the survey inCIP-1i s that time savings for collecting water were not measured, or included
inthe analysis. Ifthiswere done, the ERRwouldbehigherthanindicated. Thiselement willbeincluded
inthemonitoringofCIP 2. Provisionofdrainsor streetpavementresultedinbetter hygienic conditions,
improvedhealth, higher work-efficiency and reducedmedicalbills.Details, assumptions and a sensitivity
analysis, underlyingthe C B analysis are presentedinannex 9. On the basis o fthe sample of six
completed sites anda very conservative approach to quantify benefits of increased value o f agricultural
land o f the areas benefited, assuming an average farm size, appreciation invalue o fresidentialhouses and
reducedmedical bills, ERRSwere calculated and ranged from 25 percent to 75 percent. The B/C ratio i s
positive for all communitiesat the cut-off rate o f 15 percent that is usedby the Planning Commission.
ERRfor the urbanlocalities is calculated at 75 percent and 71percentrespectively. The highreturnin
these localities i s attributedto the relatively higher appreciation inthe value o f farm land andresidential
houses.

New Implementation Modality: With similar selection criteria the implementation modality under CIP-I1
will yieldthe same portfolio, types o fsub-projects, and economic benefits. The transaction-cost, to
identi@, select and implement schemes under CIP-11, will be of the same order or better as under CIP-I.
Thenew implementationmodality will notresult inachangeinscheme cost andC B profile and(i)               the

under CIP-I, and (iii)    sufficient fiscal space andcommitment at TMNCCB andprovincial level is to be
available to meet the required counterpart cost.

Cost-Effectiveness, Direct vs. TMAImplementation: By keepingtransaction costs ratios at least the
same as under CIP-I, andby ensuring similar program and scheme cosu'contribution ratios, i.e. primary
vs. secondaryworks, overheads vs. infrastructure, the share o f contributionsby stakeholders, it is
expected that cosu'output profile andportfolio o f CIP-I1will be the same as under CP-I. There is a need
to assess, ifunder the CP-I1TMA implementationmodality - at least - the same timeliness, efficiency,
quality of outpuu'outcome and effectiveness can be realized. This can be achieved on the basis of CIP-I
pilot experiences. Under CIP-Ieight schemes were pilotedthrough the TMA implementation modality in
six TMAs. Three TMA-implemented schemes were includedinthe third-party evaluation and an
assessmentwas made o f the TMA performance compared with the PMU-directly implemented schemes,
interms oftimeliness, efficiency, quality andcost-effectiveness. The comparisonshows that quality,
effects and outcome o f the TMA-implemented pilot-schemes met at least the same standards of the
schemes implemented directly by CIP PMURSU, and therefore the implementation modality through
strengthenedand upgradedTMAs/CCBs can yield schemes that arejust as cost-effective and
economically beneficial. This conclusionis supported by a TMA-capacity-assessment (August 2003)
when TMA leadership confirmed their commitment.

Effectiveness Indicators: Cost-effectiveness of the PMU-direct-implementationmodality and the TMA-
implementation modality was assessedthrough a range o f efficiency andeffectiveness indicators. Itwas
demonstrated that the TMA-implementation modality does not yield an efficiency or effectiveness that i s
less than the PMU-direct implementationmethod. Note: A major and systemic added advantage is that
the CIP-I1will be investing inTMA andCCB implementationcapacity. Thus, while deliveringthe low-
income low-cost community basic-infrastructure and services, CIP-I1will be contributing, at the same
time and ina significant manner, to the Government's Devolutionprogram. The cost/ effectiveness
achieved inTMA implementedpilot-schemes inCIP-Imatches the standards o f PMU-direct-
implementation.Note: These standardsare to be further specified and refined and are to be included inthe
CIP-11OperationalManual as threshold values, to ensurethat the requiredminimumstandards interms o f
cost-efficiency, processing, and cost-effectiveness continue to be achieved throughout the CIP-I1
implementationperiod.

Sustainability: Sustainabilityof seven PMU-directly implementedschemes and three TMA-implemented
schemes were also compared inthe third party evaluation. An overall weighted sustainability assessment
showed equal performance andwas basedon the following factors:

                      CCB's ability to establish an office
                      CCB's ability to manage its office
                      recordkeepingability o f the CCB
                      CCB's ability to train people,
                      TMNCCB capacity for community motivatiodmobilization
                      Community perception on its infrastructure
                      the community's ability to act collectively through the CBO/CCB
                      CCB's ability to identifyand manage environmentaleffects
                      the community's ability to identify and manage environmentaleffect

                      the quality o f workmanship o f infrastructure,
                      the quality o fmaterials usedfor infrastructure
                      CCB's ability to collect O&M (3% o f secondary works), and
                      CCBs ability to charge HHon monthly basis and collect bills.

The assessment showed that sustainability of the three TMA-implemented schemes scored equally well or
better thanthe CIP sustainability average. Note: The fact that TMA and CCBs are permanent features in
the LGO set-up, provides potentiallymore and better guarantees to capitalize on benefits from
community-executed -O&M due to the stringerTMA budget linkages, that are expected to complement
the CIP-11interventions. This potentially increasesthe impact, relevance and sustainability o f the TMA
implementationmodality and CIP-I1schemes.

ConclusionEconomic Analysis: Effective CIP-I1implementation, with TMAs as implementing agencies,
requires capacity buildingo fTMA's administrative, technical, community development, and of TMA
staff skills. Effective capacity buildingwill ensure CIP-I1 schemes with an EIRRcomparable to CIP-I
schemes. This capacity buildingalso contributes systemically to the broader devolution and poverty
reduction objectives o fthe Government..

FinanciaIAaalysiss: CIP-I1projectsaportfolio of 586 CIP-I1schemes, mobilizingall 61TMAs. The
financial analysis inAnnex 9 andthe table below show that the requiredgovernment budget and cash-
flow can be available for effective financial implementation with sufficient provincial fiscal space and
commitment available to ensure allocation and timely release of; the GoNWFPprovincial counterpart
funds for primary works (30% ofvalue primary works), their shareinthe overhead costs of CIP-11, timely
allocations o f the requiredTMA counterpart funds for the secondary works (10% o f value o f secondary

works), and ability o f CCB and communities to contribute their share (20% o fthe value o f the secondary
works) andthe O&M requirement (3% o fvalue of secondary works).

Conclusion-Financial Analysis: Onthe basis ofthe NWFP Provincial Finance Award, and the Budget
Estimates 2003/04, sufficient counterpart budgetseems to be available at Provincial and at TMA levels,
the latterrequires about Rs900,000 p/acontribution for threeyearsto implement an averageof9.6
schemes per TMA. If the Tehsils' own resourcesand ifa "buy-in" by UCs can be activated, a
disproportionate use by CIP-I1of available Tehsil funds could be avoided. The ability and willingnessof
TMAs to contributeout oftheirbudgets the requiredCIP counterpart funds, was endorsed and supported
inTMA consultative workshops heldlate 2003.
Fundflow: The project would be implementedby CCBs and TMAs. PCSU would coordinate activities
of the project, consolidate financial reports received from the TMAs and transfer funds to the TMAs from
the Special Account andAssignment Account. Advances to TMAswouldbeprovidedupfront from
Government's funds. Bank's share of eligible expenditure would bereimbursed on submission of
Withdrawal Applications. Furtherdetails along with a FundFlow chart are inthe Financial Management
Manual.


Needfor capacity building: Financialmanagement arrangements proposed for the project seem
satisfactory ifadequate staff is deployed, capacity buildingundertaken inthe weak areas and scope of
internal audit expandedto cover the CCBs. TMAs needto be fully staffed to deal with the workload
resultingfromthe number of schemesto beundertakenundertheir aegis. Communities also needto be
trained inbasic accounting to be able to maintain accounts. All payments at TMAs (including
reimbursement to CCBs) would be pre-audited by the LFauditors. Since the LFauditors are not aware of
Bank's procurement guidelines, they will have to be trained inthis respect.

The LGE&RDD through the PMU-CIP has implementeda Bank financed project inthe past and there
have not been serious audit issues. Auditor General would conduct external audit of the project. TMAs
would submit supporting documents inrespect ofreimbursement claims and these would be kept at the
PCSU for review bythe external auditors. Bank's new audit guidelines have been explained to the
Director General Audit (NWFP), however, complete details o f the new audit policy would have to be
presented indetail ina workshop.

7.       Technical

The Operational Manual will set standards, whichprovide that schemes mustdemonstrate improvements
benefitingthe majority o f householdslaclang service; conform with planning, design and construction
standards suited and affordable to local communities; and have implementationarrangement consistent
with provenimplementationcapacity. Efforts will be madeto ensure that communitieshave access to
trained technical staff ineachof the major areas where they plan infrastructure projects and service
programs. Under the new project, it i s expectedthat a number of skilled staffwould be reallocated to the
TMA underthe decentralization policy. Fundingisbeingprovided, which is beingusedto further
strengthen local government staff and help the CCBs prepare suitable sub-projects. There i s a need to
establishmore appropriate technical standards, which arebeingrefined (community contractingbasedon
successful practices o f CIP) for inclusioninthe revisedOperational Manual.

8.       Fiduciary

As inthe CIP1, the project size is linked to the Government ofNWFP's capacity to finance its share of
allocations to the PCSU and local government levels (TMAs). Project sustainability would be provided
for by a community commitment to finance a minimum20 percent community contribution to capital
cost and 100percent of O&M costs of community infrastructure (internalhecondaqdtertiary) with the
provincial and local governments taking care o fthe external/primary infrastructure. Financialanalysis
shows that the provincial government can afford the cost of the project and that low-income communities
can afford to meet their obligations under the project. The size of projects ineachcommunity will be
limitedby a per capita ceiling beyond which the community would bear the full cost of the investment.
The level o f services provided will vary with the capacity of communitiesto pay for different standards of
service.

Financial accountability will be assuredby tehsil level review o f community proposals; supervision by
tehsil staff; financial training of the LGE&RDD/PCSU/RCSTs, tehsil and CCB staff; the establishment
and operation of effective monitoring and evaluation, accounting and auditing systems; and community
participation infinancial monitoring.

For internal auditing, senior auditors (at least 2) at the provincial level will submit internal audit reports
on a regular basis directly to the Secretary, LGE&RDD. They will also beresponsible for undertakinga
physical stock count o fthe Project's fixed assets and ensuring complete maintenance of the books o f
accounts. The accounts and financial statement of the Project for each fiscal year ending June 30 will be
audited by the Auditor General o f Pakistanand submitted by December 31each year to the Bank. These
reports will bemonitored inthe Audit Reports Compliance Systemo f the Bank.

Qualified and experienced financial staff will be put inplace at all levels of the project to ensure that the
requirements with regardto internal controls, accounting, financial reporting, procurement and
disbursements are met. Duringproject appraisal, improved arrangements for a sound financial
management system were agreed to and incorporated inthe Operational Manual for the project.

9.       Social

The CIP is an on-goingprocess, which involves the active participationof a wide variety of stakeholders:
the members of the local communities, existingCCBs and NGOs, private firms and groups, government
agencies and elected officials at all levels. The formation ofnew CCBs i s a highlyparticipative process
involvingas much o f the local community as possible includingits women and other less advantaged
groups. The elected local council will also be involved inthis process. The approach involves the
following: (i)  local members of the community are encouraged through information dissemination


                                                        18

campaigns to define the problems, devise practical solutions and form CCBs ina community action
planningprocess; (ii)    selecting communities basedon human, financial and O&M commitments; (iii)
integratingphysical, social and economic components with the leadership o fthe CCB; and (iv) continuing
to incorporate and strengthen the role of women inall aspects of the program. Implementation
arrangementswould be documented ina Memorandumof Agreement (MOA) betweenthe CCB and the
tehsil government.

The project seeks to increaseparticipation of and benefits to community members includingall ethnic,
gender and economic groups through their labor and financial contributions. Key outcomes include:
improvements inliving conditions through enhancedaccessto sub-projects organized around social and
community assets; confirmed changes inlocal government attitude towardpartnership collaborations and
NGOs; increaseinnew development activities initiatedby the CCB and other members; sound
management o fproject assets; increase innew development activities initiated by the CCB and their
members; andincreasedparticipationofwomen indevelopment activities. NGOs and other civil society
organizations are invited to participate inall phases ofpublic deliberations including information
campaigns, public meetings, workshops, training sessions and social assessments. Qualified NGOshave
been engagedto undertake consulting activities of various kinds. As indicated inthe monitoring section
o f this report, social performance indicators have been identified and will be closely monitored during
project implementation.

A screeningprocesswill ensurethat landas aresource is usedefficiently. Involuntary land acquisitionis
not envisaged. The project will ensure a process for monitoring the land donation and will make certain
that the land is donated only when needed, i s voluntarily done and not under pressure. A grievance
redressalmechanism will be inplace. Furtherdetails of the process and monitoring mechanism are
documented inthe Operational Manual.

The Project has designed and will implement an M&E systemto ensure that: (i) implementation
                                                                                   scheme
complies with agreed schedules; (ii)  timely feedback on implementationis generated and ongoing
problems identified to enable adjustments / improvements to be made; (iii)    quality o f the activities are up
to agreedstandards; (iv) appropriate financial procedures are being followed (financial records, audit,
disbursement, andprocurement procedures, etc.); and(v) lessons from ongoing activities are documented
for data collection and records keeping.

To ensurethat the M&Esystem will meet its objectives, eachactivityhcheme shall include: (i)          clear
statement of measurable objectives; (ii)  clear sets of expectedproject outputs; (iii) sets o f indicators
                                                                                      clear
to measure/evaluatethese outputs; and (iii)   provisions for data collection andrecords keeping. All of
these (objectives, outputs, indicators, etc.) have been developed under the project and will be refinedfrom
time to time duringthe projectperiod.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E)o f the Project and the community schemes will be a shared
responsibilitybetween the communities, the project coordinationand support unit, the participating
TMAs, andexternal evaluators to be contractedbythe Project.

Several measureswill be undertaken to ensure that communities themselves take a strong role in
monitoringtheir own schemes. This i s considered essential for the success of the decentralized approach
to community financing and project management and as an important support to communities to own
their schemes. The Project will be specifically monitoredat the level of the TMAs and at the
PCSU/RCSTs level. Processmonitoring and beneficiaries' assessment as well as stakeholder perceptions
on the performance and implementation of their schemes, including their experiences with the Project
functionaries will also be undertaken. This will inparticular look at participation of the community and



                                                      19

that of women. External evaluation will also be done to have a structured andneutral opinion about the
project interventions. Furtherdetails have been given inthe Operational Manual.

Gender: Keepinginview the low level ofgender indicators inPakistanandparticularlythe NWFP as
measuredthrough the socio-economic indicators of the Multi Indicator Cluster Survey as well as the
Gender EmpowermentMeasurement indicator ofUNDP, additional efforts are requiredto address the
basic concerns o f women. Inthis context the project has a multiprongedapproach. Firstlygender i s
mainstreamed inall project activities (involvement inCCBs, decision inscheme selection, prioritization,
location, etc). However, keepinginview the conservative nature o f the society and segregation of women
along with prevalence of the purdahsystem, it would be unrealistic to expect women and mento sit
together and form a single CCB (where the literacy level and social norms allow, it may be done). Ithas
thusbeenrecommendedthat it shouldbemandatoryfor the charter ofthe CCB at the time ofregistration
to include the presenceo f a separatewomen's sub-CCB as part of the mainmale CCB and the women's
sub-CCB be treated at par with the male interms o fbeingconsulted and included inthe decision making
process of the CCB.

Additionally, the project provides a sub component entitledspecial support to women and children under
the CommunityDevelopmentcomponent. Along with the specific programs detailedinthe component,
there will be a needs assessment undertaken to highlightother needs o fwomen, children and youth that
can be addressedbythe project. Two other areas that may be included along with those already identified
inthe CD component arethat ofreproductive healthandtraining andaccessto markets for foodand
vegetable preservation. Informationand awareness on reproductive health along with provision of
training to Traditional BirthAttendants (TBAs) may also be considered. This may also cover issues such
as HIV/AIDS, STD, etc. Women councilors and women activists (where available) may be includedas
stakeholders to provide input inits conceptualization and support to take the program forward.

Inthe absence of adequate expertise on gender, service providers (as has been done inCIP I) be    would
used as a mechanism along with the staff of the project to conceptualize and implement the gender
programs.

10.       Environment

The evaluation study o f CIP-I shows that environmental impact o fnewroads and drains has been largely
positive, reducing soil erosion and eliminating drainage problems. The environmental impact of water
supplyprojects is also likely to be highlypositive, butcannot bemeasureduntilmore of these projects are
completed. Sanitation collectionpoints have been established insome communities, but more attention
needsto be given to transport and ultimate disposal o f solid waste and to strengthening the health
education component.

Schemes under 0 - 1are rated Category B under the IDA Environments Standard and thus detailed
environmental screening i s not required. However, each scheme will undergo proper environmental
screening though an Environmental Management Framework (EMF)that will provide guidelines from
tehsil to community level on environmentalsafeguards to assess, manage and monitor each scheme. It
draws uponthe resources o f the community and local government staff. The salient features of the EMF
includes, environmental screening at the level o f CCB by a committee of three block representatives and
at the TMA level by a cell headedby a sociologist (sub-project review and categorization as per IDA
guidelines). Training and capacity buildingfor undertakmgenvironmental screening of TMA staff i s a
part o f the overall EMFas lack o f capacity is a problem.

A list of environmental quality indicatorshasbeendeveloped for monitoring the issues and impacts
identified at different stages o f sub-project design and implementation. A three level monitoringplan


                                                       20

with on-going (by tehsil) andquarterly (by EPAPCSUof CIP-II) monitoring internally and six month
monitoring externally (by EPMIUCN) has beenplanned. A post for Environmental Specialist hasbeen
created inthe PCSUinstead o f the proposed post ineachTMA. A focal person would be nominatedin
eachTMA who would be trained to help communities incompleting checklists and identifying
environmentalissues. Awareness raisinginenvironmental issues would be conducted for PCSU staff,
TMAs, and CCBs. The EnvironmentalFocalPersonofthe tehsil/town will managethe EMFandthe
CCBs and field staff ofTMAs will implement it.

EnvironmentalManual and ResourceKit will be developed for use by project staff. The environmental
screening and mitigation guidelines and checklists already provided inthe EMFwill berefined and
expanded and includedinthe EnvironmentManual andResource Kit for use by project staff.

The NWFPEnvironmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) cannot act as a service provider duringpreparation
and implementationo fthe project. Giventhe nature of the project and the applicable environmental
standards 6 monthly monitoring could bereplaced with internal monitoring and follow-up of projects
through the environment coordinator and support from EPA wherever requiredby law (for EWIEE).
However EPA hasbeen agreedto provide the following services on cost basis:

    e    Provide drinkingwater quality testing for CIP I1schemes and follow-up testing once the schemes
         are operational;
    e    Undertakeheavy metal analysis (arsenic, fluoride) etc.;
    0    Provide and share provincial guidelines being developed for CIP type schemes; and,
    e    Coordinate EPA awareness raising campaigndactivities with CIP 11.

The World Conservation Union (TUCN), which i s assisting the EPA indeveloping the guidelines, has
agreedinprinciple to trainproject staff and communities on the guidelines untilthey are notified.
Thereafter, NGOs and private sector can use them for training and awarenessraising. Since IUCNworks
ina few districtswith its own fundingit would chargea standardizedrate for providingresource persons
for training inCIP.

11.      Safeguards

Since the size o f infrastructure projects will be limitedby the eligibility and financing criteria, no large
scale impacts are expected. The applicability o f the safeguardpolicies to the project has been determined
inthe social andenvironmental assessments. There arenoknownindigenouspeopleinthe project except
for the KalashinChitral. The project does not envisage any intervention inthis area. Thus OD 4.20 on
indigenous people does not apply. This was confirmed at the stakeholders workshops held subsequentto
the social assessment conducted. OP 4.12 on Involuntary Resettlement is not expected to apply to this
project as only schemes inwhich land or property i s donated or vacated on a fully voluntary basis would
be eligible for project financing.

UnderCIP Ivoluntary landdonationwas a common feature ofcommunity development activities in
NWFP.This processwill be followed under thisproject also. Incaseswhere landis donatedby the
community: (i) landwill be identified by the community (ensuring its appropriateness for project
                the
activity); (ii)
              the voluntary nature of the donation will be verified from the person(s) donating land; (iii)
there shouldbeno encumbranceson the land; and (iv) insituations of loss of income or displacement,
verification will be obtained from affected parties) that community devisedmitigation measuresare
acceptable. Landtransfer will be officially recordedinrevenue registers through 'Iqranamas'. Pest
Management Plan and Dam Safety Management Plan do not apply inthis project.




                                                        21

No significant cumulativeenvironmentalimpacts are expected. However, localizedimpactsmay occur,
for instance the impropersittingof a water supply scheme, andthey will bemitigatedthroughthe
adoption of appropriatescreening anddesigncriteria, supervisionandmonitoring(see details inthe
EMF).Guidelinesfor arrangementsfor the borrowerto address safeguardissues havebeendescribedin
the EnvironmentalManagement Framework anddetailed out inthe project's OperationalManual.

Thekey stakeholders are: low income communities, officials andstaff ofDistrict/ TMA, tehsil andunion
council, NWFP-LGE&RDD, otherrelated agencies, NGOs andprivate firms/groups. It is anticipated
that the community memberswillparticipateinproject activities byjoiningthe CCBsandneighborhood

Thirty-two percent of Pakistan'spopulation live inconditions of absolute poverty, manifestedby low
levels o f literacy, highincidence of malnutritionand diseases, and low labor force participation. Low
incomerural and urban communities live inunservedor underserved settlements with poor environmental
conditions.

Residents suffer from a range of diseases causedby polluteddrinkingwater, poor sanitation, and
inadequate provision o fhealth care. Seasonalillnesses, like colds and flu, as well as malaria, diarrhea,
and dysentery are common. A 1998 census shows that only 34.58 percent of the rural populationhas
access to piped water supply (house connection) while more than 65 percent fetch water from communal
sources. These indicators of poverty are particularly pronounced among women who suffer from deeply
rootedcultural and institutionalconstraints that prevent them from attaining their full potential and in
playing a significant role incommunity development. However, the Government o f Pakistan (GoP) has
now realized the urgent need for a newpolicy approach and strategy to address this problem. Several
positive actions have already been taken inthis direction since the beginning of this decade, includingthe
Government's recent effort to promote and /or improve women's education and place inthe society.

Poverty

Poverty remains a serious concem inPakistan. With a per capita gross national income (GNI) of $450,
poverty rates, which had fallen substantially inthe 1980sand early 1 9 9 0 started to rise again towards
                                                                            ~ ~
the endo f the decade. According to the latest figures (for 1998-99), as measuredby Pakistan's poverty
line, 33 percent of the populationis poor. More importantly, differences inincomeper capita across
regionshave persisted or widened. Povertyvaries significantly among rural and urban areas and from
province to province, from a low of 19percent inthe urban areas of the Sindhprovince to a higho f44
percent inthe rural NorthWest Frontier Province.

The Social Assessment o f CIP-I1has suggestedand the village profiles (inCIP-I) indicate that per capita
income o f more than 50 percent of the populace inmost villages is less than the Official Poverty Line
(OPL) o f Rs 650 per month. This i s about Rs4,550 per month for an average household size of seven
family members. The proposed Project that i s beingimplementedinareas with poor resource and
economic base will significantly improvethe quality o f life for the majority of the beneficiaries. This will
not only improve access to assuredsupply of good quality potable water, but will also improve the
hygienic and sanitary condition of the settlements. The major impact will be on the healthconditions
reducingthe incidence o f diseases and sickness that severely affects the productive capacity. Loss o f
gainful employed workdays due to sickness reduces the disposable income. Sufficient productivity gains
will be realizedenhancing the income generating capacity o fthe population, especially those with
marginal income.

Lack of Basic Infrastructure and Services

Some progress inincreasing access to basic infrastructure and services hasbeen made inNWFP the last
few years. The CIP-IinNWFPhasprovided access to potable water to 90 communities. This still leaves
a significant deficit inwater supply coverage.

The Social Assessment study indicates that about two-thirds (63%) o f the NWFP population has access to
safe drinkingwater, 88% percent inurban and 59% inrural areas. There i s a wide disparity between
District / TMAs, with Bannu (85%) and DIKhan (81 %) having the highest access to safe water (but not

                                                    23

necessarily the largest amounts), compared with Kohistan (1l%),Dir (22%) and Shangia (44%).
                                                                     Upper
IneightDistrict/TMAsatleast 10%ofhouseholdstakemorethananhourto fetchdrinkingwater,
highestinKohistan(25% ofhouseholds). Although 68% ofhouseholdshave a toilet, much lessthan half
(39%) have a sanitary means o f excreta disposal, again higher inurban areas. Kohistanand Upper Dir
have the lowest levels (3% and 11%respectively).

Inadequate mechanismsfor sustained infrastructure and service delivery

Local governments at the District / TMA and municipal levels lack the institutional, technical, and
financial resourcesneededto address existing deficiencies inlocal infrastructure and services, let alone
expand them to meet increasing demands. Faced with these constraints, they continue to dependon the
Government o fNWFP for their operational requirements. Where infrastructure exist, local governments
fail to ensure their effective operations and maintenance (O&M), partly due to financial constraints, partly
due to institutionalweaknesses, and partly due to unwillingness ontheir part andonthe part of
communities to accept O&M responsibilities for works completedbyhigher levels o f government.

GovernmentStratesy

The GoP, inits Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (December 2003), posits a four-pronged approach to
alleviatingpoverty: (i)  achieving highand broad-based economic growth focusingparticularly on the
rural economy, while maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii)     improving governance and consolidating
devolution, bothas a means o f deliveringbetter development results and ensuring social and economic
justice; (iii)
             investing inhuman capital with arenewed emphasis on effective delivery o f basic social
services; and (iv) bringingthe poor and vulnerable and backwardregions into the mainstreamof
development, and to make markedprogress inreducing existing inequalities. The proposedproject
directly supports objective (iii).Itwill also contribute to a certain extent to objectives (ii) (iv)by
                                                                                             and
strengthening the capacity o f local governments for infrastructure and services delivery, the cohesion of
communities throughparticipatory processes,andthe role of women incommunity development.

The Government is also committed to decentralize authority to the District / TMA, tehsil andunion
council levels to enable them to work more closely with communities indeveloping and implementing
local projects. Its decentralization plan calls for new local governance structures and elections at the local
level to mobilize communities to participatemore actively intheir own development, and to inducemore
responsivenessfrom local officials and politicians. The National ReconstructionBureau, which has
spearheadedthe devolution program, requested the Bankfor assistanceinpropagating community-based
initiatives. As parto f the new local government structure, a Citizens' Community Board (CCB) will be
established ineachlocal council to strengthen the communities' role indecision-making. Inaddressing
deficiencies ininfrastructure and services, some o f the Government's previous efforts encountered
problemsbecausethe communitieswere not involved inplanning and decision-making. Insome cases,
residents didnot maintainand pay their share of the costs. However, recent projects have successfully
addressedthese problems.

                                                P A K I S T A N
                     Second NWFP Community Infrastructure Project (CIP-11)


Main objectives:The mainCIP-I1 objective is to improve the well beingo f low income communities in
NWFP, by (i)    supporting investment incommunity development activities, basic services and small scale
social andproductive infrastructure and; (ii) strengthening the roles andcapabilities o fthe new, devolved
levels o f community and local government organization to plan and deliver basic services andcommunity
infrastructure.

CIP-I1Total Costs, Coverage and Approach: The project would cost US$53.3 million(using2003
prices andan exchange rate o f Rs 58 = $ 1.0). Infrastructure investments are scheduled over 5 years
(2004/05 -08/09), preceded by a preparation year (2003/04). The project aims at infrastructure
development in586 sites and communities, covering and involving all 61 TMAs o fthe GoNWFP. Under
CIP-I1the TMAs are to become the implementing agencies, with the CIP-11-PCSUprovidingpolicy
advice, facilitation and coordination support. The CCBs will represent the communities andtake on the
role previously playedby the CBOs, with regardto infrastructureinvestment and the establishment o fan
O&M fund. The project is ambitious inscope as it aims to include all 61 TMAs o f the NWFP. CIP-I1will
establish low-cost infrastructure in586 communities, and it will contribute at the same time ina
comprehensive and significant manner to the Government's poverty alleviation targets, andto a systemic
development and strengthening o fthe new devolved LG system. A clear approach has been developed to
ensure the gradual and steady co-optation andintake o f all TMAs andthe respective CCBs andtheir
communities.

The Approach: To realize the CIP-I1 objectives andto meet the output targets, a clear and economical
implementationapproach has been designed. The approach is characterizedby:
         A primary focus on delivery o f 586 low-cost community infrastructure schemesin61Tehsils, to
         be achieved through a gradual and steady intake o fTMAs and CCBs in4 rounds, duringa period
         o f 5 years.
         A CIP-infrastructure-focusedcapacity-buildingprogramand mobilizationof 61TMAs andthe 586
         CCBs. Coordination o f the CIP-I1TMNCCB capacity-building inputs with the inputsfrom other
         donors and government agencies, will be channeled through the Capacity-building Coordination
         Boardof the GoNWFP and directly with the relevant line-departments and donors involvedin
         strengthening the NWFP LGsystem. The additional support measures aimed at realizing the
         synergy effects o fthe community-infrastructure investment and development scheme will be
         determined by the specific needs andpotential o f each community
         Time-efficient and effective implementationprocedures and collaborative structures that yield on
         time quality and low-cost infrastructure schemes as identified by the communities, with flexible
         and economical project supervision, coordination, monitoring, accounting and intemal
         (performance) audit arrangements.

Project Components Description:

Component 1: LocalInfrastructure and Services (Sub-CI Schemes)

The objective ofthis component is to increaseaccessto basic infrastructureand services ofthe ruraland
peri-urban communities inNWFP. It involves the rehabilitation of existing infrastructure, the construction
of new infrastructure, and operation andmaintenance (O&M), with priorities to be established in
consultation with the CCBs, recognizing that overall priority will be accorded to rehabilitation and O&M.
A menuof infrastructure to beprovided is presentedbelow. These are essential community infrastructure,
mainly secondary and tertiary networks. Trunk infrastructurerequired to ensurethat basic infrastructure




                                                      30

function efficiently would also be included. Activities to be financed underthis component include
capacity building for systems design and supervision, civil works and equipment.

This component would be demand-driven. Communities would be offered anopenmenuo fthe
infrastructure development schemes andaskedto select according to their demand andpriority.
Appropriate design and construction standardshave been developed, taking into account locally available
materials, ease o f construction, maintenance andaffordability. The project would involve communities in
planninginfiastructure layouts, service levels anddesign standardswithin certain cost ceilings and
techmcal criteria, and choosing among altemative solutions.

Past experience with community infrastructure suggeststhat the top community priorities typically include
water supply, drainage, access roads, and solidwaste facilities, although further demand surveys will be
conducted for each site under the Project. Demandhas also beenexpressedfor other types o f
infrastructure, some o fwhich may contribute directly to community incomes (e.g. small-scale irrigation) or
to a reduction inwasteful household expenditures (e.g. fuel-saving technologies). The menuo f community
infrastructure that canbe considered for funding under the project includes:

a)       WaterSupply (US$1.43 million): Water inrural areas is suppliedbyvarious means including
stand posts, hand-pumps, wells, andthrough individual and sharedconnections. Inlarger rural
communities and inurban andor peri-urban areas, tube-wells andreservoirs, constructed andoperated by
PHED, serve the distribution systems (these are due to be devolvedto the Tehsil under the law, but this has
yet to be implemented). Insome cases, especially inthe hills, water is supplied directly from rivers or
springs, through gravity systems. Inhigher density areas the distribution pipes are often surface-laid,
routed along and across drainage channels, andoften submerged inpollutedwater. These pipes are prone
to damage and, with frequent negative pressures, the water supply is often contaminated. Rehabilitation o f
distribution andtrunk systems and source rehabilitation to rectify these problems, as well as augmentation
wouldbe eligible under the project. Portability o f drinking water, especially where supplied fiom rivers,
would be tested, andremedialmeasurestaken where appropriate. The Project would finance the
construction o f new, or up grading o f existing supply facilities.


to carry both storm and gray & black water (the latrine program is expected to minimize the amount o f
b)       Drainage (US$ 7.16million): Comprehensive open channel drainage systems will be constructed

sewage solids). System design will allow for the fact that some sludge will continue to be discharged to
the drains.

c)       Internal Pathways,Foot Bridges, StreetPavements, StreetLighting (US$15.75 million): In
rural areas, access is typically provided through a network o f narrow, generally un-paved paths, sometimes
flanked onboth sidesby open ditches. Traffic includes hand- or animal drawn carts, andbicycles. The
network o f roads andpaths within urban settlements is similar to those inrural areas but with significantly
more traffic. The main and secondary accessroads inurbanareas are generally paved, but often lack
maintenance.

Improvementsunder the project will be limited to pavingo f existing streets and footpaths. Appropriate
functional planning, design and construction standardswill be used, andlayouts will ensure that access and
associated drainage is provided to the internal areas o fblocks where the poorest residents often live.
Locally available construction materials will be used. Concrete will be used insteeply sloping sites and
where storm water flows are significant. Asphalt or triple surface treatment (TST) will only be used for
access andwider streets. There appears to be a higher demand for footbridges inmountainous areas where
they can save considerable time.

d)       Solid WasteDisposal (US$1.43 milZion): Brick-built containers (collection points) will be
constructed andcoverage designed to appropriate standards. The design will allow for easy filling and
emptying. Communities typically donate sites (approx 4 sq. m. each), and only those voluntarily offered
willbe accepted. The primaryinfrastructure will be linkedto the overall collection arrangements o fthe
Tehsil, and will comprise part o fthe community action planand incorporatedinto a signed MOA. Local




                                                      31

transport carts (hand-or animal drawn) inperi-urbanareas will be usedas necessary and can be financed
underthe project.

e)       ProductiveInfrastructure (US$2.86million): While most o fthe infrastructure described
elsewhere is productive inthe sense that it contributes to time or expenditure savings, some infrastructure
can directly contributeto additional income for the community. The following are examples o f
infrastructure, which benefits the community as a whole (or a significant number o fhouseholds): (i)     small-
scale irrigation works, ii)small-scale hydel, iii)workshops for crafts or other productive activities.

f)       Trunk Infrastructure (US$14.11million): Trunk infrastructure would include off-site
infrastructure andinfrastructure serving morethanone community. Examples include: (i)          water tube
wells, bulk transmission, storage and distribution, ii)flood protection, sewerage, and iii)rehabilitation o f
existing community facilities to support women and children.

As inmostpublic infrastructure inPakistan, communities wouldnot contribute directly to the cost oftrunk
infrastructure, butwould be financed from the grant component from the Province (up to approx. 70% o f
total local scheme infrastructure costs, the remainingbalance contributedbythe Tehsil (10%) andthe
community (20%)) Trunk infrastructurerequired to allow secondary andtertiaryinfrastructureneedto be
inplaceprior to implementingproject-financedsecondaryor tertiary infrastructure. The technical and
economic feasibility o f off-site infrastructure will be assessedifits costs exceed a threshold amount. Off-
site infrastructure must also be shown to conform with and contribute to the overall Tehsil infrastructure
network planpreparedbythe Tehsil Planningunit. Once a community and the Tehsil have determined,
through the CAP, that a component o f off-site infrastructure is a priority, its development will proceed in
parallelto the community andresource mobilization activities (the only componentof infrastructure,
where this prioritypermitted). The planning, design andconstructionstandardsare includedinthe
Operational Manual, including O&M responsibilities.

g)       Household Technologies (US$0.50million, coveredby the trunk infrastructure allocation):
This component would comprise activities operatedby eachCCB, which would provide materials for pilot
testingto households for technologies which relate to and canbe implementedby individual households to
improve family health and safety, andreduce wasteful household operating expenditures, especially inthe
areas o ffuel andrepairs. The activity will also linkthe CCB andhouseholds to existing bank and non-
banking organizations for caswmaterial credit. The types o f technologies offered have been tested and
demand for themprovenby well-established NGOs, including the Aga KhanNetwork (the BACIP
program). These technologies are affordable to low-income households andcanbe made by local
entrepreneurs. They include (i)    double pit latrines, ii)fuel-saving technologies such as efficient cooking
stoves cumwater heaters, roof lighting/ventilators, solar cookers, wall androof insulation, iii)earthquake-
resistant technologies such as metalmeshreinforcement for walls and light-weight roof construction, iv)
mudwall stabilization. Awareness-raising for households andassistanceto local entrepreneurs to make
these simple technologies for sale to households would be undertaken by experienced NGOs, together with
a small number o f matching, grant-assisted demonstration projects undertaken inconjunction with partner
households.

h)        Operation and Maintenance Fund: Communities will undertake the responsibilities to operate
andmaintain all secondary andtertiary infrastructure, and someprimary infrastructure (depending on
agreements made with the Tehsil and, where relevant, the District/ TMA). Inorder to ensure community
commitment and capability to do so, on application to the Tehsil for a scheme, each householdwould
deposit an average o f Rs. 500, plus a monthly contribution o fRs. 15 into an O&M fund operated by the
CCB. The Fundwould maintain a balance through the monthly contnbutions and the proceeds would be
used for routine maintenance and small repairs.

Component 2: ImprovingLocal LevelPerformance

a)       Sub component:Institutional Strengtheningat theLocal GovernmentLevel (TMAs),and
Community Level (CCBs)(US$4.23 million): This is anessential element, which would be started at
the beginning of the program. Strengthening would focus on four aspects: (a) developing the capacity to
manage service deliveryand community development o ftwo main groups, namely: Government
functionaries at the District / TMA, Tehsil andU C levels; and CCBs focusing at the Tehsil and U C levels;
(b) introduction o fefficient collection anduser charges for services; (c) improvingtransparency and
accountability such as performance report cards andregistration, and charters for CCBs; and (d) financial
incentives for; (i) tehsil/union levelperformance inefficiently administeringtheir local service programs,
fiscal andbudgetary management; and (ii)      CCB performance inplanningimplementation andmaintenance
o ftheir local development plansandprograms. Costs noted would cover implementation assistance,
trainingandequipment.

TMAs: CIP-I1 envisagesto implement the community infrastructure investment through the Tehsil
Municipal Administrations. CIP and ISP assessedthe status and capability o fTMAs to carry out social
mobilization of CCBs andthe implementation o fthe community-identified infrastructure investments o f
the proposed CIP-11. Both are new to the TMA. CIP-I piloted 08 schemes that were implementedthrough
TMA, duringthe period 2002/2003. The assessmentsandthe actual experiencesrevealed (a) specific
weak areas inwhich the TMA is to be strengthened, (b) its relationshipwithCCB andprovincesis to be
clarified, or (c) its mandate to be clarified or strengthened.

The TMA capacity buildingprogram offers a rangeo fboth standardized and need-based /demand-driven
activities aimed at improvingthe TMAs performance and technical slulls. Inaddition basic logistics
support and incremental staff support is envisaged to enable the TMA to go through a changeprocess and
to implement the schemesincollaboration with CCBs and guided by the PCSU/RCSTs. During the
interimperiodthe TMA strengtheningprogramwill befinalized andis formally to commence by July
2004, when CIP-I1is expected to start. Requirements to meet this launch date are includedinthe proposed
interim-budget.

It is envisaged that TMA staff participate actively inthe post-scheme implementation, follow-up social
assessment andmonitoringo fthe O&M arrangements o f completed CCB/CI schemes. This involvement
will ensurethat (a) the TMA becomes evenmore convinced o fthe cost-effectiveness o f the community-
identified infrastructure investments modality, (b) the TMA will be promptedto consider complementary
development investments or linkages that may increase the returns on this basic infrastructure, inparticular
the measures, as raisedinthe EMF, on solid waste, water and the sanitation infrastructure established
underCIP and (c) the TMA is convincedofthe needto make the counterpart funds available intime for
smooth implementation o f future CCBiCIP investments.

Citizen Community Boards (CCBs): Chapter X o fthe Local Government Ordinance, 2001 provides for
setting up Community Citizen Boards (CCBs) for energizing the communities for development and
improvement inservice delivery through voluntary and self-help initiatives. This component o f LGO
encourages public participation inall areas o f development activities. The Citizen Community Boards will
contribute inproject identification, design, implementation, management and monitoringat grassrootswith
a view to improving services through bottomup planning and development process. The lessons from the
past have clearly indicatedthat the involvement and ownership o f the communities are essential for the
sustainability o fprojects and for the delivery o f quality services. The involvement o f CCBs will ensure
transparency and accountability inthe development process due to the upfront contribution o fthe
community inthe projects. Instead o fpassive recipients they will become active partners inthe
development.

InNWFPthere aremorethan 500 CCBs registered (statusasreported December 31,2003). Underthe
Institutional Strengthening Program (ISP) a number o f activities were undertaken to encouragethe process
o f CCB formation inthe province and a regular follow-up was made to ensure the 25% allocation o f
development funds for CCBs. Inaddition ISP was active partners when 7 CCBs were formed and
registered inTehsil Swabi. ISP is coordinating with the Local Government Department to provide support




                                                        33

to consolidate efforts and firther the processo f CCB formation inthe province. A registration certificate
hasbeendesigned andprinted by ISP after seeking approval from LGE&RDD to bring uniformity inthe
registration certificate. Inthis regard, aprovincial leveltraining workshop was organized for DistrictI
TMA Officers ofthe Social Welfare, Women & Community Development Department (a registering
authority) to makethem aware o frules andregulations for registration andCCB functioning. ISP is also
facilitating LGE& RDDto consolidate data on CCB andmake a permanent unit within the Department for
updating information on CCB.


b)       Sub Component: CommunityDevelopment: This includes the following activities:
     1. Social Mobilization
    2. Capacity Building
    3.    Special programs for Women andchildren

Social mobilization activitieswill focus on: a) awarenesso fthe CIP concept with community
participation at the core of all initiatives. This will also create awareness o f the participatory approach,
partnership terms and conditions (contribution o fresources, involvement inphysical works, inclusion o f
women andvulnerable groups, andresponsibilities for O&M and a delivery mechanism through TMAs
andCCBs). This aspect of social mobilization thus encompassesparticipationincommunity development
approachesfor infrastructure development.

A major objective is to support TMAs to form CCBs (where they do not exist), and strengthenthe existing
CCBs who will partner TMAs insub project implementation. Technical assistanceto CCBs will among
other, focus on community mobilization and development and implementation o f Community Action Plans
(Caps) andother implementation arrangementsbetweenTMAs and CCBs, Le. Memorandum o f
Understanding, Community FinancingAgreements, etc.

Health and Hygiene Educationprograms will target allparticipants andcomplement the water and
sanitation sub- components of the project. This will create awarenessandreduce diseasearound
infrastructure facilities andallow for direct healthbenefits ofparticipantsthat will be reflectedinimproved
social indicators. Some o fthe initiatives include campaigns, orientation andtraining programs.

SpecialSupport to Womenand Children and the Most Vulnerable will target women and children, and
the most vulnerable andstrengthen female participation indecision making at the community leveland
also improve women's capacity andhousehold lifestyles:

          i)         .
                  Training: A number o f training programs are envisagedfor women andyouth namely:
                     ..  Leadership training: Training to buildcapacity and improve performance of women
                         inCCBs andlocal level decision-making.
                         Skill development/enhancement:Provisiono f technical skills and enhancemento f
                         existing skills through training identifiedthrough Needs Assessment o f target
                         groups.
                         Entrepreneurial training: this is targeted to women interested inbusinessandwill
                         enable themto maintain proper recordkeeping, financial system and marketing.

          ii)     Linkage with micro-credit institutions: Where needs are identified, linkage will be
                  provided with micro- credit institutions to enable women to participate inincome
                  generating activities.

          iii) Supporttohouseholdsforlivelihoodimprovementandenvironmentalmanagement:Some
                  initiatives include availability o f alternative technology for cost effective fuel and energy,
                  solar stoves, water heating system, cost effective housebuildingdesigns using local
                  technology, etc.

         iv)       Support for provision o fnon- formal literacy and life skills programs, vocational training
                   andother initiatives as identifiedthrough Needs Assessment.

Component3: TechnicalAssistance, Implementation Support, andMonitoringand Evaluation
(US$5.43 million):

The aim ofthis component is to providetechnical support to the execution o fthe entire project to ensure
quality o f basic infrastructure sub-projects, capacity buildingo f implementing partner organizations and
overall project control.

At the Tehsil/UC level, the component will support pre-investment activities andsupport activities that are
not includedinthe sub-project costs, such as technical designs, inthe field support and supervision during
execution o f subprojects andphysical inspections.

At the PCSUlevel, the component will support activities to monitor, supervise, evaluate and audit the
implementation and functioning o f the overall project. Itwill also support the upgrading o f the MIS
system, as well as the provision of computer hardware and software.

Project oversight: The PCSUwill undertake project oversight andoverall coordination o f project
activities inthe participating Tehsils through its Regional Coordination and Support Team(s).

 The ProgramReviewBoard (PRE3) onrecommendation from the PCSU will approve the annual
operating plans for the project and supervise the application o fproject resourcesto the participating tehsils.

Project coordination: The TMA with assistance from the PCSU/RCST will be charged with the following
specific duties: (i) review community subproject proposals for compliance withproject guidelines and
eligibility criteria inthe operational manual; (ii) the Tehsils inensuring that the CCBs are adequately
                                                    assist

communities; (iii)   train staff inoperation and financial management (iv) prepare an annual operating plan
for the project activities inthe Tehsil and submit to PCSU.; (v) train staff inconducting community action
planning anddevelopment and implementation o f community actionplans (vi) monitor performance
through the Management InformationSystem, periodically report progress to PCSU; (vii) prepare annual
implementationandphysical performance review; and (viii) submitthe required subproject documentation
to PCSU for preparation o f SOEs to be submitted to IDA.

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E): The Project will have an effective M&Esystem to ensure that: (i)
schemeimplementation complies with agreed schedules; (ii) feedback on implementationis
                                                                  timely
generatedandongoing problems identified to enable adjustments / improvements to be made; (iii)          quality
o fthe activities are up to agreed standards; (iv) appropriate financial procedures are beingfollowed
(financial records, audit, disbursement,andprocurement procedures, etc.); and (v) lessons from ongoing
activities are documented for data collection andrecords keeping.

To ensurethat the M&Esystemwill meet its objectives, each activitylscheme shall include: (i)       clear
statement o f measurable objectives (ii)   clear sets o f expected project outputs; (iii) sets o findicators to
                                                                                       clear
measurelevaluatethese outputs; and (iii)    provisions for data generation for the impact assessment, data
collection and records keeping. All o f these, objectives, outputs, indicators, etc will be developed during
the project appraisal andwill be refined from time to time duringthe project implementation.

ProcessMonitoring (PM): ProcessMonitoring promotes continuous learningandenables refinement o f
processesthrough the project cycle. It attempts to ensure the achievement o f expected outcomes
(objectives) by evaluatingthe processes involved inproject implementation andthe quality o f interactions
among all major stakeholders, inparticular the CCBs and their members participating inthe project. While
conventional monitoringinmost projects is restrictedto the measurement o ftargets, process monitoring
assesses, for instance, how broad-based decision-making is done, how successfully or unsuccessfully
projects mobilize the participation o f women and youth, etc. The PM, which will be part of the regular

M&E systemwill document the important project processesandsub-processesthat will arise duringthe
project implementation, e.g. CCBs and TMAs partnership, cost sharing, conflict resolution, etc.

Beneficiary Assessments (BA): The BAwill beundertaken twice inthe projectperiod to assess
community as well as stakeholder perceptions on the performance andimplementationo ftheir schemes
andoverall Project itself, includingtheir experienceswith the Project hctionaries. A representative
sample o f community activitieskhemes will be selected for assessmentthat will focus on various aspects
o fthe project.

The management o f the project will be based on a decentralized demand dnven structure that relies
primarily on local Citizen Community Boards (CCBs), as the main action arm at the community
level, and the Tehsil Municipal Administration (TMAs), and the Union Councils (UCs) as the main
lower level o f govemments with the responsibilityo f providing basic infrastructure services to its
citizens. Support for creating and developing these bodies and inpreparingand implementing local
infrastructure and social programs i s being decentralized from the provincial management set-up to
the TMAs to make it consistent with GoP's decentralization plan.

The project will continue to utilize the existing structure of the LGE&RDD and the existing staff
from the CIP-I for purposes o f the overall management and coordinationo f the project and preparing
the Tehsil govemments and councils to take responsibilityfor administering the program in
communities and creating and workmg with CCBs within their boundaries. A Provincial Review
Board (PRB), an inter-agency group where all relevant agencies are represented, will provide overall
policy guidance, fiscal oversight, review, approve the budget and work plan for the program
activities.

The LGE&RDD will continue to be the main coordinating department at the Provincial level with the
         .
following arrangements:

             ProgramReview Board(PRB): PRBwill be established at the provincial levelto deal

             will comprise Secretaries of Finance, Works and Services, Planningand Development,
             LGRD, and DGCIP (who will also be the Secretary ofthe Board). There will be
             provision for co-opting TMA representatives (Nazims, Tehsil Municipal Officers
             [TMOs], etc.) inthe Boardon time-bound rotationalbasis. The Board will meet at least
             once a year or as often as required, and will be responsible for:

             -   Approval o f Annual Work Planpresentedby LGE&RDD through its Project
                 Coordination and Support Unit (PCSU);
             -   Updating and revising the policy framework, ifrequired;
                 Mobilizingresources (grant funds) for capacity buildingo f TMAs; and,
         .   --  Interagency coordination.

             Project Coordination and Support Unit(PCSU): The project will be implemented
             through the existing structure o f the LGE&RDD, where the CIP IProject Management

 -   Ensuringadherence to Social and Environmentalsafeguards; and,

.    Assessing capacity constraints and developing strategies for capacity buildingof
     TMAs and CCBs.

 RegionalCoordination and Support Team@)(RCSTs): The RCSTs (total 9 in
 number) will be the outreach arms o f the PCSU, and will act as mobile teams to assist the
 TMAs intheir work with the CCBs and communities. The RCSTs will specificallybe
 responsible for:
 --- Providing social mobilization and technical support to the TMAs;

.    Facilitatingand implementingcapacity buildingactivities; and,
     Facilitating Support Organizations (Service Providers) to work with TMAs.

 TehsilMunicipalAdministrations (TMAs): Eachparticipating TMA will set up a CIP
 core team ledby TMO, which include a social mobilization unit, and will be responsible
 for overall sub-project management and outreach to the CCBs within its boundaries in
 order to select those that are eligible and willing to participate inthe program on a
 demand driven basis. The TMA will work with the participating CCBs to develop and
 implement community action plans and projects. It will also coordinate with the Tehsil
 Council, each UnionAdministration, District and other participating agencies and/or
 groups. TMA will provide funds to the CCBs for local infrastructure(non-trunk) both
 from the fhds transferred from the PCSU as well as from its own resources in
 accordance with the project financing percentages. It will be responsible for
.implementationo f the primary (trunk) infrastructure o f each project.

 UnionAdministrations (UAs): UAswill be responsible for informingthe CCBs on the
 CIP I1community infrastructure program and rules, and help them to identify projects for

.inclusion inthe program. It will also facilitate and monitor the implementation o f the
 projects as mandated by the LGO.

 CitizenCommunity Boards(CCBs): CCBs are voluntary organizations formed at the
 community level, and are required to be registered under the provisions o fthe LGO and
 the guidelines issued for this purpose. They will be the mainpartners at the community
 level for determining local investmentpriorities for social services and local
 infrastructure, and for preparing community action plans based on the priorities. They
 will also be the main implementation partner for social programs and local infrastructure
 components o fprojects. As with the CIP I,     a general criteria have been agreed for project

              investments, which would be selectedon the basis ofproposals from local communities
              facilitated by their respective UA and appraisedby the TMA. Any CCB could apply for
              assistance,providing it meets the criteria set by CIP 11.

The CIP-Iwill bethe mainsource of staff andoutreachpersonnel for the CIP-I1to assistthe TMAs
and their partner CCBs. The recruitment process will ensure that at start up all staff can be inplace
at all levels to meet the requirements for specific program skills, internal controls, accounting,
financial reporting, procurement and disbursement. A staffing plan will be finalized and agreedat
appraisal. The PCSUi s to set up mobile RegionalCoordination and Support Teams (RCSTs) to
ensure that the programbecomes an integralpart of the participatingTMAs and CCBs development
plans, including establishing coordinationlinkages with the respective DistrictlTMAs. Particularly in
the first two years, assistanceto eachTMA and CCBs will focus on capacity strengthening,
identification, planningand implementation of community sub-projects. The capacity strengthening
plan has been finalized and agreedduringPC-1 clearance andduringappraisal by the IDA/World
Bank team.

The project will be budgeted inthe annual Public Sector DevelopmentProgram (PSDP) of the
Government o fNWFP as an identifiable single head budget itemeach year, showing boththe local
and foreign resources of funding. Initially, the provincial government Finance Deparhnent will make
the funds available inadvance from the provincial budgetresources to meet at least 20 percent of the
annual requirement through the Accountant General (AG) inthe shape of Revolving Fundsto the
spendingunitat the provincial, Tehsiland CCB level. This advancewill be deposited inabank
account to be operatedjointly by the designatedofficials and adjustable on completionofthe
respective scheme or completion of the program at the PCSU level. The conditions for the release of
the revolving funds include: (i)    an approved Annual Work Plan; (ii) o f administrativeapproval

The CCB will be the implementing partners at the community level. The CCBs will determine their
local investment priorities for community and social services and local infrastructure and voice their
priorities to their respective UCs and TMAs. As with the CIP-I, general criteria has been established
for project investments, which would be selected on the basis of proposals from local communities
facilitated by their respective U C and appraisedby the TMA.

Staffing

The Govt. o fNWFP has over the last 7 years developed a cadre of CIP staff, experienced in
developing community-local government partnership for provision of basic infrastructure and
municipal services. It was agreedbetween the IDA and GoNWFP that the CIP experienced staff will
be carried forward and involved inthe preparation, design and top-coordinative supervision of CIP-I1
inline withthe devolvedstructure ofgovernment. TheGoNWFPhasagreedto absorb CIP Istaff
into the CIP-I1by renewingtheir contract, as they are already inplace and are carrying out the
requiredpreparatory activities to commence CIP-I1implementation.

However, additional staffing and consultants to be contracted under the Project will provide
administrative and technical support to the PCSU, RCSTs and TMAs would berecruitedthrough
open and transparent procedures agreedwith the World Bank.

ProjectImplementationProcessesand Community Sub Project Cycle

CommunityInfrastructureDevelopmentProcess

Community Infrastructure investments are scheduled over 5 years (2004/05 - 08/09), preceded by a
preparation year (2003/04).       The project aims at infrastructure development in 586 sites and
communities, covering and involving all 61 TMAs o f the GoNWFP. Under CIP-I1 the TMAs are to
become the implementing agencies, with the CIP-I1 Project Coordination and Support Unit (PCSU)
providing policy advice, facilitation and coordination support. The CCBs are to represent the
communities and take on the role previously played by the CBOs, with regard to infrastructure
investment and the establishment of an O&M fund. The project i s ambitious in scope as it aims to
include all 61 TMAs o f the NWFP. CIP-I1will establish low-cost infrastructure in 586 communities,
and it will contribute at the same time in a comprehensive and significant manner to the
Government's poverty alleviation targets, and to a systemic development and strengthening o f the
new devolved LG system. A clear approach has been developed to ensure the gradual and steady co-
optation and intake o f all TMAs and the respective CCBs.

Therefore, the vital prerequisite for the commencement o f Community Infrastructure Sub Projects is
the capacity buildingand selection of TMAs, since the TMA level is CIP-I1Program implementer.
Once the TMA is strengthened and selected, the Community Infrastructure Sub Project
ImplementationProgramwould commence with the identification o f CIP-I1sites.

The development process at the community level would comprise;

 (i)      awarenesscampaign, identification, mobilization and organization;
 (ii)     community participation in preparation and design, through a community action plan with
          engineering design assistancefrom the TMA andRCST.
 (iii)    implementationo f community development programandbasic infrastructureworks ;and,
 (iv)     operation and maintenance o f completed assets includingmonitoring and feedback.


                                                  53

It has been planned that community development activities and basic infrastructure in most
communities would be phasedover a number of years, supporting a gradual development o f capacity
o f TMAs, CCBs, community members' priorities, and affordability constraints. Each sub-project
would have a development cycle o f between two to three years. The following community
infrastructuredevelopment processwould bereviewedperiodically through stakeholder workshops:

        Identification (1-3 months) -selection of sites andinitialsite visits;
        Preparation (3-6 months)-promotion of project activities, organization and formation/
        strengthening o f CCBs, agreement of priorities and initial design o f programs and projects;
        and community agreement on Community Action Plan (CAP) and signing o f Memorandum
        o f Agreement (MOA);
        Implementation(6-9 months) Infrastructure schemes, community development programs,
        health andhygiene education and CCB capacity building.Initiatives would includetraining,
        community resource mobilization, project designand procurement. Final output for this phase
        are completed community development andhygiene education programs, completed
        infrastructure schemes and established arrangementsfor 0 &M.
        Operation:(2- 6 Months) hand-over of assets and initiation ofcommunity responsibility for
        O&M.

As part ofthisprocesseacheligible community with assistance from the CCB andTMA as well as
from the RSCUand other partners, prepare a Community Action Plan (CAP), which would be
approved by the TMA with the help o f PCSU, and which would be subject to review by IDA
missions.

More details of CAP processi s giveninthe OperationalManual.EachCAP would include:

    (i)     the CCB organizational structure, includingoffice bearers, relateduser groups, and
            committees, membership representation of women' and minority groups' interests,
    (ii)    an assessment of the community development and basic infrastructureneeds;
    (iii)   a statement of investment and O&M costs, sources of funding and time table for resource
            mobilization;
    (iv)    arrangement for cost sharing, collection, safe keepingand accounting o f community's
            contribution; and
    (v)     an implementationplan, including arrangementsand a timetable for procurement,
            supervision and monitoring and evaluation.

Community/Sub-Project Size: InCIP-I larger communities (3000 & above population) were
selectedand providedrequiredphysical, social infrastructure and capacity buildingactivities. CIP-I
implementedcommunity participatory sub-projects costingup to Rs.30 million. Experience shows
that holding dialoguedmeetings and carrying out participatory planning and development effectively
insuchlarge communities andmassmeetingsisa very difficulttask, with available resourcesand
staffing constraints of the TMAs.Moreover, the elected representatives demand thin spreadingwide
spreaddistribution o fTMA resources.




                                                  54

Therefore the size o f each sub-project inCIP-I1will be smaller thanit was inCIP-I, targeting the top
priority service identifiedby the community, to ensure improved quality ofparticipation, democracy
and transparency within the CCBs. This i s inline with the TMAs approach.

Schemes shouldnot be so small that they are inefficient to design and administer or fail to extend
neededservices to sufficient numbers of people. On the other hand, they shouldnot be so large that
the community loses a sense o f control over the development process, or that overall project resources
are concentrated intoo few areas. Ingeneral, communities inhilly areas are smaller andmore
dispersed, and are larger andmore concentrated inthe plains. Therefore a scheme should serve a
minimumnumber of 100householdsinhilly areas, and200 households inthe plains. Exceptions may
bemade invery remote locations inthe hillswhere poor communitiesmay be under 100, but an
absolute minimumo f 50 households should be maintained. Experience under CIP-Ihas shown that
numberofhouseholds per scheme can increaseupto 1,400 households when schemes are
implementedinthe "mature" and well-endowed TMAs.

Community InfrastructureSubProjectImplementationModalities

The CIP-I1i s to gradually cover the whole province and all 61 TMAs, through four rounds of
community sub project implementations. The implementationrounds andTMA intakes are scheduled
as follows:
        Round1:InYear 1,per July 2004, CIP-I1will commence withbetween 9-15 TMAs that
        have already been involvedinthe CIP-I programas pilot-TMAs or that have been graded as
        A. Capacitybuildingfor the TMA will thusbe limitedand will take place during2003/04,
        The PCSU is to make sure that the necessarypreparation and CCB formation has taken place
        in2003/04, to ensurethat infrastructure investment can commence per July 2004.
        Implementation is expected to take two years.

    0   Round2: Inyear 2, startingJuly 2005, CIP-I1will take inthe secondbatch of 17TMAs.
        These TMAs are graded B andthey will have received a one year capacity buildingprogram
        duringyear 1(2004105) ofthe project. Although atwo-year implementation period(years 2
        and 3) will be scheduled, there is time for extension into year 3 o f the project, ifrequired.

    0   Round3: Inyear 3, starting July 2006, CIP-I1will take inthe thirdbatchof 17TMAs.These
        TMAs are gradedB andC andtheywill have received a one year (or less) capacity building
        programduringyear 2 (2004/05). Implementationo f construction with these 18TMAs is
         expected to take two years (years 3 and 4), but extension can be made into the final year of
        the project, ifrequired.

    0   Round4: Inyear 4, startingJuly 2007, CIP-I1will take inthe fourth of 12 TMAs,who have
        been graded as type A or C. These TMAs will have received their capacity buildingduring
        year 3 (2005106) and are expected to complete the schemes within a two-year period. These
        TMAs are to ensurethat the target of586 schemes will be metbythe endofthe project
        period.

The workload refers to construction period of CIP-I1 schemes implementedby the TMA. A
maximumthree-year implementationperiodhas been scheduled to ensure completion, including the
commencement o f O&M arrangements. Prior to these three-year periods, the TMA and CCB will
undergo a capacity buildingprogramthat may be as short as 6 months for TMAs andCCBs that are
well endowed (Grade A or C) andready for CIP schemes implementation, or that may extend upto
one year for (Grade B) T M A s that are not well endowed with insufficient number o f staff with the
required skills (including a lack o f CD skills) or for areas where CCBs are still to be created and/or
mobilized to undertake implementationof CIP-I1schemes ina proper manner.

The aim i s to include all 61 TMAs o fNWFP at the start o fyear 4 of the project. The timings are
basedon the experiences withCIP-I and the fact that under CIP-I1the need for a PC-1 for each
schemewill bereplaced with an annual CIP-I1work plan approval modality, covering all the
schemes to be started andunder implementationthat year. The Annual work planmodality is
explained below.

TMA Wide PromotionalCampaign: Once the TMAs are selectedfor eachRound o f Community
Infrastructuresub-project implementation, TMA wide promotional campaign will be conducted to
raise awarenessof the project, This will involve public education and information dissemination
through written materials (brochures, pamphlets, posters, informationkits, etc.), the mass media (print
advertisements andradiorrV broadcasts), and District I TMA seminars and workshops, District I
TMA stakeholder seminarsandworkshops for Provincial, District I TMA and local authorities;
CCBs, NOOs, community representatives; academic I training institutes; local private contractors;
etc. will be organized to promote greater understanding of the objectives and organizational structure
o f the project, the types of schemes supported by the project, scheme selection and eligibility criteria,
conditions for funding(with emphasis on community participation, community roles, contributions
and obligations), rules andprocedures involving scheme identification, preparation, application and
approval.

An informationkitcontainingall relevant information, including application forms and all other
relatedmaterials (application guidelines and procedures, menuof eligible schemes, selection criteria,
etc.) will be made available at the relevant TMA Community Information Desk of CP-11.

CommunityExpressionofInterest: Applications for infrastructure schemewill be submittedto the
TMAusingthe standardapplicationforms. The TMA will enter information onthe scheme
applications inthe Project's Management Information System (MIS) database andmake them
available at the Community InformationDesk at TMA. Every application will be assigned a code in
the MIS that will serve as an applicationidentificationnumber (to be agreedbefore actual adoption).
The original applicationwill be kept inthe main files of the DOs I MCs, and copies will be passedon
to the PS.

Selectionof CIP-II Sites: CIP-I1sitel community selection processstarts once the Community
Expression o f Interests(CE0I) are received. This processincludes field visits, short listing of CEOIs
and prioritization usingSite selection Criteria. The Th4A site selection would finally submittedfor the
Steering committee for approval

II. PARTICIPATORYPLANNING/PREPARATION)(3-6 months)

Prerequisites: The essentialprerequisites for the commencement ofthis Community Participatory
PlanningPhase of CIP-I1Implementation Cycle are:
    a) CIP-I1sites/ communities selectedand informed
    b) Selectedcommunities are sensitized andready for CLP-I1implementation

RapidNeedsAssessmentand CommunityAction Planning: Followingstakeholder workshops and
seminars, as part of community actionplanning exercise, field visits to the communitiesto conduct
rapidneeds andcapacity assessment (RNCA) will bemadeto enable CCB members and other
community leadersto articulate and confirm their community infrastructureimprovements and
community development needs, and to assess their capacity for leadership, organization, and
cooperation. Since the idea o f applying for assistance for community schemes under the project
should come from the community, the first step leadingto a scheme application must be for the
community to decide, ina participatory manner, on its own needs and priorities. To ensure that these
are systematically and objectively assessedandprioritized, the community action planning (CAP)
approach would be adoptedby the TMA field teams working with the community. CAP not only
ensures that community members are involved inscheme identification and decision-making; it also
buildscommunity ownership ofthe schemes they selected. The minutes andattendancerecords of
these meetings will document that the CAP process has taken place.

While the TMA field teams will be directly involved inthe rapid needs / capacity assessment and the
CAP process, this small core team may not be able to cover all communities. As part of its
Community Development and Decentralized Planning and Implementation Assistance components,
the project will engage service providers (e.g., NGOs, training institutes, local consulting groups, etc.)
to provide technical assistanceinfacilitating the CAP processesand other community development
activities inthe selected communities.

As a result ofthe CAP process, communities that have identified solutions to their priority problems
shall prepare and finalize their CAP which will provide details of the specific infrastructure (e.g,,
water supply, sanitation, etc.) and complementary community development schemes (e.g., health and
environmental sanitation training for women and children, etc. ) for which they seek funding under
the project. The CAP will include inter alia: (i) CCB, BRsand relatedcommittees (ii)
                                                    the                                       an

time table for resource mobilization, arrangement o f collection and safekeeping, and accounting for
the community's contribution,; and (iv) an implementationplan includingarrangementson timing
scheduling for procurement, supervision, monitoring and evaluation, and operation and management
arrangements.

Formationandor Strengtheningofthe CitizensCommunity Board(CCB). TheTMA Fieldteam
and RCST shall assist the community to for" strengthen CCB. The CCB members (representing the
community) shall prepare and submit the applications for the schemes they have selected. Training
will be conducted inthe community to: (i) the responsibilities and obligations expected of the
                                              clarify
CCB inproject implementation, including the role of women; (ii)      clarify and fulfill institutional
requirements for registration; (iii)  buildskills inproject execution, including financial management,

DeskAppraisalwill be conducted to determine ifscheme applications: (i) documentation
                                                                              meet
requirements(completed applicationforms and other requireddocumentation); and (ii) within thefall
scheme categories and meet eligibility and appraisal criteria.

A conditional approval for the proposed scheme shall be granted after communities have expressed
interest, basedon key eligibility criteria, i.e. need and willingnessto share costs, before one engages
inCAP analysis andthe establishmentofCCBs]

After Desk Appraisal the applications are entered inthe MIS system with the following options: (i)
recommended for field appraisal; (ii)    deferred to be improved by the community applicant (the
community can request for technical assistance); or (iii)   rejected. Ifthe application does not meet the
preliminary selection criteria, it should be returned to the applicant communities with a letter from the
TMA stating reasons for rejection. The list ofrejected proposals should be sent to the PS for
information. Ifthe proposal meets the preliminary criteria but requires further information, a request
identifying the information neededi s sent to the applicant communities. Ifthe proposal meets the
preliminary selection criteria, it i s assigneda project registrationnumber and included inthe projects
pipeline for appraisal.

FieldAppraisalwill be conducted to assess: (i) the scheme reflectsthe community's priority needs
                                                    if
andhas full community support (signatures andor fingerprints of community members who attended
CAP meetings shouldbe attachedto scheme application forms); (ii)        community capacity and
commitment to contribute to scheme costs, to participate in scheme implementation, and the
capability of CCB; (iii)community preferences on suitable service providers (where the community
does not have adequate institutional capacity) to provide assistanceto the community; (iv)
compliance with technical, social, economic, financial and environmental conditions, criteria, norms
and standards and (iv) further needfor community training, capacity building, and technical
assistance.

The field teams / contracted service providers will prepare the appraisal report to be submitted to the
TMO o fTMA with a copy to RSCU.

Approvaldecisionswill bemadebased on appraisal reports. For community works which cost up
to $30,000 the TMA will make the decision whether to approve or reject the application or to require
modifications, inwhich case a conditional approval can be granted. For schemes which cost more

Prerequisites: Essentialprerequisites for the commencement of scheme implementation are:

    a) Technical proposal (scheme) approved
    b) Community/ CCB is ready/prepared for scheme implementation
    c) Joint scheme account (JSA)between TMA and CCB opened/ functioning

Signingof Contract: Once a CI schemehasbeenapproved for fundingbythe TMA, a
Memorandumof Agreement (MOA),which includes a Community FinancingAgreement (CFA), shall
bejointly preparedand signedbythe TMO and the CCB. This will serve as a legal contract between
these two parties, which will specify the terms and conditions of the scheme financing and the
obligations ofbothparties (A form has been devised for the Schedule of CommunityFinancingfor
a sample MOA and included inthe OperationalManual).


                                                      61

Execution of CI scheme: The CCB, with assistance from the field teams o f the TMA, shall be
responsible for scheme execution. Inline with the procurement procedures to be followed underthe
project a procurement team, comprising a representatives from the TMA and from the CCB shall be
responsible for procuring all the human and materialresourcesneeded for the execution of the
scheme covered by the FinancingAgreement. When procuring goods and hring labor, the
procurement team must follow the tender procedures specified inthe FinancingAgreement. It shall
administer the procurement process, preparethe tender documents and bidding, and awardthe
contract.

Duringconstruction, the CCB shall supervisework and shall certify completionofwork at each
agreedwork phase. Ifrequired, qualified engineers shall be engagedby the communities to provide
quality assurance.Onits part, the TMAs will design and implement a District / TMA supervision
systemunder the project that assures regular inspection of scheme execution withinthe District /
TMA. They shall visit all schemes on aregular basisto check the progress and quality ofworks.
Uponcompletion of infrastructure construction, a rigorous procedure will be applied by the TMAs for
testing the operational capability o f all completed infrastructure schemes against specified design
standardsbefore the CCBs, with assistance from the TMA and RSCU, certify final completion of
construction work.

AnnualWork Plan

FirstYear plan : About 9-15 TMAswill be selectedas partners duringthe first year and they will
include the 6 pilot sites mobilized in2002/03. TMA and CCB assessments will be carried out and
capacity buildingundertaken. Special programs for women, vulnerable and disabled groups will be
implementedinthose sites requestingthe programs.

CIP-II AnnualWork Plan: UnderCIP-Ieach scheme hadits own PC-1 approvalprocedure.
Considerable delays were sometimes experienced to clear the scheme PC-1. A major requirementin
community development i s to maintainthe enthusiasm and momentum generatedina community.
Under CIP-II586 schemes are to be implemented. The PC-1 approval mechanism for each scheme
cannot be applied any more. The CIP-I1project design and implementationmodalities envisage
provincial approval of a CIP-I1annual work plan and the requiredbudgetary approval and support on
the following basis:




                                                  63

            clearance of the CIP-I1project funds as per PC-1, for a five year period, and its inclusion
            inthe ProvincialADP
            endorsement of the PC-1 stipulated annual capacity building inputs, schemes input
            requirements and output targets, and rates, with implementation envisaged through the
            TMAs.
        m   annual ADP clearance of the CIP-I1Annual Work plan with specification of the required
            inputs, the schemes output targets, the intake of new TMAs for that year, the deviation
            from the PC-1 annual targets and allocations due to adjustments on the basis of past
            years' performance, and the need for cashlworking capital to carry out the agreed annual
            work planwithout delay.

Monitoring Responsibilities

The responsibility for Monitoringand Evaluation (M&E) of the project and the community schemes
i s a sharedbetween the communities (CCBs), TMAs and the PCSU, and external evaluators to be
contracted by the Project.

a)       Community levelmonitoring. Several measures will be taken to ensure that communities
         themselves take a strong role inmonitoring their own schemes will be initiated. This is
         considered essential for the success of the decentralized approach to community financing
         and project management and as an important support to community ownership of their
         schemes. These monitoring measureswill include:

                   The scheme applicationformto indicate the community's monitoringplan;
                   The financing agreementsbetween the community and the project to be publicly
                   announced at field appraisal and at scheme launch;
              m    The CCB to submit quarterly and annual technical and financial reports to the TMO
                   on the scheme's progress;
                   For their part,the TMA shall monitor all project activities inthe district / TMA and
                   provide the CCBs quarterly and annual updates on the progress o f project
                   implementation inthe district / TMA.
                   The CCBs to authenticate the registers of workers, sign off on payrolls after
                   payments, and keep records of expenditure; and,
                   All accounting documents related to community scheme financing to be made
                   available to the TMAs for inspection.

b)        TMA levelMonitoring: TMA fieldteam shall supervise and monitor all schemes being
          implementedwithin their area o fjurisdiction. Using the Field Activity MonitoringForm, the
         TMA field team shallreport on their monitoring and supervision visits to the TMO andRCST
          covering;

              Physicalprogress and quality o f construction of structures and other civil works (water
              supply, sanitation, internal circulation, footpaths etc);
              Financial expenditures and accounting records;
              Stock management; and,
              Management and other implementationissues.

c)        Provincial-level Monitoring. The PCSU and RCSTs are responsible for the overall M&Eof
          all activities under the project usingthe following:
              Routine Reports: Quarterly and annual reports and audits shall be prepared to document
              the number, type, performance, and achievements of community level schemes; the types


                                                      64

       .   and amounts of community contributions, financial expenditures (procurement,
           disbursement accounts, etc.). These will be the principal source of information for the
           internal monitoring of the Project by the NWFP.
           Mid-Term Review (MTR): An MTRwill be scheduled as the project cycle rolls on to
           conduct technical, management, and beneficiary assessmentsaimed at confirming or
           revising project assumptionsand targets. The findings o f the MTR will help inthe
           planning and implementation of the subsequentphases of the project. The MTRwill rely
       .   on the statusregular status reports including project aide memoires from visits conducted
           at least twice a year and the following:
           ProcessMonitoring (PM). ProcessMonitoring promotes continuous learning and
           enables refinement of processes through the project cycle. It attempts to ensure the
           achievement o f expectedoutcomes (objectives) by evaluating the processesinvolved in
           project implementationand the quality of interactions among all major stakeholders, in
           particular the CCB and their membersparticipating inthe project. While conventional
           monitoring inmost projects i s restricted to the measuremento f targets, process
           monitoring assesses, for instance, how broad-based decision-making is done, how
       .   successfully or unsuccessfully projects mobilize the participationof women and youth,
           etc.
           BeneficiaryAssessments(BA). The BA will be undertaken twice inthe project period to
           assesscommunity as well as stakeholder perceptions on the performance and
           implementation of their schemes and overall project itself, including their experiences
           with the project staff. A representative sample o f community activities/schemes will be
           selectedfor assessmentthat will focus on the following- aspects, among others:
                =                                                       -            -
                       objectives ofthe specific community action;
                8
                .......participation of the community inidentifying and assessing the tangible benefits
                       of the project;
                1      determination of who has access to and control of the benefits of the project;
                       the nature and level ofparticipationby different categories of beneficiaries;
                       impact on beneficiaries, numbers reached and/or assisted;
                       involvement of women inproject committees;
                       use of and accounting for funds;
                       capacity of their CCBs and contracted service providers to manage scheme
                       implementation;
                8      O&M o f CI schemes;
                       the role of contractors, NGOs, and consultants contracted; and,
                       lessonslearned from the community's overall experience with the Project,

           Special Studies and Research: The Project will engage consultants or service providers
           to cany out special studies as neededto investigate specific issues affecting the project
           and / or the communities. These may include client satisfaction survey, impact
           assessment, and other special studies as needed.

d.)    External Monitoring and Evaluation.

The Projectwill be monitoredby the GoNWFP andby IDAthrough routineproject supervision
missions and project reports. Inaddition, the project will contract out special studies and research
work inorder to evaluate project performance and its impact on the beneficiaries.

Eligibility and Selection

Adequate safeguardsand care will be taken to ensure that community infrastructure development
investment options are chosenby the beneficiary communities inaneutral fashion and to elicit as
wide and active stakeholder participation as possible indeterminingpriorities. Communities and sub
projectswill be selected on a need- and demand driven basis. Priority will be given to assisting
communities that have the potential for meetingthe criteria at different levels described below:

A. TMA eligibility and selectioncriteria:
As per the newly enactedLocal Government Ordinance (2001), inevery Tehsilthere shall be aTehsil
Municipal Administration (TMA) which shall be a body corporate and consist o f a Tehsil Nazim,
Tehsil Municipal Officer, Tehsil Officers, Chief Officers and other officials o f the Local Council
Service and officials of the offices entrusted to the Tehsil Municipal Administration. Inevery town in
a City District / TMA there shall be a Town Municipal Administration (TMA) which shall be a body
corporate and consist of the Town Nazim, Town Municipal Officer, Town Officers, Chief Officers
and other officials of the Local Council Service and officials of the offices entrusted to the Tehsil
Municipal Administration. TMA i s the main government body at the local level. The local
community sub project-implementing arm of the CIP I1i s the TMA, and all TMAs are potential
partners o f the project. TMAs are selectedinfour batches adopting the selection criteria givenbelow:

        Agreeable to CIP-II approachand methodology: The TMA should agree to implement the
        projects according to the C P I1approach and methodology, project design and other terms
        and conditions.
        Financial strengthand cost sharingaffordability andwillingness:The PCSU of CIP-I1
        will keep close contact with the partner TMAs and will assess their existing financial
        strength. The TMA mustbe willing to contribute at least 10% share towards the capital cost
        o f community infrastructure schemes/ sub-projects. The TMA should also be willing to
        provide technical support (designl surveys) to communities for the physical infrastructure and
        helpwiththe execution of community development (CD) activities such as trainings.
        Humanresources strength:The PCSU would evaluate the available humanresources of the
        TMAsto confirm that well equipped, trained and supportive staff is available for undertaking
        physical and social activities according to the approved work plan of CIP-11.
        Logistics:To ensure on time achievement of social and technical objectives, the CIP I1 -
        would also examine the existing logistic capabilities of eachTMA. This may include
        transportation, office arrangement, computer, telephone, fax etc.
        Willingnessfor Community Infrastructure and O&M Arrangement: Those TMAs
        willing to implement community infrastructure as per CIP I1criteria and to carry out future
                                                                     -
        O&M will apply for the partnership inwriting.
        Performanceof TMAs: Followingthe CIP-II/TMA capacity buildingtraining, the TMAs
        are expectedto performbetter. Inaddition a CP-I1performance-based incentive scheme will
        promote enlargement o f the schemes portfolio for those TMAs that meet these performance
        criteria.
        Willingnessfor women participation in developmentprocess:TMAs shouldbe willing
        and inaposition to assist the women -the vulnerable group to participate inthe community
        development program.
        Institutional capability:The capability ofTMAs indecision making policies, meeting
         intervals, intra and inter coordination among different tiers of the TMA etc.
        Partnershipagreementwith TMA: After selection ofthe TMA for implementation of CI
         subprojects o f CIP -11, the PCSUwill enter into a written partnership agreement with the
        TMA.

B.       Site SelectionCriteria
The criteria for site selection arebasedon, amongothers, poverty/equity considerations, a minimum
size o f settlement, a clear process ofneedddemand basedarticulation of community priorities for
services, priority to areas lackmg infrastructure, willingnessand capacity to contribute towards
infrastructure, existence/formation of a CCB, technical, social and economic viability and the gender-
equity contribution of the scheme. Specific criteria are listedout below:

e   FeltNeed: The services/ infrastructure must address the felt needs ofthe beneficiary
    communities.
e   ParallelProgram: There shouldnotbeproposedongoing or recently completed similar parallel
    C Iprograms/ projects.
e   Population:Minimumsize ofthe settlement inthe hilly areawould at least be 100householdand
    above, while inthe plain areas, the minimumnumber o f households would be 200 and above.
e   Willingness and capacity to contribute: The beneficiaries should be willing andhave the
    capacity to contribute 20% of the secondary works as well 3% of the cost for the operation and
    maintenance purposes.
e   Equity:The gender, political, socio-geographical andracial differences may notbe considered in
    the contributionand site selection of the scheme.
e   Socio - economic,technical & environmentalviability: Socio -economic, technical and
    environmental viability of the site must be examined.
e   Smallsize projects: Projectsof smaller size with low cost andhighimpact should be given
    preference.
e   Demonstratecommitment: Priority should be given to those communities demonstrating
    commitment through their capacity for social organization, ownership and cost sharing
    contribution.
e   Maximumbenefit:The scheme shouldbenefitmaximumpopulationinthe community.
e   Lackof basicinfrastructure:Priority should be given to those communities lackingbasic
    infrastructure.
e   Existence/ formationof CCBs: The selectedcommunities shouldhave CCBs representingall
    segments of the community. The TMA would be askedto facilitate the formation of
    representative CCBs ifnone already exists.

CCB eligibilityandselectioncriteria

As per the newly enacted Local Government Ordinance (2001) citizens inevery local area may set up
a Citizen Community Board, (CCB). This would be a group o f non-elected citizens, wanting to
energize the community for development and improvement inservice delivery.

Under CIP 11,communitiesinthe selectedsites arerepresentedby the CCB through Block
representatives ofthe beneficiary community. Itplays a vital role that was playedby the CBOs in C P
I.

InCIP-I1itwillbepossible to suspendor stop operations inthose sub-projects/ schemes where the
standardsof quality o fparticipationare not being met.The CIP-I1and TMAs shouldnot be under
pressureto disburse funds, merely for the sake of achieving financial targets, while compromising
quality. The CIP-I1project does not stand for continuation ofpartnership with inefficient or
immaturepartner institutions. The specific criteria for CCBs inthe CP-I1project are listed out below:




                                                    67

A CCB, according to the Local Government Ordinance (LGO), consists o fa general body and a
steering committee. While there can be several different kinds o f CCBs, under the LGO, the CIP-I1
project will onlv fumish funds for those CCB that match the following eligibility criteria.

1. LegalRegistration:The CCB should be a registered body under the Local Government Ordinance
2001 or willing to register itself under the same act. Thus the CCB must be in compliance with the
requirements inthe LGO

2. Representative andParticipatoryCCBs: The general body for the "CIP-I1 eligible CCB" should
be a representative body covering all segments o f the community. The general body would then elect
5-11CCB representatives who will voluntarily look after the affairs o f the CCB.

The CCB should represent a fair section o fhouseholds inthe community including women and other
vulnerable groups. [A CCB that merely represent one or few extended families or a political group
will notbe eligible.]

At least 25 percent ofthe households, which the CCB purportsto serve, mustbe represented, either
directly or through a nominee, inthe CCB general body. 25 % o f these individuals mustbe women.
The CCB general body will elect 5 - 11representatives to a CCB steering committee. There must be
at least 1and preferably 3 women representative inthe CCB council. A CCB that only represents
one/a few extended families or interest groups will NOT be eligible.

The CCB must be able to give credible proof o f its repetitiveness through the use o f minutes/
participant lists.

Participatory:Along with being inclusive the CCBs are also required to be participatory. This will
also ensure transparency intheir functioning together with the communities they represent. The CCBs
will also needto work with the Councils and Committees as envisaged under the LGO.
    Participation will be measuredby the following criteria:
     1. The CCB council must meet withthe general body at least once per quarter (3 months).
         Ideally, the general body should meet once per month
     2. The CCB must keep minutes o f its meetings both o f the council and the general body.
The CCB must keep strict financial records that should be publicly available.          All receipts for
purchase o f goods, labor, or any sub-contracts awarded must be kept in original form. These records
shouldbe readily available to any community member, or CIP I1staff.

3. Agreeingwith the CIP I1approach and methodology:
The CCB should agree to the CIP I1approach and methodology, project design and terms and
conditions

4. 20% Community Contribution: CCBs must be willing to contribute 20% cost o f the physical
work.    The community will also take full responsibility for Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
purposes. In order to take over the responsibility o f the O&M financially and technically the CCB
mustprovide 3% o f the capitalcost towards the completion o fthe sub-project/ scheme.

5. Adequate Female Representation: There should be willingness for the female representation in
the CCB. If women are not members o f the CCB their representation in the CCB can be secured
through a female CCB that i s an adjunct o f the male CCB. Women's demands /needs must be
addressed by the CCB in its schemes. This may be through soliciting their needs and ensuring that
designs are gender sensitive, (e.g. location o f infrastructure or required services). Women's opinion



                                                    68

must also be included in scheme prioritization by the CCB. Women councilors should also be
accessedconsulted to address gender concems of the area.

6. Councilmeeting:The council of CCB should holdmeetings regularly, at least once every quarter,
preferably once a month. The council of CCB should be open and transparent to the block
representatives and the general public

7. Formationof sub committees:The CCB should be willing to the formations of sub committees
for intime completion ofproject and smooth monitoring purposes.

8. Willingnessto work withthe TMA: The CCBs are a partner and the implementingarm of the
project and henceneedto work closely with the TMAs, and where feasible also coordinate with the
ucs.

9. Willingness to undergo capacity building: With the new role and responsibilities of the CCBs,
their capacity will need to be built. Their willingness and commitment to participate in capacity
buildingwill bereflectedbytheir attendance.

Informationand CommunicationStrategy

The CIP I1project is designed to be within the framework o fthe LGO and with the reforms program
o f the GoNWFP. The reformprogram is puttingspecial emphasis on the implementation ofreforms
withthe following aims and objectives:
     Economic, structural, civil service and other reforms shouldbe beneficial for all making delivery
     o f social services more efficient and competitive while keeping the process transparent and
     equitable.
0    Implementation o freforms i s part o f Government's overall economic program for poverty
     reduction, minimizingpublic expenditure, enhancing revenues and establishing an efficient
     mechanism o f providing services.
     As apolicy, the Government intendsto ensure implementationand continuation ofreforms
     through grassrootsempowerment and decentralized service delivery.

0    There is interest among the various informationresources ofthe GoNWFP to ensure that its
     communicationwith the public i s done effectively.
0    The CIP- I1project needs to have a consistent, strategic external information and communication
     function for the following reason:

The general public and politicians at all levels will be interested inaproject involvingcommunity
infrastructureservices to low-income communities, because it i s an important event inthe affected
communities, buteven more importantlybecausethe need is so muchlarger than the
communitiesheneficiaries served inthe project period, 2004-2008/09. (A served population of 1.25
million o f a target population of 20 -27 million). Although there will be schemes inall 61 Tehsils,
there will be a large number of eligible communities not receivingthese services inthe project period.
Interest ineligibility criteria and basis for selection must be expectedto rise, as the project gets
known, particularly among those not beingbeneficiaries. An information strategy on how to respond
to these information challengesmust be developed. The GoNWFP has recently decided to establish a
CommunicationCenter inall districts, where updated information on demographics, various
development projects etc. will be available to the public. This will be an important outlet to bringout
information to the public on CIP-11, and particularly critical inreaching the population that i s not
among the beneficiaries inthe project period.

The CIP- I1project needs to have a consistent, strategic internal information and communication
fbnction for the following reason:

The CIP-I1project has extensive internal communicationneeds because:

The CIP-I1project has a challengingorganizational set up: Community involvement through CCB,
implementationthroughthe Local Government structure (UCs and TMAs) and facilitation by the
Project Coordinationand Support Unit inthe Provincial Govemment's LGE&RDD. This set up i s
appropriate giventhe functions that are to be fulfilled: Community capacity for handling their
development activities, delivery o f services through the existing local government and operating the
project within the country and provincial reform efforts (LGO/devolution, GoNWFP reform
program), butthe organizational set up demands a highlevel of common understandingamong the
various actors. This common understanding i s createdby information and communication. Thus there
i s a considerable need for information, communication (and training) to create a common
understanding among the different stakeholders on project rationale and objectives and the role of
each group inimplementation. Unless such a common understandingi s established, there will be a
huge potential for inefficiencies through misunderstandingsand lack o f clarity on the roles of each
group inrelationto other groups

Conclusions:

      1. The information and communication function i s critical to successfully implement the
         project.
      2. The information and communication function must be clearly identified,put at an appropriate
         level and under clear management accountability, and resourced with the necessary
         competenceto handle the mainfunctions. Hiringof consultants for the 0perativ.ework should
         be considered. Close cooperation with the capacity buildingfunction inthe PCSUmust be
         secured

      3. The main tasks for the information and communication function will be:

                  SecondNWFPCommunityInfrastructureProject(CIP-11)

Flow of Funds: The project would be implementedby CCBs and TMAs. PCSUwould coordinate
activities of the project, consolidate financial reports received from the TMAs and transfer funds to
the TMAs from the Special Account and Assignment Account. Advances to TMAs would be
provided upfront from Government's funds. Bank's share of eligible expenditure would be
reimbursedon submission of Withdrawal Applications.

Financialmanagement arrangements proposed for the project will be satisfactory when adequate staff
i s deployed from the start, and capacity buildingundertaken inthe weak areas and scope o f internal
audit expanded to cover the CCBs. TMAs need to be fully staffed to deal with the workload resulting
from the number of schemes to be undertaken under their aegis. Communities also needto be trained
inbasic accounting to beable to maintainaccounts. All payments atTMAs (including
reimbursement to CCBs) would bepre-audited by the LFauditors. Since the LF auditors are not
aware of Bank's procurement guidelines, they will have to be trained inthis respect.

The CIP UnitinLGRDhas implemented a Bank financed project inthe past andthere have not been
serious audit issues. Auditor General would conduct external audit of the project. TMAs would
submit supportingdocuments inrespectofreimbursement claims andthese would bekept at the
PCSU, for review bythe external auditors. Bank's new audit guidelines have been explained to the
Director General Audit (NWFP); however, complete details o f the new audit policy would have to be
explainedina workshop.

Staffing: Under the proposed implementationarrangements, most CIP schemes wouldbe
implementedby CCBs underthe supervision o fTMAs. PCSU would beresponsible for coordination
o f the project activities. The following financial management staffing arrangementswould needto be
inplacefor the project:

         CCBs               Secretary
         TMA                TO (Fin.) and team
         PCSU               Finance Manager andteam

The proposed staffingarrangement is appropriate ifthe relevant staff i s properly trained. Local
Government Ordinance (LGO) has prescribed the staffingrequirements for TMAs and it will have to
be assuredthat the requiredstaffi s available to the TMAs. Since there is no accounting staff at the
schemes, the Secretary o f the CCB will performbasic functions i.e. processing payments and
maintainingbank book. Payment vouchers would be sent to the TMAs where these would be
accounted for by scheme and by component. The total number o f schemes under the project may go
upto 500 or moreandthe numberofschemes under eachTMA may rangebetween 5-15; therefore, it
i s important that the TMAs' Finance departments be staffedadequately. It i s important to build
capacity of the communities, and that training be imparted inrespect o fbasic accounting and
reporting.

Budgetpreparationandmonitoring: PCSUwouldprepare the annualbudget basedon
requirements of various components as indicatedby the CCBs and TMAs for their respective
schemes. The budgetwould be approved by the Project Review Board (PRB) according to the work
plan shown inPC-1.

Expenditureundervarious infrastructure schemes ofthe projectwould beconsolidated by the
Monitoring& Evaluation (M&E) department inthe PCSU for monitoring against the budget.
Similarly, other components would also be monitoredby M&E. Planning& Development
Department will hold quarterly review meetings to monitor expenditure against the budget and also
progress under various components.

Accountingpolicies& procedures: Accounts of the project would bemaintainedusingcashbasis
ofaccounting. A financial managementmanualhasbeenprepared for the project that have been
compared (for consistency) with the accounting manual prescribedby the Auditor General of Pakistan
(AGP) for local governments. AGP's manualprescribes accounting procedures and formats o f
financial reports. The following books of account would be maintained by the CCBs, TMAs and
PCSU:

   Books of Account                                         CCBs TMAs             PCSU

Implementationarrangements:Underthe proposed arrangements, CCBs would implementthe
schemes inpartnership with the TMAs underpartnership agreements. Partnership agreementswould
also be signed between the TMAs and PCSUinrespect of CIP program. The partnership agreements
between TMAs and CCBs shouldinclude the following:
            a complete list of activities to be undertaken
            responsibilities of eachparty

 SpecialAccount: There would be one Special Account to be operatedbythe PCSU. The Special
 Account would be usedto make payments of Bank's share ineligible expenditure and would be
 replenished onregular monthly intervals or whenever the equivalent expenditures reaches 20% of the
 outstanding advance, whichever i s earlier. A Special Account (S/A) initial advance of US$ 3.7
 millionwill be established inNational Bank of Palustanto meet IDA'Seligible share of financing of
 the Credit. All eligible payments greater than one fifth o f the initial advance into the S/A may be
 submitted to IDA for direct payment to the suppliers at specific request from the NWFP CIP-11. The
 S/A will bereplenished onthe basis ofthe reimbursement requestsfor eligible expendituresreceived
 bythe IDA at regular monthly intervalsor whenever 20% of the S/A advancehasbeen utilized,
 whichever i s earlier.

 Since Special Account can not be usedto make advances to TMAs, the project expenditures to be
 incurredby the TMAs field offices would be paid out of the Govemment's ownresourcesprovided
 through the Assignment Account. GoNWFP would provide 25 % additional funds o f the total
 estimated annual expenditures, inaddition to funds providedthrough ADP, enabling the PCSU to
 make advances to TMAs. Uponthe completionof the project, this 25% additional advance would be
 adjusted, through annual ADP.

 A ProjectAccount shallbe openedby the PCSUto hold finds receivedthroughthe Assignment
 Account for meetingtheir day-to-day expenditures and to meet proportionateeligible expenditures on
 behalf of IDNGovemments shares of project financing. Deposits into this account shall be made out
 of the proceeds of the Assignment Account and reimbursement from the S/A, for the eligible
 expenditures already incurred out o f GoNWFP's financing. This Account will also be usedfor other
 receipts ifapplicable. The Project Account shall also be the maininitial outlet for makingadvance
 payments to the TMAs for carrying out primary and secondary works to be executedby them.

 TMA Account: EachTMA would opena separate account for depositingtheir own share o f
 financing and for receipt o f funds from the PCSU for implementation o f the approved schemes.
 These accounts shall be operatedjointly by the concerned Tehsil Nazimand Town MunicipalOfficer
 and shall be used for makingpayments to the contractors/suppliers and for transfer o f funds into Joint

The Community shallberequiredto deposit their respective share inthe Community Account, in

to carry out only SecondaryWorks (to be carried out by communities them). Generally, the
communities shall cater for the Secondaryworks. TMAs shall make eligible expenditures out of the
JSA and receive reimbursement from the TMA Account.

The LocalGovernment Ordinance lays downrules for CCBs that will have to be followed for the
project. Joint Scheme Accounts (average size of the secondary infrastructure i s PKR 4.2 million)
would be opened for each secondary scheme (pavements, drains, etc.) inwhich contributions from the
CCBs (20 %) and TMAs (10 %) would be deposited for incurring expenditure under the respective
schemes. The bank account would bejointly operatedby TO (infrastructure), TMA and President of
the CCB. TMA's engineerswould submit Measurement Book (MBs) and other requireddocuments
e.g. bank deposit slips, etc. inrespect of secondary schemes to TMAs where these would be checked
by the LocalFund(LF) auditors, accounted for, consolidated and forwarded to PCSU for
reimbursement (on utilization o f 75 % funds). The reimbursement claim would be checked by the
Audit Officer after which the Finance Manager would review the overall progress/expenditure in
respect o f schemes.

Paymentfor Primaryworkshchemes(overhead tanks, roads, etc.) would be implementedby the
TMAsthrucontractors who would beeither paiddirectly byTMAs (ifthey have sufficient funds) or
bythe PCSUthruAssignment Account / Special Account. Special Account would bejointly operated
bytwo signatories.

PCSUFinanceDepartmentwouldprepare the followingfinancial reports basedon datareceived
from the TMAs/CCBs:
             Status of advances from the Project Account
             Component wise utilization reports

The above reports would beprovided to the Monitoring& Evaluation Department for incorporating
inthemonthly progressreport. Finance Section ofthe PCSUwould consolidate datareceivedfrom
TMAs and submit quarterly FinancialMonitoringReports (FMRs) to the Bank. Formats and
guidelines have beenprovided to the Finance Manager - specific contents would be agreed during
appraisalhegotiations.

Internalaudit: LocalFund(LF)auditors at the TMOs carry out apre-audit ofexpenditure andpost
audit o frevenue. Since there is no accounting staff at the schemes, it is important that they should
cover the schemes under their respective TMAs. There are 146 officers inthe LocalFundAudit
Directorate. A team comprising one Audit Officer and one Auditor will be assignedto eachTMA for

pre-audit o fpayments. Reimbursements to CCBs would be pre-audited too. Revenue receipts are post
audited. LFauditors will have to be trained inBank's procurement guidelines to be able to audit
project relatedexpenditure. It was agreedthat the Bank would arrange training inthis respect.

Internal audit department reporting to the FMhas beenproposed inthe manual developed for the
project. For effective andindependent working o f the internal audit department it is imperative that it
reports to the Director General, CIP. Seniors Auditors at the Provincial level will submit directlyto
the Secretary, LGE&RDD internal audit reports onregular basis.They will also be responsible to
under take physical stock count of Project's fixed assets and ensure complete maintenance ofbooks
o f accounts, liaison with the Government Auditors and respond to the audit observations and organize
Departmental Accounts Committee (DAC) meetings.

External audit: External audit ofthe project would be conducted by the Auditor General ofPakistan
(AGP). Since the AGP does not have the capacity yet to conduct audit of TMAs, payment vouchers
pre-audited by the LFauditors (TMAs' and CCBs') would be kept at the PCSUfor audit by the DG
Audit. There were no serious issues inrespect of the projectpreviously implementedby the
implementingdepartment.

Bank's new guidelines inrespect of submission of audited financial statementswere discussedwith
the prospective FMand the Director General Audit (NWFP). It was suggestedby the DGAudit that
since the audit staff are trained inthe previous financial reporting, it may be continued for a while and
later switched to the new reporting i.e. entity financial statements with a note stating project
expenditures and bank balances. Consolidated Project Financial Statements (including Special
Account reconciliationand SOE Reviews) duly audited by the Auditor General will have to be
submitted by 31December eachyear.

Budgetpreparation: PCSUwould prepare the annual budget basedonrequirements of various
components as indicatedby the CCBs and TMAs for their respective schemes. The budget would be
approved by the Project Review Board (PFU3) according to the work plan shown inPC-1. The Project

funds available inadvance(at least25% o fannual requirements) throughthe Accountant General
(AG) inthe shape of "Revolving Funds" to the spendingunitsat the Provincial, TMAs and CCBs.
This advancewill be deposited inabank account to beoperatedjointly by the designatedofficials - at
the Provincial level: Secretary, LGE&RDDor his designated staff, and Accounts Officer (AO); at
TMA level: TMO and incase ofJoint Scheme Bank Account ofCCBsbyit's President andthe
Designated field officer o fthe TMA. The funds initiallyprovidedby the Finance Department will be
adjusted for their share on completionofrespective scheme(s) or final completion o f the Project at the
Provincial level, from the informationprovidedby District / TMAs as notedbelow. The conditions
that triggerthe initial release of funds are:
(I)      the approved Annual Planofthe Project,
(11)     copies of Administrative Approval of schemes by Secretary, LGE&RDD and
(111)    incase ofCCBs, certifiedcopies ofevidence (for cashcontribution: bank certificatehank

         contribution as per the terms and conditions laid down in the Memorandum of Understanding
         (MOU) andthe Community Finance Agreement (CFA).

MinimumAdvance Required from GoNWFPinto the RevolvingAccount: The Revolving
Account (RA) at the CIP-I1level will be advancedfunds from the GoNWFP on an annual basis. This
would be essential to ensure that funds canbe advancedto the participating TMAs for themto finance
physical infrastructure, bothCCB and TMA implemented. During appraisal it was estimated that the
GoNWFP would advance into the RA at least twenty-fivepercent o f the annual requirement for
physical infrastructure ina given year. The requirement for eachyear is basedon the number of
schemes i s shown inthe following table. The GoNWFP agreedto provide the necessaryadvance
eachyear from the Annual Development Plan.

ProcurementCapacity

An assessment of the ImplementingAgencies' procurement capacity was carriedout by a
Procurement Accredited Staff (PAS). The main findings are as follows:

The project will use some of the LGE&RDD staff of the PMU, NWFP CIP to formpart o f the
ProgramCoordination and Support Unit (PCSU) for this Project. Therole o f the PCSU will be
overall coordination, technical/ implementation support and guidance to Union Councils, Citizen
Community Boards (CCBs) and TMAs. It will activate working capital/ revolving fund to keep
implementation on track. The PCSUwill also be responsible for Monitoring and Evaluation. This
project i s ina sense arepeaterproject of NWFP CIP with the difference that the PCSU will not
implement the infrastructure schemes, as was the case inNWFP CIP I.The LGE&RDD staff, which
implementedthe bulkofthe procurement under NWFP CIP i s quite knowledgeable and experienced
inthe Bank's procedures anddocumentation.

Themainimplementationagenciesto executethe infrastructure schemes are the TMAs. Although
eight ofthese TMAs were involved inimplementationof infrastructure schemes under a pilot scheme
inNWFP CIP, theprocurement capacity ofthe majority ofthe existingTMAsremains weak. TMAs
are newly established entities that have very little prior experience incarrying out competitive
procurement ingeneral, andalmost no exposure to the Bankprocurement procedures, particularly
goods and consultants' services. The TMAs will therefore require assistanceand additional support
for adequately managing procurement under NWFP CIP-I1

The Government o fNWFP has agreedto engage at least one qualified procurement consultant posted
at the PCSUat Peshawarduringthe life o f the project to strengthen the procurement capacity o f the
ImplementingAgencies. The procurement consultant will provide procurement support to the TMAs.
EachTMA will assign at least one qualified staff member dedicated exclusively for procurement
work under the project.

The Bankwill assistincapacity buildingby conductingprocurement training workshops for key
procurement staff of the implementing agencies, before the start and duringimplementation of the
project, inorder to improve and update their knowledge of the Bank's procurement procedures. The
dates for these workshops will be mutually agreed. All key procurement staff of the implementing
agencies will be identified and trained inthe Bank's procurement procedures.

National Competitive Bidding(NCB) which are already beingusedon other Bank financed projects
inPakistan, willbeusedfor procurement ofGoods andWorks under theproject. The model formof
community constructionagreementthat has beendeveloped, with the Bank's concurrence, under
various Bank Projects (the NDP Project, the SindhOnFarm Water Management Project and AJK -
CIP Project) will be usedfor the works to be carried out through community participationunder the
Project. The Bank's Standard Request for Proposal document will be used inthe selection of
consulting firms.

All expectedprocurement of goods, works andconsultants' serviceswill be listed inthe Project's
General Procurement Notice (GPN).

CivilWorks
Itis expectedthat about 586 contracts underNCB and 1432contracts with the Community to be
executedby CCBs for small and scatteredcivil works schemes, will be procured duringthe life of the
project. Dueto the community driven nature of the project, specific contract packages cannot be
identified upfront and will be definedduring the implementationphase.These contracts are not
expected to attract the interest of foreign contractors. However, ifforeign firms wish to participate in
these contracts, they will be permitted.

Civil works estimated to cost more than $30,000 per contract shall be procured through National
Competitive Bidding(NCB) procedures acceptableto the Bank. Civilworks estimated to cost less
than $30,000 per contract may be procuredthrough community participationawarded directly to the
concerned community organization.

Goods


InternationalCompetitive Bidding(ICB) procedures shall be followed for each Goods contract
estimated to cost more than US$200,000 equivalent. Goods estimated to cost between US$25,000
equivalent and US$200,000 per contract may beprocuredthroughNational Competitive Bidding
(NCB) procedures acceptable to the Bank. Small value off-the-shelf goods estimated to cost
US$25,000 equivalent or lessper contract are expectedto be procured following
NationaVInternational Shoppingprocedures inaccordance with the Procurement Guidelines.

Improvementof BiddingProceduresunderNationalCompetitiveBidding

The following improvements inbiddingprocedures will apply to all procurement of Goods and
Works underNational Competitive Bidding,inorder to ensure economy, efficiency, transparency and
broad consistency with the provisions o f Section 1of the Guidelines:

             Invitation to bid shall be advertised inat least one national newspaper with a wide
             circulation, at least 30 days prior to the deadline for the submission o fbids;
             biddocuments shallbe made available, by mail or inperson, to all who are willing to pay
             therequiredfee;
             Foreignbidders shall not be precludedfrom biddingand no preference of any kindshall
             begiven to nationalbiddersinthe biddingprocess;
             biddingshall notbe restricted to pre-registered firms;
             qualification criteria shall be stated inthe biddingdocuments;

            post-bidding negotiations shall not be allowed with the lowest evaluated or any other
            bidders.

Consultants' Services


Contracts with consulting firms estimated to cost more than $100,000 per contract will be procured in
accordancewith Quality and Cost Based Selection procedures. Contracts estimated to cost less than
$100,000 per contract may be procured through the method of Selection Based on Consultants'
Qualifications. Contracts with individual consultants will be procuredinaccordancewith the
provisions of paragraphs 5.1 to 5.4 inSection V of the Consultants Guidelines.

Procurement Planning

Prior to issuingthe first invitation for bidsinthe case of goods and works, and request for proposals
inthe caseof consultants' services, eachimplementingagencywillprepare andprovide for the Bank's
review, updated annual procurement plans for Goods, Works and Consultants' Services. Procurement
under the project will be carried out inaccordance Procurement under the project will be carried out
inaccordancewiththe agreedprocurement plans. Procurementplanswillbeclosely monitoredand

OverallProcurementRiskAssessment

Average

Frequency o fprocurement supervision missions proposed: One every 6 months (includes special
procurement supervision for post-review/audits). There i s apotential riskinhaving a large amount of
contracting done at the community level. However, our experience with other projects including
community infrastructureprojects, has ledusto require monitoring mechanisms - mainly unwritten
social audit by the CCBs themselves, and these have considerably reduced the possibilities of things
going wrong. To further reduce risks while enhancing the level of comfort inregardto the quantity
and quality aspectso f community contracting, the following arrangementshave beenbuiltinto the
project: (a) independent audit by the Auditor General o f Pakistanwhich will also include physical
verification; (b) ex-post procurement audit by individual procurement consultants engagedby the
Borrower; and (c) technical support by the PCSU and RCSTs.

Because o f the nature o f this operation, a large number of contracts would be below prior review
limits. The project itselfprovidesfor independent audit to beconductedbythe Office ofthe Auditor
General of Pakistan for expenditures incurred, which under the newregulations will also include
physical verification. GoNWFP has agreedto engage individualprocurement consultants for
procurement capacity support, who as part of duties will also conduct post-award reviewsat the
project level and furnishquarterly reports to the Bank. Furthermore, consultants' engagedby the
GoNWFP will provide technical support and monitoring. The normal Bank requirementof ex-post
reviewof Iin 10contracts for an averageriskproject, cannot be achieved inthis project due to
resource constraints. Given the sheer numbers of contracts envisioned inthis project, the Bank's
resource constraints, the mitigating effect o f the audits mentioned above, we would consider the
"benchmark" review level o f Iin 10 contracts to be excessively large for this type of operation. The
Bankwould review as per regional guidelines, samples out of the audit reports called for inthe
project. Inaddition to a review o f the audit reports, Bank staff will conduct post awardreviews
duringSupervision missions. These reviews will beperiodically supplemented by an appropriate
allocation of random ex-post audits conducted by consultants engagedby the Region for post award
review coverage on the Pakistanportfolio as a whole.

Economic Analysis

Open menu: The difficulty inundertaking ex-ante costhenefit or cost/effectiveness analysis for this
type o fproject i s due to the key strengthof the project design, i.e. the project will implement a
devolvedand decentralized demand-driven "open-menu" approach for sub-projecthervices selection.
Itis difficult to quantify thebenefits becausethe types of services andrelatedinfrastructure
investments insub-projects will notbe known with certainty, untilthe CIP-I1is well underway and
specific decisions have beenmade at the local levelby the empowered communities. The
methodologyto work around this uncertainty i s as follows:
0   The economic analysis firstly ascertains that communities under CIP-I1would seek schemes or
    types o f sub-projects similar to CIP-I. Under CIP-I1the same or improved selection criteria and
    conditions apply i.e. (i)  transaction cost, (ii)
                                                   minimumcontributionper HH/perscheme, (iii)
    maximum investment levels per household, (iv) minimumnumber of households per scheme, (v)
    minimumcommunity contributionper scheme (20%). Thisresults inCIP-I1community-
    identified schemes that are similar to CIP-Iinterms of output, quality and effects. With the CIP-I1
    programand CIP-I1schemes of the same design, costing and quality, as under CIP-I, the expected
    scheme andportfolio economic benefits, quality, and performance standards will be similar to
    CIP-Iand the CIP-I independentThirdParty Evaluation findings are then usedto estimate yields
    and benefits o f CIP-I1 Schemes
0   CIP-I1also maintains the same 33/67 ratio of primary vs. secondary works and with similar
    transaction cost, a similar overall CIP-I1portfolio will emerge. A cost/output or least cost, and a
    cost-effectiveness assessment was of the made comparing the effectiveness of the new CIP-I1
    implementationmodality with a PMUdirect implementationmodality. On the basis of effects of
    schemes piloted throughTMA implementationunder CIP-I, it can be concludedthat at least equal
    cost-effectiveness will be achieved under CIP-11. Inaddition CIP-I1will have positive
    Governance effects.

0   Inthe financial analysis itis ascertainedthat sufficient counterpart funds andcommitment are
    available to carry out CIP-I1through the TMAs

Economic Benefits: An economic analysis was carriedout of CIP-I schemes inthe independent Third-
Party Evaluation study (December 2002). These findingswere endorsedby the Government and the
Bank. The economic analysis was carried out for 06 completed CIP-I schemeshites. The economic
costs and benefits were assessed for a stratifiedrandom sample o f 10 communities out of the total
number of90 schemes andcommunitiesof CIP-I. Impact assessment through comprehensive social,
institutional, and sustainability questionnaires were conducted ineach of the 10 communities/sites.

Assumptions underlyingthe C B analysis:

 EA Table 2. AssumDtionsCIP Cost/Benefit Analvsis
 1.     Roads were constructed in 04 out o f the 06 six sites and resulted in improved linkages. Benefits
        from roads were higher economic activity, reduced depreciation o f vehicles, fuel saving, increased
        value o f houses, reduced transportation costs inbound outbound farm commodities. Farm land
        value increases were only taken where road construction took place. Benefits from land value
        appreciation are distributed evenly over 3 year periodcommencing from year 2.
 2.     Street pavement and drains were provided in all sites. Benefits were better hygienic conditions,
        improved health, higher work efficiency and reduced medical bills.
 3.     Value assessmentswere gathered from group discussion and field visits (2002)
 4.     Costs in2002 prices from the year o f scheme completion, using a 10%compounding factor
 5.     A very conservative approachwas taken to estimate benefits
 6.     Life was taken as 10years for all works
 7.     O&M costs were set at 3% of capital cost from year 2 onwards
 8.     Average farm size was taken as 1.0 acre/HH for Hasam. Ghorazai, Sharaghund, 0.75 acre/HH for
        Hayat Khel, 05. acre/HH for Kanju, and 0.2 acre/HH for Tekhal Bala
 9.     Average house size:1Kanal (4840 Sft) rural areas, 0.25 Kanal urbanlocalities(Tekha1 B a l d Kanju)
 10.    Benefits from residentialhouses are evenly spread over 4 year period starting from year 2
 11     Savings fromthe medical bills are assumed as 25% o f total increase inyear 1, 60% inyear 2,90%
        inyear 3, andfullbenefitsfromyear 4 onward
 12     Benefits from farm land and residential houses are taken as "Nil" from year 5 and 6 respectively.
        For medical bills benefits were assumedto continue duringthe periodthe infrastructure is intact
  13    For economic analysis only 25% o f total benefits from farm land and residential houses - accruing
        to the individual- are assumedto be invested for the benefit o fthe economy.

NPV, EIRR, and SchemeBenefits recorded inthe 06 completed schemes were; higher economic
activities; reduced depreciation of vehicles; fuel saving; increased value of houses; and reduced
transportation cost for inboundoutbound farm commodities due to improvedroads and linkages.
Provision o f drains or street pavement resultedin; better hygienic conditions; improved health; higher
work-efficiency; and reducedmedicalbills. Except gastroenteritis, most waterborne diseases such as
typhoid, dysentery, cholera, hepatitis and malariahave beenreduced where water supply schemes
were implemented. Onthe basis ofthe sample of six completed sites anda conservative approachto
quantify benefits o f increasedvalue of agricultural land of the areas benefited, assuming an average
farm size, the appreciation invalue o fresidentialhouses and the reducedmedical bills, the E m s
were calculated and ranged from 25% to 75%. The B/C ratio i s positive for all communities at the
cut-off rate o f 15% that is usedby the Planning Commission. EIRRfor urban localities was

calculated to range from 75% to 71% respectively. The highreturn inthe urban localities is attributed
to the relatively higher appreciation inthe value of farm landand residentialhouses.

Implementation Conditions: Under CIP-Ithe CIP PMUand its field offices were implementers of
schemes inclose collaborationwith mobilized CBOs. This direct implementation mode and the direct
mobilization o f CBOs and communitiesresulted incertain efficiency and costs/effectiveness
standards. Under CIP-I1the TMAs are to be mobilized as the implementers and the CCB i s to be
mobilized to take on the role the CBO played. Schemes under CIP-I1can yield at least the same
economic benefits, ifunder the new implementationmodality the timeliness, efficiency, quality of
output, cost-effectiveness and outcome, interms of hardware AND social infrastructure, are at least of
the same standard as achieved under CIP-I. The TMA and CCB capacity buildingprograms are to
ensure that identification, implementation, maintenance schedules and quality o f CIP-I1schemes will
have the same standards

Sensitivity: The ERRSof CIP-I1schemes are expected to be of the same order, assuming that under
the new implementationmodality,
1. the preparation and implementationcompletion time per scheme remains the same,
2. the CIP-I1schemes and services provided from a range o f services stays the same, as reflectedby
    a minimumper HHcontributionper scheme, and a maximum total scheme investment cost per
    HH,arange ofhouseholdsper scheme andthe infrastructure types,
3. the overall investment portfolio/profile o f the project remains the same, as reflectedby the 33/67
    ratio ofprimary/secondary works,
4. the efficiency, cost-effectiveness and quality of output/outcome realized o f the hardware AND
    the social infrastructure o fthe CIP-I1programare of at least the same standard as achieved under
    CIP-I, and
5. when there is sufficient fiscal space for the requiredcounterpart funds.

New Implementation Modality CIP-11and transaction cost: The major difference between CIP-I and
CIP-11concerns the role of the CIP PMUPCSU. Under CIP-I the PMUand its field-based units were
the implementers. Under CIP-I1 this implementation role will be transferred to Tehsil Municipal
Administrations (TMA) and the role of the CBOs i s to be taken over by the Citizens Community

through TMAs and CCBs - will have the same or better transaction-cost and effectiveness as under
Boards (CCB). It i s therefore to be ascertainedthat the new implementation modality under CIP-I1 -

CIP-I

Transaction Cost: Onthe basis of a workload of 61 TMAs and 568 schemes, Table EA 5 assesses the
CIP-11budget and expected transaction costs. It can be observed that a higher efficiency i s expected
under CIP-11. Transaction cost for supervision, implementationand mobilization is being reduced
from 22% under CIP-I, (see table EA4) to 18% under CIP-11. Note: CIP-I1transaction cost were
assessedon the basis of December 2003 information. Inthe final PAD the latest costing and budget
are used, but these do not alter significantly the conclusions on CIP-I1transaction cost.

 Wider effects CIP-11Implementation mode: The transaction cost of CIP-I1includes capacity building
costs to upgrade the TMA.The mainpurpose of strengtheningthe capacity o f the local government
(TMAs) isto implementlow-income CIP-I1infrastructure schemes, butthis capacity-building also
contributes to broader systemic objectives of the devolution and poverty alleviation agendas of the
GoP and the World Bank andto strengthens capacity of a community as a whole on a longer term.
Including all capacity buildinginvestments, the CIP-I1transaction cost are still at par with the CIP-I
implementationcosts. The ratio of overhead and transaction cost to realize the CIP-I1 schemes
investments remains the same -but will probably be lower -as compared to CIP-I. Specifically
dedicated and limitedallocations inthe CIP-I1programto address broader TMNCCB capacity
buildingareas, specific target groups like women andchildren, specific development objectives or
areas like education and the introduction ofnew household technology are additional and are
excluded from the transaction cost.

Input, Output,Processing and OutcomeIndicators: To assessifthe CIP-I1implementation modality
 i sjust as, or more, effective as CIP-I, the cost to identify, select and implement sub-projects, i s to be
 compared with the standardo f the schemes or output specifications. A range o f (process) efficiency
 and timeliness indicators, andoutput quality indicators, and a cost-effectiveness of the PMU-direct-
 implementationmodality vs. the TMA-implementation modality i s presented below.
Input, Output and Least-Cost: The CIP-I independent thirdpartyevaluationreport concluded
 that the CIP-Iimplementedschemes were completed at 35% to 40% lower cost, while having
 the same - or higher - quality standards as government implementedbasic infrastructure
 schemes. This least-cost standard also applied to the TMA implemented schemes that were
pilotedunder CIP-I, as all schemes were based on the same Government Composite


                                                                       92

Measurement Rates (1999) to execute the infrastructure works. CIP-I1schemes are also expectedto
be implementedon the basis of updated Govemment Rates andtogether with the community
participation modality the CIP-I1schemes are expectedto yield acost-saving o f about 30% as
compared to other government implementedand similar infrastructure schemes.

Processing and Efjciency :The CIP-I independentthirdparty evaluationreport concludedthat CIP-I
implemented schemes had and overall efficiency of 51%. Efficiency was assessed from the
conversion (time) from inputs to activitiesto outputs. The followingtime ranges/ limitswere set; (i)
Identification, 01-03 months, (ii)
                                 Preparation, 01-03 months, (iii)   Confirmation, 01-03 months,
and (iv) Implementation, 24 -30 months, or a critical path that varies from 27 to 39 months. Overall
CIP-I implementation efficiency varied from 98% for primary works, to 97% for secondary works,
with arange from 75% to 119%. The 03 TMA -implemented pilot-schemes required a longer period
to commence with the primary and secondary works. CIP-I1targets the TMA (primary works) and the
CCB (secondary works) andit is expected that the delay instart up time will be reduced and will be at
least at par with the CIP-Irecorded implementationschedules. Under CIP-I each scheme had its PC-1
that hadto be approved by the relevant authorities. PC-1 approval periods ranged from 5 to 19
months under CIP-I. Under the CIP-I1TMA-implementation modality an Annual Workplan modality
i s envisaged, inwhich all schemes for that year are included, grouped by TMA. The group-approval
of the CIP-I1Annual Worlcplan and the schemes will greatly improve time efficient operations.


Effects and Outcome. CIP-I1is to improve the quality o f life and well-being o f low-income
communities inNWFP, this i s to be achieved by (i)    supporting investments incommunity
development activities and basic small scale social and productive infrastructure, (ii)strengthening
therole and capabilities ofthe devolved local governments to extend institutional, financial and
technical support to Community Citizens Boards (CCB), (iii)    mobilizingand empowering the CBOs
to-be-converted to CCBs, to increase their participation indevelopment activities, and (iv)
encouraging effective governance through improvements inoperational, budgetary and financial
monitoring and evaluationactivities. The immediate outcomes expected from the programare; (i)
better performance of newly elected governments inparticular the TMAs and service delivery and in
mobilizing and buildingcapacity o f CCBs to increasetheir participationindevelopment activities, (ii)
creation and strengthening of CCBs enabling local residents to participate more effectively in
development, (iii) effective governance through improvements inoperations, monitoring and
                    more
evaluation and financial and budgetary procedures; (iv) improved infrastructure and services to local
communities at lower cost with better O&M arrangements, and (v) increase inability o f community
to undertake other development programs on their own.

Cost-effectiveness: CIP-I1cost-effectiveness i s estimated on the basis o f an assessment of 08 CIP-I
schemes that were piloted in06 TMAs under a TMA-implementation modality. Three of these TMA-
implemented schemes were includedinthe CIP-I Third-party Evaluation and these findings have
beenusedas the basis for CIP-11cost-effectiveness. The TPE showed that timeliness, efficiency,
quality, effects and outcome o fTMA-implemented pilot-schemes are of at least the same standards as
schemes implementeddirectly by the PMU. It is therefore concluded that schemes to be implemented
through strengthenedand upgradedTMAs/CCBs will bejust as cost-effective and economically
beneficial, as the directly implementedCIP-I schemes.

Effectiveness: The table below compares 07 PMU-directly implementedschemes and 03 TMA-
implemented schemes inCIP-Iand shows that TMA implementedschemes are not less-effective than
PMU-directly implementedschemes. Effectiveness was measuredon the basis of surveys in 10
communities where schemes were implemented and these surveys were followed with in-depthfocus-
group discussions that allowed community membersto further clarify andrefine the survey findings.
Only on the literacy ratio improvement andthe conflict resolutionratio o fTMA implemented
schemes scored lower than the average. It should be mentioned that the TMA-implemented Schemes
modality, as assessedby the third party evaluation, didnot include the role of CCBs, as they were not
yet inexistence or mature enough to play their role. For CIP-I1much depends on the TMA and CCB
capacity development programs, that are to precede implementationby the TMAs and CCBs.
Capacity-development includes sensitization, community mobilization, and a TMA change process
that shouldresult ina TMA becomingmore responsive and enablingtowards community initiated
development schemes, the idea o f PPP, and its role as regional planner and coordinator of
infrastructureand social development, that gives due consideration to literacy and harmonious
community development. Note: The cost'effectiveness ratios achieved are to be hrther specified and
refined and are to be included inthe CIP-I1the Operational Manual as threshold values, to ensure that
the requiredminimumstandardsinterms of cost-efficiency, processing, and cost-effectiveness
continue to be achieved throughout the CIP-I1implementationperiod.

The role of the CBO included the ability to train people, the capacity for community
motivatiodmobilization; the community perceptionof its infrastructure; the community's ability to
act collectively through CBO; the Community ability to identify and manage environmentaleffects;
the CBOs ability to identify O&M scope; and the ability to charge HHon monthly basis and collect
bills. The ThirdParty Evaluationof CIP-I schemes showed that the 03 TMA-implemented schemes
score equally good or even better thanPMU-implemented schemes. Given similar conditions the CIP-
11TMA-implemented schemesaretherefore expected at leastto repeat these CIP-Icost-effectiveness
and performance standards.


Sustainability of 07 PMU-directly implementedschemes and 03 TMA-implemented schemes were

Note1:The fact that TMA and CCBs are permanent features inthe LGO set-up, provides potentially
more and better guaranteesto capitalize on benefits from community-managed-O&M, due to the
economic and development budgetlinkages, that are expected to complement the CIP-I1
interventions, and this potentially increasesthe impact, relevance and sustainability of schemes
deliveredunder a TMA implementationmodality.
Note 2: The sustainability indicators are to be specified and included inthe CIP-I1Operational
Manual (OM) as standards or threshold values. This inclusion inthe O M will ensure that CIP-I
standards interms of cost, efficiency, processing, maintenance capacity, and effectiveness, will
continue to be achieved throughout the CIP-I1implementation period. The ThirdParty Evaluation
assesseda satisfactory effect and sustainability on the basis of:


Conclusion Cost-Effectiveness: The outcome o f a CIP-I1implementation modality i s expected to be
the at least as cost-effective as CIP-I considering, the types andbenefits o f the infrastructure,
timeliness, efficiency, output specifications, quality o fworkmanship of infrastructure, quality of
materials used for infrastructure, overall quality o f the scheme, and effect and impact of a scheme.
The independent ThirdParty Evaluationshowed almost equal cost-effectiveness of PMU-directly-
implementedand TMA-implemented schemes. However, under CIP-I1a systemic, additional
enhanced effects will result from the investment inTMA and CCB capacity. While deliveringlow-
income low-cost CIP-I1community basic-infrastructure and services, CIP-I1will contribute at the
same time and significantly to the Government's Devolution program inNWFP. TMA and CCBs are
permanent features inthe LGO set-up, and this provides better guarantees for sustainedcommunity-
managedO&M. The investment inTMA/CCB capacity and implementation through the TMA i s
further expectedto enhanceeffectiveness, impactandrelevance ofCIP-I1schemes due to more

obvious and stronger TMA (development) budget linkages, that may complement and upgrade the
CIP-I1interventions.

Status and TMA Commitment:The positive economic andcost-effectiveness conclusions onthe CIP-
I1TMNCCB implementationmodality is supported further by aTMA institutionalandcapacity
assessments made inthe thirdpartyevaluation and inan updated(August 2003) assessment of
selectedTMAs. These institutional and capacity assessments were a "reality-check" andprovidedthe
inputfor the preparation ofthe CIP-I1TMNCCB capacity buildingprogram. The update showed
again that there are many weaknesses and hurdles to overcome, to make sure that CIP-I1can deliver
efficiently and effectively. The following salient findingsare flagged and need to be addressedto
ensure the expected economic benefitsfrom CIP-11:

0   District bodies still turnout to be the custodians o fprovincial interest rather than local bodies,

    bureaucracy and political leadership i s still going on, and does not contribute-at any level - to
    and consequently local bodies suffered. This political struggle and the strugglebetween the

    implementation effectiveness.

    ..
0   According to the NWFP TMA Rules of Business (2001) there i s aTown Municipal
    administrationthat i s a corporate body, responsible for
        Spatial and landuse control; buildingcontrol and coordinationof development plans and
        projects with different agencies
        Development of services; water, sanitation, solid waste, roads, streets, street lights,
        graveyards, fire fighting, traffic engineering, parks and open spaces; ina town of the
    ..  City/District / TMA except those functions which for technical or other reasons are retained
        bythe City/District / TMA Government
        Planningcapital investments, operation and maintenance of municipal services
        Providing staff and a mainomission inmany TMAs i s the TO (Planning) and staff capable to
        carry out CDE work - and the skills levels of these staff, the logistics, and other support
        facilities ineachTehsil/TMA are inadequate to meet all the tasks. The inadequacy of staff
        and resources is also due to the fact that DistrictlTMA Governments handedover the
    .   designated tasks and duties, butretainedmany resourcesthat are neededto carry out these
        tasks, andTMAs have a limitedscope to increasetheir resource/tax base.
        To solve the financial constraint, on many occasions TMAs are unable to pay staff or unable
    .   to pay for utilities, accumulatingarrears inpower bills.To meet "outside" counterpart
         contributions will be a major challenge for the TMAs.
        Creation of CCBs and not all inexistence or fully operational. InAugust 2003 there were 325
        CCBs registered. This number shouldbe compared with the total o f 990 UCs and the fact that
         some UCs have more than one CCB, and the number o f 325 covers less than 325 UCs.

ConclusionEconomic Analysis: The CIP-I1implementation modality, with TMAs as implementing
agencies, requires buildingo f the TMA administrative, technical and community development
capacity and improvement o fTMA staff skills. This capacity buildingcontributes systemically to the
broader devolution and poverty reductionobjectives o f the Government. Followingeffective capacity
buildingofTMAs, the CIP-I1schemes will have economic benefitsand Ems, and a cost-
effectiveness that i s at least the same as the CIP-I schemes.
     .   (transaction) cost and output standards of the portfolio of CIP-I1schemes under the new
         implementationmodality are the same as under CIP-I. The TMA capacity-building program
         i s to ensure the capability of the TMA to deliver on time, a similar menu and quality of output



                                                     96

       and services. The CIP-I selection criteria (improved) and similar ratios of primary/secondary
       works, threshold values for HHand other stakeholderscontributions, will be adheredto for
       CIP-I1 schemes constructed through the TMA. The CIP-I1portfolio and the schemes are
       therefore expected to be ofthe same nature as achieved under CIP-I.
       economic benefits are expectedto be inthe same range as benefits realized under CIP-I, but
            sensitive to, rather dependon, two main factors;
            the technical ability o fthe TMA to implement and deliver intime the same design,
            costing, quality and performance standardsas the CIP-I schemes, with the understanding
            that the TMA's technical ability covers the hardware/infrastructedesign and
            engineering, skills AND the social-engineering and community mobilization, requiredto
            complete a sustainable community-identified and community-owned scheme, and
            the actual fiscal space and commitment at TMNCCB level to make the requiredTMA
            10%counterpart contribution ofthe secondary works investments, andthe commitment
            o fthe provincial government to meet the 30% counterpart contribution o f the primary
            works investments and their share inthe overhead costs of the program. The financial
   .        section assessesthe counterpart resourcesrequiredand the resource base of the
            GoNWFP.
       Impact, effects and outcome o f the schemes will be similar to CIP-I, however under CIP-I1
       systemic improvements are expected, i.e. inrules, incentives, planning and monitoring
       capabilities and govemance that systematically includes the communities, are longterm and
       wide-spread. Infirst instance CIP-I1aims to buildcapacity and guide the TMAs and CCB to
       implement low-cost infrastructure for low-income groups. The expected demonstration
       effects will be long term and CIP-I1will permeate District / TMA and provincial planning
       anda positive impact onthe Government's PovertyAlleviation strategy is also expected. Part
       o f the TMNCCB capacity buildinginvestments should therefore be attributed to, and
       discounted against, these systemic improvements and longer term benefits.

 Financial Analysis

 Financial Analysis: The projectedCIP-I1portfolio is to cover about 586 CIP-I1schemes. A TMA
 capacity assessment (August 2003) and a financial/fiscal analysis show that sufficient commitment
 and fiscal space at TMNCCB and provincial level i s present to meet the requiredfinancial
 counterpart contributions by TMMCCBs. The financial analysis shows indetail that the required
 government budget and cash-flow is available:
 e       for sufficient financial contributions and timely release o f the GoNWFP provincial
         counterpart funds for primary works (30% primary works);
 e       for an adequateprovincial contribution to the overhead costs o f CIP-11;
 0       for timelytransfers to enable the TMA to make the required counterpart funds for secondary
         works (10% secondary works); and
 0       for capacity-buildingof CCB and communitiesto ensure their contribution (20% of
         secondaryworks) and their appreciation for their O&M responsibilities (3% secondary
         works).

Capacity of Province, TMAsand CCBs: CIP-I1projects a portfolio of 586 schemes. The required
government budget and cash-flow requirements and effective financial implementation of the CIP-I1
project depends on:
a. The formal status and capacity ofthe TMAs andtheir willingness to take on the CIP-I1
    infrastructure and community development targets, i.e. CIP-I1and TMA sharing the same values.
b. The speed at which the CIP-I1TMNCCB-capacity buildingprograms can be implemented and
    absorbedby eachTMNCCB, with the aim ofbuildingsufficient capacity inthe TMAs/CCBs to
    commence with CIP-I1scheme identificationand implementation.This changeprocess aims at
    improvement instaffing, skills, structure, systems (procurement, payment, accounts, audit,
    technical engineering), the formulation of a common strategy, e.g. the CIP-IUTehsil Municipal
    Services Delivery Plan, andeven the emergenceof a (TMA) leadership style, that promotes PPP,
    and community identifieddevelopment priorities and initiatives.

C.  The provincial fiscal space and its commitment to ensurethat sufficient allocation and timely
    release ofthe GoNWFP counterpart funds is made for the primary works (30% of value primary
    works) and the provincial share inCIP-I1overhead expenditures,
d. The fiscal space at Tehsil/UC levelsto allocate andmake available intime, the required
    counterpart fbnds of the secondaryworks (10% of value of secondary works),
e.  The readinessandresourcebase ofthe CCBs to-be-mobilized, to contribute their share (20% of
    the value ofthe secondaryworks) andto contribute to the O&M requirement (3% ofvalue of
    secondary works).
Points (a) and (b) will be addressedinthe project design chapters. Points (c), (d), and (e) are assessed
inthis section.

CIP-II Counterpart Financial Requirements : On the basis o f a projectedportfolio of 586 schemes to
be implemented inthe 61 TMAs of NWFP, and usingthe same financial contribution ratios of CIP-I
and taking a 05 year CIP-I1 implementation period, the CIP-I1 financial counterpart contributions
were calculated. The table below shows that:

0   at Provincial Government level around Rs 570 million i s required (excluding a lo%,        physical
    contingency allocation) which averages to a Rs 115 million annual contribution to the CIP-I1
    program. The GoNWFP is investigatingcollaborationwith, and co-financing from Grant donors.

0   at TMA level an average implementationof 9.6 schemes per TMA is projected, with average
    cost per each scheme set at Rs4.23 million (primary and secondary works). Based on these
    projections eachTMA i s requiredto contribute (10% of the secondary work) totaling Rs 2.68
    million. This contribution is to be available over a calendar implementationperiod of 03 years,
    andrequires a TMA annual budget contribution o f about Rs 900.000. It i s being investigated to
    what extent the TMA can activate a "buy-in" with funds from the UCs directly benefitingfrom
    the intendedCIP-I1scheme. Inthat case the 0 - 1 1counterpart fundrequirement burdenon the
    TMAbudgetcouldbereduced.TheUC's understandingofthe leverage effect, with a 10%
    investment amount generating a 10 times bigger total infrastructure investment inthe community,
    shouldbe communicated and promoted effectively.

0   At CBB or community level aper HHcontribution ofRs 2.837 is projectedanda contributionof
    3% of value of works for the O&M fund. These contributionshave been collectedeffectively in
    the past and this dependsto a large extent on the quality of the community mobilization skills of
    the TMA. Given the benefits expected to the community and the perceptions o f a properly
    sensitized community, through awarenesscampaigns, it is expected that the communitieswill
    continue allocate sufficient priority to their CIP-I1 scheme and will be able to generateresource to
    meet the required counterpart contribution.

0   Inadditionto the requiredbudgetallocations andtheir timely release,there is arequirement for
    sufficient working capital, to make sure capacity-building of the TMA, mobilization o f the CCB    -
    and communities, and implementationof the infkastructure schemes, can be given sufficient start-
    upmomentum. Cashavailability to maintainthe momentum dependson the speedwith which
    SoE arereimbursed.

Fiscal SpaceFormulas: Fiscal space and development funds available at T M M C levels to provide
the CIP-I1 counterpart funds at the ratios agreedbetween the GoNWFP and the donor, are determined
by the LGO andProvincialFinance Commissionaward (2002/03). The financial analysis presents (i)
2003/04 budget allocations as per LGO and PFC, and (ii)summary assessment of the past years
                                                              a
provincial government financial performance, and an assessment o fthe financial health of the TMAs
andtheir investment priorities.


NWFP Provincial Financial Policy: The local government layers createdby LGO (2001) have been
allocated their respective tasks and resources. The Provincial Government itself concludes that there
are "problems relatedto the devolution process, especially departmental monitoring of reforms and
lack o f clarity inroles and responsibilities o f the provincial and District / TMA governments". The
system is still beingfinalized, not inthe least because the distribution o fpowers andresponsibilities
over the various layers o f local government and its relation to the provincial government, will be the
outcome o fa political negotiationprocessthat i s still ongoing. The responsibilitieso f the TMAs
match the objectives o f the CIP-I1project and the TMAs are to enter into an agreementwith the CCB
and with the CIP-I1PMU. With regard to the financial resourcesto be allocated or available to the
TMAs the ProvincialFinance Commission(PFC) notified on 16June 2003 its Award for 2003/04 as
follows:
    from the provincialpool of revenue first the provincial obligatory expenditure will be met, and
    from the balance, or divisiblepool, 60% is the Provincial Allocable Amount (transferred to
    District / TMAs) and 40% i s the ProvincialRetained Amount, inaddition the 2.5% GST received
    from the Federal government will be transferred to the Local Governments entirely.
    Zila historical shares of eachDistrictrlMA will be transferred to the Union Councils after
    deducting 1O%District/TMA council share, and Octroi historical shares shall be transferred to
    Tehsils after deducting 1O%District/TMA councils share, and a special Octroi/Zila grant (from
    2.5% GST) i s made for those (18) Tehsils that were not collecting Octroi/Zilla at time o f
    abolition, to meet recurring/development expenditures.
    to cater to recurring and development expenditures o fDistrict/TMAs, Tehsils and UCs, the
    remainder o f 2.5% GST and 90% of Provincial Allocable Amount (Non-salary), is to be
    transferred to local governments, on basis of three factors with the following weights; 50% on the
    basis o fpopulation, 25% on basis ofbackwardness and 25% on basis of Lag in
    infrastructure. 10% shall be transferred as fiscal equalizationgrant for the purpose o f resource
    redistribution, deficit bridging.The Provincial Allocable salary portion o f the District / TMA
    Government Budgets i s not distributedaccording to the formula.
     10% o fnon-salary will be retainedby the PFC to cover 50% deficit o f District / TMAs
    governments and other unforeseen expenditures on the basis o fneed.

    o out ofthebalance funds share for CCBs will be earmarked. For CCBs not yet in
         existence/operational the share so arrived will be carried forward to the nextyear.
    o the balance District / TMA development budget funds willbe sharedas follows:
    o 60% to the District / TMA, andthe District / TMAs will allocate these funds as follows: 30%
         to other sectors, and 70% for the social sectors, inturn a sub-allocation of the 70% for the
         social sectors is to be; 40% for Education, 35% for health, and 25% for other social sectors.

Fiscal Space 2003/04: Onthe basis of Budget Estimates sufficient counterpart budget seems to be
available at TMA levels, to meet Rs 900.000 annual contribution requirementto implementan
average o f 9.6 schemes per TMA. Inthe District / TMAs o fKohat and Hangu the Rs 900.000 CP-I1
counterpart allocation approaches 50% of the available development budget. If"buy-in" by UCs can
be activated a disproportionate use by CIP-I1of available Tehsil funds could be avoided. The ability
o f the TMA to contribute out of its developments funds the requiredCIP counterpart funds i s also
determinedby the current or non-development budgetfunds available.

NWP Financial Provincial Performance and TMAAssessment: The pastperformance ofthe
province needs to be taken into account when assessing the budget estimates for 2003104 and the
following facts are considered:
     PFCand Financial Management: There is a degree of uncertainty and inthe provincial financial
     policy and allocations. The Provincial Finance Commission (PFC) notification mentions that "the
     PFC hadno detail o f District / TMA resource and expenditure requirements and therefore the
     award isrecommended for one year". It has beenpractice to make considerable cuts and
     reductions inthe development budget, when shortfall or deficit situations occur. These cuts
     happen when transfers from federal level to province, and subsequently from province to District
     / TMAhehsil levels are lower than originally budgeted. The weight of the current budget and the
     imbalance between current and development, with the share o f development budget inthe total
     budget varying from 10%to 5%, indicates the scarcity of development funds.
     Provincial Non-development: The 2002103 non-development budgethadrevenues estimated at Rs
     46.7 billion, while the revisedestimates for that year show revenues of Rs 37 billion, or a
     shortfall o f about Rs 10billion. This i s explained by the shortfall inthe net HydelProfits, which
     were estimated at Rs 15.9 billion, butwhich tumedout to be Rs 6 billion, which i s the "fixed"
     amount the province has beenreceiving from the Federal Govemment inthe past years. Despite
     this massive shortfallthe ProvincialGovemmentmanagedto have a surplus on its non-
     development budget, by reducingexpenditures. As part o f a rationalization process the provincial
     Government embarked on a three year Provincial Reforms Program, that will increasethe
     reliability and predictability of the budget and expenditure figures. However, for the year 2003/04
     the expectedNetHydelProfitshavebeenestimated at Rs 17.7 billion. Itis most unlikelythat the
     provincial government will receive this amount. Ifthe usual Rs 6 billion is receiveda shortfall of
     11billion can be expected and expenditure cuts o f the same magnitude can be expected in
     2003104. Giventhe commitment received from the provincial leadership while negotiating CP-11,
     it seems the requiredprovincial allocationfor CIP-Ii will bemade available. Co-financing from a
     grant donor will make it more likely that the requiredprovincial counterpart funds will available.
     Districts Development Budgets: The Provincial Government reduced its DevelopmentBudget
     2002/03 from Rs 13.7 billion to a revisedestimate o f Rs 11.6 billion. The share out o f this
     development budget to betransferred to District / TMA Governments was safeguarded, with a Rs
     963 million 2002103 revisedestimate and the same amount i s budgeted for 2003/04
     TMABudgets: It seems possible for TMAs to provide counterpart funds. The situation on ground
     however i s different. Inmany TMAs the TO (Planning) and staff capable to carry out CD works
     are not inplace, and the skills levels o f these staff and logistics and other support facilities in
     TehsilsITMAs are inadequate to meet all the tasks, let alone to take on effectively the added
     responsibility CIP-I1requires. Capacity-building at TMA level i s essential. The inadequacy o f
     staff and resources is due to the fact that ProvincialDistrict Governments handed over the LGO
     designated tasks and duties to TMAs, butretainedmany resources neededto carry out these tasks.
     TMAs are facing a financial constraint, and are onmany occasions unable to pay its staff on time,
     or unable to pay for utilities, accumulatingarrears inpower bills.TMAs have a limitedscope to
     increasetheir tax/ resource base, limitedby District or Province authorities. Provincial /district


                                                      106

     transfers have often considerable deductions at source to recover outstanding utilitiesbills. To
     meet the CIP-I1counterpart contribution will be a challenge for the TMAs.
CIP-11Equity concerns: CIP-11may consider the use ofthe NWFP "Backwardness" and "Lag in
Infrastructure" weights as a guideto ensure equitable distribution of the CIP-I1investment over the 24
District and 61 TMAs of the NWFP province. CIP-I1may want to avoid an end-of-project-result
where the better equipped andbetter endowed TMAs of the richer Districts have been able to meet
more easily the CIP-I1entry requirements and selection criteria, and were able to process and absorb
proportionally more of the available CIP-I1investments, thanthe more backwardand deserving areas
and communitiesinNWFP. Backwardness and lag ininfrastructure indicatorsor a combination may
serve as a guide to direct the CIP-I1infrastructure. It should benoted that inthe rankingand weights
applied by the GoNWFP, the poorer DistrictdTMAs get a highpriority when ranked on
backwardness, but when rankedon Lag ininfrastructure a highpriority is given to populated
Districts/ TMAs with bigger cities andtowns, like Peshawar,Mardan, and Abottabad.

Conclusion Financial Analysis: On the basis of NWFP Provincial Finance Award and the Budget
Estimates 2003/04, sufficient counterpart budget allocations and commitment for timely releases,
seems to be available at Provincial and at TMA levels. At TMA level an annual contribution o f about
Rs900,000 for 03 years isrequiredto implement an averageof 9.6 schemes perTMA. The ability of
the TMA to contribute out ofits development funds the requiredCIP counterpart funds also takes into
account the availability of current or non-development budget funds. The TMAs' willingness was
assessed in a consultative workshop late 2003 and most TMAs indicated their commitment and
willingness to contribute. The following is to be considered:

     0   Identification of grant donors for the CIP-I1TMA and CBB capacity-building activities, to
         ease the financial burdenon the GoNWFP

     0   with regard to fiscal space at TMA/UC levels there is on the basis of the officialbudget
         estimates sufficient space for the TMAs to meet their counterpart contributions, especially if
         a U C buy-incan pursuedby the TMAs.

EnvironmentalManagement FrameworkThe EnvironmentalManagement Framework (EMF)for
CIP-I1has been prepared, including a capacity buildingplan for EMF, withan objective of
minimizingpossible adverse impact on environmental and incorporating environmentaldimension
into C I sub projects through the development of an Environmental Management Framework (EMF).
The purpose o f the EMFi s to improve decision making and to ensure that the project options under
consideration are environmentally sound and sustainable. Environmental Assessment (EA) i s akey
component o f EMFand is expectedto inform the decision makers on the nature of environmental
risks. For the CIP-I1the principal objectives of EMF are to:

    0    Enhance the design of community infrastructure plans and sub-projects; and


    0 Ensure sub-project compliance with environmental safeguards through environmental checklist
         (see Appendix VIII: Social andEnvironment Assessment & Management Guidelines).

ImplementationArrangement for EMF

The CIP-I1will beexecutedat four differentlevels: I) ProgramSupport and Coordination Unit
                                                         A
(PSCU), ii)Regional Support and CoordinationTeam (RSCT) iii)TMA level for Community
Infrastructure Sub Project implementation, and iv) CCB and Community level for implementation of
basic infiastructure and services and O&M. Basedon this, the followinginstitutional arrangements
are proposed for the implementationo f EMP at different levels further reinforced with external
environmentalmonitoringandbackstoppingby EPA:
    .    PolicyandProgramManagementLevel: The ProgramReviewBoard(PRB), willbe
         established to deal with policy matters o f the CIP-I1program to be chairedby the Additional
         Chief SecretaryNWFP wouldbe the highest body ofthe Project. Inorder to ensure that EMF

    .    i s fully integrated into project implementationmechanism, the Director General of the NWFP
         EnvironmentalProtectionAgency would be made a member of PRB.

         ImplementationLevel: Comprehensive capacity buildingandprofessionaltrainingprogram
         would be developed to enable the field staff and CCBs to implement the EMP. Required
         environmentalguidelines to be usedby the field staff and communities for assessment,
         monitoring, andmitigation have also beendeveloped and provided as part of this EMP.

         Community Level: Environmental education andcapacity buildingofthe community would
    .    be a built-incomponent o f the community development activity.

         SchemeLevel:all schemeshaveto undergoEnvironmental appraisal before approvaland
    .    funding.

         ExternalMonitoringandBackstopping: The EPA canbe askedto carry out periodic
         environmentalmonitoring (6 monthly) beside assisting inenvironmentalassessment and
         capacity building.




                                                    109

EnvironmentalManual and ResourceKitwill be developed for use byproject staff. The
environmental screening and mitigation guidelines and checklists already provided inthe EMFwill
be refined andexpanded and includedinthe EnvironmentManual and Resource Kit for use by
project staff.
The NWFPEnvironmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) will continue to act as a service provider during
preparation and implementationof the project to;
             carry out the 6-monthly monitoring
             assistthe project to design the environmental training programs and prepare training
             materials
             assist the project inthe health, environment and sanitation awareness component
             (HESA).
Linkages o f CIP-I1will be developed with other Departments and NWFPand internationalagencies
such as IUCNto enhance environmentalbenefits of the project, as described inthe EMF.

EnvironmentalManagementthroughCommunityInstitutionalstrengthening:

    TMA Environmentalscreening capacity: Developandimplementcapacity buildingon
    environmentalscreening methodology at TMA level for the tehsil to gradually adopt anduse a
    simple checklist/format andthen go for more comprehensive screening that will ultimately
    include cheap and simple to use mobile laboratory checks on quality o f drinkingwater,
    contaminationlevels etc. EPA and IUCN couldprovide the methodology, formats, procedures for
    transfer o f skills andbetter understanding.

    EnvironmentalManagement at CCBlevel. Itwas observedthat communities are appraised
    and obtain some level of environmentalawareness, as a result o f the CIP intervention. What i s
    required is for a CCB to learnto assess the consequencesofthe scheme and to learnhow to
    follow-through and communicate andnegotiate ina constructive manner with the TMA, and how
    to address problems that arise from drain water and waste disposal etc.

    Enhanceenvironmentalawarenessandsensitizationat communitylevel: Environmental
    aspects and concern wouldbe incorporatedinto all community development programs as an
    integral component o f community mobilization and training to enhance community awareness
    and sensitization.

Social Safeguards
Social assessment:A social assessment o f all sites will be undertaken as a pre requisite for sub
project implementation. The programwill ensure compliance with all social safeguards, particularly,
Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12, Indigenous People: OD 4.20 and Cultural Property OP 4.11:


Safeguardissues:Issues emergingfromthe Portfolioreview andRapidAssessment are;

1. Project interventionrequires provisionoffree landor voluntary donation. The landprovidedis
    usually shamilat (community owned) or landdonated by an individual onbehalf o f the
    community. The CIP-I didnot go into the details of how the land was acquiredby the community
    for voluntary donation. According to TPV, inone case there was an issue o f land ownership in
    solid waste management sub project. There i s thus an absence o frecords to substantiate the
    process followed.



                                                    110

2. Records o f land transfer need to bekept at all offices. Although landhas beennotarizedand
    transferred for water supply projects, recordsneedto be maintainedproperly.

3.  Consultations and documentation of all consultations are an important aspect o fthe safeguard
    policy. Although consultations were reportedlyheldby CIP I,      but documentation of the
    consultations need to be maintained. As aresult, it is not possible to verify that there was
    consensus, and for cases of adverseimpact on livelihood that he/she was consulted and
    alternative mitigatory measuresprovided.

4. CIP Ididnot provide for adequate grievance redressalmechanism to account for adverse social
    impacts. The focus was on the traditional Jirga systemthat is generally acceptable and usedto
    resolve issues. However, the processfor recording andresolving issues on land and other social
    issuesneeds to be inplace. Ifthe Jirga i s to be used, a follow up mechanismneeds to be inplace
    to ensure that the issues are raised and addressedaccordingly.

The project will ensurethat consultations areheld anddocumented for all safeguards issues and a
grievance redressal mechanism is inplace for safeguard.

InvoluntaryResettlement OP4.12: Theproject envisagesonly donated landthat is small innature
and there will be no involuntary land acquisition. For the roads component althoughpresently not
envisaged, but shouldinvoluntary landacquisitionbe required, the project will ensure that the Land
Acquisition Act 1894is followed and a Resettlement Policy Framework (along with an entitlement
framework) evolved inkeepingwith OP 4.12 and cleared by IDA.

For land donatedby the community the project will ensure:

             The voluntary nature ofthe land and get it documented from the person(s) donating the
             land;
             That the land is identified by the community and confirmed by the technical staff of the
             relevant TMA (reviewed by CIP I1duringappraisal o f the scheme);
             That the land i s free of squatters, encroachersor other encumbrances/claims;
             That for loss o f livelihoods of vulnerable persons or physical displacement, verification
             o f voluntary acceptance of community devised mitigatory measuresis obtained from
             those vulnerable persons adversely affected;
             That community devised mitigatory measuresfor those vulnerable persons losing
             livelihood would consist ofprovision of alternative means o f livelihood through location
             at a site that would ensure the ability to earn same level o f income. Another alternative
             may be provision of income through provision o f some form o f employmentby the
             community to enable the individual to maintain the same level of income;
             That for community services provided under the project, land title will be vested inthe
             TMA, through anotarizedIqranama and also appropriate guarantees ofpublic access to
             services are givenby private titleholders (or government) who owned the land;
That a grievance redressal mechanism will be inplace. The OperationalManual details the process
and mechanism for its implementation.

0   IndigenousPeople: OD4.20: There areno knownIndigenouspeople inthe province except the
    Kalashtribe located in3 three valleys of Chitral ( Bamburet, Birir and Rumbar). Ifany site i s
    selectedthat i s locatedinthese areas the project will ensure compliance with OD 4.20.The
    Processwill be laidout inthe Operational Manual and EMP.

TehsilLevelPerformance Management System

The development of a performance-oriented culture (inhumanresource development andtehsil
performance) will be establishedbasedon analysis by and the experience of the Institutional Support
Program(ISP) component of CIP 1. . Simple indicators and benchmarks relatedto financial
performance, humanresource management and service deliveryperformance (e.g. coverage, quality,
poverty targeting), will be agreed through a series of facilitatedworkshops. Indicators will also be
reflective o f the PRSP targets and the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Incentiveswill be established
for community basedmonitoring and social audits, such as annual `citizen report cards' on service
delivery.

TheM&E/MIS Unitat thePCSUincoordinationwiththe RCSTs will assistthe TMAs indefining
and buildingthe necessary capacity for establishing and maintaining performance based systems.
Thiswill include areview ofthe current MISand IT situationat the Tehsil level (basedonthe
institutional assessmentsundertakenby the ISP). EachTMA will develop arealistic and sequenced
TehsilPerformance ImprovementPlanbasedon the analysis.

ProjectMonitoring:

The routine monitoring systemwill focus onproject implementationandperformance (results), and
will emphasize the key intermediate indicators, which will leadto project outcomes as definedby the
Project Design Summary and Key Performance Indicators. To establish the basis o f leaming, it will
also incorporate key ProcessIndicators at all these tiers. Basic process indicators have been defined
inthe Operational Manual. Thesewillbefurther discussedwithbeneficiariesandrefinedthrough
workshops at the start o f the Project. A series of workshops shouldbe undertaken, between the
PCSU and RCSTs at first, and then with TMAs and incrementally with participatingUnionCouncils
and CCBs.

Project monitoring will take place at all tiers: community/CCB, Union Council, TMA, RCST, PCSU,
PRB, GoNWFP (e.g. monitoring committee o f P&DD),~andthrough the Bank's routine monitoring.
While the Union Council has no implementationrole, its monitoringrole as defined inthe LGO will
be developed. This will buildthe skills and ownership of the Councilors andpromote a more in-
depth understandingof the Project's objectives and processes.

A monitoringplanwill be established for each sub-project, and will includeprogress andprocess
indicators (including monitoring o f environmentalandsocial safeguards and financial monitoring).

The PCSUwith the respective RCSTs will conduct a needs analysis to determine capacity building
needs, and define a training program inM&Eand ProcessMonitoring, including the establishment of
effective information flows, at all these levels.

Process Learning, Evaluation and Communication:

To avoid the gap between routine monitoring, and leaming and evaluation, it was agreed that there
should be an emphasis on generating sufficient and quality information for institutional leaming and
measuring outcomes and impact. A workshop at the start of the Project will identifykey areas for


                                                    113

learningand evaluation, which will then berevisited annually. Learning and Evaluationwill be based
on the following tools.

Baseline and Longitudinal Surveys: A baseline survey will be undertakeninYear 1andwill be
conducted by an independent researchinstitution or firm. It will buildon existinginformation
systems (e.g. PIHS, CWIQ, Multi-Indicator Cluster Survey). While designing the Baseline,
consideration will be givento expectedoutcomes and the information needs for measuring these. The
baseline survey will initiallybe usedto assess Project progress, but over the longer term will form
part o f a Tehsil information systemon poverty targeting and reform.

Considerationwill be given to developing longitudinal or panel data sets for a sample o fhouseholds,
to assess the Project's impact on household welfare.

Beneficiary Assessments: Beneficiary Assessmentswill be undertaken twice; at the Mid-Term
Review and prior to Project closure. The Assessmentswill be carried out by a research institute or
consulting firm. The Assessments will assess stakeholder perceptions on Project implementation and
performance. A representative sample of schemes will be selected for assessment.

Special Studies: Special studies (such as citizen satisfaction surveys, KAP surveys or the analysis of
institutionalbottlenecks identified throughProcessMonitoring) will be undertaken as needed. These
couldbe undertaken by project staff, support organizations, or by research organizations/ consulting
firms depending on the scale and level of analysis required.

Special studies will informthe Mid-TermReview, and an independent evaluation study (managedby
the Bank) shouldbe conductedatProject closure.

ProcessLearning: Process Monitoring is a flexible andresponsive management tool, which has
helpedorganizations to transform to become more participatory, transparent and demand-responsive,
through a process o fjoint learning and problem-solving. It is particularly important in `process
driven' projectsandprograms. Itnot only allows corrective measuresto betaken ina timelymanner,
but also empowers communitiesandother stakeholders through open flows ofinformationand
participationindecision-making. Itcomplements the Project's M&Eand MIS systems, by analyzing
the `quality' and effectiveness ofproject processesandidentifyingpossible alternatives.

Process Learning will be critical to the Project, andwill be basedon information generatedthrough
Process Monitoringat all levels, and through Special Studies. The challenges to the newly
decentralized governments are enormous. New actors and new relationships have been introduced,
and there are documented vacuums incapacity. While providing opportunities for responsive service
delivery, accountability, political participation and poverty reduction- there are challenges interms of
elite capture, financial sustainability and capacity to deliver to citizens. Similarly, CCB formation
and functioning has been characterized by a number of issues, which undetected could also result in
non-participatory and elite organizations. ProcessLearning will form the basis of accountability. It
will also provide a timely assessment o fProject rules and procedures, to ensure that key outcomes are
met.

The ProcessLearningteam at the PCSU will design and buildcapacity for ProcessMonitoringat the
various levels, and will commission and conduct Special Studies as required. Based on the learning
from CIP 1, the Process Learning unit shouldbe `internal' to the Project, but with external lines o f
reporting. The team will therefore report directly to the Director General, but will also be mandated
to report directly to the Bank and to the MonitoringCommittee inP&DD.



                                                   114

CommunicatiodDissemination: Open flows of information will be critical for transparency. They
will also be important inpromotinganunderstandingof andbuy-into the principles and objectives of
the Project for sustainability. The Communications Team will be basedinthe PCSU, working
closely with the ProcessLeamingandEvaluationTeam to disseminate key learning. A
Communication Strategy will be developed for the Project, and information and learning will be
disseminatedbothinternally and externally. The strategy will be targeted to different segments of the
audience, from CCBs to senior policy makers. A Projectwebsite will be establishedmaintained, and
innovative methods such as e-newsletters will also be used. Informationon TMA performance
shouldbe maintainedthroughthe website. The strategy will buildon the best use o f the electronic
and printmedia, and also include the promotion o fnetworks. For example, radio chat-shows or
television documentaries will be usedto promote the Project and encourage sharing o f experience.

MonitoringandInformationFlows

This section defines the M&Erequirements andinformation flows at the different levels of
implementation.


CCB

The General Secretary o f the CCB will prepare quarterlyreports, gathering information from sub-
committees on Physical Implementation, Women's Development, Social andEnvironmental
Safeguardsand O&M. The President or Chairperson of the CCB will then report through the Union
Council to the TMA MonitoringCommittee, with a copy o f the report being submittedto the RCST.

Reportingwill cover physical implementation, procurement and financial issues, social and
environmental safeguards, social/participation issues, gender, capacity buildingandTMA
performance.

A Sub-Project MonitoringPlanwill be developedpriorto final approval ofthe scheme.

UnionCouncil

A MonitoringCommittee (at the CouncilLevelto be formed), will report onprogress, processand
quality issuesrelatedto Trunk Infrastructure, Community Works, O&M and the effectiveness of the
CCB. The reports will be submittedto the TMA through the Naib-Nazim, with copy to the RCST.


TMAs

TMAs will prepareintemalperformance andprogress reports for their MonitoringCommittee, which
will be copiedto the RCST monthly. Financialreports (SOEs), will be submittedto the PCSU. TMA
reports shouldbe publicly available at the TMA level, and also at the Union Council and CCB levels.

Intemalreporting on performance will focus on areas such as financial managementhesource
mobilization, planninglcommunity Development, Human Resource Development.

Extemalreporting, inparticular for the CCBs, should focus on areas such as procurement (contracts
issued), physicalprogress onprimary works, financial issues, responsesto citizen complaints (actions
taken), CCB performance, capacity building.




                                                  115

RCST

The RCST will be responsible for filtering and collating information. It will form the first level o f
analysis. Monthlyreports basedon the consolidated information, will be submittedto the PCSU
M&EandProcessLearningteams, onCommunityDevelopment, Physicalprogress, HumanResource
Development, and financial flows. Summary reports will be submitted to CCBs and TMAs, possibly
through a monthly newsletter. The RCST will also report on PCSUresponsiveness and performance
intheir ProgressReports.

The RCST should identifythe need for special studies or small case studies, and work with the PCSU
Monitoringand Process Learning teams inmanaging or conductingthese.
PCSU

The PCSU i s responsible for consolidating Project wide information and reporting to the GoNWFP
and the Bank. Itwill beresponsible for Quarterly and Annual ProgressReports and any other donor
reportingrequirements. Monthly reports will be submitted to the GoNWFP. The PCSU will report
on RCST progress, policy issues, resource mobilization, recruitment andpersonnel management,
humanresource development, capacity building, and feedback from special studies, beneficiary
assessments etc.

The Process Learning team at the PCSU level will coordinate the RCSTs and community and TMA
efforts inlearningandimprovingprocesses. They will work with these levels to identify areas for
special studies, andwill work with them inanalyzing and presenting process data.


IDA/Bankand GoNWFP

The Bankwill conduct routine Supervision/ Review Missions, andwilljointly be responsible for the
Mid-Term Review and ICR. The GoNWFP will monitor the Project based on monthly Project
reports.
