REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE FOR A
SECOND SINGAPORE EDUCATION PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Singapore for the equivalent of US$19.5 million to help finance
a Second Singapore Education Project.   The loan would have a term of
20 years including a grace period of six years with interest at 7-1/4 per-
cent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The last economic mission visited Singapore in April, 1973.   Its
report will be distributed to the Executive Directors shortly. The principal
conclusions are discussed below. Country data are included in Annex I.
3.        Singapore achieved self-government in 1959; in 1962 it became
a member of the Federation of Malaysia. Since then Singapore has en-
countered and overcome a series of political and economic difficulties.
These have included the confrontation with Indonesia between 1963 and 1965,
and Singapore's separation from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965. More-
over, with entrepot trade as a mainstay of its economy (contributing 17.4
percent of GDP in 1961) Singapore was exposed to the many vagaries of
international price fluctuations. Then, in the mid-1960's Singapore was
faced with severe unemployment, which was subsequently compounded by the
withdrawal of British forces which at that time provided some 50,000 jobs
to the econony and represented a sizeable contribution - some 17 percent -
to GDP.
4.        As a remedial measure, the Government adopted a policy aimed at
rapid development of the manufacturing sector, encouraging a labor-
intensive, export-oriented industry mix, while extending a welcoming hand
to foreign investment in the form of fiscal incentives, duty-free import
of capital goods and raw material requirements, as well as tariff protection,
on a selective basis and usually for a specified time period. A further
incentive to foreign investors was the growth and development of Singapore's
financial sector. Moreover, changes in labor legislation adopted in 1968
guaranteed the private investor a high degree of wage stability and
minimized the possibility of labor unrest.
5.        The success of this policy has been evident in the rapid growth
of Singapore's economy since the mid-sixties. Between 1966 and 1970
overall GDP grew at an average annual rate of some 13 percent in real
terms. The manufacturing sector, the major source of growth, averaged
some 23 percent annual real growth between 1966 and 1970, thus increasing
its contribution to GDP from 14.5 percent in 1966 to 20.2 percent in 1970.
Direct foreign investment has played the leading role in this remarkable
growth, reflecting a high degree of international confidence in Singapore's
growth potential. Growth in exports of domestic products, which averaged
18 percent annually between 1966 and 1970, has also been impressive.
Other noteworthy sectors have been constructian and tourism whose annual



-2-
growtn rates between 1966 and 1970 were 26 and 32 percent respectively.
A further measure of the Government's success has been the continuing
reduction iLn the economy's reliance on entrepot trade.  Although entrepot
trade still figures largely in total trade (some 40 percent in 1971),
is contribution to GDP has declined from 17.4 percent to 10.5 percent in
the period 1961-1971.
6.        However, the Government's policy has not been without problems.
What had been a labor surplus economy (the official unemployment rate in
1965 was 8.7 percent) has been transformed into one which now faces spot
labor shortages and indeed this is one of the most critical problems
which must be solved if Singapore's recent economic performance is to be
mainitained.  The Government is well aware of this problem and has prudently
adopted a number of measures which should mitigate this difficulty. With
regard to the lower skill levels, the granting of work permits to immigrant
(mostly Malaysian) labor has been liberalized. Estimates of the number
of such laborers, who are largely concentrated in the construction industry,
currently range anywhere from 60,000 to 100,000, or 8-13 percent of the
domestic labor force. Moreover, female participation in the labor force
is being encouraged and the adoption of more mechanized production techniques,
particularly in the construction industry, is increasing.
7.        The Government's cognizance of the economy's manpower constraint
is reflected in its increasing selectivity in the types of new industries
coming into Singapore. Henceforth, only those industries wlhich can guarantee
a deepening of the industrial structure beyond the simple assembly-type
operations, which have predominated in the past, will be encouraged. This
will imply a general upgrading of skill levels required throughout the
economy with consequent increases in labor productivity. The Government has
continually stressed that Singapore's long-term future lies in her human
resources and current policies aimed at the development of a highly skilled
and sophisticated workforce are consistent with this obiective.
8.        While the sixties presented a decade of phenomenal growth, during
the last two years the economy showed some signs of slowing down. Between
1971-1972, GDP registered an average of 13 percent growth in current prices
as compared with an average of 15 percent between 1967 and 1970. Moreover,
while precise data on price trends do not exist, inflation is known to have
increased markedly in the last two years. In 1972, inflation was estimated
at about 5 percent as compared with less than one percent per annum in
the late sixties; thus real growth in 1972 was probably less than 10 percent.
9.        The major factors in last year's "recession" were, firstly, the
greatly reduced deliveries of petroleum to Viet Nam; secondly, the decline
in British military spending; and thirdly, the uncertainty resulting from
two years' of international monetary crises which are thought to have
adversely affected the trade sector and the inflow of foreign investment.
10.       Public sector finance has been marked by sound management and
the vigorous savings efforts of the Government. In FY72/73 the current
account surplus was some US$119 million, and it is projected at US$214 mil-
lion in FY73/74. Growth in Government revenue has averaged some 11 percent



-3-
annually for the last five years, with increasing reliance on tax revenue,
and in particular, on direct taxes, thus making the tax system more
respDnsive to increases in income. Public sector investments in FY72/73
totalled US$399 million; in FY73/74 this is expected to rise to US$524
million. These investments are primarily undertaken by a group of well
run and financially sound statutory authorities which in FY72/73 accounted
for 73 percent of total public investment.
11.       The balance of payments continues to be strong.   Overall surpluses
have been realized every year since 1966; in 1972 the surplus amounted
to US$202 million. This has been possible despite a growing deficit in
recorded merchandise trade which has been more than compensated by surpluses
in the service account, long-term capital inflows and increases in net
errors and omissions in Singapore's favor. From 1971 to 1972, net foreign
exchange reserves increased by US$334 million to US$1.8 billion approximately
equal to six months' imports. Singapore is wise to maintain a comfortable
margin of resources in the light of its heavy reliance on international
trade: in 1972, the ratio of the value of external trade to GDP was over
200 percent. A closer analysis of the components of the balance of payments
is not possible due to the absence of information on the errors and
omissions item. In 1972 this entry amounted to over US$1 billion. Any
reallocation of this item would thus drastically affect estimates of the
current accounts balance and long-term capital inflows.
12.       The major problems which will confront the Government in the near
future appear to be the availability of labor, especially at the skJlled
and technical levels, and inflation, particularly imported inflation. The
latter is a growing source of concern since price and wage stability have
hitherto been the hallmarks of the Singapore economy and a major factor
in its ability to attract foreign investment. The Government is, however,
well aware of the labor and inflation problems and is taking steps to
remedy them as far as possible. Its proposals for ameliorating the labor
shortage have been discussed above. The problem of inflation is more
formidable. In recent efforts to absorb excess liquidity and thereby
prevent excessive overheating of the economy, the Government has twice
raised the minimum reserve liabilities commercial banks must hold with the
monetary authority. Then, in an attempt to control imported inflation, with-
out sacrificing the basic openness of the economy, the Singapore dollar
was allowed to float in international money markets, beginning in June, 1973.
It has since floated upward to US$1.00 = S$ 2.30, representing a revaluation
of some 10 percent.
13.       Official external borrowing requirements will be largely a function
of the size of long-term private capital inflows. The current outlook for
foreign investment is somewhat uncertain. Certain factors which in the
past have favored Singapore as a venue for foreign investment continue to
prevail, namely, stable politics, a good communications network, and a
minimum of red tape. However, inflation and the possibility of a growing
labor shortage could become serious deterrents to the future growth of
foreign investment. The magnitude of these problems and the Government's
ability to deal with them remain to be seen but, it is certain that a
marked deceleration in foreign investment would have serious repercussions



-4-
on the economy. In addition, investment in the oil refinery industry, which
has represented a major part of foreign investment in the past, is likely to
be minimal in the Lmmediate future due to excess installed capacity at the
present time.  Witlh the further development of the financial sector it is
likely that local capital will play an increasingly important role in the
expansion of existing industries. However, Singapore remains vulnerable
to external economic fluctuations, as evidenced by the economy's slowdown
during the past year. Given the nature of the economy, this situation will
necessarily prevaiL in the future.   This factor, along with the need for
sizeable investments in some kinds of urban infrastructure for which
external project financing may be difficult to secure, but which are
imperative to Singapore's future growth, justifies the continuation of
official project borrowing on a limited scale.
14.       Singapore's external public debt position shows US$437 milllion
outstanding (including undisbursed) as of December 31, 1972. About 26 per-
cent of this is due to the Bank, 22 percent to the Asian Development Bank,
and 19 percent to the UK Government; suppliers credits represent about
5 percent. The debt service burden arising from this debt was US$32.3
million in 1972, of which US$8.7 million was due to the Bank, or about
26 percent. The total debt service in 1972 represented about 2 percent
of Gross National Savings and 3 percent of domestic exports. By 1978
Singapore's outstanding external debt (including undisbursed) is expected
to reach to US$1,014 million and the annual debt service burden is projected
to reach US$119 million, or about 5.2 percent of domestic exports. Of
Singapore's projected total outstanding external debt in 1978, US$199 million
or 20 percent, will be due to the Bank, giving rise to a debt service burden
of some US$26 million, or 22 percent of Singapore's total debt service in
that year. Singapore is creditworthy for external borrowing on conventional
terms.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN SINGAPORE
15.       The proposed loan would be the Bank's thirteenth operation in
Singapore. The previous loans were for power, telecommunications, port
modernization and expansion, water supply and sewerage, education and,
through the Development Bank of Singapore, for industrial development. As
of November 30, 1973, the loans to Singapore held by the Bank amounted to
US$116.7 million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans as
of November 30, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
16.       The Bank lendiiig strategy aims essentially at providing financial
and technical support to institutions in the forefront of Singapore's
development process. Some of the institutions to which we have lent in
the past have now become administratively and technically mature and are
able to finance future expansion from their own resources or borrowings
from commercial sources abeoad.   Future Bank lending will therefore be
directed to projects in new and more difficult fields, such as mass
transit and pollution control and in key sectors, such as education,
which are essential to Singapore's further economic and social development



- 5 -
and for wlhich project finance will be more difficult to mobilize.   The Bank
is currently serving as the Executing Agency for a UNDP-financed project to
study Singapore's mass transit requirements, This study could, if its
results are satisfactory, lead to a series of Bank loans.
PART III - THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
17.       Singapore's education and training system has adapted well to
meet the requirements of structural change in the economy but further
development is required at the university level to generate the necessary
manpower to implement the country's social and economic policies. Enroll-
ment at the primary level is virtually 100 percent of children in the
relevant age group (6-11) and nearly two-thirds of the lower secondary
school age group (12-15). Beyond this, however, enrollments drop con-
siderably. Only 13 percent of the relevant age group is enrolled in upper
secondary schools (pre-university) and only 7 percent in post-secondary
institutions, the latter divided almost equally between universities and
technical colleges. Free of pressure to increase enrollment at the lower
levels, the Government's education policy aims at improving the quality
and practical relevance of secondary education; expanding its programs
of adult education, on-the-job training, and post-secondary technical
training; and further developing university education.
18.       The Government is attempting to improve the quality of general
education in a number of ways. Curricula and teaching methods are being
updated. General and technical curricula at the upper secondary level
have been merged to give a more balanced and practical education to all
students. However, these efforts are hampered by the inadequate qualifica-
tion of about half of the secondary school teachers. Thus, Government has
now made graduate qualifications mandatory for teachers in grades 9 through
12.
19.       To complement formal vocational training, the Government is
encouraging private employers to expand in-plant training schemes and has
established an Industrial Training Board to coordinate these efforts. In
addition, an Adult Education Board offers evening classes to teach skills
in short supply with the aim of promoting upward mobility for workers. The
three technical institutions in Singapore - the Singapore Technical
Institute, the Singapore Polytechnic and the Ngee Ann Technical College -
are being expanded, the latter two with assistance from UNDP and the Asian
Development Bank respectively. This expansion is expected to result in
enrollments increasing to 11,500 students in 1983 as compared with 7,600
in 1973.
20.       Comparatively, recent developments in university education have
been modest. Increased enrollment at the university level is necessary
to meet the economy's manpower requirements and to allow greater access to
professional employment. Study programs at the two universities - the
University of Singapore (enrollment 5,200) and Nanyang University (enroll-
ment 2,600) - have not been adequately adapted and coordinated to suit
the needs of an industrialized country such as Singapore.



- 6 -
21.       Coordination between the two universities, which appears to be
improvi.ng, is effected by Government representation on the governing
councils of both institutions. The University of Singapore emphasizes
professional courses, which represent two-thirds of its enrollment, while
Nanyang concentrates on humanities, Chinese studies and commerce which
together account for about 60 percent of its student body. The future
development of each university will continue its present emphasi.s. Enroll-
ments, growing at some 4 percent per annum, are expected to reach 7,500
students at the University of Singapore and some 4,000 students at Nanyang
by 1983.
PART IV - TIIE PROJECT
General
22.       The project is the second phase of a program to expand and relocate
the University of Singapore on a new site. The existing buildings of the
University are located at four different sites: (a) the main campus at
Bukit Timah, which houses the Faculties of Law, Arts, Social Sciences and
Physical Sciences and the School of Accountancy and Business Administratlon;
(b) the Faculty of Engineering, which is temporarily housed at the Poly-
technic; (c) the Faculty of Architecture, which is temporarily accommodated
in ex-military premises; and (d) the Faculties of Medicine, Dentistry and
the School of Pharmacy whlich occupy premises adjacent to the Singapore
General Hospital. None of these sites is suitable for the long range ex--
pansion of the University and continued dispersal of faculties and schools
would hamper seriously the integration of administrative and academic
services. Tiherefore, the University of Singapore, with UNDP assistance,
drew up a plhysical master plan in 1971 for a phased relocation and consolida-
tion of the University at a new site, Kent Ridge (a former military base)
about 10 miles from the center of Singapore.   The Bank made a loan of
US$9.5 nullion to Singapore in 1972 to finance the foreign exchange cost
of the first phase which consists of: (a) constructing, furnishing and
equippin5: of the Faculties of Engineering and ArchLtecture, the School of
Accountanicy and Business AdministratLon, and administrative, boarding and
othier supporting facilities; (b) constructing a computer center and providing
some equipmeant; and (c) providing specialist services to develop teaching
aids and to coordinate the execution of the project.
23.       After initial delays in the execution of this first plhase project,
the pihysical progress is now satisfactory.  However, due to the unexpectedly
steep rise in construction costs in Singapore since January 1973, the total.
project cost is expected to exceed the appraisal estimate of US$20 million
by about US$16.8 million equLivalent (84%); 27% of this increase is due to
exchange rate changes since appraisal. The new cost estimates are in line
with the construction costs of recently awarded construction contracts in
Singapore and expected trends.  The Government will finance the cost over-runs.
24.       The proposed project is the second phase of the relocation and
development of the University.   It was appraised in March/April 1973.  But,



-7-
because of the rapid construction cost increases, a follow-up appraisal
mission was sent out in October 1973. Negotiations were held in December
with a Singaporean delegation led by Dr. Toh Chen Chye, Minister of Science
and Technology and Vice Chancellor of the University. A Loan and Project
Summary is included as Annex III. The Appraisal Report No. 203a-SI dated
January 17, 1974, is being distributed separately.
Description
25.       The proposed second phase project, to be carried out by the
University of Singapore Development Unit (USDU), would include (a) the
construction, furnishing and equipping of the Faculties of Science, Arts
and Social Sciences, and Law together with administrative, boarding and
other supporting facilities at the new site at Kent Ridge about 10 miles
from the city center, and (b) consulting services. The relocation and
expansion of facilities will allow the University of Singapore to increase
total enrollments by 1983 to some 7,500 students, of which some 3,450 will
be enrolled in the faculties included in the second phase consolidation.
Project Costs and Financing
26.       The total cost of the project is estimated at about US$42.0 mil-
lion equivalent. Included in the total cost estimates are a 10 percent
physical contingency and annual price contingencies of 7.5 percent for
imported goods and services and 8.5 percent for local goods and services.
The proposed Bank loan of US$19.5 million would finance the foreign exchange
costs of the project, plus the local component of contracts likely to
be awarded to domestic suppliers after international competitive bidding,
estimated at about US$0.5 million (see para 31). The remainder would be
financed from the Government's education budget and would not constitute
an excessive burden on this budget. Public investment in education is
estimated at only 5 percent of total public investment in FY73/74. Given
the high priority assigned to University development, the Government's
investment commitment to the University's expansion is not excessive. More-
over, the recurrent expenditure for the expanded University is also modest.
In 1982, its total recurrent expenditure is expected to amount to about
US$37.9 million of which some US$32.2 million will be met by the Government,
constituting about 15 percent of all public recurrent education expenditures
in that year.
27.       Unit building costs - averaging about US$23 per square foot for
academic and communal facilities and about US$18 for boarding facilities -
are comparable to recent construction costs for similar facilities in
Singapore. Costs per student place are estimated at about US$7,500 and
about US$5,000 for academic and communal facilities, and boarding facilities
respectively. By comparison with other universities, standards of accom-
modation and equipment are reasonable.



-8-
Implementation
28.       The University of Singapore Development Unit will be responsible
for the execution of the project which is expected to require about six years.
The Unit's own architects will design all premises. In addition, consultants
will be employed for continuing guidance on campus plan coordination and
specialist engineering services. The University of Singapore Development
Unit's performance as project executor under the first loan has been satis-
factory and no major difficulties in implementation are foreseen.
Procurement and Disbursement
29.       All construction and supply contracts would be awarded on the
basis of international competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guide-
lines. Domestic manufacturers would be accorded a preference margin of
15 percent of the c.i.f. price of competing imports or the actual customs
duties, whichever is less. Local firms are likely to win the construction
and furniture contracts and foreign suppliers the equipment contracts.
30.       The loan would be disbursed against (a) the c.i.f. cost of
imported furniture and equipment, (b) 85% of imported but locally procured
furniture and equipment, (c) 95% of total ex-factory costs of locally
manufactured furniture and equipment, (d) 42% of the civil works costs,
equal to the estimated foreign exchange costs, and (e) the estimated
foreign costs of consultants' services.
31.       It is expected that local manufacturers will win the furniture
contracts, and the proposed Bank loan would finance, in addition to the
foreign exchange costs, the local cost component of such contracts
amounting to about US$0.5 million.
Justification
32.       An increase in the supply and improvement in the quality of high
level manpower is particularly important to Singapore at this time, in view
of the Government's objective to raise productivity levels throughout the
economy by using more capital intensive production methods in an effort to
counteract potential labor scarcity. The implementation of such a policy
would increase the economy's demands for managers, scientists and technicians
which the University will help to supply.
33.       The University of Singapore is the country's principal source of
high level manpower. By 1983 the University will be graduating 30 percent
of the total post-secondary graduates, including those from the technical
colleges. The first phase of its development, begun in 1972 with Bank
support (Loan 802-SI), will help to increase the supply of engineers,
architects and accountants. The second phase will expand the supply of
graduates in key areas such as science, economics and law. Specifically,
it would provide 40 percent of the scientists needed by Government, industry
and commerce; 100 percent of the pharmacists; and about 40 percent of the
teachers with graduate training necessary for the upgrading of secondary
school education.
