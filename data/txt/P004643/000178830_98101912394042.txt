REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(The University of Singapore)
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises a second education project in Singapore
for which a Bank Loan of US$19.5 million is proposed.
ii.       The education and training system of Singapore is well-developed
and has been responsive to the changing needs of a rapidly expanding economy.
About two-thirds of the relevant age group are enrolled in secondary schools
and some 4% of the relevant age group attend university courses. Shortages
of professional manpower are, however, becoming acute and may soon constrain
the growth of manufacturing and the development of social services. A
serious drawback in developing university education is that the University
of Singapore has much outmoded facilities dispersed at four different sites,
all located in highly congested central areas of the city. In order to
expand enrollment and improve the quality of instruction and research, the
Government has decided to relocate the University. The first phase of this
relocation comprises the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Architecture
and the School of Accountancy and Business Administration and is being
assisted under Loan 802-SI of 1972. The second phase, comprising the relo-
cation of the Faculties of Science, Arts and Social Sciences and Law and the
School of Pharmacy as a department in the Faculty of Science, would be helped
by the proposed second project. The third phase, planned for 1977 and com-
prising the Faculties of Medicine and Dentistry, would complete the reloca-
tion of the University.
iii.      The proposed project would consist of:
(a)  construction of, and provision of furniture and equipment
for, the Faculties of Science, Arts and Social Sciences
and Law, together with administrative, boarding and other
supporting facilities; and
(b)  professional fees for coordination of the campus master
plan and building design and the employment of consultants
for specialist engineering services.
iv.       As a result of the relocation, the capacity of the University
would increase from about 5,200 to 7,500 students and the distribution of
enrollment would be altered to better meet expected manpower needs for
economists, engineers, scientists and health personnel. Two-thirds of
the students would be in professional courses and 17% in arts and social
sciences, including economics and secondary teacher education.
v.        The first project was designed to help meet manpower needs in the
fields of engineering, architecture, accountancy and business administration.
The second project would also aim at meeting specific requirements for



- ii -
professionals. The Faculty of Science would double its output to provide
for secondary school teachers and to supply managers and scientists neces-
sary to industrial development; and an expanded supply of economists,
business lawyers and legal assistants would be available to meet the needs
of commerce and industry. Overall enrollment expansion of the University
would be about 4% p.a. during 1973-83, slightly higher than the growth of
the relevant age group; emphasis would be primarily on improvement of the
quality of instruction and research. With the relocation of the four
existing campuses on one site, buildings would be more functional and
equipment modernized, academic interaction between students in different
faculties would be improved, staff and facilities would be better utilized
and duplication of courses would be eliminated.
vi.       The University of Singapore Development Unit, which is supervising
implementation of the first project, would also be responsible for imple-
menting the second project. The architectural staff of this Unit would
design all buildings. Supporting engineering services by local consultants
would be used for all construction work.
vii.      Contracts for construction and for the procurement of furniture
and equipment would be awarded on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. It is expected that construc-
tion and most furniture contracts would be awarded to local firms and that
most equipment would be imported. Preferred domestic manufacturers of
furniture and equipment would be allowed a margin of preference equal to
the existing duties applicable to competing imports or 15% of the c.i.f. price,
whichever is the lower. At present, however, it is the practice of the
Singapore Government not to charge duties on imports for educational purposes.
viii.     The project would be completed in about six years from the
effective date of the Loan Agreement, including defects liability periods.
Construction would be completed in about five years.
ix.       The total project cost is estimated at US$42 million equivalent
including contingency allowances of US$11.8 million equivalent or about
39% of the basic project cost to meet unforeseen events and price in-
creases. These costs, though comparatively high, are based on recent cost
trends in Singapore and take due account of the Government program to check
inflationary pressures. The proposed financial plan provides for Bank
financing of the estimated foreign exchange component of US$19 million and
also the local currency portion of the ex-factory cost of furniture and
equipment likely to be procured locally, which amount is estimated at
US$0.5 million equivalent. The proposed loan of US$19.5 million, equivalent
to 46% of total project cost, would be disbursed to meet (a) 100% of the
c.i.f. cost of directly imported furniture and equipment; (b) 85% of the
total expenditure on imported but locally procured furniture and equipment;
(c) 95% of total ex-factory costs of locally manufactured furniture and equip-
ment;(d) 100% of the foreign costs of foreign campus planning and specialist



- iii -
engineering consultancy services; and (e) 42% of the cost of construction
and site development and of local engineering consultancy services.
x.        The proposed project is suitable as a basis for a loan of
US$19.5 million equivalent to the Republic of Singapore for a term of 20 years
including a six-year grace period.

APPRAISAL OF A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(The University of Singapore)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      In 1972, the Bank extended a loan of USS9.5 million (Loan 802-SI)
to assist in the implementation of the first phase of the University of
Singapore development plan. This first project is supporting the relocation
of the University from four scattered campuses to one new and more suitable
site and includes the Faculty of Engineering, the Faculty of Architecture
and the School of Accountancy and Business Administration. The proposed
second project would assist the transfer of the Faculties of Science, Arts
and Social Sciences and Law, and the School of Pharmacy as a department
in the Faculty of Science to the new site. It would comprise the construction
and equipping of these Faculties together with supporting facilities. The
total cost of the proposed project is estimated at US$42 million equivalent
and the foreign exchange component at US$19 million.
1.02      The proposed project was appraised in March/April, 1973, by a
mission comprising Messrs. S. Z. Sung (technical educator), D. H. Lewis
(architect), M. H. You (economist) and J. C. McKelvey (medical education
specialist, consultant).
II. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND MANPOWER NEEDS
Background
2.01      Singapore, an island republic situated at the southern tip of
the Malay Peninsula, has long been one of the most important commercial
and financial centers in South East Asia. It is, in fact, an urban island
with only 20% of its 226 square miles cultivated. With a population
slightly exceeding 2 million and comprising about 76% Chinese, 15%
Malays and 9% Indians, Pakistanis and others, Singapore is one of the
world's most densely populated countries (9,500 persons per sq mi). A
vigorous population control program has reduced annual population growth
from 2.5% in 1965 to 1.7% in 1972.
2.02      Lacking land, natural resources and sizeable domestic markets,
in the 1960s Singapore invested heavily in labor-intensive industries
and social services, such as public housing, health and education. Since
its separation from Malaysia in 1965, Singapore's GDP has increased at
an average rate of just under 14% p.a. and GDP per capita reached about
USS1,200 in 1972, the highest of any developing country in Asia. Industrial
output increased four-fold between 1966-72. The increment in manufacturing
value added accounted for one-third of GDP growth in 1972, making manu-
facturing the leading sector of the economy. Entrepot trade, once the
dominant sector, has been eclipsed in importance by industry. In short,
Singapore is changing from a predominantly trading center into a predomi-
nantly industrial one.



-2-
2.03      Several factors have made Singapore highly attractive for foreign
investment, namely: (a) a stable, pragmatic administration; (b) an indus-
trious, well-educated labor force; (c) a strategic geographical location;
(d) excellent communication and transport infrastructure; (e) well developed
facilities for banking and commerce; and (f) various investment incentives.
The number as well as the size of manufacturing firms has steadily increased.
The value of new investment commitments by foreign (USA, Japan, UK, Germany)
and joint ventures in the early 1970s exceed total foreign investments made
in the 1960s.  The Jurong Industrial Estate is already reaching its planned
capacity of 470 firms and 70,000 employment well ahead of schedule. Recent
investment emphasizes the development of sophisticated export goods (elec-
tronics, precision instruments, etc.) and oil processing.
2.04      The Government is currently reviewing plans for public sector
investment over the next five years and its program is not yet available.
However, a number of recent documents state clearly the Government's
objectives along with the policies to support their attainment. The
industrial development policy aims at maximizing productivity and making
optimum use of scarce labor by encouraging the establishment of skill-
intensive export industries. As an integral part of this policy, the
Government is becoming increasingly selective in the new industries it
encourages to come into the country. In the social sectors, the Government
aims at improving the welfare of a population living in an increasingly
more urbanized and industrialized city-state. This is to be achieved
by providing adequate educational, housing and health facilities and by
improving mass transport and pollution control. As the attainment of these
objectives requires price stability, the Government is concerned with the
necessity to check inflationary pressures; although in recent years the
cost-of-living index has grown by no more than 37 p.a., over the period
1967-72, wages for unskilled labor have increased by 8% p.a. and construc-
tion costs by over 10% p.a.
2.05      Bank staff projections indicated that in 1983 about 40-45% of
GDP will derive from manufacturing, an increasingly sophisticated sector
which will be responsible for US$2 billion equivalent of exports. This
growth pattern needs to be supported by increased skills, especially at
the professional level, in order to maintain Singapore's comparative
advantages in the world market. Additional manpower is also needed to
extend social services more evenly.
Manpower Requirements
2.06      Singapore's labor force has increased by 4.6% annually since
1966, reaching 751,000 in 1972, or 35% of the total population. 1/ As a
result of rapid growth, labor surpluses (e.g., over 8.7% of the labor force
was unemployed in 1965) were transformed into labor shortages in the
1/   Size of labor force is determined by assuming the following partici-
pation rates of age group, 15-64 years: 55.4% in 1966 and 58.4% in
1972.



early 1970s. Furthermore, the distribution of employment by economic
sector has dramatically changed with manufacturing now absorbing 25% of
total employment as against some 15% in the early 1960s. Increased
sophistication of industry has required a rapid expansion of employment
of professional and technical workers: recently, the number of jobs in
these categories has grown by about 14% p.a. in the private sector. Skill
shortages have appeared at all levels and have caused inflationary pressures
(para 2.04). The Government has therefore relaxed its immigration policy:
work permits issued to foreigners have increased from 4,500 in 1968 to
some 100,000 1/ in 1972. However, most of the immigrants are unskilled
and semi-skilled workers from neighboring countries and therefore the
shortages have been alleviated only at those levels of employment.
2.07       There are no official government estimates of employment growth
bv sector and occupation up to the early 1980s. A Bank staff projection
indicates that GDP in real terms will grow by some 11% p.a., and total
employment is likely to reach one million by 1983. Manufacturing is expected
to absorb about 33% of total employment and the service sectors some 60%.
Employment of professional and technical manpower is likely to increase from
49,600 in 1972 to 140,000 in 1983 to support industrial development and the
expansion of social services.
2.08      The manpower estimates made by the Ministry of Education and
the Economic Research Center of the Universitv of Singapore indicate that
over the next decade 250 science graduates p.a. would be needed annually to
provide teachers for the secondary schools. An additional 500 science
graduates would be required annually by private companies, the government
service and other statutory bodies in both managerial and research
capacity. Research is of great importance to ensure that rapid industrial
growth will not be associated with high social costs and damage to the
environment. This is particularly urgent in view of the emphasis on oil
and petrochemical manufacturing and of the need to adopt waste-free and
pollution-free production processes.
III.  THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING SECTOR
Evaluation of the System
3.01       Singapore's education and training system has been adapted well
to structural changes in the economy but further development is required at
the university level to satisfy socio-economic needs. Schools enroll
virtually all the relevant primary school age population (6-11), and
1/   Unofficial estimate.
2/   The education and training system is described in the Appendix and
the basic data are given in Annexes 1-2 and Charts 1-4.



-4-
nearly two thirds of the lower secondary age students (12-15) with 13% at
upper secondary level and 4% at university level. Population and enrollments
in the primary age group have been declining since 1969 and are expected to
begin declining for the secondary age group by 1978 (Annex 2). Free of
pressure to expand enrollments at the lower levels, the Government's policy
is to:  (a) improve the quality and practical relevance of secondary education;
(b) expand out-of-school education; (c) expand post-secondary technician
training; and (d) develop university education.
3.02      To improve the content of general education, curricula have been
updated, wide use made of modern teaching nethods such as educational
television, and centralized workshops have been established at the lower
secondary level to provide pre-vocational courses. The general and tech-
nical streams at upper secondary level have been recently merged to give
all students a more balanced instruction including practical subjects.
However, full benefit from these changes is hampered by the inadequate
qualification of about half of the secondary school teachers (Annex 3).
Government policy for quality improvement includes the exclusive employment
of graduate teachers for grades 9-12 by 1983.
3.03      To complement vocational training and to reduce the shortages of
skilled workers, the Government has encouraged private companies to conduct
accelerated in-plant training schemes. Beginning in 1973, this skill training
is being coordinated by an Industrial Training Board. An Adult Education
Board organizes evening classes to teach skills in short supply and to
prepare workers for promotion.
3.04      Requirements for technicians are being met by an expanded program
assisted by the Asian Development Bank and UNDP. As a result of these
developments, the three institutions concerned, the Singapore Polytechnic,
Ngee Ann Technical College and the Singapore Technical Institute, are
expected to enroll 11,500 students in 1983 compared with 7,600 in 1973.
3.05      Past developments in university education have been modest as
compared with expansion and improvement at the other levels. Expansion
at university level is needed, not only to meet manpower requirements
(paras 2.06-2.08) but also to improve access to higher education and pro-
fessional employment. Qualitatively, whilst at the other levels programs
have been modernized and collaboration among institutions and between the
education system and industry has been made more effective, the two univer-
sities of the country have not fully coordinated their course offerings.
Their facilities occupy as many as five different campuses and present
premises, particularly those for the sciences, are not, in general, suitable
to the higher education standards required in an industrialized country at
Singapore's level of development.
Development of University Education
3.06      Singapore has two universities:  the public University of
Singapore (enrollment 5,200) and the private but publicly assisted Nanyang
University (enrollment 2,600). The University of Singapore gives a com-
prehensive range of courses in seven Faculties and four Schools and uses



- 5 -
English as language of instruction while Nanyang University has three
Faculties and the courses are taught mainly in the Chinese language.
Development of the two universities is coordinated by government senior
officials who are members of the governing councils of both institutions.
This method of coordination has not been fully effective in the past
(para 3.05) but is now improving. Overall enrollment has increased from
5,000 in 1965 to 7,800 in 1973 (Annex 2) and is planned to reach some 11,500
in the early eighties. Within this context the University of Singapore will
develop as the principal center of higher learning and research and give
emphasis to professional courses representing two-thirds of its enrollment,
while Nanyang University will emphasize humanities, Chinese studies and
commerce, courses which account for 60% of its student body.
3.07      The University of Singapore presently suffers from its physical
dispersion among campuses at four different sites.  The main campus at
Bukit Timah 1/ contains the Faculties of Law, Arts and Social Sciences,
Physical Sciences and the School of Accountancy and Business Administration.
The Faculty of Engineering is temporarily housed at the Polytechnic; the
Faculty of Architecture is temporarily accommodated in leased premises. The
Faculties of Medicine, Dentistry and the School of Pharmacy occupy premises
adjacent to Outram Road General Hospital. This separation has caused dup-
lication of courses, has prevented interdisciplinary contact between students
in different faculties and has adversely affected utilization of staff and
facilities. None of the four existing sites is capable of accommodating
the entire university.
3.08      The Government has therefore decided to consolidate and expand
the university on a 425-acre site at Kent Ridge. The quantitative plan
for the relocation and development of the University is summarized in the
following table:
1/   The main Bukit Timah campus covers 130 acres in a relatively central
and high cost residential area of the city. However, existing build-
ings (35-40 years old) occupy about two-thirds of the only high ground
available on this site. The remainder is low-lying flat land subject
to flood during the heavy rains and is too soft to support heavy
construction. Thus, the site is not adequate for university expansion.

This plan will allow undergraduate enrollments to expand by some 4% p.a. to
reach about 7,200 students in 1983. The distribution of enrollments by subject
in 1983 would be altered to approximate more closely to the expected manpower
needs for scientists (para 2.08) and health personnel. The projected distribu-
tion of enrollments indicates about two thirds in professional studies and 17%
in arts and social sciences.
3.09      Detailed plans for the Nanyang University are still under prepara-
tion but government projections indicate that the enrollment of this Univer-
sity would reach 4,000 students in 1983 (Annex 2). Because of the uncertainty
concerning the Nanyang University expansion and the effect that this might
have on the proposed project, agreement was reached with the Government
during negotiations that the Bank would be supplied with any higher education
development plan which the Government may propose within the next five years.
3.10      The plans for relocation of the University of Singapore are
sound. The site, about ten miles from the city center, is between the
Jurong Industrial Estate (para 2.03) and the city's commercial districts.
Public transport is available and mass transit will be routed nearby. There
are plans to make productive use of the space vacated by the relocation.
The Polytechnic campus of the Engineering Faculty will revert to the
Singapore Port Authority. The lease for the architecture campus will be
terminated. The Ministry of Finance is currently studying ways to use the
Bukit Timah campus.

Education Finance
3.11      Although total public expenditures in education increased by 47%
from S$ 156 million in 1967 to S$ 230 million in 1972/73 (Annex 4), there
was a decline in the share of education in national expenditure. During
this period, public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP fell
from 4.2% to 3.1% and as a percentage of Government budget from about 23%
to 12%. These declines, however, were the result of more rapid growth in
GDP (14% p.a.) and government expenditures (21% p.a.) than education
expenditures (8% p.a.) and did not imply an erosion in the quality of
education. Average expenditure per student increased by 5% p.a. in real
terms over the period.
3.12      In accordance with the priority assigned to development of the
University of Singapore the share of total education recurrent expenditure
devoted to the University, which increased slightly from 8.1% in 1967 to
8.6% in 1972/73, is expected to increase to about 15% in 1983. Allowing
for enrollment and quality increases, total recurrent expenditure is
expected to reach S$ 88 million in 1983, of which about 13% would be met
from student fees and 85% from Government revenues.
IV. THE PROJECT
General Features
4.01      A master plan has been prepared with UNDP assistance for relocat-
ing and expanding the University of Singapore on Kent Ridge. This master
plan establishes a framework for the long-term development of the University,
phases investment programs in its support and provides guidelines for the
design of buildings. The proposed project would assist the second phase of
the relocation of the University and would consist of the following items:

/1   Includes about 400 student places specifically provided for six
pre-clinical departments included in the Center.
/2   Represents 300 scientists and 20 pharmacists.
Prject Items
4.02      The Facuilty of Science, which now enrolls less than 600 students
in eight departments, would absorb the School of Pharmacy as a department
and double its enrollment to 1,300; annual output would reach about 320
including 20 pharmacists in the early 1980s. This output, together with an
estimated annual output of 400 from Nanyang University, would approximate
to forecast requirements (para 2.08). The Faculty of Science has a service
function for the rest of the University as it conducts courses for students
in humanities, engineering, architecture, medicine, dentistry and pharmacy.
As a part of the Faculty, the Biological Sciences Center includes also the
pre-clinical departments of the Faculties of Dentistry and Medicine; its
facilities would be shared with the Faculties of Dentistry and Medicine.
The present School of Pharmacy with 70 students and about 15 graduates a year
is the smallest section in the University. It supplies not only pharmacists
but also chemists for the new pharmaceutical and nutrition industry in
Singapore. Its capacity would be increased by 40% to 100 and the output
to 20 p.a.



- 9 -
4.03      In addition to the required lecture rooms and other teaching
spaces, this item would include about US$1.2 million equivalent for equip-
ment to modernize laboratory teaching and research (para 3.05). Emphasis
would be placed on chemistry and physics in support of the developing
petrochemical and electronics industries.
4.04      The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, which comprises twelve
denartments, provides basic courses to other departments and trains its own
students in fields such as mathematics, languages, area studies, and econo-
mics and statistics. Enrollment in the Faculty (860 in 1972) is expected
to increase by about 50% by 1983 in order to meet projected needs in
teaching, government, commerce and industry. The proposed project would
provide the lecture theaters, tutorial/seminar rooms, furniture and equip-
ment (mainly audio-visual teaching aids) for about 1,200 students (about
17% of the total enrollment).
4.05      The Faculty of Law enrolls 400 and graduates 75 students annually.
Curricula emphasize international, maritime, industrial and labor law and
the professionals trained in the Faculty are much in demand in commerce and
manufacturing. Demand is expected to increase as a result of the increase
in the size otf the firms operating in Singapore.  The project would support
a modest expansion of the Faculty to 550 students with an annual output
of about 110.
4.06      The supporting facilities would include common teaching and
administrative premises, boarding places, recreational services and a
multipurpose hall to be used for examinations and meetings. The number of
lecture theaters, tutorial and seminar rooms provided for common use by all
Faculties is based on optimum utilization by the whole university. Labora-
tories and special rooms would be provided within the various faculties
and schools. An additional 300 boarding places to the 900 provided under
the first project would be included to allow most students an opportunity
of living in the university for one year. Six apartments for supervisory
staff would be provided as a part of the boarding facilities.
Staff and Staff Development
4.07      The development plan for the university requires an increase in
teaching staff from 420 to 585 by 1983 in order to maintain a student/staff
ratio of 12:1. The staff attrition rate has been 10% p.a. during the past
four years, the principal reason being the level of salaries compared with
the private sector. The University has recently increased its salary
scales and, to improve further its competitive position, it is reviewing
its recruitment procedures and in-service training schemes. Australia, Japan,
New Zealand, the United Kingdom and bilateral agencies such as the Ford
Foundation are providing fellowships and experts to the University.

4.10      Unit building costs, which average US$23.25 per sq ft for
academic and communal facilities and US$18.30 for boarding facilities, are
in line with the cost of recent construction of similar facilities in
Singapore. Consultancy costs include provision for continuing guidance
by a campus plan coordinator and specialist engineering services in
support of architectural design which would be carried out by the
University of Singapore Development Unit architects.
4.11      Furniture and equipment cost estimates are based on the loan
request prepared by the University authorities as reviewed during appraisal.
Detailed lists would be prepared during the building design stage and
reviewed by the Bank before procurement. Cost estimates for furniture and
equipment do not include import duties and taxes as educational materials
are at present exempted from all duties and taxes.
4.12      The foreign exchange component of US$19 million equivalent,
representing 45% of total project cost, has been calculated as follows:
construction and site development, 42%; furniture, 50%; equipment, 90%;
foreign consultancy services, 80%; and local consultancy services, 10%.
4.13      Construction costs, which had increased by about 1% per month
during 1971-1972, rose about 50% in the first nine months of 1973 due to
sharp increases in the cost of materials and labor. The rate of escalation
has now fallen to about 2% per month and, while this rate is expected to
slow down further by mid-1974, it seems unlikely to fall below 8% per annum
in the foreseeable future. The contingency allowance included in the
project cost estimate therefore provides for price increases which, (a) in
the case of construction costs and related professional fees, cover an
initial increase of about 2% per month until mid-1974 and thereafter increases
of 7-1/2% p.a. for foreign exchange costs and 8-1/2% for local costs and
(b), in the case of equipment and furniture, cover increases of 7-1/2% p.a.
for foreign exchange costs and 8-1/2% for local costs. The contingency
allowance also includes a factor for unforeseen events, equal to 10% of
estimated costs for all project elements. The contingency allowance, 28%
of the total project cost and 39% of the basic cost before adding contin-
gencies, while comparatively high in comparison with previous figures, is
considered reasonable under present conditions. Annex 6 indicates the
computation.



- 13 -
4.14      Estimated costs per student place, excluding contingency allowances
and professional fees, are as follows:
Costs per Student Place or Living Unit in US$
Sq ft per        Site
Type of         Student Place   Develop-   Build-   Furni-    Equip-
Facilities      or Living Unit   ment         ings      ture     ment      Total
Academic, Admin.
and Communal         225         1,300       5,230    250        720      7,500
Students'
Hostels              215           970       3,885    240        105      5,200
Staff
Apartments         1,850         8,500      34,000       -         -    42,500
These unit costs are not comparable with facilities in other Bank Group-
financed education projects due to differences in levels, lengths, complex-
ity and specialization of courses. In addition, space and equipment require-
ments for the pre-clinical training included in the Faculty of Science are
particularly high. Unit costs for the first education project in Singapore
were estimated at US$3,800 for academic and communal facilities and $2,600
for boarding facilities at 1971 prices and exchange rates. The higher
unit costs in the second project are due to cost escalation (para 2.04),
the change in the exchange rates (+ 22.5%), the greater proportion of
facilities requiring higher unit building and equipment costs and the
higher proportion of supporting facilities required for the complete
relocation of the University.
4.15      Financial Plan.  The proposed Bank Loan would finance the total
estimated foreign exchange component of US$19 million and also the local
currency portion of the ex-factory cost of furniture and equipment which
may be procured locally after international competitive bidding which
amount is estimated at US$0.5 million equivalent. The balance of the
estimated local currency cost of the project (US$22.5 million equivalent)
can be met by the Government without curtailing expenditure for other
activities and without overburdening the education budget.
4.16      The recurrent cost of the Faculties included in the second
project is estimated to increase from S$ 6.3 million in 1973 to about
S$ 24.3 million in 1983. The additional S$ 18.0 million would amount
to about 20% of the projected university budget for 1982/83 and to about
3.1% of all public recurrent education expenditures in the same year.

V. IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT
Implementation
5.01      Execution of the Project.  In view of the complexities in site
development and the relative sophistication of the facilities required, the
proposed project would take about six years to complete including defects
liability periods following construction (Chart 5).
5.02      Administration.  The University of Singapore Development Unit
(USDU) has been competently organizing and controlling the implementation
of the first project. During negotiations, the Government provided
assurances that the USDU would be maintained for the full period of second
project implementation with an establishment commensurate with its efficient
operation, including a project director and a project architect with quali-
fications and experience acceptable to the Government and the Bank.
5.03      The unit would be responsible for the financial and administrative
control of the project and its proper execution, including: (a) liaison
and coordination with the campus planner whose consultancy contract would
be extended as necessary under the provisions of the project; (b) the design
of all project buildings in accordance with the campus master plan and the
preparation of construction drawings and documents; (c) the engagement,
briefing and coordination of engineering consultants; (d) the preparation
of master lists of furniture and equipment; (e) the organization of inter-
national competitive bidding for civil works, furniture and equipment;
(f) the supervision of construction and procurement; (g) coordination with
Ministries and other Agencies concerned with the project; (h) liaison with
the Bank; and (i) the preparation of withdrawal applications.
5.04      Project Design Services.  The master plan for the physical develop-
ment of the university provides a framework for the related disposition
of faculties, schools and departments on the new site and flexible archi-
tectiural guidelines for the design of buildings. With guidance from the
campus planner, USDU architects would design all premises but would need
consultant services for structural, electrical and specialist engineering
design.
5.05      Construction.  Construction contracts would be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding by pre-qualified contractors in ac-
cordance with Bank Guidelines. It is expected that contracts will be awarded
to local firms as the country has a competitive construction industry.
5.06      Procurement of Furniture and Equipment.  Contracts for the supply
of furniture and equipment would be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Preferred
domestic manufacturers would be accorded a preferential margin of 15% of the
c.i.f. price of competing imports or the rate of customs duty applicable,
whichever is the lower. It is expected that most furniture contracts would



- 15 -
be awarded to local manufacturers and equipment contracts to foreign
suppliers. Singapore does not participate in any regional arrangement
which gives preferential import duties to certain foreign suppliers.
5.07      Maintenance.  The allocation for maintenance of University build-
ings has been adequate in recent years, amounting to 6%-10% of the University
budget.
Project Monitoring Indicators
5.08      It was agreed during negotiations that, during the project
implementation period and for five years thereafter, the Project Unit
would collect each year and furnish to the Bank the following indicators
to serve for project monitoring and as an evaluation mechanism:
(a)  the enrollment figure at the beginning of each academic
year by Faculties and Schools, to serve as a quantitative
indicator;
(b)  th2 number of graduates in each Faculty or School in
comparison to the original intake, to serve as an internal
efficiency indicator;
(c)  the number of graduates employed from each Faculty or School
within six months after graduation, to serve as an external
productivity indicator; and
(d)  the number of applicants (first choice only) against the
number of intake in each Faculty or School to show the
trends of demand for places in that Faculty or School.
Disbursement
5.09      The proposed loan of US$19.5 million would finance the estimated
foreign exchange component (US$19 million) of the total project cost and
the local currency portion of the ex-factory cost of furniture and equipment
which may be procured locally after international competitive bidding
(para 5.06). It would be disbursed to meet:
(a)  100% of the c.i.f. cost of directly imported furniture
and equipment;
(b)  85% of the total expenditure on imported but locally
procured furniture and equipment;
(c)  95% of total ex-factory costs of locally manufactured
furniture and equipment;
(d)  100% of the foreign exchange costs of foreign campus
planning and architectural consultancy services; and



- 16 -
(e)  42% of the total cost of construction and site develop-
ment and of local engineering consultancy services, this
percentage representing the average foreign exchange
component.
The percentage of (e) above would be adjusted as necessary to spread dis-
bursement over the estimated project implementation period of about six-
and-a-half years (Chart 5). The schedule of estimated disbursement is
given in Annex 7.
VI. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The University of Singapore is the country's principal source of
high level manpower. The proposed second loan would further assist its
relocation, consolidation and expansion which was started with Bank support
under Loan 802-SI. The relocation is necessary to overcome existing
physical constraints on expansion. The consolidation is required to
improve educational quality, management and economy. The expansion is
needed to supply the high level manpower that is important to the success
of Singapore's development strategy.
6.02      The second phase would contribute to increasing the supply of
professional manpower in needed areas such as economics, law, and science,
including science teaching. Specifically, the second project would meet
the following manpower requirements in the early 1980s:
(a) 40% of the scientists needed by government, commerce
and industry (para 2.08); and
(b)  40% of the graduate teachers needed to improve the
quality of secondary education (paras 2.08 and 3.02).
6.03      Equally important, the second project would help build a stronger
institution by integrating the previously dispersed Faculties and School
of the University. Academic integration would broaden the scope and improve
the quality of instruction. Physical integration would facilitate adminis-
trative efficiency and would promote economies in the use of facilities and
staff. In particular, if the University had to continue to operate on
four separate campuses, there would be a need for 20%-30% more common
facilities than provided on the integrated site.
6.04      In short, the proposed second project is justified on the basis
of its contribution to satisfying needs for professional manpower, its
contribution to institution building and its contribution to economies
of operation.

REPUBLIC OF SINGAPORE
APPRAISAL OF A SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(The University of Singapore)
Education and Training
The System
1.        Education and training in Singapore (Charts 1 and 2) has recently
undergone major changes to meet manpower needs in commerce and industry
and support the expansion of social services. As noted in paras. 3.01 and
3.02 of the main report, curricula and teaching lmethods have been updated at
various levels of education. Enrollment in technical schools has expanded
very rapidly and out-of-school programs have been encouraged and coordinated.
In addition, the four language streams (English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil)
are being e:li.;nated in order to fully integrate the education system.
Administration and Planning
2.        Education planning and administration are divided among several
ministries. The Ministry of Education (Chart 1) is responsible for adminis-
tration and formulation of education policy. The Ministry of Science and
Technology administers the Singapore Polytechnic as well as the University of
Singapore. The Ministry of Culture coordinates the Government's ETV programs
and the Ministry of Law and National Development is in charge of an agricultural
training scheme. The supervision of schools is carried out mainly by an
inspectorate under the direction of the Chief Inspector of Schools of the
Ministry of Education. A research and planning unit in the same Ministry
assists qualitative improvements by conducting educational research and
updating continuously curricula, evaluation and promotion procedures.
3.        The structure of education (Chart 2) consists of six years of
primary education betwqeen the ages of 6 and 11 and four years of secondary
education between 12 and 15 which may be followed by either 2 years of pre-
university and then three or more years of university education or three
years in technical institutions. Enrollment ratios fall sharply from about
63% at the secondary level to about 13% in the pre-university classes (Chart
3) and some 85% of the age group at 16 and 17 join the labor force. For
this group, the technical content in the secondary school curriculum for boys
(carried out in centralized workshops) and the commercial content for girls
play an important role in preparing students for employment in industry
and commerce.
4.        Primary education is free but not compulsory.  The enrollment ratio
increased from 90% in 1970 to 107% in 1972 (Chart 3) due to repeaters in
the last grade of primary schools. As a result, the progression rate from
primary to secondary schools dropped from 77% in 1970 to less than 60%

in 1972. Those who do not enter secondary school join the labor force
after an intermediate period in vocational institutes. The number of
qualified teachers in primary schools is increasing and reached about 85%
of the 10,800 teachers in 1972. Class sizes will be reduced from 38 in
1972 to 35 by 1978 but the ratio of 1.27 teachers per class will be
maintained. The quality of primary education is good. The curriculum
is also suitable for those who proceed to vocational institutes and then
join the labor force instead of secondary education.
5.        Secondary education enrollment at about 180,000 in 1973 (Annex 2)
will slightly decrease to 176,000 by 1983 to maintain approximately the
present enrollment ratio. Of the 7,000 teachers, only about 30% are university
graduates. The Government's policy is to achieve 100% university graduate
teachers for grades 9-12 and to reduce class size from about 38 to 30 by 1983.
The number of teachers per class will remain at 1.6. It is estimated
that more than 5,000 university graduates will have to be recruited as
teachers before 1983 (Annex 3).
6.        Enrollment in pre-university classes is estimated at about 15,000
in 1973 (Annex 2). The curriculum, previously designed for university
preparation only, is being modified by granting more elective subjects to
benefit those who terminate at this level. These classes are being removed
from secondary schools where they are now located and concentrated in
junior colleges to improve the utilization of staff and facilities.
Quantitatively, the enrollment ratio of about 13% will be slightly increased
to provide an adequate number of qualified candidates for the two universities.
7.        Training of primary school teachers at the level of grades 11 and
12 has been replaced by courses at post-secondary level (grades 13 and 14)
to improve quality. This measure is feasible because primary enrollment is
expected to decrease from 350,000 at present to 300,000 in 1978 and then
slightly increase to 320,000 in 1983; therefore the number of primary school
teachers required for the next ten years (about 2,000) is small. The courses
are conducted in the newly established Institute of Education which runs a
two-year full-time post-HSC 1/ course for primary and lower secondary
(grades 7 and 8) school teachers, and a one-year post-graduate course for
degree holders to teach at grade 9 and above. Technical teacher training
is carried out in the Singapore Technical Institute.
8.        Apart from the two universities and the Institute of Education
(para 7), there are three technical institutions at the post-secondary
level: the Singapore Polytechnic is mainly responsible for training
senior technicians, the Ngee Ann Technical College, for both senior and
junior technicians; and the Singapore Technical Institute, for junior
technicians and advanced craftsmen. The three institutions will expand

at an examination at the end of the pre-university courses or grade 12.

from 7,600 students in 1973 to 11,500 by 1983 and their annual output of
about 4,000 technicians should meet the need of sub-professionals in the
eighties.
9.        The Adult Education Board and the Industrial Training Board
(established in April, 1973) are responsible for non-formal education and
skill training. Apprenticeship schemes are developing slowly.
Development of Higher Education
10.       The development of university education in Singapore started in
the fifties and accelerated in the sixties, due partly to the change from
a colony to a sovereign state with increasing needs for manpower at graduate
level and partly to new demands arising from structural changes in the
economy. Total enrollment in the two universities in Singapore has reached
7,800 in 1973 and is planned at 11,500 in 1983 with an annual growth rate of
some 4%. This modest rate of expansion is a result, not of financial constraints,
but of prudent government policy based on cautious manpower projections. Within
the planned total increase in capacity of 3,700 in 10 years, engineering
accounts for the largest share, about 25%.
11.       Higlier education institutions in Singapore are selective in their
admission procedures. University candidates for undergraduate programs
must hold a Higher School Certificate (IISC) and pass an entrance examination.
This applies also for candidates coming from neighboring countries. For
higher degrees, IIaster's candidates normally hold a Bachelor's degree
and demonstrate ability to research; Ph.D candidates have either a Master's
degreq (Arts or Science) or a professional degree in medicine or dentistry.
Diploma level institutions accept students who, as a minimum, have passed
the School Certificate Examination (SCE) 1/.
12.       Responsibility for higher education is shared between two ministries.
The Ministry of Education is responsible for Nanyang University, teacher
training and two technical colleges; the Ministry of Science and Technology
administers the University of Singapore and the Polytechnic. Although there
is no national coordinating agency for higher education, the various minis-
tries are relating the expansion of higher education to manpower requirements.
13.       Nanyang University first recruited students in 1956 and was
established by Government Act in 1959.  Enrollment has now reached 2,600
in three faculties, namely, arts, science and commerce. Its ten-year
development plan has not yet been decided upon by the University Council.
However, total enrollment in 1983 as projected by the Ministry of Education
is 4,000.

14.       The University of Singapore (Chart 4), established in 1962,
offers undergraduate programs, graduate studies and diploma courses at
seven faculties (Arts and Social Sciences, Law, Science, Medicine, Dentistry,
Engineering and Architecture), four schools (Pharmacy, Accountancy and
Business Administration, Post-Graduate Medical Studies and Post-Graduate
Dental Studies) and three centers (Biological Sciences, Economic Research
and Language). The Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, the Unesco
Regional Institute for Higher Education and Development and the Unesco
Regional Marine Biology Center are also located within the University
complex. Enrollment reached 5,200 in 1973. Present Government policy
is to limit further quantitative expansion except in engineering and science
for which a faster growth is needed to meet the requirements of industry
and the teaching force. Total enrollment is expected to reach 7,500 in
1983 (Annex 2) including about 300 graduate students. The 420 full-time
teaching staff which gives a teacher-student ratio of 1:12 is estimated to
increase to 580 by 1983 to maintain the present teacher-student ratio.
15.       The Faculty of Science has eight departments (Anatomy 1/, Bio-
chemistry 1/, Botany, Chemistry, Mathematics 2/, Physics, Physiology 1/
and Zoology) and offers eight programs, namely, Biology, Applied Biology,
Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, Chemistry, Applied Chemistry,
Physics and Applied Physics. The curricula are strongly oriented to industrial
needs. Servicing other Faculties/Schools is a major function of this Faculty,
mainly through its Biological Sciences Center for the Faculties of Medicine
and Dentistry and School of Pharmacy. The quality of the courses would be
improved with additional equipment. All staff are well qualified.
16.       The Faculty of Medicine has thirteen pre-clinical and clinical
departments, namely, Anatomy, Biochemistry, Physiology, Bacteriology,
Parasitology, Pharmacology, Pathology, Social Medicine and Public Health,
Medicine, Paediatrics, Orthopaedic Surgery, Surgery and Obstetrics and
Gynaecology. The duration of the course is five years of which the first
two are for pre-clinical courses and the latter three for clinical
subjects. A low teacher-student ratio of 1 to 6 will be maintained due
to the specialized nature of the courses. Staff shortages for Surgery
courses are being met by part-time lecturers.
17.       There are three specialized departments in the Faculty of
Dentistry, namely, Operative Dentistry, Prosthetic Dentistry and Oral
Surgery. Much of the dental equipment is obsolete and requires
replacement. The teacher-student ratio of 1:9 will be maintained and is
reasonable for dental courses.
1/   Common with the Faculty of Medicine.
2/   Common with the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences.  However the
Applied Mathematics course offered by the Science Faculty is not in
common with the Statistics course offered by the Arts and Social
Sciences Faculty.



APPENDIX
Page 5
18.       The School of Pharmacy, the smallest unit in the University,
would become a department in the Faculty of Science with a planned enrollment
of 100 by 1983. The course offered meets the needs of retail pharmacy,
hospital pharmacy and the pharmaceutical industry. Teacher-student ratio
will be 1:10 by 1983, slightly below the average of 1:12 for the University
due to the nature of the course.
19.       The Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences has twelve departments
(Chinese Studies, Economics and Statistics, English Language and Literature,
Geography, History, Malay Studies, Mathematics, Music, Philosophy,
Political Science, Social Work and Sociology) and offers fourteen programs
and servicing functions to other Faculties. The Economics and Statistics
Department is the largest. This Faculty uses the facilities of the
Language Center and works closely with the Economic Research Center.
Staff are well qualified.
20.       The Faculty of Law has one department, the Law Department.
Emphasis is on such subjects as International Business Transactions,
Commercial Transactions, Conveyancing, Public International Law, Labour Law,
Shipping Law Banking and Negotiable Instruments and Industrial Relations.
Staff shortages force the Faculty to depend heavily on part-time staff.
However, this arrangement is satisfactory since courses are taught by
practitioners who are up-to-date on realistic issues.
21.       Appraisal Report No. PE-38a contains information on the
Faculties/Schools included in the first project.
Education Finance
22.       The Government finances not only public education but also the
"aided schools" 1/ in meeting virtually all recurrent expenditures and part
of capital expenditure. During 1967-72, the public education expenditure
increased at 8.3% annually as compared with 21.5% annual increase in
total government expenditures; consequently, the share of education in
the government budget decreased from 23% to 11.5%. During the same period,
public education expenditure as a percentage of GDP fell from 4.2% to
3.1%, mainly due to the faster growth of GDP (13.9% p.a.), in comparison
with growth of the education sector. These declining percentages, however,
did not imply deterioration in the quality of education.
23.       The share of secondary and higher education in recurrent
expenditure increased during 1967-72 as expansion of primary enrollment
fell. This trend will accelerate as primary enrollment further declines
due to the family planning program (Annex 2).
24.       In 1972, the Government began to revise the terms and conditions
of employment in the Education Service to bring teachers' remuneration
1/   Mission and private schools receiving government financial assistance
for teachers' salaries are "aided schools".



APPENDIX
Page  6
closer to salaries in the private sector. Following this revision, large
scale upgrading and promotion exercises for principals and teachers were
launched and are now nearing completion. Consequently, teachers' salaries
in Singapore will be near the highest in Asia.
25.       The budgets of the two universities are both controlled by
the Ministry of Finance. The Nanyang budget, after its Council's approval,
is examined by the Ministry of Education while that of the University of
Singapore is reviewed by the Ministry of Science and Technology. Governed by
an economy-minded university development policy, high priority usually is
given to production-oriented departments and the budget presented by each
faculty or school normally is thoroughly scrutinized before it reaches the
Ministry of Finance.
26.       The Government approved SS 33.2 million recurrent expenditures
for the two universities for FY 1973/74, representing 12.8% of the total
recurrent education expenditure and a 16% increase from the previous year.
About 80% of the total recurrent expenditures for the two universities
(S$ 27 million) are appropriated to the University of Singapore. Approxi-
mately 85% of the recurrent expenditure for Nanyang University is provided
by the Government.
27.       Fees, as a source of university revenue, are relatively small,
and contribute only 13% to the university budget. Each student pays
S$ 500-600 tuition fee yearly, depending on fields of study. The University
proposes no significant increase in tuition fees in the foreseeable future.
Recurrent cost per student averages S$ 4,500.
