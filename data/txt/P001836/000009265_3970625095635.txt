MAURITANIA
SN1M REHABILITATION PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Soci-te Nationale IQdustrielle et Miniere (SNIM).
Amount:               US$20.0 million.
Terms:                Repayable in 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at
the Bank standard variable interest rate plus a
guarantee fee to the Government of 1OZ of the
variable interest rate.
Project Objectives    SNIM's increasing production costs and debt service,
and Description:      both due to the now completed Guelbs Project, require
tight financial management in the coming years. The
Project's main objective is to secure the mediuw-term
financial and economic viability of SNIM, one of the
most valuable assets of the Mauritanian economy. The
Project would consolidate and furtber advance the
ongoing action program for managerial and technical
improvements and would in particular:
Ci) help SNIK contidue to improve its management and
reduce its production costs; and
(ii) assist with the necessary financial
restructuring of SNIM by transforming part of
its short-term debt/overdraft into long-term
debt.
The Project consists of Ci) measures by SNIM aimed at
improvements and cost reductions in management,
operations, procurement and investments, personnel,
overhead costs and cash management; and (ii) purchase
of equipment and supplies, and provision of training
and technical assistance necessary for the
implementation of these measures.
Project Risks:        The Project faces maj:.- financial, but also
managerial, commercial and technical risks. Sound
project preparation, conservative assumptions for the
financial projections and the fact that SKIN has
already successfully started its rehabilitation
program limit the risks to an acceptable level.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Mauritania has requested the Bank's assistance
in financing a project for the rehabilitation of Societe Nationale
Industrielle et Miniere (SNIM), the parastatal company in charge of iron
ore mining in Mauritania. The estimated cost of the Rehabilitation Project
is US$92.2 million, of which SNIM will contribute US$36.4 million out of
its internal cash generation. The Bank and the other colenders: Kuwait
Fund, Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AEESD), Abu Dhabi
Fund, Saudi Fund, Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan (OECF) and
Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique (CCCE) will finance the balance
of US$55.8 million. The Bank contributes US$20.0 million equivalent.
1.02      The proposed Rt-abilitation Project will be the Bank's third
intervention in the iron ore sector in Mauritania. In 1960, a Bank loan
amounting to US$66 million out of a total project cost of US$190 million
was made to Societe Anonyme des Mines de Fer de Mauritanie (MIFERMA), a
company owned predominantly by French, British, German, and Italian
interests. -j The loan was requested to finance the development of the
Iedia iron ore deposits, the exploitation of which started in 1963 (Map
IBRD 19049). In 1979, the Board approved a US$60 million loan to SNIM to
finance part of the first phase of the Guelbs Iron Ore Project, the
development of a new iron ore mine, beneficiation plant and infrastructure
to replace the gradually depleting Kedia mines. 2/ In addition to the Bank
loan and to the equity principally from Arab leIing institutions and
governments, SNIM financed the Guelbs project with about US$278 million of
loans from Arab development banks (65%) and European and Japanese
development banks (35Z).
1.03      SNIM's operations are critically Important for Mauritania.  In
1983, iron ore mining accounted directly for about 9X of Mauritania's GDP
at market prices and represented about 40% of its foreign exchange
earnings. Since 1981, the Guelbs Iron Ore project has 'ad several
problems: (i) a three-year commissioning delay (the first Guelbs ore was
shipped in March 1985 instead of 1982); (ii) SNIM sales in 1978-83
decreased to about 7-8 million tonnes per year (tpy) from the 10-12 m-illion
tpy envisaged at appraisal, mostly because of the depressed iron ore
market; (iii) iron ore prices in real terms are at present 15S below
appraisal estimates; and (iv) decreasing productivity. While these
problems have already affected SNIM's financial position seriously, they
will be further compounded starting in 1985 by the start of the repayment
of the US$338 million Guelbs loans.

-2-
1.04      SNIM has formulated a series of measures in a rehabilitation
program that will help (i) face the Company's debt service difficulties;
and (ii) restore its financial viability in the medium- and long-term and
hence its contribution to the Mauritanian economy. The rehabilitation
program is at the core of the proposed Rehabilitation Project for the
financing of which SNIM has requested assistance from the Bank and the
other colenders of the Guelbs Project.
II. THE MAURITANIAN MINING SECTOR
A. Role of Mining Sector in the E-onomy
2.01      Despite the recent development of the fisheries sector, mining
continues to be the most important sector of the Mauritanian economy. The
mining sector consists almost exclusively of the exploitation of iron ore,
which dates back to 1963, when Mines de Fer de Mauritanie (MIFERMA), the
predecessor of SNIM, commenced operations. From the beginning, production
capacity has increased from 6 million tpy to about 11.5 million tpy. The
most recent expansion was the Guelbs mine project that started production
in March 1985. The operations are located inland at Zouerate, about 650 km
east northeast of Nouadhibou, the port of shipment, which is connected with
Zouerate by a company-owned railway.
2 .02     Iron ore mining has been a mainstay of the Mauritanian economy,
and its development has been the chief determinant of the country's
economic growth. The two tables belov illustrate the role of the mining
sector in terms of its share in GDP and merchandise exports.

2.03      While still a very Important sector in the Mauritanian economy,
the mining sector's direct contribution to GDP has fallen from 13.9% in
1975 to 9.2% in 1983, partly due to declining iron ore output and partly
due to growth in other sectors, in particular the fisheries sector which



-3-
increased its contribution to GDP at market prices from 3.6% in 1975 to
7.7% in 1983. Also, government services and trarsport and commnmications
have grown relative to other sectors in the period 1975-1983. However, in
addition to its direct contribution to GDP, iron ore mining has some
indirect impact on GDP through value-added in the industrial, construction
and services sectors.

2.04     Foreign excchange generation, rather than financial return on the
investment, was the principal argument for the Guelbs project. Local labor
is the only source of local value-added and amounts to about 40-45% of
total costs of operation. Since the initiation of the Guelbs project in
the mid-1970s, the fisheries sector has grown substantially, and iron ore
export is no longer the almost exclusive source of foreign exchange for
Mauritania. The iron ore sector's share in merchandise exports fell from
862 in 1975 to 42% in 1983, basically due to the growth of the fisheries
sector. Local value-added in the fisheries sector has been estimated at
approximately 55-60% of gross earnings. Mauritania's dependence on iron
ore exports for foreign exchange generation is projected to be further
lessened in the future due to the Government's policy in the fisheries
sector of gradual replacement of foreign licensing agreem-ents with
Mauritanian-controlled joint venture companies.
2.05      SNIM contributes to public revenue directly through the payment
of a 10Z royalty on all iron ore export sales and indirectly through the
tax payments of its about 6,100 employees. In 1984, the royalty alone
amounted to US$13.8 million, or 8Z of total public revenue.
B.  Mineral Resources and Reserves
1.   Iron Ore
2.06      The presently mined iron ore deposits are located in the Kedia
mountains near Zouerate (Map IBRD 19049). Two different ore grades are
available at Kedia: (i) high grade ore (iron content 62-64% Fe, silica
content 4-8% SiO2); and (ii) low grade (siliceous) ore (50-55Z Fe, 12-16%
SiO2). Both qualities are mainly sold as sinterfeed; only a small portion



-4-
is recoverable as lumpy ore. Other than crushing and screening, the ore
does not require further treatment. The reserves of high grade ore
presently remaining in the Kedia mountains are only in the order of 30
million tonnes. The reserves of siliceous ore are larger; however, over
the last few years, SNIM has not been able to extend the share of siliceous
ore in its exports beyond 20-25%. The market restrictions for siliceous
ore are expected to persist in the future. In the past, siliceous ore bas
been mined as a by-product of high grade ore: it forms part of the
overburden which has to be removed to get access to the rich ore. Mining
of the low priced siliceous ore on its own, without the benefit of
co-production with high grade ore, would probably not be economical. Thus,
the limiting factor for the expected life of the Kedia mines is
availability of the high grade ore. Assuming in the future an average
yearly extractiot of about 3 million tonnes of high grade ore, the reserves
would last until about 1995.
2.07      As the Kedia mines are being depleted, an increasing amount of
Guelbs ore will be mined. The raw, untreated Guelbs ore has an iron
content of only 38% Fe. Upgrading through magnetic separation is required
to achieve a marketable product of 64% Fe. All Guelbs products will be
sinterfeed of only one single grain size class marketed in two varieties:
(i) ore with a high magnetite content (18% Fe+4); and (ii) ore with a low
magnetite content (6% Fe++). The Guelbs feasibility study defined about
350 million tonnes of raw ore reserves at Guelb El Rhein and about 100
million tonnes at Guelb Oum Arwagen. However, the unfavorable development
of iron ore prices necessitates a reassessment of economical reserves.
Bank staff recently estimated that only about 50-60% of the reserves may be
economically recoverable at present ore prices. Since about 2.3 tonnes of
raw ore are needed to produce 1 tonne of product, the economical reserves
would allow an operation of the existing Guelbs plant (6 million tpy
capacity) over a period of 18 years. Under the assumption of continuing
low iron ore prices, there would be no reserve base for a phase 2 Guelbs
plant.
2.08      Ore from other known iron deposits near Zouerate would be of
lower grade, or, more importantly, of finer grain size than the Guelbs ore
and its upgrading would necessitate fine grinding with subsequent
pelletizing, a non-economical process for a country without cheap energy
sources. This would also apply to the large, low grade Thasiast deposit,
located about 200 km east of Nouadhibou, close to the existing rail link
between Zouerate and Nouadhibou.
2.  Other Minerals
2.09      The relatively small, mediuw grade Akjoujt copper deposit,
located about 200 km northeast of Nouakchott, was mined by S'nciftg des
Mines de Mauritanie (SOMINA) in two short periods: from 1971 to 1974 and
from 1975 to 1978. 3/ Operations were stopped in 1974 after a decline of

amount of approximately US$20.0 million. IFC has since sold its shares
in the company.

copper prices and the steep increase in fuel prices connected with the
first oil shock. To maintain employment, the Government of Mauritania took
over the company, integrated it with SNIM, and operations resumed in 1975.
Due to continuous high losses and their serious impact on SNIM's financial
situation, the operations were shut down in 1978. Market and prices for
zopper deteriorated further, and the outlook for a successful reopening of
the mine is bleak. In addition, a relatively high arsenic content of the
ore makes its marketing difficult.
2.10      Gypsum from an area north of Nouakchott has been mined since
1973 by SNIM. In 1983, this operation was separated from ShN?. The output
is small (17,000 tpy) and entirely sold to the Rufisque cement plant in
Senegal in return for a rebate on cement sold to Mauritania. Even before
the start of gypsum exploitation, some small sulfur nodules had been found
in the gypsum strata. Exploration work in 1947 by Bureau de Recherches
Ggologiques et Minieres (BRGM) demonstrated that the existence of
economically recoverable reserves could be precluded. Nevertheless, due to
the present high sulfur prices, the Senegalese phosphate fertilizer
industry has recently shown an interest to review exploration results.
2.11      Other minerals, which are not mined but have been reported
existing in Mauritania, include phosphate, rare earth and gold. About 90
million tonnes of raw phosphate rock have been identified near the Senegal
river, some 300 km from the sea. The market situation, the relatively low
reserves and the lack of transport infrastructure preclude an economical
exploitation for the time being. Similarly, market considerations, remote
desert lcation and poor geological indications do not suggest any
possibility of economical exploitation of rare earths or gold.
III. THE COMPANY
3.01      Since the nationalization of NIFERMA in 1974, the Mauritanian
iron ore mines have been operated by Societe Nationale Industrielle et
Miniere (SNIM), established as a State company in 1972. In 1978, SNIM was
made a state-controlled, limited liability corporation (Societe d'Economie
Mixte a Majorite d'Etat), permitting private and foreign ownership. SNIM's
share capital is currently held by the Mauritanian government (70.9%),
Kuwait Foreign Trading Contracting and Investment Company (9.6%), Arab
Mining Company (7.6Z), Iraq Fund for External Development (6.2%), Bureau de
Recherches et de Participations Mini4res of Morocco (3.1Z), Islamic
Development Bank (2.4%) and Mauritanian individuals (0.2%). The
shareholders are represented in the Board of Directors which is chaired by
a Mauritanian official designated by the Government.
3.02      Apart from the iron ore mining operation (SNIM Fer), SNIM
includes a few minor ventures:
(i) SNIM Explosifs, a small expl--qives factory entirely captive to
the iron ore mine which is ncw being made redundant through the
introduction of modern ANFO explosives mixing trucks and will
therefore be discontinued;



-6-
(ii)  SNIM Acier, a small steel plant producing steel bars used in
construction mainly for the local market; this operation has so
far made cash losses. The majority of the shares in this company
has been sold to the Arab Mining Company and Bahrein shareholders
in July 1984. Without any new cash contribution from SNIM, a new
company, Soci t Arabe du Fer et de l'Acier (SAFA) was formed, in
which SNIM holds 33% shares. The steel plant has been legally,
financially and administratively separated from SNIN; any
remaining operational and commercial links between SAFA and SNIN
are at arms' length; and
(iii) SNIM Paris, the marketing branch located in Paris.
A.   Organization and Management
3.03      SNIM's organization chart is presented in Annex 3-1.  The Board
of Directors has delegated all powers and authority for managing the
operations to the General Manager. The Company started a reorganization in
1984. Previously a flat structure (22 departmental managers reporting
directly to the general manager), the organization has since late 1984 a
more traditional pyramid shape (10 managers reporting to the general
manager, each with three to seven divisional managers reporting to them).
The new general manager, appointed in February 1985, was the mine mansger
at Zouerate. He has an appropriate background and experience for
implementing manageme.at, production and cost improvements. A review of the
management and organizational structure by consultants CEGOS/METCHEM of
France/Canada, whose terms of reference were reviewed by the Bank,
confirmed that the new overall organizational structure of SNIM is
adequate.
3.04      From 1979 to 1984, SNIM's work-force increased by about 17%, or
1,000 persons. This strong growth in the work-force is a major reason for
the company's present financial difficulties and will be addressed in the
proposed Project (para. 5.17). On the other hand, SNIM has achieved a
reduction in the amount of expatriates, from about 400, or 8% of the
workforce in 1979, to about 100, or 2%, in 1984.

B.   Operations
3.05      SNIN's headquarters are located at Nouadhibou, the port of ore
shipments. The iron ore operations are managed from Zouerate; the port and
railway operations from Nouadhibou. SNIM also maintains (i) a small office
in Nouakchott for liaison with the Government; and (ii) since 1984, a small
purchase office in Las Palmas which has become SNIM's main solrce for food
and small supplies. Despite the large labor force, SNIM's operations are
reasonably efficient and equipment maintenance is in general appropriate.
3.06      The Kedia mining operations are spread over six small pits with
two crushing and train loading stations, one at Rouessa and one at Tazadit,
each having a capacity of about 5 million tpy. The mines are equipped with
older 4m3-electric rope shovels and tnrcks of varying size, predominantly
in the 60-tonne class. The equipment, large in number and of advanced age,
needs continuous planned maintenance and overhaul for its efficient
operation. The ore is trucked over an average distance of about 3 km to
the primary crushers at Rouessa and Tazadat. Full secondary a>.' tertiary
crushing and screening is done at Rouessa; ore from Tazadit undergoes
secondary crushing and screening only at the port in Nouadhibou. Overhauls
of the ore handling facilities at Zouerate are essential for securing
sufficient production capacity over the medium-term. Service stations for
mining equipment are located near the two primary crushers. The central
workshops, mechanical and electrical, are located in Zouerate along with
other services, such as power and water supply and warehousing. The town
of Zouerate now has about 50,000 inhabitants, of which about 2,500 are
employed in SNIM's Zouerate operations. All inhabitants depend on SNIM's
operations for a livelihood. Although major services for the township,
such as schools, hospitals, food distribution and airport operation have to
a large extent been transferred to Government agencies or private
enterprises, SNIM is still responsible for power and water supply to the
town of Zouerate, as well as for major road maintenance. By the end of
1986, SNIM will decide on further cost saving measures in this area.
3.07      The railway connects over a distance of about 650 km Zouerate
with the port at Nouadhibou. Although SNIM has regularly maintained the
railway track, some of its sections are now so heavily worn that
replacement becomes critical to sustain present production levels. Some of
the locomotives are worn out and need either new engines or complete
replacements. The port equipment, consisting of ore tipping, crushing,
screening, stockpiling and shiploading facilities, is basically in good
operating condition; only the shiploader requires an overhaul in the near
future to secure high availability.
3.08      In view of the depletimg ore reserves at Kedia, exploration
drilling for other ore reserves was already started under MIFERMA. The
drilling, together with subsequent pilot plant testing, engineering and
design work, led to the definition of the Guelbs project. The first phase
consisted of a beneficiation plant of 6 million tpy capacity and a mine at
El Rhein; in the second prhase the beneficiation plant was to be doubled in



-8-
size and a mine at Oum Arwagen was to be added. Financing for the first
phase from 12 lenders, including the Bank, was obtained in 1978, and the
first contracts for the project were issued in 1979. After initial delays
caused by late effectiveness of the loans and procurement inefficiencies,
construction was completed end 1984 at a cost of $350.0 million, about 20Z
lower than estimated at appraisal, mainly due to the lower than expected
inflation and the highly competitive bid prices obtained. The first
beneficiated ore was shipped in March 1985. Apart from the initial delays
and except for the remaining problems with the running-in of the
beneficiation plant (para. 3.10), the project was implemented
satisfactorily from a technical, financial and managerial point of view.
3.09      The Guelbs pinject consists of a new mine at the Guelb (mountain)
El Rhein, about 30 km north of Zouerate, a beneficiation plant and some
extension of the existing railway and port. Mine and beneficiation plant
are modern and well designed. The mine is equipped with efficient, large
equipment: 4 shovels (12m3 capacity), 14 trucks (100 tonnes capacity) and
3 drills for blastholes of 9" diameter. The beneficiation plant is the key
component of the project. Due to lack of water, a completely dry
semi-autogenous grinding process followed by dry magnetic separation was
selected. The plant consists of two production lines, each of 3 million
tpy capacity. Provisions have been made for a possible later addition of
another two lines. A new 60 MW diesel power station has been added. The
existing railway has been extended to join the Guelbs site. Some rolling
stock has been added and port facilities have been slightly extended to
accommodate the Guelbs ore.
3.10      Presently, the Guelbs benefication plant is operating at 2
shifts/day and 5 days/week. The output for 1985 is estimated at about
1.0-1.5 million tonnes. SNIM plans to increase the production over the
next two years to 4.5 million tpy (75% of capazity) and accordingly
decrease the production from Kedia. Although all major operating
parameters have been verified to range within design limits and previously
estimated production cost elements have been confirmed so far, SWIM has
experienced during start-up some technical problems, in particular with the
control of dust from the totally dry process. The plant designer
(SOCOMINE), a FLe!nch steel company (SOLMER), the French steel industry;s
consulting branch (SOFRESID) and various equipment suppliers all provide
technical assistance for the start-up. Based on the experience gained
during the first six months of operation, SNIM has prepared a detailed plan
for improvements and has created a task force to solve technical problems.
These measures are considered appropriate.
C.   Past Production and Sales Performance and Recent Financial Position
3.11      With production and sales of 9.5 million tonnes, SNIM managed in
1984 to reverse a trend of declining production and sales from 11.7 million
tonnes in 1974 to 7.4 million tonnes in 1983. The recent increase was
primarily due to sales to Italy, Belgium and the UK, where SNIM's share of
imports increased from 1982 to 1984 by 5%, 4%, and 2%, respectively.

3.12      The develooment of SNIN's iron ore sales and unit production cost
is shown in the table below:
Sales Volume, Iron Ore Prices, and Unit Production Costs, 1980-84

Source: SNIM.
Whereas SNIM's average iron ore price in US dollar terms declined,
production cost in US dollar terms remained about the same until 1984.
In 1984, the ouguiya was devalued by about 20%, and in addition production
volume increased. SNIM managed to benefit from both these events and
avoided any slippage in production costs. As a result, unit costs declined
by 16% in US dollar terms and by 2% in ouguiya terms. The share of labor
costs in total costs, which essentially represent the local cost component,
reached 46% in 1983. The 1984 devfiluation led to a remarkable decrease in
labor cost and a drop in its share to 42%; this illustrates the importance
of the newly adopted flexible exchange rate regime for SNIM's future
inteLnational competitiveness.
3.13      Present total unit production cost, including interest and
depreciation, amount to US$12.6/t. They do not yet take into account the
increases caused by the Guelbs Project. Presently, direct operating cost
for mine, railway and port represent about 70% of the total operating cost,
leaving a relatively large balance of 30% of overheads.
3.14      SNIM's financial position for the years 1981-1984 is summarized
below. Annex 3-2 provides details of the financial situation for the years
1981-1984.

In 1984, SNIM managed to put an end to declining sales, revenue and
income. Sales revenues were 34% higher than the 1983 level, achieved by
increased sales, despite lower average iron ore prices. The production
cost reduction in 1984, mentioned above (para. 3.12), resulted in a marked
improvement in operating income from 2.7% of total revenue in 1983 to 12.7%
in 1984. The internally generated cash position also Improved in 1984, but
SNIK faced heavy outlays: (i) SNIM invested a significant amount and mre
than it drew down colenders' loans; (ii) the royalty paid by SNIM to the
Government, which was 6% of total sales during the Guelbs project
implementation, returned to 10% upon the completion of the Guelbs project
and amounted in 1984 to about 40% of self-generated cash. As a result,
SNIM incurred additional short-term debt, and total current liabilities,
relative to total sales, increased from 14% in 1983 to 19% in 1984. The
current ratio, still above 1.0 in 1982 and 1983, dropped to 0.9 in 1984,
implying that SNIM is in default of the financial covenant of the Guelbs
loan, stipulating a current ratio of at least 1.3.



-11-
3.15      Whereas SNIM dfd not pay dividends in the period 1981-1984, its
direct contribution to the Government revenues in the form of royalty
payments amounted to UH 2.2 billion (US$39.6 million), and, in the same
period, SNID paid approximately UM 11.8 billion (US$216.5 million) in
wages.
D.   SNDM's Medium- and Long-Term Outlook
3.16      Starting 1985, SNIM will over the medium-term operate its
traditional Kedia operations and the new Guelbs plant in parallel. Ore
sales are expected to amount to 9-10 million tpy, of which the Guelbs
plant, after the initial start-up period, would produce up to 6 million
tpy, the remainder of 3 to 4 million tpy being produced as high grade and
siliceous ore by the Kedia mines. Due to the low grade and the resulting
high mining volume and beneficiation costs, the Guelbs project leads to
higher production costs as shown below.

a/ High grade ore only.
b/ Cash operating costs only, excluding overheads.
Sources: SNIM and Bank staff estimates.
The difference in operating costs between Guelbs and Kedia of US$4.2/t
means an increase of SNIM's overall cash production cost (including
depreciation) from US$12.6/t to about US$15.0/t, or by 20Z, once the Guelbs
plant is in full operation and then accounting for about 60% of SNIM's
production. In addition, SNIM will, during this period, have to serve the
Guelbs debt with about US$3.5/t initially, and US$1.5/t in 1995.
3.17      After depletion of the Kedia mines, estimated to occur around
1995, and given the economic ore reserves (para. 2.07), the implementation
of the second phase of the Guelbe project does not seem a viable option at
present. SNIH's production and sales volume would then decrease.



-12-
Dependiag on the amount of siliceous ore SNIM could produce and sell at
that time from Guelbs, the drop in production may be in the order of 20%,
so that the long-term production rate may be about 7-8 million tpy. The
combined effect of lack of low cost ore from Kedia and lower production
would be an increase in production cost in the order of 30%. Possibly
about half of this increase could oe compensated by further drastic
adjustment of production and overhead cost beyond the cost cutting measures
of the proposed Project. Considering that presently SNIM's unit cash
production cost are still well below the iron ore price and most of the
Guelbs debt will have been repaid after the depletion of Kedia, a
financially viable operation appears still possible at that time.
IV. THE IRON ORE MARXET
4.01      The international iron ore market is the major external
determinant for SNIM's financial viability and for the value of SNIM to the
Mauritanian economy. The uncertainty of this market is a major source of
financial risk for SNIM and the proposed Project. This chapter summarizes
recent market developments and presents the Bank's price projections, as
well as an assessment of SNIM's market position. A more detailed
discussion of the iron ore market is presented in Annex 4-1.
A.   Demand and Supply of Iron Ore4/
4.02      An estimated 98% of iron ore is used in the steel industry.
Consequently, the demand for iron ore is directly derived from the steel
market.
4.03      Demand for Crude Steel.  The character of the international steel
market has changed markedly in the past two decades. During the 1960s,
world steel consumption grew strongly at an average rate of 5.5% per year.
In the 1970s, the annual average steel growth rate declined to 1.9%. From
1980 to 1983, the world steel market experienced the severest reversal in
decades, with consumption declining from 712 million tonnes in 1980 to 668
million tonnes in 1983. Steel consumption in industrialized countries is
expected to show only minor growth in the next decade or so. However, for
developing countries, especially the larger LDCs, substantial growth in
steel consumption is expected in the next decade because these countries
are developing their basic industries and infrastructure, as well as
housing and capital stock. Estimates indicate that world steel production
and consumption would increase from about 710 million tonnes in 1980 to
somewhere in the range of 760 to 880 million tonnes by 1995. For
industrialized and developing countries, production and consumption would
increase from about 510 million tonnes in 1980 to 540-640 million tonnes by
1995. The remainder of the increase, about 30 million tonnes, would be
accounted for by centrally planned economies.

Industry Prospects 1985-95."

4.04      Demand for Iron Ore.  The liternarional Iron ore market has
contracted severely in the face of the atee  m.arvet collapse.  Steel
companies have traditionally viewed security of supply and stable prices of
their raw materials as a critical requirement for their long-term
viability and therefore own mines or have long-term ore purchase
arrangements. Recently, Japanese and European mills have developed major
interests in Brazilian iron ore operations. In addition, the mines produce
different products, namely, lumpy ore, sicterfeed and pellets. Long-term
sales arrangements reflect a matching of the ;,eel mills' requirements with
particular grades and types of ore available at specific mines.
4.05      For the future, growth in iron ore requirements will come from
steel mills in developing countries. Whereso in induatrialized countries
iron ore requirements of steel producers are c.cpected to remain below the
level of the early 1980s, in developing countries they are projected to
increase from about 180 million tonnes average in 1980-83 to 250 to 290
million tonnes in 1995.
4.06      Supply of Iron Ore.  World production of iron ore peaked at 903
million tonnes in 1975 and fluctuated between about 850 and 900 million
tonnes from 1976 to 1981. In 1982 and 1983, production collapsed to 777
and 746 million tonnes, respectively, in tbe face of large inventory
overhangs and sharp cutbacks in offtake by steel mills of a previously
unprecedented nature. Major producing regions are the US (Mlnnesota),
Canada (Quebec-Labrador), Australia (Northwest), Brazil and West Africa
(Mauritania-Liberia) who account for about two thirds of market economies'
production. Cutbacks have been most severe In industrialized countries
where 1983 production was at 190 million tonnes compared to 337 million
tonnes in 1975. However, developing countries' producers have also faced
cutbacks from 324 million tonn6s in 1975 to Z .illion tonnes in 1983.
4.07      There is presently substantial excess world iron ore production
capacity. Current market economy production capacity is estimated at 556
million tpy compared with a production of about 41' r.'2.lion tpy in 1983.
From 1985 to 1990, production capacity is expecte. co increase by about 15
million tpy, allowing for capacity additions from new projects in Brazil,
India and Iran, while mines may be closed in the US, France and Liberia.
Thereafter, from 1990 to 1995 closures of about 20 million tpy capacity
are expected as mines are del .eted In Australia, the US, Canada and
Liberia.
4.08      Seaborne Iron Ore Market.  Internativ-:al trade in iron ore
reached a peak of about 400 million tonnes iln 979 and declined to about
300 million tonnes in 1983. The major international seaborne trade in Iron
ore is from Brazil and Australia to Japan and Europe. Smaller but
significant exporters include India (about 25 million tpy) and South
Africa, Liberia, Canada, Sweden and Venezuela (about 10-20 million tpy
each). Future market projections indicate poor growth for seaborne iron



-14-
ore trade with total requirements expected to increase from about 295
million tonnes in 1985 to 300 to 390 million tonnes in 1995. For
industrialized countries, growth in requirements will 'Se minimal. For
developing countries, iron ore requirements are expected to increase from
37 million tonnes in 1985 to between 55 and 85 million tonnes in 1995. The
Republic of Korea accounts for 28% of the incremental requirements, and
China for 17%.
B.   Iron Ore Prices
4.09      There are two distinct price structures in the world.  North
Aiaerica comprises one pricing area, while the rest of the market economies
forms the other. North American mines are largely captive to steel
mills, and prices are generally determined by production costs. They are
higher than the prices elsewhere, which are determined by market forces.
Most ores are priced in US dollars and on an FOB basis.
4.10      International iron ore prices from 1960-84 and forecast for
1985-95, as exemplified by Brazilian sinterfeed prices cif Europe, are
shown in the graph on the following page, both, in US dollars from
1960-1984, and in DM from 1975-1984. In constant US dollar terms, iron ore
prices declined steadily by 62% between 1960 and 1978, but remained
relatively unchanged between 1978 and 1983. However, due to the
strengthening of the US dollar as from 1981, the iron ore price increased
in terms of currencies not tied to the US dollar. As an example, the price
of iron ore in real DM terms increased by 18% in the period 1980 to 1984.
Iron ore producers benefited from these market conditions to the extent
that their costs are incurred in currencies not tied to the dollar.
Brazil, Australia and other major producers clearly benefited on this
account due to a high local content in their cost of production. In
Mauritania, however, the local currency was, until early 1984, essentially
tied to the US dollar; since February 1985, the Government has followed a
flexible exchange rate policy.
4.11      Total production costs and returns on equity for existing
efficient mining operations are important yardsticks for future price
levels as iron ore sales prices generally will allow reasonable returns to
efficient producers over the longer term. Australian and Brazilian ore
exports have played an increasingly important role in the European and
world markets, and are expected to remain the dominant and price
determining forces in the world iron ore market. Apart from having
benefited from the above-mentioned iron ore price increases in real local
currency terms, their infrastructure is well developed, and existing iron
ore operations are profitable. This, together with the continuing excess
supply situation, implies that iron ore prices in real terms are unlikely
to increase over the medium- to long-term.
4.12      The Bank's iron ore price projections are shown below. With
slight fluctuations during the period, the price of iion ore in real terms
is projected to decrease by 8% in the period 1985-1995.

C.   SNIM's Market Position
4.13      SNIM's major markets in 1984 were Italy (accounting for 31% of
the Company's sales), France (23Z), Belgium (23%), the United Kingdom (11%)
and Germany (&6). SNIM exports are concentrated (77% of total sales), in
three countries - Italy, France and Belgium - where its market share
reaches around 15%; SNIM has only little (1%) market penetration in
Germany, which is the major European market for imported iron ore (40% of
the imports of rhe five previously mentioned countries). SNIM's recent
export performance has been acceptable. Even at a time when European iron
ore markets were particularly depressed, SNIM has consistently captured
about 7% of the European seaborne iron ore market, gaining in Italy and
Belgium what it lost in Germany and the UK (it increased significantly its
share of Italy's and Belgium's markets in 1984 with sales of siliceous
ore). Furthermure, SNIM also opened new markets for its ore in developing
countries by starting exports to Tunisia, Turkey and Yugoslavia. The
quantities involved, however, are small.
4.14      It does not appear easy for SNIM to improve its market position
since:
(i)  its ore (including the Guelbs ore, a new product on which it will
soon have to rely for the bulk of its sales and for which it has
yet to secure market outlets) contains comparatively high levels
of silica, which some modern steel mills regard as a penalty,
although the ore could suitably be used for blending with low
silica ore, which would be increasingly available after start-up
of the Brazilian Carajas project;
(ii)  Germany is likely to fulfill its import requirements from Bong
(Liberia) and Ferteco (Brazil) where it has equity interests, as
well as from Canadian companies, and Compania do Vale de Rio Doce
(CVRD) (Brazil), with high quality low silica, natural ore, in an
increasing amount from the new Carajas project; and
(iii)  supp2ies to developing countries around the Mediterranean
(Tunisia, Turkey and Yugoslavia) are expected to remain low, due
to slow economic growth and efforts to use local raw materials.
For supplics to the faster growing Asian developing countries,
SNIM's geographical position is unfavorable.
Therefore, it appears unlikely that SNIM could, over the long-term,
significantly increase its sales above the 9-10 million tonnes level
reached in 1984.
4.15      On the other hand, and as discussed above, SNIM's share of the
total European market is relatively small at 7%, and its Guelbs sales are
basically to replace some of its existing Kedia sales. Also, European
steel mills may wish to retain supply capabilities in West Africa to avoid
concentrating their supply sources in Brazil and Australia. To the extent



-17-
that reserves are being depleted in Liberia and that prospects are not
favorable for any new iron ore projects in Africa adding substantial new
capacity in the near/medium-ters, SNIM should be able to maintain its sales
level in the European iron ore market. SNIM's good recent marketing
performance also supports this assumption.
V. THE REHABILITATION PROJECT
A.   Background and Bank's Role
5.01      Since 1981, Bank staff have during supervision of the Guelbs
Project projected a serious future cash deficit of the Company, if no
remedial action would be taken. The cash deficit would be caused mainly by
low iron ore prices and increased production cost and debt service payments
due to the Guelbs Project. At SNIM's initiative, meetings with the Guelbs
colenders were held to explore possibilities for financial assistance.
After SNID declared its intention to start a full rehabilitation program,
Arab colenders agreed to making available unused portions of their Guelbs
loans and reschedule loan repayments. The CCCE uade a new loan available
for technical assistance for the Guelbs start-up. The Bank considered a
new loan, provided SNIM made progress in implementation and further
definition of its rehabilitation program.
5.02      In 1984, SNIM's management embarked on a rehabilitation program
affecting most of the Company in the areas of technical and financial
management, organizational structure, and personnel policy. Certain
results have already been achieved, such as the organizational change, the
slow-down in recruiting and some cost savings. The proposed Project will
continue these efforts, consolidate the positive results already achieved
and kurther integrate new technical and financial managerial practices.
The Project includes the purchase of critical equipment, as well as
training and technical assistance, necessary for the implementation of the
rehabilitation program.
5.03      The Project fits well into the Bank's lending strategy for
Mauritania and the West African region, aiming at creating economies which
do not depend on continued external financial assistance. SNIM is a major
asset of the Mauritanian economy with considerable positive macroeconomical
impact and its technical and financial viability is crucial. The scope for
improvements exists, and SNIM and the Government started taking actions.
The Bank's support for these efforts helps focussing on priority actions
and implementing them in a timely manner. The Bank's support is also
welcomed by the colenders who recognize the benefit of the Bank's
leadership in this connection.
B.  Project Objectives
5.04      SNIM's rehabilitation program, along with necessary expenditures
for equipment replacements and measures to improve efficiency of
operations, have the overall objective to secure in the medium-term



-18-
financial viability of the Company and its contributions to the Mauritanian
economy. Generally, adverse market conditions and SNIM's particularly
difficult market position underscore the importance of SNIM's strong
sustained efforts to remain a source of economic benefits to the
Mauritanian economy in addition to staying a financially viable operation.
5.05      The Project consolidates and further advances the ongojug action
program for managerial and technical improvements during the years
1986-1988 and in particular will:
(i) help SNIM continue to improve its management and reduce its
production costs; and
(ii)  assist with the necessary financial restructuring of SNIM by
transforming part of its short-term debt/overdrafts into
long-term debt.
C. The Rehabilitation Program (1984-88)
5.06      The Program, of which the Project forms part, consists of a
series of measures by SNIM a'med at improvements and cost reductions in the
following areas: (i) manageiaent; (ii) operations; (iii) procurement and
investments; (iv) personnel; (v) overhead cost; and (vi) cash management.
In almost all of these areas, SNIM has started to implement improvements
since 1984. As part of the proposed Project, further actions are planned
from January 1986 to mid-1988. Major actions in each of the above areas
are described below. A detailed list of the actions already completed and
the actions planned is presented on the following two pages.
1.  Management and Organization Improvements
5.07      The management and organization improvements concern the
organizational structure, planning and information/control systems.
5.08      Organizational Structure:  SNIM has started to simplify and
improve the Company's structure and better define responsibility, authority
and accountability of managers. To this end, SNIM also completed a study
by a management consultant/mining firm (CEGOS/METCREM).  The study was
financed by the Kuwait Fund as part of the Project. Terms of reference
were reviewed by the Bank. The study concluded that SNIM's new overall
organizational structure is adequate. A few minor measures for additional
cost savings were indicated which SNIM will implement as part of the
rehabilitation program.
5.09      Planning:  In view of the expected depletion of the Kedia
reserves over the next 10 years and the consequent extra need for careful
financial planning, SNIM has introduced 10-year financial projections and
started to work on a detailed 5-year production/investment plan. The
10-year financial projections are being reviewed and updated annually. The
first 5-year production/investment plan is expected to be completed by the
end of 1985. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that this plan
be reviewed annually and a copy submitted to the Bank for approval (para.
7.10).

5.10      Information/Control Systems:  The following systems are being
improved: cost accounting, reporting, operating norms and budget control.
A new cost accounting system was introduced on a trial basis in January
1985.  Emphasis is now on the introduction of a new budget control system
linked with the new cost accounting system. To this end, SNIM started to
define operating norms. The Bank reviewed SNIM's operations efficiency and
budget review procedures, including the format of reports it wants to use
in the future, and found them satisfactory. As part of the reporting
requirements, SNIM will submit to the Bank, not later than 8 weeks after
each quarter, starting May 31, 1986, minutes of quarterly budget and
operations efficiency review meetings (para. 7.11).
2.   Operations and Maintenance Improvements
5.11      The operations and maintenance improvements extend to mining
activities, port and railway, and to the control of spare parts.
5.12      Mining and Ore Beneficiation:  The following areas are being
emphasized: (i) planned overhauls of fixed installatl3ns; (ii) close
control of the number of mobile mining equipment in use; (iii) the
elimination of old and redundant equipment; and (iv) proper maintenance and
carefully planned overhauls of the equipluent. SNIK has presented to the
Bank a satisfactory list of the equipment to be overhauled in 1986 and
1987. Under the proposed Project, an adequate level of tools, control
equipment and operating supplies will be provided. Switchirg to new engine
coolers and longer oil change intervals may also contribute to cost
reductions. Better mine planning, improvements in drilling, blasting and
truck dispatch, and the introduction of a third working shift per day are
further areas leading to cost reductions. The CEGOS/METCHEM study
indicated a few minor additional cost saving measures. Sound technical
control of the Guelbs plant during its start-up period is essential for
SNIM's cost efficiency. To this end, SNIM has contracted adequate
technical assistance. Failure to each production at full capacity of the
plant within a reasonable time period would require a complete reevaluation
of the medium-term prospects of SNIM. To avoid delays during plant-
starr-up, SNIM has prepared a plan for technical improvements, mainly
covering the period October 1-December 31, 1985. This plan will be updated
every month until end 1986. Furthermore, SNIM has installed a task force
to solve technical problems. Composition of the task force, its
objectives, working methods and authority have been reviewed by the Bank
and were found satisfactory. With these measures, it is expected thaL
during the first half of 1987, the plant will be producing at a rate of not
less than 4 million tpy. Before June 30, 1987, SNIM will prepare plans and
targets, acceptable to the Bank, for the plant production and technical
assistance duriag the following 12 months.
5.13      Railways and Ports:   SNIM is concentrating on the improvement of
the maintenance of locomotives and wagons. Technical assistance from CANAC
and SOFRERAIL has started. Other improvements to be implemented in 1986
are a better communication system on moving trains aad shorter shiploading
times through higher speed of loading conveyors.



-22-
5.14      Spare Parts Control:  SNIM is aware of the potentially large cost
savings that can be realized through efficient spare parts management and
has started a program of improvements involving computerization of stock
level control, identification and elimination of dead stocks, and a
redefinition of responsibilities for staff in the warehouses. The proposed
Bank loan will finance about 20 man-months of consultant services in this
area. Terms of reference and a timetable for the consultant services have
been agreed at negotiations. Before June 30, 1987, SNIM will prepare plans
and targets, acceptable to the Bank, for further improvements in spare
parts management.
3.   Procurement and Investment Policies
5.15      Procurement:  In 1984, SNIM launched the following improvements:
consolidation of procurement and purchasing departments, greater recourse
to international competition of suppliers, creation of a purchase control
commission, increase of technical staff, more direct purchases from
manufacturers without dealers, and computerization of procurement
functions. By June 30, 1987, SNIM will prepare plans, acceptable to the
Bank, for further improvements in this area.
5.16      Investments:  SNIM has adopted a policy to restrict investments
to the absolute minimum. There are presently no new investments planned.
Only replacement investments will be made, of which the largest are for the
renewal of railway track sections and some mobile mining equipment.
Assurances were obtained during negotiations, that SNIM's annual renewal
and new investments budget, i.e., additional to the completion of the
Guelbs Project and the rehabilitation program, not exceed US$4.0 million,
without prior agreement of the Bank during the project implementation
period. Thereafter, SNIM will not incur total annual investments exceeding
US$5.5 million without prior consultation of the Bank.
4.   Personnel Policy
5.17      SNIM has reduced recruitment and overtime hours worked.  A study
of staff reallocation has been started. Bank staff previously conclusded
that, technically, personnel cost could be lowered by at least 20%, through
reduction of personnel and overtime only. SNIM has provided the Bank with
acceptable plans and targets for reduction of personnel and reduction of
overtime in 1986. The achievement of these targets will be closely
monitored. Before June 30, 1987, SNIM will: (i) prepare plans and
targets, acceptable to the Bank, for further reductions of personnel and
overtime in the following 12 months; (ii) submit to the Bank its 5-year
policy for salary level and structure; and (iii) in line with tte new
policy, prepare plans and targets, acceptable to the Bank, for level and
structure of salaries during the first 12 months.
5.   Overhead Cost Reduction
5.18      SNIM has started to reduce costs by (i) cutting its expenses for
company offices in Paris, Las Palmas and Nouakchott; (ii' reducing its
involvement in non-iron ore mining activities such as the steel mill,



-23-
explosives manufacturing and R & D work for other mineral projects, and
(iii) reducing expenses for general training and transport. SNIM has
submitted acceptable draft terms of reference and a timetable for a study
of further overhead cost reduction measures to the Bank. After completion
of the study, but before June 30, 1987, SNIM will prepare plans and
targets, acceptable to the Bank, for further reductions.
6.   Cash Management Improvements
5.19      SNIM presently has almost fully utilized the lines of credit
available to the Company. To improve day to day cash management,
accounting and treasury operations will be strengthened. In the short run,
the improvements will include the removal of procedural bottlenecks for the
recording of incoming invoices and similar documents; preparation of
monthly synthetical reports on the state of loans and of free cash; and the
organization of the monthly closure of accounts in a detailed calendar.
Better cash management will reduce the Company's dependence on short-term
credit. At the end of 1S84, SNIM's bank overdrafts amounted to about
US$15.0 million. In 1985, SNIM started slowly reducing the overdrafts.
The short-term target is to reduce before June 30, 1987, bank overdrafts by
at least US$5.0 million from their level on December 31, 1985. Thereafter,
bank overdrafts should not exceed US$8.0 million.
D. Description of Project Components to be Financed
5.20      The proposed loan, together with funds from colenders and SNTM's
internal cash generation, will finance the purchases of equipment and spare
parts as well as the training and technical assistance that are necessary
for or form part of the rehabilitation program. The components to be
financed are discussed in the following paragraphs.
1. Replacement of Equirement
5.21      To ensure the contirued operation of the railway linking the
mining site and the nort, the following equipment is required: about 50 km
of new railway tracl to replace some heavily worn sections, 2 new
locomotives, 10 locomotive engines, and 6 train tail wagons. In addition,
7 new large mining trucks will be put in service to replace worn out and
obsolete small trucks. Finally, the capacity of the electric line between
the Guelbs site and Zouerate will be increased, so that Zouerate can fully
benefit from the cheaper power generated by the new Guelbs units which run
on heavy fuel oil, whereas the old Zouerate units use gasoil.
2.   Major Overhauls and Improvement of Equipment
5.22      Major fixed installations comprising the material handling
facilities at Zouerate and the ship loading installations at Nouadhibou
will be overhauled to ensure that no production bottlenecks occur. The
older mobile mining equipment will be brought into good mechanical
condition for high performance. Maintenance will be rationalized and



-24-
facilitated by the purchase of key sub-assemblies, such as radiators, fuel
pumps, engines and transmissions. The railway rolling stock will be
overhauled regularly to assure adequate haulage capacity. This component
also includes the purchase of a small but critical part of SNIM's operating
supplies: tires for mine trucks, conveyor belts, wearing parts for the
mining equipment and grinding balls for the new Guelbs mills. Availability
of a sufficient amount of these supplies in the right quality is most
essential for a continuous, efficient operation.
3.  Tools and Control EquiLment
5.23      Selected new tools and machine tools will be provided for the
workshops in Zouerate and Nouadhibou to improve the quality of
maintenance. Instrumentation of fixed installations and mobile equipment
will be improved for better control and efficiency. Telecommunication
equipment for shovels, trucks, and train will be installed to allow better
monitoring and time utilization. Computers for both, operations and
financial use, will be purchased to support management efforts to improve
control and planning of operations.
4.  Training and Technical Assistance
5.24      Training and technical assistance are central to achieve the
objectives of the Project. It comprises:

Out of the total of 1,735 man-months, about 580 have already been completed
in 1984 and the first half of 1985.  It is expected that by the end of
1985, in total about 730 man-months will have been provided, financed to
78% by SNIM and 22% by the coleaders. The remaining services are already
contracted with the exception of 20 man-months for assistance to the spare
parts management and 20 man-months for courses for managers and
supervisors, both to be financed by the Bank.
E. Implementation Arrangements and Schedule
5.25      All activities will be monitored and coordinated by the Company's
controller, an experienced engineer directly reporting to the General
Manager, who during the last two years has been increasingly involved in
cost control, budgeting and the design and implementation of SNIM's cost
saving measures. The General Manager will control the execution of the
different project components through the line management. Procurement will
be handled by SNIM's procurement/purchasing department which has sufficient
experience to carry out efficiently the procurement tasks required under
the project.
5.26      Project implementation started already in mid-1984.  Completion
of the Project is expected by mid-1988. Future implementation of the
various project elements is presented in Annex 5-1, and summarized below
for key elements of the rehabilitation program:

For better monitoring of project progress and to allow early definition of
corrective steps and new targets, actions concerning the Guelbs start-up
and the reduction of personnel and overtime will be handled in two distinct
phases: the second phase, which will start July 1, 1987, requires before
its implementation an evaluation of the results of the first phase and
definition of plans and targets. Introduction of a new salary system as
well as new overhead cost reductions will only be executed in the second
phase. Achievement of certain targets of the first phase and detailed
definition of actions and targets for the second phase are a condition for
the release of the second tranche of the Bank loan (para. 6.13).
VI. PROJECT C3ST, FINANCING PLAN AND PROCUREMENT
A. Project Cost
6.01      Total project costs (including contingencies) are estimated at
US$92.2 million, of ahich US$75.4 million are in foreign exchange.
Contingencies have been estimated at US$6.7 million. The estimated cost of
the project is summarized below:

6.02      About US$36.7 million will have been expended by the end of 1985,
of which US$27.9 million is being financed by SNIM and US$8.8 million by
the Guelbs colenders.  The proposed loan of US$20.0 million, together with



-27-
additional funds from SNIM's internel cash generation (US$ 7.7 million) and
the colenders (US$27.8 million) will finance the project components to be
implemented from January 1986 to mid-1988.
6.03      Since foreign supplies and services to GNIM are exempted from
Mauritanian taxes and duties, no taxes have been c-i'culated on these
items. The costs were estimated in mid-1985 prices, dad are based on
SNIM's experience in procuring similar goods and -_ -vices over the past few
years. Actual expenditures were taken for compornints already started in
1984 and 1985 (40Z of total base cost). Physical contingencies of 3% were
added for expenditures starting 1986. This is considered adequate in view
of SNIM's experience and on-going cost saving efforts. Price contingencies
were based on an assumed international and local inflation of 7.0% in 1986
and 1987, and 7.5% in 1988. Detailed cost of the Bank-financed project
components are shown in Annex 6-1.
B.   Financing Plan
6.04      Total financing required is US$92.2 million, of which US$75.4
(82%) are in foreign exchange. All local cost (US$16.8 million) plus
US$19.6 million foreign cost are financed by SNIM from its own internal
cash generation.  The financing plan for the project  8 W follows:

6.05      The US$55.8 million foreign exchange cost, remaining after SNIM's
financing, is financed by SNIM's present lenders for the Guelbs Project,
including the Bank. Whereas the Kuwait/Arab/Abu Dhabi/Saudi Funds and OECF
have made already available unused portions of their existing Guelbs loans
under the same favorable terms, the CCCE and the Bank will contribute new
loans. The CCCE loan carries an interest rate of 5% and is repayable over
15 years, after a grace period of 5 years. The proposed Bank loan will be
made to SNIM at the standard IBRD variable interest rate, plus a guarantee
fee of 10% thereof to the Government, for a 15-year term including a 3-year



-28-
grace period, and a commitment fee of 0.75Z. The new loans will enter
under the existing trust and set-aside arrangements for the Guelbs Project.
6.06      To reduce the financial risk, the Bank, together with the
colenders, established a system under the previous Guelbs loan by which:
(i) proceeds from the sale of iron ore are allocated as a matter of
priority to debt service payment; and
(ii) sufficient foreign exchange is made available to SNIM for its
day-to-day operation.
To this end, the following agreements exist between SNIM, the Central Bank
of Mauritania, the lenders, the Societe Generale of France (SG), and Law
Debentures of U.K. (Trustee):
(a) a Security Agreement, which provides an unconditional global
assignment of revenues from iron ore sales;
(b) a Set-Aside Agreement, which provides for the mechanism of
setting aside debt service payments and SNIM's foreign exchange
needs for operations; and
Cc) a Trust Deed, which provides for the management of trust funds
for debt service payments.
6.07      SNIM instructs all its ore purchasers to make all payments for
ore purchases to a designated account at SG. SG is under irrevocable
instructions to transfer mort-hly, with priority over any other allocation,
to a trust account in London  ^ amounts needed to:
(i) accumulate the next semi-annual payment; and in addition,
(ii) accumulate and maintain a permanent cushion equivalent to the
next semi-annual payment.
SG is further under the instruction to transfer monthly out of the
remaining funds into a SNIM Operational Account the amounts needed by SNIM
to cover its foreign exchange operating expenses. Such amounts are
determined on the basis of SNIM's annual budgets, prepared in consultation
with the colenders. The remaining funds, which basically cover salaries of
SNIM's personnel and royalties to the Government, are repatriated to
Mauritania and credited to SNIM's account at the Central Bank.
6.08      The monthly transfers by SG to the London trust account are made
according to an estimate of interest and principal payments, to be
completed by the lenders up to 390 days in advance of the payment date.
For the first 6-monthly payment of interest and principal, which was due on
October 15, 1984, some lenders, including the Bank, had failed to announce
the payment within the required time period. As a result, insufficient
funds had been accumulated in the trust account, although SNIM, under the
loan agreements was still required to make timely debt service payments.



-29-
At the request of the lenders, SINM effected the due payments. Through
continued extra payments into the trust account, SNIM has accumulated the
required cushion to secure future debt service payments out of the trust
account. Apart from the incident described above, SNIM has managed its
foreign accounts well, through which about 60% of SNIM's cash transactions
are handled.
C.   Procurement
6.09      All gooda and services to be procured under the Project will be
procured in accordance with Bank guidelines, except for specific items
financed by colenders which will be procured under their own procedures.
Procurement arrangements for equipment and services are summarized in the
table below. All local costs represent entirely SNIM labor; no goods are
procured in Mauritania, and no taxes are payable on imported goods.

(7.6)    (10.4)      (2.0)     (20.0)
Note: Figures in parentheses are the amounts to be financed by the
Bank.
6.10      Out of the US$18.0 million allocated under the proposed Bank loan
for the purchase of goods and equipment (para. 6.12), about US$10.4 million
will be used for the direct purchase of spare parts and sub-assemblies from



-30-
the manufacturers of equipment and some specialized operating supplies.
Given the proprietary nature of most of these contracts, their small size
(none is expected to exceed US$300,000 equivalent) and the need to utilize
genuine spare parts, this method is considered the most efficient and
appropriate. However, the aggregate amount of sole source procurement
shall not exceed an aggregate of US$10.5 million. The balance of the Bank
loan will be used to purchase tools, instrumentation, tires for mining
trucks, conveyor belts and wearing parts for mining and beneficiation
equipment. Such goods are either purchased in small lots or are only
available from a limited number of suppliers (e.g. tools and
instrumentation) or require long testing periods before an adequate
technical evaluation can 'e completed in order to select the most
economical product for a specific application (tires, wearing parts). In
the past, SNIM has purchased such goods from well-known international
manufacturing firms. Therefore, the most appropriate procurement procedure
is limited international bidding (LIB), for all packages not exceeding
US$300,000 or equivalent, on the basis of at least four bids being invited
from at least three countries. Although not foreseen at this time, if
during project implementation larger packages could be tendered, these
would be procured by international competitive bidding (ICB) under Bank
guidelines. For all contracts not exceeding US$50,000 or equivalent,
international shopping will be applied, by inviting price quotations from
at least 3 suppliers. Due to the large number of equipment items from
various suppliers and SNIM's prudent policy to avoid stocking large
quantities of spares and materials, the number of packages to be procured
will be large (presently estimated at about 150). SNIM handles such
procurement efficiently as part of its daily operations. Purchase orders
for sole source equipment will be issued without delay as required by the
materials management system. Also the bidding procedure for LIB-procured
packages, such as for tires, conveyor belts and wearing parts, will be
timely initiated through the materials management system, Bank staff has
reviewed with SNIM procedures and documents for sole source and
LIB-procurement and found SNIM's procedures appropriate. There will be a
pre-review of all procurement documents (bidding documents, bid evaluations
and contracts) for the first ten procurement packages (excluding
international shopping) and all packages exceeding US$500,000.
6.11      Employment of consultants, who will assist SNIM in spare parts
management and teaching supervisory skills, will be in accordance with Bank
guidelines. Terms of reference, acceptable to the Bank, have been prepared
by SNIM. As to consultant services for training, contracts are already
signed with experienced expatriate individuals, who have demonstrated their
qualifications for SNIM's operations during the recent past. These
services will continue to extend at least during the Project's
implementation period. If required, some of these contracts will be
continued thereafter.
D. Allocation and Disbursement of Bank Loan
6.12      The allocation of the Bank loan to different categories and their
disbursement percentages are shown in the table below:



-31-
Allocation of IBRD Loan
(USS million)
Z of Expenditures
Category                               Amount      to be financed
(1)  Spare parts, sub-assemblies         16.7    100% of foreign expenditures
and operating supplies
(2)  Tools and control equipment          1.3    100% of foreign expenditures
(3)  Training & technical assistance    2.0    100% of total expenditures
Total                              20.0
To minimize time delays and facilitate the Bank's disbursements, a special
account (revolving fund) of US$2.0 million will be established at a foreign
bank, out of which SNIM will prepay most purchases of goods and services.
The account will be refilled upon presentation of appropriate documentation
by SNIM about the use of the funds, in accordance with the Bank's rules.
6.13      A summary of the disbursement schedule is presented below:
Disbursement of IBRD Loan
CUS$ million)
IBRD FY:                     1986        1987        1988
Annual                        3.0         7.0         10.0
Cumulative                    3.0        10.0        20.0
The schedule differs from the normal country and industry profiles by the
relatively even distribution of disbursements. This is explained by the
on-going status of the project and the recurrent nature of investments and
expenditures. Due to SNIM's familiarity with similar procurement and
desire to reduce bank overdrafts, no delays in disbursements are expected.
Disbursement against all categories will be divided into two tranches
(para. 5.26). Due to the equal timely distribution of disbursements, each
tranche is of USS10.0 million size. The first tranche covers disbursements
until about June 30, 1987. The second tranche will be released only after
the following actions have taken place:
SNIM shall have:
(i)   submitted to the Bank:  (a) audited financial statements for
1986; and (b) SNIM's long-term policy for salary levels and
structure (para. 5.17);
(ii)   achieved:  (a) a production from the Guelbs plant of not less
than 1.0 million tonnes in three consecutive months; (b) the 1986
targets on the personnel and overtime reduction (para. 5.17); and
(c) a reduction of bank overdrafts from the December 31, 1985,
level by at least US$5.0 million (para. 5.19); and



-32-
(iii)   prepared plans and targets, acceptable to the Bank, to be
implemented and achieved over the following 12 months, for: (a)
production rate and technical assistance for the Guelbs plant
(para. 5.12); (b) further improvements in spare parts management
and procurement (paras. 5.14 and 5.15); tc) further personnel
cost reductions (para. 5.17); and (d) further overhead cost
reductions (para. 5.18); and
the Government shall have:
(i)  completed a study of the public finance aspects of the royalties
on SNIM's ore sales (para. 7.05); and
(ii)  agreed with the Bank on the implementation of the recommendations
of this study.
6.14      The proposed Bank loan involves no retroactive financing.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
7.01      Financial projections for SNIM prepared in current US dollars are
based on (i) depletion of the Kedia mines and the phasing in of Guelbs so
that SNIM's production/sales volume stabilizes at 9.5 million tpy (Annex
7-'); (ii) operating costs taking into account the cost reduction achieved
in 1984 and projected additional reductions; (iii) an expected reduction of
the iron ore price by 1995 by 7Z in real terms from its 1984 level; and
Civ) variations in the UM/US dollar exchange rate that compensate for the
differential between Mauritanian price developments and world price
developments as measured by the Manufacturing Unit Value (MUV). The
projections are based on an exchange rate of UM 67 to US$1 at the end of
1984 and the following inflation assumptions:

prices in 1984 of US$17.5/t for Kedia rich ore, US$13.3/t for Kedia
silicious ore, and US$17.9/t for Guelbs ore have been taken as a base
from which the prices are expected to develop according to the
international price projections presented above. The resulting projected

7.03      Operating costs were developed on the basis of SNIM's actual 1984
cost structure for: (i) each of its existing Kedia pits; (ii) the Guelbs
mine and plant; (iii) railway and port; and (iv) overheads- Future
operating costs have been estimated on the basis of a detailed 10-year
mining/operations plan, including expected personnel and material cost
reductions due to the Rehabilitation Project. Personnel costs are expected
to be reduced by about 3-4Z per year in real terms in the period
1986-1995. The savings would be achieved through reduction/reallocation of
persomnel, reduction of overtime and adjustment of salaries. All other
operating cost, consisting mainly of materials, are expected to be reduced
by 3.8Z in real terms in each of the years 1986 and 1987, and to be kept
constant in real terms thereafter. The savings would be mainly achieved by
tighter supervision of operations, better equipment utilization and
improved spare parts management and procurement control.
A.   Financial Projections
7.04      Detailed projected financial statements are given in Annexes 7-1
through 7-3 and are summsrized below. In the period 1986-1990, the
projected savings in labor cost amount to US$23.0 million and in other
operating costs to US$26.2 million, as a result of the savings described
akove (para. 7.03). With these savings, SNIM's cumulative operating income
.n the period 1985-1990 is projected at US$138.0 million. Despite the
savings, there is an increase in operating costs in real terms as from
1986, due to the increasing Droduction of the Guelbs that requires the
costly beneficiation mentioned in para. 3.16. Therefore, SNIM's overall
cash situation, after payment of debt and royalties, will remain tight.

7.05      SNIM pays a royalty to the Mauritanian Government mounting to
10X of sales of iron ore. This tax is projected to amount to about
US$112.0 million in the period 1985-90 compared to profits beforp tax of
about US$51.0 million, and only from 1990 onwards is SNIM projected to earn
a positive income after tax. In cash terms, the tax paymentz' correspond in
that period to about 38% of net internal cash generation. Although
royalties are common in the mining sector internationally, SWIM's major
competitors do not pay as high royalties. At negotiations, assurance was
obtained that the Government of Mauritania undertakes, during project
implementation, a study of the public finance aspects of the royalties with
the assistasnce of a mining taxation expert. Acceptable terms of reference
together with a schedule of implementation for the study have been
submitted to the Bank. Completion of the study and agreement with the Bank
on the implementation of the recommendations of the study is a condition
for release of tranche 2 of the Loan (para. 6.13).



-35-
7.06      The present composition of SNIM's balance sheet is not
favorable. In 1984, current liabilities at US$94.3 million exceed current
assets by US$14.5 million (current ratio is 0.9) and long-term debt is
about equal to equity (US$203.7 million). The measures of the proposed
Project concerning cash management and accounting procedures would reduce
SNIN's reliance on short-term financing at fluctuating and potentially high
cost. The current rat-o is projected to reach 1.2 in 1986 and 2.3 in
1995. The long-term debt/equity relationship is projected to return to a
50:50 debt/equity ratio by 1990 and improve thereafter.
B.   Sensitivity Analysis
7.07      SNIM's future financial position has been examined considering:
(i) reductions in the price of iron ore; (ii) reductions in the production
volume; (iii) reductions in the cost savings obtained through the Project;
and (iv) the combination of (ii) and (iii), the "without Project' case.

a/ Sales volume down 10X and no cost savings.
b/ After capital expenditure, royalties, debt service, and external L/T

7.08      The table above summarizing the financial sensitivity of key
parameters shows that SNIN's financial performance is highly sensitive to
variations in the selected parameters: (i) with total sales in the period
1985-90 at about US$1.2 billion and an average ore price of about US$201
tonne, each US$0.1/t reduction in the assumed price of iron ore throughout
that period would increase the net financing need by about US$5 million;
(ii) without the Project, production and sales volume would likely be lower
by at least 10%, given the technical and managerial efforts envisaged under
the Project, and the result would be a net profit before royalties of
US$43.2 million below the base case; (iii) without the cost savings



-36-
attributable to the Project, operating income during the period 1985-90
would decrease by about US$50 million, causing a net cash deficit of about
US$47 million; and (iv) in the 'without Project' case (volume down 1OX and
no cost savings) the net cash deficit would increase to about US$100
million, about equal to total royalties paid in that period (US$112.0
million).
7.09      The sensitivity analysis shows that any adverse deviation from
the base case could seriously curtail SNIN's availability of funds. Since
the trust and set-aside agreements (paras. 6.06 and 6.07) ensure that
foreign debtors and suppliers are paid their dues, any cash shortfall will
reduce the funds available to the payment of local inputs, labor, and of
the royalty to the Government. The labor force is large for international
standards and wages and salaries are high for Mauritanian standards;
similarly, the level of royalty is high compared to that paid by SNIM's
competitors. Consequently, a cash shortfall could potentially be cushioned
by further cuts in labor costs and reductions in royalty payments.
C.   Financial Covenants
7.10      In order to monitor and ensure the appropriate Implementation of
the measures concerning financial management and capital structure
envisaged under the Project, the following financial covenants were agreed
upon during negotiations:
(i) SNIM will prepare and submit to the Bank, not later than April 30
of each year, starting 1986, five-year financial projections,
including foreign exchange and local currency requirements and
planned operatiug expenditures and capital investments on an
annual basis (para. 5.09);
(ii) during the project implementation period, SNDN will not make
replacement or new capital _nvestments, additional to the
completion of the Guelbs Project and the Rehabilitation Program,
exceeding in aggregate US$4.0 million, without prior agreement of
the Bank. After project completion, SNIM will not make total
annual investments exceeding US$5.5 million without prior
consultation of the Bank (para. 5.16);
(iii) SNIM will maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.1 until one
year after loan closing date, and not less than 1.3 thereafter
(para. 7.06); and
(iv)  SNIM will not incur bank overdrafts exceeding US$8.0 million on a
monthly average (para. 5.19).
D.   Auditing and Reporting
7.11      SNIM has in the past subm.tted acceptable reports to the Bank in
connection with the Guelbs Project. For the proposed Project, SNIM is
requested to submit to the Bank annual reports examined by independent



-37-
auditors acceptable to the Bank within six months of the end of the
accounting year. In addition, SNIM will submit the following regular
reports: (i) a yearly update of its five-year plan (paras. 5.09 and 7.10);
(ii) quarterly financial statements within 60 days after the end of each
quarter; (iii) minutes of quarterly budget and operations efficiency review
meetings (para. 5.10); and (iv) monthly telexes, within 10 days of the end
of each month, starting January 1986, summarizing progress in the
implementation of the rehabilitation program. FiPdlly, within six months
after the closing date of the Project, SNIM will prepare and furnish to the
Bank a completion report on the Project dealing with its implementation,
and the costs and benefits derived and expected to be derived therefrom.
Although no joint supervision with colenders is foreseen, they welcome the
Bank's involvement in project supervision.
E.   Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
7.12      The financial rate of return for the Project has been calculated
on an incremental basis in real terms. In addition to the assumptions
concerning cost savings mentioned in the discussion of the financial
projections (para 7.03), it has been assumed that the proposed
Rehabilitation Project can be credited with a level of production I million
tpy higher than in the without-project case.
7.13      The cost and benefit streams have been prepared on the basis of
the financial projections presented and are given in Annex 7-4. Based on
these assumptions, the incremental financial rate of return in real terms
is 21%. The table below summarizes the sensitivity analysis. The return
would drop to 10% if iron ore prices were 33% below forecast level, cost
savings 62% below forecast level, or project cost 57% above forecast
level. The return is most sensitive to changes in the level of cost
savings obtained. The financial rate of return of the Guelbs Project,
given actual project cost, current forecasts of iron ore prices and updated
estimates of production costs, is -3%. The financial rate of return of the
Guelbs Project combined with the Rehabilitation Project is 1%.
Sensitivity Tests on Incremental Financial Rate of Return after Royalties

(Z)
Base Case                                20.7
Iron Ore Price down 5%                   18.9
Iron Ore Price down 10%                  17.1
Cost Savings down 50%                    12.3
Project Cost up 10%                      18.0
F.   Risks
7.14      The financial risk facing the Project is substantial.  The
primary sources of risks are: (i) adverse iron ore prices; and (ii)
failure to implement appropriately and timely the cost savings and
financial measures of the Project. A conservative iron ore price forecast



-38-
based on a thorough market analysis reduces the risk of lower than
estimated iron ore prices. As to the implementation of the Project and the
achievement of its expected cost savings, the training and technical
assistance components as well as the close monitoring of the implementation
of the rehabilitation program including frequent progress reporting reduces
the risk of delayed and deficient implementation. It is the exact purpose
of the project to limit SNIM's financial risk. In view of the importance
of SNIM to the country, the Government will have to take all necessary
steps to ensure the viability of the Company. As a last resort therefore,
cash shortfalls through lower iron ore prices or cost savings could
potentially be cushioned by reduced royalty payments or further cuts in
labor costs (para. 7.09).
7.15      The management risk facing the Project is the heavy dependence of
the Project's success on management's ability to implement the
rehabilitation program. The Company's top management is highly committed
to improving the operational and financial efficiency of SNIM and is
expected to ensure that every effort be made for the timely and appropriate
implementation of the rehabilitation program. Part of the program has
already been implemented, and to further limit the managerial risk, plans
for the implementation of core components of the rehabilitation program
have been prepared and will be updated.
7.16      The project faces a commercial risk due to the unknown degree of
acceptance of the new Guelbs concentrate product. Extensive pilot scale
testing of the product before plant constructlon, the suitability of the
product for blending with high grade Carajas ore, and SNIM's firm
establishment in the European market and good marketing performance limit
this risk.
7.17      The technical risks of the project itself are small.  The
rehabilitation is relatively straightforward in technical terms: it forms
part of SNIM's recurrent investment needs and has taken SNIM's operating
capabilities into account adequately. However, there remains presently
still an uncertainty about the real production capacity of the Guelbs
plant. This risk has been reduced through extensive pilot plant testing, a
thorough plant design and extensive, highly qualified technical assistance
during the start-up phase.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
8.01      SNIM is a valuable asset for Mauritania in its capacity as an
essential source of foreign exchange earnings for the Mauritanian economy,
and improvements of SNIM's ability to generate foreign exchange are
essential to assist the Government's investment efforts in non-mining
activities, and to support its strategy of diversification of its economic
structure. SNIM is expected to generate on average about US$230.0 million
gross foreign exchange per year in current terms over the next ten years
(1986-95). The net foreign exchange inflow during that period would amount
to US$82.6 million, after taking into account on the one hand foreign



-39-
loan-taking (US$11.7 million), and on the other, foreign exchange
expenditures for capital investments (US$11.5 million), operating costs
(US$103.7 million) and debt service (US$43.0 million). The Project's
principal benefit is the preservation of SNIM through efforts to enhance
SNIM's international competitiveness.
A.   Economic Rate of Return
8.02      The economic rate of return has been calculated in real terms on
an incr?mental basis from the streams given in Annex 8-1. The economic
cost and benefit streams are measured from the viewpoint of the economy as
a whole, and consequently, all identifiable taxes and royalties have been
excluded. No shadow pricing has been applied for the foreign exchange
since the ouguiya is a free floating currency. The labor wage is judged to
reflect appropriately the economic cost of labor consisting of foregone
production in employment outside SNIM plus the cost of training necessary
for employment with SNIM. The economic rate of return of the project under
these assumptions is 25%. As in the case of the financial return, the
economic return is most sensitive to the basic assumption made concerning
the cost saving effects of the project. The economic rate of return is
reduced to 15% if: (i) cost savings are 57% below the appraisal estimate;
(ii) project costs are 40% higher than appraisal estimate; or (iii) iron
ore prices are 26X below the appraisal estimate. The economic rate of
return of the Guelbs Project, given actual project cost, current forecasts
of iron ore prices and updated estimates of production costs, is 2%. The
economic rate of return of the Guelbs Project, combined with the
Rehabilitation Project, is 5%.
B.   Foreign Exchange Benefits
8.03      Incremental foreign exchange benefits have been calculated in
constant 1985 terms, based on the streams for the incremental financial
rate of return plus debt service on foreign financing for SNIM. Revenues
have been calculated as 100% foreign exchange, as all incremental
production will be exported. The total foreign exchange portion for
operating and capital costs are about 55% and 82%, respectively. The
resulting incremental net foreign exchange benefits of the Project average
US$8 million per year over the next ten years.
C.   Other Benefits
8.04      From the point of view of the Government as a shareholder, the
Project will increase the financial revenues from SNIM and will help ensure
the aversion of further losses and the need in the short run for the
Government itself injecting additional capital to continue the SNIM
operations. In the medium-term, the improvements contained in the
rehabilitation program will calibrate SNIM to implement further financial
and technical improvements. Without short- and medium-term improvements,
SNIM would, in the long run, have neither the financial strength nor the
management and planning capacity for the genuine option to consider going
ahead with the second phase of the Guelbs Project.

IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained from SNIM that:
(i)  SNIM will prepare and submit to the Bank, not later than April 30
of each year starting 1986, five-year financial projections
(para. 7.10 (i));
(ii)  SNIM will not make, during project implementation and in addition
to the completion of the Guelbs Project and the Rehabilitation
Program, replacement or new capital investments exceeding US$4.0
million/yr without prior Bank agreement, and total investments
exceeding US$5.5 million/yr without prior Bank consultation
thereafter (para. 7.10 (ii));
(iii) SNIM will maintain a current ratio of not less than 1.1 until
one year after loan closing date, and not less than 1.3
thereafter (para. 7.10 (iii)); and
(iv)  SNIM will not incur bank overdrafts exceeding US$8.0 million on a
monthly avrarage (para. 7.10 (iv)).
9.02      Conditions of the release of the second tranche of the loan are:
SNIM will:
i)  submit to the Bank: (a) audited financial statpemnts for 1986;
and (b) SNIM's long-term policy for salary levels and structure
(para. 5.17);
(ii)  achieve:  (a) a production from the Guelbs plant of not less than
1.0 million tonnes in three consecutive months; (b) the 1986
targets on the reduction/reallocation of personnel and reduction
of overtime (para. 5.17); and (c) a reduction of bank overdrafts
from the December 31, 1985, level by at least US$5.0 million
(para. 5.19); and
(iii) prepare plans and targets, acceptable to the Bank, to be
implemented and achieved over the following 12 months, for: (a)
production rate and technical assistance for the Guelbs plant
(para. 5.12); (b) further improvements in spare parts management
and procurement (paras. 5.14 and 5.15); (c) further personnel
cost reductions (para. 5.17); and (d) further overhead cost
reductions (para. 5.18); and
the Government will:
(i) complete the study of tie public finance aspects of the royalties
on SNIM's ore sales; and



-41-
(ii) agree with the Bank on the Implementation of the recoumevdations
of this study (para. 7.05).
9.03      Given the preceding agreements and assurances, the project is
suitable for a Bank loan to SNIM of US$20.0 million, for a period of 15
years, including a three year grace period.

THE IRON ORE MARIlTI/
A. Reserves and Production
1.        World Iron ore reserves are estimated at approximately 250
billion tonnes of ore containing about 100 billion tonnes of recoverable
iron. Total iron ore resources are estimated at uore than 800 billion
tonnes. Proven resources in Mauritania are 300 million tonnes of ore
containing about 120 million tonnes of recoverable iron. High grade ores
are mined in relatively new areas such as Brazil (65% to 66Z of iron
content) and Australia (64Z), while low grade ores are produced in oLd
mines in France, Canada and the United States (26% to 32Z). The worLd
average was about 58Z iron content in !980. In Mauritania, lron content is
about 60X at Kedia and 37% at Guelbs.
2.        World production of iron ore grew at about 3.7Z per annum from
1960-75, stagnated between 1975-79, and decreased by about 7.9Z per year
between 1979-83. Reported iron ore shipments suggest that production in
1984 will be considerably higher than in 1983. Over the past two decades,
there has been a shiut in production away from the industrialized
countries, particularly the US and EC countries, toward the LDCn and
Australia.  LDCs accounted for about 41Z of total iron ore production in
1983, compared to 28% in 1960. The largest iron ore producer in 1983 was
the Soviet Union (245 million tonnes (at)), followed by Brazil (92 at),
Australia (72 mt), China (72 mt), India (48 at), the US (39 at), Canada (30
mt), South Africa (24 at) and Liberia (15 at). Their combined share of
world production in 1983 was 85%. Mauritania sold in 1983 7.4 million
tonnes, and 9.5 million tonnes in 1984. The table below summarizes
production and the rate of growth of iron ore from 1960 through 1983:

Production Costs
3.        Production costs are one of the more closely guarded secrets of
the industry, and production cost estimates for individual producers must
be approached with caution. In addition, varying accounting methods for
remaining mine life and associated capital costs, shifting exchange and
inflation rates in supplier countries increase the difficulty of comparing
production costs. The producers for this comparison consist of the US,
Canada, Austral'a and Brazil.
4.        The table below shows the comparator group's 1984 fob costs per
tonne of sinterfeed. Fob costs are here defined as those costs incurred in
delivery to the hold of a ship at the producer's terminal.

5.        The sinterfeed cost structures of these producers are similar in
that operating costs represent 75-78Z of production cost and overhead
expenses 22-25%. The relative weight of individual costs categories is
also quite uniform with three exceptions. First, Brazil's labor costs are
very low and represent only 7% of total production costs, as compared with
22-25Z for the other producers. Second, Brazil's transport and handling
costs at 28% of its total cost are relatively much higher than the average
of 17% for the other producers. Third, the relatively high energy costs in
the US, due to hard low-grade ore mined, represent 16% of total cost as
compared with an average 7% for the other producers.

6.        Australia and Brazil, the biggest producers of sinterfeed, are
also the lowest cost producers. The US and Canada are the highest cost
producers of sinterfeed. Higher costs are not limited to a few categories,
but are evident across the board.
7.        Comparative costs for the production on pellets follow similar
patterns as shown in the table below.

8.        Brazil is the lowest cost pellet producer.  Additional labor cost
advantages of US$1.42 per tonne as compared with sinterfeed are the main
reason for pellet production in Brazil being 10 less costly than in
Australia. Pellet production costs in the US are 82% higher than Brazil
and 13% higher than in Canada; the latter's costs are 60X above the
Brazilian cost.
9.        Competitiveness is not only determined by production cost but
also by transport costs which significantly influence the cost of iron ore
delivered to a given destination. Delivered 1983 costs of sinterfeed and
pellets to Europe (Rotterdam), Japan (Yokohama), and the US (Northern
Harbors) are presented in the table overleaf.

West Africa                    21.5        so
10.       The table indicates how the competitive ranking of different
producers changes as a result of freight rate diffearentials for delivery of
iron ore to specific markets. Brazil is the lowest cost supplier in the
Atlantic market in which Mauritania is competing. West African ore
delivered to Rotterdam is 6% less costly than Australian ore, although its
fob costs are 20% higher. The delivered cost of Australian sinterfeed and
pellets to Japan is respectively 4% and 15Z lower than that of the
Brazilian products, whereas respective Australian fob costs are 5% and 11Z
higher than the Brazilian ones. Canada's proximity to northern US harbors
narrows its cost disadvantage in this market; to a lesser extent this is
also the case in Rotterdam vis-a-vis Brazilian ores.
11.       The current competitive alignment presented above can be expected
to change due to two sets of factors. First, as Carajas is being phased in
from 1986, Brazilian production costs will rise due to increased
depreciation and interest charges, but Brazil can still be expected to
remain a low cost producer. The cost of West African ore rrill also
increase. Mauritania'a Guelbs project and the development of any other
deposit in West Africa will increase production costs via higher
depreciation and interest charges, and at Guelbs, higher operating costs.
Second, since iron ore prices are normally set in US dollar, any real term
variation of a producer country's current against the US dollar has
competitive implications. The effect of a real exchange rate change would
be biggest for Australia, Brazil, Canada and Sweden with local content in
production costs about 90% and smallest for West Africa where local content
is about 20Z.
C. Ownership
12.       The ownership patterns of existing iron ore mines include various
combinations of private, public, domestic, and foreign shareholding.
Countries with wholly government-owned iron ore industries include Chile,



-48-
ANNEX 4-1
Page 5 of 17
Venezuela, Peru, Algeria, and Mauritania, in addition to the CPE
producers. Wholly privately owned industries exist in Australia, the US
and France. Combined private and government ownership exists in India,
Liberia, Canada, Sweden, South Africa, and Brazil.
13.       The most significant ownership aspect is whether or not steel
companies have directly invested in a mine. During project preparation,
their financial commitment encourages other investors and leaders. Later,
during operation, they offer a relatively secure market outlet for at least
part of the production and the prospect of financial support should
difficulties arise. One motive for steel company investments in iron ore
mines is to maintain excess iron ore production capacity, which in turn
tends to keep iron ore prices stable. Investments are also made to
diversify sources of supply and secure supply in general.
14.       The table below summarizes the current steel company ownership of
iron ore mines in major producer countries. As mentioned, a large majority
of the North America mines are owned by the steel companies of Canada and
the US. In comparison, Australia, Brazil and West Africa, the major
producers of seaborne iron ore, have only minor steel company involvement
and in general operate independently.

D. Consumption
15.       The major iron ore consuming areas are North America, Western
Europe, Eastern Europe, East Asia, and Australia and New Zealand. In 1973
these accounted for 96% of world iron ore consumption and in 1983 for 92%.
The combined share of the other consuming areas (South Asia, Latin America,
and Africa) increased from 4% in 1973 to 8% in 1982. Between 1973 and
1983, the combined shares of North America and Western Europe dropped from
47% to 30%. Latin America's share went from 2% to 5%. Eastern Europe's

16.       In terms of product, the choice for modern steel plants is
essentially between sinterfeed and pellets with lump ore being used on a
percentage basis in many bLast furnaces. European and Japanese steelmakers
have preferred for economic reasons to use sinterfeed, because of the
ability to use excess heat at the steel plants. Uniformity, ease of
handling and consistent action in the furnace favors pellet, but sinter
use can be expected to remain high for the foreseeable future, especially
in Europe and Asia.  The consumption by ore type in North America, the EC
and Japan in 1975 and 1980 is shown in the table overleaf.
2/ There are no published statistics of iron ore consumption. Apparent
consumption is estimated based on iron ore production plus country
imports less country exports.

17.       Pellet consumption in the EC increased from 3.6Z of total ore
consumption in 1975 to 902 in 1980, replacing some of the lower grade
direct use ores of intra EC origin. Ores for sintering maintained their
share of consumption at 78-79Z. Pellets dominate North American
consumption. Their share iLncreased from 57.52 in 1975 to 75.1% in 1980.
Pellets account for about 17X of Japan's ore consumption. Individual data
on sinter feed and lump ore is not available, but it is estimated that
their respective shares of total consumption are 702 and 132.
E. Marketing of Iron Ore
18.       Long-term contracts have been the main instrument for marketing
iron ore and are expected to ccntinue to dominate transactions between
suppliers and consumers. Long-term contracts are usually concluded for
periods from 5 years to 10 years. The long-term contracts specify no
prices which are negotiated separately on an annual basis.
19.       The spot market for iron ore has traditionally been very small
with only about 102 being traded on a spot basis. However, due to reduced
demand and worldwide excess iron ore production capacity, the importance of
the spot market has increased in recent years. Iron ore producers face low
off-takes on their contracts and appear to be increasingly forced to make
sales on a spot basis. Steel companies tend to believe that iron over-
supply will continue for some time and take advantage of the price
opportunities offered. Strong competition for scarce demand can be



-51-
ANNEX 4-1
Page 8 of 17
expected for the rest of the 1980s, and the spot market is unlikely to
diminish during this period although major suppliers and consumers will
continue to do most of their business on the basis of long-term contracts.
20.       Iron ore from mines that are captive to the steel industry is not
marketed in the true sense, but the uteel company owners of such mines
determine their annual iron ore requirements, which then becomes the basis
for the production and shipment program. The relative importance of
captive s pplies in relation to overall market volume is greatest in North
America where they represenL about 90% of total tonnage. Captive supplies
as share of seaborne iron ore traded outside North America, the main
competitive world iron ore market, represent roughly 20% of total trade
volume.
F. International Iron Ore Trade
21.       Between 1960 and 1983, the volume of iron ore traded
internationally had doubled from 151 million tonnes to 301 million tonnes.
The two major trading areas are the Atlantic market and the Pacific market,
with two exporting countries, Brazil and Australia, supplying significant
tonnages to both markets. Mauritania exports predominantly to the EC
countries (95% of total exports in 1983). Supply profiles for the major
consumers show the US to have only one large foreign supplier, Canada,
which supplied 18Z of US requirements in 1983. The EC's major suppliers
were Brazil, Canada, and Liberia. Japan obtained ore from 11 countries,
but two, Australia and Brazil furnished 67%.
22.       The development in international iron ore trade between 1960 and
1983 is shown in the table overleaf. The two leading exporting countries
are Australia (74 million tonnes in 1983) and Brazil (70 million tonnes),
followed by USSR (33 million tonnes), Canada (76 million tonnes), and India
(21 million tonnes). Mauritania exported in 1983 7.4 million tonnes. The
major iron ore importers are industrialized countries, accounting for about
75% of total trade. Japan has become by far the largest (35 million
tonnes), Belgium-Luxemburg (18 million tonnes), and the US (14 million
tonnes).

G. Price Structure
23.       Iron products are characterized by their chemistry (including
iron content) and structure. The chemistry determines the technical
properties of the ore in steel production; the structure determines the
need for further processing (agglomeration) of the ore before being used
for steel production. Pellets can be charged directly to the blast furnace
as can lump ore but the latter can decrepitate in the furnace, thereby
lowering its value to the steel mill operator. All mine products other
than lump ore must be agglomerated and, because of the costs involved,
command lower prices when purchased in an unagglomerated form   In the past
the price differentials between pellets and lumpy ores and sinter fines,
respectively, have been enough for the mills to favor sinterfeed for their
sinter plants and/or lumpy ores for direct feed for their blast furnace.



-53-
ANNEX 4-1
Page 10 of 17
However, during the last two to three years some pellet producers, competing
in the seaborne market, have in a concerted marketing effort reduced the
differentials and pellets are now becoming economically more competitive. In
addition, pellet producers can now meet many of the steel mills' special
quality demands and this adds further to the competitiveness.
24.       There are two distinct price structures in the world.  North
America comprises one pricing area, while the rest of the market eccnomies
forms the other. Because of the integrated structure of the iron and steel
industry in North America iron ore prices are generally determined by
production costs. Consequently, the North American iron ore price has moved
over time on a continuing upward trend, reflecting increasing costs of
production. Elsewhere the price of iron ore is determined by market forces.
Most ores are priced in US$ and on an fob basis. Shipping is arranged
separately, and usually by the consumers; e.g., Japanese, US and Western
European steel companies. The major exceptions are Venezuela, India and
Brazil which own sizeable fleets.
25.       Prices quoted in the North American iron ore trade are based on the
cif Lake Erie base price. Very little ore moves at the quoted price because
most iron ore shipments come from captive mines which are owned by one or
several steel companies and operated by a mine managing company. Because of
this structure up to 95% of all North American production moves to the
consumers at cost.
26.       The delivered price of certain key ores sets the pattern for others
in the markets of Western Europe and Japan. In the former, Brazilian ore is
the price leader; in the latter, Australian ore is the key price indicator.
If other ores entering these markets are comparable in quality and grade,
they usually command the same cif price. Price competition is very intense
in both markets because of the availability of high-quality iron ores from
many sources,  Eurorean prices are traditionally set in December prior to the
year of shfjunfzt TAereas prices in the Japanese market are set later in
April, the !ff .nling of the Japanese fiscal year.
27.       International iron ore prices from 1960-84, as exemplified by
Brazilian sinter feed prices cif Europe, are shown in the table overleaf.
Throughout most of the 1960s prices decreased in current terms and in 1970
were 11% lower than in 1960. In the 1970s and through 1984, current prices
oscillated around an increasing trend line with sharp annual variations both
upward and downward. In constant terms, iron ore prices declined steadily by
62% between 1960 and 1978, reflecting the implementation of high volume and
low cost mines during that period. Between 1978 and 1983 prices in constant
terms remained relatively unchanged, indicating that in the absence of still
cheaper new capacity the long steep decline of iron ore prices in real terms
may have come to a halt.

H.  Iron Ore Demand Prospects
28.       An estimated 98% of iron ore goes to steel industry blast
furnaces to produce pig iron for steel making, and iron ore production and
consumption is inextricably linked to steel making. The demand prospects
for iron ore must be derived from the demand prospects for steel.
29.       The character of the international steel market has changed
markedly in the past two decades. During the 1960s world steel consumption
grew strongly at an average rate of 5.5Z per year. In the 1970s, steel
growth faltered and declined to 1.9% annual average growth rate. From 1980
to 1983 the world steel market collapsed and consumption declined from 712
million tonnes in 1980 to 668 million tonnes in 1983. The changes were
greatest in the industrialized countries. The intensity of use of steel
has peaked and is now declining for most industrialized countries. Steel
consumption in such countries averaged only 315 million tonnes in 1980-83



-55-
ANNEX 4-1
Page 12 of 17
compared with 411 million tonnes in 1973, the year of peak consumption.
Steel production for industrialized countries has followed a similar trend
peaking at 444 million tonnes in 1974 compared with an average production
of 356 million tonnes from 1980-83. By contrast, consumption for
developing countries (LDCs) increased steadily at an average annual growth
rate of 5.6% and 6.2Z per year respectively in the 1960s and 1970s/early
1980s to reach 171 million tonnes in 1983.
30.       Steel consumption in industrialized countries is expected to show
only minor growth in the next decade or so. However, for developing
countries substantial steel consumption growth especially in the larger
LDCs is expected in the next decade because they are in the process of
developing their basic industries and infrastructure, as well as improving
their housing and capital stock.
31.       Iron ore requirements per tonne of crude steel equivalent are
projected to decrease because of increasing steel production in electric
arc furnaces, more efficient new steel plants (continuous casting),
efficiency improvements in existing plants, the phase-out of old and
inefficient capacities, and higher average grade of ore. The trend to
lower iron consumption per tonne of crude steel produced is worldwide,
except in European CPEs, where a constant trend is forecast. Based on
detailed projections of steel demand, the derived iron demand can be
derived as presented in the table overleaf.

32.       The implied annual growth rates of future world iron ore demand
are 1.1% per year under the base case, 0.5% per year under the low case,
and 1.9% under the high case. LDCs account for 61Z of total demand growth
and European CPEs for 33%.
33.       To calculate the projected demand of seaborne iron ore, the
portion of total demand supplied from domestic sources, and through
intra-EEC, North American and CPE trade has been deducted from country
demand figures. World demand of seaborne iron ore is projected to increase
from 294 million tonnes in 1985 to 340 million tonnes in 1995, equivalent
to an annual average growth rate of 1.52. 30% of the additional demand for
46 million tonnes would be generated by LDCs, 7% European CPEs, 46% by
Asian LDCs including Asian Cr-gs, and 17% by the other LDCs. The forecast
is sensitive to iron ore demand of the Republic of Korea, which accounts
for 8 million tonnes or 17% of total additional demand. Korea is in the
process of building up large steel production capacities, which depend
mainly on steel exports. If steel export or construction plans do not
m-terialize, Korea's iron ore requirements could be much lower than assumed



-57-

here. Imports of seaborne iron ore by Asian CPEs are shown to increase
from 6 mtpy in 1985 to 11 stpy in 1995, as compared with their overall
demand growth of 20 stpy, of which 17 million tonnes is in China. The
forecast assumes that domestic sources and intra-CPE trade will supply most
of the increased requirements, and that sesborne iron ore will only be
imported at the margin. Therefore, China's imports in particular could be
considerably above those fozecast, if expansion of domestic production
capacity were to lag behind growing ore requirements. The table below
shows the demand for seaborne iron ore.

I. Iron Ore Supply Capacity
34.       Future iron ore production capacities in market economies are
shown in the table overleaf. Expansions and new projects which are in
various planning stages, but for which implementation has not yet started,
have been disregarded. The forecasts necessarily involve judgement besides
factual data particularly where mine closures for economic reasons are
involved (France, US). Also, design capacities and actual capacity
utilization show large differences in key producer countries (Australia,
India, Canada, US), and it is difficult to predict which utilization
factors will prevail in the future.

35.       Total production capacity is expected to increase slightly by
1990, but decrease by 1995 to slightly below the 1985 levels. Shutdown of
uneconomic capacities in the US, France, and Canada account for the bulk of
production reductions in IDCs. Liberia's iron ore production will cease in
the early 1990s if depleted deposits are not replaced by new developments.
Brazil's capacity increases by 26 mtpy between 1985 and 1990 as the Carajas
mine (35 mtpy) is coming on stream, Capanema produces at full capacity (10
mtpy), and CVRD's Minas Gerais production decreases.
36.       The supply capacity of seaborne iron ore is shown in the table
below. It should be noted that the high and low cases do not refer to the
availability of seaborne iron ore, but to the underlying scenarios for
total iron ore demand. Accordingly, less seaborne iron ore is available
under the high case, because domestic iron ore demand of those countries
which are iron ore producers as well as consumers absorbs a greater share
of production. For the low case, the argument is reversed. The table
indicates that Brazil and Australia can be expected to remain the dominant
suppliers over the next 10 years.  West Africa's share would decline in
absence of new developments, from 8% in 1985 to 3% in 1995.

38.       Seaborne iron ore is forecast to be in oversupply during the rest
of the 1980s.  By 1990, the high case stipulates a small supply deficit,
whereas oversupply continues under the other two cases. By 1995, the base
case projects a amall supply deficit, the high case a larger one, and under
the low case iron ore continues to be in oversupply. In summary, near- and
medium-term iron ore prospects are poor and seaborne iron ore prices are
likely to remain under pressure. Occasional price increases may well
remain limited to adjustments for (all or part of) inflation, with upward
or downward modifications to account for currency realignments.

39.       How the supply surplus will affect individual iron ore exporters
depends mainly on the steel companies' supply diversification strategy.
Product structure and quality are of importance too, but the product
differences between most producers are too small to be a major comparative
advantage or disadvantage. When considering their supply options, steel
companies will continue to favor supply from any captlve mines or
pelletizing plants that they own. EC steelmakers will need to examine
thelr supply diversification objectives in light of West Africa's probable
declining production capacity over the next 10 years. Iron ore production
in Llberia may cease entirely in the early 1990s and the corresponding EC
demand share of about 11X will have to be reallocated among the remaining
suppliers.
