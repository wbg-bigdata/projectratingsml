SULTANATE OF OMAN
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower;              Sultanate of Oman
Amount:                US$15.0 million
Terms:                 15 years, including three years of grace, at the
standard variable interest.
Project Description:  The project would support the Government's education and
training objectives, which are to improve the quality
and capacity of the education and training system to
meet the high demand for educated and skilled manpower.
The project would provide construction, equipment,
furniture and technical assistance for a teacher
training institute, two general secondary schools and a
commercial secondary school for girls. Additional TA
would be included to assist the Ministry of Education
and Youth Affairs (MOE) to improve planning, cost
control and management of the education and training
system and to support the development of technical
education. The project would contribute to the
institutional development of the MOE; improve the
quality of primary and preparatory schooling by
increasing the output of teachers, thereby alleviating
the acute shortage of Omani primary and preparatory
teachers; increase general secondary education capacity
for girls and provide for the first time commercial
training opportunities for girls, thus facilitating
female participation in the labor force and in higher
education; increase the general secondary school places
for boys and improve the quality of general and
specialized secondary schooling. There are no undue
risks anticipated. Project components are well prepared
and the MOE has the necessary implementation capacity.

I. THE EDUCATION SECTOR
1. Economic and Sector Background
1.01     Since 1970, when the present Sultan came to power, Oman has undcrgone
major structural changes. Economic infrastructure has been built up from a
very rudimentary base and the country has made impressive gains in education,
health and housing. The very large increases in personal incomes and the
rapid expansion of public services have been made possible by the commercial
exploitation of oil, which now provides nearly 90Z of government revenue and
about two-thirds of GDP. However, oil reserves are expected to be depleted in
a generation from now and the drop in oil prices since 1981, and the
consequent decline in oil revenues, has highlighted the economy's vulnerable
dependence on its oil resource. The longer term development of Oman will
depend on its ability to diversify its economic base and to develop its
industrial and agricultural resources. These are difficult tasks to
accomplish in view of the extreme scarcity of skilled manpower and the nascent
stage of development of virtually all its modern institutions. Despite its
high per capita GNP (US$5,920 in 1981), Oman is very much an underdeveloped
economy, with a relatively underdeveloped rural sector supporting about 60X of
the population of about 949,000 and a thriving modern urban sector dependent
on oil revenues and imported labor. Data for life expectancy (a low 50
years), infant mortality (a high 128 per thousand) and adult literacy (a low
30%), provide further indications that Oman is still at an early phase of its
economic and social development.
1.02     The Government's economic strategy, outlined in the Second Five-Year
Development Plan (1981-1985), is directed toward the diversification of the
production base of the economy, to lessen dependence on oil, and the
development of infrastructure, public administration and human resources.
1.03     Manpower Issues.  The critical dependence of the Omani economy on
imported labor has been increasing over time. Between 1976 and 1982, the
number of expatriates rose from 93,600 to about 209,000, representing about
55% of the total workforce. This trend can be expected to continue over the
next decade. Moreover, some 80% of the Omani labor force is unskilled, and
many of these lack any formal education. Professionals, sub-professionals and
skilled workers comprise only about 3%, 4% and 7%, of the labor force
respectively, reflecting the extreme paucity of trained Omani nationals. This
situation is mirrored in the high degree of dependence upon non-nationals in
higher level occupations requiring technically qualified professionals, where
expatriates amounted to 87% of those employed in 1981.  Although nationals are
starting to increase their representation as skilled office workers, they
still contribute less than 40% of employment (7,000 out of 17,800 in 1981).
The expatriate labor force is expected to reach about 300,000 and the total
requirements for additional workers to reach about 155,000 by 1986. Due to
the increasing complexity and sophistication of the economy, a large
percentage of the additional demand will be for professional, technical and
skilled workers (about 7%, 9% and 122, respectively). The task facing the
Education and Training System (ETS) in meeting this demand for skilled and
higher level manpower is thus very considerable.
1.04     Although still relatively low (7% of Omani public sector employment
in 1982), female participation in the labor force has increased rapidly



- 2 -
alongside increased educational opportunities (para. 1.06), and government
policy is to promote women's education in order to facilitate female
employment, and alleviate labor shortages. Public sector employment of Omani
women increased by about 81% between 1979 and 1982, compared with an overall
increase in Omani public sector employment of about 24%. Moreover, the
proportion of Omani women in the most senior public service grades (1.5%) is
almost identical to that for men (1.6%). The public sector of Oman generally,
and their level of participation in other sectors is improving. Women are
relatively well represented in education (19%), health (22%) and in the
Central Bank of Oman (18%).
Recent Developments in the Education and Training System
1.05     Administration and Management.  The Government has a strong
commitment to human resource development and to develop links between the
labor market and the ETS. The Second Five-Year Development Plan (1981-85)
correctly gives priority to the development of the ETS, including general and
specialized secondary education and teacher training, in order to meet the
country's economic needs for skilled manpower. Progress towards these
objectives is planned and coordinated by the Inter-Ministerial Education and
Training Council, chaired by the Sultan, which is responsible for overseeing
strategy and defining policy. The Ministry of Education and Youth Affairs
(MOE) is responsible for formal education, which includes primary,
preparatory, general and specialized secondary schools and teacher training
A number of other ministries, including Labor and Social Affairs and Health,
play a significant role in providing vocational training related to their
special fields (Annex 1).
1.06     Enrollment Growth and Development.  The MOE's achievements in
improving access to education are striking. School enrollments, which were
less than 1,000 in 1970, had reached 142,300 by 1982. Enrollments increased
at an annual rate of about 11% at the primary level (grades 1-6), 47% at the
preparatory level (grades 7-9), and 53% at the secondary level (grades 10-12)
during the period 1976-1982 (Annex 2, Table 1). Female enrollments have
increased proportionately even faster than male enrollments, and since 1976,
as a percentage of total enrollments, have risen from 29% to 38% at the
primary level, from 20% to 28% at the preparatory level and from 29% to 30% at
the secondary level. Gross enrollment ratios had reached about 71%, 30% and
9% for primary, preparatory and secondary levels respectively in 1982
(Annex 2, Table 2 and Chart 1).
1.07     Specialized education and training institutes, while still in their
infancy, are also being developed as a high priority. At the secondary level,
the country's first technical secondary school is under construction; an
agricultural institute has 105 students; commercial education enrolls 160
students (of whom about 70 are females, enrolled in temporary facilities
opened in 1983); and teacher training 810. Vocational training at the
post-secondary level (grades 13-14) will commence in 1984, with the opening of
a higher technical institute and the conversion of existing secondary level
teacher training facilities into post-secondary institutes. In-country
provision of higher education is planned for 1986, with the first intake into
the Sultan Qaboos University and a high priority has been accorded to the
development of a faculty of education which would train secondary school
teachers and school administrators. In order to provide higher education
opportunities at the present time, the Government provides scholarships to



about 500 Omani students pursuing higher education and training in overseas
countries.
1.08     The Government also has a strong commitment to adult education.
Literacy centers, using school facilities out of hours, trained over 8,000
adult students in 1982, double the number trained in 1976. Female enrollments
in these classes exceeded male enrollments. Additionally, evening classes
enrolled a further 8,000 adults to pursue formal education at primary,
preparatory and secondary levels.
Issues in the Education System
1.09     The Government's strategy for the rapid development of the ETS to
meet the country's needs for skilled manpower at all levels has been pursued
with significant success in increasing educational opportunities from the very
low base existing a decade ago and in developing the institutional basis for
further qualitative and quantitative improvements in the system. Following
the very rapid quantitative expansion of schooling, particularly at the
primary level, the MOE is turning its attention to the key issues which relate
to: (a) the shortage of Omani teachers; (b) the leck of secondary school
places; (c) the quality of education; and (d) the need for improved planning,
cost control and management of the ETS.
1.10     Shortages of Omani Teachers.  The acute shortages of skilled manpower
are reflected in the extreme scarcity of Omani teachers, and the Government
has had to rely heavily on expatriate teachers for the development of the
ETS. Since 1976 the number of expatriate teachers in primary, preparatory and
general secondary schools has more than doubled, from about 2,500 in 1976 to
5,900 in 1982. Although the number of Omani teachers rose from about 600 in
1976 to 700 in 1982, the proportion of nationals in these schools actually
declined, from about 14% to 1OX, as enrollments and teaching staff have
rapidly increased.l/ Moreover, the recruitment of high quality expatriate
teachers has become increasingly difficult, due to increased competition from
neighboring countries and attempts elsewhere in the region to expand primary
school enrollments. The Government has, therefore, given high priority in the
First and Second Five-Year Plans to building up the teacher training system.
Three secondary level teacher training institutes (TTIs), together with
temporary facilities elsewhere in the country, now have an enrollment of 810
students in three year secondary level (grades 10-12) primary teacher training
programs, as well as one year programs for secondary school graduates. A
fourth institute is under construction and a fifth is planned under the
proposed project (para. 2.03). Over 300 graduates from the TTIs entered
teaching in 1983. In order to provide in-country training opportunities for
secondary school teachers and school administrators, a faculty of education at
Sultan Qaboos University is plamned to open in 1986.
1.11     The Government recently reviewed its teacher training programs and
has judged that the three year secondary level program produces graduates who
are too young and too poorly prepared to begin teaching immediately.
Moreover, a secondary TTI graduate is ill-equipped to teach at preparatory
level, where the demand for indigenous teachers is as critical as at the
primary level (Annex 2, Table 2), or to proceed to further training to qualify
to teach at secondary level. To improve the quality of TTI graduates, and
also to increase the output of trained teachers, the Government has therefore
decided to convert the three year secondary program to a new two year post-
1/ About 37% of Omani teachers and 32Z of expatriate teachers are women.



secondary (grades 13-14) program, starting in 1984. The new post-secondary
teacher training program will also promote a more efficient and flexible use
of teachers by emphasizing nultisubject and multigrade teaching.
1.12     In order to attract high quality entrants to teaching, the Government
pays attractive stipends to trainee teachers, in a&ldition to providing free
tuition and boarding. As a result, there has been no shortage of applicants
for teacher training places and drop out rates are low. 1/ Salaries and
allowances for qualified teachers are reasonably attractive by comparison with
other public sector employment and are particularly so for women, who in 1982
comprised 44% of teacher training enrollments, compared to only 30Z of
secondary school enrollments.
1.13          Despite these efforts to increase the supply of Omani teacher.,
the demand for teachers will continue to outstrip supply for the foreseeable
future. Table 1.1 shows that although the proportion of Omani teachers is
expected to increase rapidly, from about 10% in 1982 to about 31% in 1988 and
47% in 1994, the number of expatriate teachers in primary, preparatory and
general secondary schools is expected to rise from its 1982 total of 5,900 to
about 6,580 in 1988 and 7,450 in 1994. This has continued implications for
the quality of education, for the reasons outlined in para. 1.18.

1.14     Shortage of Secondary School Places.  The Government's efforts to
lessen dependence on expatriates in higher level occupations are hampered by
the shortage of secondary school places (grades 10-12). In 1982, only 4,130
students were enrolled in general secondary schools, with graduates from these
schools totalling about 700. Gross enrollment ratios, at about 12% for boys
and 52 for girls 1/, are amongst the lowest in the EMENA region. Competition
for secondary schooling is intense, with places allocated on the basis of
results in the preparatory school examination at the end of grade 9. In 1982
approximately 502 of preparatory school graduates went on to secondary
schooling. The pressure on secondary school places will grow as opportunities
for post-secondary education and training increase (para 1.07).
1.15     Government policy for secondary education is to expand the provision
of general secondary places, with intake at grade 10 increasing from about
2,100 in 1982, to 4,300 in 1988. Two new general secondary schools are
planned under the proposed project (para. 2.08). By 1988, general secondary
school enrollment ratios would reach about 212 for males and 11% for females.
Priority will be given to the science stream of the three year curriculum
(students specialize in the second and third years between arts and sciences)
so that approximately two thirds of all students will specialize in science
subjects. 2/ About 70Z of the projected 2,800 general secondary school
graduates in 1988 would be absorbed by higher education or training in Oman or
abroad, with the rest proceeding to employment.
1.16     The Government is also placing high priority on the development of
specialized secondary schools. An agricultural school constructed with Bank
assistance under the first education project (Loan 980-OK), graduated its
first group of 44 students in 1982. The first commercial school for boys
opened in 1983 and a similar school for girls is planned under the proposed
project to open in 1988 (para. 2.12), while in the meantime students will be
accommodated in temporary facilities. The first technical secondary school
(grades 10-12) with a capacity of 216 will open in 1984. It is intended that
about 75% of the graduates from these schools (including the girls' comercial
school) will enter the labor market in middle level skilled occupations in
commerce, government, industry or agriculture. In order to increase the
popularity and status of the commercial, technical and agricultural schools,
approximately 25% of graduates, who receive the highest marks in the final
secondary examination. will be eligible to proceed to further post-secondary
training or higher education in Oman or abroad. 3/
1/ Data for enrollments at general and specialized secondary schools - see
Annex 2, Table 2.
2/ About 582 of boys and 492 of girls in grades 11 and 12 were enrolled in
science streams in 1982.
3/ Of the 44 graduates of the agricultural school in 1982, approximately 75%
entered skilled occupations in the public and private sectors and 252
proceeded to further studies abroad.



1.17     Despite the progress made in developing secondary schooling,
shortages of capacity will continue to be a major problem for some time to
come, and continued priority will need to be given to expanding both general
and specialized secondary schooling to provide sufficient numbers to satisfy
the needs of the labor market, or to proceed to higher education or further
training.
1.18     Quality of Education.  The very rapid expansion of the education
system has had some detrimental effects on the quality of education. Three
key reasons include; (a) the increasing difficulty in recruiting well trained
and high quality expatriate teachers (para. 1.10) and the Government's
reluctance to provide in-service training to expatriates because of the short
duration of their contracts (usually between 2-4 years). Futhermore, the
living conditions under which expatriate teachers work are sometimes poor. As
a result, teachers may be poorly motivated and ill-suited by training; (b) the
Government has had to rely on imported curricula, with which teachers may be
unfamiliar and ill-suited to teach. For example, despite well equipped
science laboratories in many of the secondary schools, the teaching of science
suffers, because the teachers are often unfamiliar with the requirements of
teaching experimental and practical work. As a result, science laboratories
and equipment are underutilized, despite the emphasis on experimental work in
the new secondary school curricula introduced in 1982. The proposed project
would provide assistance to improve science teaching (para. 2.11); and (c) the
departments in the MOE responsible for teacher training, curriculum and
educational development and inspection are themselves at an early stage of
development and have found it difficult to evaluate progress and exercise
quality control as the system has expanded.
1.19     Despite these problems, which are recognized by the Government, the
ETS appears to be performing reasonably efficiently, with historical
transition rates averaging about 902 at primary, preparatory and secondary
levels.
1.20     Planning, Cost Control and Management of the ETS.  The expansion of
the ETS has been so rapid that insufficient attention has been given to
planning, cost control and management. In order to implement the expansion
program, the MOE has created a number of specialized Directorates, including a
Directorate for Educational Development (see MOE Organization Chart,
Annex 3). Within this Directorate is a small Planning Department, whose
responsibilities include school mapping, the planning of new schools,
enrollment projections and compilation of education statistics. The Planning
Department also plays an important role in the preparation of education
projects. This key role in planning future investments in the ETS is hampered
by a lack of suitable technology, methodology and appropriately trained staff
to compile and analyze data, and provide the necessary inputs for policy
decisions. In particular, there is a need to improve and coordinate the
various techniques being used for school location planning and to provide
improved forecasting of future capacity needs as a basis for investment
decisions. This task is particularly relevant within primary education, where
full enrollment of the primary age cohort may be achieved by 1990 (para. 1.22).
1.21     In addition, coordination between the various departments involved in
education planning and project implementation needs to be improved, with a



- 7 -
greater use of financial information to inform decision making. Because of
the heavy burden imposed by the large construction program during the recent
period of rapid expansion, the MOE has been unable, as yet, to give sufficient
attention to measures to reduce costs such as improved school management,
standardization of designs, and planned maintenance. Control of costs would
also be facilitated by a financial reporting system which enabled information
on education costs to be compiled both by region and by level of education to
provide an improved basis for financial analysis. Technical assistance (TA)
to improve financial planning, cost control and management procedures would be
included in the proposed project (para. 2.15(a)).
Education Policy and Budgetary Support
1.22     The educational objectives of the MOE in the Second Five-Year Plan
(1981-1985) and beyond, although ambitious, are reasonable, and will require a
major investment in human resources. The program has three main thrusts; (a)
to develop the formal education system, including primary, preparatory,
secondary general and specialized schools and post-secondary teacher training;
(b) to improve the quality and effectiveness of existing programs; and (c) to
establish effective monitoring and review procedures to assist future
development of the ETS.
(a) Development of the School System. The MOE plans to continue the
rapid expansion of the ETS, with primary, preparatory and general secondary
school capacity increasing at an annual rate of about 9%, 13% and 20%
respectively between 1982 and 1988 (Annex 2, Table 1). 1/ The planned level
of expansion of primary education should result in practically all primary
school age children having access to primary education by the end of the
decade, and careful planning of school location and size will be needed to
avoid excess primary school capacity. Gross enrollment ratios at preparatory
and secondary levels are planned to reach about 50% and 16% respectively by
1988. By 1988, the specialized secondary school system would comprise two
secondary commercial schools with a total capacity of 540, an agricultural
secondary school with a capacity of 180 and a secondary technical school with
a capacity of 216. To support the rapid expansion of primary and preparatory
education, post-secondary teacher training capacity would reach about 1,400 by
1990 with a projected annual output of about 620 (Annex 4, Tables 1 and 2).
(b) Quality and Effectiveness. MOE policy to improve the quality and
effectiveness of education has not yet been clearly articulated and quality
improvement will be difficult to achieve without a major effort to train
expatriate as well as national teachers, school managers and inspectors and
improve MOE monitoring, supervision and curriculum activities (para. 1.18).
This process is necessarily long-term and will depend on the speed with which
trained Omanis enter education management and teaching. The Government is
aware of the need for improvements and the proposed project would assist
1/ The 1981 school construction program, which included 48 schools plus
various additions and renovations to existing buildings, is now virtually
complete. This added about 13,500 school places (about 13% of 1981 school
capacity). Based on this record, the MOE expansion plan, although
ambitious, appears to be feasible, requiring the addition of about 18
primary schools, seven preparatory schools and two secondary schools per
year between 1982 and 1988.



- 8 -
curriculum development (paras. 2.07, 2.14 and 2.15(b)) and the training of
Omani and expatriate teachers through the preparation of teachers' guides
(para. 2.11).
(c) Monitoring and Review. The Inter-Ministerial Education and Training
Council (para. 1.05) provides strong policy guidance and support to the MOE
and other Ministries responsible for education and training. The Council has
recently turned its attention to issues of management and efficiency in the
ETS and has requested the Bank supported Manpower Planning Department (MPD) in
the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labor (MOSAL) to work in cooperation with
the MOE to evaluate the internal efficiency of the ETS and define priorities
for various levels of education and training. In addition, the MPD will
monitor the output from the various levels of the ETS, including the MOE
general and specialized secondary schools, to evaluate their success in
replacing skilled expatriates. The MPD will liaise closely with the schools
and employers in this task and provide feedback, which will be used to plan
future Levelopments. These important initiatives should assist the Government
to establish close links between the ETS and the labor market.
1.23     Budgetary Support.  As a result of the rapid and justified expansion
of education, educational expenditure, initially small, has been increasing
rapidly over the last six years. By 1982, education capital and recurrent
expenditure represented about 7% and 17% of national capital and recurrent
expenditures respectively, and 3.4% of GNP, ratios comparable with neighboring
countries. The school building program resulted in capital expenditure
growing at the high annual rate of 48% between 1976-82, while national capital
expenditure grew at 8% annually over the same period. During the same
timespan, recurrent education expenditures grew at an annual rate of 32%,
while national recurrent expenditure increased at an annual rate of 22%.
Teachers' salaries and allowances accounted for 72% of all recurrent
expenditure in 1982. This is a low figure by comparison with other borrowers
in the EMENA region, but is comparable with neighboring countries and reflects
the relatively high cost of labor for building maintenance in Oman. Unit
costs of education, about US$820 for primary and US$2,600 for preparatory and
general secondary, are high, the result of; (a) the presently necessary high
salaries and allowances paid to both Omani and expatriate teachers to attract
Omanis to the teaching profession and to compete for good quality expatriate
teachers with wealthier neighboring countries (para. 1.10); (b) the rather low
student- teacher ratios prevailing in the system, particularly at preparatory
and secondary levels (para. 1.24); and (c) the need to provide boarding
facilities in many preparatory and secondary schools so that students in
outlying areas can participate in preparatory and secondary education.
1.24     As a result of a slower rate of enrollment growth (Annex 2, Table 1)
and the completion of much of the school building program, education capital
expenditures should not show further significant increase. While education
recurrent expenditures are expected to rise through the end of the decade,
their potential growth should be minimized by a more efficient and economical
use of teachers and improved student-teacher ratios. In 1982, student-teacher
ratios for primary, preparatory and general secondary schooling were a low
25;1, 12:1 and 15;1 respectively. With these student-teacher ratios, the
planned expansion of primary, preparatory and secondary schooling (para. 1.22)



- 9 -
would result in an annual rate of increase in recurrent expenditure between
1982-1988 of about 6Z. Modestly increased, and educationally acceptable,
student-teacher ratios of 30:1, 20;1 and 16;1 for primary, preparatory and
secondary schooling respectively, with which the MOE concurs 1/, would result
in an annual growth of recurrent expenditures during the same period of
about 2%. Likewise, capital expenditures can be contained by improved school
location planning, standardization of school designs and increased attention
to building costs and maintenance. The proposed project would assist the
Government effect such cost limiting measures (para. 2.15(a)).
The Bank's Role in Education and Training.
1.25     Previous Experience.  The Bank has so far provided one loan of USS5.7
million for an education project (Loan 980-OM), approved in 1974 and closed on
schedule in 1980. This project provided support for establishing primary
teacher training, introducing diversified education at preparatory level and
training agricultural technicians. The Project Completion Report (PCR) of
October, 1981, and the Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) No. 3849 dated
March 9, 1982, note that the project was successful in supporting the
Governments' efforts to lay the foundation of a modern education and training
system. Among other things, the project: (a) provided new education
programs, including a modern approach to teacher training; (b) imparted a
knowledge of systems and procedures for the design, planning and execution of
physical implementation; (c) stimulated educational planning; and
Cd) introduced the concepts of diversified preparatory education and of
practical, pre-vocational exposure at the preparatory level. Moreover, the
HOE adopted the project procedures for procurement and for the receipt and
installation of school furniture, equipment and supplies and the Government's
Tender Board eventually adopted many of the project bidding and tendering
procedures for application to all public works. As part of the development of
education planning, the Government established the Inter-Ministerial Education
and Training Council (para. 1.05).  The PPAR and PCR highlighted cErtain
weaknesses in the design and management of TA. Nevertheless, the reports
conclude that the TA contributed substantially to education development and
institution building. The experience gained during implementation of the
first project has been taken into account in the design of TA for the proposed
project. In particular, the proposed TA package reflects the requirements of
the project and the capacity of the M0E to utilize TA; and with particular
reference to fellowship training, the relatively small number of qualified
Omani counterparts able to utilize such training.
1.26     The Bank has also supported training through loans to sectors such as
highways and telecommunications and a TA project which helped develop economic
planning and establish the Technical Secretariat of the Development Council.
Ongoing support is being provided through reimbursable TA to help establish
the MOSAL Manpower Planning Department. The current program focuses on
improvement of the data base for manpower planning.
1/ The proposed project general secondary schools would have a student-teacher
ratio of about 16:1, excluding administrative staff.



- 10 -
1.27     Future Strategy.  The objective of Bank involvement in the education
and training sector is to support government policy to alleviate labor
shortages through the cost effective development of human resources. In the
proposed project, support would be given, among other things, to increased
female participation in education and training, to the further development of
teacher training and to measures to reduce recurrent and capital costs of
education. The Bank's dialogue with the Government is expected to continue
beyond the lifetime of the proposed project, through reimbursable TA to
support institution building in key agencies involved in the development of
education and training, such as the MOE and MOSAL.

II. THE PROJECT
Introduction
2.01     The proposed project is designed to assist the Borrower achieve key
education and training objectives, which are to: (i) improve the quality of
primary and preparatory schooling through increased provision of teacher
training; (ii) increase the capacity and quality of secondary education;
(iii) provide increased education and training opportunities for girls; and
(iv) improve planning, management, and financial procedures in the MOE.
Accordingly, the project would;
(a) support the expansion of teacher training for primary and preparatory
school teachers through the construction of a new teacher training
institute for boys;
(b) provide increased secondary schooling through the construction of two
general secondary schools (one for boys and one for girls) and a
girls' commercial secondary school;
5c) improve the quality of secondary education through the development of
specialized curricula and teachers' guides; and
(d) improve planning, management and financial procedures in the MOE by
introducing new planning and cost control techniques.
2.02     To achieve the above objectives, the project would provide civil
works, equipment, furniture and TA as follows;
(a) construction, furniture and equipment for:

(b) TA 1/ (total 42 staff-months of expert services) related to the
project institutions for: (i) the development of teacher training
(12 staff-months of expert services); (ii) the preparation of
teachers' guides and training programs for general secondary school
science teachers (18 staff-months of expert services); and (iii)
curriculum and staff development for commercial secondary schools (12
staff-months of expert services); and
(c) Additional TA (total 64 staff-months of expert services and 20
staff-months of fellowships) related to; (i) improved planning, cost
control and management in the MOE (30 staff-months of expert services
and 20 staff-months of fellowship training); (ii) curriculum
development for the secondary technical school (28 staff-months of
expert services); and (iii) project implementation (6 staff-months of
expert services).
Teacher Training Institute
2.03     The project would assist the MOE to expand teacher training by
constructing, furnishing and equipping a boys' TTI with a capacity of 240
students in grades 13-14 and a projected annual output from the two year
program of 110. The construction of this TTI would complete the Second
Five-Year Plan program for the development of teacher training (para. 1.10)
and would increase the annual output of trained teachers by about 18% by 1990
(Annex 4, Tables 1 and 2).
2.04     The TTI would offer a two year post-secondary teacher training
program designed to prepare teachers for primary (grades 1-6) and preparatory
(grades 7-9) levels. A new teacher training curriculum, text books and some
teaching materials have been prepared with TA from neighboring countries, and
will be introduced into the existing TTIs in 1984. The new curriculum is
related to the recent introduction of an integrated school curriculum for
grades 1-9 and includes general education in all subject areas (13Z), advanced
training in a specialist subject such as Mathematics, Science, English,
Arabic, or Social Studies (35%), and professional training in the principles
and methodology of primary and preparatory school teaching (52%). During the
two year program, students will undergo about five weeks of supervised
teaching practice in teaching laboratories and nearby schools. By contrast to
the three year secondary level teacher training program which it replaces, the
new two year post-secondary program has three main advantages, namely;
Ca)  pedagogical subjects such as counselling, measurement, evaluation and
educational administration comprise about 75% of the new curriculum,
compared with 18% at the secondary level;
(b) the new curriculum emphasizes small group and individual assignments
appropriate to post-secondary instruction; and
1/ A summary of the composition and implementation schedule of the TA program
can be found in Annex 5.



- 13 -
(c) the program will prepare teachers capable of nultisubject teaching in
grades 1-3 and multigrade specialist subject teaching in grades 4-9,
thereby promoting a more efficient and economical use of teachers and
improved student-teacher ratios (para. 1.24).
2.05     The TTI would accommodate about 24 students per class, with a
reasonable space utilization of about 80% for general purpose classrooms and
70% for specialist teaching areas. The TTI would be located at Sur, a major
regional center, to provide an equitable distribution of teacher training
facilities around the country and to serve as both a local and national
teacher training resource. Thus, in addition to taking students from the
locality of Sur, the TTI would also enroll about 65% of its students from
other regions of the country and would accordingly include boarding facilities
for 160 students. In order to attract high calibre senior staff to the
institute and to ensure efficient and continuous monitoring of TTI activities,
including boarding facilities, three staff houses would be provided for the
Director and two Deputy Directors of the TTI.
2.06     The TTI would receive its first intake of 120 students in 1988 and
reach full capacity in 1989. Thereafter, a total of 25 teacher trainers would
be required to staff the school. With the exception of an Oamani Director, the
MOE would staff the TTI with expatriate teacher trainers during the first
years of operation after 1988. The teacher trainers would be recruited from
neighboring Arab countries and are expected to be readily available.
Thereafter, the MOE's policy, which is reasonable, is to replace expatriates
gradually with Omanis who have been trained abroad, or from graduates from the
Sultan Qaboos University Faculty of Education (para. 1.07).
2.07     To strengthen the new teacher training curriculum further, 24
staff-mwnths of expert services would be provided to prepare teaching
materials and audio-visual aids and to assist the introduction of modern
teacher training and classroom techniques. The experts would be based at the
oldest established TTI at Qurum, which was assisted under the first education
project (980-OM). The Qurum TTI, which is situated adjacent to the MOE
Teacher Training Department (see Organization Chart, Annex 3), will act as a
national in-service training and development resource to assist the TTIs in
the introduction of the new curriculum and to monitor and evaluate the
effectiveness of the new program.
General Secondary Schools (grades 10-12)
2.08     The project would help expand and improve secondary educational
Dpportunities in the Sharqyah and Batinah regions by constructing, furnishing
and equipping a boys' general secondary school at Ibra and a girls' general
secondary school at Saham. Each school would provide secondary school
opportunities for students throughout the region in which they would be
located. The two schools would each have a capacity of 576, an estimated
annual output of about 150 and would reach full enrollment by 1990. The two
schools would increase projected general secondary school capacity by about 5%
for boys and 11% for girls by 1990 (Annex 4, Table 3). About 70% of the
graduates from the two schools would proceed to higher education or training,
with the remainder proceeding to employment (para. 1.15).



- 14 -
2.09     The curriculum for the proposed schools was introduced into the
existing general secondary schools in 1979 and is acceptable to the Bank. The
curriculum emphasizes a core program of subjects including mathematics,
languages and cultural studies. At the end of the first year (grade 10),
students opt for either an arts or science stream (para. 1.15), with about 35%
of the curriculum in grades 11 and 12 devoted to specialized arts or science
subjects. The curriculum for the boys and girls schools contain few
significant differences, with the exception that home economics is emphasized
in the girls' curriculum.
2.10     The size of the proposed schools has been determined on the basis of
projected preparatory school enrollments and outputs in the regions in which
the schools would be sited. In order to provide opportunities for the
approximately 50% of students in the region living outside the immediate
location of the school, each school would be provided with 280 boarding
places. School facilities, based on an average class size of 32, have been
planned for a reasonable utilization of about 80% for classrooms and 60Z for
laboratory and other specialized facilities. When fully operational in 1990,
the two schools would require a total staff of 65, who, with the exception of
directoral staff, would largely be expatriates during the initial period of
operation.
2.11     The proposed project would include 24 staff-months of expert services
to assist the MOE to improve the teaching of science and the utilization of
science laboratories and equipment in the general secondary schools (para.
1.18). This would be achieved by the preparation of teachers' guides to
assist science teachers to prepare simple demonstration experiments and
involve students in laboratory work. The guides would be prepared by experts
working with the MOE Curriculum Development Department (Annex 3), which would
also supervise their introduction and use in the secondary schools. The
experts would also assist counterparts in the MOE Curriculum Development
Department to prepare short training programs for science teachers in
practical science work. In addition, the experts would assist the MOE to
review the utilization, layout and equipment requirements of the secondary
school science laboratories.
Girls' Commercial Secondary School.
2.12     The project would significantly help expand training opportunities
for girls, by constructing, furnishing and equipping the country's first
secondary commercial school for girls (grades 10-12), with a capacity of 270
and an estimated annual output of 80. The school would be located in the
Muscat region to serve the major public and private sector organizations and
government offices which are now beginning to employ female middle level
skilled office workers (para. 1.04). The school will complement the boys'
commercial secondary school which opened in the capital region in 1983.
2.13     The size of the school has been determined on the basis of projected
outputs from the girls' preparatory schools and the anticipated demand for
commercial secondary school graduates. School facilities, based on an average
class size of 30, have been planned for a utilization of about 85% for
classrooms and 65% for specialized teaching areas. When fully operational in
1990, the school would require a total staff of 15, who would be expatriates
during the early years of operation and would be readily available for
recruitment from other Arab countries. The school would recruit students on a



- 15 -
countrywide basis and accordingly, 180 boarding places would be provided for
students domiciled outside the capital area. In line with government policy
to attract high quality senior staff to key national education and training
institutions, staff housing would be provided for the Director and two
Assistant Directors of the school.
2.14     The curriculum for the girls' commercial school will be similar in
content to that already in use in the boys' commercial school. General
subjects, of which Arabic and English account for two-thirds, represent 56% of
the teaching program, with the remaining 44% devoted to commercial subjects,
which include Arabic and English typiag, bookkeeping, accounting and business
studies. The comnercial topicc in the curriculum need updating to reflect the
introduction of modern office technology and procedures in Oman, and 12
staff-months of expert services would accordingly be provided to upgrade the
co=nercial school curriculum in the areas of modern office skills, business
machines and office management. The experts would undertake a needs analysis
in cooperation with the MOE and public and private sector organizations to
determine appropriate skill requirements and related syllabi. Short
inr-service training programs would be conducted in both the boys' and girls'
commercial schools to train staff in the new curriculum.
Additional Technical Assistance.
2.15     In addition to the TA directly related to project institutions
described above, the project would provide TA as follows:
Planning, Cost Control and Management. The project would provide 46
staff-months of expert services and 20 staff-months of related
fellowship training to assist the MOE to; (i) introduce effective
education planning techniques including forecasting of future
capacity needs, school location planning and the development of
education statistics; (ii) develop cost-accounting methods which
would provide more precise financial information for policy makers;
(iii) introduce appropriate school management techniques for the
project schools; and (iv) update and assist Projects Department staff
on project preparation and management methods (para. 3.11).

III. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, IMPLEMENTATION AND DISBURSEMENT
Project Costs
3.01     Su&nary of Project Costs.  The total cost of the project is estimated
at RO 8.2 million or US823.9 million equivalent (Annex 6), plus a Front End
Fee of US00.04 million, which would be paid directly by the Government before
loan effectiveness. The estimated total cost and foreign exchange components
by main project items are summarized below:

3.03     Basis of Cost Estimates.  Estimated construction costs for the
project are based on unit prices derived from current contracts and cost
analysis for similar standards of construction in corresponding facilities,
with adjustments of 5 to 10Z for regional cost differences. The latter costs
per square meter of gross construction area, which average USt520 equivalent,
are reasonable for the economic and functional standards of construction
allowed for, and are below the median construction costs for comparable
Bank-wide assisted school construction (US$590 equivalent at mid 1984
prices). Costs for professional architectural services reflect the current
scale of fees established for services provided by foreign architectural
firms. Estimated equipment costs are based on current c.i.f. unit prices,
adjusted to include local transportation costs and where appropriate,
installation costs. Furniture estimates reflect percentages of construction
costs represented by the relationship between furniture and construction costs
experienced for similar institutions in Oman. Estimated TA costs, which draw
on recent experience, average US$11,000 equivalent per staff-month for



- 18 -
expatriate expert services, inclusive of salary, fee, overhead, international
travel and subsistence and US$3,100 per staff-month for fellowship training.
Baseline costs reflect estimated prices at the time of scheduled negotiations
(April 1984).
3.04     Unit Areas and Unit Costs.  Area allocations and costs per student
place are shown in Annex 7. Gross construction area per student place for the
project institutions for academic, communal and boarding facilities are in
conformity with present standards. Area allocations for staff housing are
based on local standards designed for the extreme climatic conditions. Total
capital costs (construction, furniture and equipment) reflect the high costs
of construction in Oman, where the majority of labor and 80% of materials are
imported.
3.05     Customs Duties and Taxes.  Project cost estimates do not include any
import duties or taxes. The amount of duties paid on building materials
imported by building contractors are not accurately identifiable. Equipment
and goods imported for use by government ministries are exempt from duties.
3.06     Contingency Allowance.  The project cost includes a contingency
allowance for unforeseen physical events equal to 10% of the estimated costs
of construction, furniture and equipment, and 5% of the estimated cost of TA.
The project cost also includes price eacalation contingencies calculated for
the period beginning at negotiations (April 1984) and in accordance with the
implementation schedule described in Annex 8. Estimated annual rates of price
increases for various categories of expenditure are indicated in Table 3.3
below.
Table 3.3 PROJECTED ANNUAL PRICE ESCALATION
(Local and Foreign Costs)
1984               1985             1986-1990

Prices are expected to increase during the project implementation period by a
total of 20.0% for civil works, 27.7Z for furniture and equipment, 11.0% for
TA expert services and 25.5% for fellowship training. Accordingly, aggregated
price increases are estimated at about 19.6% of baseline cost, plus physical
contingencies. Total contingencies are estimated to be about 30.9% of the
baseline cost.



- 19 -
3.07     Foreign Exchanpe Component. The estimated foreign exchange component
is US$19.4 million equivalent or about 81.2% of the total project cost. The
calculation of the foreign exchange component is based on the expectation
that: (a) almost all labor and materials for civil works will continue to be
imported, but that all construction contracts will be awarded to locally based
firms; (b) architectural services will be provided by locally-based foreign
firms; and (c) all furniture and equipment will be imported. The resulting
foreign exchange content of each category of expenditure is as follows:
(a) construction, 80%; (b) architectural services, 80%; (c) furniture and
equipment, 90Z; and (d) experts and fellowships, 80%.
Project Financing.
3.08      The proposed loan of US$15.0 million equivalent would finance 77.22
of the total estimated foreign exchange cost of the project. The Borrower
would finance the remaining 22.8% of the foreign exchange cost and 100% of the
local costs, amounting to a total of US$8.9 million (37.32 of the total
project cost). The proposed financial plan is summarized below:
Table 3.4 PROPOSED FINANCIAL PLAN a/

a/ Including physical and price contingencies.
3.09     Recurrent Costs.  When fully operational the annual recurrent cost of
the project institutions would be about RO 1.8 milliLa, which would represent
about 2.3% of the projected MOE education recurrent expenditures in 1988.
This increase is anticipated to be fully within the Government's fiscal
capability, and could be absorbed by savings accrued from increased
student-teacher ratios (para. 1.24).

Project Implementation
3.10     Implementation Period.  The construction, furnishing and equipping of
all institutions and the TA component are scheduled to be completed by
December 31, 1989, as shown in the implementation schedule in Annex 8. In
order to allow sufficient time for submission of the final withdrawal
applications, the closing date would be December 31, 1990.
3.11     Project Management.  Implementation of the project would be managed
by the Projects Department in the MOE Directorate for Financial Affairs. The
Projects Department, which was set up during the first Bank education project
(930-OM), is responsible for all new MOE construction projects in Oman and is
successfully implementing the large school expansion program. The technical
staff of the Department comprise a chief engineer, one electrical engineer,
five civil engineers, two junior architects and a junior quantity surveyor.
To strengthen its day-to-day implementation capabilities, the Department has
received a budget from the Ministry of Finance to recruit a qualified and
experienced senior architect, and a quantity surveyor. During negotiations
assurances were received that these two professional staff would be employed
by January 1, 1985. The project would provide 16 staff-months of expert
services and two staff-months of fellowship training to upgrade the project
preparation and management capabilities of the Projects Department (para.
2.15(a) and Annex 5).
3.12     Project School Sites.  Except for the site for the commercial school,
sites for all project schools had been selected and acquisition procedures
finalized by the time of the appraisal mission. All sites are satisfactory
and have access to electrical power and adequate water supply. Evidence of
the selection and acquisition of sites for all the schools included in the
project was provided to the Bank during negotiations.
3.13     Building Design.  Architectural design work is being carried out by
two experienced foreign architectural firms who have been engaged by the
Projects Department as consultants, respectively for; (a) the two general
secondary schools; and (b) the TTI and the commercial secondary school. These
firms would also supervise construction of the project institutions. Sketch
plans for the TTI and the commercial secondary school have been reviewed and
commented on by the Bank. Sketch plans for the general secondary schools are
under preparation and would be submitted to the Bank for review and comment by
June 30, 1984. Final construction drawings, together with bid documents are
scheduled to be completed by September 30, 1984.
3.14     Equipment & Furniture.  Basic equipment and furniture lists have been
reviewed and commented on by the Bank. Preliminary equipment and furniture
lists, specifications and bid documents have been prepared by the MOE Projects
Department in cooperation with the Departments of General Education, Teacher
Training and Technical Education (Annex 3), which have responsibility
respectively for the general secondary schools, the TTI and the commercial
secondary school. Preliminary equipment and furniture lists and
specifications were submitted to the Bank during negotiations. Bid documents
and detailed specifications are under preparation by consultants and will be
forwarded to the Bank for review by the end of September, 1984. The
consultants will also supervise procurement of furniture and equipment. ICB
for equipment and furniture is expected to commence during the second quarter
of 1985. The contracts for major equipment bid packages will include installa-



- 21 -
tion and commissioning of equipment.
3.15     Technical Assistance.  To simplify management of TA, the MOE would
obtain expert services and fellowships as a comprehensive TA contract selected
in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants." Terms
of reference for the TA were reviewed at negotiations. Prior Bank review
would be required of the proposed contract for the TA package under the
proposed project. The TA program would be carried out within the time
schedule proposed in the Technical Assistance Implementation Schedule shown in
Annex 5. Experts would be assigned for periods between three and twelve
months.
Procurement
3.16     Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below;

3.17     Contracts for construction of the project institutions (total
USS18.65 million including contingencies) to be financed under the loan would
be awarded on the basis of ICB in accordance with Bank guidelines. During
negotiations, the Bank was advised that successful foreign bidders for civil
works, equipment and furniture contracts would be required to register in the
Commercial Register, be categorized by the Ministry of Public Works and have
an Omani local agent to carry on business in Oman. The Government has
confirmed that these formalities are confined to the successful bidder and
that prior registration, categorization and appointment of a local agent are
not required in order to participate in ICB. In addition, registration



- 22 -
formalities for successful bidders in the project will be processed quickly
and will not delay project implementation. Prior Bank review of procurement
documentation and contract award recommendation would be required for all
civil works contracts.
3.18     Equipment and furniture needs (total US$2.94 million including
contingencies) would be grouped to the extent possible in large packages
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$50,000 or more each. Prior Bank review
of procurement documentation and contract award recommendation would be
required for all equipment and furniture contracts awarded on the basis of
ICB. TA financed under the loan would be selected in accordance with Bank
Guidelines (para. 3.15). The exceptions to ICB procurement of furniture and
equipment, which would not exceed an aggregate total of US$0.3 million
equivalent (about 10% of the estimated furniture and equipment costs,
including contingency allowances), would be as follows: contracts for small
items, or groups of items estimated to cost less than US$50,000 equivalent or
items which the Bank agrees are of a specialized nature for which ICB is not
practical, would be awarded 'ith procedures agreed with the Bank, on the basis
of evaluation and comparison of quotations solicited from at least three
reputable suppliers.
Disbursements
3.19     The proposed loan would be disbursed over a period of six years as
shown in Annex 9. Disbursements would be on the basis of:
(a) Civil works: 59% of total expenditures;
(b) Equipment and furniture: 100% of foreign expenditures, 100% of local
expenditures (ex-factory cost) and 90% of local expenditures for
other items procured locally; and
(c) Technical assistance; 80% of total expenditures.
Withdrawal applications for contracts financed by the loan would be fully
documented. To facilitate timely withdrawal of the proceeds of the loan, the
Borrower would open, maintain and operate a special account with the Central
Bank of Oman or a commercial bank acceptable to the World Bank on terms and
conditions satisfactory to the Bank. The initial deposit would be about
US$0.75 million equivalent. Opening of the special account would be a special
condition of effectiveness.
3.20     Implementation Schedule.  The loan would be fully disbursed in about
six years (1984-1990) in accordance with the schedule of disbursements in
Annex 9. This compares with the EMENA regional profile for all projects of
eight and a half years. The number of ongoing and completed projects in Oman
(six in total) is well below the required number (30) to produce a
statistically significant country profile. Disbursement estimates are
therefore based on the known strong performance of the MOE Projects Department
in implementing the first education project, which was closed on schedule in

therefore based on the known strong performance of the MOE Projects Department
in implementing the first education project, which was closed on schedule in
June 1980 after five and a half years, with loan disbursements completed after
four and a half years, about one year ahead of Bank appraisal estimates. In
addition, the proposed project is in a reasonable advanced state of
preparation (para. 3.13), which would permit construction to begin within one
year of loan effectiveness (Annex 8).
3.21     Accounts and Audits.  The Projects Department would establish a
separate project account, as was done for the first education project. The
maintenance of the first education project account was orderly and systematic
and the submission of withdrawal applications generally timely and complete.
3.22     During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that accounts
for the proposed project, including the special account, would be audited each
year by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank and in accordance with
appropriate auditing principles; and the Bank would be furnished, within six
months of the end of each fiscal year, with certified copies of the audit
report.

IV. BENEFITS AND RISKS
Benefits
4.01     The main benefits expected from implementation of the proposed
project are as follows;
(a) Planning, Cost Control and Management. The project would contribute
to the institutional development of the MOE by enhancing the MOE's
planning, cost control and management capability through the
introduction of improved planning, cost accounting and management
techniques;
(b) Teacher Training. The proposed TTI would improve the quality of
primary and preparatory schooling by alleviating the acute shortage
of Omani primary and preparatory school teachers. By 1989, it would
contribute about 110 teachers annually, increasing the annual output
of trained Omani teachers by about 18%. The emphasis on multisubject
and multigrade teaching would promote an efficient and economical use
of teachers within primary and preparatory education. The location
of the TTI would improve the regional distribution of teacher
training resources;
lc) Female Education and Training. The proposed girls' secondary school
and girls' commercial school would increase education and training
opportunities for girls and facilitate female participation in the
labor force and in higher education. The girls' secondary school
would increase female secondary school capacity by about 11%. The
girls' commercial school would provide for the first time skill
training opportunities for girls at the secondary level; and
(d) Development of Secondary Schooling. As well as the benefits
described in para. 4.01(c) above, the project would increase the
quantity and quality of secondary schooling. The proposed boys'
secondary school would increase male secondary school capacity by
about 5%. The project would improve the quality of secondary general
and specialized schooling by assisting with curriculum and staff
development in science teaching, technical and commercial education.
Risks
4.02     There are no undue risks anticipated with the proposed project.
Project components are well prepared and the MOE has the necessary
implementation capacity, which will be further strengthened by the appointment
of additional professional staff.  All project components are high priority
