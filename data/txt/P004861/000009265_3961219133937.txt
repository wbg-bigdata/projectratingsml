Implementation Completion Report
Preface
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the
Telecommunications Project in Western Samoa for which Credit 2034-WSO in the
amount of SDR 3.6 million (US $4.6 million) was signed on August 2, 1989. The
project was cofinanced in the amount of US $7.4 mililion by the Asian Development
Bank (ADB), under their Loan Agreement No. 960 SAM (SF) signed on June 30,
1989. The original closing date of the IDA Credit was December 31, 1992. It was
extended to June 30, 1994 to enable adjustments to project works, and related
contractual payments, for restoring damages to the local line and transmission
networks from the Val cyclone of December 1991. The credit account was closed
on September 30, 1994, and an undisbursed balance of SDR 1,810.00 was cancelled.
Under an agreement of November 8, 1989 between the International
Development Association (IDA) and the ADB, the ADB was responsible for the
administration, monitoring and supervision of the implementation of the project, as
well as for preparation of the Project Completion Report. IDA contributed to
supervision for its part of the project in particular with regard to the impact of the
Val cyclone on the project components financed by IDA, which mainly covers the
outside plant for local networks and trunk links.
This Implementation Completion Report (ICR) consists of an evaluation
summary prepared by IDA staff, and a complete Project Completion Report (PCR)
prepared by staff of the ADB subsequent to an ADB project completion review
mission in August 1995. The ADB loan closed on December 31, 1994, following
three extensions of the original closing date of December 31, 1992 to enable
completion of all project components.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
Summary from IDA's Perspective
Introduction
1.       Sectoral Background.  The geographical dispersion of the Pacific Islands
countries, their isolation, and the proportion of the population living in rural areas contribute
to the importance for the social and economic activities and development in these countries
of establishing adequate and effective internal and international communications. In 1986,
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) funded the preparation of a Master Plan
by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) for the future development of
telecommunications in Western Samoa.  The ITU  plan concluded that the existing
telecommunications network was highly insufficient to meet current and future demand for
service and that existing facilities, which were close to the end of their effective working life,
could not be expanded, or upgraded, to meet the backlog of demand for connections and the
expected future growth, or even to maintain an acceptable quality of service. In the absence
of new investment, as defined in the plan, the resulting further congestion and lack of
capacity would inhibit the country's development and socio-economic activities, in both the
private and public sectors. The Government of Western Samoa (GOWS) adopted the Master
Plan as the basis for setting the objectives and a short-term program for telecommunications
development under the country's Sixth Development Plan (DP6: 1988-1990). In 1988,
GOWS requested assistance from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and IDA in financing
said program and its implementation. ITU was also requested to continue its support in
planning and procurement activities under the program.
2.       Project preparation, appraisal, and costs. The project was prepared in 1988 on
the basis of ITU's short-term program under the Master Plan. It was jointly appraised by the
ADB and IDA in January 1989. Project costs were estimated to be US$16.3 million. The
financing arrangements, in 1989 US$ equivalent, were: ADB - US$7.4 million; IDA -
US$4.6 million, and ITU - US$0.1 million for the foreign costs component.  The
Government's Posts and Telecommunications Department (PTD) would provide US$4.2
million for local costs. In conjunction with the project, ADB approved an advisory technical
assistance (TA) grant of US$0.46 million for consulting services in areas such as sector
institutions and law, and PTD's commercial organization, finance and accounting. For
international communications, the European Community (EC) also agreed in 1992, to finance
a Satellite Earth Station (SES) to replace the obsolete existing station, part of which had been
damaged by the Val cyclone in December 1991. SES was a separate operation from the
project.

3.       Implementation Arrangements. In November 1989, ADB and IDA concluded an
agreement for ADB to administer the IDA credit together with its own loan for the project,
and take the lead responsibility in project monitoring and supervision, in close consultation
and cooperation with IDA.  The establishment, at project inception in early 1990, of a
Project Implementation Office with a suitably qualified Project Manager financed by the
ADB loan and self-standing procurement packages for the main types of project components
had been agreed upon during appraisal, with the view to ensure prompt project start-up. The
Project Manager performed satisfactorily, and his contract, financed by the ADB loan, was
extended for the entire project implementation period through to the end of 1994.
Project Objectives and Description
4.    Project Objectives.   The main objective of the project was to finance priority
investments to upgrade the telecommunications networks, build a basis for its future
expansion, and lay the groundwork for the development of rural telecommunications. The
project would also assist the Government by formulating and implementing modifications in
the institutional, policy and regulatory environment for telecommunications; and strengthen
PTD's project implementation and operations and maintenance (O&M) capacities by
strengthening and training its human resources.
5.       Summary of Project Description.  Project components included provision for:
(a) telephone exchanges for about 3,300 new subscriber lines in the country's capital city of
Apia and four other cities (Asau, Faleasiu, Lufilufi, and Salelologa); (b) digital microwave
links between Apia and the new exchanges; (c) upgrading and expanding subscriber cable
networks (outside plant) in each exchange area; (d) vehicles, ancillary equipment and spare
parts; (e) establishing a training school; and (f) consultants to carry out technical assistance
and training for sector policy development, institution building, project implementation, and
utility operations.
6.       The project objectives were realistic and in line with GOWS's sectoral objectives
and strategy discussed with IDA and ADB within the Sixth National Development Plan, with
the view to enlarge the coverage of quality telecommunications services in the country, to
encourage self-sufficiency, and greater autonomy in their operation and to seek a long-term
reduction in the sector's dependence on foreign assistance. Project components were well
prepared and feasible in the then sectoral context and capability.
7.       The IDA credit covered the upgrading and expansion of subscriber cable and
overhead line networks and outside plant in the exchange areas, the provision of digital
microwave links between Apia and new exchanges, with related ancillary equipment, spare
parts and maintenance devices. The ADB loan covered switching equipment with operation
and maintenance facilities, and the technical assistance (TA) and consultant activities for
project implementation, utilities operation and management, and institution building. In
1990, an Advisory Technical Assistance grant of US$460,000 was also provided by ADB for
additional consultancy services in such areas as financial management, accounting and law.
ADB was also responsible for administration and supervision of project implementation.

Implementation Experience and Results
8.       Project Implementation started and proceeded smoothly under the Project Office
and with the assistance of consultants - the ITU expert for component planning and
procurement; and the Project Manager. Detailed planning of some systems, in particular the
local networks (outside plant) and microwave installations, required some redesign to fulfill
local environmental conditions. This resulted in an initial delay of about six months
compared to the original schedule. Tenders for the main packages, however, were issued and
evaluated in 1990 and the related contracts were signed by June 1991, or about six months
behind schedule.
9.       Project Supervision. In accordance with the Letter of Credit Administration
agreed between ADB and IDA at project inception. ADB had the lead responsibility in
project supervision and monitoring of its implementation. ADB's PCR indicates that 10
review missions were fielded during the 6 year project period. (Appendix I to ADB's PCR).
Copy of the reports from these visits and relevant action letters were communicated to IDA
on a regular basis. IDA fielded four review missions under the project, in May and
November 1990, June 1991 and March 1992. Two missions were common with ADB's
visits and two independent. The 1990 missions took place at project start-up when the results
from the tendering process were available and contracts were initiated. The two other
missions were follow-ups to the December '90 and December '91 cyclones to assess the
damages to the networks and adjust the project scope so that the project could ensure, at same
total cost, network rehabilitation and the provision of expanded outside plant facilities to
enable connection of additional switching capacities which could be procured under the ADB
loan. (See paras. 10 and 11.)
10.      Factors that Affected Project Implementation. Overall project implementation
was affected by two major exogenous factors: (a) the reduced cost of digital telephone
exchange equipment attributable to important reductions in the world market prices for this
equipment between the times when the cost estimates were approved and the equipment was
procured; and (b) two cyclones which hit the country in 1990 and 1991, causing severe
damage to the telecommunications infrastructure, in particular to outside plant, radio towers
and the satellite earth station, and at some locations, exchange buildings and equipment.
Cyclone Val, in December 1991, disrupted 70 percent of the telephone lines in service and
silenced all international and between islands communications.
11.      Change in Project Scope. The above factors resulted in an adjustment of the
project scope in order to sustain its objectives and at the same time rehabilitate and reinstate
the networks and services damaged by the cyclones. The important savings on the switching
installations and from adjustment of the mechanical plant and operational support items were
allocated to: (a) additional digital switching equipment to provide 4,000 more lines,
including replacement of an old mechanical exchange in Apia; (b) expanded outside plant to
restore the plant damaged by the cyclones in 1990 and 1991, and to produce additional lines
fitting the new exchange facilities; and (c) reinforced structures for the microwave links for
cyclone safety and possible emergency stand-by equipment in the future. The change in



4
project scope was possible with minimal delay (estimated 6 months) and adjusted
procurement took place on the basis of tenders for the initial scheme. This resulted from the
flexibility and adequacy of the cofinancing and implementation arrangements for the project.
In particular, the IDA-financed contracts for outside plant installations had been designed for
complete construction of the initially planned capacities and were adjustable to evolving or
growing demand in the local line networks.
12.      Project Costs and Plhysical Results.  The actual cost of the project, including
expanded facilities and rehabilitation works from cyclones' damages, was US$15.9 million,
compared with the estimated US$16.3 million at appraisal.   Benefitting from  the
technological changes in the sector and the related price reductions observed worldwide in
the 1990's, the project resulted in about 7,000 new exchange and outside plant capacities for
the local networks in five cities. These included the 3,300 new lines which were initially
planned and 3,700 additional lines, of which about 1,200 were for replacement of obsolete
mechanical exchange equipment. Long distance traffic capacity, reliability, quality of service
and operation and maintenance (O&M) capabilities also greatly improved, benefitting from
homogenous modem technology throughout the network.   The project met its overall
objectives of developing cost effective modem facilities and its physical achievements and
results were beyond its original targets: switching capacities were provided to replace about
1,200 lines of obsolete equipment, and to provide up to 5,800 new connections, together
with substantial works to rehabilitate about 50 percent of previously working capacities. Of
these new facilities, 1,600 already provided service to new subscribers at project completion.
13.      Project Schedule. The expanded project was virtually completed in December
1994, with an overall two-year delay from the initial schedule. The project was substantially
completed by March 1993 for the main installations (telephone exchanges and transmission
links). The completion of minor items such as local lines for the connection of additional or
restored subscribers, public telephones and the computerized accounting system was further
delayed due to late procurement (ADB's PCR, para.8).
14.      Financial and Economic Results.  ADB's PCR presents a detailed financial
evaluation of the project results. The financial and economic internal rates of return (FIRR
and EIRR) were recalculated as follows: 20 and 25 percent, compared to appraisal estimates
of 27 and 34 percent, respectively. The lower rates are not alarming with regard to the
project results and its likely sustainability, due to the circumstances of project
implementation where assets were both replaced or repaired, and/or expanded, including
those for international telecommunications. These latest installations have high return and
sensitive traffic and were replaced at the very end of the project, thus, not being fuilly
accounted for in the recalculations of the returns. These, also, did not include the estimated
consumer surplus in economic evaluation. The rate of return on net fixed assets was
tentatively estimated to be about 9 percent, which is slightly higher than the covenanted 8
percent on revalued fixed assets, though very little improvement of PTD's financial
management and accounting system took place and no assets revaluation had been made
during the project period. The reestimated FIRR was based on assessed weighted average
cost of capital in real terms (ADB's PCR, paras. 25 and 26).

15.      Borrower Performance.  The performance of the Borrower (GOWS), the
Executing Agency (Treasury Department), and the Implementing Agency (PTD) has been
acceptable for the physical implementation of the Project, but it has been inadequate in
respect to the institutional and organization strengthening aspects. The Project Management
Office was established in due course enabling early effectiveness of the IDA credit and ADB
Loan. A qualified Project Manager (a consultant financed under ADB's loan) was assisted
with suitable technical staff to prepare, direct and supervise project implementation, but staff
turnover and repeated changes, and minimal administrative and secretarial support, generally
hampered or delayed implementation. With regard to institutional improvement, inspite of
the outside assistance from the project and under ADB's TA grant in conjunction with their
loan, no improvement of PTD's financial management, no introduction of commercial
accounting system, nor decision on the sector restructuring and PTD's corporatization
materialized.
16.      Compliance with Covenants. The compliance with the covenants under the IDA
credit and ADB loan, which were parallel, is detailed in Annex 5, and paragraphs 12 to 18 of
ADB's PCR. Despite the efforts during project supervision and frequent reminders, PTD and
the Government have not complied with most credit/loan covenants related to PTD's
financial management and performance, commercial accounting, internal control, auditing,
accounts receivable, and to its institutional strengthening. Also, no firm schedule for PTD's
corporatization and overall sector restructuring were indicated or decided upon, though the
project's covenants included a summary schedule for PTD's commercialization and
reorganization on the basis of the studies from the project. Also, PTD's system of
commercial accounting and internal control were not satisfactorily introduced. External
auditing of PTD's departmental account would not have been particularly useful. The
project, thus, did not achieve its objectives of institutional strengthening and sector reform.
17.      The Borrower did not prepare a Project Completion Report (PCR). At ADB's and
Government request, the Project Manager attempted to compile such report but could do it
only partially, because of the lack of details on project expenditures and other related
information (ADB's PCR, para.15).
Findings and Lessons Learned
18.      The Project met its main development objective to upgrade and expand the
country's telecommunications network and to build a basis for future expansion, also laying
ground for the development of rural telecommunications. Eventually, this objective was met
beyond original targets, together with the rehabilitation/replacement and upgrading of
installations destroyed or damaged by two cyclones during the project period. These actions
could be combined through adequate adjustments to the on-going actions and works under
the project, also benefitting from the cooperation between the main cofinancing agencies and
the beneficiary, and from the arrangements for project implementation.
19.      By ceding project administration to the ADB, the main cofinancier under the
project, IDA intended to obtain some operational simplification and resource savings, and
also prevent duplication of activities in the implementation of a relatively small project for



6
utilities type infrastructure, in a very distant location. These savings principally materialized
at the appraisal and completion stages of the project. Due to circumstances - two cyclones at
the beginning of project implementation and the need to review and adjust the project scope
on account of these events and of the technological evolution in the sector - the IDA
supervision and cooperation activities under the credit were about the same as those for a
similar project directly administered. No difficulties were observed in the procurement
process due to the adequacy of the packages agreed upon between the cofinancing agencies.
IDA was not in a position to exercise upstream quality control in the process, but the
flexibility of the distribution of the items to be procured enabled suitable adjustments and
changes, thus making possible an advantageous and successful completion of the various
material components.
20.      One point to stress is that, as a whole, the project benefited from new technologies
and the falling cost of sophisticated telecommunications installations during the implemen-
tation period. This was to the project's and country's advantage.
21.      With regard to the deferment and lack of progress in achieving the project
objectives of institutional strengthening and sector reform and meeting the related covenants,
it would have been opportune that the three main cofinanciers -- ADB and IDA under the
project and the EC for the satellite earth station - consult among themselves and with the
Government/PTD, for example in early or mid- 1993, to review the situation and to develop a
modified plan of action to analyze the causes and prevent, or moderate, the risk of such lack
of progress. In particular, government authorities should have been pressed to involve
themselves in a more active and timely way in the process of reorganizing and strengthening
the telecommunications operator, of resolving the very important matter of
clients/government accounts receivables, and in initiating or taking steps to restructure the
sector. ADB relates the deferment of actions in this field to the fact that PTD is unable to
attract or retain well qualified staff for its positions because of the Public Civil Service statute
of its staff. (ADB's PCR, paras.27 and 28.) The repeated extensions, virtually to project
completion, relate to such weakness, among other facts, and combined with the
circumstances of the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the networks which had been
heavily destroyed by two cyclones. Following project completion, GOWS and PTD could
usefully have to be reminded of the importance of these managerial and organizational
components of the project and strongly encouraged to soon decide upon the sector reform
measures which were prepared and recommended.
22.      Necessary improvements in the above areas are important for ensuring the longer
term sustainability and suitable future operation of the project beyond its highly satisfactory
physical results, and for the successful evolution of the telecommunications sector in support
of the country's social and economic development. However, in-depth sector reform and
management improvement of public sector entities which are traditionally combined in a
monopoly environment, such as posts and telecommunications in Western Samoa, is a
difficult, complex and slow process, which requires the active participation of all
stakeholders. This would justify that a thorough discussion of the case be initiated with the
Government on the basis of the work already done and the studies available. Implementation
of the required sector reform measures could take place, with adequate assistance, under a
feasible short-term action plan. The TA already provided could then bear its fruits.



7
23.       In the current context of PTD's operation, PTD's corporatization into an efficient
commercialized entity, and sector reform, would require extensive outside assistance and
management support, including adequate foreign expertise and experience in
telecommunications operations, such as under a management and staff training contract.
Such further assistance could be considered by the co-lenders who have already contributed
to the project. ADB has already indicated its willingness to consider additional TA to
facilitate PTD's corporatization and sector reform, thus enabling it to better meet the
project's objectives.
24.      Summary of Assessments.   On the whole, one may conclude that: (i) project
achievement of objectives was highly satisfactory for its physical but negligible for its
institutional parts;  (ii)  project sustainability is likely for its physical component but
uncertain for its institutional aspects; (iii) the performance of the lenders was satisfactory for
the supervision of physical construction but deficient in not sufficiently urging the Borrower
to commit itself to implement PTD's commercialization and sector reform, and assisting in
the process; and (iv) the performance of the Borrower (GOWS) and the implementing agency
(PTD) has been acceptable for the physical implementation of the Project, but has been
inadequate in respect of the institutional restructuring and strengthening aspects (ADB's
PCR, para. 27). As the main objective of the Ida component of the project is the upgrade of
the telecommunications network, the overall assessment of the project's outcome is
satisfactory. Appropriate ways for meeting the unmet institutional and organizational
objectives of the project could be further discussed between GOWS and the interested
project's co-financiers (paras. 22 and 23). The attached table summarizes the assessments of
the project.

GLOSSARY
DEL                    Direct exchange line, a telephone line connecting the
subscribers terminal equipment to the public switched
network, which has a dedicated port in the telephone
exchange equipment. Also known as a main or working
line.
Digital               The digital system  (where information is coded and
processed as on-off pulses so that it is immune from
electrical noise) envisaged for the switching and
transmission, which ensures superior quality of service in
urban and in rural areas, and involves low maintenance
but high reliability.
Microwave              Microwave radio transmitting and receiving equipment
operating generally in the frequency band above 1GHz
and capable of carrying, terrestrially, a large number of
telephone, data and video channels over long distances.
Older systems were analog - the system for the Project is
digital.
Outside Plant          Denotes  the  communication  cables  that  connect
telephone exchanges to the telephone subscribers. The
term refers to cables, poles conduits, underground ducts,
and all other materials required to connect subscribers to
the local telephone exchange.
UHF                    Ultra high frequency is a method of transmitting radio
signals that provides better transmission quality at smaller
propagation distances than HF.
WEIGHTS AND MEASURES
Hz (hertz)             Unit of frequency
GHz (gigahertz)        1,000,000,000 Hz

I. PROJECT DESCRIPTION
A.    Objectives and Rationale
1.          The objective of the Project was to provide Western Samoa with a cost-effective
and reliable solution for its medium-term telecommunications requirements (until 2000) and
also provide for the low cost expansion of its telecommunications network in the longer term
(until 2010).
B.    Scope
2.          The major components of the Project included:t
(i)    a 3,000 line digital telephone exchange to supplement the existing Apia
exchange;
(ii)   three rural digital exchanges to replace existing manual exchanges;2
(iii)   one 250 line rural digital exchange at Lufilufi;
(iv)   a digital microwave radio system to link five telephone exchanges;3
(v)    upgrading and expanding subscriber cable networks (outside plant),
telephone instruments, and public telephones:
(vi)   a training facility and equipment;
(vii)  vehicles, mechanical equipment, computer hardware, and software; and
(viii)  engineering  consulting  services  for bid  evaluation  and  project
management.
II. EVALUATION OF IMPLEMENTATION
A.    Project Components
3.           The main events in the Project are listed in Appendix 1. There were four
significant changes in the scope: (i) an expansion of the digital telephone exchange in Apia
from 3,000 lines to 7,000 lines and the deletion of modifications to the existing crossbar
exchange (approved in December 1990); (ii) provision of additional outside cable plant, valued
at US$1.5 million, to restore outside plant damaged by a cyclone in February 1990 (approved
in March 1991); (iii) financing by the Bank of outside plant valued at US$0.6 million, originally
intended for International Development Association (IDA) financing (approved in October
1991): and (iv) provision of additional outside cable plant, valued at US$0.67 million, to restore

outside plant damaged by a cyclone in December 1991 and for minor expansion of the outside
plant network (approved in June 1992).
4.          The expansion of the digital telephone exchange in Apia by 4,000 lines cost an
additional USS0.55 million, but saved US$0.2 million if the existing crossbar exchange had
been modified as originally planned. The time schedule was not affected by this change. The
benefits of the change include a reduction in the inventory of spares and maintenance costs
for the old crossbar exchange and improvements in the reliability of the recording of the
customer billing data.
5.          The provision of additional outside plant at a total cost of about USS2.0 million
to restore plant damaged by cyclones in 1990 and 1991 was essential for the realization of the
full benefits of the Project. Without the restoration of the outside plant, a large proportion of
the capacity of the exchanges, outside plant, and microwave radio equipment provided under
the project would have been underutilized. The restoration of the outside plant resulted in
unavoidable delays that are directly attributable to the damage caused by the two cyclones.
The reallocation by the Bank of US$0.6 million of loan savings to finance a shortfall in IDA
financing for outside plant had no detrimental effect on the cost, benefits, or the time schedule
of this component. The Project has been designed to minimize damage caused by cyclones.
The cable for the outside plant is jelly-filled, which prevents water damage. The outside plant
is mostly underground and thus, is not affected by strong winds. The microwave towers have
been designed to withstand very strong winds.
B.    Implementation Arrangements
6.          As stipulated in the Loan Agreement, the Executing Agency was the Treasury
Department and the Implementing Agency was the Posts and Telecommunications
Department (PTD). PTD established a Project Office with a suitably qualified Project Manager,
financed by the loan, for the implementation of the Project. The Project Manager performed
satisfactorily. However, PTD only provided counterpart staff on a limited basis, resulting in a
minimal transfer of project management skills.
C.    Project Costs
7.          The actual cost of the Project is about USS15.93 million compared with the
estimated cost of USS16.3 million at appraisal, resulting in a cost underrun of US$0.37 million
(see Table). The main cost variations were: (i) an underrun of US$2.25 million because of the
reduced cost of digital telephone equipment attributable to reductions in the world market
prices for the equipment between the time of the cost estimates were approved and the
equipment was procured; (ii) an overrun of US$1.18 million in outside plant due mainly to the
costs of restoring the outside plant damaged by cyclones in 1990 and 1991; (iii) an underrun
of USS0.99 million in mechanical plant and vehicles because of the deletion of three items of
plant, the lower than estimated purchase prices, and the reducation in the rates of duties and
taxes; (iv) an overrun of US$0.79 million in microwave radio due mainly to an underestimate of
the number of towers required and their unit cost; and (v) an overrun in consulting services
because of an extension of project management services and the engagement of a financial
consultant. See Appendix 2 for a comparative summary of appraised and actual costs and
financing sources of the Project.

D.    Project Schedule
8.            At appraisal, it was estimated that the Project would take about three and one
half years and would be completed by June 1992 (see Appendix 3). It was substantially
compieted by March 1993, when the last of the small digital telephone exchanges was
commissioned  in Lufilufi.  However, minor items such as the computerized billing and
accounting system and public telephones were not completed until June 1994. Telephone
subscribers served by the Project were connected progressively, with substantial completion in
June 1994. Thus, there was a delay of about nine months in the installation of the major
components of the Project and a two year delay in the connection of the majority of
subscribers and procurement of minor items. The delay, which occurred on the critical path for
the completion of the Project, included a delay of about six months in the completion of system
design and tender documents by consultants, followed by a three month delay attributable to
restoration of damage caused by Cyclone Val in December 1991. The delays in completing
the minor items were caused by a delay in PTD procuring minor items, such as drop wire for
the connection of subscribers, and the need to procure new computer hardware and software
to provide sufficient capacity to process billing for the increased number of subscribers.
E.    Engagement of Consultants and Procurement of Goods and Services
1.     Engagement of Consultants
9.            PTCD  engaged  individual consultants to: (i) finalize the  specifications for
microwave radio, exchanges, and outside plant: prepare the related tender documents; and
evaluate the tenders (financed by International Telecommunication Union (ITU)): and (ii) the
management of the prolect (financed by the Bank). The Bank also approved a minor change
in scope to permit PTD to engage an accounting consultant to prepare overdue accounts and
financial statements for PTD.  The tender preparation and evaluation consultants were
engaged under ITU guidelines and the project management and accounting consultants were
selected and engaged in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines on the Use of Consultants.
The capacity of the existing billing system was inadequate to process effectively all the additional
subscriber accounts. Also, system and program support from ITU was withdrawn. The cost-effective
solution was to replace the billing software and provide upgraded hardware.

2.    Procurement of Goods and Services
10.          The procurement of goods and services financed by the Bank was carried out in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement and by the procurement methods
specified in the Appraisal Report, except that minor items were procured under direcLpurchase
rather than the planned intemational shopping (see Appendix 4). There were no significant
problems in procurement activities.
F.    Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
11.         The performance of the consultants', contractors, and suppliers was fully
satisfactory, except for relatively minor weaknesses in the performance of the supplier of the
billing and accounting software. The weaknesses in PTD in management and accounting are
the primary causes of the difficulty that PTD has experienced in operating the software
systems, while the software supplier has contributed to the problems by underestimating the
weakness in PTD's abilities.  However, there was no significant detrimental effect on
performance, implementation schedule, or costs of the Project.
G.    Conditions and Covenants
12.          The loan became effective on 22 September 1989, before the date specified in
the Loan Agreement. Despite the strenuous efforts of the Bank through frequent Review
Missions and reminders, PTD and the Government have not complied with a significant
number of loan covenants, particularly the covenants related to financial performance. The
Government has not restructured the sector as recommended by TA No.1163-SAM (see para.
30), thus the expected institutional strengthening of PTD has not occurred and the institutional
weaknesses in PTD have contributed to the Government not complying with many of the loan
covenants. The status of important covenants that have not been fully complied with are
discussed in the following paragraphs (see Appendix 5).
13.          The Borrower is required to maintain or cause PTD to maintain separate
accounts for the overall operations of PTD and for the Project and to submit related unaudited
financial statements to the Bank within three months and audited statements within nine
months after the end of each related fiscal year (Loan Agreement Section 4.06 (b)). PTD
financial statements for the financial years up to 30 June 1993, prepared by an accounting
consultant engaged under the loan, were submitted to the Bank one year or more past the
deadline. None of these statements have been audited, mainly because of the submission to
the Controller and Chief Auditor. Despite past technical assistance (TA), PTD has not yet
been able to prepare its financial statements for the year ended 30 June 1994.
14.         In early 1995, the Govemment submitted audited accounts for the Project for
the years 1990 to 1993, more than one year late. These accounts were incomplete in so far
as they did not indicated which costs, taxes and duties for the Project were financed by the
Govemment, nor did they provide detailed cumulative information about the costs financed by
the Bank and IDA. The covenants for submission of audited financial statements for the

engaged for the advisory technical assistance is discussed in para 30.

overall operations of PTD and for the Project are considered reasonable and necessary to
keep the Govemment and the Bank informed about the financial performance and condition of
the national telecommunications network.
15.        The Borrower was required to compile a Project Completion Report (PCR) and
submit it to the Bank within three months of the physical completion of the Project (Loan
Agreement Section 4.07(c)). At the request of the Govemment and the Bank, the Project
Manager attempted to compile a PCR. However, partly because of difficulties in obtaining
details of local expenditures for the Project, the Project Manager was able to produce only a
partial PCR. The Bank's requirement that the Borrower prepare a comprehensive PCR is
reasonable and necessary to analyze the costs and benefits of Bank-financed projects to the
Govemment.
16.         Prior to 1 January 1991, PTD was required to introduce a system of commercial
accounting and intemal control acceptable to the Bank (Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 4).
The PTD computerized accounting system and intemal accounting controls are not being
operated properly. The Bank's objective in encouraging improvements in PTD's accounting
systems and controls is justified in terms of achieving acceptable intemational accounting
standards. However, in terms of the limited accounting expertise available in the region and
the constraints on recruiting and retaining suitable staff because of low public service salaries,
the target date was ambitious.
17.         From January 1990, accounts receivable were not to exceed 45 days of billings
(Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para. 5). The level of receivables at 31 December 1994 was
equivalent to about 230 days of billings. This has been an ongoing problem caused by weak
credit control and the inability of PTD to reconcile the accounts receivable ledger with the
general ledger. Implementation of an improved credit policy formulated by PTD in 1994 would
result in a reduction of accounts receivable because of bad debts write offs and improved debt
collection. However, this policy has not been approved yet by the Govemment. Compliance
with this covenant is essential to ensure that users pay for the services provided by the Project
facilities. The limit of 45 days billings outstanding is considered appropriate for
telecommunications services.
18.         Prior to 31 January 1990, the Borrower, in conjunction with the consultants
under TA No.1 163-SAM, was to have reviewed the organization, institutional structure of PTD,
tariffs, and draft legislation and implementation procedures (Loan Agreement, Schedule 6,
para. 9). The Borrower's final decision on any proposal for the reorganization of PTD was to
be made no later than January 1991 (Loan Agreement, Schedule 6, para.1 1). The work of the
initial consultant firm under the TA was inadequate for the Govemment to make the necessary
decisions by the due date. However, reports prepared by subsequent individual consultants
under the TA provide an adequate basis for a decision. Although the organizational review
was necessary part of the institutional strengthening, the target date was ambitious given the
sensitive issues, such as sector's contribution to the national budget and redundant personnel,
which needed to be resolved by the Govemment. A review of PTD's tariffs is with the cabinet
for approval.
19.         The Mission analyzed the most recent unaudited financial statements of the
telecommunications operations of PTD (see Appendix 6, page 1). The analysis of the four
financial periods that ended on 30 June 1993, showed the return ranged from 40 percent to 80
percent on the historical cost of fixed assets. Although PTD fixed assets were not revalued as



6
required, it is estimated that PTD would have substantially exceeded the 8 percent on net
revalued fixed assets as required by the loan covenant.' A revaluation of PTD's fixed assets
would not substantially reduce the rate of return because the historical value is estimated to be
only slightly lower than the current replacement cost because the increase in the replacement
price of the majority of PTD's assets, mostly acquired during the past three years, has been
small. PTD has also achieved satisfactory operating ratios of between 34 percent and 53
percent during the period reviewed. The PTD financial ratios are forecast to decline from 1994
onwards because of the increase in depreciation expense as new fixed assets are
commissioned. An analysis of the PTD balance sheet indicates that most of the PTDs net
assets have been funded by long-term borrowings. The average Government equity in PTD's
telecommunications operations during the four financial periods is zero (see Appendix 6, page
2). This reflects the retention of a large proportion of PTD's cash revenues by the Govemment
to support the national budget. The retention by the Government of a high proportion of PTD's
revenues has resulted in inadequate maintenance of telecommunications facilities and has
delayed replacement of assets until well after their useful lives.
H.    Disbursements
20.         The first disbursement from the loan was made in May 1990, about nine months
later than expected at the time of appraisal.  There was an eighteen month lag in
disbursements throughout the implementation period, caused mainly by delays in awarding the
switching and outside plant contracts, the late delivery of equipment, and the effect of two
cyclones. The loan was closed on 8 March 1995, when the final disbursement was made (see
Appendix 7). The final disbursements were delayed because of the need for an accounting
expert and improved billing system to be financed from the loan.
I.    Environmental Impact
21.         As envisaged at appraisal, the Project did not have a significant adverse effect
on the local environment. The majority of the Project comprised rehabilitation and replacement
of existing facilities. Except in rocky terrain, all the cables are underground. The few
microwave radio towers are mostly located in remote areas.  Overall, the Project will have a
beneficial effect on the environment because it will provide additional energy efficient long-
distance telecommunications between the communities in the two main islands and reduce the
need to energy for air and sea travel. For example, the sale of primary produce from Savaii
can be arranged through a telephone discussion, instead of the grower travelling to Apia.
J.    Project Benefits
1.    Benefits and Beneficiaries
22.         Prior to the commissioning of the Project, which serves the capital, Apia, and
four rural centers, the telecommunications system was operating at full capacity and there was
a long waiting list of potential subscribers. Only 4,100 telephone subscribers were connected
to the analog automatic exchange in Apia, 215 subscribers were connected by manual
exchanges in three rural centers, and there were no telephone services in Lufilufi. The Project
has been successful in providing fully automatic digital telephone services to existing
Loan Agreement. Schedule 6, para.6, which requires the achievement of a rate of return of not less than 8
per cent on revalued net fixed assets.



7
subscribers and to an additional 3,130 subscribers in Apia and 1,020 subscribers in four rural
centers (see Appendix 8). The Project has also provided sufficient exchange capacity to
connect a further 500 subscribers by mid-1996. Because the radio systems and buildings
provided under the Project have sufficient capacity to about 2010, the system can be
expanded at a low incremental cost for additional switching and cables. By substantially
increasing the capacity and efficiency of the terrestrial telecommunications system, the Project
significantly increased the benefits derived by the expanded satellite earth station, financed by
the European Community, which commenced operations in November 1993. Because of the
Project, telecommunications penetration in Western Samoa has improved from 2.7 direct
exchange lines DEL per 100 population in 1988 to 4.7 DELs in 1995 (see Appendix 8).
23.         The national budget has also received a significant contribution from increased
PTD revenues and reduced PTD expenditures from the operation of the Project. These
contributions include: (i) the doubling of PTD cash revenues because the Project has doubled
the number of subscribers: and (ii) a reduction in the cost of maintenance requirements
because the Project facilities need lower maintenance.
24.         PTD has furnished annual updates on benefit monitoring and evaluation (BME)
indicators agreed at appraisal to the Bank (see Appendix 9). The BME indicators have been
useful in measuring the benefits of the Project by the people of Western Samoa, in terms of
telephone penetration and the reduction in frequency and duration of telephone service faults.
The reduced incidence of faults and the reduction in the number of PTD staff per 1,000 lines
reflect the efficiency gains resulting from the Project. Reports from subscribers indicate that
the quality of the service provided by PTD has improved significantly with the commissioning of
the Project. However, it is apparent that service quality could quickly deteriorate again if the
Govemment does not provide PTD with sufficient budget and staff to properly maintain the
telecommunications system. Also, institutional improvements in the administration of accounts
receivable and customer service are needed for subscribers to receive the full potential
benefits of the Project.
2.    Financial Evaluation
25.         The Mission recalculated the financial internal rate of return (FIRR) for the
Project based on: (i) actual capital cost of the Project plus a share of replacing and expanding
the international network: (ii) incremental operating revenues and costs up to June 1993; (iii)
projections, using assumptions similar to those used in the Appraisal Report, except the
Mission assumed that in the "without" the Project case, PTD would maintain its 1992 operating
capacity, whereas the appraisal assumed that there would be no telecommunications
operations after 1996; and (iv) constant 1994 prices (see Appendix 10). Based on the
foregoing methodology, the Mission reestimated the FIRR at 19.8 percent, compared with the
appraisal estimate of 27.3 per cent. The main reasons for the lower FIRR are: (i) the Mission
did not take as a benefit the forecast net operating revenues generated by the existing
telecommunications system because it was assumed existing operations would continue, albeit
inefficiently, "without' the Project; (ii) the forecast incremental operating costs include a
Government value-added goods and services tax on gross receipts from telecommunications,
less rebates -- this tax was not envisaged at appraisal; and (iii) the actual capital expenditure
for the Project expressed in tala was higher than estimated because depreciation of the
Western Samoa tala against the US dollar exceeded inflation and also the Mission allocated
part of the cost of expanding the international telecommunications network to the Project. The



8
reestimated FIRR exceeds the estimated weighted average cost of capital in real terms (about
9 percent) for the Project and is thus considered adequate.
3.    Economic Evaluation
26.         At appraisal, the economic internal rate of return (EIRR) was calculated on the
same basis as the FIRR, except that taxes and duties were removed. The PCR Mission
recalculated the EIRR on the same basis, except that it was necessary to also remove the
value-added goods and services tax in calculating the expenditures and the incremental
operating and maintenance costs for the Project. Based on this methodology, the Mission
reestimated the EIRR at 24.5 per cent (see Appendix 11), compared with the appraisal
estimate of 33.8 per cent. Because tariffs only indicate the value of the service to the marginal
consumer, this underestimates the true economic benefits of the Project.) The reasons for the
lower reestimated EIRR are the same as for the lower reestimated FIRR (see para. 25).
K.    Performance of Borrower, the Executing Agency, and the Implementing Agency
27.         The performance of the Borrower (Western Samoa), the Executing Agency (the
Treasury Department), and the Implementing Agency (PTD) has been acceptable for the
physical implementation of the Project, but it has been inadequate in respect to the institutional
strengthening aspects. In accordance with the provisions of the Loan Agreement,2 PTD
established a Project Management Office prior to the effective date of the loan and provided
suitable technical staff to assist the Project Manager, who was a consultant financed under the
loan. However, these technical staff were usually heavily burdened with other duties, did not
provide as much assistance to the Project Manager as they should, and have not
demonstrated that they have received technical knowledge. Furthermore, PTD provided only
minimal administrative and secretarial assistance. Because of the lack of PTD support for the
Project Manager, it was necessary to extend the term of his services to finalize the
implementation of minor contracts and the installation of computer billing and accounting
systems.  The Treasury Department processed the loan disbursement and procurement
documentation effectively, but it was slow to respond to the issues raised by Bank Review
Missions. The Appraisal Report accurately assessed the weakness of PTD and obtained
adequate assurances from the Government to address the issues. However, the Govemment
was not able to comply with many of these assurances and this is reflected in the large
proportion of loan covenants that have not been complied with.
28.         The need  for developing  and  implementing  improved  policies in the
telecommunications sector in Western Samoa and for substantial institutional strengthening of
PTD were accurately identified at appraisal. At the request of the Bank, prior to appraisal the
Government implemented organizational reforms and created additional management
positions (see AR, paras. 64 to 69). Subsequently, in December 1988, the Government
created a Telecommunications Steering Committee whose principal objective was to assist in
transforming PTD into a corporate entity. Furthermore, the Government agreed with the Bank
on a time-bound action plan for institutional development (see AR paras. 73 to 75 and
Appendix 8). The foregoing measures were supported by a Bank-financed advisory technical
1     Studies indicate that an economic evaluation factor of between 1.6 and 2.1 could be applied to the
financial revenues to derive an estimate of the economic benefits to subscribers.

assistance (TA) grant.1 The implementation of the TA was delayed, which contributed to the
difficulties the Government experienced in implementing sector reforms in and the institutional
development of PTD. However, the TA was successfully completed during the first half of
1995. Additional institutional assistance was provided to PTD under the loan by extending the
engagement of the Project Manager, financing an accounting consultant to update PTD's
accounts and providing substantial assistance with computerized billing and accounting
systems. Despite this assistance, the PTD has not been strengthened since appraisal of the
Project.   The management is not commercially oriented, 'customer service needs
improvement', planning for the expansion and maintenance of the telecommunications system
is lacking, the maintenance of accounts, preparation of financial statements, and the status of
accounts receivable are seriously in arrears. PTD is unable to attract and retain adequately
qualified staff for its positions, mainly because of the restrictions by Public Service Commission
on remuneration and staff morale is low. It could be expected that many of the foregoing
problems could be resolved if PTD was corporatized and it was operated in a commercial
environment.
L.    Performance of the Bank
29.         The Bank acted promptly in approving contract documents and awards,
arranging the disbursements from the loan, and approving changes in the scope of the Project.
On average, about two Bank Review Missions were fielded each year. The changes in scope
were particularly important in expeditiously restoring cyclone damage and in assisting PTD in
accounting and billing advisory services, thus contributing to the efficient and effective
utilization of the loan.
M.   Advisory Technical Assistance
30.         In conjunction with the loan, the Bank approved an advisory technical
assistance (TA) grant for US$460,000 for consulting services in such areas as finance,
accounting, and law. The overall objectives of the TA were to: (i) assist PTD in developing a
system of commercially based accounting and computerizing of the billing and accounting
functions; and (ii) provide guidance to the Government on tariffs, regulatory, and institutional
reforms and strategies; and an action plan for implementation. The firm of consultants
engaged for the TA carried out their assignment between November 1989 and July 1992. The
consultants did not submit the required draft final report and their final report did not meet the
requirements of the terms of reference.  Assistance to PTD to computerize billing and
accounting functions was provided from the loan. The Treasury Department and PTD
attempted to prepare for corporatization using their own resources, but they did not have the
expertise required. In late 1994, the Bank engaged individual consultants to rectify and
complete the critical tasks of the TA. The individual consultants issued their final reports
between February and April 1995. These reports are sound and provide sufficient guidance
on sector reforms, the financial impact on the national budget, the legal requirements, and the
time frame for corporatization. As of October 1995, the Government has not provided
comments to the Bank on the consultants' reports, nor have they indicated a firm schedule for
corporatization. Although completion of the TA was delayed by about two years, because of
shortcomings in the performance of the consultant firm, the final result was satisfactory and
met the objectives of the TA. The Bank could not have avoided the failure of the consultant
TA No. 1163-SAM: Institutional Strengthening of PTD, for USS460,000, approved on 1 June 1989 (see
para. 30).

firm to adequately carry out the study. While the Bank could have terminated the contract with
the consultant, the assurances given to the Bank and to the Government by the consultant to
improve their performance justified the opportunity which the Bank gave the consultant to
perform.
Ill. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A.   Conclusions
31.         The Project met its main objective of developing cost-effective reliable modem
telecommunications facilities for the immediate and medium-term telecommunications
requirements of Western Samoa and provide a low-cost means for future expansion of the
telecommunications  network.   The improvement in communications has facilitated
development in the rural areas and has supported the development of commerce. The Project
has been implemented essentially as conceived at appraisal.
32.         The TA did not achieve its objectives of institutional strengthening and sector
reform. Subject to the Government taking the initial steps to corporatize PTD and making a
commitment to complete the process in accordance with a firm implementation timetable, the
Bank has indicated its willingness to consider further TA to facilitate corporatization and sector
reform.
B.   Recommendations
1.    Project Related
33.         Future Monitoring and Covenants. The facilities provided under the Project
are operating efficiently and need not be monitored. Because the majority of the financial loan
covenants have not been complied with, an annual review of outstanding covenants should be
carried out by Bank Missions for other projects in Westem Samoa. Submission by the
Government of outstanding audited financial statements and compliance with accounts
receivable and sector and institutional reform covenants are important to the achievement of
the sector reforms envisaged at appraisal.
34.         Further Action and Additional Assistance. Because the Project is physically
complete and the loan is fully disbursed, no further implementation action is required.
However, it is recommended that the Govemment provide PTD with additional assistance for
accounting, from local or foreign consultants, for the proper maintenance of accounts, the
preparation of financial statements, an improvement in the accounts receivable records and
more efficient debt collection. Additional TA for corporatization of PTD is also recommended.
35.         Timing of Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) preparation.  The
PPAR may be prepared immediately.
2.    General
36.         Project Appraisal. The  Project Completion  Review  Mission  has no
recommendations about the appraisal, which was comprehensive and efficient. Appropriate



11
TA for institutional strengthening was provided to rectify the known weaknesses. However, the
extent of the institutional problems that became apparent during implementation could not be
expected to be foreseen by the appraisal.
37.         Project Implementation. The Executing and Implementing Agencies should
provide adequate full-time staff to assist the Project Office and to facilitate the transfer of
project management skills. The Project Completion Review Mission does not.have any
recommendations about the implementation of the Project. which was adequately supervised
with regular reviews.

REESTIMATED FINANCIAL INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN
UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
1.          The financial internal rate of return (FIRR) was reestimated using a methodology
similar to that in the Appraisal Report viz. a comparison of the financial costs and benefits
streams 'with' and 'without" the Project. The major assumptions and methodology are:
2.          All components of the FIRR calculations are expressed in constant end-1994
prices.
3.          The expenditures on the Project include all actual capital expenditures (adjusted
to 1994 prices) on the components, but exclude service charge during construction.
Expenditures also include a share of the cost of the expanded replacement satellite earth
station constructed during 1992 and 1993, allocated in proportion to the number of subscribers
served by the Project.  The Project would not have been able to achieve its potential
intemational revenue benefits without the earth station. In 1996, a saving in the cost of
replacing the 4,000 line telephone exchange in Apia has been ascribed to the Project because
the 4,000 lines were replaced as a component of the Project.
4.          The incremental revenue estimates for the Project are based on actual
revenues for 1992 to 1993 (accurate revenue data was not available for 1994) and forecasts
thereafter. Incremental revenues comprise: (i) billings of the incremental subscribers served by
the Project; and (ii) a share of inpayments from overseas telecommunications administrations
for overseas telephone and telefacsimile calls allocated in proportion to the number of
subscribers served by the Project. The appraisal assumed that the telecommunications
system and associated assets which existed in 1989 would cease operation in 1996 and,
therefore, ascribed all traffic and operating revenue to the Project. The PCR Mission
considered that it would be more likely that the existing system and subscribers would be
maintained by means of equipment repairs and replacements during the evaluation period
and, therefore, ascribed only the revenues from incremental subscribers to the Project.
5.          In calculating future revenues it has been assumed that: (i) 1994 tariff levels will
be gradually reduced over the life of the Project by 10 per cent cumulative in real terms; and
(ii) the number of subscribers served by the Project will grow by 12 percent between mid-1995
and mid-1996, when the capacity of the facilities provided under the Project is expected to be
fully utilized. No growth in subscribers has been assumed from 1997 onwards.
6.          The incremental operating expenditure for the Project has been estimated on
the basis of the following: (i) incremental labor, repairs and maintenance, and other operating
expenditures were estimated and a share was allocated to the Project in proportion to the
number of subscribers served by the Project; and (ii) 10 percent value added goods and
services tax, rebated by 50 percent, on incremental revenue.
7.          The expenditures on the Project include the regular replacement of computer
