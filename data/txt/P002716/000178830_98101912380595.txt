I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Tanzania has approached the Bank/IDA to help
finance (a) a textile project at Morogoro, an industrial town (pop. 40,000)
200 km west of Dar-es-Salaam, and (b) a technical assistance program to
improve capacity utilization in the existing five Government-owned textile
mills in Tanzania. The proposed Morogoro Textile Project will have an annual
production capacity of about 21.5 million square meters (sq/m), equivalent to
19 million linear meters (lm), of blended fabrics. It will help the country
meet the growing demand for such fabrics which has been created by their
higher durability, and easy-care properties compared to all-cotton fabrics.
This project gill be the second textile project financed by the Bank in
Tanzania. The first one (TA-1128), an expansion project to increase the
annual capacity of the Mwanza Textiles Ltd. (MWATEX) by 22 million sq/m to
47 million sq/m of cotton fabrics, is being implemented satisfactorily within
the budget and is expected to be commissioned in July 1978, about four months
behind the original schedule mainly because of delays caused by inland trans-
portation of equipment and construction materials. The Mwanza project is
being financed jointly by the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development and
the Bank, each providing US$15 million in loans.
1.02      The total financing required for the proposed project is estimated
at about T Sh 887 million (US$106.9 million equivalent) including T Sh 563
million (US$67.8 million) in foreign exchange. Bank Group financing of US$45
million -- US$20 million from the International Development Association (IDA)
and US$25 million from the Bank -- would cover about 42% of the total financ-
ing required for the project. The remainder will be met by funds from the
Government, Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB), and bilateral credits.
1.03      The types of fabrics that would be produced by the proposed mill
are increasingly in demand throughout the country. Already, the demand for
blended fabrics, especially polyester/cotton blends, is not limited to higher-
paid city dwellers and public servants but embraces urban and rural people
alike who prefer blended fabrics in work clothes, school uniforms, etc.
This preference is explained by the fact that blended fabrics are two to three
times more durable than pure cotton fabrics and have easy care properties.
Blended fabrics do not get soiled easily and, if they do, they are easier to
wash than pure cotton fabrics. As a result of the above mentioned properties
and the lower waste factor of man-made as compared to cotton fibers in textile
production, blended fabrics are considered the most economical means of
clothing a nation (as detailed in para 8.06).
1.04      The project will be implemented by the National Textile Corporation
(TEXCO), a parastatal organization which is fully owned by the Government and
is responsible for the development of the textile sector. The project is part
of an overall plan of Tanzania to reduce imports by achieving self-sufficiency
in essential consumer items like textiles. It was identified by Gherzi Textil
Organisation, of Switzerland, in its textile market study which was financed
under the Bank loan for the Mwanza project. The market review was followed



- 2 -
by a feasibility study for the project which was completed by Gherzi in early
June 1977. A preappraisal mission, consisting of Messrs. Y.T. Shetty (Chief),
Don Brown, H. Oteifa and W. Wipplinger of the Industrial Projects Department
was carried out in June/July 1977. This was followed by an appraisal mission
in October 1977; subsequent discussions with TEXCO in Washington in November
1977; and a follow-up mission consisting of Messrs. Y.T. Shetty and S. Greig
in February 197.3.
II. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
A.   Industrial Development
2.01      At the time of independence in 1961, Tanzania had a rudimentary
inclustrial sector, with total manufacturing value added accounting for less
than 5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP). The industries were largely owned
by foreigners and concentrated on processing of export items such as cotton,
sisal and coffee, with cotton ginning being the largest single manufacturing
activity.
2.02      Post-independence industrial policies have increasingly focussed
on import substitution. Perhaps the strongest boost to industrial development
came after the Arusha Declaration of 1967 in which the principles of Tanzanian
Socialism ("Ujamaa") and self-reliance were set forth. Pursuant to this new
orientation, existing major manufacturing plants were brought under newly-
established Government holding companies (parastatals) and those companies
became the leading investors in medium to larger scale industrial units.
In consumer goods industries, which account for over half of Tanzania's in-
dustrial output, production priorities were set mainly to meet the basic needs
of the population.
2.03      The growth of industry has been quite significant until 1973.
Between 1964, the beginning of Tanzania's First Five-Year Plan, and 1973, the
manufacturing secztor grew in real terms at an average annual rate of 9.4%,
starting from a small base. As a result, the share of the manufacturing
sector in GDP at current prices increased from nearly 7% in 1964 to 11.5% in
197.3. Reflecting the Government's concentration on import substitution,
nearly half of the total supply of manufactured goods in Tanzania was produced
locally in 1973. In consumer goods, which represented about 60% of total
output of medium and larger scale manufacturing firms (employing 10 or more
workers) in 1973., import substitution has been advancing fast.
2.04      After a decade of significant growth, however, the manufacturing
sect-or stagnated during 1974 and 1975 mainly because of steep increases in
the price of imported commodities (e.g., oil), an acute balance of payments
problem, extended drought, and shortages of water and power. The balance of
payments deficit increased from T Sh 942 million (US$113 million) in 1973
to T Sh 1,942 million (US$234 million) in 1974, despite higher world prices
for the country's; main export commodities such as cotton, sisal and coffee
that year. Faced with this situation, the Government reduced sharply the
imports of many products, including textiles, starting in 1975.



- 3 -
2.05      Since 1976, industry has been recovering from the economic crisis
period of 1973-75. This was mainly facilitated by increases in agricultural
output, and the removal of import restrictions on spare parts and important
industrial raw materials. As a result, in 1976, an industrial growth rate of
6.2% in real terms was achieved. Further, the balance of payments deficit
eased considerably in 1976 mainly due to the sharp rise in coffee export
prices. But this latter situation is probably unsustainable as the world
coffee prices have started falling and the full effects of the Government's
import liberalization program are being felt. Further, Tanzania's import
needs are increasing especially for oil and capital goods with the country's
plans for economic development. During 1977-85, GDP is projected to grow at
5.2% and industry by 8-9%; these rates are close to the historical annual
growth rates during 1964-1973. The Third Five-Year Plan (1977-1981) has
allocated T Sh 1,830 (US$624 million), about 27% of total development funds,
for industrial development.
B.   Parastatal Organizations
2.06      Larger-scale industrial facilities are mostly owned by the "para-
statal" organizations -- Government-owned holding companies operating under
the overall supervision of the Ministries concerned. Since 1967, nearly all
important industrial projects have been undertaken by the parastatals although,
in some cases, with minority private foreign investment participation.   In
1974, the parastatals accounted for an estimated 50% of manufacturing value
added and 50% of new capital formation. There are currently six parastatals
under the Ministry of Industry of which the National Textile Corporation
(TEXCO) is the second largest next to the National Development Corporation
(NDC).
2.07      The growth of public ownership of manufacturing enterprises since
1967 has been accompanied by increasing reliance on direct controls in alloca-
tion decisions. Components of the control system include centralized
decision-making on investments, detailed allocations of foreign exchange
through import licensing, a detailed regime of price controls operated by the
National Price Commission, credit allocation according to the annual Finance
and Credit Plan, and wage setting by the Permanent Labor Tribunal and the
Government. Imports of raw materials are channelled through state trading
corporations. Exports are also handled by government agencies.
C.   Textile Sub-Sector
2.08      As the third largest cotton producer in Africa, after Egypt and
the Sudan, Tanzania has a significant raw material base to expand textile
production. From about 440,000 ha of land under cotton, Tanzania currently
produces about 67,000 tons of cotton per year, of which about 15% is locally
processed into textiles, and the rest is exported mainly to Hong Kong,
the People's Republic of China and Japan. Tanzanian cotton commands a
premium in the export markets because of its superior quality.
2.09      The public sector has assumed the leading role in the development
of the textile industry since 1967, setting up some large-scale textile mills



- 4 -
and consolidating a few others.  As a result, the textile and clothing sector,
which was insignificant in the early Sixties, has become the largest individual
sub-sector and a major source of employment in the manufacturing field. In
1976, this sector accounted for 15% of total gross output, 20% of value added
and 30% of employment in manufacturing firms employing 10 or more workers.
The total employment in this sector is expected to increase by 50,000 to
72,000 during 1976-1986.
2.10      The domestic output of woven textiles, which was less than 10 mil-
lion sq/m in the early 1960's, expanded to about 91 million sq/m in 1974 but
declined in subsequent years because of problems in the existing mills (paras
2.12 and 3.08). In cotton textiles, which represent about 95% of total
domestic output of woven textiles, import substitution has progressed signi-
ficantly and near self-sufficiency is expected in the early 1980's. However,
regarding blended fabrics, import substitution has been slow.
2.11      There are at present seven textile mills in Tanzania:  (a) Friend-
ship Textile Mills Ltd. (URAFIKI), Dar-es-Salaam; (b) Kilimanjaro Textile
Corporation Ltd. (KILTEX) mills -- one located at Arusha and the other in Dar-
es-Salaam; (c) Mwanza Textiles Ltd. (MWATEX), Mwanza; (d) Tanganyika Dyeing
an,l Weaving Mills Ltd. (SUNGURATEX), Dar-es-Salaam; (e) Calico Textile Mills
Ltd, Dar-es-Salaam; and (f) Tanganyika Textile Industries Ltd. (TANTEX), Dar-
es-Salaam. Of the seven mills, five are in the public sector and two (CALICO
and TANTEX) are in the private sector. The private sector mills, with a pro-
duction capacity of 5.5 million sq/m of cloth, account for only 6% of the
total production capacity in the country and are operating efficiently.  In
addition, there are 38 garment manufacturing units each employing 10 people
or more. Most of them are private or cooperative enterprises which produce
2.8 million trousers, 2.2 million shirts and children's clothing items, among
other things.  The Government has recently established a new Government gar-
ment factory at Ubungo, near Dar-es-Salaam, as a TEXCO subsidiary with a
capacity to produce 500,000 trousers and 1 million pieces of ladies and
children's apparel.
2.].2     The textile sub-sector as a whole is experiencing management, tech-
nical, financial and manpower problems. These are particularly pronounced
in the TEXCO group of companies which accounts for 94% of the total annual
textile production capacity. The situation will be rectified under a number
of rehabilitaticn programs being carried out or to be carried out by the
TEXCO group of companies (paras. 3.09 to 3.14). In the garment industry, the
main problems are due to restrictions on imported shirtings and suitings of
polyester/cotton and polyester/rayon, forcing garment companies to produce at
reduced capacity and reduce the number of employees. Some companies have
converted to knitting operations for which the availability of imported raw
materials has not been a major constraint, as foreign exchange expenditure on
imports of yarn for knitting has been comparatively small and restrictions
were not imposed on such imports. The situation in the labor-intensive
garment industry is expected to improve with the local production of blended
fabrics under the proposed textile project.

2.13      The Agricultural and Industrial Supplies Company Ltd. (AISCO), a
state trading company, is in charge of the import of items such as dyestuffs,
chemicals, and fiber materials for the textile sub-sector. AISCO charges
10% commission on the c.i.f. value of such imports to meet its overhead costs,
including inland transportation and storage charges. Effective July 1, 1978,
companies in Tanzania, including those in the textile sector, will be allowed
to import their raw material requirements directly (where these are in excess
of T Sh 100,000 annually). The Government has agreed that in order to ensure
the efficient operation of the new company at Morogoro it would continue to
provide satisfactory arrangements for the timely procurement of imported raw
materials.
III. NATIONAL TEXTILE CORPORATION - THE EXECUTING AGENCY
A.   Role of TEXCO
3.01      In accordance with the general Government policy, major textile
companies have been gradually transferred to partial or full state ownership
since 1967. Most of them were first incorporated into the National Develop-
ment Corporation (NDC) as subsidiary or associate companies and, subsequently,
in January 1974, entrusted to the newly-established National Textile Corpora-
tion (TEXCO) which has its headquarters in Dar-es-Salaam. TEXCO is fully-
owned by the Government, and is the principal agency for the developmennt of
the textile industry in Tanzania. It was created as a separate parastatal
organization in view of the importance given by the Government to the textile
industry.  Initially for slightly more than two years TEXCO was responsible
for both production and marketing of textiles.  The marketing function, how-
ever, was transferred in February 1976 to the Tanzania Textile Trading Company
(TANZATEX), a separate parastatal organization.
3.02      Currently, TEXCO is the holding company for eight companies and
focusses its attention on general aspects of textile production, expansion and
pricing, as well as on the arrangement of funds and technical know-how for new
textile projects for which it acts as the executing agency. Its authorized
share capital is T Sh 500 million (US$60.2 million), of which T Sh 176 million
(US$21.2 million) is paid in.
3.03      TEXCO's nine-member Board of Directors functions as a policy making
and controlling body. The Board consists of an Executive Chairman, a Managing
Director, and seven directors. Mr. C. A. Kallaghe, formerly Ambassador to
Moscow, was appointed as Executive Chairman in February 1976. Mr. N. A.
Rweyemamu, 36, an experienced administrator, has been Managing Director since
the inception of TEXCO in 1974, and he was reappointed for a second three-year
term in 1976. Of the seven directors who were also re-appointed in 1976,
three have a three-year term and the rest have a two-year term. Among the
directors are: the Chairman and Managing Director of the Tanzania Investment
Bank (TIB); the Commissioner of Trade, Ministry of Trade; the Director of
Industrial Operations, Ministry of Industries; and the General Manager of
Friendship Textile Mill. Three other directors are members of Parliament.



3.04      Mr. Rweyemamu is responsible for the day-to-day operations of
TEXCO. He is supported by a professional staff of 20 (including one ex-
patriate) serving in four departments: Planning and Finance; Operations;
Development and Research; and Administration and Manpower. Because of acute
shortage of trained manpower in Tanzania, TEXCO has not been able to have
adequate professional staff to cope with its increasing responsibilities for
the development of the textile sub-sector. To overcome this constraint, as
discussed in more detail in para. 3.12, TEXCO has agreed to appoint a Tech-
nical Management Firm (TMF) to assist it in carrying out a study on measures
to improve sector performance and to employ additional qualified staff to
implement the recommendations of the study.
3.05      The Government influence on financial and investment planning by
TEXCO is strong, although there is little interference in day-to-day oper-
ational matters.  Further, TEXCO companies operate as autonomous units and
are individually responsible for all financial obligations. However, TEXCO
supervises the operations of the existing mills and is also responsible for
the implementation of new textile projects.
B.   Operational Results
3.06      Main sources of income for TEXCO are the following received from
the group companies:  (a) dividends; (b) development fees 1/; (c) managerial,
directors' and secretarial fees; and (d) commission on guarantees for bank
overdrafts. In the first year of operation (1974), TEXCO showed a loss of
T Sh 1.1 million (US$0.13 million) because of establishment charges. In 1975,
however, it showed a profit of T Sh 7.1 million (US$0.9 million). But the
profit declined to T Sh 3.3 million (US$0.4 million) the following year
because of reduced dividends from the group companies. In 1977, TEXCO's
earnings rose to T Sh 7.0 million (US$0.8 million), largely as a result of
increased development fees on ongoing projects.
3.07      The Government channels its equity investment in the textile sector
through TEXCO. TEXCO shares in the individual companies range from 51% to
100%. The following table shows the holdings of TEXCO and the main highlights
of TEXCO's operating companies:
1/   TEXCO charges 1% of the annual investment on a new textile project as
development fees to cover preoperating costs.

/b   Started operations in 1977.
3.08      Four TEXCO companies produce textile fabrics, one manufactures
garments, one makes blankets, and the remaining two produce kenaf and sisal
bags, respectively. The production of textile fabrics by TEXCO companies
increased from 61 million sq/m in 1970 to 83.0 million sq/m in 1974 but de-
clined to 75.3 million sq/m and 68.4 million sq/m in 1976 and 1977 respec-
tively because of: (a) reduction in the number of expatriates in key posi-
tions before local staff could be fully prepared to take over; (b) lack of
adequate training and maintenance programs; (c) lack of spare parts to keep
equipment running at acceptable rates; and (d) power and water shortages,
which with the commissioning of new facilities have now largely been re-
solved. If all the companies had operated at effective capacity in 1977
(which is achievable under efficient operational conditions), the TEXCO group
companies would have produced about 95 million sq/m -- 27 million sq/m above
actual 1977 production.
3.09      Management of TEXCO is aware of the need to improve operations
at existing mills and a number of steps have been taken in this regard which
should have a positive effect on sectoral output in 1978 and beyond. The
URAFIKI mill completed a 5 million sq/m expansion program in mid-1977, and,
in November 1977, introduced an incentive system to reward workers for each
percentage increase in efficiency above a given base. As a result, by
February 1978, efficiency had jumped from 70% to 90% in spinning and from



-8-
65% to 85% in weaving. Production for 1978 is well ahead of budget and is
expected to reach at least 32 million sq/m, 25% over 1977 levels. With the
success of this program, TEXCO plans to introduce similar incentive systems
at its other mills once expansion and rehabilitation programs currently
underway or planned have been completed.
3.10      At SUNGURATEX, a rehabilitation, balancing and expansion program
was completed in October 1977, raising capacity there from 13 million to 22
million sq/m. The mill is now under a management contract with TOOTAL of the
U.K. and production, which was adversely affected by disruptions caused by
the 1977 expansion, is expected to increase to about 14 million sq/m in 1978,
50% higher than last year's output. At KILTEX, a modernization and expansion
program is scheduled to begin implementation in late 1978 (para. 3.25).
However, positive results from the reconditioning and replacenient of existing
equipment will not be felt until program completion in 1980.
3.11      The situation at MWATEX, whose current expansion program is being
financed by the Bank and the Kuwait Fund, is described in detail in paras.
3.17 to 3.21. Operations are expected to improve in 1979 once a rehabili-
tation program for existing equipment has been completed; the new plant is
fuLly on stream; and as operations are taken over by a management firm which
is to be appointed by June 1978 (para. 3.18).
3.12       In addition to the above programs, TEXCO has agreed to appoint
a qualified and experienced technical management firm (TMF) to assist TEXCO
in carrying out a study by December 31, 1978 to recommend measures to improve
the capacity utilization and productivity of the operating textile mills
wit:hin the TEXC() Group; modification or termination of the contract with
the TMF would be subject to the approval of the Bank. TEXCO has selected
TEIICATE of Hollgand as the TMF and signing of a contract, expected in June
1978, is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank/IDA loan/credit. Upon
completion of the study, TEXCO, in consultation with the Bank, will review the
study's recommendations and take necessary measures to improve the capacity
utilization and productivity of the operating mills, including the employment
of qualified and experienced technical personnel.
3.13      The first phase of activity i.e., the proposed textile sector study
and preparation of an improvement program with the assistance of the TMF,
which is expected to take about 6 months, would be financed by the Tanzanian
Investment Bank (TIB) using part of the IDA technical assistance funds 1/
provided through TIB for project preparation in general. The second phase
(implementation of the study's recommendations) would be coordinated by TEXCO
with the assistance or additional technical personnel. The services of such
personnel are estimated to involve about 300 man-months over 2-1/2 years
costing about US$2.2 million equivalent, including US$2 million in foreign
exchange. This amount is included in the Bank Group financing under the
proposed project.

3.14      As for financing of the improvement program proper, funds are being
sought from European sources for the KILTEX mills at Arusha and Dar-es-Salaam.
The SUNGURATEX and URAFIKI mills at Dar-es-Salaam have recently completed an
investment program for modernizing and balancing their operations. These
mills, with guidance from TMF on improved operating procedures and manpower
development, are expected to be able to achieve better efficiency and capa-
city utilization with minimum additional investment. As a matter of fact,
SUNGURATEX, which, as noted above, has a management contract with TOOTAL of
the U.K., should be able to show better performance with the increased
attention it is paying now to the training of operators. As for the other
existing mill (MWATEX), whose expansion is being financed by the Kuwait Fund
and the Bank, capital investments of US$3-4 million are needed to rectify some
of the deficiencies in the existing operations.
C.   Financial Position of TEXCO Group
3.15      The historical financial data (Annex 3) show a fairly satisfactory
sales and earnings record and reasonable debt/equity ratios for the four
TEXCO textile enterprises. SUNGURATEX showed 'a loss in 1975 but its earnings
improved in 1976. MWATEX was profitable through 1976, but due to declining
production suffered a loss in 1977 (para 3.19). The enterprises producing
blankets, and kenaf and sisal bags (para 3.07) continue to be unprofitable,
partly because of their low equity base and their heavy reliance on short-
term borrowings to service debt, and they have been experiencing working
capital problems.
3.16      Consolidated accounts of the TEXCO Group are not audited but
are compiled by TEXCO from the audited accounts of individual companies.
The following table shows the main highlights of the consolidated accounts:

'The consolidated accounts are not too significant as TEXCO units are auto-
nomous and inter-company transfer of funds are not allowed by the Government.
Even though the above consolidated figures show a satisfactory situation, it
has been noted that, with respect to individual units, the situation varies
and some are experiencing financial stringency.

D.   Operations of MWATEX
3.17      MWATEX (the expansion of which the Bank is helping t:o finance and
which is to be completed by mid-1978 as noted earlier) was operating satis-
factorily until 1975 when output reached 3,200 tons of yarn and 23.4 million
sq/n of fabric. However, production has declined since then. In 1976, the
company produced 2,700 tons of yarn and 20.7 million sq/m of fabric. In
1977, production of yarn fell to 2,500 tons, and fabric to 16.9 million sq/m.
Because of inadequate management and lack of attention to preventive and
operational maintenance efficiency as a percent of effective capacity in the
spinning mill was reduced to 59% in 1977 from 82% in 1975, and to 52% from
65% in the weaving mill.  At the time of appraisal of the Mwanza project in
November 1974, the company was operated with the help of a Swiss company on
the basis of a management contract for 26 expatriates.  At the end of 1974,
the contract was terminated and since then MWATEX has been operated by local
management with the help of a reduced number of expatriates based on contracts
with individuals, not with any single firm. This arrangement has not been
working satisfactorily. The operation of the company has also been affected
by technical problems mainly due to lack of preventive maintenance and short-
age of spare parts, which have resulted in excessive equipment down-time.
3.18      Under the Bank loan for the MWATEX expansion, TEXCO is obligated to
appoint a Management Agency Firm (MAF) before completion of that project for
at least three years to help MWATEX operate its expanded complex efficiently.
Since the expansion project is now nearing completion, TEXCO has selected
Saigol Brothers, of Pakistan, as MAF. A contract is expected to be signed
with Saigol in June 1978. TEXCO has also carried out studies for (i) recon-
ditioning (overhauling) and repositioning certain equipment in the existing
mill in order to attain a smooth flow of operations in MWATEX's existing and
expansion facilities; and (ii) carrying out emergency repairs to floor and
roc,f. Contracts are expected to be signed by June 1978 to implement the
recommendations of the studies. However, due to the lead time required to
order spare parts, actual work on equipment reconditioning is not expected to
begin until December 1978. Meanwhile, MAF will pay increased attention to
preventive maintenance, strengthening of training programs, and introduction
of an incentive system for employees. In addition, the general liberalization
of imported spares and materials by the Government will help ease the shortage
of spares and thereby alleviate maintenance delays in the future. Thus, with
the appointment of IAF and the implementation of the above measures, the
operations of MWATEX are expected to improve.
3.19      The historical income statements and balance sheets of MWATEX are
summarized below:

Sales and earnings performance through 1976 was acceptable despite moder-
ately declining production over the period. In 1977, however, sharply lower
production coupled with higher raw material costs (cotton prices rose 23%
in 1977 versus only an 8% rise in average fabric prices) resulted in a loss
for the year. Debt service coverage dropped to 0.7 times and loan repayments
and interest were met largely from bank overdrafts. Loan repayments for 1978,
however, amount to only T Sh 2.1 million (the Kuwait Fund and Bank loans are
not repayable until 1980) and while interest payments (about T Sb 15 million)
on outstanding loans will have to be made, MWATEX should be able to meet its
1978 debt service commitments from internal cash flow together with a moderate
amount of overdraft financing. This, however, should not impair the Company's
current ratio which reached a very satisfactory 2.5 times in 1977 as a result
of a T Sb 39.6 million Government equity contribution which substantially
reduced outstanding overdrafts.
3.20       Under the loan, MWATEX is obligated to submit annual audited finan-
cial statements within four months of the end of the year. However, MWATEX
has not been able to meet this obligation and the audited report for 1976 was
not received until February 1978. It is expected that the 1977 audit report
will be received by June 1978. This is partly because MWATEX does not have
adequately trained accountants to prepare the annual accounts of the company
in time and in sufficient detail for the Tanzania Audit Corporation (TAC),
which is in charge of auditing parastatal companies, to complete the audit of
the company. TEXCO has agreed that it will cause in the future independent
accounting firms (which are operating in Tanzania) to be entrusted with the



- 12 -
task of closing the account books of MWATEX in case the company is not able
to do so within two months of the end of each year. This will facilitate
the audit by TAC within the stipulated period. Through this arrangement,
it should be possible to get the annual audit report of MWATEX in time.
E.   Ongoing MWATEX Expansion
3.21      As already noted, the Mwanza project is being implemented satis-
factorily within the budget with Gherzi serving as Project Advisor and
Saigol Brothers, a textile operating company of Pakistan, serving as Project
Engineer. Orders for the equipment and machinery were placed at a time when
the market for such items was soft and, as a result, the winning bids were
significantly lower than anticipated. Therefore, the foreign exchange cost of
the project is at present expected to be lower than the appraisal estimate.
The total financing required by the project is likely to be 10-15% lower than
thie appraisal estimate of US$44.3 million in spite of a four-month delay in
project completion mainly due to equipment transportation problems within
Tanzania.  These problems have been successfully resolved with:  (a) the Rail-
ways providing more wagons to transport imported equipment from Dar-es-Salaam
Port to the project site; and (b) the granting of a special permission by the
Tanzanian Government for the transportation of steel structures for civil
works across the border to the project site. Finally, the Government is ex-
pedliting the commissioning of four new power turbo-generators by the Tanzania
Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) at its power sub-station near Mwanza in a
phased manner to meet the power requirements of the project in full by July
1978 when the project is expected to be commissioned.
F.   Other Projects Under Implementation or Planning
3.22      Three other projects under implementation by TEXCO are the Musoma
Textile Mill and the Tabora and Ubungo Spinning Mills. The Musoma project
is designed to produce 22 million sq/m of cotton fabrics. The base cost of
the: project estimated at US$59 million by TEXCO seems to be on the low side.
The project is being financed with French bilateral credit. Work on the
project started in July 1976 and is expected to be completed by July 1980.
Project design and engineering is being carried out by Messrs. Creusot-Loire
Enterprises, of France, and shipments of equipment and machinery are expected
to start in 1978.
3.23      Work has also commenced on the Tabora Spinning Mill for completion
by the end of 1979. The mill is designed to have 50,160 spindles to produce
5,950 tons of cotton yarn per year (40% in 20's carded, 60% in 40's combed,
some doubled). The project cost is estimated at US$30.4 million and the
Tanzanian Investment Bank (TIB) is providing US$3 million from a Bank loan
(1172-TA) channeled through TIB to meet part of the foreign exchange costs.
Suppliers' credit from Toyo Menka Ltd., of Japan, has also been arranged to
meet most of the cost of equipment and machinery. Of the total yarn pro-
duction, about 50% is intended for export and the rest for meeting the needs
of local weaving mills. Tata Consulting Engineers, of India, have been
appointed to carry out the project design and engineering work, including

project supervision and coordination and commissioning of the mill, and
training of personnel. The mill is expected to be managed by an expatriate
management team.
3.24      The Ubungo Spinning Mill, on which work began in mid-1977, is
scheduled for completion in mid-1980. The mill is designed to produce 3,000
tons of cotton yarn annually (40% in 20's carded, 30% in 40's combed, and 30%
in 40's combed and twisted). Project cost is estimated at about US$18.3 mil-
lion of which US$8.2 million is being provided by the Industrial Development
Bank of India for imported equipment and training of workers. The entire
production is intended for export and TEXCO has reportedly entered into a long
term marketing,arrangement for the mill's output. Lakshmi Textile Exporters
Ltd. of India have been hired as project engineers to carry out engineering
design, supervision of project implementation, coordination of training, and
project commissioning.
3.25      While plans are not yet finalized, TEXCO expects to begin a balanc-
ing, modernization and expansion program at KILTEX's existing Arusha and Dar-
es-Salaam mills in September 1978 with completion scheduled for early 1980.
Total financing required is estimated at US$25 million with foreign costs
likely to be financed by European sources. The program includes the purchase
of additional looms, carding, drawing and ring-spinning equipment at Arusha
to raise annual capacity there to 4.0 and 11.0 million sq/m of polyester and
cotton fabrics respectively from 1.5 and 7.4 million sq/m now. Obsolete looms
at the Dar-es-Salaam mill would be replaced so as to improve weaving effi-
ciency. Its present capacity of 15 million sq/m of cotton fabric annually,
however, would remain unchanged. Saigol Bros. (Pakistan), who are responsible
for implementation of the MWATEX expansion, have been appointed project
engineers.
3.26      The Government is also considering a textile mill at Mlbeya with
an annual production capacity of about 25 million sq/m of cotton fabrics
including 7 million sq/m of grey cloth for export under a long-term con-
tract with the German Democratic Republic which has reportedly offered
to finance the project. Negotiations for financing and technical assistance
are still underway. However, TEXCO expects that work on the project will
begin in July 1978 with completion targeted for mid-1982.
3.27      It has been agreed that TEXCO will continue to provide information
to the Bank on major developments in the textile sector.
G.   Organization and Management of New Project
3.28      A new company, Morogoro Polyester Textiles Limited, has been estab-
lished to own and operate the proposed project. The General Manager of the
Company will be appointed for an indefinite period on the recommendation of
the Board of Directors of the relevant parastatal organization (in this case
TEXCO) in consultation with the Minister of Industries. During the next 12
months or so, a plan covering the organizational structure of the Company when
in operation will have to be prepared with the help of the Project Advisory
Firm (PAF) to be hired by TEXCO to assist TEXCO's own Project Implementation
Unit (PIU) in implementing the project (para 5.13).



- 14 -
3.29       Key personnel to support the General Manager are expected to be
trained abroad by the Company during the next four years (para 5.16). Dur-
ing the initial years of operation of the project, the Company will have
to rely on expatriate assistance for performing key technical and managerial
functions. The Company and TEXCO have agreed that a Management Agency
Firm (MAF) will be appointed six months before the mechanical completion
of the project for at least three years of initial plant operation. More-
over, the contract with the MAE may not be modified or terminated without
prior Bank consent. The General Manager will be appointed in time to gain
practical experience under the MAF, so that he can be groomed to take over
management responsibility when the latter complete their assignment.
IV. MARKET AND MARKETING
A.   Past Production and Consumption
4.01       Since 'the mid-1960's, Tanzania's production of woven textiles has
increased sharplj, but is still inadequate to meet the local demand as is
shown in Annex 4-1 and summarized in the following table:

4.02      As a result of the development of a national textile industry, based
on cotton, total production of woven textiles increased from about 9 million
sq/m in 1966 to 67 million sq/m in 1970 and rose to a peak of 91 million sq/m
in 1974. However, domestic production declined during the following years to
88 million sq/m and 85 million sq/m, respectively, due to the mill problems
mentioned earlier (para 3.08). Although the significant growth of domestic
textile production contributed to reduce the country's import of cotton
fabrics, imports of blended fabrics have on the whole remained significant,
though the actual imports have been fluctuating sharply because of varying
degrees of import restrictions due to persistent balance of payments problems.
In 1974, when import restrictions were relatively relaxed and also domestic
textile output reached its peak, Tanzania still imported about 32 million sq/m
of textiles (half of which were blended fabrics) valued at T Sh 241 million
(US$29 million). Imports in 1974 met about 26% of the total apparent con-
sumption of textiles in that year. Also in 1974, unsatisfied demand, that
had been building up over previous years, was estimated to have reached about
21 million sq/m 1/. Reflecting the domestic supply constraints in textiles,
exports of textiles (cotton fabrics and blankets) to neighboring countries
have been small, amounting to 2.5 million sq/m in 1974 and even less in the
following years.
4.03      Import restrictions on textiles were intensified in 1975 and 1976
because of the economic crisis, reducing total imports to just 8 million
sq/m in 1976. In addition, domestic textile production decreased. As a
result, total apparent textile consumption declined from 120 million sq/m in
1974 to about 100 million sq/m in 1975 and 93 million sq/m in 1976.  On a per
capita basis, the apparent consumption dropped from 8.5 sq/m in 1974 to about
6 sq/m in 1976, which was less than the level reached in the mid-1960's (1966:
7.5 sq/m). With these developments, there has been a further accumulation of
unsatisfied demand. Taking into account the unsatisfied demand estimated for
1974 and the actual growth of per capita income in 1975 and 1976 as well as
the elasticity of demand for textiles, total consumption in 1976 might have
reached 153 million sq/m (10 sq/m per capita) but for supply constraints.
B.   Pattern of Fiber Consumption
4.04      Total per capita consumption of natural and man-made fibers was
only 1.7 kg in Tanzania in 1974 but declined since then to an estimated 1.2 kg
in 1976 (Annex 4-2). This compares unfavorably not only with consumption
levels reached in the past in Tanzania -- e.g., in 1966 per capita consumption
was 1.9 kg -- but also with consumption levels reached in other African
countries. In 1974, total fiber consumption was 1.6 kg in Mali 2/ and
Niger 2/, 2.2 kg in the Sudan, 2.8 kg in Togo, 3.2 kg in Somalia, 2/ 3.5 kg
in Zambia, 4.0 kg in Ghana and 5.0 kg in Egypt, while the average of all
developing countries was 2.6 kg. In the US, the comparable figure was 22 kg.

4.05      The consumption of synthetics as a percentage of total fiber
consumption is increasing rapidly in developed as well as developing countries
due to the popularity of blended fabrics on account of their favorable cost/
benefit aspects (as discussed in detail in para. 8.06). During 1964-76,
world consumption of all fibers increased from 17.8 million tons to 26.9 mil-
lion tons, with the share of synthetics rising from 9.6% to 32.0% during
this period. In line with these worldwide changes in textile fiber con-
sumption patterns, textile demand in Tanzania also has been shifting to
fabrics with blends of cotton and man-made fibers (e.g. polyester, rayon,
etr.) Much of the domestic demand for blended fabrics has, however, remained
suppressed in Tanzania for reasons mentioned earlier. The domestic production
of such textiles is thus far insignificant, amounting to less than 5 million
sq/m in 1976 from two private mills (rayon/cotton fabrics) and TEXCO's KILTEX
MiLl at Arusha (polyester/rayon fabrics with the trade name TAKRON). Further,
there is so far no local production of polyester/cotton fabrics. Imports of
blended fabrics, on the other hand, have been held at very low levels by the
Golvernment due to foreign exchange constraints. In 1976, they amounted to
on:Ly 6 million sq/m compared to about 20 million sq/m in 1973, when import
restrictions were less severe. It should be mentioned that imports of blended
fabrics had exceeded 20 million sq/m back in 1966, mostly blends of cotton
wi:h synthetic i-ibers. This points to the existence of a substantial demand
for blended fabrics as early as a decade ago.
4.06      As a result of the curtailed supply of blended fabrics in Tanzania,
the country's consumption of man-made fibers has remained at lower levels than
in most other developing countries. As shown in the following table, synthetic
fiber consumption as a percentage of total fiber consumption is substantially
lower in Tanzania (1974: 11%) than in all developing countries combined (20%)
and also lower than in any regional group of developing countries, including
that of Africa (16%). In this context, the increased availability of blended
fabrics from the proposed project would help meet the existing demand, in-
cluLding the unsatisfied latent demand, and bring the pattern of textile
con,sumption in Ianzania more in line with that in other developing countries.

4.07      An important factor in the increasing consumer preference for
blended fabrics, particularly polyester blends, has been the better quality
and performance as well as tensile strength of such fabrics as compared to
textiles made solely of natural fibers. Polyester blends have become popular
in Tanzania despite high sales taxes and customs duties on such fabrics.
Yet, given the much greater durability of polyester blends (two to three
times that of pure cotton textiles), the changing consumer preference is
economically rational as further detailed in Chapter VIII (para. 8.06).
4.08      The point should also be made that the preference for blend fabrics
is not limited to the urban population in Tanzania but is prevalent through-
out the country and in many segments of the population. Blend fabrics have
already found a ready market in work clothes, school uniforms and other
institutional clothes.
4.09      Worldwide, polyester has become the most important man-made fiber
used in textiles. It is a thermoplastic synthetic polymer of high tensile
strength, and, unlike cotton and rayon, it has low affinity to water. In
combination with cotton and rayon, polyester gives the blend fabrics the
following superior properties over all-cotton fabrics:



- 18 -
(a) Improved Wear Life - Blend fabrics (65/35 polyester/
cotton) are two to three times more durable than all-
cotton fabrics;
(b) Easy Care Properties - Blended fabrics are easy to
laundier, retain less water after washing, dry
quickier, and need little ironing. This is considered
to be the single most important reason for consumer
preference for blend fabrics;
(c)  Crease Resistance - Good crease shedding and crease
resistance during wear ensures a high quality appearance
for blend fabrics; and
(d)  Improved Stability - Maximum shrinkage of a blend is
usual:Ly 3% compared to 5-8% for a cotton fabric
after multiple laundering.
4.10      The b:Lend ratios have been established over the years on the basis
of experience wiith respect to optimizing performance of fabrics as far as
the above mentioned properties are concerned. The blend ratios vary depending
on the types of fabrics and end uses. For conventional trouserings, for
example, one of the most important fabric is the blend of polyester with
standard or high crimp viscose, usually in a 65/35 ratio, since this provides
the handle, warmth and aesthetic characteristics required for everyday use.
The polyester/cotton fabrics of 50/50 or 65/35 blends are used for more casual
type slacks, where a cleaner, cooler handle and appearance is required. Fur-
ther, for workwear and other heavy wear fabrics, the 65/35 blend of polyester/
cot:ton gives the optimum result as to tensile strength.

/a   Production for local supply, including the proposed project.
/b   Averages of minimum and maximum projected demand levels shown in Annex 4-4.
4.12      The above production forecasts are based on successful implementa-
tion of rehabilitation programs at TEXCO mills and expansion projects recently
completed and/or currently in progress, plus the new integrated cotton mills
at Musoma and Nbeya, and the proposed project. The production forecasts
assume attainment of 90% capacity utilization at the existing mills of MWATEX,
KILTEX, SUNGURATEX and URAFIKI by 1979-81, following implementation of the
rehabilitation programs (para 3.09 to 3.11). On the basis of these assump-
tions, total mill output is expected to increase from 85 million sq/m in 1976
to 135 million sq/m in 1980 and 194 million sq/m in 1985. The capacity output
of the proposed Morogoro Project would account for about 11% of the total
textile production in Tanzania in 1985.
4.13      Since the erratic pattern of past textile consumption and the
existence of considerable latent demand do not provide sufficient guidance
for estimating future textile demand in Tanzania, minimum and maximum demand
projections were prepared and are given in Annex 4-4. These projections
provide a realistic range of demand that can be expected under both unfavor-
able and favorable conditions, with actual demand likely to be somewhere in
between. The low end of the demand projections is based on actual 1974
consumption figures. The high end of the demand projections, on the other
hand, takes into account an unsatisfied demand estimated at 21 million sq/m
in 1974.



- 20 -
4.L4      The year 1974 was chosen as the base year for demand projections
since in more recent years (1975 and 1976) consumption was affected by severe
import restrictiLons in Tanzania. Demand projections are based on the assump-
tions of an average annual growth of GNP of 4% (Bank projection), a population
growth rate of 2.8% per year and a real per capita income growth rate of 1.2%
per year during 1975-80. The assumed income elasticity of demand for all
woven textiles is conservatively assumed to be 1.0 (0.85 for cotton textiles
ancl 1.75 for mart-made textiles), which is lower than the 1.35 average for
all. developing countries 1/ but considered more realistic given Tanzania's
low per capita income level. 2/ For the period 1981-85, an acceleration of
eccinomic growth is anticipated which is likely to lead to a stronger increase
in textile demanLd and to changes on the demand pattern. Specifically, it
is assumed that the average annual growth rate of GNP would be 5.4% (Bank
projection) and that, with a continued population growth of 2.8% per year, an
annual increase in the per capita income of 2.6% would be possible. Accord-
ingly, the income elasticity of demand for all textiles is assumed to rise to
1.1 during 1981-85, with the elasticity for cotton textiles declining to 0.7
but that for man-made fiber textiles increasing to almost 3.
4.15      These changes in demand pattern are derived from the observed demand
behavior in other developing countries with comparable income levels and struc-
ture of textile demand in those countries, and are on the conservative side.
Annex 4-6 gives historical elasticity of demand data for man-made fibers of
selected developing countries ranked by capita income levels. The assumptions
for man-made fiber demand in Tanzania take into account the country's compara-
tively low consumption of man-made fiber textiles as compared to most other
developing countries (para 4.06) and imply some catching up in Tanzania's
synthetic fiber consumption in line with the changing consumption patterns
in the developing countries in general. Based on these assumptions, the per
capita consumption of man-made fiber textiles is projected to grow from 1.3
sq/rm in 1974 to 2.3 sq/m in 1985. Under the assumptions made, the latent
demand of woven textiles is estimated to rise from 21 million sq/m in 1974 to
around 60 million sq/m in 1978 before declining in the following years as a
result of sharply improved supplies in cotton fabrics. By 1982 latent demand
may drop to aboult 15-20 million sq/m, at which time it would largely be in
blended fabrics assuming restrictions on imports of blended fabrics would
conitinue.
4.16      In cotton textiles, a comparison of the projected local supply
with the average of the minimum and maximum demand projections indicates that
Tanzania would practically achieve self-sufficiency in 1980, but the supply
situation is likely to be less comfortable in later years as the population
grows and demand increases. As a result, the deficit would again increase
substantially in the mid to late 1980's, when TEXCO is likely to vertically
integrate one of the new spinning mills with weaving and finishing facilities.

4.17      For blended fabrics, the median projected demand is expected to
increase to 28 million sq/m in 1980 and 46 million sq/m in 1985.  The pro-
posed project would cover only part of the demand (1985: 41%) leaving a
substantial and increasing supply deficit to be met by imports. The output
of the project would, on the basis of the assumed product mix (para 5.05)
in 1985 probably meet half of the anticipated Tanzanian demand of suiting
materials but only about one-third of the demand of shirting materials. In
1985, import requirements of man-made fiber textiles are projected at 18
million sq/m. Therefore, the feasibility of expanding the Morogoro textile
mill will be studied by TEXCO in the early 1980's. In the project's plant
lay-out, expansion possibilities have been taken into account and adequate
space provisions have been made (para 5.01).
4.18      The project is primarily for import substitution and no significant
quantities of blend fabrics are expected to be available for exports. Never-
theless, there is a potential to sell up to 2 million sq/m of blended fabrics
(equivalent to 9% of capacity output) to other East African countries, in-
cluding Mozambique, Zambia, Kenya, Rwanda and Burundi.  Zambia, the country
with the highest per capita income in the East African region, for example,
imported in 1974, 38 million sq/m of man-made fiber textiles (including 10
million sq/m of synthetic fabrics). With only one cotton mill in Zambia
and no other textile projects currently under consideration, that country
could potentially be the best outlet should there be any surplus from the
proposed project.
D. Marketing and Distribution System
4.19      Marketing and distribution arrangements for textiles in Tanzania
have been subjected to several changes in recent years. These changes were
made mainly in response to persistent difficulties in ensuring a regionally
balanced distribution of textiles under prevailing conditions of supply short-
ages and institutional constraints. Between 1970 and February 1976, virtually
all marketing and distribution of yarns, fabrics and other textile products
whether domestically produced or imported, were handled by the National Textile
Trading Company (NATEX). This state trading company, which was part of the
National Development Corporation, had gradually built up a network of 35
regional distribution centers for textiles, covering Dar-es-Salaam and the
19 other regions of Tanzania; this network was adequate to meet established
allocation and marketing objectives. However, NATEX faced serious managerial
problems which gave rise to distribution irregularities and, eventually,
public charges of corruption. As a result of these developments, and despite
a profitable record of operations, NATEX was finally dissolved in February
1976.
4.20      Following the dissolution of NATEX, the Tanzania Textile Trading
Company (TANZATEX) was established under the Ministry of Trade with some
important changes in the existing marketing and distribution system. Whereas
TANZATEX, as its predecessor, was given the sole operational responsibility
for all textile exports and imports, TANZATEX became responsible for marketing



- 22 -
and distribution of TEXCO products only to the Regional Trading Companies
(RTCs), which have absorbed the former regional organizations of NATEX.
Text:iles manufactured by the private sector are now marketed directly through
RTCs and other wholesalers.
4.21      Tanzania Textile Trading Company (TANZATEX):  As the sole exporter
and importer of textiles and the marketing and distribution agent for pro-
duct:s of TEXCO companies, TANZATEX has a key role in the supply of textile
products and materials to both intermediary traders and consumers, and to
the local knitting and garment industry. 1/ TANZATEX (which was established
in February 1976) operates its own truck fleet and also relies on trucks
hired from other transport companies, and on railway and shipping services.
Its total turnover during 1976 (Feb.-Dec.) amounted to T Sh 714 million,
of which 83% was accounted for by local sales of domestic products, 14% by
imports and 3% by exports. Domestic sales of locally manufactured and imported
textiles are concentrated in the Dar-es-Salaam (1976, over 50%) and Mwanza
areas (about 20%), reflecting the comparably higher purchasing power in these
parts of the country and preferences given in supplies to RTCs located near
the existing mills and warehouses.
4.22      TANZATEX's distribution is based on annual sales plans prepared
on the basis of past regional sales records and a quota system that reflects
anticipated local production and imports. Against these plans, orders from
RTCs and other customers are fixed and confirmed for periods of six months,
respectively. Despite these provisions, TANZATEX has in the past frequently
been unable to comply with approved and confirmed orders and delivery dates,
and deliveries of fast-moving items were made contingent on the acceptance
of unordered slow-moving items. Because of management and other staff con-
straints, TANZATEX is ill-equipped to perform its designated functions effi-
ciently. Its activities are too centralized to ensure a balanced distribution
of textiles in Tanzania. Of its current local staff of 120 persons, almost
100 are employed at headquarters and its three warehouses in Dar-es-Salaam.
Outside the capital, TANZATEX employs only 22 persons, 18 of whom are located
at its Mwanza warehouse and 4 are attached to the KILTEX mill in Arusha. There
are no other branches elsewhere in the country and essentially all purchasing
and sales operations are handled from Dar-es-Salaam with an executive staff
of less than 20. Marketing research and export promotion services are vir-
tually non-existent.
4.23      The operational and organizational weaknesses of TANZATEX reflected
in the unbalanced distributions of fabrics were largely responsible for the
growing pile-up at TANZATEX warehouses of certain mill products that required
effective promotion and sales strategy.  To remedy this situation, the Ministry
of Trade authoriz,ed the KILTEX mill at Arusha in June 1977 to commence direct
sales of linen, "gingham" and TAKRON (the only polyester/rayon blended fabric
manufactured in Tanzania). As a result of this measure, stocks of these
1/   The Government has recently taken measures allowing all mills, by July 1,
1978, to distribute their output directly through Regional Trading
Companies (RTC's). TANZATEX from thereafter would be responsible only
for distribution of imported textiles and the export of local fabrics.



- 23 -
products were reduced rapidly and the mill became directly alerted to several
deficiencies and consumer preferences associated with some of its products,
e.g. fading and unpopular colors, and designs and weaving defects, all of
which had contributed to past slow sales. Direct distribution is also essen-
tial for the products of the proposed mill. It would help the new Company
to build up an efficient sales organization and would facilitate early adjust-
ments in the product mix to changes in market conditions, and consumer tastes
and styles, and elimination of slow-moving items from the product mix.  Saving
on margins for intermediaries (para 4.29) would also help to keep prices to
the consumer at more acceptable levels.  The change in Government policy to
allow all mills to distribute their output directly was confirmed during nego-
tiations and the Government agreed that it would continue to make satisfactory
arrangements for the sale and distribution of the output from the proposed
project.
4.24      Regional Trading Companies (RTCs):  The State-owned RTCs are the
regional wholesalers for consumer goods and a wide range of producer goods.
RTCs entered the textile trade only in February 1976 when they took over the
existing godowns and warehouses of NATEX. Most of their textile supplies
are obtained from TANZATEX, and their customers are cooperatives and private
retailers as well as garment manufacturers. RTCs are represented in the 19
regions of the country but in only about 75% of the 90 districts of Tanzania.
Current expansion plans call for the establishment of RTC outlets in every
district by 1981. Dar-es-Salaam has its own RTC, the Dar-es-Salaam Textile
Company (DARTEX).
4.25      Due to delivery irregularities, RTCs generally suffer from uneven
flows of textiles and order variations which compel them to apply rigid dis-
tribution criteria for scarce items. In fast-moving items of short supply
such as MWATEX "khanga", URAFIKI "kitenge", and checked polyester/rayon
fabrics from KILTEX, distribution priorities are given to the cooperative
(Ujaama) stores. These retail stores typically account for about 10-15% of
the turnover of RTCs. Clothiers and other garment manufacturers, accounting
for less than 15% of the turnover of all RTCs usually get a preference in the
supply of available suitings, shirtings and similar materials. For the large
segment of individual retailers, however, the allocation of items of great
demand is generally made contingent on the acceptance of other slow-moving
items.
4.26      Because of prevailing serious supply shortages, garment manufac-
turers in Tanzania have suffered in recent years from sharply declining capa-
city utilization, which forced them to lay off labor and to introduce part-
time work schedules. A number of manufacturers also closed down entirely
or shifted their activities to the production of knitted goods which had less
material constraints than for the manufacture of garments. The proposed
project would help to revive the depressed labor-intensive clothing industry.
4.27      Textile sales in Tanzania are made against cash or banker's draft.
TANZATEX currently buys mill products against cash payment on delivery and
markets those products through sub-wholesalers (RTCs) against cash or banker's
draft. This practice was introduced in early 1977 largely in response to
previously experienced difficulties in obtaining prompt payments from RTCs.
However, these difficulties have been generally overcome.



- 24 -
E. Pricing of lTextile Products
4.28      Textile prices in Tanzania are determined by the National Price
Commission (NPC) of the Ministry of Trade which periodically sets the ex-
factory and retaLil prices for every textile product and also fixes margins
or maximum selling prices for each level of distribution. Prices of locally
produced textiles are in principle reviewed every six months, those of imported
gocods every three months. In practice, however, such periodic reviews have
taken place in longer intervals, partly because of manpower constraints at
NPC and partly because of the inability of Tanzanian companies to give prompt
replies to the very detailed NPC questionnaires used for these reviews. As a
result of this, most prices of locally produced textiles remainied unchanged
frcm September 1976 to March 1978, when prices were again revised. Price
revisions for imported textiles took place in May 1977 and in March 1978.
4.29      Domestic Fabrics.  For existing textile mills, ex-factory prices for
locally produced fabrics are generally based on total production costs (in-
cluding depreciation) at efficient operation, and currently a mill margin of
8% is allowed. The efficiency test is, however, not strictly applied.
Consequently, actual costs rather than standard costs are used in the fixation
of prices, and little incentive is thus actually given for the individual
plant to lower costs and improve productivity. For new textile plants, for
which investment costs in real terms have gone up sharply since 1973, NPC is
allDwing 30-40% pre-tax return (15-20% after tax) on capital employed on a
case-by-case basis. The ex-factory price is the price charged by the mills to
the wholesaler, which in most cases is TANZATEX. TANZATEX, in turn, sells
fabrics to the so-called sub-wholesalers (RTCs) at a price that contains a 3%
mar'k-up on the price paid to the mills plus an average margin of about 1% for
the purpose of price equalization. The sub-wholesaler (RTC) price to garment
manufacturers and retailers is usually set to include a profit margin of 7%
for the RTC plus an additional 1% for price equalization. Retail prices,
finally, include a general mark-up of 10% over the sub-wholesale price and are
uniform throughout the country. Therefore, the consumer price is about 23%
higher than the exfactory price of fabrics. This mark-up compares favorably
with that in some other developing countries (e.g. about 25% in Egypt).
4.30      Other Domestic Textile Products:  The present price system for
locally produced make-up and clothing articles is different from that applied
to fabrics. This is mainly because of the different and more variable cost
structure of the different manufacturing plants and the absence of TANZATEX
as intermediary between local producers and RTC. Established manufacturers'
margins range from about 10% in the case of blankets to about 20% in the case
of outerwear. RTC mark-ups vary between 5% and 10%, with the average being
8%, and retail margins are generally about 10%.
4.3].     Imported Textiles.  The selling prices of TANZATEX, which, as
already noted, is the sole importer of textiles in Tanzania, are based on the
landed cost of the imports plus a 3% mark-up on such costs. Since imported
textiles are predominantly fast-moving items, the RTC margin has been fixed at
about 5%, i.e., lower than for domestic textile products. The retailer margin
is fixed at 10%.



- 25 -
4.32      Textile imports are carried out on the basis of licensing by the
Government and are generally discouraged to conserve scarce foreign exchange.
Customs duties on textile imports range from 30% to 60% of the CIF cost, and
the sales tax on such imports amounts up to 72-1/4% of the duty-paid costs.
Because of these high taxes and duties, the consumer price of a typical
imported blend fabric is about 200% higher than the CIF imported price.
V. THE PROJECT
A. Project Scope, Location and Product Mix
5.01      The project will consist of an integrated textile mill with spinning,
weaving and processing facilities to produce about 21.5 million sq/m (19 mil-
lion Im equivalent) of blended fabrics of medium to fine quality for shirtings
and suitings. The mill will produce for the first time in the country about
14 million sq/m of polyester/cotton blended fabrics and will help expand
the country's limited capacity to produce polyester/rayon blended fabrics
from 1.8 million to 9.3 million sq/m. Project size was decided after studying
various alternatives and after taking into account the demand for blended fab-
rics, economies of scale, and availability of financing. Details are given
in Annex 5-1. As mentioned in the preceding Chapter, the capacity output of
the project represents about 11% of Tanzania's projected total fabric pro-
duction in mid-1980's. Four preselected locations were considered for the
project, namely Tanga, Morogoro, Arusha and Mwanza. After detailed analysis
of costs and benefits, Morogoro, a town with a population of some 40,000
located about 200 km west of Dar-es-Salaam, was selected by TEXCO and the
Government as the location for the project. Morogoro is well connected by
road and rail transportation. Further, it is centrally located with respect
to major market areas. The selected site for the project covers an area of
30 acres and is adjacent to the Morogoro Industrial Estate, a project being
financed by the Bank (1386-TA). The site includes space for possible future
expansion of the project.
5.02      The project will include about 42,000 ring spindles and 664 auto-
matic shuttle looms of modern conventional design and finishing facilities
with modern devices to ensure product quality. As is normal in the textile
mills, the finishing facilities will have a surplus capacity of about 30%
to take care of unavoidable production peaks, changes in consumer tastes,
reprocessing and sampling needs.
5.03      Assuming 7,728 working hours per annum and at an operating effi-
ciency of 85% in the spinning department, the annual manufacturing capacity
of blended yarns will be about 4,620 tons, of which 3,970 tons will be con-
sumed by the mill's weaving department and the remaining 650 tons will be
sold locally to replace the present imports of blended polyester/rayon
yarn required for weaving suiting material at the existing KILTEX mill at
Arusha. At a conservative operating efficiency of 75% in the weaving depart-
ment, the manufacturing capacity is estimated at 21.5 million sq/m per year
as noted in para 5.01.



- 26 -
5.04      It is assumed that the project will produce fabrics with a blend
rat:io of 65% polyester and 35% cotton for shirtings, and 65% poLyester and
35% rayon for suitings.  These blend ratios are commonly used in the world
especially for shirtings and suitings to give optimum results regarding
durability and fabric stability, with little sacrifice in comfort.  However,
the project woulcd have considerable flexibility to change the blend ratio,
should the market conditions warrant it, with little additional capital
investment. For example, the project could produce 100% cotton fabrics with
an additional investment of about US$1.3 million.
5.0'i      The product mix of the project which is based on data from the
market study prepared by Gherzi (para 1.04) and accepted by the Bank, will
include the following:

B. Project Technology
5.06       The technologies presently available for a textile mill can be grouped
under three main categories: (a) pre-conventional technology (PCT) based on
narrow mechanical looms and direct spinning; (b) conventional technology (CT)
based on broad automatic shuttle looms, and ring spindles; and (c) advanced
technology (AT) based on labor-saving techniques such as automatic opening of
blow rooms, chute-fed high-speed cards, single-process drawing in tandem with
carding, open-end spinning, unifils and electronically-operated shuttleless
looms which are increasingly introduced in developed countries in the face of
sharp increases in labor costs. For most applications, PCT technology has
become outdated because of: (a) very slow machine speed; (b) higher capital
and operating costs than for CT machines to produce a given quantity of fab-
rics per year; and (c) lack of machine versatility to produce finer fabrics.
Further, the use of the PCT technology requires highly skilled operators.



- 27 -
The various technologies available have been examined in detail with respect
to costs and benefits before recommending the appropriate technology for
Tanzanian conditions (Annex 5-1). For the proposed project, modern but con-
ventional technology (CT) would be used for the spinning and weaving mills --
the main units of the project accounting for about 85% of the project cost.
As for the finishing mill, the latest processing technology would be used to
ensure high product quality and also to economize on the use of water, fuel,
dyestuffs and chemicals. The use of this technology at the finishing mill
is not oriented toward saving on labor. Were a less advanced process to be
employed, the finishing mill would require hardly any additional employees.
C. Buildings
5.07      A covered floor space of about 61,300 m  is provided to house the
new facilities, including about 16,300 m  for offices, stores and social facil-
ities. The actual built-up area will be about 71,500 m . Open space between
different department buildings is provided for in the plant layout (Annex 5-2)
to allow for later expansion of the project. The area of the floor space is
in line iith norms accepted in the textile industry i.e., 0.5 m  per spindle
and 20 m per loom. The main factory buildings would be of structural steel
on reinforced concrete foundations. The walls and roof construction would
consist of galvanized steelframes cladded with corrugated aluminum sheets.
D. Raw Materials and Utilities
5.08      The basic raw materials required by the project are cotton, poly-
ester and rayon staple fibers. At maximum output, the project would require
about 1,090 tons of cotton, 3,210 tons of polyester, and 830 tons of rayon
fibers per year. Cotton is available locally. About 95% of the cotton crop
is grown in the Lake Victoria region and the rest on the coastal areas. The
coastal cotton is not well suited for blending with polyester as it has a
tendency to form neps during processing. The lake region cotton variety
(Mwanza AR, Grade No. 1) grown 300-400 km from tMorogoro will, therefore, be
used by the project. Polyester and rayon will have to be imported. As men-
tioned in para 2.13, effective July 1, 1978, companies in Tanzania will be
allowed to import their raw material requirements directly.  The Government
has agreed to continue to make satisfactory arrangements for the timely
procurement of imported raw materials, maintenance materials and spare parts
for the project.
5.09     3The water requirement for the project is estimated at 100 cubic
meters (m ) per hour to be made available from the municipal water supply
system. Morogoro is currently experiencing a water shortage. However, the
Mindu Dam Project financed by the Bank (1354-TA), which is now under implemen-
tation, is expected to be completed by August 1980 i.e., some 13 months prior
to the expected completion of the textile project. The Mindu Dam Project will
have a capacity to supply 24,000 m  per day of water and will help meet the
projected demand for water for domestic and industrial use in the Morogoro
region until 1996. The raw water required for the project will be stored in
concrete tanks with a capacity for an average consumption of eight hours.
Almost 50% of the water used will have to be treated for dyeing, boiler feed,
airconditioning and drinking purposes. Steam required for production in the



- 28 -
processing department will be generated by two package boilers each with a
caopacity of 10 tons per hour.
5.10      Electric power needs of the project are estimated to be about
6 14W/hour and will be met by the Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO)
which is the Government entity responsible for all power supply and distri-
bution in the country. No difficulties are foreseen in meeting the project
requirements of water and power. However, agreement has been reached with
the Government that it will take appropriate measures to ensure adequate
supplies of power and water in time for the project.
E. Housing
5.[1      Morogoro is being developed as a growth center to relieve congestion
in Dar-es-Salaara. With the attraction of industries to the area, the develop-
ment of workers" housing in Morogoro needs careful attention. In Tanzania,
the National Housing Board has the responsibility for developing such housing
facilities in cooperation with the Tanzania Housing Bank. In response to a
request by the Government, TEXCO has prepared a workers' housing plan for the
proposed textile project. Agreement has been reached with the Government
that adequate sites and services for workers' housing will be developed in
Morogoro.  Workers would build their own houses with loans from the Tanzania
Housing Bank and the assistance of the National Housing Board. As for housing
facilities for expatriates and top and middle-level executives, a provision of
T Sh 7.5 million (US$0.9 million equivalent) has been made in the project cost
estimates; these facilities will be built 5 km away from the site in a good
residential area on the hills in Morogoro.
F. Ecological Considerations and Occupational Hazards
5.12      The air quality of Morogoro is relatively good because there are
few industrial units in the area at present. The plant site will be within
the area specified for future industrial expansion and is at a distance of
3 km from the existing outskirts of Morogoro city. There are no Tanzanian
standards for pollution control. In the project, however, provision has
been made to keep within internationally acceptable limits the discharge of
solid, liquid and gaseous wastes. The steam boilers will be equipped with
automatic regulating devices to ensure maximum combustion so as to control
the discharge of CO in the flue gases. The chimneys will be designed to
limit the emission of sulfur dioxide to an annual arithmetic mean of not
more than 100 micrograms/m . Both spinning and weaving departments will be
adiabatically air-conditioned (to achieve better operational efficiency and
environmental protection), and the return air will be sucked through grills
into the return air duct system constructed underground where it will be
filtered. Accordingly, the dust content in both spinning and weaving depart-
3
ments will be kept below the annual geometric mean level of 100 micrograms/m.
Full ventilation will be provided in the processing department but without
air cycling and all equipment generating steam or heat will have special hoods
with forced exhaust systems to improve working conditions. The effluent from
the processing department will be treated in an industrial water treatment
plant at the plant site before being discharged to the planned main sewer of
the Morogoro industrial area to be completed by 1980. The biological oxygen



- 29 -
demand (BOD) and the pH values of the treated water will be kept below the
levels of 100 ppm and 6-8 respectively. Sanitary sewage will be collected
into a septic tank and its overflow will be connected to the main sewer. The
design of the buildings will allow the noise level to be kept below 90 deci-
bels. Fire protection will consist of a hydrant network, fire extinguishers,
fire alarm system, etc. An emergency lighting system will be provided to give
minimum lighting in case of power failure. These environmental facilities are
judged adequate, but agreement has been reached with TEXCO that they will in
fact be installed and properly maintained.
G. Project Implementation
5.13      Project implementation covers about 3-1/2 years of construction
followed by a 3 year production build-up period. Construction management
will be the responsibility of TEXCO's Project Implementation Unit (PIU) which
will deal with all matters such as finance, cost accounting, transportation,
and storage of equipment. PIU will be assisted by a Project Advisory Firm
(PAF) and a Project Engineering Firm (PEF) which will be appointed in con-
sultation with the Bank. Under the overall management responsibility of PIU,
PAF will be responsible for supervising the project. PAF functions will
include: (a) preparation of a project execution plan based on modern critical
path concepts; (b) screening, evaluation, and selection of consultants and
contractors; (c) coordination and monitoring of the work program of consult-
ants and contractors; (d) preparation of periodic progress reports as required
by TEXCO and the Bank; (e) review and approval of billing submitted by con-
sultants and contractors; and (f) supervision of procurement. PAF will be
provided with staff and office facilities required to fulfill its duties and
will be assisted as appropriate by TEXCO's corporate staff who will provide
necessary engineering, legal and accounting services. PIU will initially be
located at TEXCO's headquarters in Dar-es-Salaam, but will be moved to the
field location in Morogoro by 1979 when housing for them are completed.
5.14      Project design, engineering, procurement, construction and in-
stallation, training of personnel, project start-up, and commissioning will
be carried out through a project engineering contract with a firm (PEF) with
demonstrated competence in these areas. A project implementation schedule
is given in Annex 5-3. TEXCO has selected Toyobo Engineering Co., Ltd. of
Japan as PEF and TOOTAL (U.K.) as PAF. Contracts with these firms are ex-
pected to be signed in June 1978. Orders for equipment are expected to be
placed starting from October 1978.  The total implementation period for the
project is estimated at 44 months. The project is expected to be mechani-
cally complete in September 1981 and to be commissioned by January 1982.
Up to US$500,000 will be allowed as retroactive financing for the services
of PAF and PEF to help expedite project execution. Agreement was reached
that any modification or termination of the contract with PAF and PEF will
be decided with prior consent of the Bank. Signing of contracts with the PAF
and PEF is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank/IDA loan/credit.
H. Staffing and Training
5.15      At full capacity, staff requirement will be:  (a) general management
and office, 120; (b) production management, 225; (c) factory staff, 2,150;



- 30 -
and (d) sales and marketing, 30.  Of the total (2,525), no more than 10 are
expected to be expatriate management and technical personnel; some middle
management, foremen and skilled workers are likely to be drawn from the
existing textile mills with supplemental training to be provided under the
contract with PEF.
5.16      Recruitment of all management and other staff will take place
during construction. It has been agreed that a specific recruitment and
training plan will be submitted by TEXCO for Bank approval by December 31,
197B. A tentative training schedule is given in Annex 5-4. A training
center to serve ithe project will be established at Morogoro as part of the
project to train operators, maintenance personnel, and craftsmen required.
Beciause of its specialized nature, the training center would serve primarily
the proposed project. About 920 operators will be trained prior to the
completion of the project at the training center which will provide short-
termn training courses followed by practical training at the new mill before
final assignment. In addition, about 8 persons will be selected by June 1978
for long-term training in finance and accounting at the local institutes of
finance and development administration. An additional 85 persons for manage-
menl-, engineering, supervision and accounting will be trained abroad. About
56 of them will tndergo long-term training. The first group of candidates for
tra:Lning abroad will be selected in June 1978 and will commence training this
year. The rest will be selected and sent abroad according to the training
program to be prepared by December 1978. TEXCO has agreed that the training
schedule will be worked out in such a way that the trained personnel will be
able to return in time to gain practical experience under the Management
Agency Firm (para 3.29).  They should be able to take over the key functions
of t:he Company once MAF completes its assignment after three years of initial
operations of the project. The total cost of training for the proposed mill
is estimated at US$1.9 million.
I. Quality Control
5.17      Quality control is of crucial importance to ensure higher efficiency
and lower overall operating costs of the project. The proposed quality control
system for the project will include: (a) setting of standards and tolerances
for raw materials, intermediate and finished products; (b) setting of test
procedures; (c) elaboration of a control and testing program with details
and frequencies of tests; and (d) control and the reporting of results to
management.
5.18      In the spinning department, testing will cover all production stages
starting from raw materials through to the wound yarn (before it goes to
weaving). Raw material testing will cover fiber length, fineness, maturity,
strength and the non-lint content. In the weaving department, measures will be
taken to detect fabric defects during weaving. Grey fabrics will be inspected
and graded according to the specified classification. In the processing
department, testing will be made at strategic points to control fabric quality
with respect to the required degree of whiteness, uniformity of dye and color



- 31 -
fastness. Finished fabrics will be inspected and graded as first and second
quality according to the demands of the market and customer. At present the
Tanzanian market is not very sensitive to quality standards due to absence of
competition and shortages of textiles. However, with the provision of train-
ing and testing facilities under the project, the operators of the new mill
are expected to meet better standards of quality than their counterparts in
other mills.
VI. PROJECT COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Project Cost
6.01      The total financing required for the facilities, i.e., for both
the Morogoro Textile Project and the overall technical assistance to TEXCO,
is estimated at US$106.9 million equivalent, including US$2.2 million for
technical assistance to TEXCO. Details of capital cost estimates given in
Annex 6-1 are summarized below:

/a   Including US$1 million of indirect foreign exchange cost.
lb   Including spares.
/c   Including cost of land improvement and housing for expatriates and top
and middle management. Land will be provided by the Government free of
cost.
/d   As in the case of the Mwanza Expansion Project, the current project is
expected to be exempt from duties and taxes. Application for exemption
and approval thereof, however, can only be made after final costs,
based on actual bid quotations, are submitted to the Government.
6.02      The above cost estimates are based on data prepared by TEXCO with
the help of Gherzi using 1977 prices, after a detailed assessment of machinery
and building needs, local conditions of civil work and erection, and require-
ments of technical assistance, training, housing, and transport requirements.



- 33 -
The cost estimates for machinery were prepared from indicative quotations
provided by various prospective suppliers of modern conventional equipment.
The investment cost of this project is somewhat higher than for projects of
the same fabric capacity in some other developing countries because of the
following major factors: (a) provision for production of 650 additional tons
of yarn per year for an existing mill which currently meets its needs from
imports; (b) lack of trained manpower in Tanzania, thus necessitating reliance
on more expensive expatriate assistance for project implementation 1/; (c)
need for training local personnel for positions in production, maintenance,
finance and management in Tanzania and abroad; and (d) need to provide as
part of the project housing for expatriates and top- and middle management
personnel. Physical contingencies of 10% (of the base cost) on civil works
and 4% on the rest is provided for and are considered adequate in view of the
detailed scope of estimates and considering that the project design is based
on standard, readily available textile machinery. Price contingencies are
assumed at 7% in 1978, 6.5% in 1979 and 6% from 1980 onwards on foreign
expenditures. For local expenditures, annual price increases are assumed
at: 8% in 1978, 7.5% in 1979 and 7% in 1980 and thereafter.
6.03       Initial working capital requirements for the project are estimated
at T Sh 120.3 million (US$14.5 million equivalent) excluding the cost of
spares and initial supply of screens for printing which are included under
equipment and material costs. Should initial working capital requirements be
higher than anticipated, the Company is expected to be able to meet it with
short-term credit from the Government-owned National Bank of Commerce.
B. Financing Plan
6.04       The financing plan for the project is based on a 60:40 debt/equity
ratio. Funds for technical assistance to TEXCO (US$2.2 million) are expected
to be provided as equity to TEXCO and are included under the equity figure
shown below. In addition, US$0.7 million in Bank funds will be used to
finance foreign expenditures for the MAF (para 3.29). Since these expend-
itures will form part of the operating expenses of the new company, Bank
financing for such has not been included in the financing plan for the proj-
ect.
1/   The cost of expatriate services is estimated at US$6,500 per man-month
plus a local living allowance of T Sh 300 (US$36) per day.

6.C05     The proposed financing plan includes an offer of US$20 million in
bilateral credit through the Japanese EXIM Bank, with equipment to be pro-
vided by Toyo Menka of Japan. Toyo Menka has submitted a priced proposal to
TEXCO for the supply of spinning and weaving equipment at prices within the
Bank's capital cost estimates. TEXCO is also investigating other possible
sources of bilateral or suppliers' credits for spinning and weaving equipment
in Europe and the U.S. If other agencies are willing to provide equipment
financing (Belgium has already indicated its interest in doing so for weaving
equipment), a bidding procedure would be set up so as to ensure that equipment
is procured at the most attractive combination of prices and credit terms.
It is expected that completion of this process will be achieved in late 1978.
Effectiveness of the bilateral financing sources finally arranged for the
project is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank/IDA loan/credit.
6.06      For present purposes, the Japanese bilateral credit has been used
in preparing the financing plan and financial projections for the project.
The bilateral credit amount (US$20 million equivalent) provides for 80%
financing on the import of US$22.5 million in equipment, plus financing of
interest during construction (US$2 million) on such credit. The credit would
carry an annual interest rate of 8%. Interest, however, does not start
accruing until the date of the last shipment under the credit and payment of
accrued interest is not due until 24 months later. Repayment would be over
eight years with the first installment due at the same time as first interest
payment, representing an effective grace period of about four years. The
grace period thus defers repayment of interest and principal until about July
1982, or six months after scheduled project commissioning. Should the project
be delayed, the Company would borrow short-term from the National Bank of
Commerce (NBC) to meet the first debt service obligations. No problem is



- 35 -
foreseen in obtaining short-term financing from NBC. In fact, the Japanese
bilateral credit would require a guarantee from NBC. The annual guarantee fee
charged by NBC to the Company would be 2% of the outstanding credit amount.
6.07      The Tanzania Investment Bank (TIB) has agreed in principle to
provide US$10 million in foreign exchange for the project. The Government
would provide additional funds if TIB were unable to provide the full amount
required from it (para 6.08). The TIB loan would be used to finance the
downpayment on the bilateral credit, amounting to US$4.5 million, and also to
finance most of the foreign component of civil works (US$5.5 million). The
TIB loan is expected to be for 15 years, including 4-1/2 years grace (same
repayment and grace period as for the Bank loan) with an annual rate of
interest of 11% and a 1% commitment fee on the undisbursed amount. Further,
TIB charges a 1% commission on the loan, payable at the time of loan signing.
Approval of the TIB loan by its Board is expected in June 1978. Effectiveness
of the TIB loan is a condition of effectiveness of the Bank/IDA loan/credit.
6.08      The proposed IDA credit of US$20 million would be made to the Gov-
ernment on standard IDA terms, and will be channelled to the Company through
TEXCO, part in loan (US$8.5 million) and part in equity (US$9.5 million), in
order to help satisfy the 60:40 debt/equity ratio prescribed for the project.
The remaining US$2 million of the IDA credit will be made available to TEXCO
to finance the technical assistance program. Based on country reasons, the
proposed Bank loan of US$25 million would be made to the Government for a
period of 20 years, including 5 years' grace. All Bank/IDA funds onlent by
the Government to the Company would carry an annual interest rate of 10%,
with repayment over 15 years including 4-1/2 years' grace. The repayment
period is two years longer than that granted under the Mwanza Expansion
Project (Loan No. 1128-TA) and reflects the fact that the present project
is a completely new venture while the latter was largely an expansion of
existing facilities. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by the Company.
A portion of the Bank/IDA funds will be used to: (a) finance interest during
construction (US$3.6 million) on the amount onlent by the Government to the
Company, and (b) to finance part of the local construction costs under ICB
(US$9.4 million). All of the Government's own funds for the project (US$32.6
million) will be provided as equity, with installments to be made according
to an agreed time schedule. Should there be any need for additional funds to
complete the project, the Government has agreed to provide such funds in line
with the financial covenants stipulated in para. 7.09.
C. Procurement
6.09      Except for interest during construction, goods and services financed
by the Bank/IDA will be procured through international competitive bidding
(ICB) in accordance with the Bank's guidelines except: (a) items costing less
than US$100,000 equivalent but not exceeding the aggregate amount of US$2
million may be purchased through international shopping on the basis of suit-
ability, availability and price considerations following approval by the Bank
of the proposed list of items involved; and (b) proprietary items and items
in limited supply which are critical to the timely completion of the project



- 36 -
and whose aggregate cost is estimated not to exceed US$1 million may be
procured following bidding from a list of qualified suppliers, with prior
Bank approval.
6.10      There are no local companies manufacturing textile machinery and,
therefore, no local bids under ICB are expected. The initial imported raw
materials, which will be financed by the Bank, will also be procured through
ICB in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Equipment preallocated for the
Japanese or other bilateral or suppliers' credits would be procured according
to t:he procurement guidelines of the agency or agencies involved. Local
procurement and civil works wholly financed by the Government will be carried
out according to the guidelines specified by the Government and TIB, which are
acceptable to the Bank. However, about 58% of civil works (excluding site
development and housing) will be financed with Bank/IDA funds. Contracting
for civil works to be financed with Bank/IDA funds will be done under ICB
procedures following Bank guidelines, with local contractors being given a
7.5%: preference.
D.   Allocation of Bank/IDA Funds
6.11      Allocation of Bank/IDA funds is shown below.  This schedule is

6.12      The Bank/IDA funds would be disbursed as follows:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures for imported equipment and
spares, and freight and insurance, erection and start-up
costs on imported equipment financed by Bank/IDA funds;
(b) 100% of foreign expenditures on engineering services, study
and training, and technical assistance to TEXCO;
(c) 78% of local and 15% of foreign expenditures for civil
works (excluding site development and housing);
(d) 100% of foreign expenditures for the importation of raw
materials for initial operations; and
(e) 100% of foreign expenditures to finance interest during
construction on Bank/IDA.
6.13      Based on the table in para. 6.11, about 20% of Bank Group funds
would be disbursed against local expenditures (for civil works). Retroactive
financing for engineering services, training, and foreign expenditures for
bid advertisements would be allowed up to US$500,000 equivalent for project
expenditures incurred after March 1, 1978. A disbursement schedule for the
Bank Group funds is given in Annex 6-2.
VII. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND RISKS
A.   Production and Production Costs
7.01      As mentioned earlier, the project is expected to be commissioned
in January 1982 and the production build-up is forecast as follows: 1982
50%; 1983, 75%; 1984, 90%; and 1985 and onwards, 100% of effective capacity.
These capacity utilization projections are based on effective capacity which
is conservatively assumed at 85% and 75% of the rated capacity of the spinning
and weaving mills respectively. As is common in the textile industry, and
noted in para 5.02, the processing department will have a higher capacity than
the weaving department to take care of seasonal peaks, changes in patterns,
colors and styles. Based on the above considerations and the provisions made
for training and expatriate operational assistance during the first three
years of operation, the capacity utilization projections are considered
realistic. At full production in 1985, the project will produce nearly 21.5
million sq/m of blend fabrics (65% polyester/ cotton shirtings, twills and
drills; and 35% polyester/rayon suitings) and 650 tons of polyester/rayon yarn
for outside sale to the Arusha mill of KILTEX which, as mentioned previously,
meets its requirements of such yarn currently from imports.
7.02      Assumptions for financial projections are given in Annex 7-1.  Pro-
duction costs are based on estimates prepared by consultants (Gherzi) which
have been reviewed by the Bank and found realistic. An overall 65/35 blend
ratio has been assumed for the fabric production. The cost of cotton to the
mill, as is the practice in Tanzania, has been taken to be the same as the



- 38 -
f.o.b. export price for cotton. The cost of polyester, rayon and other
imported raw materials to the mill are based on c.i.f. prices of such products
plus current import duties, and transport handling and inland transportation
charges. Labor costs are based on detailed manning schedules, minimum wage
rates, and analysis of the payroll costs in other textile companies in the
country. Utility costs are based on prevailing unit rates in Tanzania.
Maintenance costs are estimated at 1.5% of the installed cost. Depreciation
cost is calculated on the assumed 15-year life of the project. Insurance cost
is assumed at 0.5% of the installed cost of the project. At full production
in 1985, raw material costs would account for about 50% of the total produc-
tion costs including depreciation and financial charges which together repre-
sent about 25% of the costs.
B.   Project Revenue
7.03      As noted, prices of textiles, as a basic consumer good, are set by
the Government in consultation with TEXCO and are reviewed every six months or
so. Under the current practice, the ex-factory realization is generally based
on the production costs (including depreciation) plus a profit margin of about
8% at efficient operation (at 90% effective capacity utilization). However,
for new projects which involve comparatively high investment, the Government
allows a 30-40% pre-tax return (15-20% after tax) on total capital employed
(long-term debt plus share capital and retained earnings) on a case-by-case
basis. For the project, it is assumed that the Government will allow at least
a 30% pre-tax return on capital employed at efficient operation (i.e. at 90%
effective capacity utilization). For revenue projections, the price required
to ensure a 30% pre-tax return in 1984, the first year of expected 90% effec-
tive capacity utilization, is used with the assumption that the price will
remain constant in real terms during the life of the project. Agreement
has been reached that the Government will ensure that, at efficient opera-
tions, the new company will obtain sufficient revenue to cover all its costs,
service all its debt and earn a reasonable return on its invested capital.
C.   Methodology Used in Financial Projections
7.04      In order to reflect a reasonably accurate picture of the Company's
financial obligations during the construction phase and cash generation
and liquidity situation during the early years of operation, the financial
projections are made in current prices through 1985 (the first year of full
production) and, thereafter, in constant prices. The fabric prices in cur-
rent terms are projected to increase at a rate of 7% a year from the 1977
levels whereas the operating costs are escalated at expected price increases
for each item: cotton, 7%; polyester, 5% 1/; rayon, 4%; dyestuffs and sizing
materials, 7%; labor and overheads, 7%. Depreciation and financial charges
are not escalateid since they relate to capital costs that remain in the
Company books at historical values. For the purposes of financial rate of
return calculations, the current cost and benefit streams used until 1985
are deflated using a common deflator.
1/   From 1983 onwards.  For 1977-1982, a higher rate of increase (10.5%
a year) is uased as the present polyester price is depressed and is
expected to recover during the next five years.

D.   Future Profitability
7.05      Detailed income and cash flow projections for the project are given
in Annexes 7-2 and 7-3 respectively, and the selected indicators are shown
below:

7.06      The Company will be building up its production during 1982-85 with
full production expected to be reached in 1985.  The 1985 results, therefore,
could be considered typical with respect to the future profitability of the
Company. The net profit as a percentage of sales is projected to reach 19.7%
in 1985; thereafter, this ratio is expected to increase, since financial
charges are expected to decrease. The Company is not expected to declare
dividends during the initial phase of production build-up but only in 1984
(and onward), when the net profit as a percentage of sales would be about 17%.
Cash generation increases from T Sh 54 million (US$6.6 million equivalent) in
1982 (three months of operation) to T Sh 169 million (US$20.4 million equiva-
lent) in 1985.
E.   Financial Position
7.07       Balance sheet projections for 1982-1990 are contained in Annex 7-4
and significant indicators for selected years are shown below:
Selected Indicators of Financial Position
1982    1983    1984    1985    1988    1990
Current Ratio                      1.5      1.9     1.7      1.5      1.5      1.8
Debt/Equity Ratio                 55/45   49/51   41/59   33/67   12/88   4/96
Debt Service Coverage (Times)   1.3         2.0     2.8      3.6      4.5      7.4
7.08      The debt/equity ratio will steadily decline from 60/40 at project
completion in 1981 (i.e. just before commissioning in January 1982) to 4/96
in 1990, reflecting satisfactory cash generation and repayment of debt. The
current ratio would not be less than 1.5:1 at any time, showing a satisfactory
liquidity position of the Company even during the initial years of operation
(1982-1984) when full benefits from the project cannot yet be realized. The



- 40 -
project is expected to generate from the beginning enough cash to more than
meet its debt service requirements. From an acceptable level of 1.3 times
in 1982 (when accrued interest and the first principal repayment on the
Japanese bilateral credit fall due), debt service coverage is expected to
improve substanltially thereafter.
F.   Financial Covenants
7.09      In order to ensure a sound financial situation of the project,
the following agreements similar to those under the Mwanza Project (1128-TA)
have been reached: (a) the Morogoro Company will maintain at all times a
current ratio of at least 1.5:1 and a debt/equity ratio not exceeding 60/40;
and (b) the Company will not declare or pay any dividends if by so doing the
debt service coverage would fall below 1.5 times. In addition, the Company
will exchange views with the Bank for three years after the project completion
before undertaking any investment not related to the project, involving an
expenditure exceeding US$5 million annually.
G.   Break-Even Point
7.10      In 1985, at full production, the profit break-even point for the
Company would be about 40% of the effective capacity. Alternatively, the
average sales prices at full capacity could fall by 39% before the Company
would show a loss. In 1985, since debt repayment of US$6.4 million is approx-
imately equal to the total depreciation charges, the cash break-even point
would be close to the profit break-even point.
H.   Financial Rate of Return
7.11      The cost and benefit streams for the financial (internal) rate of
return are expressed in real 1977 prices as shown in Annex 7-5. The return
is satisfactory at 18.9% before and 12.8% after income taxes (which are cur-
rently 50% of income and are assumed to remain at this level for the life of
the project).
7.12      Sensitivity tests have been conducted (Annex 7-5) to determine
the financial rate of return under various assumptions and the results are
summarized below:
Sensitivity Tests on Financial Rate of Return (IRR)
Case                                       Before Tax              After Tax
IRR (%)                 IRR (%)
Base Case                                           18.9                   12.8
Sales Revenue Decrease by 10%                       15.6                   10.7
Capital Cost Increase by 10%                        17.4                   11.7
Operating Cost Increase by 10%                      17.4                   11.4
Six months project delay & 80%
Capacity Utilization                               17.0                   10.8



- 41 -
The above sensitivity tests indicate that even under moderately adverse cir-
cumstances, the project shows acceptable rates of return. The IRR is more
sensitive to changes in sales revenue than in operating and capital costs.
It would drop to 15.6 if sales revenue fell by 10%, while it declines to
17.4% if either the operating or capital costs increased by 10%. Further, a
six-month delay in project implementation combined with the eventual attain-
ment of only 80% capacity utilization, would reduce the return to 17.0%.
However, the likelihood of the above occurrences is low because of: (a) the
Government's agreed policy to maintain ex-factory prices at remunerative
levels at efficient production; (b) the involvement of experienced firms in
project implementation and initial operation; and (c) the provision for a
comprehensive training program for the local people.
I.   Auditing and Reporting Requirements
7.13      It is mandatory in Tanzania that the audit of all parastatal compa-
nies should eventually be carried out by the Tanzania Audit Corporation (TAC)
which was established in 1968. The number of such companies audited by TAC
has increased gradually to 270 out of the total of 320 parastatal companies
in Tanzania. TAC's audit reports are submitted directly to the Board Chairman
of the parastatal company concerned with copies to the parent Ministry and
the Treasury. Agreement has been reached that the Company will submit to the
Bank audit reports of TAC within four months of the end of the year and give
prompt attention to audit recommendations. Further, to facilitate the work
of TAC and effective financial management of the project, the Company will
train and employ competent accounting personnel to prepare the accounts
satisfactorily. In addition to the annual audit reports, the Company will
submit quarterly financial statements and project progress and procurement
status reports within 45 calendar days after each quarter. Finally, after
completion of the project, the Company will prepare and furnish to the Bank a
comprehensive report on the project, its implementation, initial operation,
and the costs and benefits derived and expected to be derived therefrom.
J.   Risks
7.14      The project could face some risks because of the tendency in
Tanzania to replace expatriates by local people before the latter are ade-
quately trained, and also the general shortage of trained manpower in the
country. However, the management risk is minimized with the involvement of
experienced international firms during implementation and initial operations
of the project, and the provision for training potential Tanzanian management
personnel abroad in a timely manner. Further, the project is not likely to
suffer from lack of operators and craftsmen as a training center to train
such personnel has been included as part of the project. The technical risk
in the project is minimal since the technology used is a proven one which
has been in commercial use since the 1960's. The market risk is also minimal
since the project is favorably located with respect to the market area and
the project's output is expected to be easily absorbed by the market. Avail-
ability of foreign exchange for the import of raw materials and spares is not
expected to be a constraint since the Government gives priority in foreign



- 42 -
exchange allocation to the import of raw materials and spares and has agreed
to make satisfactory arrangements for the timely importation of such (para.
5.08). Further, product pricing is not a serious issue as the Government
intends to ensure a reasonable return on capital employed at efficient opera-
t ion.
VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.   Raw Material and Textile Prices
8.01      In calculating the economic rate of return, capital costs, operating
costs and benefits have been evaluated at long-term prices expressed in con-
stant 1977 terms. Taxes have been excluded from all cost and benefit calcu-
lations. Tradable items are valued at their c.i.f. border price, expressed
in local currency at the official exchange rate; and non-tradable items are
valued at local cost excluding taxes and other transfer payments. No shadow
rates are used for labor and foreign exchange in the "base case" economic
rate of return calculation. Power and water rates have been charged at the
prevailing rate. Local raw materials like cotton are valued at their f.o.b.
exporting prices (Dar-es-Salaam). Imported raw materials (e.g. polyester,
rayon, etc.) are valued at their delivered prices at Morogoro. Cotton price
assumptions are based on the Bank price forecasts 1/ for the Mexican SM 1-1/16"
cotton. As the Tanzanian variety, Mwanza No. 1, which will be used by the
project commands a premium of 15% over the Mexican variety, this adjustment
has been made in projecting the price of Mwanza No. 1 cotton. The following
table shows the price assumptions for the project's main raw materials:
Economic Prices of Main Raw Materials
(US cents/lb)
In Current Prices              In Constant 1977 Prices

- 43 -
8.02      Because of the recent tight world cotton supply situation, the cot-
ton prices have been above the long-run level since mid-1975. However, by
the early 1980's, more adequate supplies relative to demand are expected to
bring the price of cotton to its long-run level of about 60 US cents/lb. at
1977 constant prices for Mexican SM 1-1/16" cotton (f.o.b., exporting coun-
try) and 75.5 US cents/lb for the Tanzanian Mwanza No. 1 variety. On the
other hand, the current world price of polyester (54 US cents/lb, c.i.f.
Northern Europe) is below the long-run price because of temporary oversupply.
This situation is expected to change in the future as demand for polyester is
increasing and polyester's share in the world consumption of fibers continues
rising. As a result, polyester prices are expected to rise to the long-term
level of about 81 US cents/lb (c.i.f., importing countries) or 70-75 US
cents/lb (f.o.b., exporting countries) by 1983 in constant 1977 prices. As
for rayon, it is facing keen competition from stronger fibers like polyester
and its price is not likely to show any significant increase in 1977 constant
prices.
8.03      The final products of the project are based on long-term c.i.f.
prices (in Northern Europe) expressed in real 1977 terms. The prices are
based on recent (1977) forecasts by consultants; they were reviewed by the
Bank and found realistic. The economic product prices assumed are given
below:

B.   Economic Rate of Return
8.04      Based on the price assumptions outlined above and assuming a 15-
year life for the project, the economic rate of return of the project is
estimated at 19.2%. Annex 7-5 shows the investment cost, operating cost
and benefit streams used for the economic rate of return calculation. Sen-
sitivity tests carried out on the economic rate of return show the following
results:

Sales Revenue Decrease by 10%                                    16.1

Unskillecd Labor                                               19.7
The rate of return is more sensitive to changes in revenue than in operating
and investment costs. However, under all moderately adverse circumstances,
the rate of return does not fall to an unacceptably low level. Further,
the economic rate of return for a hypothetical all-cotton fabric project
of production capacity comparable to that of the proposed project would be
lower by 4 percentage points because the operating costs would be at least
10%' higher and revenue would be 10% lower while there would be no significant
difference in caLpital costs for the hypothetical all-cotton project.
C.   Foreign Exchange Effects
8.05      The foreign exchange effects of the project are very favorable.
Considering the financing obtained from international sources, there will
be no net foreign exchange outflow due to the project during its implemen-
tation. Following the plant's commissioning, the foreign investment costs
will be recovered rapidly. By 1985, four years after commissioning of the
prcject, accumulated net foreign exchange savings from import substitution
to the Tanzanian economy are expected to exceed the net foreign investment
costs in real 1977 prices. After reaching full capacity in 1985, the project
is forecast to generate at 1977 prices, net foreign exchange savings of over
US$20 million per year. An analysis of the domestic resource cost of the
foreign exchange savings is presented in Annex 8. Assuming that the oppor-
tunity cost of capital in Tanzania is 10% and the shadow rate of exchange is
T Sh 12 = US$1, the efficiency of import substitution works out to 0.35. In
other words, the domestic resource cost for every dollar of foreign exchange
saved is US$0.35 equivalent. Thus, the project represents a good scheme to
transform domestic resources into foreign exchange savings. Further, the net
annual foreign exchange savings from a hypothetical all-cotton fabric project
of comparable capacity to that of the proposed project would be about US$4
million lower.
D.   Economic Importance of Blended Fabrics
8.06      There is a growing realization in the world that the most economic
way of clothing a nation is with blended fabrics. The reasons are: (a)
lower waste factor in the use of man-made fibers in fabric production; (b)



- 45 -
two to three times more durability of blended fabrics; and (c) easy care
and anti-crease properties of dresses made from blended fabrics which could
be "drip-dried" soon after washing even in countries which do not have tumble
drying facilities, and worn immediately afterwards without need for ironing.
The advantages of blended fabric production over all-cotton fabric production
even in a country which produces cotton but not man-made fibers could be sig-
nificant as reflected in the following table which compares the raw material
costs at long-term border prices expressed in 1977 constant prices for the
proposed project to produce blended fabrics with those for a hypothetical
all-cotton mill in Tanzania:
Comparative Raw Material Costs of Blend Fabric
Vs. All-Cotton Fabric Project

Total Cotton Cost (US$ m.)                         1.81              9.45
Total Polyester Cost (US$ m.)                      5.70               -
Total Rayon Cost (US$ m.)                          1.10               _
Total Raw Material Cost (US$ m.)                   8.61              9.45
a/   Based on prices as explained in paras 8.01 and 8.02.
The above table shows that to produce 21.5 million sq/m, the raw material
cost in Tanzania would be nearly 10% lower in the blended fabric project than
in the hypothetical all-cotton fabric project, even if we assume that all-
cotton and blended fabrics were of comparable properties in all respects.
However, as explained above, these fabrics differ in their main properties.
For example, even if the blended fabric is conservatively considered to be
only twice as durable as the cotton fabric, the production of 21.5 million
sq/m of blended fabric is equivalent to 43 million sq/m of all-cotton fab-
rics. In other words, the establishment of one blended fabric project to pro-
duce 21.5 million sq/m is comparable to the establishment of an all-cotton
fabric project to produce 43 million sq/m for which the capital cost as well
as the raw material costs required would be substantially higher than for the
blended fabric project.
E.   Impact on Garment Industry and Employment Generation
8.07      The direct employment generated by the project would be about 2,525.
In addition, the project is expected to create significant employment indi-
rectly, and help utilize more fully the existing idle capacity in the garment

industry. As noted before, this is due to the fact that, because of serious
foreign exchange difficulties, the Government of Tanzania has reduced drasti-
cally the import: of blended fabrics as well as ready-made garments. With the
project helping to overcome this supply constraint, a number of small-scale
unilts (employing less than 10 persons) and tailoring shops are expected to
spring up in different parts of the country.  As a result, at least 1,500
jobs are expected to be created in the garment sector which should resume its
position as one of the fastgrowing sectors in Tanzania to keep up with the
expansion of textile production. The additional investments required in the
garment sector on account of the textile production from the new project is
not: likely to exceed US$5-10 million. Considering the total investment and
the total employment generation -- direct and indirect -- in the textile and
garment sectors, the investment per worker would be about US$27,700.  In this
corLtext, it is to be noted that the project will also stimulate indirect
employment in wholesale and retail trade, transport and distribution, but this
has not been considered here.
F.   Regional Impact of the Project
8.08      Morogoro is one of the nine towns selected by the Government for
development as "'growth centers" to relieve the population pressure on major
urban areas, especially Dar-es-Salaam, and ensure balanced regional develop-
ment.  Because of its proximity to the capital city and major ports, and its
location along the major road and rail transport routes linking it to most
parts of the country, Morogoro has the potential for becoming a new indus-
trial and commercial center. The proposed project as well as the Morogoro
Industrial Estate project previously financed by the Bank (1386-TA) will help
realize this potential, and stimulate the growth of an underdeveloped region
which in 1969 had a per capita income of T Sh 567 (US$68) compared to
T Sh 4,268 (US$514) in Dar-es-Salaam.
G.   Transfer of Technology and Skills
8.C9      The proposed project will be producing polyester/cotton fabrics
for the first time in the country and will be the first major producer of
polyester/rayon fabrics. The project will help transfer modern but con-
ventional technology and skills to Tanzania, through training and technical
assistance.
H.   Institution Building
8.10      A training center will be established as part of the project to
train about 920 operators, maintenance workers, and craftsmen per year. This
center would be geared to meet the trained personnel needs of the new project.
Furthermore, the project would have an impact on the sector by providing TEXCO
with technical assistance to recommend and implement a rehabilitation program
for existing mills and to strengthen TEXCO management.

Assumptions Used:
Projections for URAFIKI are based on capacity utilization of
90% and the addition of 216 to the existing 978 looms in mid-1977.  Capacity
build up of the additional looms: 70%-1978, 90%-1979 and thereafter.
Prcjections for KILTEX are based on the planned implementation of a
balancing, modernization and expansion program in late 1978 and 1979.
Prc'duction, therefore, is not expected to show significant improvement
until 1980. Capacity utilization of the expanded facilities are
assumed as follows: 70%-1980, 90%-1981 and thereafter, MWATEX projections
assume Droduction from existing facilities at about 2 million sq/m below
1977 levels until completion of the rehabilitation program in the first
quarter of 1977. Capacity utilization is forecast as follows: 75% in
1979,and 90% in 1980 and thereafter.   For the MWATEX expansion,
commissioning is scheduled for July 1978. The expansion plant is
estimated to produce at 50% in 1978, 75% in 1979, and 90% in 1980 and
following years. SUNGURATEX increased its capacity in October 1977
by 8.4 million sq/m. Additional capacity is assumed to be utilized 50%
in 1978, 75% in 1979, and 90% in 1980 and thereafter. For the existing
capacity, which ran at 57% utilization in 1977, improvement is assumed
as follows:  70%-1978, 80%-1979, 90%-1980 and following years.  MUSOMA,
a new plant of 22 million sq/m capacity, is expected to be ready for
commissioning in mid-1980. The assumed capacity build-up is: 50% through
1981, 75% in 1982, and 90% from 1983 onwards.  MBEYA, plans for which are
still being finalized, is expected to be commissioned in mid-1982. Capacity
of 25 million sq//m is assumed to be utilized at the following rates: 50%
through 1983, 75% in 1984, and 90% in 1985 and thereafter. Only a portion
of the output will be sold domestically since 7 million sq/m annually is
to be exported to the German Democratic Republic  under long term contract.
Exports are deducted in the above table to arrive at production available
for the local market.

of 4% (compounded from an estimated growth rate of 1.2X in 1975 and a Bank projected annual growth rate of 4.6% during 1976
-80); population growth rate 2.8% p.a., per capita income growth rate 1.2% p.a. Assumed Income elasticities of demand:
1.0 for all woven textiles, 0.85 for cotton textiles, 1.75 for textiles of or blended with man-made fibers. For the
period 1981-85, average annual growth rate of GNP 5.4% (Bank pKojection), population growth rate 2.8% p.a., per capita in-
come growt  rate 2.6% p.a.  Astsumed income elasticities of demand:  1.1  for all woven textiles, 0.7. for cotton textiles,
2.9  for textiles of or blended with man-made fibers.  For the minimum projections no allowance has been made for unsatis-
fied demand; maximum projections, however, include an allowance for unsatisfied demand estimated at 20.9 million sq.m. (19    x
million linear meters) in 1974 for all woven textiles, 16.9 million sq.m. for cotton textiles and 4 million sq.m. for tex-
tiles of man-made fibers.

1/   Based on projected output of TEXCO mills (see  Table 4-3   1) and an assumed moderate increase in produttion at the other mills
and blanket factories from a combined 5.9 million sq/m   in 1976 to 8.0 million sq/m   in 1980 and thereafter.
2/  Assumed production increase takes into account planned expansion of KILTEX's Arusha mill to increase polyester fabric production from 1.5 to 4.0
million sq/m by 1981, and only an insignificant expansion of output at the two private mills. The projection also assumes that the proposed
project would start production in 1982 at 50% of its capacity of 21.Fmillion sq/m.  The production of the proposed project would subsequently
increase to reach full capacity utilization with 21.5 million sq/m by 1985.

TANZANIA: MOROGORO TEXTILE PROJECT
PROJECT TECHNOLOGY AND SIZE
I. PROJECT TECHNOLOGY
A. Background
1.        Basically, the technologies available for a textile mill can be
grouped under three main categories: (a) pre-conventional technology
(PCT) based on narrow mechanical (semi-automatic) looms and direct spinning;
(b) conventional technology (CT) based on broad automatic looms and ring
spinning; and (2) advance technology (AT) based on devices like automatic
opening of blow rooms, chute-fed high speed carding machines, open spinning,
unifils and electronically-operated shuttleless looms which are being used
in the developed countries to economize on labor in the face of rapidly
rising labor costs.
2.        For th,e Morogoro Textile Project, the above technology alterna-
tiv,es were considered and the CT alternative has been found the most
economical for Tanzanian conditions with respect to spinning and weaving
facilities, which account for about 85% of the total investment cost of the
project.  For the converting (finishing) facility which accounts for 15% of
the total project cost, the AT alternative is considered most economic as
the rationale for using it is not to save on labor but to achieve better
efficiency in the processing of fabrics while, at the same time, reduce
water, fuel,dyestuff and chemicals consumption. The savings in material
cosi:s (about 20%) possible from the use of AT at only marginal increase in
cap:ital costs, has made such technology standard in new textile plants for
the converting operation. There is virtually no saving on labor regardless
of whether AT or older technology is used for such operation.
3.        For spinning and weaving operations, the main aim of the use of
AT is to save on labor, such technology was not considered for the Morogoro
Project. After detailed analysis of PCT and CT alternatives, CT technol-
ogy is recommended as it showed definite advantages over PCT with respect to:
(i) capital costs; (ii) operating costs; (iii) training costs; (iv) produc-
tioin of wider, finer, high-density fabrics of uniform quality; and (v) raw
material consumption per unit of production. Further, it should be noted
thal: PCT technology is in use in some countries mostly in smaller textile
units organized under single proprietors or partnerships. But in larger
firms, CT techno:Logy is predominantly used. Some countries, especially
India, which has a long tradition of textile production, have been slow in
the switchover from PCT to CT technology in spite of economic advantages of
doing so, because of the Government policy of protecting employment in mills
which were established decades ago based on PCT technology. However, in
larger textile mills established in the recent past, CT technology is used
even in India.
B. Weaving
4.        The economic superiority of CT over PCT technology comes out
clearly from the following analysis of CT and PCT looms.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 2
5.        Loom Speed:  A CT loom operates 35-45% faster than a PCT loom of
the same width. Using this factor alone, approximately 1.4 PCT looms would
be required to produce the same amount of fabric as a single CT loom in a
given period of time.
6.        Loom Efficiency:  Loom efficiency is defined as "the percentage
of time a loom is actually weaving as opposed to being idle for resupplying
yarn or repairing yarn breakage." In the use of PCT loom, it has to be
stopped 12 to 30 times per loom hour for manually replenishing weft yarn
alone by changing bobbins, whereas, in the CT loom bobbins are changed
automatically without any stoppages for replenishing weft yarn. It is esti-
mated that the time taken by a weaver on a PCT loom to feed it with a fresh
supply of weft yarn is 4 to 10 minutes per loom hour (for average counts
usually woven on PCT looms) which is not required on the CT loom. In addi-
tion, loom interference on the PCT loom is at least 3 minutes per loom hour.
Considering these factors, at least 7 minutes are lost per loom hour in the
PCT loom resulting in a relative disadvantage in efficiency of 12%. Using
efficiency factors of about 82.5% and 70.5% for CT and PCT looms respectively,
the CT loom would have an advantage over the PCT loom of about 1.17 times.
Like loom speed, this must be taken into account when comparing the number
of PCT looms required to match the output of a single CT loom.
7.        Fabric Rejection Rate:  The fabric rejection rate is the proportion
of fabric production that does not pass the quality control inspection. In
the PCT loom, when it has to be stopped 12 to 30 times per loom hour for
reasons explained earlier, marks on the fabric are left by the PCT loom
because of the relaxation of the warp yarn during the loom stoppages. As a
result, the fabric rejection rate is higher in the use of the PCT loom than
in the case of the CT loom. For medium to fine quality fabric, under good
quality control supervision, the fabric rejection rate would be about 2.5%
and 8% for the CT and PCT looms respectively when both are operated by
highly skilled labor. In a country like Tanzania, where skilled labor is
scarce and no long tradition of weaving exists, the fabric rejection rate
would be at least 5% and 25% respectively for the CT and PCT looms. Assum-
ing that the rejected fabric could be sold at one-half the value of the
standard quality fabric, in order to obtain the same value output as from a
single CT loom, 1.11 PCT looms would be required.
8.        Investment Cost:  Considering the above factors, about 1.79 PCT
loom would be required to get comparable operational results from one CT
loom. Using US$6,50011 and US$2,530 as the approximate purchase prices for
CT and PCT looms, about US$4,530 has to be invested in PCT looms to get
comparable results from one CT loom costing US$6,500. However, the invest-
ment in looms is not the only investment in the weaving mill. The investment
cost per loom should also include the cost of buildings, technical installa-
tions, freight and handling, erection, training, etc.
1/ It was US$3,430 per CT loom for the NWATEX Expansion Project being
financed by the Bank in Tanzania.



ANNEX 5-1
Page 3
9.        For the proposed mill in Tanzania, the number of CT looms required
is estimated at 664. If PCT looms were to be used in that mill, the number
of such looms would be about 1,188 (1.79 times the CT looms) to produce the
given quantity of fabrics, i.e., 21.5 million sq/m per year. Because of the
need for higher number of PCT looms required, the built-area required for
the mill would be larger, involving higher civil works cost. It is estimated
that the civil works and technical installations cost per loom is about
US$7,350 in Tanzania. In addition, the importation of 1,188 PCT looms as
against 664 CT looms involves higher freight and erection costs. Further,
the number of weavers required for 1,188 PCT looms would be about 1,3061/
compared to 182-2'for 664 CT looms. Therefore, the training cost for weavers
for a PCT-based mill would be about 7 times higher in Tanzania as trained
weavers are in short supply. Considering all these factors, the investment
cost on tbe weaving mill for the proposed project would be about US$19 million
if it were based on PCT looms compared to US$15 million for the CT loom-based
mill.
10.       Operating Costs:  Operating costs would also be higher in the PCT
loom-based mill as the yarn consumption rate, total labor, utility and
maintenance costs would be higher in such a mill than in a CT loom-based
mill.
C. Spinning
11.       Yarn for weaving is produced by spinning mills.  The established
CT method for spinning is ring spinning which has been widely used in the
world because of its definite advantages (e.g., higher speed, lower down-
time, higher production efficiency and better yarn quality) over the PCT
method of direct spinning. As a result, the PCT method of spinning has
been found uneconomic and has been phased out in many developed as well
as developing countries.
12.       Under the older methods of spinning (using flyer, mule, cap, etc.)
the bobbin (package of yarn) is used directly in the weaving shuttle. This
practice limits the size of the bobbin and causes problems with respect to
quality and efficiency in weaving due to variation in yarn tension and
yarn quality. Under the CT method (i.e., ring spinning), the bobbins are
of larger size and are wound into pirns and are set into the battery of the
CT loom to be carried by the shuttle while weaving.
13.       Because of the above reasons, ring spinning has been recommended
for the Morogoro Project.
1/ Assuming one weaver per 4 PCT loom, 4 shifts of operation and 10% absenteeism.
2/ Assuming one weaver per 16 CT loom, 4 shifts of operation and 10% absenteeism.

II. PROJECT SIZE
14.       The size of the project, which is designed to produce 21.5
million sq/m (19 million lm) of blended fabrics, has been carefully
considered in relation to market needs, economies of scale, and
availability of financing.
15.       Market Needs:  The market demand for blended fabrics in Tanzania
is estimated at 24 million sq/m in 1977, and is expected to rise to 46
million sq/m by 1985. The proposed project would meet only part of this
demand (46% in 1985). Any reduction in scale would aggrevate the
already severe supply deficit which,if demand were to be satisfied,
would have to be met by costly imports. Assuming a plant size of only
10 million lm, net foreign exchange savings in 1985 (the first year of
full production) would be only US$10.4 million in 1977 prices, compared
to US$25.4 million with the plant size as proposed.
16.       Economies of Scale:  A smaller plant would substantially
reduce the economic and financial rate of return for the project.
Because costs of technical services are largely fixed and much of the
preparatory and processing equipment and associated civil works
cannot be sized-down to match the reduced scale of a smaller plant,
capital costs for a mill producing 10 million lm annually would drop
by only 32% compared to those for the proposed 19.5 million lm facility.
Moreover, operating costs would decrease by only about 42% since labor,
overhead and maintenance costs would not decline in proportion to the
decrease in plant capacity. As a result, the economic rate of return
for the smaller plant (which would produce 48% less revenue) would be
only 13% versus 19% for the plant size proposed.
17.       Elimination of Spinning:  The possibility of reducing project
costs (while maintaining overall scale at 19.5 million lm annually) by
eliminating a component such as spinning was also examined and found to
be uneconomic. The elimination of the spinning mill would reduce
project cost by about US$25 million, or 24% of the total cost estimate.
On the other hand, importing yarn would increase annual operating costs by
US$6.0 million (in 1977 terms) over the cost of producing the yarn
internally. This would reduce the economic rate of return on the
project from 19% to 17%. Moreover, imported yarn would lead to an
additional net outflow of scarce foreign exchange of US$7.6 million annually
over the foreign exchange cost of producing the yarn internally. Reliance
on imported yarn would also reduce the project's flexibility to vary its
product mix in response to changing market demands for different blend
ratios, types and styles of fabric. This is especially so under currently
tight world supply conditions for the polyester blend yarns with the range
of counts required for the project.

ANNEX 7-1
TANZANIA: MOROGORO TEXTILE PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS FOR FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS
A. Price Bases Used
In order to reflect a reasonably accurate picture of the
Company's financial flows during the early years of operation, projections
of both revenues and production costs are made in current prices through
1985 (the first year of full production) and, thereafter in constant
prices.
B. Production Build-up
1.         The project is expected to be commissioned in January 1982 and
the production build-up is forecast as follows: 1982, 50%; 1983, 75%;
1984, 90%; and 1985 and onwards, 100% of effective capacity. These capacity
utilization projections are based on effective capacity which is conservatively
assumed at 85% and 75% of the rated capacity of the spinning and weaving
mills respectively.
C. Revenue
2.         Revenue calculations are based on the average price per linear
meter (lm) required to ensure a 15% after-tax return on total capital
employed (long-term debt plus share capital and retained earnings) at
efficient operation (i.e. 90% capacity utilization). Further, it is assumed
that the average price per lm calculated for the expected first year of
90% capacity utilization (i.e. 1984) would remain constant in real terms
during the life of the project.
D. Variable Production Costs
3.         The following table shows the basis for variable production
cost calculations:

E. Fixed Costs
4.        Maintenance Materials:  Maintenance costs are estimated at 1.5% of
plant installed costs.
5.        Depreciation:  The project life is assumed to be 15 years and straight
line depreciation has been used.
6.        Interest on Short/Term Debt:  It is assumed that the incremental working
capital needs beyond 1983 would be met from short-term borrowings from the
National Bank of Commerce which charges 8.5% on such loans.
7.        Interest on Long-Term Debt: It is based on the assumption that the
Government would onlend Bank/IDA funds to the Company at 10%. Interest
on the TIB loan is 11%. Interest on the bilateral credit is assumed at 8% plus a
2% annual guarantee fee to the National Bank of Commerce.
8.        Salaries and Wages (Including fringe benefits):  Total employees are
estimated at 2,525, including 920 skilled labor, 1,230 unskilled labor and 375
administrative and sales personnel. The salary scales for employees are fixed
by the Government. The minimum wage for labor is T Sh 325 (U$$39) per month.
Salaries and wages have been calculated on the basis of Government pay scales
for different grades of employees. Fringe benefits are assumed at 50% of the
wages ancl salary.



ANNEX 7-1
Page 3
9.        Overhead:  Overhead charges are assumed to be 30% of wages
and salaries.
10.       Insurance:  Insurance cost is assumed to be 0.5% of the
installed cost of the project.
11.       Expatriate Management:  Cost of the Management Agency-Firm (MAF)
which would be appointed six months before commissioning of the project.
MAF services would be used for at least three years. The annual cost of
MAF services is estimated at US$250,000.
F. Tax
12.       The tax rate on company profits is 50% in Tanzania.
G. Dividends
13.       The Company is not expected to pay dividends during the
initial phase of production build-up (1982-83). From 1984 onwards, it is
assumed that 15% of the net profit after taxes would be paid out as
dividends. The dividend payment percentage would be higher if the
Company does not need high retained earnings to finance expansion,
establish subsidiaries, etc.

The opportunity cost of capital in Tanzania is assumed to be about 10%. The efficiency of import substitution (EIS)
would be 0.51 at official exchange rate and 0.35 at shadow exchange rate. Thus, the project represents a good
scheme to traisform domestic resources into foreign exchange savings.
/a    When the opportunity cost of capital is equal to the internal rate of return (IRR), the NPV is zero, DRC is
equaL to the shadow exchange rate and EIS is equal to 1.
