TURKEY
FOURTH TEX TRANSHISSION PROJECT
Loan and Project Summary
Borrower:          Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK)
Guarantor:         RepubLic of Turkey
Amount:            US$142 million equivalent
Terms:             Seventeen years including four years of grace, with
interest at the standard variable rate.
Project            The project would support the further expansion of Turkey's
Description:       transmission grid to acconmodate increased load and
generation capacity. It would support the construction of
about 800 km of 380-kV transmission lines an,d transformer
substations at the 380-kV and 154-kV voltage levels with a
total installed capacity of about 5400 MVA. The project
would also include a tower testing facility, line stringing
equipment, consulting services and training.
Proiect Benefits   The project would be an important component of TEK's system
and Risks:         development program for electricity supply.  Construction
of transmission lines and transformer substations under the
project would allow full utilization of several large
generation plants now under construction. Technical
assistance would be focussed on improving TEK's
capabilities in network engineering and the design of
transmission lines and substations. A physical project
risk would be the possibility that adverse climate and
terrain conditions would delay construction during the
winter. Adequate construction technology is available and
would be used. The engagement of consultants to assist TEK
in project implementation would be a condition of loan
effectiveness.

INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE IBRD
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE TURKISH ELECTRICITY AUTHORITY FOR A
FOURTH TEK TRANSMISSION PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) with the guarantee of the Republic
of Turkey for the equivalent of US$142.00 million to help finance the foreign
exchange cost of a Fourth TEK Transmission Project. The loan would have a
term of seventeen years including four years of grace, with interest at the
standard variable rate.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.       An economic mission visited Turkey in June 1982, and its report
entitled "Turkey: Country Economic Memorandum, Recent Economic Developments
and Medium-Term Prospects" (No. 4287-TU) was distributed to the Executive
Directors in June 1983. The report of a mission to review the financial
sector, entitled: "Turkey: Special Economic Report - Policies for the
Financial Sector" (No. 4459-TU). was distributed in September 1983. A Bank
mission reviewed the Government's Fifth Five-Year Plan (1985-89) in
August/September 1984 and its findings are reflected in this section.
3.       Turkey is about as large as France and Germany combined, with a
population of around 48 million and an estimated GNP per capita of $1230 in
1983. The density of population is low (78 per square kilometer of
agricultural land), and about 47 percent live in urban centers. Population
growth (2.2 percent per annum) is below the median for middle-income
countries. Despite rapid economic growth in the mid-1970s as well as
substantial emigration of workers (to Western Europe and more recently, to the
Middle East), the employment situation has deteriorated steadily with an
unemployment rate currently estimated at about 19 percent. There is, however,
little or no absolute poverty, although income distribution ir skewed. There
are considerable regional differences in income and large rural-urban
disparities. Recent data indicate a probable worsening in income
distribution, especially of wage and salary earners, and a sharp real decline
in average earnings. Educational enrollments have expanded greatly, but the
level of adult literacy remains relatively low.
Background
4.       During the 1970s Turkey did not make the necessary adjustments to the
shocks caused by the steep rise in oil prices, stagflation in the OECD
economies, and the consequent deterioration of its terms of external trade.
1/ Parts I and II are substantially the same as Parts I and II of the
President's Report on the Industrial Schools Project (P-3956-TU), dated
April 18, 1985.



Until 1977 Turkey maintained high rates of economic growth by raising the
share of public investment in GDP. This was financed initially by workers'
remittances and, following the quadrupling of oil prices, increasingly by
short-term borrowings. The rapid GNP growth came to an abrupt halt in 1977 as
the massive external debt burden led to a sharp deterioration in
creditworthiness, severe shortages of imports, and disruptions in industrial
production with a rise in unemployment. By the end of 1979, domestic
inflation had also become an issue of critical importance.
5.       The Turkish authorities' response to the crisis of the late 1970s was
a major shift in development strategy in 1980, moving towards outward
orientation and giving an increased role to market forces.  Policies were
adopted to expand exports and increase workers' remittances whiclh, together
with liberalization of imports, encouragement of foreign investment and
prudent external debt management, were aimed at alleviating the balance of
payments constraint and import shortages. On the domestic front, the
objectives were a reduction in the inflation rate, reform of the State
Economic Enterprises (SEEs), a more efficient financial sector, improved
resource mobilization and better selection of investments, especially in the
public sector.
6.       The adjustment program, which has been supported by the Bank through
five structural adjustment loans, involves far-reaching changes in attitudes,
institutions, and the legal and policy framework, all of which require time to
put in place. Major structural changes have been made in the exchange rate
system, the export and import regimes, the tax system, interest rate and
selective credit policies and the public investment program. Implementation
of the adjustment program was carried out under a military regime during
September 1980 - November 1983 and since then by an elected government.
The Structural Adjustment Program - 1980-84
7.       The Turkish economy has shown an impressive response to the
structural adjustment program and actual performance met or exceeded the
Government's own targets through 1982. By contrast, results in 1983 and 1984
proved to be mixed, due in part to adverse economic developments on the
external front, slippages in the monetary program, a persistent shortfall in
Government revenues and the renewal of inflationary pressures.
8.       Real GNP expanded by 4.1 percent in 1981 and 4.6 percent in 1982.  In
1983, GNP growth slowed down to 3.2 percent, due in large part to the effects
of a bad harvest and a decline in the contribution of the foreign balance.
The growth rate rebounded in 1984 to an estimated 5.7 percent, supported by
favorable performance in the productive sectors with agricultural value added
growing at 3.6 percent and industrial value added at 9.6 percent. Capacity
utilization rates in private industry in 1984 are estimated to bave risen by
about 5 percent to an average rate of 72 percent. On the expenditure side,
the average annual real rate of growth of public fixed investment has been
contained to 3.1 percent over the 1980-84 period while the growth rate of
private investment has improved systematically from -17.3 percent in 1980 to
4.8 percent in 1983 and an estimated 5.4 percent in 1984. Private
consumption, which had actually fallen by 5 percent in 1980, grew at
4.9 percent in 1983 and an estimated 5.0 percent in 1984. On the other hand,
helped by strict budgetary discipline, the rate of growth of public
consumption declined from 8.4 percent in 1980 to 1.8 percent in 1983.
Estimates for 1984 suggest a modest growth of 2.4 percent.



9.       Through 1982, the Government met with considerable success in
reducing the rate of inflation through a combination of fiscal, monetary and
incomes policies. After peaking at 107 percent in 1980, the anrual average
rate of increase in the wholesale price index declined to 37 percent in 1981
and 27 percent in 1982. In 1983 the downward trend was reversed and the
inflation rate rose to 30 percent. This rise was fueled by an expansion of
Central Bank credits to firms and commercial banks in difficulty during the
second half of 1983 as well as an unexpected increase in the budget deficit.
The resulting liquidity expansion, in conjunction with a lowering of nominal
deposit interest rates, encouraged consumption at the expense of savings.
10.      Inflation accelerated further in the first half of 1984, although it
moderated in the second half. The average inflation for 1984 is estimated at
a little over 50 percent. The major factors that contributed to the worsening
of the inflationary situation were the lagged impact of the expansionary
monetary policy pursued during the second half of 1983, and a significant
increase in agriculture product prices, especially of fresh fruits and
vegetables, as a consequence of export liberalization and higher export market
prices. Other important inflationary factors included substantial "catch up"
increases of SEE prices and higher import prices resulting from the nominal
depreciation of the Turkish lira. In addition, inflationary pressures stemmed
from a larger than anticipated budget deficit in 1984 as a result of a
slowdown in the growth of revenues.
11.      Commercial bank interest rates, which were deregulated in July 1980,
have increased substantially and are now positive in real terms. As a result,
total bank deposits increased by 72 percent in 1980 over 1979, and in 1981
this trend accelerated, with total deposits growing by 103 percent and time
deposits by 274 percent. Growth in total deposits slowed after 1982, and in
1983 and 1984 they grew at 53 percent and 42 percent respectively. The
bankruptcy in late June 1982 of a major non-bank financial institution shook
depositor confidence and was followed by a shift of funds into the larger
banks. The Government averted ar. immediate crisis in the banking sector and
undertook actions to reform and strengthen the financial sector as a whole. A
new banking law was enacted in June 1983 which covered many of the
recoumendations made in the Bank's report on the Financial Sector
(No. 4459-TU). These included measures to reduce the undercapitalization of
banks, place limits on the real assets and investments of banks, link the
establishment of branches to the level of a bank's equity, reduce the
interlocking between banks and corporations, introduce a deposit insurance
scheme, and increase the role of the Central Bank in the supervision of the
banking sector. A new law is currently before Parliament which will further
the banking reform process by introducing standardized accounting for banks
and improved procedures for handling non-performing loans. The Government
also took a major step towards reducing the cost of intermediation by reducing
the financial transactions tax from 15 percent to 3 percent. Separately, the
Government has reduced the level of withholding tax applicable to interest
payments on deposits and bonds from 20 percent to 10 percent. Other important
developments in the financial sector include measures undertaken to revitalize
the capital markets, for which IFC has provided technical assistance, and the
sale of revenue-sharing certificates linked to the income from selected public
facilities (e.g. the Bosphorus bridge).



12.      The Government is committed to maintaining an interest rate structure
for deposits which is positive in real terms. Time deposits have been
yielding more or less positive real returns since end-1983, with interest
rates ranging from 45 to 53 percent depending upon the term of the deposit.
While positive real interest rates have provided an incentive to save, they
have also meant high borrowing costs. Nominal interest rates range from 60 to
80 percent on non-preferential credits, in part because of the high
intermediation costs of the commercial banks and their widely prevalent
practice of requiring compensating balances. The interest rate differentials
between preferential and non-preferential credits and among preferential
credits are large and need to be reduced. The Government has reaffirmed its
determination to achieve positive real rates on all lending by a combination
of bringing down inflation and phasing out interest rate subsidies on
preferential credits. In January 1985, it eliminated preferential interest
rates on short-term export credits. High market interest rates, together with
the limited availability of credit, have led to considerable liquidity
problems for the private business sector, particularly for businesses
supplying the domestic market. Measures are also needed to lower the
operating costs of banks, which are well above prevailing levels in comparable
countries.
13.      In the fiscal area, progress was evident from 1980 to 1982 but there
have been slippages in 1983 and 1984. The budget deficit to GNP ratio was
reduced from 5.3 percent in 1980 to 2.1 percent in 1982, and the Public Sector
Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) dropped sharply from 12.6 percent of GNP to
6.9 percent over the same period. However, the revenue to GNP ratio has been
declining over the past three years. From a high of 20.3 percent in 1981, it
has fallen sharply to an estimated 15.6 percent in 1984. Largely because of
this significant shortfall in revenues, overall fiscal performance has
worsened since 1983 even though government expenditures have been considerably
curtailed (from 24.2 percent of GNP in 1980 to an estimated 20.8 percent in
1984) and budgetary transfers to SEEs as a percentage of GNP have fallen
steadily (from 4.8 percent in 1980 to an estimated 1.6 percent in 1984). The
budget deficit is estimated at 5.2 percent of GNP in 1984 and the PSBR at
8.8 percent. The downward trend in the Government revenue to GNP ratio
highlights the urgency of mobilizing additional public resources. As a step
in this direction, the Government introduced a Value Added Tax (VAT) in
January 1985.
14.      Improvements in the balance of payments were systematic through 1982
with the current account deficit decreasing from $3.3 billion (5.7 percent of
GNP) in 1980 to $1.2 billion (2.2 percent of GNP) in 1982. However, in 1983
the current account deficit widened to about $2.1 billion (4.2 percent of GNP)
as merchandise exports and workers' remittances fell short of targets.
Exports rebounded strongly in 1984, growing by 25 percent in dollar terms to
$7.1 billion.  Remittances, too, registered a higher than expected increase,
reaching $1.9 billion (up by 24 percent).  Concurrently, there was a continued
large inflow of deposits through the Dresdner scheme ($550 million in 1984).
Under this scheme the Dresdner Bank collects deposits from Turkish workers in
Germany and automatically places these funds at the disposition of the Central
Bank of Turkey, which guarantees the deposits and pays an interest rate
commensurate with the Euro-market rate. However, these increases were offset
by a sharp rise in merchandise imports to $10.8 billion (up by 16 percent in
dollar terms). As a result, the current account deficit in 1984 was
considerably higher than projected, reaching $2.1 billion (4.3 percent of
GNP), or about the same level as in 1983.



15.      On balance, merchandise export performance has been impressive over
the 1980-84 period, growing at an average anni''l rate of about 26 percent in
dollar terms. This growth has been led by t'he manufacturing sector and has
involved a rise in the share of exports to the Middle Eastern countries.
Industrial exports, comprised primarily of p.rocessed foods and textiles, have
risen from 36 percent of total exports in 19&' t3 72 percent in 1984. These
results were acuieved by a combination of indirect (flexible exchange rate
policy and import liberalization) and direct (tax rebates, preferential
credits) measures to enhance the relative profitability of exports and offset
the traditional bias towards producing for the domestic market. The flexible
exchange rate policy was one of the most important factors cortributing to the
growth of exports, together with the penetration of Turkish products in Middle
East markets.
16.      On the import side, the 1982-83 period was marked by a relative
stability in the growth of merchandise imports, mostly due to exogenous
factors. Imports fell by 1.0 percent in dollar terms in 1982 and rose by only
4.4 percent in 1983. This reflected price decreases in both oil and non-oil
imports. Merchandise imports, however, increased substantially in value in.
1984. The increase has been most significant in some of the groups (e.g. raw
materials and consumer goods) that have been subjected to major liberalization
in terms of both a lowering of tariff rates and a significant removal of
quantitative restrictions.
Medium-Term Prospects
17.      The Government's Fifth Five Year Plan (1985-89) was approved by the
Grand National Assembly in July 1984. The Plan reaffirms the Government's
determination to pursue an outward-oriented development strategy and to
liberalize the economy by relying increasingly on market forces for allocation
decisions. The public sector is targeted to play a supportive role by
concentrating its investments in infrastructure rather than manufacturing,
while the private sector is to be encouraged to play a leading role in the
growth of manufacturing and exports. Some of the key targets are:
(i) an average annual GNP growth rate of 6.3 percent;
(ii) an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise exports of
10.6 percent;
(iii) an average annual real rate of growth of merchandise imports of
8.2 percent;
(iv) an average annual real rate of growth of 10.9 percent in private
investment and 6.8 percent in public investment; and
(v) a declining external debt service ratio, from 26 percent in 1984
to around 18 percent in 1989.

18.         While  the overall thrust of the Plan is in accord with  the goals of
the structural adjustment program, certain targets seem optimistic in view of
both past performance end  the immediate prospects for the economy.   The Bank's
projections indicate the need for a continuation of the stabilisation program
well into 1987, implying a lower grovth rate in GDP for the early years of the
Plan and a return to a higher growth path only in 1988. Key economic
variables in the Bank's latest projections for the period 1985-89 are
presented in Table 1:

19.      Bank projections indicate a GDP growth of 5.6 percent per annum on
average for the Plan period, with a low of 4.9 percent in the initial year of
the Plan (stabilization period) and a high of 6.3 percent for the final year
(growth period). Achievement of these growth rates will depend on the
performance of the productive sectors, namely agriculture and manufacturing.
This in turn will depend to a large extent on the Government's determination
to constrain the growth of the public sector in line with public resources and
to create a more favorable investment climate for the private sector. This
translates itself into a projected real growth per annum in public fixed
investment of about 5.0 percent on average for the Plan period, starting with
a modest increase in the early years. The comparable figure for private fixed
investment is 10.6 percent or a little more than twice the growth rate for
public fixed investment. These figures are consistent with the need to meet
the infrastructure requirements of the economy through the public investment
program, while providing for the capacity expansion of the private sector
necessary to meet the export and growth targets.
20.      Merchandise exports are projected to grow at an average 9.4 percent
per annum in real terms. Merchandise imports, on the other hand, are
projected to grow more slowly in real terms through 1986 and then pick up to
an average 7.5 percent per annum in the terminal years of the Plan. On these
assumptions, the current account deficit is projected to decrease through 1986
as stabilization policies act to contain import growth while encouraging
exports. As higher growth rates set in during the middle of the Plan period,
the trend would reverse and the current account deficit would rise moderately
through the end of the Plan. The terminal year 1989 would show a deficit of
approximately $2.0 billion as compared to a 1985 figure of $1.7 billion. The
projected capital account is seen to remain manageable throughout the period
even in the face of some sharp increases in the amortization payments in
t985-87 arising from the debts rescheduled during the 1978-80 period and an
imposed constraint on foreign exchange reserves equivalent to at least two
months' imports. Consistent with the above is an average debt service ratio
for medium and long-term credits for the Plan period of 21.7 percent.
Including short-term debt the average debt service ratio for the Plan period
is 23.7 percent. Gross capital inflows required in 1989, on these
assumptions, would be about $5.9 billion, or about 38 percent higher than the
amount in 1984. Such an inflow is consistent with a decreasing debt service
ratio from 1986 onwards.
21.      The medium-term scenario presented above is, of course, only one of
many possibilities and is used specifically to illustrate Turkey's potential
in the light of the Government's own development strategy. Given Turkey's
progress in the structural adjustment program, the favorable response which
this has evoked from the international financial community and the present
view of future resources and export market possibilities, the Government's
somewhat more ambitious Plan targets would be feasible provided they are
supported by slightly higher export growth rates and greater success in the
mobilization of public resources. This may be more difficult to achieve in
the early (stabilization) phase of the Plan.
22.      In view of the sensitivity of the projections to the assumptions of
export and import growth rates, a downside risk case has also been developed.
With Turkey's export performance heavily dependent on exogenous factors such



as the world economic outlook and movements in international prices, a slower
growth of merchandise exports (an average of 6.9 percent over the Plan period)
would lead to a more difficult but still manageable balance of payments
situation, more external borrowing, a lower GDP growth (averaging about
4.8 percent per annum) and a higher debt service ratio (22-24 percent per
annum). In such a situation the Government would have little chance of
absorbing the unemployed and improving tangibly the average standard of
living. However, given the Government's emphasis on export promotion and the
determined efforts to counter the bias towards producing for the domestic
market, there is good reason to support the perspective set out in the
medium-term scenario presented in paragraphs 18 to 21.
External Debt and Creditworthiness
23.      At the end of 1978, Turkey had $7.2 billion in short-term debt and
$7.0 billion in medium and long-term debt. Between 1978 and 1980, Turkey
rescheduled some $9.2 billion of outstanding obligations through a series of
rescheduling arrangements concluded with official and commercial creditors.
Approximately $6.0 billion of short-term debt, including $2.6 billion in
convertible Turkish lira deposits and bankers' credits and $1.2 billion of
non-guaranteed suppliers' credits, were consolidated into medium-term loans or
partially converted into Turkish lira obligations. Following the resolution
of the debt crisis, inflows were mostly from official sou.rces -  major
creditors being the OECD countries, the World Bank and Lhe IMF. Of the
estimated total debt outstanding of $22.7 billion at end-1984, 81 percent
constituted medium and long-term debt (including IMF). Short-term debt as a
percentage of total debt outstanding fell from 51 percent in 1978 to about
11 percent in 1982, then increased to 14 percent in 1983 and to an estimated
18 percent in 1984. Much of this growth in the stock of short-term debt is
due to the inflows associated with the Dresdner Bank scheme (para. 14). At
end-1984 the outstanding liabilities associated with the Dresdner scheme are
estimated to amount to $1.8 billion, which would represent about 45 percent of
Turkey's short-term external obligations and 8 percent of its total
outstanding debt. Based on the growth scenArio outlined earlier, debt
outstanding and disbursed as a percentage of GDP is projected to fall from an
estimated 41 percent in 1984 to 32 percent in 1989. This translates into a
total debt outstanding forecast for 1989 of $30.6 billion, with short-term
debt constituting about 23 percent of that total. Dresdner scheme inflows are
projected to be around $600 million per annum throughout this period and to
account for a large part of the rise in the ratio of short-term debt to total
debt outstanding.
24.      The debt service ratio for medium and long-term credits (in relation
to exports of goods and non-factor services and workers' remittances)
increased from about 14.6 percent in 1981 to a peak of 28 percent in 1983 as a
result of a large repayment of previously rescheduled debt under the earlier
OECD agreements. Debt service obligations are likely to be high over the
coming years and would average about $3.8 billion per year in 1985-89.
However, the debt service ratio is seen to decrease from an estimated
25 percent in 1984 to 19.8 percent in 1989. The debt burden should remain
manageable provided current policies are successfully implemented, the export
drive is sustained, and Turkey continues to receive further support from
international commercial and official sources. There have been encouraging



- 9 -
signs of Turkey's ability to enter the market for commercial borrowings. From
December 1983 to November 1984, Turkey had secured a little over $500 million
from commercial credits, constituting about 23 percent of the total external
credits received during this period. The Central Bank of Turkey recently
completed the syndication of a $500 million multi-component medium-term
(seven years) facility involving a large number of U.S., European, Japanese
and Middle Eastern commercial banks as lead managers.
25.     Turkey's economic program has been supported by the IMF through a
series of standby arrangements. A three-year standby arrangement in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1250 million was approved by the IMF's Board and became
effective an June 18, 1980. The Government purchased the full amount
authorized under the arrangement. The Government also purchased
three-quarters of a SDR 225 million one-year standby arrangement which was
approved by the IMF in April 1984 and replaced an earlier one-year arrangement
terminated at the request of the Government.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN TURKEY
26.     Through March 31, 1985 the Bank and IDA have lent $5383.5 million 1/
to Turkey, through 81 projects. Agriculture accounts for 19 percent of funds
lent, industry and DFCs for 24 percent, power for 13 percent, structural
adjustment and program loans for 32 percent, and urban development,
transportation, education, tourism and technical assistance for the remaining
12 percent. Disbursements for all sectors combined (excluding structural
adjustment loans) average 49 percent of appraisal estimates, as compared to
51 percent for Tunisia and 48 percent for Morocco. As of March 31, 1985, IFC
commitments to Turkey totalled about $239 million, of which about $64 million
were still held by IFC. Annex II provides a summary statement of Bank loans,
IDA credits and IFC investments as of March 31, 1985.
27.     Bank lending is aimed at supporting Turkey's medium-term objectives
of restructuring the Turkish economy by placing more reliance on market forces
and adopting a more outward-oriented strategy. The main vehicle for the
Bank's operational discussions with the Government has been the structtural
adjustment lending (SAL) program. SAL V, which was approved in June 1984,
completed the series of five loans which the Bank had indicated would be the
maximum to a country. Significant progress has been achieved in the :ast
five years, but the task of restructuring is by no means over.  The   !t: phase
will involve the broadening and deepening of the adjustment process a- the
sectoral level. Recent economic developments have underlined the need for a
continuation of the stabilization program without giving up the goals of
1/ Net of cancellations.



- 10 -
sectoral adjustment. Hence the emphasis of Bank lending in the post-SAL
period would be on striking an appropriate balance between sectoral adjustment
lending designed to be quick disbursing and supportive of policy reforms in
the major sectors, and carefully formulated project lending focussing on high
priority projects principally in the agriculture, energy and transport sectors.
28.      Efforts have already been initiated to develop a series of sectoral
adjustment loans for the major sectors over the next few years, starting with
agriculture. The loans for the agriculture sector would help to support a
medium-term action program aimed at increasing the growth of primary
production and exports, rationalizing public investment and strengthening
sectoral institutions. Sectoral adjustment lending would also support
measures to address the structural problems of the financial sector and
enhance the utilization of industrial capacity in the public and private
sectors, keeping in view the scope for the "privatization" of publicly-held
assets in the manufacturing subsectors. Other sectors where sectoral
adjustment loans could be developed include energy and transport.
29.      Project lending, which will continue to make up the majority of the
lending operations, will be designed to support and strengthen the adjustment
process. A portion of project lending would be earmarked for the construction
or rehabilitation of key projects in the energy sector. Other projects would
be guided by the maior policy objectives of the Government, which include
generation of foreign exchange (including improving productivity in export
industries and providing essential infrastructure for exports), improvement of
institutional efficiency, non-inflationary output growth and amelioration of
the social costs of adjustment (including provision of social infrastructure
and employment generation, with some emphasis on the least developed provinces
in Eastern Turkey).
30.      The close macroeconomic and sector dialogue established with the
Government in recent years is expected to be pursued. The economic and sector
work currently being undertaken includes a review of the five-year development
plan and studies of housing finance, telecommunications and electronics.
Topics to be covered in the future include a review of the puDlic investment
program, a study focussing on the impact of structural adjustment, a review of
transport investments and studies of engineering and agro-industries.
31.      This would be the sixth loan to Turkey presented to the Executive
Directors this fiscal year. Other projects being processed include the
Kayraktepe and Sir Hydropower Projects.
32.      Turkey's debt burden is projected to remain manageable throughout
1985-89 (paras. 23 and 24). The Bank Group's share of Turkey's total external
debt was 12.4 percent in 1983, is estimated at 13 percent in 1984, and is
expected to grow to about 17 percent by 1989. Official debt outstanding is
projected to increase from $11.4 billion in 1984 to $14.4 billion in 1989 and
private medium and long-term debt outstanding is projected to increase from
$5.7 billion in 1984 to $8.8 billion in 1989. The Bank group's share of total
debt service payments is projected to increase from about 12 percent in 1983
tu an estimated 13 percent in 1984, and to about 17 percent in 1989.

33.      IFC has invested in synthetic yarns, textiles, pulp and paper, glass,
aluminum, cement, iron and steel products, heavy diesel engines, motor bicycle
engines, piston rings, food processing and tourism. It has also invested in
the Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and provided guarantees for
overseas contracting firms. In addition, IFC is currently providing technical
assistance to the Government with respect to the development of the capital
market and a regulatory framework for leasing.
PART III - THE ENERGY SECTOR AND THE POWER SUBSECTOR
Energy Resources
34.      Turkey has substantial untapped lignite and hydropower resources, as
well as more limited, but still important, oil, gas and coal resources and
geothermal potential. Hydropower with potential economic viability is
estimated at about 29,500 MW under average hydrological conditions and
corresponds to an annual production of about 100,000 GWh. Only 15 percent has
been developed so far, but this is projected to rise to about 30 percent by
1990. Proven recoverable reserves of oil are about 16 million tons; however,
potential reserves that may become economically recoverable, using enhanced
oil recovery techniques currently being tested, could be as high as 30 million
tons. Oil production has been declining over the last decade, as few
discoveries have been made in recent years; in 1983 production was about
17 million tons, equivalent to 45 percent of total consumption. Proven
recoverable gas reserves are about 400 billion standard cubic feet. Domestic
gas will, however, be supplemented, beginning in 1987, by large scale imports
of natural gas from the U.S.S.R.
35.      Total known reserves of hard coal are estimated at about 1 billion
tons, all located in the north of Turkey. Coal production has been declining
as operations move to deeper, less accessible seams; in 1983 production was
3.5 million tons (2.2 million toe). Proven and probable lignite reserves are
about 8 billion tons, but about half of this is of extremely low quality
(950-1,000 kcal/kg). Lignite production in 1983 was about 20 million tons,
equivalent to about 4.6 million tons of oil. There is potential for
geothermal development, for both space heating and electricity generation, and
a review of promising geothermal sites is under way.
Energy Consumption and Supply
36.      Total gross energy consumption was about 38 million toe in 1983, of
which commercial energy consumption amounted to 30 million toe. Petroleum
made up the most significant share of primary commercial energy (58 percent),
with lignite (20 percent), hydropower (9 percent), coal (11 percent),
asphaltite and imported electricity making up the balance. Overall, about
23 percent of final commercial energy consumption was in the form of
electricity. Non-commercial energy production (primarily fuelwood, but also
other biomass) was an important energy source, accounting for 37 percent of
total domestic energy production. The most notable change in the pattern of
energy consumption over the past two decades has been the decrease in the
relative share of hard coal in the total. This was accompanied by a rapid
growth in consumption of petroleum until the mid-1970s, peaking at over



- 12 -
50 percent in 19771/78; and a rapid rise in the share of lignite (primarily for
thermal power production) and hydroelectric power consumption starting in the
second half of the 1970s. During this period, hard coal consumption stayed
relatively constant in absolute terms, while traditional biomass energy
sources increased slightly in absolute terms but decreased steadily as a
percentage of total energy consumed.
37.      Trends observed in the growth and pattern of energy consumption
during the latter part of the 1970s are expected to continue during the 1980s
and 1990s. The most important factor in the growth of energy demand will be
the growth rate of the economy as a whole and the growth of the relatively
energy-intensive industrial sector. The demand for lignite is expected to
grow rapidly, both for direct consumption by households and industry and, even
more importantly, for the power sector. The growth in demand for petroleum
will be moderate due to the much higher price of imported oil and petroleum
products and its substitution by other energy sources.
Organization of the Energy Sector
38.      The energy sector :n Turkey is characterized by the dominance of
Government owned enterprises and agencies. The Ministry of Energy and Natural
Resources (MENR) is responsible for the development of energy resources in
Turkey. The Turkish Hard Coal Enterprise (TTK). the Turkish Lignite
Enterprise (TKI), the Turkish Petroleum Company (TPAO), and the Mineral
Research Institute (MTA) have responsibility for the extraction of fossil
.uels and radioactive minerals.  Identification, design and construction of
hydroelectric projects is entrusted to the State Hydraulics Authority (DSI).
The Turkish Electricity Authority (TEK) is responsible for the generation,
transmission and, since November 1982, the distribution of almost all the
electricity sold in Turkey.  TEK is also responsible for the implementation of
the Government's program for rural electrification and the construction of all
generating and transmission facilities, with the exception of hydroelectric
plants for which DSI has responsibility.
39.      Private sector participation in the supply of electricity was, until
1983, confined to two small private utilities (CEAS and KEPEZ) and industrial
companies which generated power for their own use. However, recent changes _-
Government energy policy now give greater encouragement to private sector
participation in the development and production of energy (para. 41). The
Government is actively seeking ways to encourage both local and foreign
private sector participation in geothermal development, lignite mining,
hydroelectric projects and the construction and operation of power plants
fired by imported fuels.
Energy Sector Policy
40.      To meet its energy requirements, Turkey launched a massive program in
the late 1970s to increase the domestic production of electricity and
lignite. This program tended to stretch the implementation capabilities of
the State energy agencies, and spread resources too thinly over too many
projects, with resulting long delays in completion schedules. This has, in
turn, resulted in an energy deficit which is likely to remain a feature of the
Turkish economy at least through the 1980s. MENR and TEK are in the process



- 13 -
of improving their energy planning capabilities; and MENR has produced
Turkey's first energy policy paper. Furthermore, the recent Five Year
Development Plan (1985-89) contains some broad objectives relevant to the
energy sector including the following:
-   Priority is to be given to domestic sources of energy, especially
hydra and lignite, provided that they are economically justified;
-   Imported energy including, but not limited to, oil will be
considered;
-   Renewable and nonconventional resources such as geothermal, solar
and biogas are to be supported; and
-   Private sector financing, both local and foreign, will be sought
for participation in energy development.
41.      Two features of Government policy appear to represent a departure
from previous energy policy. The first is that Government policy is now quite
clearly to encourage private sector participation in the energy sector. There
are now no legal constraints to private sector electricity generation, and
existing private utilities like KEPEZ and CEAS have plans to increase their
capacities. In addition, the State Planning Organization (SPO) is currently
undertaking, with assistance from consultants, preliminary studies to assess
whether private finance could be sought for the construction and operation of
thermal plants based upon imported fuels (coal, nuclear) and geothermal
sources. The second shift in policy focus is increased concern that
indigenous resources be developed only when economically justified. Improving
efficiency in the lignite mining subsector at least to levels at which
marginal production costs are competitive with imported coal, or conversely
abandoning such mining ventures if such economies cannot realistically be met,
will thus be a major energy policy concern for the Government.
42.      A less explicit but no less important component of the Government's
energy policy relates to the pricing of energy products. Regular increases in
the prices of petroleum products to maintain prices at economic levels has
been a feature of the Government's pricing policy for the past five years.
Electricity tariffs have been increased sharply since early 1984. As of
April 1, 1985 bulk power tariffs are roughly at the level of long run marginal
cost. Prices of petroleum products are being maintained at international
levels. Lignite prices, which had shown a threefold increase in real terms in
the seven years preceding 1983, declined slightly in in real terms in 1984.
43.      The Government is also in the process of developing a program for the
conservation of energy by encouraging more efficient use in existing and new
industrial enterprises. Energy efficiency programs and legislation have been
evaluated by both the MENR and SPO, and legislation has been passed which
allows for tax credits for various types of investments in energy efficiency
improvements. The Bank included financing of energy audits in selected
manufacturing facilities under Loan 1916-TU. These audits have been completed
and are under review. TEK has engaged consultants to assist in the
development of an energy conservation and load management program.

Electricity Supply and Demand
44.     The present installed power capacity in Turkey im about 7,600 MW of
which 3,500 MW (50 percent) is thermal and the balance hydro. The share of
hydroelectric power has increased over the past ten years from 33 percent in
1972 to about 50 per cent in 1984. On the thermal side, lignite has made an
increasing contribution to the production of electricity. Total gross
generation in 1984 was about 30,000 GWh. of which TEK accounted for almost
90 percent. Imported electricity from Bulgaria and the U.S.S.R. accounted for
a further 2,500 GWh. Total availability was less than the potential effective
demand. estimated at 35,000 GWh. There is considerable evidence that power
shortages have caused cutbacks in production in industries such as cement,
textiles and paper. In addition to the capacity constraint, the high level of
total system losses (technical losses plus energy unaccounted for), estimated
at about 20 percent, contributed to the supply shortages.
45.    Growth in demand for electricity averaged about 9 percent per annum
over the period 1965-1983. Between 1970 and 1983, the percentage of
population with public electricity supply rose from 51 percent to 78 percent.
Per capita consumption of electricity is currently about 550 kWh. TEK's
latest long-term generation plan (1987-2005) is based upon a projected overall
growth in energy demand of about 11 percent per annum, with peak demand
increasing at about 9 percent per annum. This represents a considerable
sustained annual increase in demand, particularly as the base from which the
demand is extrapolated (1987) appears to be high.
46.     For more than two decades the Turkish power subsector has been
confronted with major problems. Electricity supply has been insufficient to
meet demand in every year since 1971, resulting in high costs to the economy
as imports increased and supply interruptions continued. Many of the issues
facing the subsector can be traced to institutional problems in the public
sector agencies responsible for planning and implementing the subsector's
investment program. This has resulted in project delays, consequent
substantial cost escalations, power shortages, frequent and protracted plant
breakdowns due to inadequate maintenance, and relatively high system losses,
especially in the urban networks. The shortage of qualified staff in TEK
resulted in resources, human and financial, spread too thinly over too many
projects in the investment program.
47.     The Government agrees that closing the supply gap will require a major
coordinated effort by the major agencies in the subsector. It plans to
emphasize increased supply in parallel with managing demand and improving
efficiency of existing facilities. To illustrate the magnitude of the task,
it should be noted that Turkey would have to bring ou stream three times more
capacity in the 1980s than in the 1970s and that the momentum would have to be
sustained throughout most of the 1990s. Also, scarce resources will be tied
up in technologies new to the country, such as nuclear, and in projects of an
unprecedented size. TEI and DSI will have to meet their respective production
targets commensurate with TEK's plans. Even if a lower growth rate in
electricity demand is assumed, and optimistic assumptions are made about the
sector's implementation capacity, some power shortages are likely to continue
throughout the 1980s.

Bank's Role in the Power Subsector and Experience with Past Lending
48.     The proposed project would be the sixteenth Bank operation in the
power subsector in Turkey. The Bank has made eleven loans and a technical
assistance grant (total $639.7 million), and IDA has granted three credits
(total $55.7 million) for four hydroelectric projects, two thermal power
stations (oil- and lignite-fired), a lignite mine, and several transmission
and distribution networks. The technical assistance grant helped reorganize
Turkey's power subsector. The first five loans/credits were for projects in
the CEAS coacession area. All these projects were completed successfully,
although often with long delays. The Bank has made four previous loans to
TEK, for the First, Second and Third Power Tr.nsmission Projects, and for the
Elbistan Mine and Power Project.
49.     A Project Performance Audit Report (PPAR) distributed to the Board in
November 1981, 1/ on the Keban Transmission (Loan 568-TU) and the first TEK
Power Transmission (Loan 763-TU) projects, found that these projects had met
their physical objectives despite implementation delays and cost overruns. A
Project Completion Report on the Istanbul Power Distribution Project (Loan
892-TU), distributed to the Board in December 1982, 2/ also reported physical
completion of the project after considerable delay. Major constraints to
timely project completion were identified as shortage of local counterpart
finance and, in the case of Loan 892-TU, late preparation of bidding
documents. A major conclusion of the TEK II (Loan 1194-TU) Project Completion
Report was the need for improvement in the monitoring and coordination of the
project. The report recommended the establishment of a single unit within TEK
to be accountable for project implementation. Such units are now regularly
used in Bank financed power projects in Turkey. Implementation of the Third
TEK Transmission Project (Loan 2322-TU) is satisfactory.
50.     The Bank has been able to assist the Government in the consolidation
of the power sector and in the creation of TEK. The Bank has also supported
efforts to bring about other institutional reforms. Considerable progress has
been made in areas such as TEK's accounting system, system planning, and
procurement procedures. The Bank has also assisted in attracting funds from
other bilateral and international financing agencies (e.g. EIB, German Aid
(KfW), US EXIMBANK).
Planned Strategy for Assistance to the Subsector
51.     Sector policy discussions, which recently have been held twice a year
with the Government and energy sector agencies, have provided a useful forum
to discuss the issues and constraints facing the subsector. The Bank is
generally in agreement with the Government's strategy for the energy
subsector. Detailed agency by agency action programs have been prepared and
will be discussed with the Bank in 1985. Current and future Bank lending
would be based on these action programs. For the electric power subsector, it

2I No. 4264, dated December 29, 1982.



- 16 -
has been agreed that attention would be given to a selected number of high
priority issues. The strategy includes focus on (a) investments which yield
quick returns, such as completion of priority ongoing investments, upgrading
of existing facilities, reduction in losses and improvements in maintenance
procedures and efficiency; (b) programs to ensure a balanced electric power
development program with respect to adequate investment in generation,
transmission, distribution and general plant; (c) technical assistance to
strengthen capabilities in planning, financial management and manpower
development; (d) investment in new generation options such as those based upon
imported coal and natural gas; and (e) an increase the role of the private
sector in the production of electricity.
52.      The Government and the Bank have jointly identified a series of
investments which would address the above medium-term issues, in addition to
the two proposed operations. The Bank agrees with the size and structure of
Turkey's 1985 power sector investment program and with the investment strategy
proposed for subsequent years. Detailed future investment programs will be
reviewed with the Bank.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Project History
53.      The proposed project is part of a comprehensive transmission
development program designed to meet TEK's needs up to the early 1990s. The
project was identified in September, 1984 and appraised in February 1985.
Loan negotiations were held in Washington from April 30 to May 2, 1985. The
Turkish delegation was led by Mr. Tunc Bilget, Chief Financial and Economic
Counselor in the Turkish Embassy in Washington and included representatives of
the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, the Treasury and TEK. A report
entitled "Staff Appraisal Report of a Fourth TEK Transmission Project",
(No. 5571-TU) dated May 20, 1985 is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. The main features of the loan and project are given in
the Loan and Project Summary and in Annex III.
Project Setting and Objectives
54.      The proposed project conforms to the Government's strategy for
increasing domestic production of energy economically and improving the
balance between investments in generation and investments in transmission and
distribution facilities. Since the main indigenous energy resources (hydro
and lignite) are typically far removed from the main load centers, TEK has had
to pay special attention to the construction of a least cost, long-term
transmission grid at the 380-kV level. Implementation of this grid started in
1974 and the related long-term construction program is being updated regularly
to take account of growth and changes in TEK's load and generation
requirements. The latest update in January 1985 covers the requirements
through the early 1990s.

Project Description
55.      The proposed project would be a continuation of the ongoing Third
Transmission Project (Loan 2322-TU) and would constitute the fourtb phase of
development of the 380-kV transmission network, covering 1986-1990. It would
include the following components:
(i)   construction of about 800 km of 380-kV transmission lines to
interconnect the Altinkaya and Hamitabat power stations to TEK's
bulk supply system and provide two additional links for the
Karakaya power station;
(ii)   construction and/or extension of 380/154-kV transformer
substations with total installed capacity of about 2,100 MVA;
(iii)   supply, installation and commissioning of equipment for the
construction and extension of 154-kV substations with about 3,300
MVA of new installed capacity;
(iv)   construction of a tower testing station for towers for
transmission lines up to 380-kV, with possibility of extension to
the 800-kV range;
(v)   supply of specialized line stringing equipment and vehicles to be
used in the installation of transmission lines;
(vi)   training and supply of devices, such as computer
ha-rdware/software to strengthen TEK's capabilities in network
engineering, planning and in transmission lines and substation
design; and
(vii)   consulting services to assist TEK in the implementation of the
project.
56.      The project would also include a training component which aims at
continuing the improvements under way in TEK's capabilities in network
planning and in transmission lines and substation design. Training would be
provided for about 90 specialized and experienced personnel in various
departments.  TEK has agreed to submit a detailed staff training prograo to
the Bank not later than June 30, 1986 and to implement the agreed program in
accordance with a schedule satisfactory to the Bank. (Loan Agreement, Section
3.03). The continuing problems of maintenance of the transmission grid would
be addressed under the Power System Operations Assistance Project which is
being processed in parallel with the proposed project.
Project Implementation
57.      TEK would be responsible for execution of the project.  Preparation
of tender documents for procurement of goods is under way and would be
completed by March 30, 1986. Construction of the transmission lines and
substations is scheduled to start in mid-1986 and to be completed by June 30,
1990. The engagement of project management consultants to assist TEK in the
implementation of the Project under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank would be a condition of loan effectiveness (Loan Agreement,
Section 7.01).



- 18 -
58.      Acquisition of rights-of-way for the lines is under way, and the
implementation schedule has been estimated on the basis of TEK's experience
with the Third Transmission Project. Land acquisition for the new 380-kV and
154-kV substations has not started yet. Therefore, to avoid delays on account
of land acquisition, an action plan has been agreed which provides for land
acquisition by TEK to be completed by September 30, 1986. The plan also
provides for acquiring land for at least 10 substations by March 31, 1986, and
for 50 percent of the total sites by June 30, 1986 (Loan Agreement, Section
3.05).
Environmental Impact
59.      The project would not have major adverse effects on the environment.
Aesthetic effects and, to a lesser extent, noise would be the principal
adverse effects and both would be kept at acceptable levels.
Project Cost and Financing
60.      The total cost of the proposed project, including physical and price
ccvntingencies but excluding the interest during construction, would be about
$195 million, of which $146 million would be in foreign exchange. The project
cost estimates are based on January 1985 prices derived from quotations
received recently by the Borrower for equipment and material similar to those
included in the project. Total physical contingencies have been kept at about
10 percent of base cost, taking into account the advanced state of the design
for the lines and the repetitive and routine nature of the work for the
substations. Price contingencies have been computed assuming an
implementation period consistent with Bank experience and projected annual
increases in domestic and international prices.
61.      The proposed Bank loan of $142 million would finance 89 percent of
the foreign cost including $13 million to finance interest during
construction. TEK's current tight cash flow situation, caused inter alia by
its heavy investment program would ,ustify finance of interest during
construction. The remaining $66 million of the total cost would be covered by
TEK's internal cash generation, materials from stock, and Government
contributions. The balance of $17.0 million of foreign exchange costs to be
borne by the Government and TEK would cover the cost of materials and
equipment to be supplied by TEK from inventory and the indirect foreign
exchange cost for installation and erection which would be undertaken by TEK
or local contractors.
62.      TEK is currently exempt from import taxes and customs duties for the
projects under construction. Therefore, taxes and import duties are not
included in the project cost. The Government has confirmed that this
exemption would extend to the proposed project.
Financial Position of TEK
63.      TEK's financial position improved markedly over the last year.  TEK
had suffered a net operating loss in 1983, due to a combination of poor
hydrological conditions, high costs and insufficient tariff increases. The
situation improved sharply in 1984, due to a substantial upward adjustment in



- 19 -
tariff levels and sharply improved hydrological conditions. In 1984 the
combined investments of TEK and DSI amounted to TL522 billion ($1.5 billion
equivalent). The principal sources of financing for the two entities combined
were estimated as follows: internal cash generation (16 percent); Government
equity (41 percent); foreign borrowing (42 percent); and local borrowing
(1 percent).
64.      The approved subsector investment program for 1985 is TL600 billion
($1.13 billion equivalent), including TL400 billion for TEK and TL200 billion
for DSI. While this is below the investment level required for the sector, it
is more in line with existing implementation and financing capacity. The
Government proposes to finance the program as follows:  Government equity
(21 percent); foreign borrowing (41 percent); local borrowing (2 percent); and
internal cash generation (36 percent) 1/. TEK would contribute at least
32 percent in 1985 and 35 percent thereafter of the cost of TEK's and DSI's
electrical power investment program (Loan Agreement, Section 5.03). It has
been agreed that TEK and DSI's draft annual investment programs and budgets
for the next five years, and related financing planning, would be discussed by
the Government with the Bank by October 31 of each year. (Guarantee
Agreement, Section 3.01 and Loan Agreement, Section 3.04).
65.      Bulk electricity tariffs increased by about 40 percent in real terms
in 1984, which more than made up for real decreases in the previous two
years. Following further real increases in bulk power tariffs in 1985, as of
April 1, 1985 they were roughly equivalent to long run marginal cost. Retail
tariffs have also been increased in parallel since 1983. TEK confirmed that
increases in bulk power tariffs would continue to be passed through to the
retail level and that tariffs would continue to be adjusted automatically for
increases in TEK's fuel costs (Loan Agreement, Section 5.04).
66.      Given TEK's new authority to collect sales revenues directly from
retail customers instead of the municipalities, the deterioration in TEK's
working capital situation through 1982 should normally have been reversed in
1983. However, because of the significant real decrease in tariffs in 1983,
serious cash flow problems continued in 1983. TEK's accounts receivable at
the end of 1983 were equivalent to 267 days of sales revenue. Deferring
payments to its fuel suppliers in 1983, TEK used its available funds for
capital expenditures, rather than operating expenses, in order to avoid delays
in the implementation of its investment program. This, combined with past
accumulated arrears, increased TEK's accounts payable to TL283 billion by the
end of 1983, exceeding one year's gross operating revenues.  To stop rising
indebtedness among public enterprises, the Government in 1984 converted
TL230 billion in TEK's net overdue accounts payable to eqtuity. The Government
does not expect to repeat the role of a financial clearing house for debts
between public enterprises. Since mid-1984, TEK has been paying its fuel
1/       This number understates TEK's actual cash contribution, as it does
not include the net Value Added Tax (10 percent) and the radio and
television tax (3.5 percent) which are collected by TEK and passed on
to the Treasury.

suppliers on schedule. The current ratio improved from a level of about 0.8
in 1983 to an estimated level of 1.2 in 1984. It has been agreed that in
future TEK would maintain a current ratio of at least 1.0. (Loan Agreement,
Section 5.02). It has also been agreed that TEK would implement a Financial
Action Plan, covering a reduction of accounts receivables (excluding arrears
from municipalities) to the equivalent of 90 days of sales by the end of 1988,
improvement of foreign debt service management improvement of financial
planning and engagement of consultants to assist with improvements in cost
accounting (Loan Agreement, Schedule 5).
Audits
67.      TEK's financial statements are audited by the High Control Board in
the Prime Ministry. TEK is required by law to submit its balance sheets and
final accounts to the Prime Ministry for auditing no later than the third
month following the year they pertain to. TEK is then required to submit its
annual audited accounts to the Bank no later than five months after the close
of the year. However, there are shortcomings in both the scope and the timing
of the present audit reports. The auditors rarely comment on the reliability
of the presentation of the accounts, or on significant events which occurred
during the year. The audit reports concerning 1981 and 1982 were received
more than a year after the close of the fiscal year. Similarly, the audit
report for 1983 had not yet been received as of April 1985. Most likely it
will not be possible to meet the five month target for submission of audit
reports until the 1987 report. TEK's consultants are giving priority to
helping TEK improve the timeliness and accuracy of the financial statements.
Furthermore, an upgrading of TEK's computer center, presently being studied,
should improve TEK's ability to prepare and correct the annual financial
reports. It is expected that the quality and timely submission of audit
reports will improve gradually. The 1985 and 1986 reports are expected within
ten and eight months, respectively, after the end of the given fiscal year,
and within five months for 1987 and afterwards.
Procurement and Disbursements
68.      The goods and services to be procured for the proposed project have
been grouped into 10 contracts for the transmission lines and 11 contracts for
the substations to ensure effective international competition. Proposed
contract packages with IBRD financing for the transmission lines are:

All items financed by the Bank would be procured in accordance with the Bank's
procurement guidelines. Items (a) through (h) for the transmission lines and
(a) through (i) for the substations would be procured through international
competitive bidding (ICB). For procurement through ICB, local firms would be
allowed a margin of preference equal to the existing rate of customs duties
applicable to nonexempt importers or 15 percent of the c.i.f. price of such
goods, whichever is lower. Sixty man-months of consulting services for both
components would be procured in accordance with the provisions of the Bank's
Guidelines for Use of Consultants. Training manuals and other miscellaneous
training aids and computer software/hardware packages would be purchased
through limited international shopping for items of less than $10,000 up to an
aggregate limit of $300,000; for such contracts the Borrower would obtain
written price quotations from at least three reputable suppliers. To complete
the project, TEK would provide the following goods and services which would
not he financed by the Bank: (i) towers (material and fabrication) for three
lines:  Karakaya-Osmaniye, Altinkaya-Carsamba and Hamitabat-Alibeykoy and all
the remaining equipment for the substations (line traps, panels, steel
structures, etc.); and (ii) line stringing, and civil works and installation
and erection of the substations which would be carried out by TEK's force
account or local contractors. All the contracts for works, and equipment and
materials to be financed by the Bank and costing over $250,000 each would be
subject to prior Bank review. Other Bank-financed contracts would be subject
to post-award review. The proposed procurement plans are susmmarized in the

69.      Disbursements from the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan would be
made for:
(i)   100 percent of the foreign expenditures of directly imported
equipment and materials or 100 percent of local ex-factory prices
of equipment and materials manufactured in Turkey;
(ii)   20 percent of total expenditures for erection of steel towers;
(iii)   100 percent of foreign expenditures for overseas training and
training experts engaged under the project; and
(iv)   100 percent of the foreign expenditures of foreign consultants
and 85 percent of total expenditures for local consulting
services.

70.     It has been agreed that a special account would be established for
the project to finance expenditures with a minimum of administrative delay.
The initial deposit would be $8 million (Loan Agreement, Schedule 6).
Proiect Justification
71.     The proposed project is the least-cost means of interconnecting new
generation plants and is part of TEK's long-term transmission expansion plan.
The evaluation of transmission expansion alternatives is updated regularly to
reflect experience with the initial network of lines, as well as changes in
the development of TEK's interconnected system. The latest technical and
economic evaluation in January 1985, which was discussed with the Bank,
confirmed that the lines included in the project would be the least-cost means
of extending the 380-kV network to interconnect new plants coming on line.
72.     Since the project would form an integral part of TEK/DSI's 1985-1990
expansion program, the economic rate of return was calculated for TEK's
investment program for 1985-90, the construction period of the proposed
project. Measurable benefits were limited to the incremental revenue
attributable to the program, computed on the basis of: (a) TEK's projected
sales to industrial customers supplied directly at the high-voltage level and
to low-voltage consumers supplied through TEK's distribution enterprises;
(b) projected tariffs at the high- and low-voltage levels; and any net fuel
savings resulting from investment in improved efficiency in the thermal
plants. Tariff adjustments were projected in line with the financial
projections. On this basis the return on the program is estimated at
11.2 percent.
Project Risks
73.     Most of the 380 kV lines are in mountainous areas difficult to
reach. However, adequate construction technology is available to cope with
the expected terrain and climatic conditions.
74.     An action plan for the acquisition of land for the new 380 kV and
154 kV substations has been agreed (para.58). The proposed use of consultants
to assist TEK in project implementation would provide improve coordination
with construction of lines, substations and power plants affecting the project
and would assist TEK in preventing delays in project implementation.
75.     There is some possibility of a shortfall in available funds to meet
overall investment requirements for the medium-term. However, even at the
suggested lowest range of investment, the components which would be served by
the proposed project represent a set of core high priority investments which
are expected to remain unaffected.

PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMIENTS AND AUTHORITY
76.      The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and the Turkish Electricity
Authority, the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Turkey and
the Bank and the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement are being distributed to the
Executive Directors separately. Features of special interest are listed in
Annex III of this report. Engagement of consultants to assist TEK with
project implementation would be a special condition of effectiveness (Loan
Agreement, Section 7.01).
77.      r am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
78.      I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
