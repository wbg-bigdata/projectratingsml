                        LEVEL II RESTRUCTURING PAPER

A. SUMMARY

1.      In letters dated July 9, 2012 and August 17, 2012, the Ministry of Economy and
Finance requested the World Bank to proceed with the restructuring of Loan 7439 PA.
This loan finances the Panama Rural Productivity Project (P064918), and co-finances the
GEF Grant TF56628 for the Panama Rural Productivity and Consolidation of the Atlantic
Mesoamerican Biological Corridor Project (P083045). This Level Two restructuring of
the IBRD Loan would provide for (i) the reformulation of two of the Project’s
Development Objective (PDO) indicators to better reflect and quantify the targets of the
Project; (ii) a first 18-month extension of the Closing Date from January 31, 2013 to July
31, 2014; and (iii) a reallocation of Loan proceeds.

2.       The proposed changes would allow the Project to: (i) fully reach its Development
Objective of “contributing to increased productivity among organized rural small-scale
producers, through their participation in productive alliances, while ensuring the
sustainable use of natural resources and the conservation of globally important
biodiversity?; (ii) use and disburse all the loan funds; (iii) provide the necessary funding
to all the rural productive alliances that have been working with the project on preparing
investment plans and are waiting for funds for their sub-projects; and, (iv) strengthen the
post-funding support services to the beneficiaries, which would complement the sub-
projects investments. In addition, the reallocation of funds would allow the strengthening
of the monitoring and evaluation activities and project management and enhance the
sustainability of the investments.

3.      The reformulation of two of the PDO Indicators will also lead to the improvement
of the reporting on the impact by the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), especially in the
areas of sustainability and environmental impact.

B. PROJECT STATUS

4.       The Project has two implementing agencies: (i) the Ministry of Agricultural
Development (MIDA) for Component 1 (Support for Productive Alliances), Component
2 (Productive Alliances), and Component 4 (Project Management and Monitoring and
Evaluation), in the amount of US$29.4 million, out of the US$39.4 million loan, and
(ii) the National Environmental Authority (ANAM) for Component 3 (Environmental
Subprojects and Strengthening of the National Protected Areas System) for the remaining
US$10 million. Each agency has its own Project Implementation Unit and its own Results
Framework.

5.    MIDA-related activities. The Loan was approved on March 21, 2007 and
became effective on November 1, 2007. Progress towards the achievement of the PDO
and Implementation Progress are both Moderately Satisfactory, and all project flags have

                                             4
been removed in the past 12 months. In 2010, after a period of weak implementation in
the first two years of the Project execution, due to institutional instability and to a
consequent lack of national financing, the Project has picked up pace significantly. In
2011, the Project disbursed its allocated budget for 2011 of about US$3 million, and in
the first four months of 2012 it disbursed almost US$2 million. As of October 22, 2012,
58% of MIDA-related funds have been disbursed. Following the promising results of
2010 and in 2011, the Ministry of Finance (MEF) increased the budget allocation to the
project and fully funded the 2012 request from the Ministry of Agriculture, leading the
Project activities to resume at full pace. The current draft of the national budget for 2013
also includes the full requested allocation which would allow all remaining funds to be
disbursed by the proposed new Closing Date of the Loan.

6.      The PIU has completed the agreed action plan to enhance the performance and
impact of the project: it has conducted a review of the existing portfolio of
projects/investments, eliminating and restructuring sub-projects that were not
satisfactory, and selecting a current portfolio of sub-projects that are expected to use all
the remaining loan funds efficiently and productively. The PIU has also strengthened its
Monitoring and Evaluation staff and system, and in 2012, for the first time since
effectiveness, has been able to report on three out of the four PDO indicators, which
further indicate that the project's objectives remain reachable. The PIU has improved
significantly its compliance with the Bank's Safeguards and has appropriately
strengthened its focus on fiduciary and compliance issues as well. An audit firm has been
hired to conduct a review of the fiduciary activities of the MIDA sub-projects to ensure
compliance with Project requirements.

7.      As of mid-2012, the MIDA-related activities have completed the following: 121
alliances working with 4,400 producers and representing close to US$20 million of grants
were at various levels of preparation, including 59 sub-projects under implementation
(representing matching grants totaling US$11 million) and another 10 sub-projects about
to receive their initial grant (totaling about US$1.6 million). The final approval of the
remaining sub-projects will take place shortly after the extension of the closing date to
allow sufficient time for implementation.

8.      ANAM-related activities. The loan provides US$10.0 million of co-financing
to a US$6.0 million GEF Grant TF56628 to ANAM. The Grant was approved by the
Board on June 15, 2006, and became effective on January 2007, 10 months before the
loan effectiveness date. Progress towards the achievement of the Grant PDO is
Moderately Satisfactory. However, implementation progress is rated Moderately
Unsatisfactory, in line with the ratings given to Financial Management, Procurement, and
Safeguards compliance. The implementation of this component suffered severe delays in
the first two years of the project. Since June 2011, Project performance has shown
substantial progress, with all activities of the action plan established during the Mid-Term
Review carried out. The action plan included (i) the hiring of the vacant positions in the
PIU, (i.e. procurement, social and environmental specialists, accountant, and subprojects
coordinator), (ii) the update of the accounting register (needed because of the lack of an
accountant since December 2010), (iii) a new Annual Operating Plan, (iv) the resumption
of disbursements to sub-projects that had been put on hold because of the change of
management in ANAM and (v) the submission of overdue audit report and IFRs.
                                             5
Disbursements accelerated considerably to reach US$7.0 million (or 70%) of the IBRD
Loan and US$5.5 million (or 90.96%) of the Grant amount.

9.      As of mid-2012, the ANAM-related activities have completed the following: (a)
36,126 ha of forests and other natural ecosystems of global biodiversity significance in
buffer zones of Protected Areas under effective conservation, reaching 72% of the target;
(b) 308 environmental investments or subprojects under execution in 6 departments, 26
municipalities and 2 Comarcas that represent 88% of the target; (c) technical assistance
provided to help communities better commercialize their products; (d) 8 co-management
agreements in Protected Areas negotiated and established (vs. a target of 12); (e) local
environmental educational programs strengthened; (f) ongoing specific studies for the
establishment of a payment for environmental services (PES) mechanism; (g) a
monitoring system for biodiversity implemented, and (h) communication strategy
implemented.

C. PROPOSED CHANGES


           Project Outcome Indicators

10.     During the Mid-Term Review, the Bank Team and MIDA agreed that two of the
four PDO indicators would need to be reformulated because they were either too vague in
their definition or impossible to measure. As requested by the Government, two new
measurable indicators are being proposed which aim to keep the spirit of the two original
indicators.

        Reallocation of Loan Proceeds

11.     The reallocation among categories will allow MIDA and ANAM to strengthen the
monitoring and evaluation of project activities, particularly the implementation of the
productive and environmental subprojects. It will also finance the PIU-related costs
associated with the extension of the Closing Date financed under Category 4 and 5
below. Most of the category increases are financed out of unallocated funds and, to a
lesser extent, savings incurred during the first years of implementation.

12.     The Loan proceeds will be reallocated as follows:

        Closing date

13.     The Project suffered considerable implementation delays and high staff turnover
(including 5 PIU directors) during the first few years of operation, leading to the
Government to decrease the annual budget allocation for the project in the third and
fourth year. Since then, as mentioned above, considerable progress has been made in
terms of disbursement, general implementation, supervision of safeguards and financing
by the Government.



                                                  7
14.     An extension of 18 months from January 31, 2013 to July 31, 2014 is necessary to
allow the Borrower to conclude successfully the implementation and the monitoring and
evaluation of the subprojects. Since this is the Project’s first extension and is of 18
months, it will need to be approved by the Country Director. Based on (i) the Project’s
considerable progress in the last 12-18 months, (ii) the removal of the Project’s main
bottlenecks (e.g., full funding allocation from the national budget), (iii) a full pipeline of
eligible sub-projects whose financing would absorb all remaining funds and (iv) the PIUs
recent track record in respecting the Project’s implementation schedule (sub-project
approval, implementation and monitoring), the extension is expected to allow the project
to reach its PDO. The extension would also allow all the sub-projects of producers that
have been working with the Ministry of Agriculture to be funded as promised by the
Government. All eligible activities to be financed have been agreed previously with the
Bank, and will be included in the corresponding Annual Operating Plans for both MIDA
and ANAM. Both agencies are in full compliance with the Bank’s financial management
requirements, and there are no overdue audit reports and IFRs. With the extension of the
Closing Date, the amendment will also postpone the delivery of the Project report to be
prepared by the Client, established under Section IV.B.2 of Schedule 2, from the original
to the new Closing Date.
