                                 SCHEDULE 4
                    Procurement and Consultants' Services
Section I.  Procurement of Goods and Works
Part A:     International Competitive Bidding
1.    Except as provided in Part C hereof, goods and works shall
be procured under contracts awarded in accordance with
procedures consistent with those set forth in Sections I and II
of the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits" published by the Bank in May 1992 (the Guidelines) in
accordance with the following additional procedures:
      (a)   When contract award is delayed beyond the original bid
validity period, such period may be extended once, subject to
and in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2.59 of the
Guidelines, by the minimum amount of time required to complete
the evaluation, obtain necessary approvals and clearances and
award the contract. The bid validity period may be extended a
second time only if the bidding documents or the request for
extension shall provide for appropriate adjustment of the bid
price to reflect changes in the cost of inputs for the contract
over the period of extension. Such an increase in the bid price
shall not be taken into account in the bid evaluation. With
respect to each contract made subject to the Bank's prior review
in accordance with the provisions of Part D.1 (a) of this
Section, the Bank's prior approval will be required for (i) a
first extension of the bid validity period if the period of
extension exceeds sixty (60) days and (ii) any subsequent
extension of the bid validity period.
      (b)   For fixed-price contracts, the invitation to bid
referred to in paragraph 2.13 of the Guidelines shall provide
that, when contract award is delayed beyond the original bid
validity period, the successful bidder's bid price will be
increased for each week of delay by two predisclosed correction
factors acceptable to the Bank, one to be applied to all foreign
currency components and the other to the local currency
component of the bid price. Such an increase shall not be taken
into account in the bid evaluation.
      (c)   In the procurement of goods and works in accordance
with this Part A, the Borrower shall use the relevant standard
bidding documents issued by the Bank, with such modifications
thereto as the Bank shall have agreed to be necessary for the
purposes of the Project. Where no relevant standard bidding
documents have been issued by the Bank, the Borrower shall use
bidding documents based on other internationally recognized
standard forms agreed with the Bank.
Part B:     Preference for Domestic Manufacturers
      In the procurement of goods in accordance with the
procedures described in Part A.1 hereof, goods manufactured in
the Republic of Lithuania may be granted a margin of preference
Page  11
in accordance with, and subject to, the provisions of paragraphs
2.55 and 2.56 of the Guidelines and paragraphs 1 through 4 of
Appendix 2 thereto.
Part C:     Other Procurement Procedures
      Goods and works estimated to cost per contract the
equivalent of less than $1,000,000 shall be procured at
competitive prices in accordance with normal commercial
practices of respective Beneficiaries, acceptable to the Bank,
due account being taken also of other relevant factors such as
time of delivery and efficiency and reliability thereof and
availability of maintenance and spare parts therefor.
Part D:     Review by the Bank of Procurement Decisions
1.    Review of invitations to bid and of proposed awards and
final contracts:
      (a)   With respect to: (i) the first contract for goods or
works to be financed by each Participating Financial
Intermediary; and (ii) each contract for goods or works to be
awarded in accordance with the provisions of Section I, Part A.1
of this Schedule, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 2 and
4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where payments
for such contract are to be made out of the Special Account A or
the Special Account B, such procedures shall be modified to
ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract required to
be furnished to the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 2 (d) shall
be furnished to the Bank prior to the making of the first
payment out of the Special Account A in respect of such
contract.
      (b)   With respect to each contract not governed by the
preceding paragraph, the procedures set forth in paragraphs 3
and 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines shall apply. Where
payments for such contract are to be made out of the Special
Account A or the Special Account B, said procedures shall be
modified to ensure that the two conformed copies of the contract
together with the other information required to be furnished to
the Bank pursuant to said paragraph 3 shall be furnished to the
Bank as part of the evidence to be furnished pursuant to
paragraph 4 of Schedule 6 to this Agreement.
      (c)   The provisions of the preceding subparagraph (b) shall
not apply to contracts on account of which withdrawals are to be
made on the basis of statements of expenditure.
2.    The figure of 15% is hereby specified for purposes of
paragraph 4 of Appendix 1 to the Guidelines.
Section II.  Employment of Consultants
1.    In order to assist in the implementation of the Project,
consultants shall be employed whose qualifications, experience
and terms and conditions of employment shall be satisfactory to
the Bank. Such consultants shall be selected in accordance with
principles and procedures satisfactory to the Bank on the basis
of the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank
Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency" published
by the Bank in August 1981 (the Consultant Guidelines). For
complex, time-based assignments, such consultants shall be
employed under contracts using the standard form of contract for
consultants' services issued by the Bank, with such
modifications as shall have been agreed by the Bank. Where no
relevant standard contract documents have been issued by the
Bank, other standard forms agreed with the Bank shall be used.
2.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of this
Section, the provisions of the Consultant Guidelines requiring
prior Bank review or approval of budgets, short lists, selection
procedures, letters of invitation, proposals, evaluation reports
Page  12
and contracts shall not apply to (a) contracts for the
employment of consulting firms estimated to cost less than
$100,000 equivalent each or (b) contracts for the employment of
individuals estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent each.
However, this exception to prior Bank review shall not apply to
(a) the terms of reference for such contracts, (b) single-source
selection of consulting firms, (c) the first two contracts for
services under Part B.1 of the Project, (d) to assignments of a
critical nature as reasonably determined by the Bank, (e) to
amendments of contracts for employment of consulting firms
raising the contract value to $100,000 equivalent or above, or
(f) amendments to contracts for the employment of individual
consultants raising the contract value to $50,000 equivalent or
above.
                                 SCHEDULE 5

3.    After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to it
that a Special Account A has been duly opened, withdrawals of
the Authorized Allocation and subsequent withdrawals to
replenish such Special Account A shall be made as follows:

deposit or refund, as the case may be.

amount outstanding in the Special Account A will not be required
to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to
the Bank such outstanding amount.

unwithdrawn amount of the Loan Tranche allocated to the eligible
Categories shall follow such procedures as the Bank shall
specify by notice to the Borrower. Such further withdrawals
shall be made only after and to the extent that the Bank shall
have been satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit
in such Special Account B as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.    (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
payment out of the Special Account B: (i) was made for an
expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant to paragraph
2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not justified by the evidence
furnished to the Bank, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank: (A) provide such additional evidence as the Bank
may request; or (B) deposit into the Special Account B (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal
to the amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise agree, no
further deposit by the Bank into the Special Account B shall be
made until the Borrower has provided such evidence or made such
deposit or refund, as the case may be.
      (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time that any
amount outstanding in the Special Account B will not be required
to cover further payments for eligible expenditures, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank, refund to
the Bank such outstanding amount.
      (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank, refund to
the Bank all or any portion of the funds on deposit in the
Special Account B.
      (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs 6 (a),
(b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to the Loan
Account for subsequent withdrawal or for cancellation in
accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement,
including the General Conditions.
                                 SCHEDULE 8
                   Modifications of the General Conditions
      For the purposes of this Agreement, the provisions of the
General Conditions are modified as follows:
      The words "the Bank may, by notice to the Borrower or the
Guarantor terminate the right of the Borrower to make
withdrawals with respect to such amount. Upon the giving of such
notice, such amount of the Loan shall be cancelled" set forth at
the end of Section 6.03 are deleted and the following is
substituted therefor:
            "or (f) by the date specified in Section II.4(c) of
      the Annex to Schedule 5 to the Loan Agreement, the Bank
      shall, in respect of any portion of the Loan: (i) have
      received no applications or requests permitted under
      subparagraphs (a) or (b) of said paragraph; or (ii) have
      denied any such applications or requests, the Bank may, by
      notice to the Borrower, terminate the right to submit such
      applications or approvals or to make withdrawals from the
      Loan Account, as the case may be, with respect to such
      amount or portion of the Loan. Upon the giving of such
      notice, such amount or portion of the Loan shall be
      cancelled."
                                 SCHEDULE 9
                     Single Currency LIBOR Determination
1.    Single Currency LIBOR for any Single Currency for any
Page  22
Interest Period shall be the offered rate for deposits in the
Single Currency for a period of six months which appears on the
display designated as page "3750" on the Telerate monitor (or
such other page or service as may replace it for the purpose of
displaying London interbank offered rates of major banks for
Single Currency deposits), as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the
second day on which banks and foreign exchange markets are open
for business in London prior to the relevant January 15 or July
15 (the Interest Determination Date).
2.    If such rate does not appear on the Telerate monitor or on
such service as may replace it, the Bank shall request the
London offices of four major banks to provide the Bank with the
rate at which deposits in the Single Currency are offered by
such banks on the Interest Determination Date to leading banks
in the London interbank market for a period of six months ending
on the last day of such Interest Period. Single Currency LIBOR
for such Interest Period shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded
upwards if necessary to the fifth decimal place) of such offered
quotations as determined by the Bank.
3.    If not more than one major bank provides the Bank with such
quotations under paragraph 2 above, Single Currency LIBOR shall
be the arithmetic mean (rounded upwards if necessary to the
fifth decimal place) determined by the Bank of the rates quoted
by at least two major banks in New York City for U.S. Dollars
and Frankfurt for Deutsche Marks, as the case may be selected by
the Bank on the Interest Determination Date for loans in the
Single Currency to leading European banks for a period of six
months ending on the last day of such Interest Period. If fewer
than two of the banks so selected are quoting such rates, Single
Currency LIBOR shall be the Single Currency LIBOR in effect for
the last preceding Interest Period.
