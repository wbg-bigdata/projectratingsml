      IEG Mission: Improving World Bank Group development results through excellence in evaluation.


About this Report
       The Independent Evaluation Group assesses the programs and activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
first, to ensure the integrity of the Bank’s self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank’s work is producing the
expected results, and second, to help develop improved directions, policies, and procedures through the
dissemination of lessons drawn from experience. As part of this work, IEG annually assesses 20-25 percent of the
Bank’s lending operations through field work. In selecting operations for assessment, preference is given to those that
are innovative, large, or complex; those that are relevant to upcoming studies or country evaluations; those for which
Executive Directors or Bank management have requested assessments; and those that are likely to generate
important lessons.
      To prepare a Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR), IEG staff examine project files and other
documents, visit the borrowing country to discuss the operation with the government, and other in-country
stakeholders, and interview Bank staff and other donor agency staff both at headquarters and in local offices as
appropriate.
      Each PPAR is subject to internal IEG peer review, Panel review, and management approval. Once cleared
internally, the PPAR is commented on by the responsible Bank department. The PPAR is also sent to the borrower
for review. IEG incorporates both Bank and borrower comments as appropriate, and the borrowers' comments are
attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of Executive Directors. After an assessment report has
been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


About the IEG Rating System for Public Sector Evaluations
     IEG’s use of multiple evaluation methods offers both rigor and a necessary level of flexibility to adapt to
lending instrument, project design, or sectoral approach. IEG evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive
at their project ratings. Following is the definition and rating scale used for each evaluation criterion (additional
information is available on the IEG website: http://worldbank.org/ieg).
     Outcome: The extent to which the operation’s major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to
be achieved, efficiently. The rating has three dimensions: relevance, efficacy, and efficiency. Relevance includes
relevance of objectives and relevance of design. Relevance of objectives is the extent to which the project’s
objectives are consistent with the country’s current development priorities and with current Bank country and
sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals (expressed in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country
Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational Policies). Relevance of design is the extent to which
the project’s design is consistent with the stated objectives. Efficacy is the extent to which the project’s objectives
were achieved, or are expected to be achieved, taking into account their relative importance. Efficiency is the
extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the opportunity cost of capital
and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. The efficiency dimension generally is not applied to adjustment
operations. Possible ratings for Outcome: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Risk to Development Outcome: The risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or
expected outcomes) will not be maintained (or realized). Possible ratings for Risk to Development Outcome: High,
Significant, Moderate, Negligible to Low, Not Evaluable.
     Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry of the
operation and supported effective implementation through appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate
transition arrangements for regular operation of supported activities after loan/credit closing, toward the
achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: quality at entry and quality of supervision.
Possible ratings for Bank Performance: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
     Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower (including the government and implementing
agency or agencies) ensured quality of preparation and implementation, and complied with covenants and
agreements, toward the achievement of development outcomes. The rating has two dimensions: government
performance and implementing agency(ies) performance. Possible ratings for Borrower Performance: Highly
Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately Unsatisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly
Unsatisfactory.

Preface
This is the Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) for the Food Crisis Response
Development Policy Grant (Trust Fund 92328), which was issued under the auspices of
the Global Food Crisis Response Program.

The grant was approved on May 29, 2008 and closed, as expected, on June 30, 2009. The
grant was for US$5.0 million. A first tranche of US$4.0 million was released, as
expected, on July 1, 2008. A second tranche of US$1.0 million was due to be released on
December 30, 2008 but release was delayed until January 23, 2009.

The report presents findings based on review of the Program Document, the
Implementation Completion and Results Report, aide-memoires and supervision reports,
and other relevant material. John Heath visited Djibouti for IEG in September 2011 to
interview government officials, the staff of partnership agencies, project staff,
beneficiaries, donor representatives, and academics. Bank staff members were
interviewed at headquarters and by phone. Marcellin Diagne carried out the rice price
regression analysis.

The assessment aims, first, to serve an accountability purpose by verifying whether the
operation achieved its intended outcome. Second, the report draws lessons that are
intended to inform future emergency response initiatives of this nature. Third, the
assessment will contribute to a forthcoming IEG study on the global food crisis response.

Following standard IEG procedures, the Government of Djibouti was invited to comment
on the draft PPAR, but no comments were received.

Summary
Since 2005 world-wide increases in commodity prices have potentially reduced the
ability of the poor in Djibouti to feed themselves. The country has few of the natural
resources needed for farming and imports almost all of the food it consumes. Inflation
jumped from 5 percent to 14 percent in the 12-month period to August 2008 as a result of
the global spike in energy and food prices. Under the auspices of the Global Food Crisis
Response Program, which was launched in mid-2008, the Bank prepared a budget
support operation for Djibouti, involving a grant of US$5.0 million.

The objective of the operation was ―to help the Government of Djibouti in reducing
hunger, preventing an increase in poverty and social unrest, and ensuring the fiscal
stability needed to foster medium-term social and economic development.‖ The operation
addressed the following policy areas: food prices; food supply; access to water; targeted
social assistance; and macroeconomic stability. Before the grant was approved on May
29, 2008 the Government adopted a draft additional budget law for fiscal year 2008,
exempting from tax five basic food items (rice, sugar, cooking oil, wheat flour and
powder milk). In each case the tax rate went down from 8 percent to zero, resulting in a
combined fiscal loss equivalent to US$4.0 million. When the grant was approved the first
tranche exactly offset this loss. Release of the second tranche (US$1.0 million) was
conditional on the government’s preparation of an Action Plan to channel direct support
to the most vulnerable households. As supplementary conditions for the second tranche
release the government was expected to provide evidence that (a) progress had been
made in carrying out the agreed program; and (b) the macroeconomic policy framework
was appropriate.

The relevance of project objectives is rated substantial. The objective of preventing an
increase in poverty was relevant when the grant was approved in May 2008 and, despite
the easing of food price inflation in late 2008—which proved to be only a temporary
respite—the objectives of the operation remained relevant at closing in June 2009. The
objectives of the grant operation fitted in well with the strategy developed by the
government and the Bank. Several supporting measures had been taken by government
before the grant was approved: a National Food Security Council was set up in October
2006; a National Food Security and Nutrition Strategy was issued in December 2007;
and a National Social Development Initiative was launched in January 2007. The
relevance of project design is rated modest. The project logic was sound in the sense that
it contained actions needed to address both the short-term and the long-term outcomes
presupposed by the objectives. The design combined a short-term, crisis intervention
(offsetting the loss of tax revenue) with an attempt to strengthen the capacity to withstand
food crises in the longer term. But there were gaps in the results framework. Given the
market structure in Djibouti, it was not clear that removing taxes from basic foods would
reduce their prices as intended. The means by which the objective of containing social
unrest would be achieved were not spelled out.

The objectives of reducing hunger, preventing an increase in poverty, and ensuring fiscal
stability were modestly achieved; the objective of preventing more social unrest was
negligibly achieved. With respect to the objective of reducing hunger, there is no
compelling evidence that the tax exoneration led to a drop in the price of the relevant
                                             x


staples or prevented it from rising. IEG was unable to find any progress reports on
implementation of measures in the Action Plan that were intended to strengthen domestic
food supply. In the course of the grant operation there was a drop in acute malnutrition
among children aged between 6 and 59 months but this was probably the result of food
distribution to vulnerable groups and school feeding, commitments made by other donors
before the food crisis grant was approved, and not through the policies associated with
the grant operation.

There is an overlap between the objectives of reducing hunger and preventing an increase
in poverty (each modestly achieved). The operation did not appear to have any effect on
food prices, which could have helped to prevent an increase in poverty. There is mixed
evidence that preparedness to tackle poverty in the medium term was enhanced by the
grant—on the one hand, completion of the population census was an input toward better
targeting of the poor but, on the other hand, government statements about reform of
social safety nets suggest that the official strategy has evolved less than expected. Since
the operation appears to have had no effect on food prices, it is difficult to conclude that
the containment of social unrest—another project objective (negligibly achieved)—was
driven by actions taken under the grant operation. Finally, the macroeconomic stability
objective was modestly achieved: there was no sustained progress on the three indicators
cited in Policy Matrix (inflation, fiscal deficit, debt sustainability).

Taking into account the ratings for relevance of the objectives (substantial) and relevance
of design (modest), and the modest-to-negligible achievement of the objectives, the
outcome of the operation is assessed as unsatisfactory. The risk to development outcome
is rated significant because commodity prices rose again after the grant operation, there
was a major drought, government social protection strategy is still lacking in detail and
the Action Plan was too sketchy to have much prospect of bearing fruit. Bank
Performance is rated moderately satisfactory. The Bank responded rapidly to Djibouti’s
needs, preparing the project in less than three weeks. The options for intervention were
limited given that that Djibouti’s small IDA allocation was already fully committed. The
Bank was able to combine immediate measures (offsetting the tax exemption) that were
easy to implement with measures intended to enhance social protection in the longer
term. The forward-looking approach toward social protection paved the way for a
follow-on operation, the Employment and Human Capital Social Safety Net Project. On
the other hand, although acknowledging evidence of collusion among food importers, the
Bank failed to consider that the food tax reduction conceivably would not be passed on to
households. There were weaknesses in the results framework and the Bank did not ensure
that monitoring indicators were tracked. Borrower Performance is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. Although government and implementing agency (the Ministry of Finance)
provided appropriate support for the operation, they share with the Bank responsibility
for the shortfall in monitoring. The Action Plan prepared by government was little more
than a list of anticipated commitments from a variety of donors, with no serious weighing
of priorities for addressing constraints on the poor’s access to food.

IEG draws three lessons from the evaluation:

      There is a trade-off between speed and targeting accuracy in the preparation of
       emergency response operations.
                                          xi


   Emergency response can be fruitfully combined with the development of a
    longer-term program.
   It is not self-evident that reducing taxes on food staples will lower their prices: if
    tax reduction is to be used as an instrument there should be sufficient evidence to
    demonstrate that the proceeds will be passed through to the consumer and that the
    poor will be targeted.

1. Background and Context
COUNTRY BACKGROUND

1.1     Djibouti is a tiny country of 830,000 people. Almost three-quarters of the
population are urban, with 58 percent of the nation’s residents living in the capital,
Djibouti-Ville.1 The structure of the economy has changed little since the country
became independent from France in 1977. The country depends on rents deriving from its
strategic location – port revenues and military revenues (Djibouti is a base for counter-
terrorist and anti-piracy operations) – and foreign aid.

1.2     Djibouti has exceptionally good access to world markets through the international
port of Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden, which has recently been extended and upgraded
with investment from the United Arab Emirates. The port is the lynchpin of the economy,
mainly thanks to carriage trade: it is the sole conduit for goods transiting to and from
landlocked Ethiopia, a market of 80 million people. In 2009, through-trade with Ethiopia
accounted for 78 percent of the goods passing through the Port of Djibouti.2

1.3     In recent years, Djibouti’s economic growth has been strong, fueled by fiscal
expansion and large foreign direct investments in the port, tourism, and construction
sectors. Real GDP growth exceeded 5 percent in each of the years from 2007 to 2009,
averaging 5.3 percent.3 Per capita income is relatively high (around US$1,250 in nominal
terms) but the distribution of income is highly skewed. In 1996, the bottom quintile of the
income distribution captured 6.4 percent of national income, falling to 6.0 percent in
2002 (the most recent year for which data are available).4 On poverty levels, according to
the most recent comprehensive survey (2002), 42 percent of the population lived in
absolute poverty and 75 percent were poor relative to the nation’s median level of
consumption.5 Unemployment is the main cause of poverty: 45-60 percent of people of
working age are without a job.6 The major investments in port infrastructure created only
1,000 jobs, of which around 200 went to foreign workers.7

1.4     The country has few of the natural resources needed for farming. It is short of
rainfall, water, and arable land. Rainfall averages 150 mm of rain per year and there are
no perennial surface water courses. Less than five percent of total rainfall reaches the

water table, with the remainder lost through evapotranspiration or discharge to the sea
following flash floods. Under more favorable conditions in the Northwest, Southeast,
and Central zones rainfall averages 200 mm per year; but the seasonal distribution is
uneven. Only 6 percent of the total land area of 23,000 km2 is cultivated. Crops, livestock
and fisheries make up 4 percent of GDP but 20 percent of the population depends on
those activities for its livelihood. Less than 10 percent of the calorie intake derives from
food produced in Djibouti.8 This is a country that imports almost all of the food it
consumes.9

1.5      More than 80 percent of the rural population consists of nomadic and semi-
nomadic herders who manage about 1 million head of small ruminants (goats and sheep)
as well as 50,000 camels and 40,000 head of cattle. Nomads are the most vulnerable
group in Djibouti. They are the first victims of water scarcity, adverse weather, and
hunger. They often lack access to basic health services and their children do not attend
school. In addition to poor rains, pastoral areas in the Northwest and Southeast have been
affected by above?average cereal prices and reduced remittances from abroad. In these
areas, limited pasture and grazing land has affected animal body conditions and
reproduction. Consequently, over the years, income from livestock has fallen.10 In rural
areas, the food consumed by households comes from the following sources: purchases
(75 percent); food aid (13 percent); own production—notably milk (4 percent);
community gifts (4 percent); and transfers from family members living in towns (4
percent).11 Fish is a locally available source of protein but does not play a central part in
the diet. According to one estimate, the potential annual catch of fish and seafood is
50,000 tonnes but, owing to the lack of appropriate vessels and refrigeration, the industry
remains an artisanal activity, with the catch limited to 1,000 tonnes per year.12

1.6     Malnutrition is a significant problem in Djibouti. In 2007, the country’s overall
acute malnutrition rate for children aged 6-59 months was measured at 16.8 percent, with
a 17.4 percent rate in rural areas, well above the 15 percent emergency threshold
established by the World Health Organization. The prevalence of acute malnutrition was
highest in the Northwest Pastoral zone (25 percent of children 6-59 months, Table 1); but,
at 17 percent, it was also relatively high among children in the capital city.

1.7      Since 2005 the world-wide increases in commodity prices have potentially
reduced the ability of the poor in Djibouti to buy the food needed to meet their nutritional
requirements. Inflation jumped from 5 percent to 14 percent in the 12-month period to
August 2008 as a result of the global spike in energy and food prices (Figure 1). The
retail price of the low-quality rice that is a staple in Djibouti jumped by 121 percent
between February 2006 and March 2008. Among the more food insecure were those
persons displaced by conflict in neighboring countries. Djibouti sheltered 15,000
refugees, most from Somalia.13 Two assessments carried out by the World Food Program
(WFP) in 2008 estimated that about 80,000 people in rural areas were food insecure
owing to the combined effect of price shocks and droughts.14

1.8     In Djibouti, social assistance initiatives (safety nets)—comprising in-kind and in-
cash transfers, micro-credit, and public works programs—have, by international
standards, been substantial, absorbing 4.0-4.5 percent of GDP. (In Latin America and
Eastern Europe expenditures have averaged 2.0 percent of GDP.) But social assistance in
Djibouti has been poorly targeted, with poor and vulnerable groups receiving the
equivalent of only 0.5 percent of GDP.15 Most government assistance programs,
especially food and nutrition-related assistance, are targeted to the extreme poor in rural
areas. The majority of poor people who live in urban areas do not receive any direct
public assistance, either in the form of cash or other means, except for access to
microcredit. Targeting mechanisms are weak, particularly for the urban poor. 16 Until
recently, government’s social protection strategy was limited; until the Bank raised the
issue there was no discussion, for example, of conditional cash transfers.

PROJECT CONTEXT

1.9     The Djibouti Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant was one of a series
of operations funded through the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP). The
GFRP was launched by the World Bank in mid-2008 to mitigate the harmful effects of
soaring food prices and to help countries adapt to higher and more volatile prices. At the
2008 Spring Meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF),
Governors made clear that they considered alleviating the short run welfare impacts of
spiking food prices, and helping to ensure that countries could be better prepared to cope
with similar future crises, top priorities for World Bank Group assistance. The Governors
also made clear that the World Bank needed to work with the UN system, other donors,
the private sector and civil society organizations to find rapid and effective solutions to
the crisis.17

1.10       The objectives of the GFRP were to:

          Reduce the negative impacts of high and volatile food prices on the lives of the
           poor in a timely manner;
          Support governments in the design of sustainable policies that mitigate the
           adverse impacts of high and more volatile food prices on poverty; and
          Support broad based growth in productivity and market participation in
           agriculture to ensure an adequate supply response as part of a sustained
           improvement in food supply.18

1.11 The Djibouti Food Crisis Response Policy Grant complemented both earlier and
current operations by the Bank and the IMF. At the same time that the food crisis grant
was being prepared, the IMF was developing a US$6.5 million Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF) whose purpose was to improve Djibouti’s fiscal stance, increase

the share of social and infrastructure projects in total spending and improve
competitiveness. The Bank worked closely with the IMF team on the PRGF, helping to
formulate performance criteria, particularly for energy, public administration reform and
social protection, the sectors in which the Bank had invested. Of these investments, the
most relevant to the food crisis was a Bank-supported FY2008 Urban Poverty Reduction
Project which centered on employment creation through public works, potentially
bolstering the food purchasing power of the urban poor. Also, relevant was a FY2008
grant from the Institutional Development Fund (IDF) which sought to establish a national
monitoring and evaluation system. When the food crisis grant was prepared, the Bank
team sought simultaneously to use the IDF grant to strengthen capacity for tracking the
well-being of groups vulnerable to food and fuel price spikes. The team also planned to
engage the government more actively in a dialogue about the reform of social assistance.

1.12 The Program Document refers to limited donor involvement in Djibouti, but goes
on to list several agencies at work in the country (European Commission, African
Development Bank, Arab Bank for Development Cooperation, World Food Program,
United Nations Development Program and UNICEF). The largest provider of grant
assistance was the European Union which committed to invest US$31.3 million in the
water and energy sectors between 2008 and 2012. With respect to the donor assistance
most relevant to the food crisis, the World Food Program offered the largest support
(US$19.8 million in 2007-2012), shared between feeding vulnerable groups and school
feeding. The first of these initiatives provides food relief to rural populations in the
seasons and zones with the greatest famine risk. This entails provision of emergency food
rations, aid to refugees, and food-for-work programs. The school feeding program
provides two meals per day to each child in rural primary schools, as well as take-home
food for girls in grades 3-5 who attend school for at least 80 percent of the academic year.
In addition to this work by WFP, UNICEF runs vitamin A supplementation and de-
worming initiatives in rural schools. In towns, local nongovernment organizations—
including the Union Nationale des Femmes Djiboutiennes (National Djiboutian Women’s
Union)—have small programs that distribute food to the poor.19


2. Objectives, Design, and their Relevance
2.1     According to the main text of the Program Document, ―The objective of the
proposed Grant is to help the Government of Djibouti in reducing hunger, preventing an
increase in poverty and social unrest, and ensuring the fiscal stability needed to foster
medium-term social and economic development.‖20 The Policy Matrix (further
elaborated in the government’s Letter of Development Policy)21 identifies the main

policy areas, actions/outputs, and expected outcomes of the operation (Figure 2).22 Some
of the policy areas affect achievement of more than one of the outcomes flagged in the
statement of objectives. To illustrate, elimination of the tax on basic food items (an
output) may make food more affordable for the poor (an intermediate outcome) which
may in turn help to reduce hunger, prevent an increase in poverty, and prevent an
increased in social unrest (outcomes in the statement of objectives).

2.2      The project approach was fully consistent with the menu of options offered by the
Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP), as outlined in Box 1 below. On the face
of it, there was a choice to use grant resources for budget support or fund an emergency
investment operation. In reality, the options were more constrained. The Program
Document indicates that the Bank chose budget support because the IDA allocation to
Djibouti was small and fully committed to health, education and urban development.23
The only option was to go for emergency assistance through the GFRP. In any event,
budget support was an attractive option because it was easy to administer and quick to
disburse, offsetting, at one stroke, the loss in revenue to the government from the tax
exoneration. The decision to make delivery of the second tranche contingent on the

   The Policy Matrix in the Program Document groups the expected actions/outputs under headings labeled
as sub-objectives, which essentially constitute the main policy areas that will be addressed to achieve the
objectives in the main text, in the same way that components group the outputs and activities of an
investment loan. Therefore, IEG organizes the discussion in this report around the statement of objectives
in the main text of the Program Document, examining the evidence on the outputs and outcomes identified
in the main policy areas flagged in the Policy Matrix as they bear on achievement of the objectives.

government’s preparation of an Action Plan would address ways to target assistance to
the poor and also identify productivity-enhancing investments that would strengthen
domestic food supply.

Box 1. Options Available under the Global Food Crisis Response Program

In the GFRP Framework Document, the following was proposed as an ―indicative but
non-exhaustive‖ list of the interventions that were eligible for support under the program:

―(i) Enhancing household food security by strengthening targeted safety nets and
maternal and child health and nutrition services and improving both availability of food
and the ability of vulnerable groups to buy food. Interventions might include cash transfer
programs, self-targeted public works or feeding programs, provision of subsidized food
to poor households, and so forth. The Bank could also provide emergency financing for
food imports. These interventions could be financed through development policy
operations, rapid response investment lending, or a combination of the two.

(ii) Lowering domestic food prices in the short term. This includes financing the revenue
losses to the budget associated with lowering or removing import tariffs, removal of
government monopolies over the import or procurement of grains, and so forth.

(iii) Stabilizing highly volatile food prices and assisting governments to make better use
of risk management instruments in dealing with food price unpredictability. The Bank
would also provide financing and risk management tools and technical assistance with
risk mitigation and commodity market hedging products.

(iv) Enhancing the consistency between emergency price policy measures and longer
term measures required for lasting solutions. This includes funding for rapid
assessments, improved communications strategies and removing policy distortions
related to food pricing.

(v) Enhancing long-term food security by helping ensure that short-term supply
responses are consistent with and can transition to sustainable medium and longer-term
responses to the changing world food situation. Thus, by way of example, the GFRP
might finance the immediate import and distribution of seeds and fertilizer. It would also
prepare the groundwork for longer term funding of technology dissemination and
extension programs, investment in irrigation rehabilitation and improved logistics (e.g.,
storage, handling, transport, other infrastructure).‖

2.3     IEG rates the relevance of the operation’s objectives as substantial. The objective
of preventing an increase in poverty was relevant when the grant was approved in May
2008 and, despite the easing of food price inflation in late 2008, the objectives of the
operation remained relevant at closing in June 2009. Without significant food production
of its own, without buffer stocks and with weak border controls, Djibouti is peculiarly
vulnerable to volatility in world markets. Commodity price spikes have an immediate
effect on the welfare of the poor calling for an emergency operation of the type that the
Bank mounted. The inclusion of an objective seeking to prevent an increase in social
                                                 8


unrest reflected the spirit of the discussion with government and development partners
during the preparation mission. There was a consensus that the commodity price spikes
threatened to sabotage any prospect of restoring peace to the region.

2.4     The objectives of the grant operation were consistent with the strategy developed
by the government and the Bank. Well before the grant was prepared, a National Food
Security Council had been established in the President’s Office in October 2006. In
December 2007, the National Food Security and Nutrition Strategy was released by the
Ministry of Agriculture. On a parallel track, the National Social Development Initiative
(INDS) 24 was launched in January 2007—comprising a ―second generation‖ of the
poverty reduction strategy that had been launched in 2004. Both strategies combined
measures to increase food availability and measures to enhance access to food by the
poor (by stimulating employment and increasing purchasing power).

2.5     The objectives of the grant operation are echoed in the latest statement of Bank
strategy for Djibouti. The FY2009-2012 Country Assistance Strategy includes among the
outcomes the Bank expects to influence, ―strengthening social protection and direct
support to the poor.‖ In addition to supporting social safety nets, this document also
indicates that the Bank will invest in crop and livestock development and in
improvements to wells and other hydraulic infrastructure.25 However, there were also
elements of overlap and overstretch in the objectives for the short time frame of the
operation (for example, reducing hunger) and they appears to have been boilerplate rather
than specific to Djibouti: the exact same statement was used for the Burundi food crisis
grant (evaluated separately by IEG).

2.6     The relevance of design refers to the quality of the results framework: the project
logic linking the project’s inputs and outputs to the outcomes that the project seeks to
achieve. The logic was sound in the sense that it contained actions needed to address both
the short-term and the long-term outcomes presupposed by the objectives. The design
combined a short-term, crisis intervention (offsetting the loss of tax revenue) with an
attempt to strengthen the capacity to withstand food crises in the longer term. This was in
tune with the spirit of the GFRP, which argued that, in the long run, reducing global
hunger would require substantial investments in agricultural productivity growth and
support for safety nets and nutrition programs.26 The designers of the grant operation
sought, through the medium of the Action Plan, to launch investments appropriate to
boosting farming and fishing, as well as stimulate a dialogue between the different arms
of government, about how best to develop a more comprehensive safety net.

2.7     Repairing and upgrading wells was a sound means to reduce livestock mortality
and improved the livelihood of pastoral nomads. Buying small fishing boats would have a
direct impact on the incomes of artisanal fishermen. (The impact on food import

  World Bank 2010b: 4. This was also a key message in the 2008 World Development Report (World
Bank 2007).
                                               9


dependency was less clear, partly because most of the population is not accustomed to
eating fish and, even if they changed their habits, the amount by which the catch could be
increased would not allow for much substitution of other foods.) Poverty mapping and
the development of targeting mechanisms would help channel assistance more cost-
effectively to the poor.

2.8     But there were two flaws in the results framework. First, the project logic assumes
that the elimination of tax on basic food items will necessarily increase the poor’s ability
to buy food. The Program Documents admits that, in terms of feeding the poor, there
were limits to the effectiveness of the tax exoneration.27 (Indeed, a recent study
conducted by the World Food Program demonstrates this lack of effectiveness.28) On
the one hand, the five items selected for tax exoneration were representative of the typical
food basket of non-expatriate residents of Djibouti. Three of the staples—sugar, rice and
wheat flour—between them accounted for 62 percent of the cost of the food basket and
66 percent of its calorific content. On the other hand, there was a problem of leakage, the
removal of taxes on these items benefiting the better off as well as the poorest
households. Also, there were only a handful of importers, competition was limited and
traders were able to agree among themselves about the prices they would set, and
whether or not (and with what delay) they would pass on the proceeds of the tax cut to
consumers by proportionately lowering retail prices. This problem of trader collusion was
acknowledged in the Program Document.29 There was second problem with the results
framework: it is not clear from the Policy Matrix which actions support attainment of the
objective of preventing an increase in social unrest.

2.9        Balancing these considerations, the relevance of design is rated modest.


3. Implementation
3.1      Annex B includes a timeline for the grant operation. An identification mission
visited Djibouti in May 2008, two weeks after the government had decreed that the tax be
lifted on the five food staples. From that point preparation of the grant was swift. The
operation concept was reviewed on May 16 and on May 29 the Board approved the grant.
Given that—in the Bank’s judgment—the government, in concert with other donors, was
already taking steps to address the water supply and agriculture production challenges
that it had committed to in the letter of development policy (see Annex B, Box B1), the
supervision missions concentrated on advancing the cause of improved social protection,
with a focus on the urban poor. In September 2008, the Bank organized a social
protection workshop, intended to stimulate debate about the diversity of options and to
introduce government officials to approaches (including conditional cash transfers) that
had been successfully pursued in other countries. Follow-up consisted of preparation by
the Bank of a technical note on social protection options, delivered to government in June

2009; and participation by six government officials in study tours to two countries
implementing vanguard social protection schemes (under the auspices of the South/South
Exchange trust fund).

3.2     The Grant Agreement records that the following action was taken before approval
of the operation: ―the Government has adopted a draft additional budget law for fiscal
year 2008 providing, in particular, for the exemption from payment of the domestic
consumption tax on five basic food items (rice, sugar, cooking oil, wheat flour and
powder milk)‖.30 In each case the tax rate went down from 8 percent to zero, resulting in
a combined fiscal loss equivalent to US$4.0 million. The first tranche of the grant—
released as soon as the operation was approved—exactly offset the drop in government
revenue. Release of the second tranche (US$1.0 million) was conditional on the
government’s preparation of ―an action plan, satisfactory to the World Bank, to channel
direct support to the most vulnerable households‖. As supplementary conditions for the
second tranche release the government was expected to provide evidence: (a) that
progress had been made in carrying out the agreed program; and (b) that the
macroeconomic policy framework was appropriate. The terms of the ―agreed program‖
were set out in a Letter of Development Policy that was annexed to the grant program
document (Annex B, Box B1).

3.3     Delivery of the second tranche was authorized in January 2009, one month later
than planned, following submission by the government of an Action Plan for addressing
food security and social assistance, and confirmation by the IMF that Djibouti was
implementing the agreed measures to contain inflation and reduce the fiscal deficit. The
operation closed, as initially expected, on June 30, 2009.

3.4     During implementation, but outside the framework of the grant operation, the
government took steps to broaden the tax base. These measures included the introduction
of a value-added tax in January 2009. However, the VAT was not applied to the food
staples that were targeted for exoneration under the program supported by the grant
operation.


4. Achievement of the Objectives
Reduce hunger
4.1     Of the various outputs cited in the Policy Matrix, the ones that would appear to
bear most directly on the objective of reducing hunger are: removal of tax from imports
of basic food items; scaling up of fisheries; and upgrading of wells. The first of these
would help to reduce hunger by making food more affordable. The second and third
would tackle hunger from the domestic supply side, aiming to promote production by
fishermen and herders.

4.2      There is little evidence to suggest that the tax exoneration—implemented on April
29, 2008—led to a reduction in the price of food (in the sense that prices were lower than
they would have been without the exoneration). Taking the food basket as a whole, prices
were higher after the tax exoneration than before it, rising at a higher rate than the overall
consumer price index (Figure 3). With respect to the five staples from which tax was
removed, in the period covered by the grant operation (June 2008 to June 2009) the price
of these staples declined relative to the 2008 peak—but the drop occurred several months
after this. This is unexpected because storage capacity around Djibouti-Ville harbor is
fairly limited and the small volumes of goods imported are released quickly to the
market: there is no obvious reason for local prices to substantially lag world prices.
Figure 4 presents the data for rice and wheat flour, which account respectively for 22
percent and 20 percent of the caloric content of the typical family food basket. Prices
were, on average, higher when the operation closed (and have remained higher since),
compared to the period before the price shock of 2007-2008—mirroring worldwide
trends.

Source: The retail price in Djibouti City is from the FEWSNET data series (USAID) and refers to low-quality (“Belem?) rice. The
vertical line indicates the date when the 8 percent import tax on these staples was removed (April 29, 2008).

4.3     Given Djibouti’s dependence on imports and the openness of the trade regime, it
is reasonable to suppose that the easing of prices in late 2008 was driven more by the fall
of world prices than removal of the tax (the rate of which was only 8 percent). Evidence
from a recent survey of urban food markets suggests that, overall, food markets in
Djibouti are closely aligned with world markets.31 Data for comparable products and for a
long enough period are only available for rice (Figure 5). A regression of prices of Belem
rice in Djibouti-Ville on world prices of an equivalent grade of rice and a dummy
variable flagging the food found no statistically significant relationship between the
presence or absence of tax and the retail price of rice in Djibouti.32 It is possible that
removal of taxes increased traders’ margins rather than being passed through to
consumers (an observation supported by various accounts about collusion between the
five or so large-scale enterprises that control imports). Given that rice is a key staple
(second only to sugar), the scope for reducing hunger via the reduction in food tax may
have been constrained by collusion, preventing a price reduction.

   The logarithm of monthly local prices for Belem rice in Djibouti, for the period January 2004-May 2011
(88 observations) was regressed on the logarithm of contemporaneous monthly world prices for an
equivalent product (Thai Rice A1, 100 percent broken, fob Bangkok) and a dummy variable equal to one
when the food tax was applied and zero when it was not. The coefficient on the monthly world price of
rice was 0.13 (p=0.000), and the coefficient on the dummy variable for the food tax was 0.024 (p=0.3835).
The correlation between domestic and international rice prices was 0.71.

4.4     What was the overall trend in the cost of the food basket? The data for the main
staples in the food basket show that, taken together and allowing for the weight of each
item in typical calorie intake, the cost of the basket declined in real terms between 2008
and 2009, but leveled off at a position well above that in 2006 (Figure 6). The biggest
single contributor to calories in Djibouti—sugar, accounting for 24 percent of the typical
intake—bucks the overall trend: costs for this item continued to rise after 2008 (Annex B,
Table B3; Figure B3a).

4.5     In addition to the tax exoneration, the grant operation contemplated other
measures that were intended to contribute to the objective of reducing hunger. The
measures bearing most directly on this objective were scaling up fisheries and upgrading
wells, both intended to strengthen domestic food supply. These measures formed part of
an Action Plan that the government was required to prepare—as a condition for release of
the second tranche of the grant. Government submitted this plan to the Bank in December
2008. Most of the initiatives in the Action Plan had previously been presented in the
government’s National Food Security Strategy (2007) and in the Djiboutian Social
Development Initiative (INDS, 2008).

4.6     According to the Action Plan, US$1.0 million would be sought (from a donor yet
to be specified) to buy fishing boats for the poor (see Annex B, Table B4 of this report
for details). The aim was to increase fish output and create employment by expanding
artisanal fishing, benefiting 1,080 households directly; and benefiting a larger number of
poor households indirectly by making available an alternative source of cheap food. In
addition, US$12.0 million would be solicited from the African Development Bank, IFAD
and the Saudi Fund to finance water supply for expanding crop and livestock production.
It was estimated that the rehabilitation of 10 rural water pumps would benefit around
10,000 people, including nomadic pastoralists who have lost part of their herd to
drought.33

4.7      IEG requested but was unable to obtain progress reports on action plan
implementation. It also asked unsuccessfully for a copy of the 2011 budget, with a view
to assessing whether the expected financing showed up in the public investment plan.
IEG was unable to determine whether the intended investments in the fishery sector and
in water supply were actually made, or whether output from crop farming, livestock
raising and fishing picked up following the grant operation.

4.8     As Annex B, Table B4 of this report shows, commitments for agriculture rose
from US$11.5 million at the end of 2007 to US$12.6 million at the end of 2009. There is
no indication how much of this went to fisheries or agricultural water supply. Less than
half of the measures listed in the Action Plan are to be found in the Public Investment
Program (PIP) published by government; and all of those listed at the end of 2009 had
already been posted by the end of 2007 (Annex B, Table B4). This suggests either that
preparation of the Action Plan did not lead to the mobilization of fresh resources or that
the PIP presented by government does not list all the spending made. Both explanations
are likely true. There are obvious omissions: the World Food Program has a major
involvement in Djibouti but it is not listed in the PIP; the government is known to have
bought farms in Ethiopia and Sudan but the purchase has been described by the IMF as
―off-budget‖.34 These extra-territorial farms35 are a personal project of the president and
there has been no formal cost-benefit analysis of the viability of purchasing and operating
them. During the mission, IEG encountered many skeptics who argued that, given low
crop yields and high overland transport costs, food from this source would cost much
more than supplies purchased on world markets and delivered by ship.36

4.9     The evidence reviewed so far in this section does not support the conclusion that
steps taken under the grant operation helped to reduce hunger. To put matters in historical
perspective, based on data from various sources, the International Food Policy Research
Institute has estimated that there is a slight downward trend in the prevalence of hunger
in Djibouti. The country’s score on Global Hunger Index was 30.8 for 1990, 25.8 for
1996, 25.3 for 2001 and 22.5 for 2011 (with data for this last reference year taken from
sources spanning 2004-2009).37 More specifically, there is some evidence that chronic
hunger eased over the period of the operation. Two comparable nutrition surveys were
conducted by UNICEF in 2007 and 2010, conveniently bracketing the food crisis grant
operation. The survey results show that between 2007 and 2010 acute malnutrition
(wasting, or low weight for height) declined, but chronic malnutrition (stunting, or low
height for age) increased. This pattern was the same in both urban and rural areas (Figure
7).

4.10 The Action Plan prepared under the auspices of the grant operation does list
investments in food distribution to vulnerable groups and school feeding (by the World
Food Program) and it is probably these crisis interventions rather than other measures
that brought down the level of acute malnutrition. IEG interviewed representatives of
agencies responsible for these interventions (UNICEF as well as the World Food
Program) and confirmed that the relevant programs had proceeded. In particular, the
number of children benefiting from WFP school feeding in rural areas has increased
steadily: 12,000 children were covered in 2008 and by 2012 the program is on track to
reach 18,000 children. Given the lack of apparent effect of dropping the food tax on food
prices, it would be difficult to make the case that the actions supported by the operation
were responsible for reducing hunger in Djibouti.

4.11 All in all, the gaps in the results chain lead IEG to the conclusion that attainment
of the hunger reduction objective attributable to the grant was modest.

Prevent an increase in poverty
4.12 The evidence presented in the previous section also bears on attainment of the
objective of preventing an increase in poverty and by extension the modest rating applies
to achievement of this objective. However, the grant operation also involved preparation
of an Action Plan by government, a key aspect of which was to lay the foundation for
medium-term measures to tackle poverty. Did preparation of the Action Plan result in a
strengthening of the approach to reducing poverty that, even if not realized in the course
of the grant operation, might pay off in the medium term?
                                                   17


4.13 First, the Action Plan included measures to improve targeting of the poor. A step
in this direction involved completion of the 2009 population and housing census—which
was halted in mid-2008 owing to lack of financing. Before the 2009 census was finalized,
population statistics were extrapolations from a 1991 demographic survey; there had been
no census conducted since 1983. Government officials told IEG that without the support
from the food crisis grant it is unlikely that the 2009 census would have been completed;
and without that data it would not have been possible to refine the system of geographic
targeting—a process that was underway at the time of IEG’s mission. The census results
are being used to define living standard zones of 100 households each. The grant has thus
made an important, long-term contribution to poverty tracking.

4.14 Second, the Action Plan sought to identify more cost-effective measures of social
assistance. A key output to achieving this was the launch of a dialogue about social
protection. The Bank organized a workshop around that theme in September 2008, it
promoted study tours for officials (with visits to Benin and Ethiopia), and in June 2009 it
shared with government a Policy Note on social protection, an output of the operation.

4.15 Did the government’s preparation of the Action Plan lead to an evolution of
thinking about social protection and its bearing on the food crisis? The scale of the
adjustment needed was quite substantial, as the Bank noted: ―Although there is a clear
understanding that responses to the food crisis require a multidimensional approach, the
food security strategy is dominated by programs to ensure food supply through
agricultural production, domestic and abroad. Some programs in the food security
strategy show conflicting objectives with those of the Djiboutian Initiative for Social
Development (INDS). Moreover, neither the food security strategy nor the INDS propose
actions which could effectively help to reduce the vulnerabilities of the poor population
in short-term. Embedding the food security strategy into the INDS and formulating a
coherent strategy for social assistance are therefore paramount for an effective response
to the challenges posed by the food crisis.‖38

4.16 One way to assess whether Action Plan preparation promoted an evolution of
government thinking on social protection is to compare the content of three drafts of the
INDS strategy, prepared between 2007 and 2011.39 The first of these drafts (prepared in
2007, released in 2008) makes no reference to food security, and provides little detail on
social protection (but notes that safety net initiatives launched under the first poverty
reduction strategy were ―not implemented satisfactorily‖).40 The second draft has a long
discussion of food security but the relevant government interventions are focused on the
production side with limited linkage to social protection and safety nets. The government
measures taken are listed as follows: (i) gifts of farm machinery to market garden
cooperatives; (ii) removal of taxes on farm machinery and agricultural inputs; (iii)
elimination of taxes on basic commodities; (iv) improved management of surface water;
(v) famine emergency warning systems; (vi) price subsidies for essential products; and

(vii) distribution of food to the vulnerable. In addition, the strategy outlines a new
initiative to build up strategic stocks, based on the output of staple foods from farms that
the Djibouti government had just acquired in Sudan (16,000 ha) and Ethiopia (5,000
ha).41 The third draft (which was prepared in February 2011 and provides a preliminary
overview of strategy for the next phase of INDS: 2011-2015) has a section on ―food
security and rural development‖ but the actions proposed are all production related:
development of water supply; oasis agriculture; livestock; small-scale fishing; and (once
again) ―offshore farming‖ linked to the buildup of security stocks.42 While the latest
version of INDS refers to education, health and poverty reduction it has no section on
social protection and there is no reference to cash transfers as a possible approach (even
though this was the key topic in the September 2008 workshop).43

4.17 There is further evidence of the absence of fundamental change in the Djiboutian
mindset on responses to the food crisis. A high-profile seminar chaired by the President
of the Republic in May 2009 involved presentations by each ministry of actions that
would be taken in 2009-2011 followed by questions from members of the public.44 This
detailed set of presentations reveals substantial overlap on the production side with the
Action Plan that the government presented to the Bank in December 2008 (although
surprisingly perhaps there was no reference to the government’s purchase of farms in
other countries). With the exception of calls to control marketing margins on food
staples, there was next to nothing presented about food security from the demand side—
ways to prop up the purchasing power and increase food access by the poor and
vulnerable.

4.18 To conclude, attainment of the objective of preventing an increase in poverty is
rated modest because the elimination of the food tax seems to have had virtually no
impact on food prices faced by the poor and because there is no evidence that the
government’s preparation of the Action Plan led to an evolution in thinking on ways to
address poverty that might bear fruit in the medium-term.

Prevent an increase in social unrest
4.19 In this case, the aim was to prevent unrest and riots from higher food prices.
During the period before and after approval of the grant there is no evidence (for
example, newspaper reports) of civil disturbance in Djibouti. (There were some protests
in early 2011 but these seem to have been a gesture of solidarity with pro-democracy
movements in other countries—the ―Arab Spring‖ uprisings.) Informal comments picked
up during the IEG mission stressed the lack of a culture of protest and a general
quiescence in poor neighborhoods. The lack of a dense net of civil society organizations
possibly reduces the scope for popular mobilization.

4.20 The absence of social unrest cannot be attributed to the removal of the food tax
associated with the operation. As already demonstrated, removing the tax appears not to
have led to lower food prices. Food prices continued to be high, and there was still no
unrest. Other than tax removal, none of the other actions sponsored by the operation had
a direct bearing on social unrest. Therefore, attainment of the objective of preventing
more social unrest is rated negligible.

Ensure the fiscal stability needed to foster medium-term economic and
social development
4.21 The policy area supporting this objective stressed macroeconomic (rather than
merely fiscal) stability. The outcomes that government actions were expected to affect
were: containment of inflation; control of the fiscal deficit; and preservation (or
improvement) of debt sustainability.45 This section examines the extent to which these
three outcomes were achieved.

4.22 First, inflation dropped sharply between the start and the end of the grant
operation, falling from 12.0 percent in 2008 to 1.7 percent in 2009 (see Figure 1 above),
but it was not maintained over the medium term. The initial steep drop reflected the
worldwide trend in commodity prices, particularly for food and fuel. The subsequent
rebound in world prices pushed the inflation rate in Djibouti to 4 percent in 2010 with
expectations that it will reach 8.5 percent in 2011.46 These trends illustrate the close
integration of Djibouti with the world market, reflecting the openness of the trade regime.

4.23 Second, over the course of the grant operation, the fiscal position improved
initially, exceeding expectations (Table 2). By the end of 2008 there was a fiscal surplus
(1.3 percent of GDP), largely explained by a tripling in the inflow of foreign grants.
However, the fiscal position deteriorated sharply in 2009: the balance was -4.9 percent of
GDP compared to the -2.4 percent projected when the grant was prepared. This
deterioration was the result of a jump in spending and a drop in the value of grants. Some
of the spending increase derived from the extra-budgetary outlays on inputs and
equipment for state-owned farms in Ethiopia and Sudan.47

4.24 Third, since the start of the grant operation there has been no improvement in debt
sustainability. In 2007, the IMF drew attention to the ―high risk of debt distress‖ bearing
on both external and domestic government debt.48 External debt, comprising public and
public guaranteed debt was estimated at 55-60 percent of GDP. Domestic government
debt, including domestic arrears, was estimated at 20-25 percent of GDP. Contrary to
IMF projections when the grant operation was launched, debt sustainability did not
improve. According to a recent projection, ―the net present value of public debt as a share

of GDP (estimated at roughly 50 percent) will remain above the 30 percent threshold that
the IMF deems sustainable, given Djibouti’s economic fundamentals.‖49

4.25 Attainment of the fiscal stability objective is rated modest, because none of the
data cited in this section show sustained progress over the medium term.

5. Ratings
Outcome
5.1     The outcome of the grant operation is rated unsatisfactory. The objectives were
substantially relevant, finding an echo in the government and Bank strategies that were
current at closing. The design of the program was modestly relevant to the objectives. In
particular, the project logic assumed that the elimination of tax on basic food items would
necessarily increase the poor’s ability to buy food, which was not the case. Three of
objectives were modestly achieved; achievement of the social unrest objective was
negligible. There is no compelling evidence that the tax exemption or other measures
taken under the project contained food prices and contributed to the objective of reducing

hunger. The fall in acute malnutrition was more likely driven by emergency feeding
programs sponsored by other donors, commitments that preceded the operation and the
results of other efforts outside the actions of the program. The Action Plan that
government prepared under grant auspices was an opportunity to prepare better
approaches to social protection; but this evaluation was not able to find decisive evidence
of a change in the government strategy on these matters. The project results chain does
not support the inference that the absence of social unrest was the result of actions taken
under the project. Finally, although the fiscal situation improved somewhat during the
first half of the grant operation they deteriorated in 2009, so therefore did not achieve
stability in the medium term.

Risk to Development Outcome
5.2     Risk to development outcome is rated significant. After weathering the price
shock of 2007-2008, Djibouti has been hit by the effects of three successive years of
drought. Conditions are particularly dire in areas dependent on livestock incomes—herd
losses of 70 to 100 percent have been reported. Currently the Northwest, Central
Highlands, and Southeast Corridor have severe difficulties in obtaining food at an
accessible price, while the Central Lowlands and Southeast Border have moderate
difficulties in this respect. Household food deficits are developing in the poorer quarters
of Djibouti City and other urban areas.50 Overall, 14 percent of urban households faced
food deficits; the proportion in rural areas was 38 percent. In the drought appeal that was
launched by the government in 2010, 120,000 people (farmers, nomads, pastoral
communities and refugees) were identified as at risk.51 Food deficits will likely increase
in Djibouti in the coming years, owing to the growing volatility of world prices and more
frequent periods of severe drought. ―This situation constitutes a major threat to human
development, particularly among children who face one of the highest rates of
malnutrition in the world.‖52

5.3      The government’s decision to continue the tax exemption for the food imports
targeted by the grant operation may ease pressure on household budgets, although the
evidence presented in this report suggests that tax cuts did not significantly influence
retail prices and were probably not passed on to consumers.

5.4     The outlook for improved social protection is mixed. On the one hand, the Bank-
supported Employment and Human Capital Social Safety Net Project, approved in June
2010, extended the dialogue with government that had taken place under the food crisis
response grant. Although the food security action plan developed under grant auspices
was, as noted above, sketchy, the dialogue that it triggered was an important step, one
that the follow-on project could build on. It is now helping to strengthen the social
assistance options (for example, through workfare or cash transfer programs) that were
suggested but not fleshed out in the action plan that the food crisis grant supported. The

aim is to develop a core safety net program which extends to urban areas (where most of
the poor live), thus creating a means to mitigate future food price hikes like that
addressed by the food crisis response grant.

5.5     On the other hand, as this report has argued, the preliminary draft of the next
phase of the Djiboutian Social Development Initiative (INDS, 2011-2015) shows that
much more work is needed to develop the more comprehensive social protection strategy
that the Bank has been advocating; and the government’s continuing support for off-shore
farming (despite persuasive counter-arguments from the World Food Program53) is
neither fiscally prudent nor transparent (since the expenses are off-budget). Finally, the
Action Plan prepared by government was too schematic to offer much prospect that it
would subsequently generate significant results.

Bank Performance
5.6     Quality at entry is rated moderately satisfactory. The project’s objectives were
substantially relevant given the clear risks that the commodity price spikes represented to
the poor in import-dependent Djibouti. They also meshed well with simultaneous efforts
by the Bank to strengthen the national monitoring and evaluation system and to broaden
the dialogue on social safety nets. The Bank had limited room for maneuver in Djibouti:
the IDA allocation was small and already fully committed to health, education and urban
development. The only option was to go for emergency assistance through the Global
Food Crisis Response Program. Budget support was the right vehicle in the
circumstances because it was easy to administer and quick to disburse, offsetting, at one
stroke, the loss in revenue to the government from the tax exoneration; it also provided
government with the necessary flexibility to efficiently allocate their available resources.
The funds could have been passed through to other donors with existing emergency
programs.54 The Bank investigated this option and found that the potential for rapid and
effective scale-up of the existing programs was limited.

5.7     The project was a timely response to the crisis in Djibouti and was prepared in
less than three weeks. Preparation made the best use of available guidance from the Bank
network about design options available under the Global Food Crisis Response Program.
The identification and preparation mission was well staffed. The analysis underpinning
the operation was facilitated by Bank inputs that were available shortly before the grant
was prepared: an evaluation of results from the first Poverty Reduction Strategy (2004-
2006); a poverty map prepared in 2007; and a Country Economic Memorandum and a
Public Expenditure Review completed in late 2006. The Bank took care to verify that
government actions outside the proposed grant operation were supportive of the overall
project aim of alleviating the effects of food price rises: specifically, government had
already backed the distribution of food vouchers in poor neighborhoods of Djibouti Ville;
and the launch of a new food-for-work program (supported by the World Food Program).

  Under the GFRP, funds could only go from the Bank to government; but government could then transfer
an equivalent amount to other donors—the approach taken in Burundi, for example.
                                                     23


Combining the measure to boost fiscal space with attempts to start a dialogue with
government around social protection was astute and forward looking, making it more
likely that this small, emergency operation would leave some trace in the long run.

5.8     Nevertheless, there were some significant weaknesses in design relevance—in
particular, the false assumption that removing taxes would make food more accessible to
the poor. Given the crisis response nature of this operation, the Program Document
invokes Operational Policy 8.60, stating that the team had insufficient time to adequately
address all design considerations.55 However, in its description of the country context, the
same document goes into some detail on the uncompetitive structure of the market in
Djibouti, giving ample cause for concern that the operation’s primary instrument (tax
exoneration) would not have the desired effect on food prices.56 The Bank apparently had
the necessary information to make an informed judgment about the viability of the
proposed approach. Yet the market constraint is not mentioned in the discussion of risks
connected to the operation.57 Also, the design of monitoring and evaluation was flawed
(see below).

5.9      Supervision quality is rated moderately satisfactory. The missions were used not
just to supervise the food crisis grant but also to support complementary institutional
development funds aimed at strengthening monitoring and evaluation for social
protection, and social security reform.58 This helped lay the foundation for the follow-on
Employment and Human Capital Social Safety Net Project, which extended the dialogue
with government on social protection. The September 2008 workshop included a
comprehensive presentation by the Bank of international experience on social protection.
It was apparently well attended and the presentations reportedly provoked a lively
discussion. There was solid follow-up involving study tours for senior officials to Benin
and Ethiopia (to study social safety programs in practice); and preparation by Bank staff
of a Policy Note, which benefited from detailed peer review and was technically sound.
However, there was no reporting on the monitoring indicators identified in the Policy
Matrix and in Table 3 of the Program Document.

5.10       Overall, Bank performance is rated moderately satisfactory.

   ―…the domestic market organization is unfavorable. There are only 20-30 traders serving the local
market, controlling all of the supplies to the country. Since a single cargo ship of rice covers several
months of Djibouti's consumption, there are only few market operations which are highly specialized
(there are no more than 2-3 operators per product). The oligopolistic market structure incites collusive
behavior and traders are believed to be in tacit agreements. There are also local monopolies in the retail
market. This causes higher price levels than in neighboring markets‖ (World Bank 2008b: 3).

Borrower Performance
5.11 The performance of the government is rated moderately unsatisfactory owing to
shortcomings in monitoring and the Action Plan. Preparation of the grant operation
proceeded smoothly. Although it was not a condition for grant financing the government
took various actions that were consistent with the spirit of the operation: it extended the
tax exemption program to pasta (an important component of the staple food basket) and
did not tax staples when the value-added tax was introduced in January 2009. In the
November 2008 supervision mission the Bank reported that the government had not yet
completed all parts of the Action Plan, finalization of which was a condition for release
of the second tranche. The plan that was eventually submitted in December 2008 was
rather schematic—little more than a summary of existing donor operations, rather than an
attempt to develop new approaches and mobilize new funding. Also, there was no
monitoring framework and two years later, at the time of the IEG mission, no progress
reports had been filed. A household expenditure survey (EDAM-3) was scheduled for
2008 but not launched until 2011—a significant omission because no such survey had
been conducted since 2002 (EDAM-2), complicating the attempt to monitor poverty
trends. (As far back as January 2007, when the National Initiative for Social
Development (INDS) was first launched, government had acknowledged that ―the lack of
recent reliable and comprehensive population and poverty data‖ would slow the
development of the INDS program.59)

5.12 The performance of the implementing agency (the Ministry of Finance) is rated
moderately satisfactory. The Bank’s primary interlocutor for the operation was
consistently supportive and did the best that could be expected with the limited technical
staff on hand. Financial management was sound and the main deliverable (the Action
Plan) was submitted with only a slight delay, enabling timely release of the second
tranche (thereby ensuring that the 2009 population census was completed). The project
audit for 2008 expenses was due on June 30, 2009. In the event, a single audit report was
delivered covering 2009 as well as 2008. This was dated September 27, 2010 (four
months after the completion report was released). The auditors reported that no
expenditures were made on items excluded by the grant agreement. However, the
implementing agency shared responsibility for the failure to track monitoring indicators.

5.13       Overall, Borrower performance is rated moderately unsatisfactory.

Monitoring and Evaluation
5.14 Overall, M&E quality is rated negligible. This assessment acknowledges the
special circumstances governing emergency operations. Circumstances in Djibouti were
particularly challenging, given the thinness of the technical staff engaged on M&E and
the absence of up-to-date poverty data that could serve as a baseline—the delay in
launching the household expenditure survey has already been noted. The design of M&E
included the specification of a plausible set of indicators, baselines and targets in the
program document, although the objectives were framed over ambitiously so there was

59
     International Monetary Fund 2009: 30.
                                             25


some misalignment with indicators.60 However, at the implementation phase the
specified indicators were not systematically tracked. In terms of utilization, the short span
of the operation and the lack of key data on consumption patterns made it impossible for
the M&E to influence decisions bearing on progress toward objectives.


6. Lessons
6.1     There is a trade-off between speed and targeting accuracy in the preparation of
emergency response operations. Although the staples on which taxes were lifted in
Djibouti were key components of the food basket of low-income households, there was
necessarily a significant leakage to better-off groups. On the other hand, budget support
allowed for rapid response and was appropriate to the circumstances of Djibouti. More
investment lending was not an option given that Bank commitments had already hit the
IDA allocation limit.

6.2     Emergency response can be fruitfully combined with the development of a
longer-term program. The raison d’être of the Bank is to support long-run social and
economic development and in responding to emergencies it should keep this mandate in
view. The Djibouti operation showcased this approach. Given the small size of the grant
the fiscal space created by offsetting tax exoneration was ultimately of less importance
than the opportunity to stimulate a dialogue on new approaches to safety nets. This
opening was consolidated by the simultaneous deployment of institutional development
funds aimed at strengthening the capacity to target social protection to the poor.

6.3     It is not self-evident that reducing taxes on food staples will lower their prices:
if tax reduction is to be used as an instrument there should be sufficient evidence to
demonstrate that the proceeds will be passed through to the consumer and that the
poor will be targeted. The food market in Djibouti is dominated by a small group of
importers, facilitating collusion in the setting of prices. In the event of a tax reduction,
pass through to consumers may therefore be less than expected. It would have helped if
the Bank had sought more information about market structure and the consumer demand
profile before choosing tax reduction as the preferred instrument to support.

The Global Hunger Index [GHI] is calculated by the International Food Policy Research Institute
based on three components: the proportion of all people in the country with calorie deficiency (based
on data from the Food and Agriculture Organization of United Nations) [PUN]; the prevalence of
underweight children, referring to the population aged less than five years (based on data from the
World Health Organization) [CDW]; and the proportion of children who die before the age of 5 years
(based on data from the United Nations Children’s Fund) [CM].

                                                 GHI= (PUN+CDW+CM)/3

All three index components are expressed in percentages and weighted equally. Higher GHI values
indicate more hunger. The Index varies between a minimum of zero and a maximum of 100, but these
extremes do not occur in practice. The maximum value of 100 would be reached only if all children
died before their fifth birthday, the whole population was undernourished, and all children younger
than five were underweight. The minimum value of zero would mean that a country had no
undernourished people in the population, no children younger than five who were underweight, and
no children who died before their fifth birthday.

Box B1. Excerpts from the Government’s Letter of Development Policy
         "The Government emergency program will aim to minimize the negative impact of the
          current crisis situation and to satisfy the urgent needs of the poor and vulnerable
          populations…The Government program includes the following elements: (i) strengthening
          the food aid supply in rural and urban areas; (ii) rural water supply and assistance to fishing
          development; and (iii) putting in place a targeting system for the most affected populations in
          order to improve aid transfer." (Paragraphs 24 and 25).
         "The first component of the Program aims to strengthen the food aid program in rural and
          urban areas. In the context of food crisis and drought, with their impact on nutritional health,
          the authorities’ priority is to constitute a food stock to provide for the pressing needs of the
          poorest populations living in both rural and urban areas. [Food would be channeled]
          preferably through the school feeding programs, the health centers nutrition programs, and
          the village or districts communities. This component would be executed using the “Food for
          Work? system, and implemented by institutions with the required knowhow and familiarity
          with this type of operations, such as ONARS, ADDS, WFP and some NGOs. A total amount
          of US$2 million will be allocated to this component." (Paragraph 26).
         "The second component aims to improve water supply to rural areas and strengthen the
          assistance to fishermen to encourage fishing activity development. In rural areas, water
          scarcity is a severe issue for nomadic populations and their livestock. Livestock is likely to
          disappear if no action is undertaken to fight against water scarcity. This component will help
          rehabilitate existing wells in rural areas and make them operational by equipping them with
          solar pumps, to provide water to rural populations and their cattle, as well as to for food
          production. The budget for this component, estimated at US$450,000, would allow
          rehabilitating ten wells in rural areas. This component will be implemented by the ADDS,
          given its knowledge of the rural areas and rural areas stakeholders (ONG). For the fishing
          sub-component, the objective will be to empower Djiboutian fishermen by helping them
          acquire small fishing vessels and the required equipment through in kind micro-credit
          (purchase of materials by the ADDS and total or partial reimbursement by fishermen)."
          (Paragraphs 27 and 28).
         "As regards the Program third component, the Government recognizes its limitation in
          identifying the poorest populations, as is the case in the majority of developing countries. The
          scope of the food crisis and the gravity of its impact on the neediest Djiboutians highlight this
          limitation. In particular, this limitation is evidenced by the relative incapacity of indirect
          means to reach the poorest, in comparison with a targeted and direct transfer towards the
          neediest. To address this situation, the Government is planning to make an effort to urgently
          develop an effective system of identification of the poorest, and to improve the infrastructure
          necessary for the system gradual improvement. To this end, the Government intends to
          undertake, by September 2008, the identification of at least 5,000 poorest households. Given
          the urgency of the situation, this targeting can be based on an identification system through
          Community commissions in the poorest areas for example. Obviously, such a system is far
          from being perfect, but it is relatively feasible and effective, and will be gradually improved,
          with the availability of the results of national population census and the household survey.
          The Government will develop, in collaboration with the World Bank, an action plan for the
          setting up and the future use of this system for assistance transfer to the poor." (Paragraph
          29).

Both surveys were conducted by UNICEF using the same method. The 2007 survey was carried out
between October 22 and November 16 and covered a sample of 3,635 households, representative at
the national level and for urban and rural areas of the livelihood zones defined by
USAID/FEWSNET. The 2010 survey was conducted between December 10 and 28 and included
4,275 households, representative at the national level and for urban and rural areas, using as a
sampling frame the results from the 2009 population census.
