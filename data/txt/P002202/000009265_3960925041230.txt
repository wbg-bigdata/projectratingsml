PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RWANDA
INTEGRATED PORESTRY AND LIVESTOCK PROJECT
(Credit 1039-RW)
PREFACE
This is the Proiect Completion Report (PCR) for the Integrated
Forestry and Livestock Project in Rwanda, for which Credit 1039-RW in the
amount of US$21.00 million was approved on June 5, 1980.   The loan was
closed on June 30, 1987. It was fully disbursed and the last disbursement
was on March 24, 1987.
The PCR was jointly prepared by the Agriculture Operations
Division of the Africa Regional Office (Evaluation Summary, Parts I and
III) and the Borrower (Part II).
Preparation of this PCR was started during the Bank's final
supervision mission of the project in March 1987, and is based, inter alia,
on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan, Guarantee, and Project Agreements,
supervision reports, correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and
internal Bank memoranda.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
RWANDA
INTEGRATED FORESTRY AND LIVESTOCK PROJECT
(Credit 1039-RW)
Evaluation Summary
Oblectives
1.  The basic concept behind the project was to assist the Rwandese Government
to increase the fuelwood supply base, enabling better conservation of the few
remaining national forests, to strengthen the institutions serving the forestry
sector and to establish a long-term program for 'orestry development. This was
seen as particularly acute in Rwanda, where a high dependence on wood as the
primary source of fuel goes together with extremely high population densities,
putting enormous pressure ou the available wood resource.
Implementation Experience
2. The Bank and the Rwandese Government were in full agreement on this basic
concept; the Government strongly supported project actions in this area during
implementation, and the project shows excellent results: a clear forestry policy
has been formulated; forestry services have been strengthened and have achieved
a reputation for efficiency; and physical (plantation) targets were reached well
ahead of schedule. It should be noted that the Gishwati pasture development
component, which turned to be the one controversial component, was not part of
the project during preparation and was only added at appraisal time at Government
insistence, on the reasonable argument that in order to conserve the Gishwati
natural forest, it would be necessary to get the native cattle out of the forest,
and in order to make it attractive for cattle owners tn a) so, alternative
pasture areas would have to be established.
Results
3. With hindsight, it is clear that the Gishwati pastures component suffered
from insufficient preparation.   Excellent climatic conditions existed for
establishing very productive high altitude pastures, and the technology had been
proven in neighboring Zaire; had this potential been correctly estimated, it
would have been also clear that low productivity native cattle would be unable
to capitalize on this potential, and grade cattle would be needed. Also, had the
socia. affinities in the region as well as the consequences of an artificially
high milk price been better understood, it could have been foreseen that private
interests from the outside would have come in. In the project as designed, no
milk processing equipment was thought to be required, no purchase of grade cattle
was foreseen and no cost recovery mechanisms were built in, which all turned out
to be serious issues during implementation, creating tensions between Bank and
Government. Moreover, supervision missioas during the first three years saw
progress on the Gishwati component as an immense success; they essentially
focussed on the physical implementation (rate of pasture establishment, pasture



- iv -
quality, grade cattle introduction, milk production) but failed to realize that
the implemented component was totally different from its initial design.
Sustainability
4.    In the end, project implementation was on the whole successful with an
overall ERR of 16 percent, with the forestry components much higher (28-29
percent) than the pastures component (5 percent). Even the latter has been due
mainly to the high cost of pasture establishment, the initially low stocking rate
of pastures, and milk pricing problems, which are issues that can be solved over
time. The real questions still open are those concerned with equitvs the extent
to which outside interests have benefitted from the project at the expense of
local farmers, and related cost recovery problems. An OED impact study on these
questions is strongly recommended.
Findings and Lessons Learned
5.    The lessons from this project have been the following:
(a)   Rwanda's traditions of community works programs (UMUGANDA) had been
directed by the government toward reforestation, the digging of
lateral trenches to save top soil and conserve rainwater and the
planting of hedge rows.  The forestry components of this project
were so successful because they reenforced the government's ongoing
program and commitment.
(b)   It is risky to introduce new components  into a project at a
relatively late stage, as in view of the pressures to conclude and
incomplete information, they have a high probability of failure or
of becoming controversial.
(c)   Supervision missions need to be staffed over time by persons with
different expertise, so that problems over a broader spectrum can be
identified in a timely fashion.
;d)   The problems which the Bank had to deal with during implementation
have significantly influenced the follow-up project designt much
more attention has been paid to cost recovery issues, milk pricing
and marketing policies and land tenure problems. They also have had
the benefit of initiating an open although often controversial
dialogue with Government on these issues.   Vhtile the immediate
impact of this one component was largely negative, they have
contributed to a better understanding of the underlying problems in
Rwandese society, and may well contribute to future policy changes.

Subsectors        : Forestry/Livestock.
II.  EACRM
1.    Rwanda had in 1987 a population of about 6.5  million and  an  annual per
capita  income of about  US$ 310. Agriculture is the most important sector as it
contributes about 50 % of the GDP, accounts for over 75 % of exports earnings and
supports  90 %  of the population.   The  economy  faces  a number of critical
constraints : i) population density (250 persons/km2) and annual population
growth (3.7 %) are among the highest in Africa ; ii) limited natural resources
and availability  of arable  land  ; iii)  the country's  land  locked position
(Mombasa,   the  main   sea port  is at  1,700 km  from Kigali)  entails  high
transportation costs for both imports and exports ; iv) heavy dependence on a few
agricultural  export commodities, with coffee and tea accounting for most of total
export values and thus exposing  the econorm  to great uncertainties  as world
market prices of both commodities fluctuate considerably and have in recent years
shown steep falls ; v) low urbanisation rate (less than 10 %) and weak industrial
basis, resulting in a very small domestic market.
2.    Despite  these constraints,  Rwanda has a  solid  record  of development
achievements in the post-independence period. In particular, until recently, per
capita income has increased in real terms and food and cash crops productions
kept pace with high population growth. However the remarkable achievements in
agriculture resulted mainly from extending areas under cultivation and increasing
cropping intensities, with most crops' yields stagnating or even declining. Now
that area expansion has almost reached its limits and there is not much room left
for increasing cropping intensities, there is an urgent need for developing
technologies aiming at increasing yields and extending them to farmers.
III. EOkETRY AND LTVESTOCK SUB-SECTORS
3.    Forestry plays a vital role in Rwanda s economy and farming  systems.   Wood
is a major source of energy for cooking, heating and making of bricks, tiles and
pottery.  It  is also commonly  used  as building  materials.   High population
density and growth rate coupled with scarcity of arable land have led to severe
deforestation to satisfy the needs in fuelwood and to open up more land for
cultivation.   The only  remaining natural forests of any significance are along
the Zalre-Nile divide and they are under mounting pressure  from  settlers.   From
recent estimates  they  cover about 5 %  of Rwanda s  land  area.  There is an
additional 10 % under plantations and woodlots.

areas are located.



-4-
4.    Government and  farmers are much aware of the problem and succeeded to
promote agroforestry.   Besides  providing  fuel  and  building  materials,
agroforestry improves soil moisture retention, reduces erosion and provides
organic matter to  the soil.  Also recently  improved chalcoal kilns ard
wood-burning stoves have been developed and are expected to significantly
alleviate demands for fuelwood. For these reasons recent proJections suggest
that Rwanda could meet its needs in wood for both fuel and timber by the year
2000.
5.    Livestock  has traditionally been seen in Rwanda as a symbol of wealth
and status rather than as a productive and integral part of the agricultural
system. Pressure on land led to shrinking of pastures and overgrazing.
National cattle herd has been decreasing in favor of that of goats and sheep.
About a decade ago a maJor intensification effort began with the stall-feeding
of livestock on forage crops and the manure used as organic fertilizer.
Although livestock sub-sector's contribution to G.D.P. is still minimal (3.5 %
of total G.D.P. or 7 % of the agricultural sector contribution) demands for
animal products is increasing steadily, mainly as a result of urbanization. A
major part of demand for milk has to be met by imports of powdered milk.
Government is eager to foster milk production in order to substitute for
imports.
IV.  PROJKC)
6.    The main objectives of the Project were to  strengthen  the institutions
serving the forestry subsector in implementing the first phase of a long term
program to redevelop the forestry resources of Rwanda.  A  related objective
was to develop  a high productivity cattle industry in the Gishwati area. The
Project had three main components :
a) Strengthening of the Forestry Service including : (i) its upgrading
to the level of Direction MnArale, instead of being a mere DirMct±Qn within
the Drtion Qn6rale of Agronomy  ; (ii)  the construction  of appropriate
offices ; and (iWA) the provision of staff and logistical support ;
b)  Developement  in Kigali and Butare Prefectures of : (i) 5,000 ha and
3,000 ha, respectively, of plantations to supply fuelwood, charcoal and
building poles for the urban population of Kigali and Butare ; and (ii) 1000
ha of rural woodlots to supply fuelwood and poles for the rural population ;
c)  Development in Gisenyi Prefecture of   (i) about 4,000 ha as part
of an integrated forestry and livestock development program within the
perimeter of the Gishwati Forest, including 2,000 ha of softwood plantations
for the production of saw timber and 2,000 ha of pastures of which 200 ha
would be developed as a technical support center ; and (ii) integrated crop
and livestock services in the farming zones of the seven communes surrounding
the Gishwati Forest.
Implementation was phased over a period of six years, including a
preparatory phase of one year.
V. PROJErT DESIGN AND ORGANIZATTON
7.    ProJect  identification  and  preparation  concerned  the  forestry
components only.   It was just during appraisal that Government proposed to
include the Gishwati livestock component.  This necessited a post-appraisal
mission.  Conpicuously, as it would appear throughout this report, the latter
component overwhelmed all the others.  It is worthwhile to recall its original
content as initially presented by Government. Its objective was to develop
about 80 cattle cooperatives on about 10,000 ha of pastures that would be
established after clearing the degrated forest leaving a net area of 3,000 ha



- 5 -
for pine plantation, besides the area to ba preserved under natural forest.
Each cooperative would be stocked with cattle belonging to the livestock
owners of the area who would keep the ownership of their cattle but entrust
the management and exploitation of their herd to the cooperative against a
share. Each  share would earn  a minimum  fixed rent per animal and any
additional profit  from  the   cooperative  w-uld  be  redistributed.   The
cooperatives would form a federation whiech would provide technical extensa.
*        and marketing services and would establish a slaughterhouse
and a milk processing plant.
8.    The appraisal and post-appraisal missions strived to redirect the above
proposal towards a more  intensive and  integrated approach.  However, in
retrospect  it  appears  that bot.. the Borrower and  the Bank have  far
underestimated the potential of the Gishwati forest area for livestock
enterprises.   It was anticipated in the annexes of the Staff Appraisal Report
that only five purebred Swiss Brown bulls would be introduced in the Technical
Support Center and that none of their progeny would be distributed to private
livestock owners before  the  end of the first phase project.   It  was
anticipated that milk production per lactation would increase only by 50
liters during  the  first phase  proJect.  As a result no milk processing
equipment was deemed necessary at that stage. It was thought that the small
quantities of milk which would be available for marketing could be cooled in
brooks before they are transported to the consumers in the vicinities. One
can wonder if the Government s preparation team and the Bank's appraisal
mission were fully aware of the experience in neighboring Northern Kivu in
Zaire, where exotic dairy breeds have been successfully introduced since the
50's. This would have certainly lead to aim at much higher targets.
9.    Project's physical implementation  record has been outstanding : most
targets were reached 18 months ahead of schedule and actual achievements
exceeded appraisal estimate by more than  10 %  (table  4).  Actual tree
plantations have been 12 % above appraisal target. Areas cleared and fully
developed for pastures have been above appraisal targets by 80 and  101 X  ,
respectively.  A milk  processing plant, additional civil works, supplies and
equipment which were not anticipated at appraisal and adding up to a total of
about US$ 4 million were financed. While it was anticipated at appraisal that
only local breeds would be raised during this first phase project, at
completion pure and cross exotic breeds accounted for more than half of the
total herd.  Azinual incremental milk production at project completion reached
about 1 million liters, which is the quantity anticipated at appraisal for the
year 13.
10.   It was anticipated  that for the establishment of pastures  to be
allocated to private livestock owners, the Project would finance only land
clearing and beneficiaries would contribute their labor for plowing,
plantation of grasses and making of fences. However, right the beginning of
project implementation, Project Management found that this would require too
long time and decided to do by hired labor financed by the project all the
pastures establishment works up to the point they are ready  for grazing.  The
Bank did not demur to this procedure which certainly encouraged applications
from absentee livestock owners and for allocation of large areas of pastures.
11.   An appreciating US dollar (Table 5 B), generous provisions for physical
contingencies (17 % of base costs for the overall project) and actual price
contingencies well below appraisal estimates (Table 5 C) contributed to
provide extra financing to the Project Management.



-6-
VII,   PR.VWP RlZDrT
12.   As far as physical results can be assessed at this stage, they  are very
satisfactory.   Total oilk  production  and per lactating cow are about 4 times
above appraisal estimates  (Table  4).  Tree growth  rates  for the  softwood
plantations  in  the Gishwati area are sat.isfactory.  However, because of poor
soils, the Butare fuelwood plantations have an actual mean annual increment
(MAI) estimated at only 5 to 8 m3/ha instead of the 10 m3 assumed at appraisal.
13.   On  the  institutions  and policy  aspects,  the Project has greatly
contributed to strengthen the Forestry  services.   Rwanda is among the  few
african coumtries wlho have made an explicit commitment to the protection of
the  natura]  forests.   It has also recently  promulgated  a  comprehensive
forestry law and established a forestry development fund.
14.   Overall economic rate of return (ERR) of directly productive components
estimated at completion is 16 % against  14 %  at appraisal.  The detail by
components   shows   that  re-estimated  ERRs are much higher for  forestry
components and much lower for the livestock component than that of appraisal
estimates.  These variances  resulted mainly  from different assumptions made
during the appraisal of the second phase project and deemed more realistic
than those previously made.
15.   No  financial  analysis  was  done at appraisal.   However during the
supervision of the first phase proJect and the appraisal of the second phase,
a few tests were carried out on the livestock component. They showed that in
applying  the  full set of reconmnmidation, financial returns were very high.  In
a specific case of a large pasture beneficiary who applied for a loan with the
National Development, at the produce price of RF 45/liter, the financial rate
of return was estimated at 45 %.
16.   Project's impact on environment has been beneficial for both  forestry
and livestock components since they have contributed to reduce erosion and
conserve  soils.   Despite  a f"w claims  to  the contrary  from misinformad
international ecologists and conservationists, no natural high for0st has been
destroyed as none of the areas planted with pastures and forests was covered
by anything even remotely fesembling a high forest.
17.   The most disturbing osults  of the Project relate to  the high  and
unexpected claims on Government resources.   It was anticipated at appraisal
that Government's contribution  would  amount to RF 235,5 million.   It has
actually  been  about 430 million  through end  1986.   Morever  it soared
dramatically in 1987 and 1988 with a total of about RF 487 million or 35 % of
total development budget allocated to the Ministry of Agriculture for these 2
years.   Most of  this  increase  in Government's contribution went to  the
livestock component.   This  won't be an  issue  if it was profit-earning.
Unfortunately  this  is  far from being  the case.   The  loss of  the milk
processing plant in 1987 amounted to RF 66 million.   This equals  the  total
amount spent to purchase milk with pastures beneficiaries. The result for
1988 is not yet available but the loss would certainly be in the same
magnitude.   The reasons  for  this dismal situation are : high producer price,
considerable wastages of milk before processing (about 20 % of quantities
purchased in 1987), output and prices in excess of market demand, and
inadequate equipment.   By any standards, this situation is not sustainable and
should be corrected quickly.



-7-
VIII. 
18.   Project Management Unit (P.M.U.) has been in general very  effective  in
carrying out physical tasks.   Works were carefully planned and monitored.
Lessons from experience have been alertly drawn and necessary ajustements
made.  Low  turnover of key  staff,  large and competent team of technical
assistance (5 experts during 5 years) and good cooperation between local and
expatriate   staff contributed  to  the high performance.   Examples of the
P.M.U.'s effectiveness are that unit costs of plantations and pasture
establishment  decreased   throughout  the project implementation.   Another
example is the shift in species planted in the Butare  fuelwood component.   it
was anticipated at appraisal that the main species there would be EuLalEatms
xDdi±a and E- &ligna. However when it was soon realized that these species
were unsuitable for the shallow soils which were prevalent in Butare, a quick
shift was made  to  other Eucalyptus  species which  are drought-resistant.
Ultimately the latter species accounted for more than 55 % of areas planted in
Butare prefecture.
19.   Concerning procurement, there  have been  several cases where P.M.U.
resisted to follow International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures by
splitting orders even when they could be easily grouped so as to permit bulk
procurement above  the  threshold of US$ 80,000 required for ICB. For instance
4 orders af about US$ 50,000 each were placed within a year for dithane, a
very common pesticide available on the world market.
20.    It appeared also  that  in a  few instances  the P.M.U. took too much
initiatives on its own without proper consultations with Government nor the
Bank.  This has led to breaches of the Credit Agreement, such as transfer of
project assets to private entities and advances of project resources to build
private  facilities.   Following a special audit carried out in 1986, Government
was required to reimburse about RF 54 million (over USD 600,000).
21.   Government's commitment   to  the  ProJect  ranked  from  good  to
exceptional.  Even during  the  first two years when supervision missions
reported problems of low counterpart financing, it was only because
implementation was already ahead of initial schedule.   From  1983, encouraged
by the  success of the livestock component, Government's contribution went much
above appraisal estimates (see para. 17).
22.   At times the Bank complained of excessive Government interference.   At
the beginning of proJect implementation, without economic justification and
against the reconmendations of a  study, Kibisabo was  decided  as   the
headquarters of the Gishwati sub-project, entailing an extra cost of about PF
20 million, born entirely by Government. In another case, the Bank agreed to
the construction of a primary school in the Gishwati area for the children of
the project staff.   Once completed  it was decided at a high  level of
Government to convert it into a secondary school without consulting with the
Bank.
23.    The major bone of contention bet. m.-i Government and the Bank arose from
the allocation of pastures and related issues of milk pricing and cost
recovery.   Out of the  2535 bh  fully developed at project completion, 1305 ha
or 51 % of the total have been allocated in unit areas of 30 ha or more to
small groups of less than 10 benefio:iaries very often belonging to the same
family and including high  government officials and project staff.   Reasons
given for this skewed 2/ distribution are : i) most of owners of cattle
2/ In Rwanda farms of 2 ha and more represent only about 15 % of the total
number.

have to pay the cattle tax (RF 250/head) ; and ii) traditional livestock
owners were risk adverse and would not readily adopt intensive dairy farming
technique.   However there  is no bard fact to support these contentions since
in 1980 there were about 12,030 cows officially registered in the seven
cowumnes surrounding the forest and the technical support center was meant to
demonstrate the benefits of intensive dairying.
24.    The skewed distribution of pastures  is thought to have prevented or
delayed reaching adequate and swift decisions on cost recovery and milk
pricing as proJect staff and officials who have to submit proposals or take
decisions were somewhat caught in a situation of conflict of interest. Initial
proposal for setting user charges on pastures was well articulated in that it
was recognized that pastures represent earning entities whose benefits accrue
to a limited number of beneficiaries. It aimed at recovering only the direct
costs of pasture development costs and the IDA service charge. This would
amount to RF 5,000/ha from year 10, after a grace period of 5 years and a
building  phase of another 5-year period.  The Bank  found  this proposal
unsufficient but an initiative in the right direction. However in the first
montract passed with beneficiaries, the charge at full development was reduced
to  RF 3,000/ha.   In a further step, even before any charge is collected, on a
basis of a ministerial decree passed in January 1988 and dealing with rental
rates of domanial lands, beneficiaries argued that they should not pay more
than RF 1,300/ha. In fact, this decree does not require any payment on such
pastures, in view of their remote location.
25.   Concerning milk pricing,  despite  the loss  experienced by  the milk
processing plant, ths producer price was set A RF 45 (about US$ 0.50) per
liter throughout the first phase project implementation. This rigid approach
contrasts with the decision taken by OVAPAM 3/ to lower the price to RF 35 in
an  attempt to  cover  its costs.   It is also worthwhile to point out that in
Kenya where intensive dairy farming has been widely taken up by  small farmers,
the producer price of milk amunts to less than US$ 0.20 equivalent/liter.
26.   However the  involvement of  influential and better-off. people has also
had a few positive aspects.  It must be candidly  admitted that without their
participation, the high potential of the Gishwati area for the dairy industry
would have been much slowly exploited.   For instance all the ten  livestock
owners who  recorded more than 70 1/pasture of 30 ha/day in 1987 were all among
this class of beneficiaries.  Also it has certainly  been  stimulating  for the
P.M.U.  staff to have as  clients high officials who had a say in their
promotion and reassignment.
IX.   B  PE?RMANM
27.   The last-minute addition  of  the  livestock  component took  the Bank
somewhat unprepared.  The underestimation of the potential of the livestock
enterprises led to overlook  the pressure the pastures wc-ld  trigger from
private interests in a counury like Rwanda where such highlands are among the
",last opportunities to acquire new lands. It is conspicuous that the Cred-it
Agreement does not contain any covenant aiming at recovering part or all of
the costs of pasture development, dealing with milk pricing or controlling
land  allocation.   There  was a provision in the Staff Appraisal Report (paras
3.24 and 4.07) that the membership criteria and operating procedures for the
3/ OVAPAM is a parastatal operating in a semi-arid zone with pastoralists.

pastures beneficiaries associations would be submitted to IDA for approval
during the first year of project implementation. However this condition has
been omitted  in  the Credit Agreement.  These shortcomings contributed to
strain the dialogue between the Bank and the Borrower when these issues
surfaced as there was no agreed legal basis.
28.    Supervision was adequate and timely (Table  8 B)  with a total of  13
missions, 4 of which were carried out before credit effectiveness. Turnover
of mission leadership has been low and the mix of specilization adequate.
Most of the mission actually fulfilled a technical assistance function.
29.   When  in  1985 major charjes  were made  in  the  leadership and  the
composition  of the missions,  "he PMU complained of the role of personalities
and strained relationships.       sure, in the Bank, as  in any other human
group, there are different n,   ilities.  However 1985 marks the end of major
physical works --for which t1"   , 10. deserved praise-- and the emergence of
management and  social issuE    *'iKh were much more complex and diffuse.  It
should also be admitted that the B-rJ.k failed to be alert in detecting issues
and discussing  them with Gove.±rment.  For instance it is surprising that it
took more than three years after the beginning of pastures' allocation to
private livestock owners before a Bank staff, visiting the project for the
first time, raised the issue of skewed distribution which was certainly known
to the frequent supervision missions and the several Bank managers who visited
the sub-project. Government construed this disclosure as a premeditated and
malicious move.  From  that time  this and other related issues became highly
emotional.
X.  PROJECT USTAINAILITY
30.   The benefits of the  forestry components are  likely  sustainable
plantations address genuine needs, their maintenance are relative inexpensive
and their costs are likely to be recovered from users.
31.   The sustainability  of the livestock component looks uncertain.  However
when seen in perspective, there are reasons to be optimistic.   Bases for this
are :
i)    Gishwati area has unquestionably the best coomparative advantage
for dairy industry in Rwanda : the best exotic breeds easily acclimatize
there, highly productive forage species thrive there throughout the year, and,
in a radius of less than 10 km there is a capacity of collecting 20,000 liters
of milk/day.
ii) Government of Rwanda has a solid record of sound management and
has recently expressed a firm commitment to reforming the public sector.
iii) With the importation from Zimbabwe of a thousand of Frisian
heifers presently underway, most pastures will be soon stocked with grade cows
; this would make it much easier than before to have the price of milk in line
with market demand and beneficiaries accept cost sharing.
32.    In conclusion,  all  aspects considered, this project can be considered
as successful. The Gishwati livestock component evolved in directions not
fully  apprehended at appraisal.   The resulting  issues are delicate but
challenging and frequently encountered in  the development process.   At this
stage it is difficult to fully assess the project impact. It would certainly
be a good case for an OED impact study to be carried out in 5 or 7 years.

Sir:
With reference to your letter of February 2, 1990, I am pleased to
let you have the comments of the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Forestry
on the preliminary Project Completion Report of the Integrated Forestry and
Livestock Project (Cr. 1039-RW), a copy of which you enclosed with the above-
mentioned letter.
Faithfully yours,

INTEGRATED FORESTRY AND LIVESTOCK PROJECT
COMMENTS ON THE END-OF-PHASE REPORT
1.          Looking at livestock development in eastern ZaEre, there was no
economic justification for even thinking it was possible to develoF pastures
with the same potential in the Gishwati area, while at the same time raising
Ankol6 cattle there.
How could anyone fail to realize that there would be a rush to ensure
the largest possible return from pastures developed at groat expense? When the
Bank realized that it had underestimated the results in this area, it should have
seen to it that certain projections were corrected or at least that the milk
processing facilities were designed to be compatible with the already obvious
trend. Instead, the Bank just let things take their course, leaving ths way open
to uncontrolled investment.
2.          The use of the Gishwati pastures by people not residing in the forest
is a difficult problem to deal with, whether the people in question are small
farmers or government officials, because absenteeism is inevitable, regardlass
of category of beneficiary.
3.          In a country like Rwanda, where land is a scarce resource, the
appraisal report was unrealistic for several reasons when it proposed allocating
pasture developed under the supervision of government officials to small farmers
alone:
the government officials in the area in question have their parents
and the rest of their families, generally small farming households.
Since the pastures were allocated to livestock owners, hence to the
small farmers, the goal was accomplished. But in cases where the
cattle belonged to their families, the government officials were also
involved. And since they were the ones who were best informed it
was quite natural for them to be designated by their relatives as
group chairmen. We should point out here that groups formed in this
manner are currently the most viable.
the government officials and a few other enlightened people for the
most part represented the driving force in getting the livestock
owners to accept the Project's proposals.   At the outset, the
livestock owners were extremely reluctant to participate in Project
activities. This phenomenon is quite common: there had already been
cases of similar reluctance on the part of stockraisers:
particularly at the start of the OVAPAM Project in Mutara.
to have excluded government officials from the outset would not have
been realistic either, because such discrimination would have had
to have been accompanied by some mechanism that would have made it
possible to check appetites aroused by the prospects of profitable
pasture exploitation. But even if such a mechanism did exist, it
did not work, nor could it have worked, given the interests involved



- 16 -
and the respective influence of the socio-occupational classes
represented.
4.          The positions taken by the World Bank led Wo the politicization of
the Gishwati issue, and the situation was needlessly inflamed by the arrogance
of certain Bank specialists.   In retrospect, it is clear that the various
personality conflicts assumed major significance and that problems of a technical
or economic nature were relegated to secondary importance. Does the Bank really
have such a precise idea of how many government officials are pasture
beneficiaries that it dares to claim that pasture allocation was so skewed that
it "prevented or delayed reaching adequate and swift decisions on cost recovery
and milk pricing?"
There is reason to believe that the Bank was mistak.n in its target.
Otherwise, how can one explain the fact that OVAPAM set the price of milk at RF
35 per liter while the Integrated Forestry and Livestock Project managed to get
the price set at RF 30 per liter, without any Government intervention? We should
also add that the productivity of the herd being used at that -time made it
impossible to achieve the producer price reduction recommended by the Bank.
5.          The Project Completion Report talks about relatively high injections
of government funds. In the context of the development and protection of areas
cleared by potato growers, the Government did not have all that much choice
particularly after the withdrawal of World Bank financing.

. Fuelwood : valued at current price of charcoal, adJusted for
transport and processing costs
. Saw wood : valued from pine wood price imported from Kenya
. Milk and Heat : bases are missing in the SAR and Technical Annexes,
but most probably have been valued at market prices.
2)    Ckmigt4on : Rates have been computed in the process of appraising the
second phase project :
. Foreign exchange  shadow rate of US$ 1 = RF 99
. Unskilled labor  valued at RF 74 per day
. Saw wood : valued from market price, adJusted downward, to take
account of the futur excess supply of pine wood.
. Fuel wood : valued on briquet equivalent value
. Milk : falued from import parity prices of skimmed milk powder and
butter oil with a premium of 30 % for fresh milk. Gives a value of RF 18.8/1
of unprocessed milk.
M Meat : valaed at export parity of RF 98/kg (live weight)).
