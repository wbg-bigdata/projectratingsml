SUBJECT: Project Completion Report on Zaire
Lulua Agricultural Development Project
(Credit 1540-ZR/IFAD Loan 160-ZR')
Attached is the Project Completion Report on Zaire - Lulua Agricultural
Development Project (Credit 1540-ZR/IFAD Loan 160-ZR) prepared by the Africa
Regional Office with Part II contributed by the Borrower.
The project aimed to increase production by small farmers, thereby inter alia
reducing pressures to clear the remaining forest in the area. While a small trial extension
component aimed at women proved successful, overall implementation results were
generally less than planned, because of inadequate management, constrained local funding
and an over-optimistic design which failed to recognize the role of improved infrastructure
and cash cropping incentives. The economic rate of return at completion is estimated to
be low or negative. Accordingly, the project outcome is rated as unsatisfactory and
sustainability as uncertain.
The comprehensive PCR identifies some useful lessons: the importance of an
adequate road network, the potential of extension aimed at women producers and the
need for effective monitoring and evaluation.
No audit is planned.

LULUA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1540-ZR; IFAD LOAN 160-ZR)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Lulua Agricultural Development Project
in Zaire, for which a credit in the amount of SDR 12.6 million (US$12.5 million equivalent) was
approved on January 8, 1985. The credit became effective on February 4, 1986, and was closed on
June 30, 1992, after a two year extension; the last disbursement took place on September 15, 1992,
and the undisbursed balance of SDR 6.5 million (US$6.5 million equivalent) was cancelled on
September 30, 1992. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) co-financed the
project with a loan in the amount of SDR 6.6 million (US$6.5 million equivalent), of which SDR 3.7
million (US$4.1 million equivalent) had been disbursed at the time of the IDA credit closing.
The PCR was prepared by the Agriculture Operations Division of the South-Central and
Indian Ocean Department, Africa Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I and III). The
Borrower has submitted a draft PCR which was taken into account in preparing this report. A copy
of the PCR was sent to the Borrower, whose comments are presented in Part II. Comments were
also received from IFAD, which are reflected in the PCR.
Preparation of this PCR was started during the final supervision mission of the project carried
out by the Bank and IFAD in Zaire in June 1992, and is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal
Report, the Development Credit Agreement, supervision reports, correspondences between the Bank
and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda.

LULUA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1540-ZR; IFAD LOAN 160-ZR)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Background
1.    In the last decade, Government's agricultural strategy for the country was based on the
following three principles: (i) to make the country self-sufficient in food crops; (ii) to increase the
production of crops used as raw materials by local industries; and (iii) to increase export crop
production. To achieve these objectives Government (i) focussed on cabinet level coordination of
agricultural policy and reinforcement of the capacity of the Department of Agriculture and Rural
Development (DADR) to implement projects more effectively, and (ii) gave priority to local crop
production to substitute for imports. The Lulua Agricultural Development Project was one of the
foodcrop production projects supported by IDA in the savannah zones of Zaire to increase production
of basic foodstuffs. The project was implemented from 1986 through 1992.
Project Objectives
2.    The project aimed at increasing foodcrop production of 80,000 farm families through
diffusion of technical information by the extension service, availability of inputs, transport
infrastructure, and marketing services. The project was to be implemented over a five year period
and included the following components: (i) reorientation, training, and logistic support for the
agricultural extension service; (ii) a field trials program; (iii) production of improved seed and
planting material; (iv) provision of agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilizers, insecticides, tools, improved
seeds); (v) credit for trucks to be used in agricultural marketing operations; (vi) rehabilitation and
maintenance of roads, bridges, and ferries; and (vii) establishment of a Project Unit responsible for
project implementation.
Project Implementation
3.    The credit became effective on February 4, 1986 (a delay of almost nine months). Inability
of project staff to effect timely procurement of goods and insufficient Government contributions
seriously delayed the implementation of most project components. Efforts were made by project
management to procure large enough quantities of fuel, lubricants and fertilizers, to allow for the
lengthy processing time of purchase and delivery. Two components in particular were affected: (i)
the infrastructure program for which heavy equipment did not arrive until the third year of project
execution; and (ii) late arrival of trucks for agricultural marketing operations because of only last
minute arrangements between the project unit and the Development Finance Enterprise (SOFIDE),
the financial institution in charge of handling the required loans.



- iv -
4.     The applied research program was carried out poorly initially. Most technological packages
were not developed until the close of the project. Seed production was initially carried out at high
cost on two project seed farms. One farm was transferred to the applied research program; activities
on the second farm were rationalized and additional seed production was carried out by contract
farmers.
5.     The extension service, which used a modified Training and Visit (T&V) system, functioned
well after initial delays. Reactions were very positive to women's activities initiated by the project,
with emphasis on linking agriculture with nutrition, hygiene and home economics.
6.     Due to the lack of private sector interest in the delivery of agricultural implements to farmers
and in marketing of agricultural produce, the project tried to fill these gaps albeit with little success.
Project performance in road rehabilitation and construction was also below expectations. The
Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Service suffered from confusion about its functions and loss of
information following the pillaging of project assets and files in October 1991, which prevented it
from collecting basic project data in a satisfactory manner.
7.     Actual project costs are estimated at US$13.2 million or 60 percent of appraisal estimate
(US$19.9 million). In US$ terms 1/, the IDA credit was only 70 percent utilized (US$8.8 million
actual versus US$12.5 million estimated) and the IFAD loan was only 63 percent utilized (US$4.1
million actual versus US$6.5 million estimated). Government only contributed 10 percent of the
amount originally planned (US$0.3 million actual versus US$2.9 million estimated).
Project Results
8.     Project objectives were only partially met and the economic rate of return is likely to be
unsatisfactory. Despite delays and procedural difficulties encountered, the extension service was able
to contact about 76,000 farm families. Improved cultivation practices were introduced and based on
field visit observations, the project had a positive impact on agricultural productivity albeit less than
estimated. Adoption rates for technical packages in 1991 were estimated at more than 80% for maize
and 60% for cassava. Some 2,711 demonstration plots were established. (1,021 for maize; 686 for
cassava; 590 for cowpeas; and 414 for groundnuts). Results of project activities in infrastructure and
monitoring and evaluation, however, were short of expectations. Only five bridges were built out
of 16 planned, and 6,082 km of road were maintained accounting for 70% of planned activities. Basic
project data were not gathered properly by the M&E Service which benefitted from training and
reorganization only late in the project period. Reliable production data are therefore not available.
Marketing of agricultural inputs and implements by the project was not successful, because farmers
were reluctant to use cash inputs.
Sustainability
9.     The economic and political environment of Zaire in 1992 makes sustainability of project
benefits doubtful. The project suffered substantial losses of material and equipment during the civil
disturbances in October 1991, from which it has not yet recovered. While the extension service has
been effective in bringing about improvements in farming practices, a number of technologies are in
1/     On the basis of historical exchange rates.

the trial phase awaiting confirmation before full diffusion. If extension activities created by the
project cannot be maintained, an erosion of gains will take place. It is unlikely that in the present
situation, Government will be able to afford the services needed to sustain project initiated activities.
However, it must be stated that farmers are highly motivated and would continue to react positively.
At credit closing, Government agreed to transfer the extension and infrastructure activities to the
National Extension Service and the National Roads Maintenance Agency. The former is presently
receiving financial support through the Pilot Extension Project (IDA Cr. 2096-ZR).
Lessons Learned
10.    The main lessons learned or confirmed during project implementation and the preparation of
the PCR are summarized below:
(a)    The main bottleneck for sustained agricultural growth in the project area was lack of
market access because of the dilapidated rural road network. As a result, trading
costs were too high and traders were not interested in selling inputs or marketing
produce. Project management efforts to overcome these obstacles, by undertaking
road rehabilitation and by direct input purchase and produce marketing, were
insufficient due to implementation delays and ultimately not sustainable financially
or institutionally after credit closing. Rural road improvement programs have now
shifted to the national level, with emphasis on institutional strengthening and
increased support from local entities.
(b)    Lacking market access, farmers were mainly interested in improving food production
for local consumption. The project's main achievement was to build up an extension
service that adjusted itself to farmers' desires, hence the high adoption rates for
maize and cassava, the basic foodstaples in the region. The transfer of this effective
extension service to the national extension service at credit closing is an essential
condition for sustaining project results.
(c)    An effective monitoring and evaluation unit, with clear objectives, is instrumental to
successful management and supervision of a project. Without pertinent information,
it is impossible to make timely decisions affecting project implementation.
(d)    An extension program  for women that focusses on their productive agricultural
activities, and integrates it with nutrition, hygiene and economics has more chance
of meaningful impact than traditional women's programs that just focus on home-
economics. In this project, it was responsible for effectively introducing soybean into
the farming system.
(e)    Contract growers can be used effectively for seed production, provided they receive
sufficient technical assistance.

LULUA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1540-ZR; IFAD LOAN 160-ZR)
PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE
1.    Project Identity
Project Name:       Lulua Agricultural Development Project
Credit No.:         1540 ZR
RVP Unit:           Africa
Country:            Republic of Zaire
Sector:             Agriculture
Sub-sector:         Foodcrops
2.    Background
2.1   In 1979, about 75% of the population of Zaire made their livelihood in agriculture. Three
to four million small-scale farmers produced food crops such as cassava, maize, plantains and rice,
providing about 60% of agricultural production. The remainder came from large plantations that
produced - for export - palm oil, coffee, rubber, and cocoa. The political upheavals of the 1960s,
the nationalization policy in the mid-1970s and the neglect of the country's infrastructure resulted in
a decline in the output of both large-scale and small-scale producers. As a result, exports declined
and imports increased in order to satisfy the needs of the ever-growing population.
2.1   In 1981-82, the Government of Zaire advanced a strategy for the agricultural sector in its
Agricultural Recovery Plan based on three objectives: (i) to make the country self-sufficient in food
crops; (ii) to increase the production of crops used as raw materials by local industries; and (iii) to
increase export crop production. For the short- and medium-term, the priorities were foodcrop
development through the recovery of smallholder production and rehabilitation and maintenance of
existing production capacity.
3.    Project Objectives and Description
3.1    The project aimed at increasing foodcrop production in the project area which comprised of
23 collectivities in the Lulua and Kananga sub-regions of the Kasai Oriental Province, covering a total
surface area of about 29,400 sq. km with an estimated population of 1.1 million people and 133,000
farming families. Some 80,000 farm families were expected to benefit from the project through the
dissemination of technical information by the extension service, availability of inputs, transport
infrastructure and marketing services.



3.2    The project, as agreed at negotiations, included the following components:
(a)    reorganization, training, and logistical support for the agricultural extension service;
(b)    a field trials program;
(c)    production of improved seeds and planting materials;
(d)    provision of agricultural inputs (e.g. fertilizers, insecticides, tools, improved seeds);
(e)    provision of credit for trucks to be used in agricultural marketing operations;
(f)    rehabilitation and maintenance of roads, bridges and ferries; and
(g)    establishment of a Project Unit responsible for project implementation.
4.     Project Design and Organization
4.1    The project was designed using the experience of the Kasai Oriental Maize Project (PMKO):
(i) a project unit under the aegis of the Department for Agricultural and Rural Development (DADR),
was responsible for the implementation of most of the components; (ii) the National Roads
Maintenance Agency (OR) was made responsible for the infrastructure component; (iii) credit for
truck operators was channeled through the intermediary of the Development Finance Enterprise
(SOFIDE); and (iv) the marketing of inputs by the project was to be carried out in association with
the private sector in order to assure continuity after project completion. Unlike PMKO, there was
no provision in the project of a credit program for farmers, given the poor results of this component
under the PMKO project. The credit agreement did not set a specific date for an agreement between
SOFIDE and Government for the implementation of the credit for trucks components, which led to
significant delays.
4.2    The management of the project was given a considerable degree of administrative and
financial autonomy, with the Project Director reporting directly to the Secretary General of DADR.
This degree of autonomy was necessary given the inadequate regional administrative structure and
the fact that the strengthening of services of the DADR was still in progress. While a committee was
established at the regional level to follow project implementation and make observations and
recommendations, this had no impact on the project, although its chairman, the Regional Inspector
of DADR, maintained at all times a keen working relationship with the project.
4.3    The Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) identified no unusual risks (para. 7.10 of the SAR). The
general risks associated with all projects in Zaire were (i) Government intervention in the economy
(e.g. price setting, barriers to inter-regional trade); (ii) shortage of qualified local managerial staff;
(iii) insufficient counterpart funding; and (iv) delays in the adoption of improved production
techniques because of the existing economic environment (subsistence production systems). During
implementation, it became apparent that the risks associated with insufficient counterpart funding had
been underestimated. In addition, the SAR did not identify procurement delays as a major factor
affecting project implementation.



- 3 -
4.4    The major shortcomings in project design were: (i) the reliance on imported inputs such as
chemical fertilizers and pesticides in order to increase yields, when experience in other projects in
Zaire had already shown that farmers would have difficulty obtaining fertilizer after project
completion; and (ii) optimistic assumption on the time needed to rehabilitate the rural road network
and the impact this would have on the opening up of new markets.
5.     Project Implementation
A. General
5.1    Credit Erfectiveness. The credit was declared effective on February 4, 1986, after a delay
of almost nine months. This delay was primarily due to slow selection of senior project staff and
procedural problems related to the establishment of the project unit.
5.2    Project Costs and Financing. Actual project costs are estimated at US$13.2 million as
opposed to US$21.9 million estimated at appraisal, i.e. 60 percent. IDA provided a credit of
US$12.5 million, of which US$8.8 million was utilized (70 percent) and IFAD co-financed with a
loan of US$6.5 million, of which US$4.1 million was utilized (63 percent) at the time of the IDA
credit closing. 2/ Government was to contribute US$2.9 million, but contributed only US$0.3
million (10 percent). The root cause for the much lower than estimated project costs was insufficient
counterpart funding, which affected procurement and thus overall project implementation.
5.3    Procurement. Long delays were experienced because project staff was unfamiliar with IDA
procurement procedures, communications between project staff and Government were affected by the
long distance between project headquarters and Kinshasa; counterpart funding was grossly
insufficient; and IDA wanted to bring the liaison offices in Kinshasa for several agricultural
operations under one roof, which met with opposition from other projects, and led to delays in
establishing the Lulua liaison office (the main link between the remote project area, and the central
Government and major suppliers). To minimize the impact of delayed procurement on project
implementation, the project sought to purchase large quantities to satisfy the needs for several years
at once (fertilizer, fuels and lubricants, etc.). Machinery for the roads' program arrived only in
1989, severely delaying the start of this component; motorcycles for the extension staff were not
delivered until mid-1988.
5.4    Disbursements.  Because of procurement delays and less than estimated demand for
agricultural implements, and consultants services, actual disbursements were only about 48 percent
of estimates in SDR terms and 70 percent in US$ terms. The final disbursement took place on
September 30, 1992, at which time the undisbursed balance of SDR 6.51 million (US$6.45 million
equivalent) was cancelled.
5.5   IFAD disbursements were suspended from August 28 to November 4, 1987, and from
January 10 to November 12, 1992, following arrears in debt service by the Government. The final
disbursement has not yet taken place on the IFAD Loan and the information presented in Table 3,
Part III, is therefore incomplete.

B. Individual Project Components
Reorganization, Training and Logistical Support for the Agricultural Extension Service
5.6    The extension service was reorganized along the basic principles of the Training and Visit
System (T&V), with two modifications: (i) the principle of the contact farmer was dropped in favor
of group training and follow-up with the most receptive farmers; and (ii) the extension agents were
put in charge of distribution of inputs. Initially, the effectiveness of the extension service was
undermined by a lack of transportation, and insufficient extension agents and inputs. Towards the
end of the project, the effectiveness of the service was undermined because of the reluctance on the
part of Government to maintain the purchasing power of salaries and supplements in the context of
galloping inflation.
5.7   Initial extension messages focussed on seeds, soil preparation and maintenance, and storage
and conservation of maize. Delays in the applied research component, however, affected the
availability of suitable extension messages. With the focus of research on green manure and selected
crops, this situation changed towards the end of the project. In 1990, the project initiated women's
activities with emphasis on linking agriculture with nutrition, hygiene and home economics. Six
women extension workers were trained in these areas, who carried out training programs specifically
for women farmers.
5.8    Project design called for staff training using district trainers and the establishment of a
training center. The conversion of abandoned Government buildings into a training center, was ill-
conceived, and slowly realized. It was never used for this purpose, and the project unit has prepared
a proposal to convert it into a young farmers' training center J/. The project recognized that by
more strictly applying the T&V system, there was a reduced need for this type of facility. Fifteen
Subject Matter Specialists/Trainers were appointed and activities were harmonized with the Pilot
Extension Project (Cr. 2096-ZR), which was approved in February 1990.
Field Trials
5.9    The knowledge of the project area with its considerable size and ecological variations was not
detailed enough, and therefore complete technological packages to suit each environment were not
available at the start of the project. A cadre of local staff was entirely responsible for the agricultural
program. Their work suffered from isolation and a lack of exposure to higher levels of agricultural
research. External training had been foreseen, but this was not realized until late in the project.
Thus, the research effort undertaken in the period from 1986 to 1988 suffered. Too many research
themes were pursued, the systems of trials was too complex and the extension messages were not
matched by supporting research. This led to a successful reorientation of research by setting
priorities based on needs identified by extension agents and the Monitoring and Evaluation Service.
5.10   The project had envisaged the use of improved inputs (fertilizer, insecticides and seed
produced on the project's seed farm), in order to carry out the technological recommendations of the
extension service. However, project staff realized that the reliable provision of sufficient quantities
of these inputs in a timely manner could not be guaranteed during implementation, and expected this
i/    It is unclear what the buildings are used for at the present time.

to become an even bigger problem in the post-project period. In addition, farmers were reluctant to
pay for inputs, when a large part of their production was for autoconsumption. Hence, research in
the later years of the project placed special emphasis on the use of leguminous plants as a source of
green manure to reduce the reliance on imported chemical fertilizers.
Production of Improved Seeds and Planting Materials
5.11   Dependence on the project's seed farm for farmers' annual seed requirements had to be
abandoned when it became evident that the seed farms could not produce sufficient quantities of low
cost seeds. A small seed farm was transferred to the applied research program and activities at the
main seed farm at Salushimba were rationalized. The project instead instituted seed production
through contract seed farmers, and encouraged farmers to select and save their seed requirements
from each harvest. Using this approach, substantial improvements have been achieved in the
production of seeds towards the end of the project period.
Provision of Agricultural Inputs
5.12   The delivery of agricultural tools to farmers through traders did not materialize. There was
no private sector interest in this field. Thus project staff was responsible for this activity throughout
project implementation. Initially project staff sold tools directly to farmers, but this was not
successful as recoveries from field staff became difficult to effect. Finally, the project, while
continuing to procure all tools, gave sales responsibility to selected farmers and obtained close to a
100% recovery rate.
5.13   Fertilizer was in short supply until 1991. The lack of fertilizer undermined the effectiveness
of the extension service as technical packages required the use of chemical inputs. Fertilizer
distribution remained mostly the responsibility of project staff. There was substantial private sector
interest in the distribution of improved seeds and fertilizers, while they were distributed by the project
below cost against IDA recommendations. In 1987, forty percent of improved seeds and fertilizers
were resold to civil servants and local traders. No information is available for later years.
Provision of Credit for Trucks
5.14   This component was substantially delayed, because project staff was not convinced that
SOFIDE should be used as the credit agency. As a result, the agreement between SOFIDE and
Government was not concluded until late in the project. Ten trucks were procured and delivered to
traders in the final year of the project. In spite of the fact that the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development made a serious effort to ensure that the trucks were purchased for use in the project
area, there is evidence that the truck operators are not honoring the conditions of their contract.
However, all truck loans have been repaid.
Rehabilitation and maintenance of Roads, Bridges and Ferries
5.15   The OR transferred staff to the project early on and a technical assistant was hired to oversee
the roads component.  Unfortunately, the road rehabilitation program  could not be properly
implemented because of the considerable delay in procuring heavy machinery (almost three years).
Once equipped, the mechanical rehabilitation and construction of roads progressed well. The
technical assistant's contract was shortened in light of the delays in obtaining the equipment. Initial



-6 -
emphasis was placed on manual routine maintenance using the old system of employing village gangs.
Given the extremely poor state of the roads, the vastness of the network, and the lack of counterpart
funding, the impact of using labor-intensive road maintenance techniques was minimal.
Establishment of the Project Unit
5.16   The establishment of the project unit encountered serious delays. Furthermore, the liaison
office in Kinshasa, which was meant to facilitate procurement and logistics, was not established until
1987. Project management received mixed reviews from IDA supervision missions. Initially, it was
found to be adequate, but later financial management issues began to emerge (allowances for
ineligible activities, theft of gasoline and appropriation of project goods by local authorities), with
little follow-up from DADR.
6.    Project Results
6.1    The project failed to meet its objective of increasing foodcrop production in the project area,
primarily because of severe implementation delays. By 1991, however, progress had been made and
the extension service was successful in reaching about 76,000 farmers with improved technology, i.e.
95% of target (Table 4, Part III). Food production has undoubtedly increased through the adoption
of basic extension messages, albeit much less than estimated. A large number of farmers have
adopted the practice of crop rotation on savannah soils. Maize was the main season crop, while
cassava and beans were planted in the second rainy season. The use of savannah soils for crop
production reduced the need for farmers to clear forest areas which could only be found at
considerable distance from the communities. The awareness of the need for fertilizer in the cropping
system is well established, and farmers recognize the high costs of obtaining this commodity.
Therefore, there is a keen interest in the use of the green manure.
6.2    The results of trials comparing different forms of legume use for improving soil fertility
versus fertilizer application, have demonstrated that alley cropping of maize with Cassia floribunda
gives an acceptable yield (over 2,000 kg/ha; only marginally less than obtained with fertilizer). The
use of Mucuna and Stylosanthes species as a cover crop or in rotation with maize has also given
promising results. The project collaborated in research on the use of legumes to improve soil
conditions with national and international research institutions.
6.3    Activities for women were originally not provided for in the project. However, a trial
initiative was highly successful and some 350 women received training in nutrition from special
extension workers (para. 5.7), resulting in the introduction of high protein soybean as a feature of
their diet. There is a strong demand from the communities for enlarging this program. While the
extension service has been effective in bringing about improvements in farming practices, a number
of technologies are in the trial phase awaiting confirmation before full dissemination.
6.4    As shown in Table 4, the transport infrastructure maintenance component implemented only
a small portion of its objectives, and therefore the aim of substantially improving market access was
not accomplished. This was due essentially to the late start of the roads rehabilitation component
coupled with long delays in delivering the trucks for transportation of inputs and produce.



6.5    The project's overall institutional impact was marginal. Project accounting and internal
controls suffered from lack of experienced and qualified staff, and high staff turnover. In the case
of the M & E Service, basic project data was not collected until 1988 (with the help of PMKO staff)
and was not collected on a regular basis until after 1990. It appears that management did not fully
understand the purpose of such a unit. Efforts to correct this, which included overseas training and
a local seminar sponsored by the Bank, resulted in a better appreciation by management level staff.
However, the action was too late to have a major impact. Staff changes, training and reorganization
of the unit were introduced late in the project, with only a limited impact. As a result, the unit did
not collect the data upon which monitoring and evaluation activities were to be based, and for most
of the project life there was no meaningful data collection.
7.     Economic Rate of Return
7.1    The economic rate of return was estimated at 30% at appraisal. Because of inadequate data
collection by the M & E Service and the destruction of project files in October 1991, it is not possible
to re-estimate the economic rate of return. Moreover, the estimated rate of return in the SAR was
based on faulty assumptions of farm size and production mix (farms turned out to be much smaller,
with production geared towards self-sufficiency), making it impossible to estimate a new, comparable,
rate of return. Given the impact of serious implementation delays and the erosion of project
activities following cessation of donor support, the economic rate of return is likely to be
unsatisfactory and possibly even negative.
8.     Project Sustainability
8.1    Sustainability of project benefits are doubtful. The project suffered losses of material and
equipment during the civil disturbances in October 1991, from which it has not yet recovered. At
credit closing, major activities including extension and infrastructure maintenance were transferred
to national services in charge of such activities (i.e. SNV and OR). This streamlined the services
concerned and contributed to reducing the impact of inadequate and irregular provision of
Government counterpart funding for individual projects. It is, however, uncertain, in the present
economic and political environment, whether Government will be able to afford the services needed
to sustain project initiated activities. If the extension activities set in place by the project cannot be
maintained, most of the project gains will be lost.
9.     Bank Performance
9.1    The Bank fell short in several areas. First, project design showed serious shortcomings (para.
4.4). Second, it was unable to secure sufficient counterpart funding, despite repeated efforts. Third,
supervision was inadequate, not in frequency but in expertise. Supervision missions paid increasing
attention to administrative and financial matters, and to agronomic issues but fell short in training and
management assistance, in procurement supervision and in guiding the M & E Service, until late in
the project. Fear of a repeat of the serious financial abuses experienced in the PMKO and the Ituri
projects was the primary reason.



-8-
10.   Borrower Performance
10.1   There was good cooperation at the technical level between the project and other Government
agencies. There were, however, delays in establishing the agreements between Government and
SOFIDE, which led to procurement and thus implementation delays. Most importantly, the
Government provided only a fraction of counterpart funding needed, causing serious delays in project
implementation.
10.2   Government failed to follow-up forcefully on the abuses encountered during implementation
(allowances for ineligible activities, theft of gasoline and appropriation of project goods by local
authorities (para. 5.16)). In addition, the Government did not stop parallel extension activities in the
project region, contrary to the Development Credit Agreement. However, the impact of these
parallel extension activities was minor.
11.   Project Relationships
11.1   For the most part the relationship between Bank and Government was good. However the
project team frequently expressed its frustrations with IDA's insistence on strictly adhering to
procurement guidelines. The experience of abuse in other projects in Zaire (e.g. PMKO and
Northeast Rural Development Project when granted such exceptions) had led supervision missions
to exercise greater caution under this project.
12.   Consulting Services
12.1   A long-term consultant for administration and finance provided training to project staff and
made a useful contribution to project implementation.  The roads consultant was generally
underemployed while waiting for the much delayed heavy machinery to arrive, and his contract was
shortened. Short term consultants were satisfactorily employed. The team of auditors was replaced
because they had developed the new accounting system and a conflict of interest was feared. The
replacement team performed satisfactorily.
13.   Project Documentation and Data
13.1   Lack of data because of poor data collection by the Monitoring and Evaluation Service and
the destruction of project property during the disturbances in October 1991, make it impossible to
do a quantitative analysis of project achievements.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ZAIRE
LULUA AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(CREDIT 1540 ZR; IFAD LOAN 160-ZR)
PART II: PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE 4/
The project completion report prepared by the Government of Zaire in June 1992 provides
a concise presentation of the views of Zaire regarding the future of this Project.
A transitional phase was planned, during which the priority measures identified on page 58 5/
of the Government's project completion report are to be carried out, involving various project
components.
The importance of the actions embarked on is such that it is essential that support for them
be continued until they are taken over by the target groups; otherwise the effects of the project will
very quickly become lost.
In reading the World Bank report, the following points must be kept in mind:
(a)    The component providing support to local seed producers was started very late.
Since seed is an important aspect of the technology package, it is particularly useful
to continue support in this area.
(b)    The report refers to the results achieved, i.e. 76,000 farm families reached. What
this really means is that a start has been made with these 76,000 families; it should
not be thought that all these families have mastered the agricultural extension
messages and have adopted them on a permanent basis.
The action started among these families must therefore be continued until they reach
the point of really adopting the messages and applying them automatically. This is
confirmed in paragraph 7 (Sustainability) of the World Bank's Project Completion
Report.
4/    Comments received from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Office
of the Secretary General for Rural Development, Republic of Zaire.
5E     Reference made to Government's project completion report.



- 10 -
(c)    The technical package adoption rates of 80% (maize) and 60% (cassava) mentioned
in the report refer to the areas that were reached by the Project and that benefitted
from supplies of fertilizer and improved seed.
These rates will decline unless support is provided and maintained.
(d)    Road maintenance is an ongoing activity; it is a vital support component, in that it
is an integral part of the overall support structure for extension, marketing and
production. It would therefore be pointless to continue the extension activities
without incorporating the road maintenance component.
(e)    Transportation is also an important area of support for extension and production. In
view of this, the remaining credit for trucks should be utilized.
(f)    The report states that the events that occurred in October 1991 (pillaging) have cast
doubt on the sustainability of the gains deriving from the Project.
We believe that, apart from project documents, nothing was stolen that was of such
strategic importance that it would jeopardize the sustainability of these gains. Project
momentum can easily be made up as long as the necessary resources can continue to
be made available and strict organizational and management measures are put into
place. The situation is admittedly serious but not hopeless.
(g)    It should also be pointed out that the private sector appears, through lack of interest,
not to be responding positively to the marketing of agricultural inputs; hence it is
essential that efforts in this key area be continued by Government agencies, in this
case by the Lulua Agricultural Development Project, until this interest can be
successfully aroused through improvements in road infrastructure, the local tax
system and the market for these products.
(h)    Extension in the area of green manure is no small achievement in terms of the
evaluation of the Project, given the fact that this type of fertilizer has the edge in
terms of cost, availability and the environment. This component is undoubtedly
worthy of support.
(i)    Observations concerning pages 12 and 13 of the World Bank report
*      With reference to the transportation of agricultural produce, the report's
estimate for one year, i.e. 510 tons of maize, compared to the figure for the
actual results for the entire project phase, i.e. 10,896 tons of maize, indicates
a huge discrepancy between the estimates, which are much lower, and the
actual results, which are very much higher.
It should be pointed out that the two trucks assigned to transport the produce
are the same ones used to distribute inputs, which makes collection estimates
difficult.



- it -
*     With reference to roads maintenance, the report speaks of 8,074 km
earmarked for manual maintenance, as compared to the 5,670 km actually
carried out.
In actual fact, road maintenance was only planned for 2,240 km; 1,770 km
of road have been regularly maintained over the three year period, 1989-91.
Manual road maintenance is done with the assistance of mechanical
equipment in the case of urgent repairs. No mechanized maintenance is
performed until after some manual work is done and this will be continued
on a permanent basis.
The estimated and actual figures given on page 17 and 18 of the World Bank
report seem to be new. 6/
*     The Government's contribution seems to be somewhat minimized by a failure
to take into account the value of the premises which the Government made
available to the Project. "The value of these premises was estimated by an
expert from the consulting firm of "SOGECOZA" at Z 69,481,172.53, i.e.
an amount of US$ 1,292,245.89, at the 1985 exchange rate of US$1 = Z
49.87.
These data were provided by the Project Unit.
