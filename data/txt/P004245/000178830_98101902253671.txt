FOR OFFICIAl, '!S ONLY
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRE'SIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO MALAYSIA
FOR THE SECOND KUALA LUMPUR URBAN TRANSPCORT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Malaysia for the equivalent of US$26 million to help finance an urban
transport project in metropolitan Kuala Lumpur.  The loan will have a term
of 25 years, including a grace period of 5 years, with interest at 8-1/2
percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report (No. 653-MA) was circulated to the
F2ecutive Directors in March 1975.  The population of Malaysia in 1974
was about 12 million, growing at a rate of 2.7 percent per annum.   Detailed
country data are shown in Annex I.
3.        With a per capita GNP of US$490 (1973), Malaysia is one of the
most prosperous developing countries in Soutlheast Asia.  The economy has main-
tained fairly high rates of real growth, with the GNP growing at an average
of about 6 percent a year during the last decade. However, GNP real growth
was only about 1 percent in 1975 as a result of the world depression and
falling commodity prices. Because of changes in the terms of trade, real
national income growth slowed down even more or became negative in 1975
after having achieved 6 lercent in 1974 and an exceptionally high rate of
17 percent in 1973. The balance of payments still showed a surplus in 1975,
with the value of both exports and imports at a lower level. Malaysia's
external reserves were about US$1.49 billion at the end of September 1975,
which equals about five months of net imports at present levels.
4.        Rubber continues to be the main pillar of the Mialaysian economy,
contributing almost 30 percent of export earnings and about 15 percent of GDP,
but continuous progress Is being made in reducing the dependence on rubber
exports through diversifIcation of exports to timber, tin, palm oil and
petroleum products. In L973 Malaysia's production of crude petroleum was
about 90,000 barrels per day. In a few years, production is expected to
increase about four-fold. In 1973 Malaysia became a net exporter of petroleum
products and, as production increases, petroleum will soon become an important
foreign exchange earner. Substantial reserves of natural gas are also avail-
able and by the early 19130's Malaysia is expected to start exporting signific-
ant quantities of liquefied natural gas, further strengthening the country's
balance of payments position.
5.        Malaysia's conaervative fiscal and monetary management has con-
siderably enhanced the country's financial standing. Public sector revenues
have been growing rapidlyt, mainly as a result of vigorous taxation efforts,
and the ratio of total government revenue to GNP is now about 24 percent.
Conservative financial policies are also reflected in the relatively low

- 2 -
level of external public debt and the very low ratio of debt service pay-
ments to exports.
6.        Recently, inflation has been a concern.    After a decade of remark-
able price stability (with consumer prices rising on an average of only 1 per-
cent per annum), domestic prices began to show a noticeable upward trend in
1973.  Average consumer prices in 1972 were 3.2 percent higher than in 1971
but they increased 10.5 percent in 1973. In 1974 prices rose another 18 per-
cent, but prices rises slowed down in 1975 to about 6 percent. Price prcs-
sures have been the result principally of movements in world prices. However,
Malaysia has not been adversely affected by the higher price of petroleum. On
the contrary, Malaysia should benefit from it in the long term.
7.        During the last several years, the Government's long-term planning
has concentrated on reducing the economic disparity between the Mtalays, who
account for a little over half the population, and non-Malays of whom about
70 percent are Chinese. Over the next 20 years the Government aims to era-
dicate poverty and to restructure society so that present identification of
race with economic activity will be eliminated. The basic outlines of the
New Economic Policy, announced in June 1971, allow for continued growth
for each of the principal ethnic groups while enlarging economic opportuni-
ties for Malays.
8.        Both the Second Malaysia Plan (1971-75) and the Third Malaysia
Plan (1976-80), which is expected to be reviewed by Parliament in April
1976, follow closely New Economic Policy objectives and indicate the Govern-
ment's determination to step up the development effort in the public sector.
During the Second Mtalaysia Plan, total public sector development expenditures
amounted to about US$3.9 billion of which 50 percent was financed by net
domestic borowing and 16 percent by net foreign borrowing. The balance
was financed largely by public savings. The Bank has provided about 32
percent of foreign project loan commitments; loans fom the Asian Development
Bank and bilateral aid, mainly from the United Kingdom, other Commonwealth
countries, the Federal Republic of Germany and Japan, provided the rest. For
the next five years disbursements of over US$1.5 billion of medium- and
long-term loans from abroad are likely to be required to permit the level of
public investment planned.
9.        To support this inflow, new foreign loan commitments of approxi-
mately US$2.7 billion will be required over the five year period. Project
loans from multilateral sources, IBRD and ADB, are not expected to decrease;
bilateral assistance from sources such as Japan and market borrowing are
likely to be higher. The Government has also made initial contacts with
a number of OPEC member countries and the first aid commitments have already
been obtained.
10.       Malaysia's development program will continue to require resources
in excess of the foreign capital which will become available for financing
the import component of foreign-finance development projects. The Bank plans,
therefore, to cover a portion of local costs in agriculture and in other
sectors where the foreign exchange component of projects is small.

11.       Debt service obligations at present are about 2.5 percent of ex-
ports of goods and non-factor services and are estimated to rise to over
5 percent during the late 1970s. This level is still well within Malaysia's
debt servicing capacity. The Bank's share in Malaysia's debt service pay-
ments is 22 percent and is expected to be about 23 percent by the end of
1978.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MALAYSIA
12.       The Bank has made 30 loans to Malaysia for projects in education-,
population, agriculture, forestry, industrial finance, power, water supply,
telecommunications, ports, railways, roads and urban transport. Although
in a few cases disbursements were slow, the execution of these projects has
generally been satisfactory. As of December 31, 1975, the loans to
Malaysia held by the Bank; amounted to US$557.0 million. In addition, the
Bank made a loan in 1965 to the Public Utilities Board, Singapore (Loan
405-MA), guaranteed by Malaysia, to finance the Johore River Project. The
amount held by the Bank under that loan as of December 31, 1975 was US$4.6
million. Eleven loans are fully disbursed. Annex II contains a summary
statement of Bank loans and IFC investments, and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.
13.       Bank assistance to Malaysia is in line with the country's New
Economic Policy, which aims at eliminating imbalances in income distribu-
tion. The Bank will, therefore, continue to support Malaysia's agricultural
programs, including land development and settlement, and improvement of
production and employment: in existing low income farming areas, which are
effective means to reduce unemployment and income imbalances. The Bank will
also continue to assist i:n the financing of infrastructure development includ-
ing urban development and housing for urban low income groups. The Bank has
helped the Government to prepare projects either in the course of its lending
operations or through its sector work. The Bank has also helped to strengthen
public agencies responsitble for carrying out important parts of Malaysia's
investment program. The Bank will continue this policy, which will be reflect-
ed in the loans to be presented to the Executive Directors in the next year or
so. These loans would be for projects involving agricultural extension,
irrigation and rural development, including assistance to rubber smallholders
and new land settlement, development finance companies, education, highway
transport and other infrastructure development.
14.       At present the Bank is also assisting in the preparation of
the Third Malaysia Plan (11976-80), both in the preparation of sector
programs and in the review of overall economic objectives and policies.
15.       IFC has been active in Malaysia since 1963 and has made five
investments totaling US$8.69 million (Annex II). The total commitments
under those investments held by IFC as of December 31, 1975, amounted to
US$1.8 million. IEC is at present considering an investment in a textile
project.

PART III - THE URBAN SECTOR IN MALAYSIA
16.       The urban proportion of the population, 37 percent in 1970, is
smaller than would be expected for a country with such a relatively high
income level as Malaysia. This is because the rural areas are the leading
income-producing areas, with rubber, palm oil and tin playing a dominant
role. Much of the country's urban growth is rural-led, with many of the
smaller towns functioning as local service-centers for the rural popula-
tion. Larger cities also serve as administrative centers for the large-scale
development efforts and are able to attract private industry. While the
smallest and the largest towns are growing rapidly, medium-sized towns are
declining in importance.
17.       The urban development policy aims at providing increased employ-
ment opportunities and higher incomes to the Malay population, which so
far has been largely rural and low income, and migration of Malays from rural
to urban areas is encouraged. Regional development programs for lagging re-
gions, especially in the East Coast region where 70 percent of the population
is Malay, include the development of new towns. Malaysia is one of the few
countries which is beginning to form a spatial policy for national develop-
ment; UNDP is providing technical assistance.
The Nation's Capital
18.       By 1973, the population of the Kuala Lumpur conurbation (860,000)
was growing at a rate of 3.7 percent annually, about 1 percentage point above
the national average. The average monthly household income was about US$395
in 1975, about 20 percent above the average urban income and about 90 percent
above the national average. The Government is attempting to shift new invest-
ments to other regions in order to curb the growth rate of the Kuala Lumpur
area, but it is doubtful whether it will succeed, since administration,
services and manufacturing are heavily concentrated in the area and are
growing faster than other sectors in Malaysia. Some 55 percent of the popu-
lation in the metropolitan area are Chinese and 25 percent Malays; the remain-
ing 20 percent consist mainly of people of Indian origin; these proportions
are typical for urban areas in Malaysia.
19.       In February 1974, Kuala Lumpur became a Federal Territory under
the direct control of the Federal Government and its area was expanded
from 36 to 94 sq. miles. The Prime Minister now appoints the Mayor who
heads the city administration, usually referred to as City Hall. City Hall
lacks power-and staff; in particular, it cannot carry out planning or
enforce zoning, although it is formally responsible for these tasks. A
Federal Territory Land Executive Committee was established to deal with
land matters; it is chaired by the Chief Secretary to the Government but
has no technical planning staff.
Housing and Infrastructure
20.       A large portion of Kuala Lumpur's   population cannot afford satis-
factory housing and do not have access to adequate infrastructure services.



-5-
While almost the whole population of Kuala Lumpur is served by a water supply
system, only 25 percent of the population is at present served by a water-borne
sewerage system, a percentage to be increased to 45 by 1981 as a result of a
proposed Bank-financed sewerage project to be presented to the Executive
Directors at the same meeting as this project. Thirty percent squat on public
and private land, as do a similarly high proportion of small-sized businesses.
An inadequate public transport system severely restricts the access to employ-
ment opportunities for the poor.
21.       The Federal Urban Development Authority (UDA) was established as a
statutory body in 1971. With UNDP assistance, UDA is undertaking a study of
infrastructure service levels and of land uses and land onwership in the
Federal Territory, and is preparing a development strategy to help its in-
vestment decisions. It is viewed as having a key role in the implemen-
tation of the NEP; it has been charged with a major responsibility for in-
creasing Malay ownership and employment in the modern urban sector.
Transport in Kuala Lumpur
22.       The transport system in Kuala Lumpur has become inefficient.
It is exceptional in its high rate of private vehicle ownership and use,
and suffers from severe traffic congestion. About 60 percent of all motor-
rized trips are made by private transport in Kuala Lumpur, compared to 36
percent in Singapore, 26 percent in Bangkok and 10 percent in Istanbul. There
has in the past been little Government effort to improve public transport.
Service standards are low and have been deteriorating. Public transport
services are provided by private bus comapnies licensed by the Government.
23.       To solve the transport problem in Metropolitan Kuala Lumpur, the
Government, in consultat-Lon with the Bank, has decided to introduce strong
policy measures that will encourage public transport, restrain the use of
private cars and substant:ially reduce the road investments otherwise needed.
Such policy measures and actions are part of the proposed project, which also
includes the first stage of a low-cost investment program for roads, road
improvements, and traffic engineering and control.
24.       The responsibility for the transport sector in the Federal Terri-
tory is divided as follows: the Highway Planning and Public Transport Unit
(HP & PTU) of the Ministry of Works and Transport (MWT) is responsible for
overall transport planning and coordination and for public transport; the
Public Works Department (PWD) of the MWT for the design and construction of
specific major arterial and ring roads; City hall for the design and con-
struction of all other roads, for traffic engineering and control, and for
all road maintenance; and the Traffic Police (under the Ministry of Home
Affairs), jointly with the. City Hall, for the enforcement of traffic regu-
lations. This arrangement is satisfactory; specific actions to strengthen
the above institutions are being taken under the proposed project.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
25.       The proposed project was originally identified through an Urban
Transport Policy and Planning Study for Metropolitan Kuala Lumpur, carried
out by consultants, partly financed through Loan 851-MA. Consultants' work
on feasibility studies and engineering is financed through Loan 931-MA.
Much of the preparatory work for these studies was carried out under the
UNDP Klang Valley Regional Planning and Development Study, for which the
Bank acted as Executing Agency.
26.       The proposed project is the first urban transport project ap-
praised since publication in May 1975 of the Bank's Sector Policy Paper
on Urban Transport, and conforms to the recommendations of the paper. Its
main purpose is to make more efficient use of existing and planned transport
facilities in the Kuala Lumpur area. Public transport services will be
improved, while the use of private cars will be restrained. The use of
High Occupancy Vehicles (HOVs) will be encouraged and that of Low Occupancy
Vehicles (LOVs) will be discouraged. The proportion of total motorized person
trips by bus in the peak periods is expected to be raised by 10 percent by
1980 and by a further 5 percent by 1985. Average private car and taxi oc-,-
cupancy is expected to be raised by about 10 percent by 1980 and by a further
5 percent by 1985. The project will also integrate into the metropolitan road
network Federal Highways I and II, which are being improved and constructed
through two previous Bank loans, 851-MA and 931-MA.
27.       Although the project is essentially an urban transport project, it
also contains important components and initiatives in other urban sectors to
provide jobs and services to the urban poor. It initiates programs for
squatter area upgrading and the development of low cost urban settlements and
it will, concurrently provide for an orderly and socially acceptable resettle-
ment of squatter households and businesses being displaced through the various
road construction projects as well as through the sewerage works carried out
under the proposed Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project. Squatter households have
in the past been moved on an individual basis into subsidized high-cost
public housing, usually far away both from the work places of the household
members and from other households in the squatter community. Squatter
businesses have been relocated on a similar ad hoc basis, resulting in the
break-up of the mini-economies that are typical for squatter communities,
with well developed backward and forward economic linkages. Loss of jobs
and income has followed. The proposed project will provide for the relocation
of all displaced families and businesses by only a short distame (an average
of 2 miles). About 950 households will be relocated. Their average income
is about the same as the national average and only slightly more than half
of the average for Kuala Lumpur. An additional 400 plots will be developed
for new settlers. The majority of these new settlers will have incomes below
the 20th percentile on the income distribution curve for Kuala Lumpur.
28.       Relocated businesses will be moved according to a program aimed at
minimizing the disruption of their activities. The sites and services at
the new location have been designed to eliminate the constraints that have
prevented these businesses from implementing the expansion plans many of



-.7-
them have. The lack of tenure, the size of the plots, and insufficient
public services, have in the past been major constraints. Plots will also
be provided for new buSinesses. The long-term employment generation effect
of the project will therefore be substantial (about 1,000 jobs).
29.        The sites and services components incorporate key elements of the
new urban development and housing policy being considered by the Government,
such as efficient site planning, appropriate design standards, self-help
housing construction, full cost recovery, and employment generation.to be
applied in Kuala Lumpur and other urban areas in Malaysia. The cost per
housing unit is about a third of the cost of City Hall's traditional public
housing schemes.
30.        To achieve the above objectives, the project includes the fol-
lowing policy measures and actions:
(a)  raising of bus fares;
(b) phasing-out of an existing bus seat tax;
(c)  introduction of minibus services,
(d) introduction of measures to give preferential treatment for
HOVs, including, as necessary, intersection and access
priorities and exclusive lanes and roads;
(e) raising of parking charges;
(f) introduction of an area road pricing scheme for the
central city area; and
(g) modification of existing building regulations in
favor of low cost building design standards.
Implementation of the policy measures is well under way (see paras. 31-33).
31.        Phyiscal works to be implemented under the project are:
(a) New Roads and Road Improvements: Included are about 7 miles
of new roads and 10 miles of road improvements (Map 1). All
of the new capacity is allocated for the exclusive or priority
use of HOVs. These roads will:
(i)   link Federal Highways I and II with the urban road
network and with each other;
(ii)   complete a Middle Ring Road around the city center;
(iii)   provide bus stops and other HOV facilities along
Federal Highways I and II; and



- 8 -
(iv) improve an Inner RinR Road which by 1980 will become
the cordon of the expanded road pricing area.
(b) Traffic Engineering and Control: Included are (Map 2):
(i) improvement of 12 major intersections;
(ii) implementation of a traffic circulation plan for the
central area, including the provision of traffic signals
and master control equipment for an area traffic control
system capable of giving traffic priorities to HOVs;
(iii) implementation of a 4-year program of HOV priority
schemes to provide traffic priorities for HOVs along
designated routes;
(iv) implementation of the area road pricing scheme, including
(1) signs, (2) gantry entrances, (3) sales booths,
and (4) information material; and
(v) equipment and training for traffic monitoring.
(c) Sites and Services Included are:
(i) the first stage of the development of a low cost settlement
on and around abandoned tin mines in the Salak South area,
south of the city center, an area with high development
potential whose accessibility is being improved through the
Second Highway Project (see Maps 3 and 4):
(1) about 50 acres of residential sites and ser-vices 'for
750 households;
(2)  about 27 acres of industrial sites and services for
120 small businesses;
(3) about 2 acres of commercial sites and services for
20 small businesses;
(4) about 25 acres of agricultural sites and services
for small scale vegetable and pig farming (18
businesses);
(5) upgrading of infrastructure services for about 2,100
squatter households;
(6) provision of community facilities: one primary
school, one health clinic, and two community halls;
and
(7) equipment and training for monitoring and evaluation;



- 9 -
(ii) sites and services for about 600 squatter households that
will be displaced through the construction of sewage treat-
ment plants under the Kuala Lumpur. Sewerage Project; and
(iii)   the establishment of a Sites and Services Unit in UDA, and
recurrent expenditures for the Unit through 1978.
32.       Technical assistance to be provided under the project includes the
following:
(a)  consultants' services for (i) feasibility and engineering
studies for the proposed project; (ii) supervision of the
implementaticin of the physical project components;
(iii) a study of water resource development and preparation
of an urban development project in Kuantan, a secondary city
on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia; and (iv) the prepar-
ation of a national sites and services program for a newly
established fHousing Department in the Ministry of Housing and
New Villages, with emphasis on an integrated development of
small-scale industries and low cost housing;
(b)  four advisers, for a period of two years, to a newly
established Traffic Management Department (TMD) in City
Hall;
(c)  two advisers, for a period of two years, to the HP &
PTU; and
(d)  training of the staff of the Housing Department, TMD,
and HP & PTU, with detailed training programs to be
prepared by the consultants and advisers referred to
above in cooperation with the agencies.
Implementation of Policy Measures
33.        Improving Public Transport Services:    To improve the financial
situation of the bus cempanies, thereby enabling them to upgrade and
expand their services, the Government has recently allowed the bus fares
to be increased, from NM4 to MV5 per mile. The Government will also phase
out the bus seat tax over four years, 1976-79, for old vehicles (Section
3.06 of the draft Loan Agreement). The seat tax on new buses and mini-buses
will be abolished entirely during 1976. This is expected to induce an im-
mediate expansion of the bus fleet. The structure and levels of bus and
mini-buses fares will be reviewed annually and adjusted as necessary to permit
the services to be provided on a commercial basis, (Section 3.11 of the draft
Loan Agreement), and licenses to operate public transport vehicles will be
issued in sufficient number to enable the project objectives to be achieved
(Section 3.12 of the draft Loan Agreement).



- 10 -
34.       In March 1975, the Government decided to introduce mini-bus services
in the Kuala Lumpur area to complement existing taxi and bus services. The
mini>-buses provide a high frequency and high quality transport service with
good area coverage and with efficient utilization of road space.    About 1,000
license applications have been received to operate a total of about 2,200
mini-buses.    About 100 mini-buses were in operation by December 31, 1975 and
about 400 additional mini-buses are to be introduced by mid-1976, covering 28
routes with an average length of 2 miles. The fare has been, initially fixed
at M040 (USi16) per trip which is about twice the price of bus travel and
abou't 25 percent of the price of taxi travel.
35.       Buses, mini-buses, and, in certain cases, taxis and cars with 4
people or more (HOVs), will be given intesection and access priorities, and/
or exclusive lanes, at times and places where they would otherwi-se be delayed
thrdugh congestion caused by LOVs. Delays to LOVs will be accepted as a
matter of policy and will help achieve the objective of getting a shift to
more economical forms of transport. A network of "Designated HOV Routes"
covering all majot arterials and the city center has been defined and will
be developed through traffic engineering measures and minor civil works
that are part of the project. (Section 3.08 of the draft Loan Agreement
and Section 2.10 of the draft Project Agreement).
36.       Restraining Uneconomic Private Car Use:    The policy of not
meeting the full demand for road space by LOVs will result in excessive
LOV traffic congestion in the centr-al area, reflecting the underpricing
of ioad space there. The price of LOV travel in the center has therefore
to Se increased. In November 1975 the Government raised the parking.
charges. However, higher parking charges will not discourage the use of
road space by through, or non-parking, traffic which at present accounts
for about half of the traffic in the city center. Area road pricing will
therefore be in-troduced by July 1, 1:977 (Section 2.07 of the draft Project
Agr'eement). LOVs entering 'the central area during peak hours will be
charged M$2 (US$0.80) per day or'M$40 (US$16) for a monthly license. The
revenues will accrue to City-Hall. The priced zone will initially cover
about 1 sq mile and will be expand'ed by 1980 (see Map 2). The necessary
legislation was passed by the Parliament in November'1975. A similar
pricing scheme was introduced in Singapore in June 1975 and is being closely
followed by the Bank through its research program.
Enforcement of Policy Measures
37.       To effectively imp'lement the policy measures, steps are being taken
to strengthen the enforcement of traffic regulations and public transport
service standards. In June 1975, City Hall introduced equipment and person-
nel to tow away broken down and illegally parked vehicles. A Traffic Warden
Force was established by City'Hall in June 1975. Recruitment of additional
vehicle safety enforcement officers is under way in the Road Transport Depart-
ment of the MWT and public transport service inspectors will be introduced.

Implementation of Physical Components
38.       The MIT will be the eXecuting agency with its Highway Planning and
Public Tradisport Unit, responsible for coordinating, monitoring and reporting,
on project implementation. The Public Works Department (PWD) of the same
Ministry wili be responsible for implementing All new roads and road improve-
ments except for the Inriner Ring Road improvement which will be done by City
Hall. City Hall will also bd responsible for Traffic Engineering and Control
as well as for Sites and Services;   The latter component will be implemented
by the Urban Developmenat Authority on behalf of City Hall Consultants will be
employed to assist in Lmplenlenting the project (Section 3.02(a) of the draft
Loan Agreement and Section 2.02 of the dtaft Project Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
39.       Total project cost is estimated at US$72 million, of which land
acquisition costs are IJS$6.4 million. The estimated costs include physical
contingencies of 12 percent, and price contingencies of 10 percent in 1976,
and 8 percent thereafter for equipment, and for civil works 12 percent in
1976, and 10 percent thereafter.
40.       The proposed Bank loan of US$26 millidn would be made to the
Government and would finance 36 percent of total project cost, equal to the
foreign exchange cost. The loan would be repaid over 25 years, including a
grace period of 5 years. The remainder of project costs would be financed by
Government funds. The proceeds of the Bank loan and Government funds would be
for direct Government e!xpenditures (US$63.9 million) consisting of transport
components and technical assistance, a grant to City Hall (US$3.5 million) to
cover off-plot infrastructure services and community facilities, a loan to
City Hall (US$4.0 million) on the same terms as the Bank loan to cover plot
and house development, and a grant to UDA (US$0.6 million) for the establish-
ment of a sites and services unit. A spread of 3.5 percent is recommended
between the 8.5 percent interest charged on the Government loan to City Hall
and the 12 percent City Hall would charge project beneficiaries, in order to
cover administrative costs and help generate a surplus.    The cash surplus will
go into a revolving fund to be used exclusively for financing of future sites
and services projects (Section 3.13 of the draft Loan Agreement.
Cost Recovery
41.       Road user charges in. the Kuala Lumpur area represent twice the
amount spent on road construction, maintenance and traffic control, and
will fullv cover the project costs. The daily license fee under the area
road pricLng scheme is estimated to exceed the congestion costs that low-
occupancy vehicles impose on other travelers. The cost of the Sites and
Services component of the project i.e. the cost of land, earth works, roads,
on-plot infrastructure, core housing and materials, financed through the
US$4.0 million loan to City Hall will be recovered by plot sales; cost of
off-plot wvater supply anld sewerage facilities will be recovered through
water and sewerage charges.

Procurement and Disbursement
42.       Contracts for all new roads.and -road 'improvements and for all equip-
ment for t raffic engineerihg and control, with an estimated to.tal value-of
US$.42 million (64 percent of.total project cost excluding land acquisition),
will be let under international competitive bidding in acc.ordance with Bank
guidelines. Contracts fot abo,ut US$3 million will be for equipment and the
remainder for civil works.   A margin of.preference of 15 percent or the
applicable customs duties, whichever is lower, will be applied to domestic
bidders offering domestically manufactured goods.    Contractor.s will be allo'wed
to bid either for contract packages with an average cost of about.US$7 million
or for small individual contracts.   Foreign contractors will be'encouraged
to use local subcontractors. It is expec:ted tha-t contracts for about US$20
million will-be awarded to for,eign co.ntracto.rs.  These contracts ar-e for (a)
complex bridge structures and-.works r.equiring ex.tensive management skills in
which local experience is limited, and (b) traffic signalling.and control
equipment-not manufactured locally.
43.       Civil works contracts for traffic engi-neering, sites and services,
and squatter area upgrading, with an estimated total value of US$13.5 million
(21% of total project c,ost excluding land acquisition), will be awarded
after local competitive hbidding in accordance with Bank guidelines.   The
civil works contracts for tr-a-ffic-engineering (US$6.5 million) will cover the
first four years of a continuing prog-ram of improvements. They are -relatively
small, ranging in size from US$20,000 to US$50,oo0 and in scattered locations,
and'would not attract foreign contractors.    The civil works contrac.ts  for
sites and services and for squatter area upgrading are also individually
small and are unlikely tto.att:rac-t'fo-reign contractor interest. Given the
urgency of squatter relocation, the first contracts for sites and services
are -being let under local .procedures which hav.e been reviewed by the Bank
and-are acceptable.   Contracts fo,r,consulting services (US:$9.5 million)
will be awarded on term-s and c.ond:itions agceptable to the Bank. One civil
works contract for ab.out. US$0..1 million for sites and services has been
a,,warded, with s.ome re.troactive Ban-k financing to -be provided. Retroactive
finatncing amoun.ting to about US$0.7 millio,n will also be provided for feasi-
bili,ty and engineering studies of the proposed p:roject.
44.       Disbursements will be made against:    (a) 35 percent.of the cost
of civil works for new roads,, road improvement and traffic engineering and
con.trol; (b) 100 percent of the c-.i.f. cost of equipment and materials if
imported; 100 percen.t of the ex-factory cost if locally manufactured and 70
percent if imported but procured locally (c) 45 percent of the cost for civil
works for sites and services and squatter area upgrading, and of the expendi-
tur.es for the Sites and Services -Unit in UDA-; and (d) 50 percen.t of the cost
for technical assistance.
Economic Evaluati,on, Monitoring, and Risks
45.       The economic ra-te of r,eturn of the project as a whole is estimated-
at about 30 percent; 31 percen.t for the transport component, the benefits
of which are assumed to consist of savings in vehicle operating cost and



- 13 -
user time, and 23 percent for the sites and services and squatter area up-
grading components, the benefits of which are assumed to consist of rentals
and increased land values. The transport component accounts for 76 percent
and the sites and services component for 10 percent of total project cost;
technical assistance accounts for the remaining 14 percent. It has been
estimated that as a result of the policy decisions and the greater cost-
efficiency of the transport system achieved through the project, future
transport investments required through 1990 are being reduced from an esti-
mated M$700 million to about M$250 million.
46.       Quantitative targets to meet project objectives have been established
for 1980 and 1985. Monitoring of the achievement of the objectives for
both transport and sites and services will be carried out by the respective
institutions. Key performance indicators have been defined for traffic
improvement - non-bus/bus travel modal split, average private car and taxi
occupancy, bus travel time, and passenger waiting time at bus stops - and for
sites and services - cost of plot and core house, income of purchasers,
employment generation, and income growth and distribution (Schedule 5 of the
draft Loan Agreement).
47.       The policies and actions related to urban transport to be undertaken
as part of this project are similar in some respects to those pioneered in
Singapore, but are otherwise untried in the LDCs. Some elements, for example
area road pricing, have not been tried in developed countries. There are
political risks: for eKample, the measures might be unpopular, and unenforce-
able, if LOV traffic is restrained without corresponding improvement in the
existing inadequate public transport system. To minimize risks of this kind,
project implementation has been carefully planned, with particular attention
being given to the early improvement of public transport services.
48.       There is also a risk that the prices charged under the area road
pricing scheme might not be consistent with the objective of maximizing
the "output" of the roadl system: a price set too low would have no appre-
ciable effect, and a price set too high could result in too much traffic
being forced out of the central area to the detriment of traffic outside
and of trade inside. The Government will monitor traffic developments care-
fully, with Bank assistance, and modify as necessary bus frequencies and
routings, schedules and fares, HOV priorities, charges under the area road
pricing scheme and parking charges.
Future Developments
49.       The full benefits of the project, as well as of projects in other
sectors, including the proposed Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project, cannot be
realized without improved intersectoral metropolitan planning and budgeting.
Due to the complexity and political sensitivity of the issues involved, it
is expected that their resolution will take some time. The Government
has initiated a review of the planning issues in Kuala Lumpur with the
assistance of a consultant, financed by UNDP. A program to continue this
work and to prepare development plans for the Federal Territory has been
adopted, (Section 4.02 of the draft Loan Agreement). It includes the follow-
ing main steps:



- 14 -
(a)  The Government will, together with City Hall, by July 1,
1976 establish an inter-governmental task force to carry
out development policy analysis, broad spatial planning,
capital programming and project reviews in the Federal
Territory. The task force will be provided with the
necessary technical staff, and with technical assistance,
which the Government is expected to obtain through UNDP.
(b)  The Government will by September 1, 1976, in consultation
with the Bank, prepare a detailed two-year work program
for the task force, including terms of reference fbr the
technical assistance.
(c) The Government will prepare recommendations on an
institutional framework and processes suitable over the
longer term for the continuation of the task force s work
and for decision-making. One proposal which will be
further investigated is to transform the task force into
a permanent technical unit attached to the Land Executive
Committee and to expand the powers of the Committee to
inclu'de policy making, broad spatial planning, capital
programming and project sanctioning for the Federal
Territory.
(d) The task force, on the long-term institutional framework
referred to in (c), will by January 1, 1578 prepare a ten-
year spatial development plan and a five-year capital budget
for the Federal Territory.
In implementating the above program, particular attention will be paid
to the need to integrate the work with that of a strengthened city
administration. There would, however, be a shift away from the present
emphasis on static and restrictive land use planning, or zoning, towards
a more comprehensive and continuous planning process that would focus
on development policies, socio-economic objectives, and resource con-
straints. The development plans would be closely linked to the national
five-year plans, and the first development plan would be prepared in time for
the Government's Mid-term Review of the Third Malaysia Plan, in mid-1978.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION
Loan No. 672     Second Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project; US$13.0
Million Loan of May 20, 1970; Effective Date: August 20-
1970; Closing Date: May 31, 1977
Loan No. 885     Third Jengka Triangle Land Settlement Project:
US$25.0 Million Loan of March 30, 1973; Effective Date:
June 22, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The projects, and a first project already completed, consist
of the clearing of forest, the planting of 62,000 acres of oil palms and
35,000 acres of rubber and the settlement of 10,000 families in the Jengka
Triangle (State of Pahang). The Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA),
responsible for the execution of the project, operates efficiently, keeping
high standards of planting and maintenance.  Under Jengka II village develop-
ment community facilities and housing is proceeding satisfactorily although
slightly behind appraisal schedule. 2,718 housing units have been completed
(target 2,965). 2,036 are now occupied by settlers and 20,360 acres have
been allocated to settlers. Completion of Scheme 9 mill has been delayed
because of prolonged tender procedures and delays in delivery of equipment.
The mill is now expected to become operational in early 1976. Resultant
insufficient mill capacity has caused temporary harvest cut-backs and
reduced earnings to settlers. FELDA is diverting ffb wherever alternative
capacity is available. Under Jengka III feeling and clearing has been
completed and planting is progressing satisfactorily. Infrastructure and
village development are behind schedule and settler intake will also be
delayed. Standards of agricultural development are satisfactory, except for
clearing and planting problems encountered in scheme 17 and drainage problems
in scheme 23. FELDA is preparing revised cost estimates for both projects,
taking into account recent fluctuations in the rate of exchange.
Loan No. 967     Johore Land Settlement Project; US$40.0 Million
Loan of February 27, 1974; Effective Date: May 16,
197 ; Closing Date: June 30. 1982
The project, implemented by FELDA, consists of the planting of
65,000 acres of oil palm, and settlement of 4,400 families in the State of
Johore. The agricultural development progresses satisfactorily in line with,
appraisal estimates. In order to speed up settler intake, construction of
access roads and village road networks will be done under contract. Game
damage in the planted areas, mainly by elephants and wild boar, is increasing,
and measures to reduce further damage are being considered. FELDA is preparing
revised cost estimates, taking into account recent fluctuations in the rate
of exchange.

Loan No. 1044    Keratong Land Settlement Project; US$36.0 Million
Loan of October 3, 1974; Effective Date:  January 9,
1977  Closing Date: June 30, 1983
The project, implemented by FELDA, consists of the planting of
55,000 acres of oil palm, the settlement of 3,400 families, the construction
of two palm oil mills and the establishment of two urban settlements. Agri-
cultural development is progressing satisfactorily. However, the Pahang
Tenggara Development Aathority still is understaffed, resulting in implementa-
tion delays of the settlements. FELDA has requested construction of three
palm oil mills with smaller capacities instead of two larger mills as
envisaged in the appraisal report. The feasibility of this proposal is
currently under consideration.
Loan No. 973     Western Johore Agricultural Development Project;
US§I5.O Million Loan of April 5. 1974; Effective Date:
Augut 14, 1974; Closing Date: June 30. 1980
The project includes main and feeder drains, coastal embankments
and tidal gates to improve drainage in an area of 134,000 ha (330,000 ac)
in southwest Peninsular Malaysia, as well as an integrated agricultural
development program with changes in cropping patterns to improve farm
incomes, intercropping, opening up of 24,000 ha of new land, Farmers'
Development Centers and improvements in research, extension and crop
processing. A Project Division has been set up to direct and coordinate
the various agencies iinvolved in project execution, to monitor and
evaluate project progress and to prepare a feasibility study for a second
stage project. Because of the need to re-evaluate some of the design
criteria and delays in survey contracts, and also because of delays in
appointing engineering staff, construction is about one and a half years
behind schedule.
Loan No. 700     Fifth Power Project; US$20.0 Million Loan of
July 6. 1970: Effective Date: September 29. 1970;
Closing Date: January 31. 1977
The project ('the third stage extension of Port Dickson Thermal
Power Station consisting of 3 x 120 MW units) was about 60 percent complete
at the end of December 1975. The Government of Malaysia allowed the National
Electricity Board to apply the fuel surcharge to commercial and industrial
consumers from March 15, 1975. Energy sales increased by 11.3 percent in
FY74. Rate of return was 10.2 percent and self-financing of construction
was 70 percent. NEB's sound financial position was maintained in FY74. A
rate of return of 8.3 percent is anticipated for FY75. Rates of return greater
than 8 percent (8.2 - :3.6 percent) are predicted for FY76 through FY80.

Loan No. 1031    Sixth Power Project; US$45.o Million Loan of
July 25, 1974; Effective Date: October 22, 1974;
Closing Date: June 30, 1980
The project consists of transmission lines required for the
Temengor hydroelectric power station. So far implementation is on
schedule.
Loan No. 753     Second Telecommunications Project; US$18.7 Million
Loan of June 21, 1971; Effective Date:   August 18, 1971;
Closing Date: June 30, 1976
After initial delays in procurement, obtaining sites and erecting
buildings, the Telecmmunications Department of Malaysia (TDB) has made good
progress in carrying out the project. The original project targets for
December 31, 1975, in respect of expansion of the local telephone, telex and
long-distance services were generally met with two exceptions, first, the
number of additional connections will only reach the target of 80,000 lines
in April, 1976, or a delay of four months and secondly, due to delays in
site acquisition and buildings, two of the microwave routes will be completed
only in mid-1977. An extension of the Closing Date will therefore be
required. The reorganization of TDM has been completed and is operating
satisfactorily. TDM's financial results for the 1971-73 period are very
satisfactory with rates of return of about 16 percent as compared with the
appraisal estimates of about 10 percent and the loan covenant of 8 percent.
The operating ratio has been good, between 60-64 percent, and TDM's self-
financing has been high.
Loan No. 908     Second Kuala Lumpur Water Supply Project; US$13.5 Million
Loan of June 14, 1973; Effective Date: August 27, 1973;
Closing Date: June 30, 1978
The project consists of the expansion of facilities to provide piped
water supply to parts of Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley. The facilities will
include an earth dam on the Langat River to form a resevoir to regulate the
river flow. When field surveys were made for the detailed design, the
consultant found that the 175 feet hei-ght of the dam originally planned had
to be raised by 9 feet. The completion of the dam, but not the other
components of the project, is expected to be delayed by about one year to
late 1978. The project cost is presently estimated at about 45 percent more
than the appraisal estimate due to the increased cost of the dam and
adoption of a higher allowance for inflation. No difficulties are foreseen
in rilsing the additional funds required.
Loan No. 774     Sabah Ports Project; US$16.1 Million Loan of
June 30, 1971; Effective Date: August 24, 1971;
Closing Date: March 31, 1976
Except for a new headquarters building in Kota Kinabalu and the
port administration building at Sandakan, all civil works were expected to



ANNEX II
Page 6 of 8
be completed by end 197'. Tota'L cost of the project will be about US$38.0
million, compared to the appraisal estimate of US$22.1 million.  SPA's
financial position is satisfactory and tariff increases have been proposed;
the management of the Authority and operational procedures in the ports
are satisfactory. Studies of proposed additional port works at Tawau and
Sapangar Bay are expected to be available for review in June 1976.
Loan No. 799     Railwav Project; US$16.0 Million Loan of February 11,
1972; Effective Date: April 17, 1972; alosing Date:
December 31. 1975
Initial delay3 in procurement have been overcome. The overall cost
of revised investment pLan (1971-1975) (about M$93.0 million) is less than
the forecast of M$128.0 million due to deletion and deferment of two items.
With the delay in procurement, work on track renewal, worhshops and rolling
stock will be carried over into the first year of the next five year plan.
Management lacks effectiveness largely due to many vacancies in key technical
posts and to imminent retirement of several senior officers. Cperations have
not improved to the extent forecast at appraisal. Passenger traffic continues
to rise faster than antLcipated. Freight traffic remains relatively stagnant,
but considerable improvement is expected next year, due largely to increased
cement traffic. With increasing costs, there were operating losses in 1973,
1974 and 1975. Even if the MR's request for a 10 percent raise in passanger
fares is granted promptLy, there will be further losses in 1976. New invest-
ment proposed by the MR for the Third Five Year Plan (1976-1980)9 to be
reviewed by Parliament in April 1976, totals M$393.0 million; adoption of such
a plan will depend on the Government's decision on the future status of the
railway, particularly in view of the rapid expansion of highways and highway
transport. To assist in making a decision on the future of the Railway, and
on further investment needed, the Government has decided to update the General
Transport Survey of 1969.
Loan No. 851     Kuala `:Jumpur Urban Transport Project; US$16.0 Million
Loan o:: July 20, 1972; Effective Date: September 20,
1972: Closing Date: April 30, 1977
The project is designed to improve the transport facilities between
Kuala Lumpur and the adjacent town of Petaling Jaya. It consists of improve-
ment of about 6 miles ol' Federal Route 2, including detailed engineering,
widening of the road, construction of interchanges and cycle tracks, and
relocation of services. Civil works are 4-6 months behind schedule, due to
shortcomings in the contractor's project management and due to difficulties
in obtaining steel and cement. But the major problems have now been over-
come. The project also includes a transport study for metropolitan Kuala
Lumpur, a national road maintenance study and detailed engineering of about
137 miles of Federal Route 1; all these studies have been completed.

Loan No. 931     Second Highway Project; US$19.5 Million Loan of
August 22, 1973; Effective Date: October 25, 1973;
Closing Date: August 31, 1977
Construction delays were encountered due to weak management of
some contractors, late delivery of construction equipment, late acquisi-
tion of land and approval by the Government of import licenses and work
permits for the contractors' expatriate staff. However, measures have been
taken to overcome most of these deficiencies, and work, including supervision
by consultants, is proceeding satisfactorily, except for one road section
for which contractor management has to be strengthened. Due to the late
start of the fifth and last road section, project completion may be delayed
by up to 20 months. Construction costs have escalated sharply and it is
likely that they will exceed original estimates (including contingencies) by
almost US$17.0 million, or over 50 percent.  Urban studies as well as high-
way feasibility and detailed engineering studies financed under the loan
have been completed.
Loan No. 599     Education Project; US$8.8 Million Loan of May 23. 1969;
Effective Date:  September 16, 1969; Closing Date:
June 30. 1976
Construction has been completed at 20 of 21 project institutions,
and the quality of the completed buildings is satisfactory. Project imple-
mentation is about two and one-half years behind schedule because an alter-
nate site had to be selected for one agricultural school. This school is
now expected to be completed in late 1976. A further extension of the
Closing Date by six months to December 31, 1976, is therefore necessary.
Deliveries of furniture and equipment to the project schools are near
completion expect for one agricultural school. All the 20 project schools are
now in operation and are func,tioning satisfactorily. Although no final
evaluation has yet been made, the schools appear to have achieved low drop-
out rates and high pass rates. The estimated financing under the loan is
expected to be about US$1.7 million lower than originally estimated.
US$700,000 of this amount has been transferred to the second education
project, and proposals have been requested from the Government on use of the
remaining surplus funds.
Loan No. 810     Second Education Project: US$15.5   Million Loan of
April 5, 1972; Effective Date: JulY 7, 1972;
Closing Date: December 31, 1977
Project implementation has improved and is now about ten months
behind schedule mainly due to delays in the appointment of consultant archi-
techts for the Penang University, late approval of the campus plan by the
University and slowness of the Public Works Department in preparation of
documents. Of eight secondary vocational and technical schools, seven are
under construction. Tender has been opened for all the facilities of the
University and the recommended awards are acceptable. Contracts have been
awarded for one-third of the facilities and construction is scheduled to be

completed by mid-1977. Total project cost remains to be about 40 percent
above the original estimate. Progress on equipment procurement is sat-
isfactory.  Disbursements have slightly improved.
Loan No. 974     Third Education Project; US$19.0 Million Loan of
'April5, 1974: Efective Date: June 26     197I
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Project implementation is about three months behind schedule due
to delays in selection of sites for the Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs) but
all sites have now been acquired,   Tenders have been opened for seven of the
thirteen project institutions and all sketch plans have been approved. Con-
struction for seven schools should start in early 1976. Progress on civil
works is satisfactory. Equipment procurement for Kuantan Polytechnic is
slightly behind schedu'Le, but master lists should be ready before March 1976.
Estimated total project cost remains the sam6 as the appraisal estimate.
Disbursement is about one year behind schedule partly due to delays in
equipment procurement 'but should improve in 1976 when civil works construc-
tion starts. The Project Unit is functioning satisfactorily.
Loan No. 880     Population Project; US$5.0 Million Loan of
February 9, 1973; Effective Date: June ?1. 1973;
Closing Date: September 30, 1978
The progress on the civil works component has been very good in
1975. Four buildings were completed and 129 were under construction. The
Senior Research Advisor has joined the National Family Planning Ebard (NFPB).
NFPB is taking action to set up a computerized management information system.
The program performance improved in 1975 with the number of new acceptors
being higher than in any of the previous five years. The Prime Minister
