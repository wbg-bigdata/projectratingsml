APPRAISAL OF SECOND KUALA LUMPUR URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i,        This is the first urban transport project appraised since publica-
tion of the Bank's Sector Policy Paper on Urban Transport and conforms to
the recommendations of the paper. Its main objective is to increase the
efficiency of the transport system in Kuala Lumpur. Public transport serv-
ices will be improved while the use of private cars will be restrained.
The present transport system is inefficient. It is exceptional in its
high rates of private vehicle ownership and use. About 60% of all motorized
trips are made by private transport in Kuala Lumpur, compared to 36% in
Singapore, 26% in Bangkok, and 10% in Istanbul.
ii.       Although the project is essentially an urban transport project,
it also contains important components and initiatives in other urban sectors
such as squatter area upgrading and the development of new low cost settle-
ments. These components are located in an area of Kuala Lumpur which is
being opened up for development through a Bank-financed project, the Second
Highway Project. They form the first stage of a larger program initiated
through the project to provide jobs and services to the urban poor. Poli-
cies and institutions are being established to carry out this program 'both
in Kuala Lumpur and in other urban areas in Malaysia.
iii.      The project consists of civil works, equipment and consulting
services for:  (a) new roads (about 7 miles) and road improvements (10 miles)
with all of the capacity earmarked for exclusive or priority use of
high occupancy vehicles such as buses, minibuses, and car pools; (b) im-
proved traffic engineering and control; i cy residenti-I, indiustrial, com-
mercial, and agricultural sites and services for about 1,400 households and
150 businesses; (d) upgrading of infrastructure services for about 2,100 squat-
ter households; and (e) technical assistance and training to establish and
strengthen a Highway Planning and Public Transport Unit in the Ministry of
Works and Transport, a Traffic Management Department in City Hall, and a Sites
and Services Unit in the Urban Development Authority. Related policy measures
and actions include: (a) introduction of minibus services; (b) abolition of
the bus seat tax; (c) raising of bus fares; (d) introduction of intersection
and access priorities and exclusive lanes and roads for high occupancy vehicles;
(e) raising of parking charges; (f) introduction of an area road pricing scheme
for the central city area; and (g) modification of existing building regula-
tions in favor of low cost design standards. Measures (a), (c), (e) and (g)
have already been implemented, and action on the others has been started.
iv.       Project costs total US$72 million, including contingencies, of
which land acquisition costs are US$6.4 million. Foreign exchange costs are
about 36% of total cost and equal the proposed US$26 million Bank loan.
Cost estimates are based on nearly completed final engineering and on recent
bids for similar works.



- ii -
v.        The Ministry of Works and Transport will be the executing agency.
The Highway Planning and Public Transport Unit of the Ministry will be
responsible for coordinating, monitoring and reporting on the implementa-
tion of the various project components by the Public Works Department of
the same Ministry, City Hall, and the Urban Development Authority.
vi.       The proposed Bank loan of US$26 million would be made to the
Government of Malaysia. The loan would finance 36% of project cost with the
balance of US$46 million provided by the Government. The Bank loan and the
Government contribution would be for (a) direct Government expenditures
(US$63.9 million), (b) a Government grant to City Hall (US$3.5 million),
(c) a Government loan to City Hall (US$4.0 million), and (d) a Government
grant to the Urban Development Authority (US$0.6 million).
vii.      Contracts for civil works and equipment with an estimated total
value of US$42 million (64% of total project cost excluding land acquisi-
tion) would be let under international competitive bidding. It is expected
that contracts for about US$20 million would go to foreign bidders. Civil
works contracts for traffic engineering, sites and services and squatter
area upgrading with a total value of US$13.5 million (21% of total project
cost) would be awarded after local competitive bidding. These works are
relatively small, in scattered locations, and of such character that they
would not attract foreign bidders. All bidding will be in accordance with
Bank guidelines. Retroactive Bank financing is estimated to amount to about
US$0.8 million, mainly for consultants' services for feasibility and engineering
studies.
viii.     The economic rate of return is estimated at about 30% for the
transport and sites and services components. The greatly increased efficiency
of the transport system that will be achieved through the project will enable
the Government to substantially reduce earlier anticipated road investments
in Kuala Lumpur.
ix.       The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$26 million for a
term of 25 years including a grace period of 5 years.



MALAYSIA
APPRAISAL OF SECOND KUALA LUMPUR URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Malaysia is seeking Bank financing for a project
to help reduce traffic congestion in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area, to
initiate a sites and services program aimed at the urban poor, and to assist
in resettling squatters displaced through Bank financed projects. Improve-
ment and construction of two major roads leading into the metropolitan area,
Federal Routes II and I, is under way with financial assistance from the
Bank through two previous loans, 851-MA and 931-MA, for the Kuala Lumpur
Urban Transport Project and the Second Highway Project, respectively. The
proposed project would, inter alia, integrate these two roads into the metro-
politan road network. Delays are being encountered in implementing the two
earlier projects due to poor contractor performance and lack of early atten-
tion to the problem of squatter displacement. The latter problem, which
mostly affects the Second Highway Project, will be solved with the help of
the proposed project.
1.02      The proposed project was originally identified through an Urban
Transport Policy and Planning Study for Metropolitan Kuala Lumpur, partly
financed through Loan 851-MA add executed in 1973 by Wilbur Smith and Asso-
ciates (USA) in association with Llewelyn-Davies Weeks Forestier-Walker &
Bor (UK) and the SGV Group (Singapore). Feasibility and engineering studies
have been under way since mid-1974, partly financed through Loan 931-MA and
executed by Vallentine, Laurie and Davies (Australia). Much of the founda-
tion for these transport studies and for other recent sector studies in Kuala
Lumpur was laid through the Klang Valley Regional Planning and Development
Study, carried out in 1972 and 1973 by the Shankland Cox Partnership (UK) in
association with Freeman Fox and Associates (UK), Coopers and Lybrand (UK)
and Binnie and Partners (Malaysia). It was financed by the UNDP, with the
Bank acting as the executing agency.
1.03      The project was pre-appraised by a Bank mission in February-March
1975. Costs were found to be unacceptably high due to the absence of strong
policy measures that would increase the efficiency of the transport system
by encouraging public transport and restraining private transport. The
Government and the Bank agreed on the introduction of such policy measures
and a substantial reduction in project costs was achieved.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of Messrs. G.J. Roth and
S. Sandstrom (Bank) and A. Bergan, J. Hillier and D. Williams (Consultants)
who visited Malaysia in June-July 1975 to appraise the project.

II. BACKGROUND AND ISSUES
A. The New Economic Policy and Urban Development
2.01      With a per capita income of about US$490 (1973), Malaysia is the
most prosperous developing country in Southeast Asia, with the exceptions
of Hong Kong and Singapore. The GNP increased at a rate of 6% during the
1960's, in constant prices, and the population increase was about 2.5% an-
nually.
2.02      The high average income and its rapid growth conceal, however,
considerable income disparities among and within the three major racial
groups and between rural and urban areas. Malays, who account for a
little more than 50% of the population in Peninsular Malaysia, have
average incomes only about half the level of the Chinese, who account
for about 35% of the population. Indians, who comprise 11% of the popula-
tion, are in between. Also, the racial income imbalances have been increas-
ing. The Malays are concentrated in rural areas and the Chinese in urban
areas. The average urban per capita income is more than twice the rural.
2.03      Imbalances in the ownership of assets are a further source of
economic disparities. In agriculture, Malay landholdings outside tradi-
tional agriculture are negligible and practically all of the estates are
owned either by foreigners or by non-Malays. Similarly, in the corporate
sector the share owned by Malays represents only about 2% of total assets.
Foreigners own as much as 62%, and the remainder is held predominantly by
Chinese.
2.04      The dissatisfaction with the distribution of benefits of economic
growth and concern with growing income inequality provided the basis for the
New Economic Policy (NEP). The aims of the NEP are to reduce the sharp in-
come differences between Malays and non-Malays by reducing the disparities
in the ownership and control of wealth in the modern urban sector and by
reducing the concentration of Malay employment in traditional low income
rural activities while increasing Malay presence in the relatively high
income urban sector.
2.05      Urban and regional development programs are viewed as important
instruments for implementing the NEP. Urban development is used as a vehi-
cle to provide increased employment opportunities and higher incomes to the
Malay population, and their migration from rural to urban areas is encour-
aged. Major development schemes are under way in predominantly Malay popu-
lated lagging regions. The east coast region, where 70% of the population
is Malay, will be given high priority in the Third Malaysia Plan (1976-80).
Kuantan, the capital of Pahang State, has been selected for development to
become the leading city on the east coast. Much emphasis is also placed
on the development of new towns in lagging regions rather than already
existing towns, most of which are located along the more developed west



coast. Malaysia is one of the few countries with a spatial policy for
national development. UNDP is providing technical assistance to further
strengthen this aspect of the Government's national development planning.
B. Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area
History
2.06      The settlement which was to become the city of Kuala Lumpur was
established by Chinese traders in the mid-nineteenth century. It was strat-
egically located at the confluence of the Klang and Gombak rivers. Tin ore
had been discovered in the upper reaches of the two rivers and river traffic
carrying mining personnel, food supplies and tin ore passed through Kuala
Lumpur. There is little river traffic nowadays but tin mining is still of
major importance in the metropolitan area. Many tin mines are still opera-
ting. Abandoned mines offer excellent sites for residential and industrial
sites and services (see para 3.12).
2.07      The population of Kuala Lumpur had increased to about 20,000 in
the early 1890's at which time the British colonial headquarters were trans-
ferred there from the port of Klang on the coast of Malacca Straits, about
25 miles away. At the time of independence in 1957, the population was
about 315,000 in the city itself and about 380,000 in the metropolitan area,
including the new town of Petaling Jaya about 6 miles west of the city.
Petaling Jaya was established in 1953 and was the first new town in develop-
ing countries inspired by the British post-war new towns. By 1973, the
population was about 490,000 in Kuala Lumpur, 100,000 in Petaling Jaya and
a total of 860,000 in the conurbation, growing at a rate of about 3.7% an-
nually. The whole conurbation was located in the State of Selangor.
Administration
2.08      By 1973, the city of Kuala Lumpur covered 36 square miles.  The
State owned large tracts of land and the State Government exerted some land
use control through its constitutional powers over the sale or lease of state
land and to control changes in land use. In February 1974, the Parliament
passed an amendment to the Constitution through which the city area was ex-
panded to 94 square miles and became a Federal Territory under the direct
control of the Federal Government.
2.09      The State of Selangor's ownership and control of land within the
new Federal Territory was taken over by the Federal Government, which esta-
blished a Federal Territory Land Executive Committee to deal with land
matters. The Committee is chaired by the Chief Secretary to the Government
but has no technical planning staff. Land administration is handled by a
new Federal Territory Land Office. The Prime Minister now appoints the Mayor
who heads the city administration, usually referred to as City Hall.   City
Hall prepares the budget for the Federal Territory but it must be approved
by the Ministry of Local Government and Environment. City Hall is formally



-4-
responsible for land use planning, or zoning, in the Federal Territory but
does not have the capacity to carry out the work and, most importantly, lacks
the powers to enforce zoning. City Hall has remained largely unchanged, with
no significant staff increases, in spite of the 1974 tripling of the area it
administers and the corresponding increase in population which now is about
780,000.
2.10      The 1974 Federal Territory legislation was drafted and enacted
over a short time period and in a politically sensitive climate. Little at-
tention was paid to the administrative and planning needs of the Territory.
The present institutional fragmentation and the complete lack of effective
spatial planning and capital programming for the Territory are serious is-
sues which have to be dealt with. Work is under way, in part by virtue of
the proposed project (see paras. 4.19 - 4.21).
2.11      The present planning and policy-making vacuum in the Territory
nas led major public and semi-public agencies outside City Hall to initiate
their own efforts at metropolitan planning. Noteworthy is the Federal Urban
Development Authority (UDA) (see paras. 4.16 - 4.18) which has been charged
with a major responsibility for increasing Malay ownership and employment
in the modern urban sector. With UNDP assistance, UDA is undertaking a
study of infrastructure service levels and of land uses and land ownership
in the Federal Territory and is preparing a development strategy for the
Territory to assist in its investment decisions. UDA has been instrumental
in identifying and preparing the sites and services component of the pro-
posed project (see para. 3.12).
People and Jobs
2.12      Some 55% of the population in the metropolitan area are Chinese
and 25% Malay, proportions which are typical for urban areas in Malaysia.
The average monthly personal household income was about K$990 (US$395) in
1975, about 20% above the average urban income and about 90% above the na-
tional average. Household income distributions are in Annex 1. The Govern-
ment is attempting to shift new investments to other regions and to curb the
growth rate of Kuala Lumpur.
2.13      Jobs are heavily concentrated in the administration and services
sectors (about 40%) and in manufacturing (about 20%). The corresponding
percentages for Peninsular Malaysia are only about 20% and 10%, respectively.
As jobs in these two sectors increase much more rapidly than in other sectors,
at about 4.5% and 6% per year nation-wide, respectively, the Government is
unlikely to be able to reduce the growth rate of Kuala Lumpur's population
much below the present rate of 3.7% per year, about 1% above the national
average. The Malay population is expected to increase slightly more rapidly
than the non-Malay.
2.14      A large portion of Kuala Lumpur's population cannot afford satis-
factory housing and does not have access to adequate infrastructure services.



-5-
Seventy-five percent of the population are not served by a water-borne sewerage
system whereas most of the population have access to piped water supply. A high
portion of the population, about 30%, squat on unserviced public and private
land, as do a similarly high proportion of small- and medium-sized businesses.
An inadequate public transport system severely restricts the access of the poor
to employment opportunities.
C. Transport in Kuala Lumpur
The Problem
2.15      Kuala Lumpur's transport system is not cost-effective.  It is
exceptional in its high rates of private vehicle ownership and use due to
the relatively high income level and the lack of policy measures to curb
uneconomic private travel. In 1973, its population owned an average of 122
cars and motor cycles per 1,000 persons and 60% of all motorized trips were
by private transport. Comparable figures for some other cities are shown in
the following table:
Kuala Lumpur      Bangkok     Singapore      Istanbul
(1973)         (1972)        (1968)          (1970)
Cars and motor cycles
per 1,000 persons            122             61            64            20
Proportion of motorized
trips made by private
transport                    60              26            36            10
Annual rate of growth of
automobiles 1960-1970        11              12             7            12
2.16      Public transport service standards in Kuala Lumpur are low and
have been deteriorating. Buses are extremely crowded with long queues at
bus stops. There are about 715 buses, operated by eight private companies
(see Annex 2). Bus fares remained unchanged at Mi4 (US,1.6) per mile between
1953 and 1975, resulting in low or non-existent profit margins and providing
little incentive to expand or upgrade services.  In addition to regular fuel
and vehicle taxes, the bus companies also have to pay a monthly "seat tax"
of M$10 (US$4) per seat plus M$7.50 (US$3) per authorized standing space, or
12% of gross revenues, whichever is less.  The seat tax amounts to about
M$5,000 (US$2,000) per year for a typical bus. The tax discourages increased
provision of bus transport capacity, particularly for peak hour use. Supple-
mentary public transport services, such as the mini-buses of Singapore, the
dolmus of Istanbul, and the jeepneys of Manila, are non-existent. There
has in the past been little Government effort to improve public transport.



-6-
2.17          The high and increasing proportion of low occupancy vehicles (LOVs)
has led to inefficient utilization of road space. Kuala Lumpur now suffers
from severe traffic congestion which particularly affects bus services.
Commercial and interregional traffic is also seriously affected by the con-
gestion. At present peak hour speeds of 10-12 mph in the city center. con-
gestion costs are high and are not reflected in adequate road user charges.
The cost of expanding the road network to meet future unrestrained travel
demand would be prohibitive with the present high proportibn of LOVs and
low proportion of HOVs (high occupancy vehicles).
The Search for Solutions
2.18      The Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project (Loan 851-MA) and the
Second Highway Project (Loan 931-MA) (para. 1.01) are aimed at improving
interregional transport and do not specifically address the urban transport
problem. However, through Loan 851-MA the Bank helped finance the Urban
Transport Policy and Planning Study for Metropolitan Kuala Lumpur which
the Government undertook in 1973. The purpose of the study was to pro-
pose policy measures that would increase the efficiency of the transport
system and to prepare a comprehensive transport investment program through
1990.
2.19      The consultants recommended that transport planning and invest-
ment in the Kuala Lumpur area be based on priority for public transport
and restraint of private transport. A 1973-1990 transport investment
program of M$1,000 million (US$400 million) (1973 prices) was recommended,
of which M$700 million (US$280 million) would be for roads. The Govern-
ment agreed with the general thrust of the recommendations but, following
the advice of the Bank, did not accept the investment program. It was felt
that the policy measures recommended would not be sufficient to provide a
low-cost solution to the transport problem and to ensure that a substantial
portion of the benefits of the investments would go to low income groups
dependent on public transport, rather than to high income private car users.
The Government, in consultation with the Bank, decided to introduce stronger
policy measures than recommended by the consultants in order to reduce the
investment program. These policy decisions form the basis for the proposed
project which also includes the first stage of a substantially reduced
road investment program.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The proposed project is the first urban transport project appraised
since publication of the Bank's Sector Policy Paper on Urban Transport, and



-7-
conforms to the recommendations of the paper. Its main purpose is to make
more efficient use of existing and planned transport facilities in the Kuala
Lumpur area (see paras. 5.01 - 5.02). The use of HOVs is to be encouraged
and the use of LOVs discouraged. The proportion of total motorized person
trips by bus in the peak periods is to be raised by 10% by 1980 and by a
further 5% by 1985. Average private car and taxi occupancy is to be raised
by about 10% by 1980 and by a further 5% by 1985. Public transport services
are to be improved. The project will also facilitate the collection and
dispersal of interregional traffic using the federal routee being improved
and built under the two previous Bank-financed projects (para. 2.18 and
Map 1).
3.02      Finally, the project initiates programs for squatter area upgrad-
ing and the development of low cost urban settlements and, concurrently,
provides for an orderly and socially acceptable resettlement of squatter
households and businesses being displaced by major construction projects.
B. Main Features
3.03      To achieve the above objectives, the project comprises:
(a)  Policy measures aimed at improving public transport
services and restraining the use of private cars:
(i) increased bus fares;
(ii)  abolition of the bus seat tax;
(iii) introduction of mini-bus services;
(iv)  introduction of traffic priorities for HOVs;
(v)  increased parking charges; and
(vi)  area road pricing of LOVs.
Implementation of the policy measures is well under way
(see paras. 3.04-3.09).
(b) Physical components:
(i) new roads and road improvements;
(ii) traffic engineering and control; and
(iii) sites and services.

(c) Technical assistance:
(i) Consultants' services for feasibility and engineering
studies and for construction supervision;
(ii) Advisers on traffic management and public transport;
(iii) Consultants' services for the preparation of a national
sites and services program; and
(iv) Training of traffic management, public transport, and
housing personnel.
C. Detailed Description
Policy Measures
3.04      Improving Public Transport Services:  To improve the financial
situation of the bus companies, and thereby enabling them to upgrade and
expand their services, the Government has recently allowed the bus fares
to be increased, from Mi4 to MJ5 per mile. The Government will also abolish
the bus seat tax and assurances were obtained during negotiations that the tax
will be phased out gradually over four years, 1976-79, for old vehicles, and
that for new buses and mini-buses it will be abolished entirely during 1976.
This is expected to induce an immediate expansion of the bus fleet. Assurances
were also obtained from the Government during negotiations that (a) the _
structure and levels of bus and mini-bus fares will be reviewed annually and
adjusted as necessary to permit the services to be provided on a commercial
basis, and (b) licenses to operate public transport vehicles will be issued
in sufficient number to enable the project objectives to be achieved. Capital
to finance the purchase of new buses is available through commercial banks
and other local credit institutions.  Technical assistance to the bus com-
panies will be provided as part of the project (see paras. 4.04-4.05).
3.05      In March 1975, the Government decided to introduce mini-bus serv-
ices in the Kuala Lumpur area to complement existing taxi and bus services.
The mini-buses provide a high frequency and high quality transport service
with good area coverage and with efficient utilization of road space (Annex
3). About 1,000 license applications have been received to operate a total
of about 2,200 mini-buses. About 100 mini-buses were in operation by Decem-
ber 31, 1975 and about 400 additional mini-buses are to be introduced by
mid-1976, covering 28 routes with an average length of 12 miles. The fare
has been initially fixed at Mi40 (USd16) per trip which is about twice the
price of bus travel and about 25% of the price of taxi travel. Capital to
finance the purchase of mini-buses is available through local banks and
credit institutions. Technical assistance for training in mini-bus opera-
tions will be provided as part of the project.



-9-
3.06      Buses, mini-buses, and, in certain cases, taxis and cars with 4
people or more (HOVs), will be given intersection and access priorities, and/
or exclusive lanes, at times and places where they would otherwise be delayed
through congestion caused by LOVs. Delays to LOVs will be accepted as
a matter of policy and will help achieve the objective of getting a shift
to more economical forms of transport. A network of "Designated HOV
Routes" covering all major arterials and the city center has been defined and
will be developed through traffic engineering measures and minor civil works
that are part of the project (see para 3.11 and Annex 6). Federal Routes II
and I, which are being constructed under the two previous Bank loans, will
form part of the HOV route network (see Maps 1 and 2). Assurances were
obtained from the Government and City Hall during negotiations that these
HOV lanes, routes and priorities will be implemented as part of the project
to form the defined network of Designated HOV Routes.
3.07      Restraining Uneconomic Private Car Use:  The policy of not meeting
the full demand for road space by LOVs will result in excessive LOV traffic
congestion in the central area, reflecting the underpricing of road space
there. The price of LOV travel in the center has therefore to be increased.
In November 1975, the Government raised the parking charges from Mi30 (USU12)
per hour to MJ40 (USd16) for the first hour and MJ50 (USd20) per half hour
thereafter. The rate structure discourages long term parking. (See Annex 4.)
3.08      Higher parking charges will not discourage the use of road space
by through, or non-parking, traffic which at present accounts for about half
of the traffic in the city center. The Government and City Hall have there-
fore decided to introduce area road pricing by July 1, 1977 and assurances
to this effect were obtained during negotiations. The necessary legislation
was passed by the Parliament in November 1975. The proposed details of the
scheme are outlined in Annex 7. LOVs entering the central area during peak
hours will be charged M$2 (US$0.80) per day or M$40 (US$16) for a monthly
license. The revenues will accrue to City Hall. The priced zone will
initially cover about 1 sq mile and will be expanded by 1980 (see Map 2).
A similar pricing scheme was introduced in Singapore in June 1975 and is
being closely followed by the Bank through its research program.
3.09      Enforcement:  To effectively implement the policy measures, steps
are being taken to strengthen the enforcement of traffic regulations and
public transport service standards. In June 1975, City Hall introduced
equipment and personnel to tow away broken down and illegally parked vehi-
cles. A Traffic Warden Force was established by City Hall in June 1975 (see
para 4.13). Recruitment of additional vehicle safety enforcement officers
is under way in the Road Transport Department of the MWT and public transport
service inspectors are being introduced (see para 4.06).
Physical Components
3.10      New Roads and Road Improvements:  about 7 miles of new roads and
10 miles of road improvements. All of the new capacity is to be part of the



- 10 -
network of Designated HOV Routes (para 3.06) on which HOVs will have priority
or exclusive use. The component will (see Annex 5 and Map 1):
(a) link Federal Highways I and II with the urban road network
and with each other;
(b) complete a Middle Ring Road around the city center;
(c) provide bus stops and other HOV facilities along Federal
Highways I and II; and
(d) improve an Inner Ring Road which by 1980 will become the
cordon of the expanded road pricing area.
3.11      Traffic Engineering and Control:  The component comprises (Map 2):
(a) improvement of 12 major intersections (see Annex 6);
(b) implementation of a traffic circulation plan for the central
area, including the provision of traffic signals and master
control equipment for an area traffic control system capable
of giving traffic priorities to HOVs (see Annex 6);
(c) implementation of a 4-year program of HOV priority schemes
to provide traffic priorities for HOVs along the designated
routes (see Annex 6);
(d) implementation of the area road pricing scheme, including
(i) signs, (ii) gantry entrances, (iii) sale booths, and (iv)
information material; (see Annex 7); and
(e) equipment and training for traffic monitoring.
3.12      Sites and Services:  The component includes the first stage of
the development of a low cost settlement on and around abandoned tin mines
in the Salak South area, south of the city center, an area with high devel-
opment potential whose accessibility is being improved through the Second
Highway Project (see Annex 8 and Maps 3 and 4):
(a) about 50 acres of residential sites and services for 750
households;
(b) about 27 acres of industrial sites and services for 120
businesses;
(c) about 2 acres of commercial sites and services for
20 businesses;
(d) about 25 acres of agricultural sites and services
for small scale vegetable and pig farming (18 businesses);



1 11 -
(e) upgrading of infrastructure services for about
2,100 squatter households;
(f) provision of community facilities: one primary
school, one health clinic, and two community halls;
and
(g) equipment and training for monitoring and evaluation.
This part of the component will be implemented in two phases, with the first
phase providing new sites for squatters displaced through mainly the con-
struction of Seremban Expressway (the Second Highway Project, Loan 931-MA):

In a third phase, the component will provide new sites for about 600 squat-
ter households that will be displaced through the construction of sewage
treatment plants under the proposed Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project. Reset-
tlement sites for these squatters have yet to be selected and assurances
were obtained from City Hall and the Government during negotiations that
site selection will be satisfactory to the Bank. The component also in-
cludes the establishment of a Sites and Services Unit in UDA, and recurrent
expenditures for the Unit through 1978 are included in project costs.

3.15      Total project cost is estimated at M$180 million (US$72 million)
of which land acquisition costs are M$16.0 million (US$6.4 million). Foreign
exchange costs are M$65 million (US$26 million) or 36% of total project
cost. Design standards are appropriate. They are detailed in Annex 11,
for roads, and in Annex 8, for sites and services. For the transport com-
ponents, the cost estimates are based on (a) detailed engineering (completed
for Components A.2.b, A.5 and A.6 and nearly completed for the others), and
(b) prices experienced in bids for similar works during 1975. For Phase 1
of the sites and services component, the cost estimates are based on detailed
engineering and, for earthworks, on bids which have already been received.
For Phase 2 and 3, the cost estimates are preliminary, Assurances were
obtained from City Hall and UDA during negotiations that Phase 2 and 3 site
layouts and engineering designs will be satisfactory to the Bank and parti-
cularly that design standards will be no higher than for Phase 1. The price
contingencies are based mainly on a review of price trends under the first
Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project. They are, for equipment 10% in 1976
and 8% thereafter, and for civil works 12% in 1976 and 10% thereafter.
E. Execution
3.16      The MWT will be the executing agency with its HP & PTU responsible
for coordinating, monitoring and reporting on project implementation. The
Public Works Department (PWD) of the same Ministry will be responsible for
implementing Components A.1-A.9, and City Hall for Components A.10, B and C,
with UDA implementing Component C, sites and services, on behalf of City
Hall. Consultants' assistance in implementing the project will be provided
and assurances were obtained during negotiations that the consultants will
be satisfactory to the Bank and be employed on terms and conditions acceptable
to the Bank.
3.17      Prequalification of contractors began in September 1975.  The
project will be implemented over a period of about four years, 1976-79. The
Closing Date will be June 30, 1981, which allows a margin of about 15 months
after the estimated completion of the works to accommodate final payments and
some slippage. A summary implementation schedule is in Chart 4. A detailed
schedule of initial key implementation actions is in Annex 14; it was agreed
upon during negotiations.
F. Financing
3.18      It is proposed that a Bank loan of US$26 million (M$65 million)
be made to the Government to finance 36% of total project cost, equal to the
foreign exchange cost, and to be repaid over 25 years including a grace period
of five years for repayment of the principal. The balance, US$46 million
(M$115 million), would be financed by the Government. The Bank loan would
be for (a) direct Government expenditures (US$22.3 million), (b) a Govern-
ment grant to City Hall (US$1.6 million), (c) a Government loan to City Hall



- 15 -
(US$1.8 million) on the same terms as the Bank loan, and (d) a Government
grant to UDA (US$0.3 million). The Government contribution would be for
(a) direct expenditures (US$41.6 million), (b) a grant to City Hall (US$1.9
million), (c) a loan to City Hall (US$2.2 million) on the same terms as
the Bank loan, and (d) a grant to UDA (US$0.3 million). The grants to City
Hall and UDA and the loan to City Hall would be for the sites and services
component whereas the Government prefers to treat the expenditures for all
other project components as direct Government expenditures.
3.19      The project components would be financed as follows (US$ million):

G. Cost Recovery
Transport Components
3.20      Road user charges in Malaysia and Kuala Lumpur are high and will
fully cover the project costs. For a typical car-mile, M45 are paid in fuel
and tire taxes and annual license fees. Road user charges in the Kuala Lumpur
area now average about M$60 million per year, while expenditures on road con-
struction, maintenance and traffic control do not exceed M$30 million per year.
However, a typical car using Kuala Lumpur's central area streets in peak



- 16 -
hours, traveling at the present average speed of 10-12 mph, slows down
the rest of the iraffic and thus imposes costs on other travelers and
vehicles which amount to about M150 for each mile it travels, or some M$2
for a typical home to work round-trip, about six times the present road user
charges. These very high congestion costs imposed by LOVs will in the fu-
ture be more than fully covered by the license fees under the area road
pricing scheme. The congestion costs for a home to work round-trip will drop
to less than M$2 because of the reduction in congestion achieved through the
project.
Sites and Services Component
3.21      The cost of land, earthworks, roads, on-plot infrastructure, core
housing and materials (financed through the US$4.0 million loan to City Hall,
para. 3.19) will be recovered by City Hall from the beneficiaries through
direct plot sales with a minimum 15% downpayment and the balance to be paid
over 20 years at 12% annual interest rate. The cheapest residential plots,
1,200 sq ft plots in Phase 2, will cost only M$3,700 (US$1,480), including
M$1,000 for materials to complete the core house.  The land, all of which is
Government owned, has been priced at its estimated market value without
improvements, M$1.0 (US$0.4) per sq ft net. The cost of off-plot water supply
and sewerage infrastructure (financed by part of the US$3.5 million grant
to City Hall, para. 3.19), will be recovered through water charges (M$1.00
(US$0.40) per 1,000 gallons for-domestic consumption and M$1.20 (US$0.48)
per 1,000 gallons for commercial and industrial consumption) and sewerage
charges (a surcharge of M$0.60 (US$0.24) per 1,000 gallons of water consumption
plus a 2% area tax assessment on annual property values, to be implemented
under the Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project). The current expenditures for
the Sites and Services Unit in UDA through 1978, including the cost of
monitoring and evaluation, will be borne by the Government (see para. 4.18).
Assurances were obtained from City Hall during negotiations that plot sales
will be on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
3.22      The spread in interest rates between the 8.5% charged on the Gov-
ernment loan to City Hall (para. 3.18) and the 12% City Hall will charge
project beneficiaries, will cover the cost of administration and defaults
and generate a small surplus. An additional surplus will accrue to City
Hall from the sale of the Government owned land. The total cash surplus
is estimated at about M$6 million (US$2.4 million) by 1980 (Annex 8) and will
be part of a revolving fund to be set up for financing of future sites and
services projects. Assurances were obtained from the Government and City
Hall during negotiations that the cash surplus, including all revenues from
land sales, will go into the revolving fund and will be used exclusively to
finance future sites and services and squatter area upgrading projects.
Each squatter household displaced through road construction projects executed
by PWD in the Federal Territory receive M$500 in cash compensation (not
included in project cost). In addition, for each such household resettled
on the project site, PWD will contribute M$1,500 to the revolving fund.



- 17 -
H. Procurement and Disbursement
3.23      Contracts for all new roads and road improvements and for all
equipment for traffic engineering and control, with an estimated total
value of US$42 million (64% of total project cost excluding land acquisi-
tion), will be let under international competitive bidding in accordance
with Bank guidelines. Contracts for about US$3 million will be for
equipment and the remainder for civil works. A margin of preference of
15% or the applicable customs duties, whichever is lower, will be applied
to domestic bidders offering domestically manufactured goods. Contractors
will be allowed to bid either for contract packages with an average cost of
about US$7 million or for small individual contracts. Foreign contractors
will be encouraged to use local subcontractors. It is expected that con-
tracts for about US$20 million will be awarded to foreign contractors.
These contracts are for (a) complex bridge structures and works requiring
extensive management skills in which local experience is limited, and (b)
traffis signaling and control equipment not manufactured locally.
3.24      Civil works contracts for traffic engineering, sites and services,
and squatter area upgrading, with an estimated total value of US$13.5 million
(21% of total project cost excluding land acquisition), will be awarded after
local competitive bidding in accordance with Bank guidelines. The civil
works contracts for traffic engineering (US$6.5 million) will cover the first
four years of a continuing program of improvements. They are relatively
small, ranging in size from US$20,000 to US$500,000 and in scattered loca-
tions, and would not attract foreign contractors. The civil works contracts
for sites and services and for squatter area upgrading are also individually
small and are unlikely to attract foreign contractor interest. Given the
urgency of squatter relocation, the first contracts for sites and services
are being let under local procedures which have been reviewed by the Bank
and are acceptable.   Contracts for consulting services (US$9.5 million) will
be awarded on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.
3.25      One civil works contract for about US$0.1 million for sites and
services has been awarded, with some retroactive Bank financing to be provided.
Retroactive financing amounting to about US$0.7 million will also be provided
for feasibility and engineering studies of the proposed project.
3.26      A schedule of disbursements of the Bank loan is in Annex 12.  Dis-
bursements will be made for expenditures, local or foreign, as follows:
(a) 35% of expenditures for civil works for new roads, road
improvements, and traffic engineering and control (Project
Components A and B);
(b) 100% of c.i.f. cost of equipment for traffic engineering
and control (Component B) if directly imported; 70% of
local expenditures if imported but procured locally; and
100% of ex-factory costs if locally manufactured;



- 18 -
(c)  45% of expenditures for (i) civil works for sites and
services and squatter area upgrading, and (ii) the Sites
and Services Unit in UDA through 1978 (see para. 4.18)
(Component C); and
(d)  50% of expenditures for technical assistance (Component D).
3.27      Any loan funds remaining after project completion would be used
to help finance additional schemes for traffic engineering and control
improvements, sites and services, and/or squatter area upgrading. Such
schemes would be submitted to the Bank for review and approval.
I. Accounts, Audit and Progress Reports
3.28      Separate project accounts will be maintained by each implementing
agency and a comprehensive project account by the HP & PTU. The Auditor
General of Malaysia conducts independent external audits of all implementing
agencies. The quality of the audits is satisfactory. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that all project accounts will be audited annually by the
Auditor General or other independent auditors acceptable to the Bank, and
that the auditor's report and financial statements will be sent to the Bank
within nine months after the end of each fiscal year. Assurances were also
obtained during negotiations that quarterly progress reports will be prepared
and submitted to the Bank, reporting on, inter alia, the physical, contractual
and financial progress of the project including project performance relative
to key performance indicators (see paras. 5.01 and 5.16 and Annex 10).
J. Supervision
3.29      About 100 man-weeks of Bank supervision will be required over
the four-year implementation period, with about 30 man-weeks during the
first year (Annex 13). Key implementation actions on which the supervision
initially should focus are listed in Annex 14.
IV. ADMINISTRATION AND PLANNING
4.01      The responsibility for the transport sector in the Federal Terri-
tory is divided as follows: the HP & PTU of the MWT is responsible for over-
all transport planning and coordination and for public transport; the PWD of
the MWT for the design and construction of specific major arterial and ring
roads; City Hall for the design and construction of all other roads, for
traffic engineering and control, and for all road maintenance; and the Traf-
fic Police (under the Ministry of Home Affairs), jointly with City Hall, for
the enforcement of traffic regulations. This arrangement is satisfactory.
Specific actions to strengthen the above institutions are being taken under



- 19 -
the proposed project (see paras. 4.02-4.13). The integration of transport
planning with planning in other sectors is unsatisfactory and Wis issue is
being dealt with (see paras. 4.19-4.21).
A. Highway Planning and Public Transport Unit
4.02      The HP & PTU was established in January 1975 and based on the
former Highway Planning Unit. The Director of the HP & PTU reports directly
to the Secretary General of the MWT. New staff for public transport func-
tions were hired during the spring of 1975 and a Deputy Director, Public
Transport, was appointed in July 1975. The Unit now hps a total staff of
about 40. It is doing a substantial amount of work ot satisfactory
quality, including regular traffic surveys on all federal roads, and proj-
ect preparation. The organization is shown in Chart 1.
4.03      The Unit's initial work on public transport has been to coordinate
the preparation of the proposed project and to start implementing its policy
measures. The focus has therefore been on the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area
but the work will subsequently be extended to implement the Government's urban
transport policy in other towns in Malaysia.
4.04      The Unit is responsible for introducing minibus operations in the
Kuala Lumpur area (para. 3.05). It has designed the route network and pre-
pared operations guidelines (Annex 3). The major public transport functions
of the Unit include (a) the further development, implementation and enforce-
ment of policies, performance criteria, and programs to provide a satisfac-
tory level of public transport service; (b) the administration of transport
planning, including the delineation of responsibilities between the Unit and
State and Local Governments and the coordination of transport planning with
planning in other sectors; (c) the provision of advisory services and training
to public transport operators on, inter alia, management, accounting, and
maintenance; and (d) monitoring of the implementation of the proposed project.
4.05      Technical assistance to the Unit is now provided through the UNDP
and bilateral aid. Two short-term advisers, financed by the UNDP, have
assisted in the introduction of minibuses and in organizing the Unit's public
transport work. Two advisers will be provided under the proposed project for
a period of two years. Draft terms of reference agreed upon by the Government
and the Bank are in Annex 15. Assurances were obtained during negotiations
that the advisers will be satisfactory to the Bank and employed on terms and
conditions acceptable to the Bank.
4.06      To initiate the Unit's extensive work of inspecting and surveying
public transport operations, a team of initially six inspectors will be re-
cruited and appointed by March 31, 1976 (Annex 14). Enforcement of safety
regulations for motor vehicles is the responsibility of the Road Transport
Department of the MWT. Twenty-one additional posts for enforcement officers
were approved in the spring of 1975 and recruitment is under way.



- 20 -
B. Public Works Department
4.07      The PWD, with a total technical staff of about 290, is headed by a
Director General with two deputies, for development and engineering services,
respectively. The Director General reports to the Secretary General of the
MWT. Under the Deputy Director General, Development, there are five operating
divisions of which one, the Roads Division, is responsible for the construction
and maintenance of all federal roads. The organization is shown in Chart 2.
4.08      The Roads Division is organized into six sections:  Project Coor-
dination, Design, Implementation, Project Management, Maintenance, and a
special section for federal land development schemes. The Roads Division
is implementing the Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project (Loan 851-MA) and
the Second Highway Project (Loan 931-MA) and is also responsible for the
implementation of a major portion of the proposed project (para. 3.16). The
division functions efficiently and has substantially reduced the staff
shortage that in the past has hampered its work.
C. Traffic Management Department
4.09      The TMD in City Hall was established in June 1975.  A director
and three engineers have been appointed and three additional engineers
seconded to the TMD. Recruitment of additional staff is in progress.
4.10      The TMD will have five divisions and a total staff of initially
about twenty-five persons plus about forty traffic wardens (see para. 4.13).
The divisions would cover: Planning, Design, Construction and Maintenance,
Traffic Signals, and Enforcement. The organization is shown in Chart 3.
4.11      The TMD is responsible for traffic management in the Federal
Territory, involving the following: transport planning together with the
HP & PTU; design and implementation of traffic engineering and control
schemes; maintenance of traffic signals, road markings and street furni-
ture; area road pricing; traffic safety and education; and review and en-
forcement of traffic regulations together with the Traffic Police. Imple-
mentation of Project Component B is the responsibility of the TMD (para.
3.16).
4.12      Technical assistance to the TMD will be provided under the proposed
project through four advisers to be retained for a period of two years. The
major tasks of the advisers would be to assist in staff recruitment and train-
ing and in implementing the area road pricing scheme, the area traffic con-
trol system, and the HOV priority schemes. Draft terms of reference agreed
upon by City Hall and the Bank are in Annex 15. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that the advisers will be satisfactory to the Bank and
employed on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank.



- 21 -
The Traffic Warden Force
4.13      A Traffic Warden Force was established in June 1975 under a
temporary head reporting directly to the City Administrator. A staff of
40 traffic wardens have been appointed and took on their duties in August
1975, after having been trained by the Traffic Police. The major task of
the Force is to augment the Traffic Police in its enforcement of traffic
regulations and to assist the public in adjusting to the new transport policy
measures. Certain police powers, such as to ticket traffic offenders and
to direct traffic, have been given to the wardens. To ensure the necessary
coordination with the activities of the TMD, the Force will become part of
its Enforcement Division by March 31, 1976 (Annex 14).
D. Housing Unit
4.14      The Housing Unit in City Hall was established, and its director
appointed, in July 1975. The Housing Unit has taken over the responsibility
for housing development in the Federal Territory which prior to February
1974 was carried by the Selangor State Economic Development Corporation.
Staff will be transferred to the Housing Unit from various other depart-
ments in City Hall involved with housing, and new staff recruited.
4.15      As regards the sites and services component of the proposed project,
the Housing Unit and the Land Office (para. 2.09), with assistance from
UDA, will be responsible for settler selection, technical assistance in
self-help construction, and collection of payments. Assurances were obtained
during negotiations that settler selection criteria will be acceptable to
the Bank and inter alia that (a) at least 90% of all residential lots of
1,200 sq ft not required for displaced squatters will be allocated to households
earning less than M$300 (US$120) per month (1975 prices), about the 20th
percentile on the income distribution curve for Kuala Lumpur, and (b) at least
90% of all residential lots of 1,800 sq ft not required for displaced squat-
ters will be allocated to households earning less than M$400 (US$160) per
month, about the 30th percentile.
E. Urban Development Authority
4.16      UDA was established in 1971 as a statutory body to promote and
carry out projects in urban areas for development, public housing, and other
public services, and to translate into action programs the Government's
policy of restructuring society through urban development. UDA is generally
viewed as having a key role in the implementation of the New Economic Policy.
It is governed by a Board which is responsible to the Prime Minister. The
Chairman and Deputy Chairman are full-time officers. UDA has a total staff
of about 350. The Government provides a large portion of UDA's development
funds, as loans to be repaid over 20 years at an annual interest rate of 6%.
UDA also raises funds from commercial banks and other private sources.



- 22 -
4.17      UDA's activities have been dominated by joint venture participa-
tion in large scale developments such as shopping centers, hotels, office
buildings, and housing complexes in the Federal Territory, with UDA normally
being the initiating and planning agency. UDA to a large extent acts as
an agent for the Malay population and makes investments and retains owner-
ship of its developments on their behalf. The low-income portion of the
Malay population, who mostly live in rural areas and small towns, have so
far directly benefitted little from UDA's activities. Recognizing this,
UDA will under the Third Malaysia Plan increasingly turn its attention to
projects that are directly aimed at this group.
4.18      The sites and services component of the proposed project is a
concrete example of UDA's attempt to broaden its role and UDA intends to
plan and implement such projects on a larger and nationwide scale. To
this end, UDA is establishing a new Sites and Services Unit within its
organization. The Unit would have a staff of about 20 (Annex 8). Current
expenditures for staff salaries and for training and equipment through
December 31, 1978 are included in the project cost and would total about
M$1 million (US$400,000) (excluding contingencies). The proposed Bank loan
would cover 45% of this cost with the balance provided by the Government
(para. 3.18). About 35% of the cost would be for the monitoring and evalua-
tion of the sites and services project component, about 30% for surveys
and detailed engineering designs for this component, about 20% for training
and equipment, and the balance of 15% for preparation of additional projects.
Job descriptions and a work program for the Unit will be prepared by March 31,
1976 (Annex 14).
F. Metropolitan Planning
4.19      The emphasis of the proposed project is on the transport sector
where specific policy decisions have been taken and where definite institu-
tional improvements are being made. It is, however, recognized that the
full benefits of the project, as well as of projects in other sectors in-
cluding the proposed Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project, cannot be realized
without improved intersectoral metropolitan planning and budgeting. The
Bank is therefore advising the Government and City Hall on what steps should
be taken to resolve the broader planning issues and will continue to do so
in the course of project implementation. Due to the complexity of these
issues and their political sensitivity, their resolution will take some time.
4.20      The Government has initiated a review of the planning issues in
Kuala Lumpur (para. 2.10), with the assistance of a consultant financed by
UNDP. A program to continue this work and to prepare development plans for
the Federal Territory was discussed and agreed on during negotiations. It
includes the following main steps:



- 23 -
(a) The Government will, together with City Hall, by
July 1, 1976 establish an inter-governmental task
force to carry out development policy analysis, broad
spatial planning, capital programming and project
reviews in the Federal Territory. The task force
will be provided with the necessary technical staff,
and with technical assistance which the Government is
expected to obtain through UNDP;
(b)  The Government will by September 1, 1976, in consultation
with the Bank, prepare a detailed two-year work program
for the task force, including terms of reference for the
technical assistance;
(c) The Government will prepare reconmendations on an insti-
tutional framework and processes suitable over the longer
term for the continuation of the task force's work and
for decision-making. One proposal which will be further
investigated is to transform the task force into a permanent
technical unit attached to the Land Executive Committee
(para 2.09) and to expand the powers of the Committee to
include policy making, broad spatial planning, capital
programming and project sanctioning; and
(d) The task force, or the long-term institutional framework
referred to in (c), will by January 1, 1978 prepare a
ten-year spatial development plan and a five-year capital
budget for the Federal Territory.
4.21      In implementing the above program, particular attention will be paid
to the need to integrate the work with that of a strengthened city adminis-
tration. There would, however, be a shift away from the present emphasis on
static and restrictive land use planning, or zoning, towards a more compre-
hensive and continuous planning process that would focus on development
policies, socio-economic objectives, and resource constraints, and with less
spatial detail. The development plans would be closely linked to the national
five-year plans, and the first development plan would be prepared in time for
the Government's mid-term review of the Third Malaysia Plan, in mid-1978.
V. EVALUATION AND MONITORING
A. Transport
5.01      The proposed project is a logical continuation of the two previous
Bank-financed transport pirojects in the Kuala Lumpur area in that it provides



- 24 -
roads to collect and disperse interregional traffic (see Map 1). Its over-
riding objective, however, is to increase the efficiency of the metropolitan
transport system. As the "output" of a road network depends on (inter
alia) the number of passengers (or freight units) that it can accommodate,
and their speed 1/, this overriding objective is expressed operationally
in the form of measures of increases in vehicle occupancy and speed by 1980
and 1985. Vehicle occupancy, defined as the average number of passengers
per passenger car unit (pcu) 2/ is to be raised 20% by 1980 (30% by 1985),
in the peak periods, by increasing both the propprtion of buses in the traf-
fic stream and the average occupancy of private cars. In view of the con-
gested conditions in buses under present day conditions, it is however
intended that the present levels of bus occupancy, in peak periods, will be
reduced by 6%. Average door-to-door speeds of public transport trips are
to be raised 20X by 1980, and a further 10% by 1985. There is to be a
drastic reduction In passenger waiting times at sub-stops: the proportion
of buses in peak periods failing to clear waiting queues is to be reduced
from an estimated 30% in 1975 to less than 10% by 1980 and to less than 7%
by 1985. Specific objectives are set for peak period travel to and from
the city center: these call for a 10% modal shift by 1980 (15% by 1985)
of trips from non-bus to bus travel through a cordon round the central area
during peak periods. The above targets are detailed in Annexes 9 and 10.
They were agreed upon during negotiations.
5.02      It is estimated that the project would increase the cost effect-
iveness of the transport system by about 20% by 1980 and by a further 8%
by 1985.  As a result, it is expected that earli-er projected transport
investments will be substantially reduced. As originally conceived, the
project would have formed the first stage of an M$700 million (US$280 mil-
lion) (1973 prices) road investment program for the Kuala Lumpur area through
1990 (see Para. 2.19). According to tentative estimates, it is expected
that the increased cost effectiveness would enable the Government to reduce
the cost of the program to about M$250 million (US$100 million).
Evaluation Methodology
5.03      There is no commonly acceptable methodology for evaluating the
benefits from improving congested urban transport facilities. The pro-
cedure adopted in this case consisted of three evaluation stages:
(a) An estimation of the likely overall effects of the "Policy
and Traffic Engineering" measures (area road pricing; HOV
priorities; improvements in traffic engineering and control;
minor intersection improvements), compared to the "do nothing"
situation (continuation of present policies; existing road
network with committed improvements).
1/   See Urban Transport Sector Policy Paper, Annex 5, p. 72.
2/   Different types of vehicles use different amounts of road network
capacity; their relative utilization of capacity is expressed in
"passenger car units" or "pcu".



- 25 -
(b)  An estimation of the likely overall effects of adding to
the "Policy and Traffic Engineering Measures" all the pro-
posed increases in road capacity (the Southern Middle
Ring Road, Swettenham Parkway, Inner Ring Road and Pudu
Busway).
(c)  An estimation of the likely effects of each of the above
additions to road capacity, taken separately.
5.04      The method adopted in stages (a) and (b) was to measure basic
travel characteristics on the road network in its present, unimproved,
state, and to predict likely patterns of speeds and flows in the design
year, both "with" and "without," the proposed project. On the basis of
known relationships between traffic speeds and flows, and by assuming
stable daily travel times for individuals and for vehicles, an assessment
was made of the likely decline in the number of journeys in the study
area in the absence of the project, and of likely increases in the event
that, (a) the policy and traffic engineering measures, and (b) the
complete project, were implemented (see Table 1, Annex 16). For the
evaluation of the individual components in stage (c) a conventional com-
puter simulation was used to distribute on the road network the total traf-
fic volumes predicted for stage (b). For the computer simulation it was
assumed that inclusion or exclusion of any network link would have no
effect on the numbers, origins or destinations of journeys, nor on their
mode, but only on the distribution of traffic flows and speeds on the road
network. The differences in speeds were the basis of the calculation of
economic benefits, as savings in both vehicle operating costs and time are
closely related to changes in speeds. The model outputs were then adjusted
to allow for the effects of generated traffic, both positive and negative.
Time savings were valued at 1.1 times average hourly wage rates of travellers
in the study area for journeys made in the course of work, and at one-third
of average wage rates for other journeys.
5.05      On the basis of these assumptions, the benefits in the first year
after the completion of the project (1980) are expected to total M$43.3

The actual benefits to LOVs subject to the area road pricing charge would be
reduced (from M$14.4 million to M$11.4 million) by the license fees paid to
City Hall, estimated at M$3 million by 1980. An indeterminate, but substan-
tial, proportion of these benefits is likely to be passed on to non-road
users in consequence of the stimulation of employment and trade, and of land
use changes (see para. 5.09), resulting from more efficient transport. If
benefits after 1980 are assumed to grow in proportion to the increases in
motorization, conservatively assumed to be 5% per year, the economic rate
of return for the complete transport component is calculated to be 31%, and
the first year return 28%. If non-working time was valued at only one sixth
of average wage rates, the economic rate of return would drop to 22%. If
only benefits to public transport are considered, the economic rate of
return would be 17% and the first year return 13%.
5.06      Time savings account for 73% of project benefits.  There is strong
evidence that the time thus saved is more likely to be used for additional
trips, under less congested conditions, than for other purposes. The improve-
ment of public transport, and particularly the reductions in public transport
journey times, are expected to raise per capita public transport trips in 1980
by 36 percent, from an average of 3.7 trips per week without the project to
5.0 per week with it. Private car trips per capita would be raised by 3
percent.
Policy Changes and Traffic Engineering Improvements
5.07      The main effects of the policy and traffic engineering improve-
ments described in paras. 3.04-3.08, 3.11, Annexes 6, 7, are expected to
be: an increase in bus speeds; an increase in the number of bus passenger
trips, resulting both from a shift from private to public transport and
from additional trips to be made by existing bus travellers due to improved
conditions; and an increase in the speed of private traffic due to the
traffic engineering measures and to area road pricing, which will shift
traffic from more, to less, congested conditions. The positive effects
on private transport might be offset by LOVs having to give away to HOVs
at some "pinch-points", but experience from other cities indicates that
well-designed HOV priority schemes do not necessarily reduce the overall
speed of LOVs. The costs of these measures are mainly those of intersec-
'tion improvements; traffic circulation improvements and HOV priority
schemes; area road pricing; and project monitoring. These measures are
expected to give a first year return of 41 percent and an economic return
of 46 percent. Benefits to LOV traffic from area road pricing were ex-
cluded from the calculation because of insufficient information for the
assessment of gains and losses made by different groups. Charges paid
under the area road pricing scheme are considered to be neither benefits
nor losses, but transfers within the community.
Road Improvement Components
5.08      The main purpose of the ring roads is to enable through-traffic
to avoid the congested center of Kuala Lumpur. The Inner Ring Road (Map
2) is designed to become by 1980 the boundary of an expanded road pricing



- 27 -
area, and an "escape route" to enable traffic to avoid the priced area.
The improvement (which is described in Annex 5, Paras. 20-21) would involve
relatively minor roadworks and is expected to show correspondingly high
rates of return, approximating 30 percent for the first year, which re-
flects the high proportion of traffic (about 50%) which currently enters
the central area only for the purpose of going through it. The Sq'ithern
Middle Ring Road (SMMR) and the Swettenham Parkway (Map 1) will complete
the Middle Ring and enable traffic from Federal Routes I and II to avoid
the urban area. The most expensive element of this ring is the portion of
the SMRR between Jalan Travers and Jalan Sungai Besi which includes an
elevated section over the main railway line to Klang. Provision of this
section is necessary to relieve the difficult traffic conditions that
already prevail at the road junctions in the southwest of the urban area.
The economic rates of return for these two sections are 21 percent and 35
percent respectively, and the first year rates of return 18 and 23 percent
respectively. The Pudu busway (Maps 1, 2) is a link, partly on the right-
of-way of an existing railway line, giving direct access from the priority
bus lanes on the Seremban Expressway to the Pudu road bus station, both of
which are now under construction. The cost of the Pudu busway would be
about M$2 million, the economic rate of return 37 percent, and the first
year rate of return 32 percent.
Effect on Land Use
5.09      The project will discourage LOV travel in peak periods and in
congested areas. To the extent that more journeys to work are made in buses
and car-pools, there will be an increased availability of private cars to
family members other than the main bread-winner. This is likely to lead
to an increase in car trips to less congested areas and/or to the central
area in less congested periods. Completion of the Middle Ring Road,
coupled with pricing restraints in the central area, could lead toward
development of new employment and shopping centers in peripheral areas,
with the more specialized activities being concentrated in the city center.
These developments are generally expected to be beneficial, but their
effects cannot be quantified. Increased powers to control land use may be
necessary to avoid wasteful suburban spread, and the project provides for
a strengthening of land use planning the Federal Territory, (Paras 4.19-
4.21).
Risk and Uncertainty
5.10      The policies to be undertaken as part of this project are similar
in some respects to those pioneered in Singapore, but are otherwise un-
tried in the LDCs. Some elements, for example area road pricing, have not
been tried even in developed countries. There are political risks: for
example the measures might be unpopular, and unenforceable, if LOV traffic
is restrained without corresponding improvement in the existing inadequate
public transport system. To minimize risks of this kind, project imple-
mentation is to be carefully planned, with particular attention being given
to the improvement of public transport services (see Annex 14). Minibus
services have already been introduced and the Government has agreed to



- 28 -
approve as many applications to operate public transport vehicles as may
be necessary to ensure that sufficient buses are available for the imple-
mentation of the project's objectives (Para 3.04).
5.11      There is also a risk that the prices charged under the area road
pricing scheme might not be consistent with the objective of maximizing
the "output" of the road system: a price set too low would have no appre-
ciable effect, and a price set too high could result in too much traffic
being forced out of the central area to the detriment of traffic outside
and of trade inside. The Government proposes to monitor traffic develop-
ments carefully, with Bank assistance, and to modify as necessary bus
frequencies and routings, schedules and fares, HOV priorities, charges
under the area road pricing scheme and parking charges. Furthermore, the
road components included in the project form only the first stage of a
long-term investment program, and subsequent stages could be changed if
the policy measures bring about unexpected results.
B. Sites and Services
Relocation Aspects
5.12      The most immediate benefits of the sites and services component
are the advantages it offers for relocation of squatters displaced through
development projects, compared with the approach traditionally used in
Kuala Lumpur. Squatter households have in the past been moved on an in-
dividual basis into subsidized high-cost public housing, usually far away
both from the work places of the household members and from other house-
holds in the squatter community. Squatter businesses have been relocated
on a similar ad hoc basis, resulting in the break-up of the mini-economies
that are typical for squatter communities, with well developed backward and
forward economic linkages. Loss of jobs and income has followed. The pro-
posed project will provide for the relocation of all displaced families and
businesses only a short distance (an average of 2 miles).
5.13      The businesses will be moved according to a program aimed at mini-
mizing the disruption of their activities. The sites and services at the
new location have been designed to eliminate the constraints that have
prevented these businesses from implementing the expansion plans many of
them have. The lack of tenure, the size of the plots, and insufficient
public services, have in the past been major constraints. The long-term
employment generation effect of the project will therefore be substantial
(about 1,000 jobs).
Area Development Aspects
5.14      The project area for the first two phases is strategically located
mainly along Jalan Sungai Besi and in Salak South (see Maps 1 and 3). It is
being opened up for development through new road construction, particularly
through the Second Highway Project. The proposed project will help realize



- 29 -
the development potential of the area by providing new sites and services
for industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential purposes, and
through upgrading of squatter areas. Most important, the project will help
ensure that a large portion of the benefits of this development will accrue
to the low-income population already squatting in the area. These squatter
households and businesses would, in the absence of the project, have been
removed elsewhere.
Low Cost Settlement Aspects
5.15      The proposed project not only deals with the relocation of squat-
ters and the capturing of the development potential of the area in an ef-
ficient and socially desirable manner. It also incorporates key elements
of the new housing policy being considered by the Government, such as
efficient site planning, appropriate design standards, self-help housing
construction, full cost recovery, and employment generation. It is viewed
by the Government and City Hall as a pilot scheme where these key elements
will be tested. City Hall has waived existing building regulations in
favor of performance design standards related to security aspects and to
fire and health hazards, resulting in substantial cost reductions.  The
cost per household is about a third of the cost of City Hall's traditional
public housing schemes.
5.16      Objectives have been established and performance indicators
defined for monitoring and evaluation of the project component in order to
help develop the housing policy and to help prepare guidelines for its im-
plementation. The key performance indicators are discussed in Annex 9.
Annex 10 is a list of the indicators and the targets and agreement was
reached with City Hall and UDA during negotiations on this list.
Economic Rates of Return
5.17      The economic rates of return were estimated for the first two
phases. They average 23%. They are 13% for new residential sites and services
and 26% for squatter area upgrading. As in previous Bank-financed sites and
services projects, the benefits are measured primarily on the basis of imputed
rental values. A 20% cost increase would reduce the average rate of return
to 19%. The methodology used in estimating the rates of return is outlined
in Annex 16.
VI. RECOMMENDATIONS
6.01      The following main assurances were obtained during negotiations:
(a) the Government will gradually over four years, 1976-79, phase
out the bus seat tax (para. 3.04);
(b) the Government will annually review and adjust as necessary
the structure and levels of bus and minibus fares to permit
services to be provided on a commercial basis (para. 3.04);



- 30 -
(c) the Government will issue licenses to operate public trans-
port vehicles in sufficient number to enable the project
objectives to be achieved (para. 3.04);
(d) the Government and City Hall will implement HOV lanes,
routes and priorities as part of the project to form
a network of Designated HOV Routes (para. 3.06);
(e)  the Government and City Hall will introduce area road
pricing by July 1, 1977 (para. 3.08);
(f)  the Government and City Hall will place the cash surplus
from the sites and services component in a revolving fund
to be used exclusively to finance future sites and services
and squatter area upgrading projects (para. 3.22);
(g)  with regard to planning in the Federal Territory (para.
4 . 20),
Mi) the Government will, together with City Hall, by
July 1, 1976 establish a task force to carry out
development policy analysis, broad spatial planning,
capital programming and project reviews;
(ii) the Government will by September 1, 1976 prepare
a two-year work program for the task force;
(iii)  the Government will prepare recommendations on an
institutional framework and processes suitable over
the longer term for the continuation of the task
force's work and for decision-making; and
(iv) the task force, or the long-term institutional
framework, will by January 1, 1978 prepare a ten-
year spatial development plan and a five-year
capital budget; and
(h) the Government, City Hall and UDA will monitor the achieve-
ment of the project objectives with regard to key performance
indicators (paras 3.28, 5.01 and 5.16).
6.02      With the assurances received, the project is suitable for a Bank
loan of US$26 million for a term of 25 years including a grace period of
5 years for repayment of the principal.

M?AAYS IA
SECOND KUATA L[PUR URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Bus Operations in the Kuala Lumpur Metropolitan Area
1.        There are eight private bus companies operating a total of about 715
buses in Kuala Lumpur. There are no public bus companies. Bus operations
are very efficient. The bus companies are surviving without public sub-
sidies In spite of heavy taxes and one of the lowest bus fares in the world:
MO4 (USil.6) per mile from 1953 to early 1975, and now MJ5 (US42.0) per
mile. As a comparison, the fares charged by the public bus company in Istan-
bul average USJ9 per mile which barely covers personnel costs.
2.        However, bus service is poor in Kuala Lumpur, and has been de-
teriorating. Buses are overcrowded and service is infrequent outside the
peak period. The bus companies have been forced to let the service de-
teriorate, due to their precarious finances. Buses have not been replaced
as required and there has been no expansion of the bus fleet over the last
five years.
3.        The policy measures being introduced as part of the proposed proj-
ect will reverse the trend:
(a) bus fares were increased by 25%, to MJ5 per mile in
April 1975;
(b) the seat tax will be abolished; the tax now accounts
for more than 10% of annual expenditures of the bus
companies;
(c) average bus speeds are expected to increase by at least
30% over the next four years as a result of the HOV lanes
and priorities that are part of the project; this will
increase revenues per bus by the same percentage while
expenditures will only increase by 5 to 8%;
(d) routes and schedules are being revised with the assistance
of consultants, to provide better area coverage and more
frequent service; and
(e) the newly established Highway Planning and Public Transport
Unit will (i) through its public transport service inspectors
ensure that bus routes, schedules, and other service standards
are satisfactory, and (ii) with the assistance of advisers pro-
vided under the project give training and managemiient advice
\to the bus companies.



ANNEX 2

4.        The remainder of the annex gives a brief description of present
bus operations.
The Bus Companies
5.        One of the eight companies is dominating, Sri Jaya.  It accounts
for close to half of all bus passenger trips (see Table 1). It had British
management until 1970 and is now the only bus company manned for the most
part by Malays. The other companies are mainly Chinese. Largest among
them is Toong Fong, with close to 20% of all passenger trips.
The Buses
6.        Table 2 shows the age and seating characteristics of the bus
fleet. The average age is 8.6 years and average number of seats is 42. The
distribution of seating capacity is:
Seats per bus             Number of buses           Percent of buses
16-18                           6                          1

40-42                         179                          25
43-44                         431                          60

Total:          715                         100
7.        An average of one standing passenger per every three seats is
permitted by vehicle regulations. However, 40% of the buses are not li-
censed to carry standing passengers and others are licensed for less than
the maximum:

Actual licensed:                             30,199      5,736       35,935
8.        The total capital cost to the bus company is M$44,000 to M$48,000
(US$18,000-19,000) for 43-44 seat buses and slightly over M$50,000 (US$20,000)
for 48-49 seat vehicles. The buses are assembled locally from imported chas-
si components and locally built bodies. Because of the difference in duties,
the chassis are imported completely knocked-down and assembled by local
companies. The entire bodywork is done locally, using local materials and
labor. Several firms manufacture bus bodies, and Sri Jaya has recently be-
gun body construction in its own work shops. Plans and specifications for
buses require approval of the engineering section of the Road Transport De-
partment to ensure compliance with safety and performance standards. Chas-
sis are purchased generally from British and European manufacturers (1973
data):

Routes and Schedules
9.        The buses operate as normal stage buses along designated routes
and with established schedules and stops. Enforcement is virtually non-
existent. However, scheduling is not up to date and on most routes more
buses are operated than the schedules call for, an average of about 10%
more between 6 a.m. and 9 p.m. The route structure is also out of date.
Schedules and routes are being revised (para 3). Overloading is common
and there are buses with 70 passengers. Much of the overloading is due to
"bunching" caused by traffic congestion.
10.       The peaks are longer and flatter in Kuala Lumpur than in most
other cities. The following table shows the number of buses and passengers
passing through a central area cordon, roughly following the Inner Ring
Road, on a typical weekday in April 1973 (by half hour in the three peak
periods):

Finances
11.       Table 3 summarizes the financial and operating results of all 8
bus companies for the 12 months prior to March 31, 1973. It should be noted
that all companies experienced substantial wage increases in the latter part
of 1973, and fuel cost increases in 1974.
12.       Total operating income was about M$2.6 million, or 8% of operating
revenues. Total income before income taxes was M$3.3 million, representing
a return of about 8% on a capital stock roughly estimated at M$40.2 million:

SECOND KUALA LUMPUR URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Minibus Operations
1.        In March 1975, the Government decided to introduce minibus services
in the Kuala Lumpur metropolitan area and license applications were invited.
About 1,000 applications were received to operate a total of about 2,200
vehicles. By the end of 1975, about 100 minibuses were on the road. The
program envisages some 500 mini-buses by mid-1976.
The Buses
2.        The buses have a seating capacity of 14-16 persons.  Standing
passengers are not allowed. Their pcu-rating is only 1.5, i.e., they use
only 50% more road network capacity than an average sized private car.
3.        A standard color is required for the buses.  The display of
route numbers of a size recognizable from a distance of 50 yards is mandatory
(about 12 inches high).
4.        Minibuses are assembled and readily available in Peninsular
Malaysia. Bodywork is done locally. They are used as school buses in Kuala
Lumpur. The price of a typical minibus is M$32,060 (US$13,000) on the road.
The Routes
5.        Twenty-eight routes have been defined, all of which have one
terminal point on each side of the city and pass through the central area.
At each terminal, the passengers will have a choice between at least two
different routes through the central area in order to reduce walking distance.
The routes have simply been allocated on the basis of population densities,
with the trip demand along each route expected to be the same. The alloca-
tion will be reviewed and adjusted on the basis of monitoring results.
The length of the routes vary from 11 to 14 miles, with an average length
of 12.4 miles.
The Speeds
6.        Test driving of the routes indicates average terminal to terminal
speeds of 15 m.p.h., giving average terminal to terminal trip times of
about 50 minutes. A total daily mileage of about 275, or 18 trips, are pos-
sible initially. It is expected that the introduction of HOV priorities and
other policy measures will increase average speeds to at least 20 m.p.h.
by 1980, resulting in average trip times of about 35 minutes and substantially
increased revenues to the operators (see para 14).



ANNEX 3
Page 2
The Fare
7.        The fare is a fixed Mi4O per trip, independently of trip length.
It will be reviewed after some experience of the operations has been gained.
Simplicity of the fare structure is a common characteristic of minibuses
all over the world and contributes to their efficiency. They always
operate without official conductors.
8.        The average trip length in Kuala Lumpur is about four miles.  Public
transport charges for a four mile trip are:
Stage bus:          M$0.20
Minibus:            M$0.40
Taxi:               M$1.60
9.        The flat minibus fare of MA4O is reasonable in the initial stage.
It ensures the operators satisfactory revenues (see para 14). However,
the short-distance passenger clearly subsidizes the long-distance pas-
senger. This will be considered when the fare is reviewed. Three possible
modifications are under discussion: (a) only a maximum fare will be
prescribed, leaving it to each operator to develop a fare structure below
the maximum which suits his particular demand pattern; (b) a simple stage
fare with only two or three stages will be prescribed; and (c) no fare will
be prescribed. The last alternative is unlikely to be implemented.
Operating Characteristics
10.       The minibuses are allowed to pick up and set down passengers by
the kerbside wherever possible along their routes. The ability to hail a
minibus is an essential operating characteristic. The same stopping
restrictions as apply to taxis will initially also apply to minibuses.
Additional restrictions may be imposed after some experience of the mini-
buses has been gained, particularly as regards the central city area.
11.       The minibuses are required to adhere to their designated routes
between the two terminals so that the traveling public always know where
to find the minibus. However, the operators are permitted to ply for hire
around the terminals.
12.       No shelters or other facilities will be provided at the terminals
or along the routes until the operations settle down. Experience elsewhere
has shown that stands or shelters initially provided for minibus passengers
were often not used. The operator himself quickly finds out the locations
best suited for maximum passenger attraction.
Demand
13.       It is estimated that there is an "instant" demand for about 60,000
daily passenger trips by minibus, given the routes, the fares, and the



ANNEX 3
Page 3
operating characteristics. Each minibus will initially handle about 200 daily
passenger trips. A total of 300 minibuses could therefore be introduced
immediately. The demand is expected to triple within one year. It is
conservatively estimated that minibuses will handle about 8% of peak hour
trips and 6% of all trips by 1980.
Revenues and Expenditures
14.       Table 1 shows the financial picture for a typical minibus.  The
surplus of revenues over expenditures is expected to be about M$8,000
(US$3,200) per year initially. With the HOV speed increases expected
under the proposed project, the surplus could double assuming that every-
-thing else remains constant.
15.       The profitability of minibus operations is expected to attract
a large number of operators, helping to achieve the project objective of
a modal shift to more economical forms of transport. The Highway Planning
and Public Transport Unit will monitor the performance of minibus operations,
and will make appropriate recommendations for changes in routes, fares, and
availability of licenses.

SECOND KUALA LUMPUR URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Parking
1.        This annex describes parking in Kuala Lumpur in 1974, prior to
the increases in parking rates under the proposed project (para 3.07).
Supply
2.        The total supply of kerb (on-street) and off-street parking spaces
in the core and fringe areas has been determined by field surveys. The
distinction made between kerb and off-street facilities is somewhat arbi-
trary and kerb facilities have been designated as those parking spaces exist-
ing along streets which are utilized for the principal purpose of traffic
movement. This distinction is important because the majority of parking
spaces in the Kuala Lumpur core area exist in back lanes or alleys, and in
discontinuous streets which are devoted mainly to parking and cater for
very little traffic movement. Very few off-street parking lots have been
developed or improved and most parking facilities simply utilitize ground
areas not occupied by buildings.
3.        A total of 5,695 spaces exist Is the entire survey area of which
3,125 are located in the core and 2,570 in the fringe zones:

ANNEX 4
Page 2
4.        Of the 1,186 private spaces in the core area, only 832 are availa-
ble for the public. The 222 on-street spaces for bus stops, loading zones,
and taxi stands are all permanently occupied for these purposes. Of 670
off-street lot spaces, 132 are permanently used for taxis.
Rates
5.        The rates charged for parking in public kerb and off-street fa-
cilities in the core and fringe areas are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.
Both kerb and off-street facilities have been included in these summary tables
since City Hall controls these spaces by parking attendants and applies the
same hourly rates to both in a manner identical to the operation of commer-
cial off-street parking lots or garages. Parking meters were at one time
installed for this purpose but subsequently removed in favor of the more
flexible and efficient control by attendants. Vandalism was the chief reason
for removal of the meters. Kerb parking facilities do not limit parking
periods (as meters usually do), and patrons may pay parking charges at the time
of parking, when returning to their car, or at a later time at booths maintained
about the city, whichever is most convenient.
6.        The rate tables indicate that of the 1,552 core area spaces where
parking charges are imposed, more than 80% or 1,250 have a charge of NW30
for the first hour. The average charge for the first hour of parking in
all commercial spaces in the core area is Mi29 while the average for two
hours is MW69, M$1.09 for three hours, and progressing up to M$2.74 for
all-day or eight hours parking.
7.        This compares with the average charge in the fringe area for the
first hour of MN17; MJ43 for two hours, M479 for three hours and progressing
up to M$2.28 for eight hours or more. It is also noted that 258 spaces in
the fringe area have no charge for the first hour of parking but impose
charges for subsequent hours. Thus while graduated rate scales are not
generally applied in parking facilities, the rates selected usually favor
and encourage short-term parking.
8.        Monthly parking is available in 387 spaces in the core area with
rates ranging from M$18 to M$30 per month and averaging M$22. In the
fringe area, 815 spaces are available at an average monthly rate of
M$19.18. Charges range from M$10 to M$30 with M$18 and M$30 being the most
common:

Turnover
9.        In the core area, the average turnover is about 6.4 vehicles per
space per day, indicating near maximum possible utilization of available
parking spaces - both legal and illegal.
Trip Purpose and Parking Duration
10.       The trip purpose of parkers utilizing facilities in the core has
been determined for: shopping, business, work and other. Twenty-four
percent of the trips are for "shopping" with an additional 41% for "business".
Work trips amounted to 20% while other parkers accounted for 15% of the
total: 1/

11.       The average duration of parking for all trip purposes was 1 hr
23 mins.  More than 70% of all parkers in the core area park for periods
of one hour or less, which is a reflection of the high turnover results
presented earlier.
Accumulation of Parked Vehicles
12.       The following table shows the accumulation profile in the core
area for a typical week-day, indicating a peak between 11 a.m. and noon
when 90% of the spaces were filled (on Saturdays a peak of 96% was reached
at 10 a.m.):

14.       The rates include costs of construction (depreciation), land,
interest, operating costs inclusive of profit (10% of invested capital),
and property and income taxes. The cost differences between public and
private ownership are due to the fact that public agencies do not pay
property or corporate income taxes, and are able to obtain low cost loans
from the Federal Government.
15.       Assumptions about space utilization and revenues are based on the
market characteristics presented above (paras 2-12), adjusted for a reduc-
tion in demand due to the higher rates.

MALAYSIA
SECOND KUALA LUMPUR URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
New Roads and Road Improvements
1.        This annex contains a description of each road component of the
project, as listed in the cost table, para. 3.14. Design standards are in
Annex 11.
Southern Middle Ring Road (Project Component A.1)
2.        The SMRR will extend from Jalan Parlimen to Jalan Sungai Besi
and will form, together with Swettenham Parkway (see paras 9-11), Jalan
Sungai Besi and Jalan Pekeliling, the proposed Middle Ring Road. The total
length of the SMRR is 4.3 miles, of which 3.1 miles will consist of new
roads and 1.2 miles of improved roads. The total cost is M$24.9 million
(US$10.0 million).
3.        A grade-separated interchange, the Jalan Parlimen Interchange,
with 4 bridges, 5 ramps and 1 loop, will be built at the intersection with
Jalan Parlimen and Jalan Duta. From this interchange to Jalan Kebun Bunga,
dual 2-lane carriageways will be built, with the next link, to Jalan
Damansara, consisting of a single 2-lane carriageway. Grade-separation will
be provided at the intersection with both Jalan Kebun Bunga and Jalan Daman-
sara-- the Jalan Damansara Interchange. It will have a total of 3 bridges,
4 ramps and 2 loops.
4.        A bridge, the Jalan Brickfields Bridge, will carry the traffic
over the railway and Jalan Brickfields, with one ramp connecting to the
latter. From this point to the interchange at the Klang River and Jalan
Lornie, dual 2-lane carriageways will be built.
5.        The Jalan Lornie Interchange will consist of 1 bridge, carrying
the traffic over the river and Jalan Lornie, 3 ramps and 2 loops. A one-
lane spur will bring traffic from the interchange into the central area at
Jalan Birch, bypassing the congested area around City Hall, with 1 bridge
across Jalan Birch.
6.        From the Jalan Lornie Interchange, a single 2-lane carriageway
will be built to Jalan Kerayong, from where Jalan Kerayong and Jalan
Lapangan Terbang (Old Airport Road) will be improved. A single 2-lane
carriageway will be built from Jalan Lapangan Terbang to Jalan Sungai Besi,
with a small bridge across Sungai Pudu. A bridge will carry the traffic
over Jalan Sungai Besi to Jalan Chan Sow Lin.
7.        The following table shows the cost of construction and land (M$ mil-
lion):

Earth- and roadworks                        12.307
Total construction cost        23.200
8.        The total cost of the SMRR has been reduced by about 50% compared
to the original proposal. The Government decided to impose traffic restraint
measures that will reduce the projected traffic and which allowed sub-
stantial staging of the construction.
Swettenham Parkway (Component A.2.a)
9.        Swettenham Parkway will extend from the intersection of Jalan Ipoh
and Jalan Pekeliling, the Ipoh Interchange, to Jalan Parlimen, where it
joins the Southern Middle Ring Road. The total length is 1.7 miles, of
which 0.5 miles will consist of new roads and 1.2 miles of improved roads.
The total cost is M$6.5 million (US$2.6 million).
10.       The Ipoh Interchange will be constructed prior to the rest of
the Parkway, under a separate contract, and is described in para 12. From
this interchange to Jalan Kuching, dual 3-lane carriageways will be built
along the present alignment of Jalan Maxwell, with one bridge across Sungai
Batu. At Jalan Kuching, a grade-separated interchange will be built with
4 bridges and 4 ramps. From this interchange, a single 2-lane carriageway
will be built to the intersection of Jalan Carruthers and Jalan Swettenham
from where Jalan Swettenham will be improved to Jalan Parlimen. A bridge will
be built to carry Jalan Kenny traffic over the Parkway.

Earth- and roadworks               2.127
Total                     5.500
Ipoh Interchange (Component A.2.b)
12.       A bridge will be built to carry the circumferential traffic over
Jalan Ipoh with four ramps connecting to Jalan Ipoh, which is the main road
to the north (Federal Route I). Total cost is M$6.8 million (US$2.7 mil-
lion) of which M$0.3 million is for land, M$3.0 million for structures, and
the balance for earth- and roadworks.
Jalan Bangsar Improvements (Component A.3)
13.       The existing road will be widened from dual 2 lanes to dual 3
lanes by reducing the width of the median with provisions for HOV priorities.
Sidewalks will be provided on each side of the road and a bridge will be
built at Jalan Travers. The total length of the improved section is 1.7
miles. The cost estimates are as follows (M$ million):
Total cost:
Construction                       4.8
Land                               0.6

Jalan Lornie Improvements (Component A.4)
14.       Improvement of Jalan Lornie up to a point about 1.3 miles from
City Hall is part of the first Kuala Lumpur Urban Transport Project (Loan
851-MA). The remaining section will be improved under the proposed project.
The portion up to the Jalan Lornie Interchange (para 5) will be widened
from dual 2 lanes to dual 3 lanes, with provision for HOV priorities, while
the link from the interchange to City Hall will continue to be dual 2 lanes.
Total cost is estimated at M$4.7 million (US$1.9 million) of which M$0.8
million is for land.
Jalan Chan Sow Lin Improvements (Component A.5)
15.       Jalan Chan Sow Lin, which runs parallel to Jalan Sungai Besi,
will be improved and extended. It will provide a direct connection from
Seremban Expressway (now under construction as part of the Second Highway
Project, Loan 931-MA) to Jalan Pekeliling which it will join at Jalan
Cheras. The length is 1.3 miles. Total cost is estimated at i'$2.1 million
(US$0.8 million) of which M$O.2 million is for land.
Jalan Sungai Besi Improvements (Component A.6)
16.       Jalan Sungai Besi will be widened from dual 2 lanes to dual 3 lanes
from the end of Seremban Expressway to an extension of Jalan Pekeliling
now under construction, with the additional lanes reserved for HOVs. The
total length is about 1.5 miles. Jalan Sungai Besi will pass under Jalan
Loke Yew which requires 3 bridges. A pedestrian bridge will also be part
of the Jalan Loke Yew Interchange. The cost estimates are as follows
(G$ million):
Total cost:
Construction                       4.0
Land                               0.1
Total                     4.1
Breakdown of construction cost:
Jalan Loke Yew interchange         1.000
Earth- and roadworks               3.000
Total                     4.000
Pudu Busway (Component A.7)
17.       A 2-lane busway will be built from the Jalan Pudu bus station to
Jalan Sungai Besi, a distance of about 1.2 miles. Existing railway right-
of-way will be used most of the way. Total cost is estimated at M$1.4
million (US$0.6 million) of which M$0.2 million is for land.



ANNEX 5

HOV Facilities along Federal Highway I (Component A.8)
18.       The reserved HOV lanes along Jalan Sungai Besi (para 16) will be
continued outwards along Seremban Expressway (Highway I) as required to
minimize traffic delays to HOVs. Special HOV facilities will be built at
key points along the Expressway for a total cost of about M$0.6 million
(US$0.2 million). They include:
(a) A HOV access lane at Sungai Besi village (Mile 7),
to give HOVs access priority over LOVs. Cost: M$11,000
(US$4,400);
(b) A new HOV-only interchange at Mile 6.25 to serve Kampong
Bahru. A HOV exit ramp and a HOV entry ramp are included.
Cost: M$283,000 (US$113,000). No access to/exit from
the Expressway was envisaged at this point in the original
design of the Expressway. With the proposed change,
people traveling by EOV will be able to use the new
Expressway whereas LOV traffic will have to continue
to use existing small roads for travel to and from Kuala
Lumpur;
(c) A HOV access lane to give HOVs coming from Jalan Kuchai
Lama priority over LOVs when entering the Expressway.
Cost: M$38,500 (US$15,400);
(d) A HOV access lane to give HOVs coming from Salak Road
priority over LOVs when entering the Expressway.
Cost: M$24,200 (US$9,700);
(e) A HOV access lane to give HOVe conlag from Jalan Sungai
Besi priority over LOVs when entering Salak Road.
Cost: M$22,000 (US$8,800); and
(f) Bus stops. Six bus bays will be built along the Express-
way, at an average cost of M$22,000 (US$8,800).
HOV Facilities along Federal Highway II (Component A.9)
19.       For the HOV facilities along Federal Highway II the same principles
as for Highway I will be followed and the costs are estimated at M$0.6 million
(US$0.2 million).
Imner Ring Road Improvements (Component A.10)
20.       The Inner Ring Road would consist of Jalans Birch, Shaw, Imbi,
Sultan Ismail, Ampang, Campbell/Stony, Raja Laut/Raja Abdullah, Kuching, and
Kinabalu. It is proposed that it forms the boundary of the priced area in
a second phase of the area road pricing scheme (Annex 7).



ANNEX 5
Page 6
21.       The improvement works included in the project would cover Jalans
Shaw, Imbi, Sultan Ismail, Raja Laut/Raja Abdullah, Campbell and Stony.
The present two-lane roads will be widened to four lanes (40 ft carriageway)
with footpaths on both sides. The layout of intersections will be improved
to enable them to carry as much traffic as the roads leading in to them,
and nine of them will be provided with traffic signals. Between Jalans
Ampang and Raja Abdullah a new link will be built, including two bridges.
Studies now under way may show that instead of completing the Jalan
Stony link between Jalans Raja Abdullah and Raja Laut, it would be preferable
to provide such a link closer to Jalan Campbell, as an extension of Jalan
Sultan Ismail. The total length of the improvements is about 3.3 miles and
the total cost is estimated at M$17.7 million (US$6.7 million) of which M$4
million is for land (see Table 1 for details). The technical assistance
component also includes M$0.7 million (US$0.3 million) for feasibility and
engineering studies of a future direct connection from Jalan Raja Laut to
Jalan Kuching north of Jalan Campbell.

SECOND KUALA LU@UR URBM TRANSPORT PROJECT
Intersection Improvements , Circulation Plan,. and
BOV Priorities
1.        This annex contains a description of Project Components B.1, B.2
and B.3. Detailed cost estimates for B.1 and B.2 are in Table 1. The area
road pricing scheme for the central area is described in Annex 7.
2.        The components consist of (a) the improvement and rearrangement of
12 major and some minor intersections (see paras. 3-24), (b) the implementa-
tion of the central area circulation plan and the installation of an area
traffic-control system together with signaling equipment and signs (see
paras. 25-30), and the implementation of a four-year program of HOV priority
schemes (para. 31). The circulation plan and the location of nine of the
major intersection improvements are shown on Map 2. The location of three
of the intersection improvements is shown on Map 1.
Intersection Improvements
3.        (4) X  Gurney/PekelilinA, Jalan -  Gurney and Jalan Raja Muda
form a staggered signalized junction with Jalan Pekeliling. Despite recent
improvements the Junction is rapidly reaching capacity and at present re-
quires police supervision during peak periods. The existing right turns
onto Jalan Pekeliling require a short and dangerous weaving maneuver to be
made with the free flowing straight ahead traffic. There are significant
pedestrian movements in the vicinity of the junction. These movements are
made without the benefit of controlled pedestrian crossings and with inade-
quate or unpaved footpaths. The intersection improvement is required to
take account of a City Hall planned extension of Jalan Gurney south-westerly
to connect with the proposed Jalan Stoney extension.
4.        It is for this junction proposed to extend Jalan Raja Muda through
to Jalan Gurney and to allow for the widening and realignment of Jalan Gurney.
The three intersections so formed would be controlled by coordinated traffic
signals. The improvement will be carried out in two stages, the first stage
being the Immediate improvement required before construction of Jalan Gurney
extension, with the second stage allowing for the connection of the exten-
sion. The junction of Jalan Raja Muda and Pekeliling will operate at capa-
city in 1980. The Jalan Gurney/Jalan Pekeliling junction and the junction
of Jalan Gurney and Raja Muda extension will have a 1980 reserve capacity
in the order of 15% and 20% respectively.
1/   (4) is the identification number given to this intersection improvement
to the ronsultants' reports. It is also used on Maps 1 and 2.
2/   Jalan means street or road.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
5.        The first phase of the scheme necessitates the demolition of a
few old timber buildings, timber shophouses and stalls together with two
brick and concrete shophouses. The scheme requires the acquisition of
land mainly for the Jalan Raja Muda extension.
6.        (5) Gurney/Perumahan Gurney:  The existing facility is a four
way junction with no priority on the two side roads. At present the traf-
fic entering and leaving Perumahan Gurney, which includes buses, experi-
ences difficulty and long queues develop necessitating police control during
peak periods. There are high pedestrian movements in the area principally
to the Government buildings on the northeast side of the junction. There
are no road crossing facilities or paved footpaths in the area.
7.        The principal features of the improvement proposed for the inter-
section are:.
(a) installation of three-phase vehicle actuated traffic
signals with presence detectors and pedestrian indicators;
(b) widening of Jalan Gurney and Perumahan Gurney at the
junction to provide storage areas;
(c) provision of pedestrian crossing facilities and paved
footpaths;
(d) provision of bus lay-bys close to the junction; and
(e) provision of pedestrian access to the Government buildings
at the junction.
The latter two features will encourage pedestrians to use the signalized
crossings, resulting in substantially reduced accidents.
8.        Land acquisition is approximately 900 sq ft most of which is
required for the bus lay-by on the northeast side of Jalan Gurney. All
existing accesses are retained. The improvement will operate at capacity
in 1980.
9.        (6) Bulatan Raja Muda:  Bulatan 1/ Raja Muda controls traffic
entering from two major radial routes, Jalan Ipoh and Jalan Pahang, and
from a distributor road, Jalan Raja Muda. Approach widths and weaving
lengths in the roundabout are inadequate for the present traffic, causing
locking of the roundabout and long queues on the approaches.
10.       The roundabout will be replaced by a four way junction with free
flowing left turns. The junction will be controlled by three-phase vehicle
1/   Bulatan means roundabout.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
actuated traffic signals with presence detectors. The scheme will accom-
modate all existing turns with the exception of U turns and the right turns
from Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman and Jalan Raja Muda.
11.       Lanes will be reserved for the exclusive use of buses and high
occupancy vehicles on Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman and Jalan lpoh up to Jalan
Sentul Pasar. These lanes will form a continuation of the central area
HOV route.  Bus lay-bys will be provided from the BOV lanes at the junction
of Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman and Jalan Ipoh.
12.       The scheme also includes the provision og new traffic signal in-
stallations at the Jalan Chow Kit/Tuanke Abdul Rahua juntion and at thpe
junction of Jalan Raja Laut with Jalaxa lpoh. The 2rut of these junctioas
also serves as an inbound access point to the rOV lane.  The total of five
sets of traffic signals in the scheme would initially be linked to a local
controller and fitted with presence detectors for eentual linking to the
proposed central area master controller (pareo. 2729). Pedestrian indica-
tions and pedestrian crossing facilities arc provided at all th 
13.       (7) & (8) DamanearaiBrickfields/SulaimanO The two intersections
are not signalized at present. Right turn movements (south to east) are
not allowed either at Damansara or Bhilds.  This causes dead mileage

vated section of Jalan KinabElu0   he prosGe  obes efiutes this
maneuver by permitting acceas to Jalr Young only from the @entry rKp  from
Jalan Damansera.  In order to accommodate the necessary slip road to Jalan
Young and widen the weaving section of Jalen Kinabalu without taking laad
from Masjid Negara9 it is necessary to increase the horizoiatal radius of
curvature over this section and extend the Jalan Kinabalu embankent on
the east side. A central reserve safety barrier will also be installed.
16.       (10) & (11) Leboh Pasar Besar/Sultan Hishamuddin: This iLnter
section is one of the gateways to the Central Area0 The predominant flow
is along Jalans Sultan Hishamuddin and Raja in the north to south direc-
tion.  The south to east movement and vice versa along Hishamuddin and
Leboh Pasar Besar is also significant.  With the existing layout and



ANNEX 6
Page 4
phasing, not all approaches of this 4-way 3-phase intersection are utilized
to the same extent.
17.       The scheme will break down the present intersection into three
separate but closely spaced intersections. The south-east movement will be
taken around the back of the Selangor State PWD building. The right turn ap-
proach from Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin to Jalan Leboh Pasar Besar will be sited
back from Leboh Pasar Besar at a point where widening to accommodate add-
itional lanes is possible. This action at the same time will free a lane at
the main intersection to accommodate the north-south movement.
18.       At the Leboh Pasar Besar approach of the main intersection, through-
movement to Jalan Raja west and the right turn to Jalan Raja north will be
allowed. The through-movement will allow easier access to the government
building and the few public buildings along Jalan Raja, whilst the right
turn to Jalan Raja west will reduce dead mileage. The proposed improvement
will be adequate for predicted traffic growth to about 1980 before reaching
capacity in peak periods.
19.       (12) Cheng Lock/Tun Perak:  This scheme improves circulation
around the new Pudu bus terminal at the inner end of the proposed Pudu
Busway (Project Component A.7, see Annex 5). The signals at this junction
will be linked to the Central Area Master Controller (see paras 27-29).  Sig-
nalized pedestrian crossings will be provided. They will, together with
the two footbridges built as part of the new bus terminal, ensure ease of
pedestrian movements.
20.       (13) Campbell/Ampang:  This is a critical intersection along the
Inner Ring Road. Its improvements have been designed to correspond to the
proposed area road pricing scheme (see Annex 7). Signalization is included
for the Jalan Ampang intersection and for the Jalan Hale extension both at
Jalan Campbell and at Jalan Hang Jebat. Three-phase traffic signals with
coordinated operation are proposed along Jalan Ampang.  The design provides
for (a) dual turns from Jalan Campbell in both directions to Jalan Ampang,
(b) turns from the north-east on Jalan Ampang to the west on the Jalan
Hang Jebat extension, and (c) a free flowing left turn from the south on
Jalan Ampang to the west. Fully protected pedestrian crossings are in-
cluded.
21.       (14) Bunus/Ampang:  City Hall is currently extending Jalan Bunus
to connect with Jalan Ampang via a new bridge over Sungai 1/ Klang. The
proposed scheme provides for signalization and control of the intersection.
22.       (15) Sultan Ismail/Raja Chulan:  This junction is also along the
Innr Ring Road. It is not signalized now but priority is given to traf-
fic on Jalan Raja Chulan. It functions at capacity with about 3,000 vehicles
entering it in the peak hour. An offset in the alignment of Jalan Sultan
Ismail leads to a high percentage of righ turning movements, which causes
the junction to lock easily.
1/   Sungai means river.



ANNEX 6
Page 5
23.       The proposed scheme will correct the offset in Jalan Sultan
Ismail to give greater intersection control and ease congestion. Signali-
zation with three-phase operation will be provided, including pedestrian
protection.
24.       It is estimated that with the proposed improvements the intersec-
tion will reach capacity in 1980. Land immediately northeast and southwest
of the intersection will have to be acquired, involving an area of about
7,000 sq ft. When phasing the signals, provision will be made to link
this intersection with the others along Jalan Raja Chulan and Jalan Sultan
Ismail.
Area Traffic Control System
25.       Existing signalization system:  There are 58 signal controlled
intersections in the metropolitan area, almost all of which are located with-
in the area surrounded by the proposed Middle Ring Road defined as Jalan
Pekeliling, Loke Yew Viaduct 1/, Southern Middle Ring Road 2/, Swettenham
Parkway 3/ and Jalan Maxwell. Twenty-three of these signal installations are
located in the central area. They are linked to a master controller which
has a total capacity to serve 59 locations and generates three preset cycle
patterns over three time periods. It is inflexible in operation and cannot
respond to changes in traffic conditions but is simple and robust.
26.       Future system:  It is estimated that by 1990 one hundred and ten
locations in the metropolitan area would require signal installations of
which an estimated ninety-two might come under the direction of a master
controller and these would be largely within the Middle Ring Road area.
With ramp metering and other control measures to give HOVs priorities over
LOVs taken into account, the number of master controlled signal installa-
tions needed will probably be close to two hundred by 1990. Many new sig-
nals will be installed under the proposed project: (a) as part of the
junction improvements (paras 3-24); (b) as part of the new roads and road
improvements with HOV facilities (Annex 5); and (c) to implement the circu-
lation plan (see para 30).
27.       Master control of future system:  Three alternative equipment con-
figurations to handle a larger system and to help increase the capacity of
the road network were considered:
(a) time clock pattern selection with dial fixed time
coordinators (present system);
1/   Under construction.
2/   Project Component A.1.
3/   Project Component A.2.a.

(g)  Flexibility in timing

29.       The digital computer system has been selected and will be imple-
mented as part of the proposed project. Its flexibility and its extensive
capability to deal with the project's transport policy measures were de-
termining factors together with the recent reduction in the price of digital
computers through the development of mini-computers.
Circulation Plan
30.       The road and intersection improvements and the traffic signal
installations in the central area will all help to Implement an overall central
area traffic circulation plan which has been prepared (see Map 2). Alterna-
tive plans were evaluated on the basis of their cost and their effect on

vehicle and pedestrian flows. Particular emphasis was given to HOVs which
will be given extensive priorities.
HOV Priority Schemes
31.       A network of "Designated HOV Routes" has been defined (see Table 2).
Access priorities and separate routes or lanes for HOVs will be provided
along these routes as and when required to minimize traffic delays to HOVs
caused by LOVs. Road and intersection improvements included in the project
are designed to implement parts of the HOV route network. Equipment and
civil works to provide additional ROV priorities necessary along the Desig-
nated HOV Routes over the 1976-79 period are also included in the project,
at a cost of M$5.0 million (US$2.0'million). The two most urgent of these
HOV priority schemes are to provide access priorities and exclusive lanes
for HOVs along the heavily congested (a) Jalan Pudu between Jelan Pekeliling
and the central area (cost: M$500,000) and (b) Jalan Ipob, south of Jalan
Tun Ismail, and Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman, north of Jalan Campbell (cost:
M$600,000). These roads now have large flows of HOVs in mixed traffic.

SECOND KUALA LUMPUR URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Area Road Pricing
1.        This annex describes the area road pricing scheme to be imple-
mented as part of the traffic engineering and control component of the
proposed project (see para 3.11).
Main Features
2.        A cordon is defined around the central city area (the license
area) and LOVs are required to carry a license, normally purchased in ad-
vance (daily or monthly), to pass through the cordon during peak hours
(the license period). During the first phase (1976-1980), the scheme vill
be as follows (minor modifications may be made in the course of preparing
the detailed implementation program):
(a)  License area:             the core of the city (see Map 2).
(b)  License period:           7:00 - 9:30 a.m., with inclusion of the
evening peak under consideration.
(c)  Vehicles subject to      -Cars carrying less than 4 persons.
license:                 -Motorcycles carrying one person only;
to be included when the car-only system
has proved itself satisfactory.
-Taxis and vans and lorries to be included
if found desirable after introduction of
the scheme.
(d)  License price:            Cars:  M$2 a day or M$40 a month
Motorcycles (when included): M475 a
day or M$15 a month (charges subject to
revision after experience of the system
has been gained).
(e)  Enforcement:              Policed entry points, number plate
recording of illegal entrants and sub-
sequent prosecution; M$50 fine for
illegal entry.
(f)  License sales             Registrar of Motor Vehicles; post offices;
points:                   roadside sales booth (daily licenses only).



ANNEX 7
Page 2
The License Area
3.        The initial (1976-1980) license area (License Area 1) is indicated
on Map 2. It is defined through the main entry points:
1.  Jalan Petaling, as it leaves Bulatan Merdeka
2.  Jalan Sultan Mohamed, as it leaves Jalan Kinabalu
3.  Jalan Sultan Hishamuddin, off Jalan Kinabalu
4.  Jalan Tun Perak, at its junction with Jalan
Tuanku Abdul RahmAn and Jalan Raja.
5.   Jalan Raja, on the cross link from Jalan Raja Laut 1/
6.  Jalan Ampang, immediately to the south of its
junction with Jalan Campbell
7.  Jalan Weld, on the city side of the junction with
Persiaran Weld
8,9,10.   Jalan Tun Perak and Jalan Cheng Lock immediately beyond
the Pudu Roundabout; also Jalan Pudu Lama off Jalan
Pudu 2/
11. Jalan Davidson, on the city side of the junction with
Jalan Changkat Stadium.
4.        License Area 1 covers the inner core of the city.  By 1980, the
boundary of the license area would be extended to the Inner Ring Road within
which the whole city center is located (License Area 2). The ring road
is currently not well defined and will be improved under the proposed project
(Project Component A.10; see Annex 5). The improvements of the ring road
have been designed to make it a suitable boundary for the license area. By
initially separating the boundary from the ring road, interference between
road construction and the operation of the scheme is avoided. For the long
term, the Middle Ring Road may become the boundary, possibly with the Inner
Ring Road remaining the boundary of an inner license area with a higher
license price.
Traffic and the Choice of License Area
5.        The license area has been defined on the basis of both pragmatic
considerations (few entry points to police; availability of "escape" routes)
and traffic considerations. As only vehicles passing through the cordon
are charged, the cordon has been defined so as to capture the maximum number
of the vehicle trips causing traffic congestion. About 25% of all vehicle
trips made in the metropolitan area during the morning peak hours now pass
through the cordon of License Area 1 inbound, while about 35% pass through
the proposed cordon of License Area 2.
1/  Jalan Tuanku Abdul Rahman will become a HOV-only route.
2/   If allowance could be made for U-turning, a single entry point on
Jalan Pudu could replace these three. The Jalan Pudu Lama entry Point
would not be needed if Jalan Bukit Mahkaaah was closed at the Jalan
Raja Chulan end during the license period. These possibilities are
under review.



ANNEX 7
Page 3
6.        One of the characteristics of the traffic flows in Kuala Lumpur
is the large number of trips from one side of the city center to the other,
due to the pattern of land use. Most of these trips pass through the city
center rather than around, causing severe congestion. Excluding buses,
about 50Z of the vehicles passing through the cordon of License Area 1
during peak hours comprise through traffic, leaving the license area on the
other side. These vehicles, if they have less than 4 persons, will in the
future have to pay if they wish to pass through the congested central area.
7.        The measures to improve public transport now being implemented
are geared to meet the additional demand for public transport expected
with the introduction of area road pricing. The mini-buses (Annex 3) will
provide a high frequency and high quality service with good area coverage
and with all routes going into the license area.
Costs and Revenues
8.        Project costs to implement the scheme are estimated at about
M$500,000 (US$200,000) of which M$450,000 is for signs, gantry entrances,
and sale booths and M$50,000 is for publicity (printing of booklets, etc.).
Enforcement will cost approximately M$150,000 per year (11 entry points,
each requiring half-day shift of three police men). Maintenance of signs,
booths, etc. and printing and sales costs for licenses will amount to about
M$50,000 per year.
9.        Annual revenues will be about M$1.4 million (US$0.6 million)
based on estimated average sales of 2,700 monthly licenses and 200 daily
licenses.
The Singapore Scheme
10.       A scheme similar to the one proposed in Kuala Lumpur was intro-
duced in Singapore in June 1975. The effects on traffic flows and land use
pattern are closely followed by the Bank through its research program. In
designing the Kuala Lumpur scheme, the initial experience from Singapore
was taken into account.
11.       The most immediate and noticeable impact of the Singapore scheme
was on the number of vehicles entering the license area during the morning
peak. The number of cars fell by about 75% while other vehicles increased
by 25%, and the total number of vehicles dropped 35%. Traffic speeds within
the license area have increased substantially.
12.       The number of vehicles entering the license area just before and
after the license period has increased, as expected (the morning peak has
been spread out). The effect on the evening peak, which is not included
in the license period, has only been a 5% - 10% reduction in vehicle flows.
An extension of the license period in Kuala Lumpur to include the evening
peak is therefore under consideration.



ANNEX 7
Page 4
13.       The Singapore scheme includes a "park and ride" component which
has not been successful. Fifteen fringe car parks with about 10,000 spaces
were built immediately outside the restraint area at a total cost of about
M$7 million (US$2.8 million). A shuttle bus service was introduced to
provide high frequency and high quality transport from the car parks into
the license area (about 100 buses along some 10 routes). The park and ride
facilities have, however, been severely under-utilized. Only about 5% of
the parking spaces are occupied. The shuttle buses no longer operate
exclusively from the car parks but have extended their routes to residential
areas outside the license area. People prefer to leave their car at home,
where it can be used by other family members during the day, and to take
the bus all the way from home.
14.       Therefore, no fringe car parks are being built in Kuala Lumpur,
resulting in substantial cost savings and enabling an early introduction
of the scheme. Also, without the need for fringe car parks the pricing
scheme becomes more flexible. The license area can be changed easily, and
schemes with several tiers of license areas and prices become feasible.
15.       The license price in Singapore was originally S$3 (US$1.20) per day
or S$60 (US$24) per month. On January 1, 1976 the price was raised to S$4
(US$1.60) per day or S$80 (US$32) per month.

MALAYSIA
SECOND KUALA LUMPUR URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Sites and Services/Squatter Area Upgrading
1.        The component will be implemented in three phases.  This anzmx
outlines the first two phases (Phase 3 would provide for resettlement of
squatters displaced under the Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project). Phase 1 will
provide new sites and services for squatter households and businesses being
displaced by road construction projects in metropolitan Kuala Lumpur, most-
ly the Second Highway Project (Loan 931-MA; Contract IB3 for Ser.nban Ex-
pressway). These squatters are predominantly Chinese. Phase 2 will com-
prise (a) additional sites and services expected to attract Malays, and
(b) upgrading of squatter areas which (i) are located close to and are part
of the same community as the new sites, and (ii) are located alongside the
alignment of the new Seremban Expressway. See the following table:

2.        A detailed layout plan for Phase 1A (mainly residential) is shown
in Map 4 (the site layout and the number of plots have been modified slightly
since the map was prepared). Phase 2B (medium-sized industrial sites) is
located about 1 mile southwest of Phase 1A, west of Jalan Sungai Besi and
close to Seremban Expressway (see Map 3). Phase 2A (mainly residential)
is located about 2 miles west of Seremban Expressway (Map 3). Phase 2C
(agricultural) is mainly located around the Salak Road/Seremban Expressway
interchange (part of the Second Highway Project) (Map 3). Phase 2D (squatter
area upgrading) is located along the Seremban Expressway and Jalan Sungai
Besi, from Sungai Besi Village in the south to Jalan Loke Yew in the north
(Map 1 and 3).
3.        Detailed engineering plans and designs have been prepared and
costed for Phase 1. Cost estimates for Phase 2 are based on preliminary
engineering and on site and soil surveys of the Phase 2 areas. The estimates
are presented in Tables l and 2. Table 3 shows how the costs will be financed.
A. Phase 1 - Residential
Site Selection
4.        Phase 1 would almost exclusively address squatter households and
businesses that must be relocated as a result of the construction of Seremban
Expressway. A survey of all households and businesses within the road freeze
order zones has been carried out. Special attention was given to household
income, expenditure on housing and urban services, house and plot sizes,
place of work, transport, and the operations of squatter businesses. An
important result of the survey was that almost 40% of all households are
employed either in businesses close by, or in workshops in their own houses.
A further 30% work in Kuala Lumpur and use the bus service along Jalan Sungai
Besi. Principal site selection criteria for the new site were:
(a) minimum distance from the recipients' present
communities and workplaces;
(b) access to public transport, water supply and
electricity networks;
(c) adequate size parcel(s) of land to accommodate
immediate relocation needs, preferably government-
owned land unencumbered by squatters;
(d) land free from flooding and with low slopes and
adequate soil bearing capacity; and
(e) areas for market gardening businesses.



ANNEX 8
Page 3
5.        Suitable sites were found an average of only about 2 miles from the
present location of the squatters, next to Salak South New Village. The
area has many tin mines, for some of which the leases have expired and
the right to the land reverted to the Government. The sites for the proj-
ect are on such former tin mining land. The project fits into a longer
term development scheme which UDA is preparing for the area (see Map 3).
Design Standards
6.        Engineering standards are lower than those normally used in resi-
dential development in Kuala Lumpur, to enable costs to come within the abil-
ity of low-income households to pay. However, standards are adequate for the
intensity of use in the area and, in the case of roads, footpaths and drain-
age works, can be upgraded in the future. City Hall has agreed to waive its
Building Regulations for this project and has agreed that UDA carry out the
supervision and testing normally undertaken by the city. The main variations
with respect to the present Building Regulations are:
(a) Roads: reduced reserve widths, turfed earth
side drains;
(b) Water supply: no reserve tanks in houses:
(c) Sewerage network: plot service pipes run along
the back of the plot -- access for service by
public employees by means of easements written
into the land title. Shallower manhole depths:
(d)  Plot layout:  no back lanes.  Up to 11 contiguous
terrace houses, but houses are separated by masonry
party walls. 10' deep front and rear yards. 7' wide
side yards. Timber house construction permitted
except for party walls.
Site Layout
7.        The layout links the site with surrounding development and
the main road forms a spine along which the industrial and commercial plots
are clustered. Loop roads link the three main residential groups to this
spine, provide direct access to the larger plots, and serve as access points
for emergency vehicles. A network of foot/cycle paths serves most of the
plots, linking them to a bus stop on the main road, and ties the recreation
areas and natural features of the site into the scheme. Vehicular crossings
of foot/cycle paths are minimized. Plots are grouped around a series of
small recreation spaces.
8.        Two residential plot sizes will be offered:  334 plots of size
1,200 sq ft (111.5 m2) and 80 plots of size 2,400 sq ft (223 m2).  There



ANNEX 8
Page 4
are 6 existing squatter households with plots of about 2,400 sq ft each.
There Vill be two industrial plot sizes: 56 plots of size 3,000 sq ft
(280 m ) and 7 plots of size 4,000 sq ft (370 m2).  Ten commercial plots
of 2,100 sq ft (195 m2) each will be provided.  A plot for one community
hall (5,000 sq ft; 465 m2) will be developed next to the commercial sites.
9.        Acreages and land use distribution were summarized in Table
para 1. Of the 36 acres of the first phase (including 1.5 acres for
oxidation pond), the area of saleable land is just above 50% of the
site area and gross density is approximately 14 units per acre. Exist-
ing mining ponds and a large drainage channel running through the site
reduce the percentage of useable land, yet will provide attractive recrea-
tion features and an economic benefit from fish farming.
Site Infrastructure (Cost estimates are in Table 2)
10.       Soil:  The site lies on well consolidated tin mine tailings and
the bearing pressure of the soils is adequate for 2-3 story masonry struc-
tures on strip foundations. Cut and fill is designed to balance within the
site by reducing the slope on the southeast side and filling 2-4 ft on the
northwest side, thereby allowing surface water to drain to the central drain-
age canal. Soil will be compacted in layers to allow immediate construction.
11.       Road and foot/cycle path standards are:
Right-of-Way Carriageway Design Speed
ft)            (ft)       (m.p.h.)
Main access road                          50           25             25
Secondary access road                     40           25             25
Residential service road                  30           16             20
Main foot/cycle path                      20           10              7
Service foot/cycle path                   15            8              5
12.       Side drains run along both sides of all access roads, with turfed
earth sides and precast concrete drain base, except along the main access
road where high run-off volumes and speeds require 9" thick cemented rubble
sides. Road and path base is of varying depth of crusher run, topped with
premix, except in the case of the foot/cycle paths which are topped with
semi-grout. Water pipes, and in some cases, sewage pipes, run beneath the
reserves beside the roads and paths. The 20' wide foot/cycle path and other
paths adjacent to the main drainage channel are accessible to emergency ve-
hicles.



ANNEX 8
Page 5
13.       Drainage:  The site forms the lower part of a large catchment area
of about 200 acres and the stream draining this area runs through the site.
The present stream location will be shifted westward to enable upgrading of
the drainage bed to be done and to drain the lower part of the site. The
new channel profile is designed to take flood run-off from the whole of the
catchment area which is estimated at 3 cu. ft per sec per acre. The stream
runs into a disused mining pool at the upper end of-the site which will be
of recreational and economic value to the residents of the site and its sur-
roundings. A major cost reduction has been achieved by designing the fall
and profile of the main drainage channel for turfed earth construction
instead of using rubble wall. The new channel rejoins the existing stream
at the northern corner of the site. The stream will be widened up to the
bridge over Jalan Sungai Besi to take the large volume of runoff from the
project development. Surface water throughout the site is collected via
side drains to the roads and paths and led to the main drainage channel.
Run-off speed is minimized through tree-planting, grassed open space and
turfed side drains.
14.       Water Supply:  All plots will be served by piped water supply
drawn from the city mains along Jalan Sungai Besi.  Present pressure is
low but still acceptable. It will be improved by mid-1977 as a result of
on-going schemes to expand water supply in Kuala Lumpur. Water consumption
is estimated at 50 gals per person per day, distributed through asbestos
cement class B pipes laid along road and path reserves. Separate links to
the Jalan Sungai Besi mains will be made to serve adjoining squatter areas
included in the upgrading program. Fire hydrants are provided at suitable
locations and no house is farther than 220 ft from a hydrant.
15.       Sewerage:  All plots will be served by a piped sewerage system
leading to a temporary oxidation pond, the main sewer being laid along the
main drainage channel. Average flow is estimated at 50 gals per person per
day and peak flow at three times average flow. The sewer has been designed
to take effluent from the surrounding squatter areas which form part of the
upgrading component. Service manholes are provided at an average of 325 ft
centers. Building regulation waivers have been obtained on the depth of
manholes and easements will be included for plot access so that the sewer-
age reticulation can be laid along the backs of the plots, to reduce sewer
depths and pipe lengths. Pipes are 6", 9" and 12" diameter, salt glazed
stoneware, laid on mass concrete bedding. The oxidation pond, 1.5 acres
in total area (of which actual pond area is 0.8 acre) and located north of
the site, will become redundant by 1980 when the proposed Kuala Lumpur sewerage
network will be extended to Salak South and the project sewage will be led
to the new network and thence to the main treatment plant to the west of
Federal Highway I (to be built under the Kuala Lumpur Sewerage Project,
proposed for Bank financing). The oxidation pond would then be filled in
and the area used for market gardening.
16.       Electricity:  Agreement has been reached that the NEB (National
Electricity Board) will provide electricity, using its own funds. These
costs are not included in the project costs. Electricity is available



ANNEX 8
Page 6
along Jalan Sungai Besi nearby and will be brought into the site. In-
dividual plots will be connected only on demand from the owners. Street
lights, fixed to the electricity poles, will be provided.
17.       Landscaping:  Grassing and paving of recreation areas and clean-
ing and planting around the mining/fish pond will be done by community self-
help. Supply and planting of about 350 trees along roads and footpaths and
in recreational areas are included in the project.
On-Plot Infrastructure and Core Houses
18.       Between all plots there will be a 6" precast boundary drain to
drain surface water to the side drains along public roads and paths. The
larger plots (2,400 sq ft) will have no other on-plot infrastructure pro-
vided as part of the project.
19.       All smaller plots (1,200 sq ft) will have:
(a) a "core house" with 4 walls and roof but excluding
floor, partitions, windows and doors; the side walls
form a 30 ft long and 10 ft high brick party wall
between each plot; the walls are designed to allow
a second story to be built in the future; every second
wall is a "wet" wall with water and sewer connections;
(b) metered water supply to the center of the party wall;
and
(c) a 6" sewer connection to the main sewer, with a squat
toilet with trap set on a concrete base next to the
party wall.
20.       Costs for construction on a typical 1,200 sq ft plot are (M$):
(a) 4 1/2" brickwork with 13 1/2" piers at 10' cts.,
with 3/4" plastering both sides and dpc. (30'
overall length wall); front and back wall                1,880
(b) 6" thick R.C. foundation,
0.7 yd  cub   a M$90.00                                     63

Completion of Core Houses
21.       The core houses on the 1,200 sq ft plots will be completed through
individual and community self-help. Materials loans of M$1,000 (US$400) each
will be made available for all 1,200 sq ft plots. Some purchasers of the
2,400 sq ft plots are also expected to build their houses through self-help
and therefore material loans of M$2,500 (US$1,000) will be provided to about
40% of them.
22.       Without extending the side walls, the small plots can accommodate
single story houses of 600 sq ft. With horizontal side wall extension this
area can be increased to 800 sq ft. By extending the side walls upwards
to form a second story, the house size can expand to 1,600 sq ft.
23.       The following rules for plot development will be incorporated into
each plot sale title, and have also formed the basis of the revised building
regulations of the project. The. rules will be written in Malay, English and
Chinese. Sketches will accompany the regulations.
Rules for Building on Serviced Plots
(a) The owner is permitted to use any building materials
except galvanized iron/roofing. Building materials for
side walls must be of brick or solid concrete block and
follow the rules below. Any timber used in building must
be first treated with rot and termite preservative.
(b) The owner is allowed to build between the side walls on
the 1,200 sq ft plots. Where no side walls are provided,
the owner is permitted to build no farther than 7' from
the plot boundary at the sides, and up to 10' from the
front and rear boundaries. Roofed areas only may extend
a further 1'6" beyond the above dimensions.
(c) The owner is allowed to extend the side walls up to 10'
from the rear boundary of 1,200 sq ft plots. Any hori-
zontal side wall extensions built by the owner must be
constructed of brick and mortar, or solid concrete block
to a thickness of 9" and built centrally along the plot
boundary. 2' 3" wide x 9" thick mesh-reinforced concrete
foundations must be provided, 2' below ground level for
the walls. A 9" wide horizontal bituminous felt damp



ANNEX 8
Page 8
roof course contiguous with the existing damp roof
course must be laid in the new wall.
(d) The owner may also extend the side walls upwards to form
a maximum of two story house. Any vertical extension of
the side walls must be built vertically above, and to the
same thickness as the walls below, and the wall extensions
bounded horizontally into the pier extensions.
(e) Floor and roof beams may be laid into the side walls, but
the ends must be treated with preservative and capped with
1/4" flat asbestos sheet. Adjacent owners must stagger
floor and roof beams laterally to avoid timber to timber
contact.
(f) Side walls must be continued up the underside of the roof
sheeting, and any gaps sealed with mortar.
(g) A maximum of two storys is permitted for any house con-
struction on the site.
(h) Roofs must be constructed which drain rainwater into the
owner's plot. No roof slopes are allowed which drain
water onto adjacent plots.
(i) Any toilet and kitchen construction must have natural
light and ventilation.
(j) Owners have the right to build extensions to party
walls and foundation, as described above, and adjacent
owners are required to tolerate marginal infringements
onto their plot during the construction. The vertical
extension of the side walls by one owner may be used later
by adjacent owners to support their extensions. Where
adjacent owners do not jointly build their walls, the
first owner constructing the walls is entitled to col-
lect a payment from the adjacent owner of M$1.00 per
sq ft superficial area of wall he has built when the
adjacent owner has completed the roof of his extension.
(k) Any extension of the roofed area of the building not
conforming to the conditions described above will be
deemed an infringement of the ownership agreement and
the building regulations, and the illegal portion of
the building will be liable to demolition by City Hall.
(1) Any form of construction contravening the above regula-
tions will be deemed an infringement of the ownership
agreement and the owner will be required to alter the
construction to conform to the regulations within 2



ANNEX 8
Page 9
months of written notice sent by City Hall. In the
event the owner does not comply within 2 months, he
will be subject to a fine of M$100 per month until the
correct alterations are made. If compliance does not
occur within 12 months of the receipt of the notice,
the illegal portion of the construction is liable to
demolition by City Hall.
Settler Characteristics
24.       All Phase 1 households/settlers have been surveyed.  The average
household size is about 5.8, slightly higher than the national average of
5.5 but still indicating mainly nuclear families. Racial composition is
heavily skewed to Malaysians of Chinese origin, who constitute 95% of the
squatters. Average household income is about M$425 per month, about 80%
of the national average and less than half of the average for Kuala Inupur.
The distribution is relatively even (compare Annex 1):
M$/month                       % of all households
-199                                   7
200-399                                  38
400-599                                  31
600-799                                  11
800-999                                   7
1,000-                                      6
25.       About 65% of the present squatters/potential settlers are owner-
occupiers of their dwellings. They pay no property taxes or water rates,
water coming from their own wells. Most pay for electricity, the amounts
ranging from M$5 to M$10 per month. External privies are the normal toilet
arrangements, placed over cesspits or bore-hole latrines. Although squat-
ting free on government land, some pay small amounts to illegal "private
landlords." Thus most of the expenditure on housing goes toward the house
structure.
26.       Housing expenditure as a percentage of income ranges from 4.7% at
the low-income range to 8% at the upper income range. After adding the per-
centage of income spent on electricity charges, the figures range between
8% and 9%, much lower than expenditure on housing among squatters in other
countries. The analysis of the 36 families renting housing indicates that
rented space range from about 180 sq ft to 1,500 sq ft with an average of
550 sq ft. Rental levels range from M$10 to M$130 per month with an aver-
age of about M$20 per month. The average income of renters is below that



ANNEX 8
Page 10
of owner-occupiers. The percentage of the renters' income spent on rent is
still only 7% to 9% of income. The normal percentage of income paid for
rented standard housing in the open market in Kuala Lumpur is about 8% to
12% for low-income households and 15% to 20% for middle income ones.
27.       There are a number of explanations for the relatively low per-
centage of income spent on housing in Peninsular Malaysia and among the
settlers:
(a) Malaysian cities are not large and have a fairly low population
density. The demand for land is not so high as to inflate land
values and thus housing and rental levels;
(b)  the land use structure of Kuala Lumpur is fairly loose with
large open spaces and Government-owned land which can be
squatted on without payment;
(c)  about 65% of the squatter families are owners-occupiers who
have not paid for the land and live in cheap wooden houses
they have constructed themselves, costing M$1,000-2,000.
With such low settlement costs and fairly good incomes,
rents as a percentage of income are low;
(d) low payments for housing is reinforced by tradition. Most
city squatters are first-generation rural migrants from areas
where housing costs are extremely low, and free housing is
often provided if the family works for an agricultural estate;
and
(e) most of the families affected are Chinese who prefer to put
their savings into education for their children and into small
businesses, rather than into houses.
28.       The distribution of willingness to pay for housing and services
shown below is based on responses during the survey and reflects a desire
for security of tenure and for improved infrastructure. The percentages
are consistent with those found among non-squatting home owners in Kuala
Lumpur.

Financing and Cost Recovery
29.       The total economic development cost of M$3.6 million will be
financed and recovered as follows (land has been opportunity costed at
M$0.5 per gross sq ft, about M$1.00 per net sq ft):

30.       Total saleable area is 808,600 sq ft, giving an average sale price
-D44M$3.25 (US$1.30) per sq ft to recover the full cost of Items (a), (b), (c),
(d), (f), and (g) in para. 29.  On-plot development costs for the 1,200 sq ft
plots have been allocated to all plots. The cost of engineering design and
supervision will be borne by the Government for this pilot project. All
residential pl7ts will be sold at cost (M$3.25 per sq ft). The commercial
plots will be sold at (and rented to cover) M$5.00 per sq ft and the industrial
plots at M$7.00 ter sq ft. It is expected that the commercial and industrial
plots can be sold at these prices due to the good location of the plots, close
to Jalan Sungai Besi and the new Seremban Expressway.

31.       A minimum 15% downpayment on plot sales will be required and the
balance will be paid over 20 years at 12%. Average residential plot sale
prices and monthly payments will be as follows:

32.       M$49 is only about 12% of the average monthly household income of
the settlers.  After adding electricity charges (M$6 per south), water and
severage charges (M$5 per month), and property taxes (N$2 per sooth), the
total monthly payment for housing and services becomes K$62 per nonth for
the 1,200 sq ft plots. This is 15% of the average monthly household income
of the settlers. The households with the lowest incomes will be reached by
varying the sale prices according to income, while maintaining the average
of M$3,900 per plot.
B. Businesses - Phase 1 and 2
33.       The total of 21,000 sq ft (0.5 acres) provided for commercial
activities on the main Phase 1 site (para. 8) is more than sufficient to
accommodate shops and stalls to be relocated from the Seremban Expressway
alignment - about 8,000 sq ft will be available for expansion and for
new businesses. Industrial and agricultural businesses to be relocated
have the following land use and employment characteristics:

ANNEX 8
Page 13
34.       The lack of security of tenure, in combination with inadequate
plot sizes and lack of many infrastructure services, is preventing the
47 squatter industries from implementing the expansion plans most of them
have -- an average 60% increase in both jobs and plot sizes. The project
has been designed to meet this demand. The smaller industries will be re-
located to the main Phase 1 site (Map 4) where 3,000 sq ft and 4,000 sq
ft plots will be provided (para. 8).
35.       The larger industries will move to the 16 acre site southwest
of the main site (Phase 2B, para. 2), where they will be provided with
plots sized to suit each individual industry, averaging 1 acre each.
About 2.5 acres (net) will be available for new industries. About 10%
of the 16 acre site will be used for road right-of-way and open space. The
development cost (exclusive of land) is estimated at M$36,670per saleable _
acre (M$0.84 per sq ft). The plots will be sold for about M$174,000 per
acre (M$4.00 per sq ft), nearly three times cost (including land opportunity
cost of M$0.5 per gross sq ft), with a minimum 25% down and the balance at
12% over 10 years.
36.       A total area of about 25 acres will be developed for agricultural
activities, mainly for vegetable and pig farming and for orchid gardens.
About 10 acres will be reserved for the three businesses that are to be
relocated. It is expected that the remaining 15 acres will attract about
15 new businesses. Only access roads will be provided. The sites are on
Government owned land close to new roads and not suitable for other than
agricultural use. A nominal annual rent of M$100 per acre will be charged.
C. Phase 2 - Residential and Upgrading
37.       The Phase 2A sites and services will be developed on 34 acres
just west of Seremban Expressway. Off-site infrastructure costs of M$84,000
will be incurred to connect the site with the main road and water mains
about 0.25 miles away. On-plot costs will be substantially lower than for
Phase 1. No shell houses will be provided, only a wet wall with built in
plumbing. As a result, the sale price required to recover cost is estimated
at only M$2.25 per net sq ft, including the land opportunity cost of M$0.50 per
gross sq ft, The plot sizes will be 1,200, 1,800 and 2,400 sq ft, selling
for M$2,700, M$4,050, and M$5,400, respectively.
38.       The squatter area upgrading component will follow the principles
and design standards used in designing the residential sites and services.
Roads, foot-paths, drainage, sewerage and water supply will be provided.
There will be no major earthworks. Six upgrading areas (Maps 1 and 3) with
about 2,100 households have been selected and surveyed. The cost of roads,
drainage and landscaping will be fully recovered through sale of the plots
to the present squatters. A land cost of M$0.50 per net sq ft will be
included in the sale price.



ANNEX 8

D. Community Facilities
39.       For the Phase 1 settlers, schools and health centers are availa-
ble nearby in the surrounding community. Also, many of these settlers are
moving only a short distance and can retain present links with schools and
other services. A community hall is required, however, and will be provided.
40.       For the Phase 2 settlers, a primary school and a health clinic
is required in addition to a community hall. The site is more isolated than
the Phase 1 site. Also, the settlers are expected to be predominantly Malay,
whereas the schools in the vicinity are Chinese-language. The school will
be used not only by the project settlers but also by Malay children in the
surrounding community who now travel long distances to Malay speaking schools.
E. Land Tenure
41.       All residential plots, including those to be upgraded, will be
sold with 99 year leasehold titles. Commercial and industrial plots will
be sold with 66 year leasehold titles. Agricultural sites will be let with
Temporary Occupation Licenses, renewable annually. The Federal Territory
Land Office will prepare and issue the titles.
F. Settler Selection
42.       All squatters displaced through Bank-financed projects are
automatically eligible to purchase plots. For the remaining plots, the
standard procedure for selecting occupants in public housing will be
followed with the amendment that at least 90% of the 1,200 sq ft plots
will be sold to households with a monthly income of M$300 or less and at
least 90% of the 1,800 sq ft plots (Phase 2 only) to households with a monthly
income of M$400 or less.
G. Revolving Fund
43.       The spread in interest rates between the 8.5% charged on the
Government loan to City Hall and the 12% charged to the settlers, will
cover the cost of administration and defaults and generate a small sur-
plus. Additional surpluses will accrue to City Hall as a result of the
sale of plots above cost and the opportunity cost pricing of land. These sur-
pluses will go into a revolving fund to be used to finance future sites and
services projects. The project would generate a fund of about M$6.0 million
by 1980, assuming an annual financial rate of return of 7% on the fund (see
Table 4).  The fund may be built up more rapidly through sale of project
mortgages.



ANNEX 8

H. Administration
44.       UDA is the executing agency, on behalf of City Hall.  To assist
the settlers in building a new community and in self help housing construc-
tion, City Hall will provide on the site a community development officer and
an engineer with assistants. Administration and maintenance following
construction will be handled by City Hall and federal ministries in accordance
with standard procedures. Collection of payments will be done by the Land
Office.
I. Sites and Services Unit
45.       A new Sites and Services Unit in UDA has been established.  Cost
of professional personnel, training and equipment through 1978 (M$1 million)
is included in the project costs. About 35% of the cost would be personnel
costs for monitoring and evaluation, about 20% would be for training and
equipment, and the balance would be for planning and engineering design of
this and future projects. Staffing and costs through 1978 (3 years) are
as follows (1975 prices):

SECOND KUALA LUMPUR URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT
Project Objectives and Monitoring
A. Transport
Conceptual Basis
1.        A simple and useful although only partial measure of the cost-
effectiveness of a transport system is the average number of passengers carried
per passenger car unit (pcu) equivalent. Different types of vehicles use
different amounts of road network capacity and their capacity utilization
is made comparable by expressing them in pcu equivalents. For instance, a
motorcycle in urban traffic conditions is equivalent to about 0.4 pcu in term
of capacity utilization and a stage bus is equivalent to about 2.0 pcu. By
dividing the number of persons carried by a vehicle by its pcu value, a
measure is obtained of how many pcu equivalents of road network capacity are
used per person traveling with this vehicle. The persons-per-pcu value varies
from 1-2 for a private car to 15-20 for a stage bus.
2.        Average occupancy by type of vehicle, vehicle pcu values, and the
composition of the vehicle fleet determine the system-wide average number
of persons carried per pcu equivalent.  This average is a partial measure of how
efficiently the road netwurk capacity is being used. The higher this ratio
is, the more efficiently is the existing capacity utilized. And, the higher
the ratio is, the less additional capacity is required to meet an increase in
travel demand.
3.        The global objective of the proposed project is to improve the cost-
effectiveness of the Kuala Lumpur transport system by increasing the average
number of persons carried per pcu per unit time. This global objective is
more operationally expressed in terms of achieving (a) a modal shift from
private to public transport, (b) increased occupancy of private cars and
taxis and (c) increased traffic speeds, particularly for high occupancy
vehicles.
Project Objectives/Performance Indicators
4.        The following quantitative project objectives have been established:
A. Global: Increase the average number of persons carried per pcu equiva-
lent through: (i) an absolute modal shift during peak periods of 10 from
non-bus to bus travel by 1980 and a further 5% by 1985 (the estimated present



ANNEX 9
Page 2
62%/38% non-bus/bus modal split would become 52%/48% by 1980 and 47%/53X by
1985: see Table 1); and (ii) an increase in average private car and taxi
occupancy during peak periods of 10% by 1980 and a further 5% by 1985 (e.g,
the estimated present occupancy of 1.9 persons per private car would become
2.1 by 1980 and 2.2 by 1985: see Table 1). The system-wide average number
of persons per pcu would increase from 3.0 at present to 3.6 in 1980 and
3.9 in 1985 if these objectives are achieved. The objectives apply to
traffic passing through a cordon around the central area during the peak
periods 6:30-10 a.m. and 3:30-7 p.m. on a typical weekday. The cordon roughly
corresponds to the Inner Ring Road east of the Klang and Gombak rivers and
the Middle Ring Road west of the rivers.
B.   Service Levels:  Improve public transport service levels by:  (i) in-
creasing average bus passenger trip speed by 20% by 1980 and by a further 10%
by 1985 (the estimated present trip speed of 6.6 mph would be 7.9 mph by
1980 and 8.7 mph by 1985); the objective is for bus passenger trips going
through the central area cordon between 6:00 a.m. and 9 p.m.; the trip
speed includes walking to and from the bus stops, waiting at the stop, and
any transfers; and (ii) reducing waiting time at bus stops by ensuring that
by 1980 less than 10% and by 1985 less than 7% of all buses fail to clear
queues of waiting passengers. The objective is for buses going through the
central area cordon during the two peak periods on a typical weekday.
5.        Objectives B(i) and B(ii) are not only means aimed at helping to
achieve the modal shift of Objective A(i) and to increase cost-effectiveness,
but also ends in themselves. A large portion of the traveling public simply
do not have a modal choice -- they can only afford to travel by bus. Objectives
B(i) and B(ii) will assure them improved service. At present, the average
trip speed by public transport throughout a typical weekday is about 40% of
the average trip speed by private transport. The ratio is typically 60% or
higher in major cities in developing countries.
6.        As regards the global Objective A, Table 1 shows the estimated
1975 modal split, vehicle occupancies and average number of persons per pcu,
and the targets for 1980 and 1985 (peak periods, typical weekday). The
estimated project targets for 1980 and 1985 are marked with asterisks. As
indicated by the persons-per-pcu figures, the cost-effectiveness of the
transport system would be increased by about 20% by 1980 and by a further
8% by 1985.
Monitoring
7.        The five key performance indicators discussed above -- non-bus/
bus travel modal split, private car occupancy, taxi occupancy, bus trip
speed, and bus failures to clear queues -- are listed in Annex 10 together
with the objective for each of them and the estimated 1980 and 1985 targets.
Monitoring of the achievement of the objectives will be carried out jointly
by the TMD in City Hall and the HP & PTU in the MWT. Traffic counts and



ANNEX 9
Page 3
sample study and interviews of bus passengers will be carried out on two
consecutive and typical weekdays each quarter.
B. Sites and Services
Project Objectives/Performance Indicators
8.        Among the objectives of the sites and services component are (a) to
provide low cost plots and houses for low income households; (b) to generate
employment; and (c) to raise the income levels (and living standards) of the
settlers in both absolute and, particularly, relative terms. The following
performance indicators and targets have been defined to monitor the achieve-
ment of these objectives:
C. Low Cost: The average total cost of land, infrastructure, and completed
houses should be (i) M$5,500 or less (1975 prices) for the 1200 square foot
plots in Phase 1; (ii) M$4,000 or less (1975 prices) for 1200 square foot
plots in Phase 2; and (iii) M$5,500 (1975 prices) or less for 1800 square
foot plots in Phase 2. The principles for opportunity costing and cost allo-
cation outlined in Annex 8 will be followed. A house will be regarded as
completed one year after the plot has been occupied. To the project develop-
ment cost will be added the out-of-pocket cost to the settler of materials
and labor for house completion.
D.  Low Income:  Monthly household income of purchasers of low income plots
(excluding displaced squatters) should be M$300 or less for 90% of households
purchasing 1200 square foot plots and M$400 or less for 90% of households
purchasing 1800 square foot plots. The income levels are expreseed in 1975
prices.
E.   Em.loyment Generation:  The number of employees of businesses who have
purchased and occupied plots should through 1980 on the average increase
more rapidly than experienced on the previous sites over the past four years.
F.   Income Levels:  The income distribution within the community should not
deteriorate, and the average income should increase relative to the Federal
Territory average.
Monitoring
9.        The performance indicators are listed in Annex 10 together with
the objectives/targets. Monitoring of the achievement of the targets will
be carried out jointly by the Housing Unit in City Hall, the Sites and Services
Unit in UDA, and the Land Office.

Project Supervision
1.        Annex 14 lists the key actions on which supervision will initially
focus. It is also expected that a substantial amount of supervision is re-
quired to assist in developing the monitoring aspects of the project, both
conceptually and methodologically, and this work should be coordinated with
Bank-wide efforts at research and development of monitoring in the urban
transport and sites and services sectors.

Economic Evaluation
A. Transport
1,        The economic evaluation of the transport components of the
project is based on a calculation of incremental costs and benefits
associated with the provision of the various components. Economic rates
of return (ERRs) were calculated for the following cases:
Case I      : The complete transport project ("Policy and Traffic
Engineering" package; all new roads and road improvements)
compared to the "do nothing" or "without" situation
(continuation of present transport policies; existing
road network with committed improvements).
Case II    : The "Policy and Traffic Engineering" package (policy
measures; traffic engineering and control improvements;
minor intersection improvements; HOV facilities),
compared to the "do nothing" or "without" situation.
Case III-VI: Each of the three major road components and the Pudu
busway, taken separately, by comparing, for each case,
the costs and benefits of the project with, and without,
the component in question.
2.        The cases tested and the rates of return are shown in the following
table. Basic travel data for 1973, and rough estimates for 19'9, are shown
in Table 1; vehicle operating costs in Table 2; benefit and cost streams in
Table 3; underlying assumptions in paras. 3-9; and sensitivity analysis in
para. 10.

Costs
3.        The project costs shown in para. 3.14 were used with the 12%
physical contingency. The value of Goveriment-owned land was added to
project costs, with the estimates of land value based on prices for nearby
private land acquired for the project.
Benefits
4.        Traffic Projections.  The average annual growth of the vehicle
population in the period 1973-75 exceeded 12%, but is now slowing down. For
the evaluation, vehicle population growth in the period 1975-2000 is conser-
vatively assumed to be 5% a year. A higher growth rate would increase the
benefits from the project.
5.        The origins and destinations of person trips were estimated on
the basis of detailed land use projections for the metropolitan area divided
into 187 analysis zones. In order to reduce the complexity of the computa-
tions, the benefits and losses to LOV users due to area road pricing were
excluded. Although, on balance, the reduction in congestion may be expected
to result in net benefits to LOV users as a group, there is as yet insufficient
Information for an assessment of gains and losses to be made. The monitoring
of the project is expected to throw light on this question.
6.        Vehicle Operating Costs:  Estimates of vehicle operating costs
used in the analysis are shown in Table 2, by type of vehicle and by speed.
Indirect taxes are excluded.
7.        Person Travel Time Costs:  Time spent on travel in working time
(estimated to be 20% of all non-home based trips, or 5% of all person trips)
was valued at 1.10 times actual hourly wage rates. All other travel time
was valued at one third of the average wage rate. Wage rates were assumed
to increase by 3% per year.

Grade-separated Interchanges
8.        The proposed interchanges on Jalans Lornie, Damansara, Parlimen
and Kuching, and the Jalan Ipoh overpass, were each assessed individually.
The evaluation used as a base case an assumed at-grade signalized intersection,
with sufficient lanes to accommodate the expected peak-hour traffic under
near-capacity conditions. The cost of delay was taken at M$1.77 per pcu-hour;
M$1.56 as the occupants' time costs and M$0.21 as vehicle idling costs. The
calculations are summarized in Table 4.
Economic Life
9.        It was assumed that the economic life of the project is 25 years,
including the construction period. That is, cost and benefit streams
through the year 2000 were considered for all components. It was assumed
that the project facilities will have no remaining value in year 2000 and
land values in that year were disregarded.
Sensitivity Analysis
10.       The sensitivity of the economic rate of return for all the trans-
port components together (Case I) was estimated for variations in key
assumptions:
A.   With above assumptions (paras. 3-9)        :    31%
B.   With all person-time values halved         :    222
C.   Benefits do not increase after 1980        :    27%
D.   Benefits cut off 10 years after
completion of each component                   28%
E.  With 20% cost over-run                      :    27%
These assumptions were also calculated for each of the other cases
(II-VI) and the results are summarized in Table 5.
B. Sites and Services
11.       In calculating the ERR for Phase 1 and 2 of the sites and services
coxhponents, the cost streams were estimated mainly on the basis of project
costs with a 12% physical contingency, plus the opportunity cost of the
land. Benefit streams were estimated as follows:
(a) residential sites: imputed rental value of completed
houses;
(b) industrial and commercial sites: plot sale prices,
which reflect market values; and



ANNEX 16
Page 4
(c) squatter area upgrading: estimated increase in
market land values.
12.       No attempt was made to estimate the ERR for the agricultural sites
and services. It is, however, substantial--the land opportunity cost and the
development cost are minimal whereas the benefits are large (Annex 8). Water
supply and sewerage costs and benefits reflected in the water and sewerage
charges were also excluded from the economic analysis, following normal
practice. Community facilities were also excluded.
13.       The ERR for the component as a whole is 23%.  It is 13% for the
residential sites, 26% for squatter area upgrading, and substantially higher
for commercial and industrial sites. The latter rates are uncertain due to
the difficulties in estimating the opportunity cost of land alienated or
zoned for industrial and commercial activities--this cost has been assumed
to equal the opportunity cost of residential land. A 20% increase in all
cost elements reduces the ERR for the whole component to 19%. Key assump-
tions and calculations are described below. Project costs and sales prices
for industrial and commercial plots are described in detail in Annex 8.
Costs
14.       Project costs with a 12% physical contingency were used for all
components. The opportunity cost of land was also included at M$0.50 per
gross sq ft for all components.
15.       House Completion Costs:  For the 1,200 sq ft plots it was esti-
mated that the following additional costs will be incurred to complete the
first stage 600 sq ft house, in addition to the project costs for on-plot
development (core house) and materials (M$1,000):
(a) M$250 worth of professional assistance; and
(b) M$400 worth of self-help (100 man-days at 50%
of the unskilled wage rate of M$8 per day; see
Table 6 for wage rates).
The houses will be completed within 18 months of plot purchase.
16.       For the 2,400 sq ft plots it was estimated that the houses would
be an average size of 1,000 sq ft and cost an average of M$10,000 to build
(typical cost for private contractor-built houses was M$10.00 per sq ft in
mid-1975). They would be completed within two years of plot purchase.
17.       Relocation and Disturbance Costs in Squatter Upgrading Areas:  The
construction of roads and footpaths where none, or only very narrow ones,
existed before will necessitate some relocation of squatter houses. Since
- there is little previous experience of upgrading in Malaysia, cost estimates
were based on data from the Jakarta Kampong Improvement Program (KIP) where



ANNEX 16
Page 5
relocation costs are 13% of the program's infrastructure cost. However,
average plot coverage is 75% in Jakarta compared to, 55% in this project and
relocation costs were therefore reduced to 0.13 x 0.55/0.75 = 10% of infra-
structure cost, or a total of M$0.3 million. Disturbance costs incurred by
all squatters are also included, adding another 5% to the cost stream.
Benefits
18.       Residential:  The imputed rental value for the self-help constructed
houses (1,200 sq ft plot) is taken as the average of the market rent for a
contractor built house and the market rent for a squatter type house, both
in the vicinity of the project. This approach takes into account that the
project houses have attributes of both conventional housing (security of
tenure, adequate infrastructure, well built core, etc.) and squatter housing
(lower standards, non-professional finish, etc.). The two rents are M$0.18
and M$0.04 per sq ft per month, respectively, with an average of M$0.11.
M$0.18 per sq ft per month was used to estimate the benefits from the 2,400
sq ft plots.
19.       Squatter Area Upgradin&:  The Jakarta experience was called upon
again. There, the average increase in land values attributable to KIP has
been 96% (initially 76% but increased to 96% through imoroved project design).
This percentage increase was assumed in estimating the benefits of the up-
grading component.
C. Shadow Pricing
20.       All contract labor, materials and equipment have been valued at
market prices in the economic evaluation. There is full employment for con-
struction workers in Kuala Lumpur. Self-help labor in the sites and serv-
ices component has been valued at 50% of the market wage rate for unskilled
workers, excluding overhead (para. 15 and Table 6). Land has been shadow
priced (opportunity costed) for both the transport and sites and services
components as discussed above.
