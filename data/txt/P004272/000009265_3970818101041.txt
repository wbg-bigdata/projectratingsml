FELDA PALK OIL MILLS PROJECT
Loan and Project Sumnary
Borrower:          Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA)
Guarantor:         Malaysia
Beneficiary:       FELDA and FELDA Mills Corporation (FELMILL), a FELDA
subsidiary.
Loan Amount:       US$31.2 million equivalent.
Terms:             Repayable in 15 years including 3 years grace at the
standard variable interest rate.
Onlending
Terms:           FELDA would onlend to FELMILL about US$30.9 million of the
loan amount for 15 years, including three years of grace
during which interest would be capitalized, at the standard
variable interest rate. FELMILL would bear the foreign
exchange risk on its part of the Bank loan.
Prolect
Description:     The project would support FELDA's palm oil mill construc-
tion program wh4ch, imder the responsibility of FELMILL,
provides fruit proeessing services to FELDA's smallholder
land settlement schemes. It would strengthen FELMILL's
mill planning and operation and would assist in construc-
ting seven palm oil mills with a total capacity of 351 ton
- fresh fruit bunch of oil palm (FFB)/hour. The project
would also support FELDA's ongoing efforts to strengthen
its n.orporate and financial planning and accounting
systems, by providing consulting services to design a
computarized data base system for FELDA. The main risk
associated with the project would be reduced milling utili-
zation due to lower than expected crop production. This
could result from lower planting rates, crop damage, and
reduced yields due to weather or other factors. The risk
of underutilization would be reduced by reviewing prior to
the start of construction of each mill, its justification
and timing in light of updated crop projections.

FELDA PALM OIL MILLS PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. BACKGROUND
A. The Agricultural Sector
1.01      The agricultural sector plays a dominant role in the Malaysian
economy, though its relative importance is declining as the country proceeds
toward industrialization. The sector accounts for about 23% of GDP, 40% of
merchandise exports and 35% of employment. In the 1960s and early 1-970s agri-
culture grew at 7% p.a., but since 1976, growth slowed to an average 5.5% p.a.
during 1976-80 and to 3.7% p.a. during 1981-83. Agricultural production has
been primarily export-oriented. Malaysia is the world's largest producer and
exporter of rubber and palm oil, supplying about 40% of the world's natural
rubber output and more than half of palm oil production. Its contribution to
world exports is about 45% for natural rubber and 70% for palm oil. Malaysia
is also a major exporter of natural wood and timber.
1.02      Malaysia's climate and soil conditions provide a strong comparative
advantage for tree crops development, particularly rubber and oil palm.  About
one third of Peninsular Malaysia and less than 5% of East Malaysia (Sabah and
Sarawak) are under cultivation, while most of the remaining area is still
tropical forest. The total cultivated area is about 4.5 million ha, of which
about 2.0 million ha are under rubber, 1.3 million ha oil palm, 300,000 ha
coconut, 200,000 ha cocoa and 500,000 ha rice; about half of the rice area is
double cropped. Other crops include sugarcane, pineapple, tobacco and
pepper. The entire rice area and about two thirds of the tree crop area are
in smallholdings averaging 1.2 ha; the remainder is mainly in commercial
estates.
1.03      With the, until recently, strong performance of the Malaysian
economy, poverty incidence has been greatly reduced from about 49% in 1970, to
29% in 1980. However, poverty remains high in the rural areas which account
for about two thirds of the nation's poor.  This is particularly the case
among rice, rubber and coconut smallholders and fishermen, primarily because
of small farm sizes and low productivity. With increasing industrialization
and low incomes in the sector, the rural youth are migrating to urban areas,
reducing the agricultural labor force and further contributing to the slowdown
of agricultural output.
Government Policies and Strategy
1.04      Government efforts in agriculture have traditionally been oriented
to poverty alleviation in the rural areas, particularly among rice and rubber
smallholders. In view of the slowdown in agriculture and increasing migration
to urban areas, the Government, with Bank assistance, recently reviewed its



- 2 -
sectoral objectives and announced its National Agricultural Policy (NAP).
Maintaining the emphasis on poverty alleviation, the NAP objectives are:
(a) maximization of farm incomes to improve the quality of rural life and
facilitate retention of productive labor in the sector; and (b) expansion of
production of traditional and new export and food crops to revitalize the
agricultural sector and to achieve food security.
1.05      The Government's main objectives have been pursued through two basic
strategies: (a) land development and settlement to provide viable farm sizes
and adequate incomes, and to expand tree crop production for export through
well organized and managed settlement schemes; and (b) in situ development
projects designed to consolidate small farms, rehabilitate idle lands,
increase productivity and improve farm management. This has led to develop-
ment of large land settlement schemes by the state governments and the Federal
Land Development Authority (FELDA); irrigation projects by the Ministry of
Agriculture; land rehabilitation programs by the Federal Land Consolidation
and Rehabilitation Authority (FELCRA); and rubber replanting and mini-estate
development programs by the Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority
(RISDA). Under the NAP, these strategies will continue. But greater atten-
tion will be given to the problems of uneconomic farm units, unremunerative
crops and low productivity in the in situ development projects. This includes
mechanization and promotion of group farmirig with centralized management and
the intensification of integrated support services and credit for selected
crops.
Bank Sector Strategy
1.06      The Bank has consistently supported the Government's poverty alle-
viation objectives and institution building efforts in agriculture. Ini-
tially, Bank lending in agriculture concentrated on land development and
settlement, and irrigation. More recently, emphasis has also been given to
programs designed to raise productivity in existing smallholder areas, such as
irrigation and drainage improvement, rehabilitation of tree crops, land
consolidation, agricultural research and extension. To date, the Bank has
made 23 agricultural loans amounting to US$731.3 million, nearly 45% of total
lending to Malaysia.
1.07      In view of the sector's contribution to national output and poverty
alleviation, an important thrust of future Bank assistance to Malaysia will
continue to be for agriculture along the lines proposed in the NAP. Particu-
lar attention will be given to the solution of structural problems facing the
sector, particularly through land consolidation and improved efficiepcy and
management of smallholder agriculture; and to strengthening the land develop-
ment and settlement programs, as the most effective way of providing viable
farm units and improving rural incomes.
B. Land Development and Settlement
1.08      Malaysia has a long and successful history of government sponsored
and organized land development and settlement of poor rural families. The
factors behind this success include the availability of large tracts of
agriculturally suitable forest land; the introduction of commercially



valuable cash crops (rubber and oil palm); well designed and profitable large-
scale agricultural development programs, and management models adapted from
the Malaysian private estate sector; and substantial, well planned and managed
mobilization of government resources. Although land development and settle-
ment schemes have been implemented by several federal and state agencies, the
pacesetter and predominant agency has been FELDA.
FELDA's Development Strategy
1.09      FELDA's land development and settlement strategy consists of an
integrated package comprising: land clearing, planting and initial mainte-
nance; development of settler villages, including housing, roads, water supply
and basic infrastructure services; selection and emplacement of settlers;
provision of agricultural services such as credit, technical assistance,
inputs, processing and marketing; and community organization and social
amenities. Agricultural development is based on tree crops, particularly oil
palm, rubber and cocoa. Sugarcane and coffee are also grown on a limited
scale. To ensure efficient farming and land use, settlers are not allocated
individual farm lots. When entering the scheme they are provided with a house
on a 0.1 ha block, and an unidentified 4.0 ha (10 ac) landholding within a
96 ha block of land *hared by 24 settlers. The block is jointly farmed by the
group; individual settlers are paid wages and share profits. By processing
and marketing the produce, FELDA ensures loan repayments after settlers
receive a reasonable income.
II. THE BORROWER AND EXECUTING AGENCY (FELDA AND FELMILL)
A. Organizacion and Administration
FELDA
2.01      FELDA was established in 1956 as a Federal Statutory Body.  It
operates within the Ministry of Land and Regional Development, under policy
guidance and general supervision of a Board consisting of 13 members including
Government and private sector representatives. Day-to-day administration is
under the Director General assisted by two Deputy Director Generals for
Operations and Services, and 15 specialized department heads. At field level
FELDA is organized by geographical area and development schemes. The current
organization structure is shown in Annex 1.1.
2.02      FELDA management and staff are experienced and dedicated.  Most
senior managers began in junior positions, many of them in the settlement
schemes. FELDA staff numbered some 8,000 in mid-1984, about 76% in settlement
schemes, 13% in operating departments, 9% in the head office and 2% in train-
ing facilities and schools.
2.03      Since 1972 FELDA has established eight subsidiary corporations and
entered into six joint ventures with the private sector in order to provide
specific development services and down-stream activities to the settlement
program (see Annex 1.2). Each of these undertakings is headed by a General
Manager and operated on a commercial basis, largely independent from FELDA,
with its own staff and resources. A Managing Director is responsible for



-4-
overall operation of the subsidiary corporations and a Group Executive
Director (Commercial) oversees the joint ventures; both Directors report to
the Chairman of FELDA.
FELDA Mills Corporation (FELMILL)
2.04      The largest of FELDA subsidiaries is the FELDA Mills Corporation
(FELMILL). As a necessary part of its land development and settlement package
(para. 1.09), and in accordance with standard practice in large private
estates, FELDA, since inception, has provided settlements with oil palm and
rubber processing facilities to ensure timely processing and avoid losses,
particularly during peak harvest months. Initially, palm oil and rubber
factory construction and operation were under FELDA's direct control. In 1975
FELMILL was established and assumed factory ownership and operation respon-
sibility, but FELDA retained responsibility for planning and construction.
FELDA owns about 93% of FELMILL's equity; the remaining 7% belongs to the
settlers and FELDA staff. FELMILL owns one of the companies originally estab-
lished by FELDA and has controlling interest over two others (see Annex 1.2).
The Board of FELMILL comprises the Chairman and the Director General of FELDA,
FELMILL's Managing Director, the Deputy Secretary General of the Ministry of
Lands, the Assistant Director of Budget from the Federal Treasury and four
settler representatives. Day-to-day operations are the responsibility of a
Managing Director, a Deputy Managing Director and six line managers. Mill
operations are organized into six regional zones (see FELMILL organization
chart i.n Annex 1.3). FELMILL staff, which has been largely recruited from
FELDA, is qualified and experienced, and totals 1,680. About 14% are at head-
quarters in Kuala Lumpur and 86% at the mills and zone offices; labor at the
mills totals 4,350.
B. Planning, Budgeting and Information Systems
2.05      FELDA's Department of Planning and Budgeting prepares annual plans
and budgets related to scheme operations, mill construction, and administra-
tive expenditures. The present budget system requires strengthening. First,
budgets are expenditure related and do niot account for revenues derived from
FELDA operations; budgets are prepared for annual targets, and year-to-date
comparisons with actual expenditures are virtually meaningless until the final
three months of the year, making monitoring of expenditures ineffective.
Secondly, budgeting does not cover all FELDA operations, since it excludes 12
of the FELDA accounts involving smallholder activities, i.e. replanting
reserve and general reserve accounts. Lastly, planning is also undertaken in
the Finance Department, which projects financial requirements and monitors the
subsidiaries. This has reduced FELDA management effectiveness in routine
corporate and financial planning.
2.06      FELDA's present management information systems also require
strengthening. Appropriate management information is complex at FELDA, since
its operations include those of a financial institution, equity investor, con-
tractor, development planner, and provider of a range of services for small-
holders. While FELDA prepares monthly, quarterly and annual management



reports, their number and complexity require simplification. At present some
46 separate operational and financial statements are required from each
settlement scheme. The present reporting system inundates managers with
separate reports on smallholders' income, loan and arrears accounts, crop
yields, etc. and a number of accounting and financial statements from branch,
zone offices and head office.
2.07      To address these problems, shortly before project appraisal in
mid-1984, FELDA engaged consultants to review and propose improvements to its
budgeting, accounting, and management information systems, and to assist FELDA
staff in their implementation. The consultants are expected to submit their
findings and recommendations by mid-1985, and after FELDA's review and
approval, would prepare detailed proposals and implementation procedures by
end-1985. Under the proposed project, the Bank would review the consultant's
recomnendations and FELDA's action plan for implementation (para. 4.05).
Implementation of these improvements would require changes in FELDA's elec-
tronic data processing (EDP), which would be addressed under the project
(para. 3.11).
2.08      FELMILL planning and budgeting is sound.  FELMILL, in concert with
FELDA's Processing Department, routinely provides FELDA with budget require-
ments for mill construction. FELMILL's operational budgets and corporate
plans, prepared on both a short and long term basis, are satisfactory.
FELMILL's information systems are also effective for managers and decision
making. Monthly reporting of operations and cost accounts by mill are excel-
lent as are operational briefs for senior managers. FELMILL prepares routine
monthly and quarterly profit and loss statements, manpower reports, and
production and factory throughput statements, all of which are routinely and
easily evaluated for sound decision making. It is anticipated that FELMILL
will further computerize management information but this is being well managed
by FELMILL's own staff.
C. FELDA's Performance
Land Development and Settlement
2.09      As shown in the table below, at March 31, 1984, FELDA had settled,
mainly in Peninsular Malaysia, near 83,700 families in 367 settlement schemes
comprising about 613,000 ha, 66% in oil palm. The total area currently in
production is some 35,,000 ha, over 250,000 ha of which is oil palm.

2.10      FELDA settlers are recruited from smallholder and landless rural
families living below the relative poverty income level, currently set in
Malaysia at US$1,816 equivalent p.a. per family. Under FELDA's settlement
program, annual family incomes reached between US$3,600 and US$4,700 in oil
palm schemes and US$2,100 in rubber schemes. Average investment per family in
1984 prices is about US$22,300, including site clearing and crop establish-
ment, village infrastructure, housing and management. Although this is high
compared to settlement schemes in other countries, it is reasonable consider-
ing higher costs and socio-economic conditions in Malaysia.  Furthermore
except for management expenditures, all agriculture investments and housing
amounting to about 60% of the overall settlement cost are fully paid by
settlers through long term loans.
2.11      The Government's land development target under the 1981-85 Fourth
Malaysia Plan (FMP) is 530,000 ha, about one fourth of which will be carried
out by FELDA. During 1981-83, the first three years of the FMP, FELDA devel-
oped some 104,000 ha of new land at an average annual rate of 34,700 ha, 16%
above the original FMP target. At the FMP mid-term review the target was
increased and FELDA will develop an additional 57,000 ha in 1984-85. Until
1978, FELDA was limited to Peninsular Malaysia. However, due to increasing
difficulties in obtaining suitable land in peninsular Malaysia, in 1979, it
began operations in Sabah, where the State Government allocated 100,000 ha for
FELDA development, and another 100,000 ha is under consideration. Land devel-
opment in Sabah involves more complex socioeconomic and physical conditions
than West Malaysia, and progress is expected to be slower.
FELMILL Oil Palm and Rubber Processing Facilities
2.12      Given the predominance of palm oil production in FELDA settlement
schemes, palm oil milling is FELMILL's principal activity. By mid-1985,
FELMILL will have in operation 56 palm oil mills with a total capacity of
about 2,750 tons Fresh Fruit Bunch (FFB)/hour, making FELMILL the largest palm
oil producer in Malaysia. During the last four years, construction of palm
oil mills was accelerated to service new production areas and to cater for



- 7 -
expected production yield increases due to weevil assisted pollination. Eight
mills were commissioned in 1984 and one more will be commissioned in 1985.
Mill operation is generally satisfactory, but some mills are affected by low
oil extraction and recovery rates due to unripe fruit and processing losses.
These problems are being addressed by FELDA and FELMILL and would be pursued
further under the proposed project. In addition to milling, FELMILL is also
involved in other palm oil down stream activities. It operates two export
bulking facilities and a palm oil refinery, and owns jointly with private
investors two palm oil refining and manufacturing companies (Annex 1.2, part
*B, paras. 4-6).
2.13      By the end of 1984 FELMILL had ten rubber factories with a total
545 ton/day capacity, which process about 75% of the rubber produced in FELDA
settlement schemes. For marketing purposes, the various factories utilize
different manufacturing processes and produce latex concentrate and different
grades of Standard Malaysia Rubber (SMR). Initially, rubber operations were
affected by Government changes in the SMR grading system, which conflictec
with the original factory designs; thus some factories operated at a loss.
However, with an improved marketing strategy, new factory designs and better
operating practices, FELMILL rubber factory operations are now satisfactory
and profitable.
D. Bank Lending for FELDA
2.14      Since 1968 FELDA has completed implementation of five Bank financed
projects in the states of Pahang (Loans 533, 672, 885 and 1044-MA) and Johore
(Loan 967-MA); and is nearing completion of a sixth project (Loan 1590-MA) in
these states and Negeri Sembilan. These projects cover some 66 settlement
schemes, comprising development of 120,750 ha, settlement of 29,450 families
and establishment of 15 palm oil mills with a total capacity of 751 FFB
ton/hour (see Annex 2). This has made a substantial contribution to the
Malaysian settlement program and represencs about 20% of FELDA's land develop-
ment. Through its involvement in these projects the Bank has maintained a
policy dialogue with FELDA, thereby helping to improve FELDA's settlement
program and institutional strength. This has included: development of long-
term integrated planning and implementation strategies, particularly through
the three Jengka triangle projects (Loans 533, 672 and 885-MA); improvements
in accounting, management and procurement procedures; strengthening of staff
and operations of palm oil mills; containment of settlement costs per family
by reducing farm sizes; introduction of improved planting materials and wild
life preservation and control measures.
2.15      Four Project Performance Audit Reports (PPAR)Y- and a recently
issued Project Completion Report (PCR) on the first five projects state that
they have all been successful in meeting project objectives. Achievements in
land development, crop yields, settler emplacement and incomes, and economic
returns have been well within targets and have sometimes surpassed them.
1/  PPAR Nos. 2122, 3024, 3978 and 4221.



-8-
Implementation, however, was sometimes delayed due to deficient planting tech-
niques, crop damage by wild animals, and slow construction of roads and other
social infrastructure by other government agencies, particularly the Public
Works Department (PWD).
2.16      Future Bank assistance to FELDA will focus on the changing circum-
stances facing the tree crop sector in Malaysia in general, and FELDA settle-
ments in particular, which will require operational and institutional adjust-
ments. As land becomes scarce in Peninsular Malaysia, future FELDA efforts
will be concentrated on consolidation of ongoing schemes in West Malaysia and
increasing development in Sabah and Sarawak. Consolidation of ongoing schemes
requires completion of basic infrastructure and processing facilities to
accelerate emplacement of settlers and production benefits. Furthermore, as
plantings in the early settlement schemes reach the end of their useful life,
replanting will become increasingly important and during the period following
replanting, reduced settler incomes from palm oil and rubber will make
farming, at least temporarily, less attractive. Similarly, as the original
settlers grow older and the younger generation migrates to urban areas, labor
shortage may become a problem. This would require development of new off-farm
activities to ennance income and keep young settlers on the schemes. Another
issue facing FELDA is the loss of direct control over agricultural production
and marketing, with the risk of reduced productivity, when land titles are
issued to settlers completing repayment of their development loans. Also to
be addressed, in this context, is the Government's stated intention to make
the settlers shareholders, instead of granting them individual land titles.
Land development and settlement in east Malaysia will require a different
approach due to low population densities, the geopolitical status of the two
east Malaysian states and the large influx of foreign labor from neighboring
countries.
2.17      Its excellent record notwithstanding, FELDA faces managerial
problems due to past rapid growth and the changing nature of its activities.
FELDA's accounting and management information systems are being upgraded, and
some changes may be required in the organizational structure to allow more
decentralization and increased participation of middle level management in
decision making. In the past FELDA has been totally dependent on government
grants and concessionary loans for its development and commercial activities
and operation. With the fiscal constraints facing Malaysia, and the Govern-
ment's stated policy of privatization and financial self-sufficiency of
revenue earning entities, FELDA should progressively rely less on government
funding, and should consider using private capital and its own funds to
finance its commercial operations. The future Bank dialogue with FELDA would
address these issues, but, in view of its relatively advanced institutional
development, Bank assistance to FELDA is expected to be phased out over the
medium term.

III. THE PROJECT
A. Project Origin and Preparation
3.01      In the past, Bank assistance to FELDA's land settlement program has
been on a scheme-by-scheme basis. Bank loans were made to the Government
which onlent the funds to FELDA on concessionary terms. During Government-
FELDA-Bank discussions in late 1982 and early 1983, it was agreed that the
Bank could more effectively provide assistance for individual components of
the overall settlement program, such as construction of palm oil mills, access
roads and water supply facilities for the settlement schemes, on a time-slice
basis. This would permit continuance of the policy dialogue and a focus on
specific component-related and other broader issues. Bank processing of the
proposed palm oil mills project was delayed due to fiscal constraints facing
Malaysia. However, in January 1984, the Government reinstated its request for
Bank assistance in support of its economic recovery program. During
appraisal, it was proposed that, as a first step toward financial self-
sufficiency, the Bank loan would be made directly to FELDA and that
FELDA/FELMILL would bear the full cost of borrowing.
3.02      FELDA staff prepared the project with Bank assistance and issued a
project report in August 1983. Special attention was given to mill justifica-
tion and timing, and construction of some mills was rescheduled or deferred in
light of oil palm planting progress and crop projections. Particular atten-
tion was also given to FELDA and FELMILL accounting and management information
systems, financial policies and procurement procedures. Project appraisal
took place in June 1984.
B. Project ObJectives and Brief Description
3.03      In support of the Government's land settlement program and institu-
tion-building efforts the project would: (a) strengthen FELDA/FELMILL palm
oil mill operations; (b) support FELDA's ongoing effort to strengthen its
corporate planning, budgeting, accounting and management information systems;
(c) support the Government's policy of financial self-sufficiency of public
nommercial enterprises; and (d) assist the Government to overcome Malaysia's
cttrrent balance of payments and fiscal constraints.
3.04      The project would include:
(a)  construction and commissioning for FELMILL of seven palm oil mills
with a total capacity of 351 ton FFB/hour during 1984-89;
(b)  provision of about 24 man-months of technical assistance to develop
and assist FELDA in establishing a computarized data-based system to
meet FELDA data processing requirements.

C. Project Features
Palm Oil Mills Component
3.05      The mills would provide fruit processing facilities for some 52,600
ha of oil palm entering into production during the period 1986-1991. The
mills would be located within six settlement complexes totalling some 105,500
ha of oil palm (see IBRD Map 18433). Four of the mills would be in peninsular
Malaysia and three in the State of Sabah (East Malaysia). Six mills would be
of a 54 ton FFB/hour capacity each, and one of 27 ton FFB/hour. Individual
mill construction and throughput have been justified on the basis of projected
oil palm production in each complex/scheme, after considering surplus FELDA
milling capacity within an economic transport distance (see Annex 3). The
proposed mills would increase FELMILL's current milling capacity by 13%.
3.06      Mills are designed to satisfy monthly crop processing demand during
the peak harvesting season. Monthly crop production at peak harvesting (about
three months a year) is estimated at 15% of total annual production; and mills
are projected to operate 500 hours per month during the peak season (25 days/
month x 20 hours /day in two 10-hour shifts). At off-peak, mills would
usually operate two 8-hour shifts a day. Thus, a standard mill of 54 ton
FFBfhour nominal throughput, rated at a net operating capacity of 50 ton
FFB/hour (see para. 3.07) would satisfy processing requirements of about 8,100
ha of oil palm, assuming an average yield of 20.6 ton FFB/ha.
Mill Design and Components
3.07'     The mills would be constructed to FELDA's current design for a mill
of 54 ton FFB/hour installed capacity, consisting of two production lines of
27 ton FFB/hour throughput each, including water and air pollution effluent
control facilities. To allow for equipment down time and reduced efficiency
due to heavy wear of press units, standard 54-ton mills are rated at 50 ton
FFB/hour throughput. This design has been developed after several years of
experience in FELDA and private mills in Malaysia, and is satisfactory. A
general mill layout is shown in Annex 4.1. The mills can be built in two
stages of 27 ton FFB/hour each, but investment costs for the first stage
account for about 85% of total cost. Thus, phasing is only justified when
full capacity is required long after initial mill completion (at least two
years) and the financial costs involved offset inconveniences associated with
construction of a second phase while operating the mill. This was considered
when reviewing the justification of specific mills under the project.
3.08      Mill components are categorized into four groups:  civil works,
mechanical and electrical works, machinery and equipment, and liquid effluent
treatment works. Civil works include office, service, workshop, storage and
factory buildings, staff quarters and a water supply and treatment plant. The
main factory building would be a steel structure with galvanized steel walls
and roofing. Other buildings would be built of brick and concrete blocks, and
plastered walls. Water supply and treatment facilities would be designed to
satisfy a processing demand of 1.5 cu m of water per ton of FFB, or
1 620 cu m/day.



- 11 -
3.09      Mechanical and electrical works include sterilizer bodies. storage
and handling machinery for palm kernel, steam distribution system, piping,
electric wiring and insulation works, produce loading ramps, oil storage tanks
and incinerators. Mill processing machinery and equipment consists of some 13
distinct and well-defined units as shown in the mill machinery layout in
Annex 4.2. Part of this machinery is imported and part can be manufactured
locally with imported parts and materials. A list of the units and general
characteristics of the machinery is given in Annex 4.3.
3.10      In compliance with Malaysian environmental standards, the proposed
mills liquid effluent would be treated before discharge into water courses.
Each mill would be provided with biological treatment facilities in two
stages. In a first stage, raw sludge would be treated in anaerobic deep ponds
designed for a 45-day retention period.  In a second stage, the ove-flow would
be treated in a series of oxidation ponds, namely facultative and algae ponds
designed for 20 and 7 day retention periods respectively (see flow chart of
mill effluent treatment process in Annex 4.4). After this treatment, liquid
effluent characteristics would be upgraded to: BOD: max 100 ppm; TSS: max
400 ppm; PH: 5-9; Temperature 450C.
Electronic Data Processing (EDP) Component
3. 11     FELDA began to use computer technology in 1972, and by 1975 had com-
puterized its payroll, settler pay sheets, settler loan repayments, and the
general ledgers. Data processing worked reasonably well through the mid-
1970s, but as FELDA's operations grew (now comprising 16 departments,
18 regional offices, 367 schemes comprising about 84,000 settler accounts, and
over 60 oil palm and rubber factories), the original EDP system can no longer
cope with the volume and complexity of FELDA's requirements. FELDA presently
leases a one mega byte mainframe (IBM 4331) with several micro computers, and
24 dummy and data entry hardware (IBM 5280). The major constraint for compu-
terization has been FELDA's accounting system, which was designed for separa-
tion of expenditures on the basis of activities and corresponding source of
funds, i.e., field development in the Loan Account, replanting in the Settlers
Replanting Account, headquarter's expenditures in the Administrative
Account. As the system was complex, standard software applications were not
available for FELDA's mainframe. FELDA was required to design and program an
array of independent systems along the lines of early batch systems of
computing. These various independent systems are no longer practical. The
present EDP system is inflexible, requiring multiple re-input of data in
several programs for credit to the appropriate accounts. Synchronization of
data and records is poor, resulting in accounting delays. Present systems are
not conducive to routine and timely management information, and data process-
ing contains frequent errors requiring constant reconciliation in the various
accounts.
3.12      Under the project, FELDA's EDP system would be improved by develop-
ing a data-base computer system to suit current accounting and reporting
requirements. The system would integrate all data pertaining to the FELDA
group operations, by introducing proper coding and simultaneous transmission
of data from the schemes and factories to branch offices and headquarters.
Independent consultants would develop a computarized data-base system, assist



- 12 -
FELDA in its implementation and train staff of the Data Processing Department
in the use of the system. Implementation of the data-base system would
require installation of microcomputers at the regional offices and
headquarters departments, for on-line transmission of data to the main
frame. Provision of this equipment would be financed out of FELDA's
administrative budget. FELMILL's present computer hardware, including an IBM
3034 mainframe and several micro computers, is considered adequate in the
short-term.
Status of Project Preparation
3.13      Although project appraisal was delayed (para. 3.01), implementation
proceeded as foreseen in FELDA's August, 1983 proposal. Final engineering
designs have been completed, and procurement and construction have started in
two mills, Sahabat A and Ulu Belitong. The Bank has been kept informed of
works progress, and procurement procedures for tenders issued after appraisal
have been in accordance with Bank guidelines, particularly regarding tender
periods, advertising, and bid evaluation. Final engineering design for the
remaining five mills would be carried out within the year prior to the start
of construction. Engineering would mainly consist of selection of mill sites
and water source, topographical surveys and adaptation of the standard mill
layout to local conditions. As the mills would be located in areas gazetted
for land development by FELDA, land acquisition would not be a problem.
D. Project Costs
3.14      Total project costs amount to US$62.1 million, including a foreign
exchange component of US$31.2 million, or 50% of the total. Base costs are
based on June 1984 prices adjusted to December 1984.  Project costs include
about US$6.5 million in taxes and duties. A physical contingency of 5% has
been included on civil works and 10% on consultant services. Since the mills
would be construieted to standard design with well defined units of machinery
and equipment and performance requirements (para. 3.09 and Annex 4.3), no
physical contingencies have been included for mechanical and electrical works
or machinery and equipment. Price contingencies amount to 17% of the base
cost and physical contingencies calculated on the basis of the following
expected price increases for both local and foreign costs: 8% for 1985, 9%
for 1986-88 and 7.5% thereafter. Details of total costs and a schedule of
investments are presented in Annex 5 and summarized in Table 3.1 below.

E. Financing
3.15      The proposed Bank loan of US$31.2 million would finance the
project's foreign exchange cost, or 56% of total costs net of duties and
taxes. FELDA would finance US$30.9 million. Sources and application of
project funds are shown in the Table 3.2.
3.16      The Bank loan would be made to FELDA with Government guarantee, for
15 years, including three years of grace. This would be a significant depar-
ture from the current practice whereby Bank loans are made to the Government
and onlent to FELDA on concessionary terms. FELDA would use about US$61.8
million of project funds for mill construction; upon commissioning of each
mill FELDA would transfer ownership to FELMILL at cost, 75% (US$46.4 million)
as subloans, and 25% (US$15.4 million) as equity. FELDA would onlend about
US$30.9 million of the Bank loan to FELMILL for 15 years including a 3-year
grace period during which interest would be capitalized, at the Bank's
standard variable interest rate. FELMILL would bear the foreign exchange risk
on its part of the loan. FELDA funds (US$15.5 million) would also be for 15
years including three years grace during which interest would be capitalized,
and would carry an interest rate of 7.5% p.a. The blend of FELDA and Bank
funds calculated with the current Bank lending rate would cost FELMILL about
8.7% p.a. The resulting rate would be positive given the Bank's estimated
local inflation rate for the foreseeable future. In accordance with current
practice, FELDA would lend project funds to FELMILL on a mill-by-mill basis.
During negotiations assurances were obtained that: (a) upon commissioning of
each mill, FELDA would transfer it to FELMILL at cost, 25% as equity and 75%
as subloans; and (b) the Bank portion of the subloans would be for 15 years,
including a three-year grace period during which interest would be capital-
ized, at a variable interest rate equal to that of the Bank loan; and FELMILL
would bear the foreign exchange risk. Signing of an agreement acceptable to
the Bank between FELDA and FELMILL outlining those conditions would be a
condition of loan effectiveness.

3.18      As the mills are dispersed geographically in Peninsular Malaysia and
in Sabah, and construction is phased over five years, construction contracts
are unlikely to be attractive to foreign contractors. Moreover, the local
construction and mechanical industries are well developed and experienced in
palm oil construction. However, to encourage participation of foreign
bidders, the following procurement procedures would be followed under the
project: Civil works contracts costing US$2.5 million or more and all mill
mechanical and electrical works, machinery and equipment contracts, would be
awarded after ICB, in accordance with Bank guidelines; civil works contracts
of less than US$2.5 million could be awarded on the basis of LCB procedures,
which are satisfactory. A margin of preference equal to 15% of the c.i.f. bid
price of imported goods or the actual custom duties and import taxes, which-
ever is less, would be allowed for domestic manufacturers. To the extent
possible works and goods would be packaged, by mill or groups of mills, into
contracts valued at US$2.5 million for civil works and $200,000 for mechanical



16 -
and electrical works, machinery and equipment. Contracts procured before
project appraisal (US$5.0 million), June 30, 1984, would not be eligible for
disbursement under the proposed loan. Consultants for the design of the
computerized data-base system would be selected in accordance with Bank guide-
lines. Mill construction engineering and supervision would be carried out by
FELDA staff (para. 4.01), and are therefore not subject to procurement.
Civil, electrical and mechanical works contracts over US$1 million each and
machinery and equipment contracts over US$500,000 each would be subject to
prior review. This will cover over 80% of the total value of all contracts.
Other contracts would be subject to selective post-award review.
G. Disbursements
3.19      The proposed loan would be disbursed against normal documentation as
follows: (a) 53% for civil, mechanical and electrical works; (b) 100% of
foreign exchange cost of directly imported machinery and equipment; or 65% of
supply, installation and commissioning contracts; and (c) 100% of total
expenditures for consultant services.
3.20      The loan is expected to be disbursed over six years according to the
following schedule of disbursements.

Loan Closing Date: June 30, 1991
3.21      A one-year lag between projected investments and disbursements has
been allowed to cover implementation and disbursement application delays.
However, disbursements under the project are expected to be faster than histo-
rical disbursement profiles for agricultural project_ in Malaysia. This is
because implementation of this project would be much less complex than that of
regular Malaysian agricultural projects comprising several components; and the



- 17 -
proposed mills, are a time-slice of an ongoing, and well defined, construction
program. Retroactive financing up to US$500,000 for expenditures under mill
construction contracts awarded after June 30, 1984 in accordance with Bank
guidelines is recomnended.
H. Accounts and Audits
3.22      Both FELDA and FELMILL maintain detailed accounts which are compu-
terized through to trial balances. While no major changes in accounting
practices are required, it is anticipated that they will be streamlined and
consolidated based on recommendations from the consultants work on accounting
and management information which began in mid-1984 (para. 2.07).  Audit
reports of both FELDA and FELMILL are completed by independent private
auditors within six months of the close of the fiscal year and are prepared
with detailed explanatory notes. As has been the case with previous Bank
projects, FELDA and FELMILL accounts and audit reports would incorporate the
project accounts. Assurances were obtained that FELDA and FELMILL would
furnish the Bank with their audited corporate accounts and financial state-
ments, inclusive of project accounts, within six months following the close of
their fiscal year.
I. Environmental Impact
3.23      The main environmental risk associated with the project would be
pollution by palm oil mill liquid effluent. However in compliance with
Malaysian law, which is strictly enforced, each mill would be provided with a
liquid effluent treatment plant (para. 3.10) to reduce biological and solid
contamination to safe levels; also to avoid air pollution the mills would be
sited at a minimum distance of 3 km f'rom residential areas and would be
equipped with smoke ash collectors. Malaysian Palm Oil Mill pollution control
standards are consistent with the Bank's Palm Oil Industry Guidelines, and are
satisfactory.
IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
Mill Construction
4.01      The project would be implemented during 1984-89 as shown in
Annex 6. Mill construction and commissioning would be the responsibility of
FELDA's Processing Department. The Department's own staff, which is qualified
and experienced, would carry out mill engineering, planning and design, con-
struction supervision and commissioning; its performance under previous Bank
projects has been satisfactory. In accordance with current practice, the
Department would periodically retain independent consultants to review and
update mill standard design and to assist in mill engineering, planning and
construction supervision. Works' construction, and supply and installation of
machinery and equipment manufacturir,-. and installation would be by contrac-
tors. Under the project, FELDA's procurement procedures would be enhanced
particularly regarding ICB tender documents, advertising and bid evaluation.
Before starting construction of each mill, FELDA and FELMILL, in consultation
with the Bank, would review its justification and timing in light of updated
crop projections and milling requirements. Assurances to this effect were
obtained during negotiations.



- 18 -
Hill Operation
4.02      Upon mill commissioning, FELDA would transfer mill ownership and
operation to FELMILL. Mill staffing, operation and maintenance would be in
accordance with current FELMILL practices. A Bank review of selected palm oil
mills showed that mill operation practices are generally satisfactory. How-
ever some mills are affected by fruit quality and processing and operation
control deficiencies. Deficiencies in fruit quality are mainly due to har-
vesting of unripe fruit by settlers, which results in reduction of oil and
kernel extraction rates. Deficient operation control affects mill throughput
and increases unit production costs. Deficient process control results in oil
losses and reductions in oil recovery efficiency. FELDA/FELMILL are taking
action to overcome these problems. Under the project, special attention would
be given to improving fruit harvesting practices by settlers and mill staffing
and operating practices. During negotiations assurances were obtained that by
December 31, 1985, FELDA would retain an independent consultant, acceptable to
the Bank, to follow up on the Bank's mill review and make recommendations on
additional actions to further improve FFB harvesting practices and mill
operations.
4.03      Staffing for a standard 54 ton FFB/hour mill normally consists of
the manager, two assistant managers (processing and maintenance), 26 technical
and administrative staff and about 82 workers. Mill managers and assistant
managers are mechanical engineer3, college graduates or diploma holders.
Other staff are usually high school or vocational school graduates. Staff
training is provided by FELMILL in cooperation with FELDA and the Malaysian
Oil Palm Growers Council (NOPGC). For engineers, this includes 11 introduc-
tory courses on mill operation and maintenance, management, accounting, etc.,
plus one month in a mill specially designed for and solely devoted to train-
ing. Other staff are given short introductory courses plus one year on-the-
job training prior to permanent appointment.
4.04      Mills would ordinarily operate 300 days per year in two 8-hour
shifts, or a maximum of 4,800 hours/year. In practice, however, actual opera-
tion would depend on FFB supply which in turn depends on seasonal and annual
variations of crop harvesting. During the three-month peak harvest season,
the monthly crop supply is 12.5%-15% of annual production and mills operate
two 10-hour shifts.  Other weather and settler related factors also influence
FFB supply, giving rise to short peaks and down time. Under normal operating
conditions, the individual mill capacity utilization factor, related to the
maximum hours of operation per annum, is 50% to 60%. Up to 1981 the average
utilization factor for all FELMILL mills was around 55%. With the commission-
ing of new mills between 1982-83 (para. 2.12) and an unexpected decline in
palm oil yields (para. 5.05), the utilization factor fell below 40%. With the
slow down in palm oil mill construction under the project, an expected
recovery in yields and with new areas entering into production, average utili-
zation for all FELMILL mills is expected to return to the 1981 levels by 1989.
EDP Component and Consultants
4.05      FELDA's data processing department would implement the EDP component
in cooperation with other departments ioncerned. Consultants terms of



- 19 -
reference for design of the computarized data-base system would be based on
recommendations of the ongoing budgeting, accounting and MIS review. This
work would begin in late 1985 for completion in 1986. During negotiations
assurances were obtained that: (a) FELDA would furnish to the Bank for
comment the consultants' proposals to improve its budgeting, accounting and
management information systems, and, based on such proposals, submit by
December 31, 1985, for Bank comment, an action plan for implementation; and
(b) by December 31, 1985, FELDA would retain consultants under terms of
reference acceptable to the Bank, to develop a computarized data-base system,
to assist FELDA on its establishment and train FELDA sta,'f in its operation.
Monitoring and Reporting
4.06      FELDA's Budgeting and Planning Department would be responsible for
project monitoring and reporting as for other Bank projects, which is satis-
factory, and would be enhanced by the MIS improvements (para. 2.07). The
monitoring and reporting of palm oil mills operation and operating costs would
be done by FELMILL under existing arrangements which are satisfactory (para.
2.08). Progress implementation reports would be submitted semi-annually; a
Project Completion Report would be prepared within six months of the loan
closing date.
V. PALM OIL MARKETING AND PRICES
Mills Output
5.01      By 1991 project mills would process an average of 1.1 million tons
FFB/year, with an expected output of 220,000 tons of palm oil and 45,000 tons
of kernel, which would be about 14% of projected FELMILL output. Total
ex-mill value of production would be about US$103 million at 1991 prices in
constant 1984 US dollars.
FELMILL Marketing and FFB Pricing Arrangements
5.02      Transport and marketing of Crude Palm Oil (CPO) and kernels are
handled by FELMILL for the settlers, in cooperation with two other FEWDA sub-
sidiary corporations: FELDA Transport and FELDA Marketing (FELMA). Marketing
strategies are determined by a joint committee of the three corporations on
the basis of FFB production projections. All sales are on short-term con-
tracts of up to four months. After deducting mill processing, transport, dis-
tribution and marketing fees, FELMILL passes on the proceeds of CPO and kernel
sales to the settlers through FELDA. FELMILL does not assume other than inci-
dental risks or partieipate in the benefits associated with palm oil and
kernel trading. In ,iractice, however, FELMILL purchases FFB from the settlers
at a price determined monthly through a formula, which reflects palm oil and
kernel extraction rates, ex-factory sale prices, and the FFB processing fee
charged by FELMILL (para. 6.08).
International Market Prospects
5.03      World consumption of vegetable oils, predominantly soybean and palm
oil, is projected to grow at about 3.2% p.a. in the period 1985-95, slightly



- 20 -
below the historical trend rate of 3.4% during 1970-82. In recent years the
demand for vegetable oils has grown faster in developing countries and this
trend is expected to continue. With expected higher population and income
growth rates, and higher elasticity of demand for vegetable oils, their share
of total oil consumption is expected to increase from 56% in 1982 to 60% in
1990, and 62% in 1995. The bulk of the increase is expected to come from palm
oil and soybean oil. The share of palm oil is expected to increase from 11%
in 1982 to 15% in 1995, faster than that of soybean, which is expected to
increase from 32% to 34% over the same period.
5.04      While world production of oil increased at a rate of 3.4% p.a.
during 1960-82, palm oil grew at 8.3% p.a. during the same period. The main
factor behind this has been the large increase in Malaysia's production, which
grew at about 20% p.a. since 1961, and now accounts for more than 50% of world
output, and about 70% of world exports.  Indonesia, the second largest
producer, with a growth rate of more than 12% p.a. produces about 14% of world
output. Future palm oil production is expected to continue to grow from 6.3
million tons in '982, to about 11.1 million tons in 1995 for an average growth
rate of 4.8% p.a. However, Malaysia's production is expected to slow to an
average rate of 4.5% p.a-. with the major increase in production coming from
Indonesia.
5.05      During the 1960s-1980s palm oil prices fluctuated greatly,
reflecting production fluctuations of both palm oil and soybean oil. In 1982,
prices fell sharply due to a dramatic increase in Malaysia's production caused
by the introduction of weevil-assisted pollination. In 1983 oil prices
recovered due to sharp drops in palm oil production in Malaysia, a combination
of hot dry weather and overstressed palms, and drops in soybean production in
the United States. Since July 1984, prices have declined again, reflecting
the excellent soybean harvest in South America, good prospects for the U.S.
soybean crop, and a strong recovery of Malaysia's palm oil production since
April 1984. Although demand prospects for vegetable oil are expected to
remain quite favorable, supplies are likely to remain plentiful, leading to a
general softening of prices. The following Bank long-term projections for
palm oil and kernel prices were used to estimate the value of palm oil and
kernel sales under the project:

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. FELDA's Financial Position
6.01      The financial position of FELDA is healthy, the result of sound
financial management and government support in the form of grants and loan
funds. Financial evaluation of FELDA operations is complex sinca its
accounting system comprises 15 separate accounts of revenue and expenditure.
As of December 1983, FELDA maintained total surpluses representing invest-
ments, fixed deposits, and cash on hand of about M$615 (US$267) million (see
Annex 7); the bulk of this providing liquidity for lending operations to
smallholders and its subsidiaries, particularly FELMILL, and equity invest-
ments (FELDA's Loan Account).
6.02      FELDA's financial strength has benefited from the spread in its
relending of Government funds to smallholders and its subsidiaries. Govern-
ment loans were for 20 to 25 years with 10 years of grace (five years interest
free and five years accrued interest) at 5 1/4% to 6 1/2%, which FELDA onlent
at 1%-2% above the borrowed interest rates for periods of 13 to 15 years, with
interest compounding during two to seven year grace periods. Additionally,
FELDA surpluses have accrued from management levies and replanting reserve
funds deducted from smallholders' accounts, and investment returns. FELDA's
investments are primarily in government bonds, fixed deposits, public compa-
nies and in FELDA subsidiaries. The return on equity investments in its
subsidiary corporations and joint ventures was about 16% in 1983.
6.03      As FELDA's financial strength has improved, the Government has
started to reduce FELDA's dependence on Government funds. In 1983, the
Government provided only 80% grant financing to support FELDA administration
and management levies, and the spread on relending operations have been
abandoned. Nevertheless, FELDA's cash availabilities would increase to about
M$1.4 billion or US$560 million by 1990, which is equivalent to about US$414
million in 1984 prices. This must be viewed, however, in the light of FELDA's
responsibility for maintaining settlers' incomes, which requires stabilization
reserves to take care of commodity price changes and other contingencies.
Furthermore, FELDA's cash is readily available to Government and is largely
used to purchase medium term government securities. This notwithstanding,
FELDA should consider revising its financial policies to further reduce
dependence on government grants for administrative expenditures, and
government subsidized loan funds for its operations. The proposed project,
under which FELDA would borrow directly from the Bank bearing the full cost of
borrowing and providing counterpart funds, is a step in this direction.
B.  FELMILL's Fina'-ial Position
6.04      FELMILL's financial position i- also sound, but is largely dependent
on FELDA which owns 93% of its equity and provides 100% of its loan funding.
Since establishment and operation of processing facilities depend on produce
availability from settlement schemes, capital expenditures by FELMILL and its
level of debt ultimately rest with FELDA. FELDA also influences the revenue
FELMILL obtains by participating in the setting of crop processing fees (para.
6.08). Financial policies of FELMILL to date have been sound and are

6.05      FELMILL's turnover has increased from M$221 million in 1975 to
M$1 billion in 1983. FELMILL's liquidity is low with a current ratio of only
0.69, but is expected to return to 1980 levels as the profitability and cash
flow improve under the project. FELMILL maintains a sound capital structure
with total equity of M$145.3 million at the end of 1983. FELDA evaluates the
borrowing capacity of FELMILL and provides fresh equity and loan funds on the
basis of a capital gearing of 75:25 including estimation of year-end retained
earnings. The debt equity ratio at the end of 1983 was 65:35. FELMILL's



- 23 -
dividend pay-out is considered high at about 505 of net profits. This is in
part due to the desire of FELDA to ensure maximum pay-out to the Investment
Corporation Company which in total owns about 7% of FELMILL equity (para.
2.04), but a lower dividend pay-out would reduce FELMILL reliance on FELDA for
borrowed funds.
6.06      In view of the initial low utilization of some palm oil mills
constructed in the early 1980s FELMILL's recent level of profitability has
been depressed, but it is expected to improve as overall utilization
increases. FELMILL's sustained profitability is assured since it can balance
its costs by increasing processing fees. Based on present projections,
FELMILL should have net profits in excess of M$36 (US$14) million by 1990. To
support its investment program in palm oil mills and rubber factories and
retain a sound capital structure in the corporation, FELMILL will continue to
require equity contributions from FELDA during the period 1985-88.
Mill Operating and FFB Processing Costs
6.07      Mill operating costs comprise:  (a) general charges including staff
salaries and benefits, insurance and general office expenses; (b) direct manu-
facturing charges, including fuel, chemicals, labor, packing and materials,
pollution control and maintenance; and (c) overhead, including headquarters
administration, depreciation, and interest. Processing costs per ton vary
with the ml-l utilization factor.  The relative weight of general and direct
manufacturing charges and overheads also vary with the mill utilization
factor, but they respectively represent around 10%, 40% and 50% of the ton FFB
processin-g cost. Over 1979-82, the average operating cost for all FELMILL
mills ranged between M$21 and M$22/ton FFB, but increased to M$30.82 in 1983,
due to an unusual drop in production from 4.6 to 3.7 million ton FFB and the
commissioning of new mills which raised overhead costs. While production is
expected to return to projected levels, the average FFB processing cost is
expected to remain around M$30/ton FFB, which is about the same level as
private sector mills.  However the FFB processing cost in Sabah is expected to
be around 20% higher than in Peninsular Malaysia, due to greater mill con-
struction costs.
Processing Fees
6.08      FELMILL's main income is primarily derived from oil palm and rubber
processing fees. For oil palm a nationwide FFB processing fee, known in
FELMILL as the "discount", is periodically fixed by FELMILL's Board in consul-
tation with FELDA, and the settlers. The discount is based on average FELMILL
FFB processing costs and a return to equity of about 16% which is reasonable.
Since 1981 the "discount" has been fixed at M$26.50/ton FFB. In August 1984,
a special M$2.50/ton FFB amortization surcharge was established for a total
fee of M$29/ton FFB, reflecting average processing costs for the first six
months of 1984. During negotiations assurances were obtained that: (a) at
the request of either party, FELDAJFELMILL and the Bank would exchange views
on the structuring of FELMILL's FF8 processing fees, including the intro-
duction of differential processing fees to account for higher than average
processing costs; (b) FELDA would ensure that FFB processing fees would be
reviewed periodically to ensure that they cover mill operating costs and



- 24 -
ensure an adequate return to FELMILL investments; and (c) FELMILL would take
all necessary actions to ensure that mill operations remain reasonably
competitive with mill processing costs in the Malaysian private sector.
VII. JUSTIFICATION
A. Project Benefits
7.01      The project would provide timely milling service to about 52,600 ha
of oil palm for the benefit of over 13,000 settler families and would generate
about 750 permanent employment positions. Palm oil and palm kernel production
and exports from the project mills would generate about US$113.9 million in
foreign exchange earnings to Malaysia by 1991, in 1984 US dollars. On insti-
tution building, the project would strengthen FELDA/FELMILL's mill planning
and operation capabilities and would support FELDA's ongoing efforts to
improve its corporate planning, budgeting, accounting, and management informa-
tion systems.  Also, FELDA's and FELMILL's bearing of the full cost of borrow-
ing, including the foreign exchange risk, for the first time, would support
the Government's aim to make public commercial enterprises financially self-
sufficient. Finally, the proposed loan would assist the Government to overcome
the country's current balance of payments and fiscal constraints.
B. Project Rates of Return
Financial Rate of Return
7.02      The project financial rate of return is estimated at 14%
(Annex 8). It was derived on the basis of: (a) volume of FFB processing
determined according to production projections in Annex 3; (b) palm oil and
kernel prices derived from Bank projections in constant 1984 US$, adjusted for
ocean freight, insurance, export duties, etc. to reach refinery price;
Cc) FELMILL's current average operating costs, and fruit processing fees
adjusted by 20% for the mills in Sabah to account for higher construction
costz and (d) mill construction costs including physical contingencies
(Annex 5).
Economic Rate of Return
7.03      The project economic rate of return (ERR) is estimated at 16%
(Annex 9). It was derived by adjusting the flows in the financial analysis as
follows: (a) on the benefit side palm oil and kernel financial prices were
coverted to economic prices by adding export duties, estimated at 8%*on oil
and 5% on kernel; and (b) on the cost side financial prices were adjusted to
economic prices by removing identifiable taxes and duties on palm oil mill
investments. The results of applying a sensitivity analysis to the project
benefits and costs show that the project remains viable across a range of
assumptions on volume of FFB processed, costs and prices. A production short-
fall of 15% reduces the ERR to 12%. An increase of 15% in investment costs
lowers the ERR to 13%. A production shortfall of 10% along with a 10%
increase in investment costs reduces the ERR to 12%. A switching value test
shows that investment costs would have to increase by 33%, or the volume of
FFB processed decrease by 20% to lower the EER to 11%, the opportunity cost of
capital in Malaysia.



- 25 -
C. Project Risks
7.04      The main risk associated with the project would be reduced milling
utilization due to lower than expected crop production. This would be caused
by lower planting rates or plant damage, and by oil palm yield reductions.
The risk of under-utilization would be overcome by reviewing mill justifica-
tion and timing in light of updated crop projections prior to beginning con-
struction of each mill (para. 4.01).
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
8.01      During negotiations assurances were obtained on the following
principal points:
(a) Upon commissioning of each mill FELDA would transfer ownership of
the mill to FELMILL at cost, 25% as equity and 75% as subloans; the
Bank portion of the subloans would be for 15 years with a 3-year
grace period during which interest would be capitalized; at the
Bank's standard variable interest rate; and FELMILL would bear the
foreign exchange risk (para. 3.16);
(b) before starting construction of each mill under the project, FELDA
and FELMILL, in consultation with the Bank, would review the
justification and timing in light of updated crop projections and
milling requirements (para. 4.01);
Cc) By December 31, 1985, FELDA would retain an independent consultant,
acceptable to the Bank, to follow up on the Bank's mill review and
make recommendations to further improve FFB harvesting practices and
mill operations (para. 4.02);
(d) FELDA would furnish to the Bank for comment the consultants'
proposals to improve its budgeting, accounting and management
information systems; and based on such proposals, submit by
December 31, 1985, for Bank comment, an action plan for
implementation (para. 4.05);
(e) by December 31, 1985, FELDA would retain independent consultants,
under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, to develop a data
based computer system, assist FELDA in its establishment and train
FELDA staff in its operation (para. 4.05); and
(f) FELDA would ensure that: (i) at the request of either party FELDA/
FELMILL and the Bank would exchange views on the structuring of
FELMILL processing fees including the introduction of differential
processing fees to account for higher than average processing costs;
(ii) mill processing fees would be reviewed periodically to ensure
that they adequately cover mill operating costs and ensure an ade-
quate return to FELMILL investments; and (iii) FELMILL would take
all necessary actions to ensure that mill operating costs and



- 26 -
processing fees thereby remain reasonably competitive with palm oil
mill processing costs in the private sector (para. 6.08).
8.02      A condition of loan effectiveness would be the signing of a transfer
agreement, acceptable to the Bank, between FELDA and FELMILL outlining the
conditions in 8.01 (a) and (f) above (para. 3.16).
8.03      With the above assurances, the proposed project would be suitable
for a Bank loan of US$31.2 million to be made to FELDA with the guarantee of
the Government of Malaysia. The loan would have a repayment period of 15
years, including a grace period of three years, at the standard variable
interest rate.

Mill Machinery and Equipment
Weighbridge
The weighbridge capacity normally installed is of 40-50 tons with a
platform 45 feet long.
Loading Ramp/Fruit Storage
Capacity of fruit storage ramp is normally calculated to provide
approximately 10-12 hours processing requirements, namely 500-600 ton FFB.
This unit can be manufactured locally, incorporating imported hydraulic
components and steel.
Sterilizers
The capacity of the sterilizers will provide a two hour cycle
time. A total capacity of 100 tons will be sufficient in four sterilizers of
25 tons capacity each. Sterilizers can be manufactured locally in Malaysia
using imported steel.
Overhead Cranes
Two overhead cranes would be installed, one for each production
line. Each crane would have a 2.5 ton lift capacity and operate in 4 minute
cycles for a total of 37.5 ton/hour per level, or 75 ton/hour per mill.
Threshing Machine
Threshing machines for removal of fruits from bunches are built to
handle a capacity of 30 tons FFB per hour. Two units are required and can be
manufactured locally, using imported drive units and steel.
Fruit Elevator
Fruit elevator of sufficient capacity to handle an FFB throughput of
30 tons FFB per hour. Elevator casings can be locally manufactured but
drives, chain sprockets and chains are imported.
Digester Press Units
Digester press units rated at 9-12 ton FFB per hour can be manufac-
tured locally. Six digester press units would be installed in a 54 ton per
hour mill. Reduction gear boxes used in digesters and press units are
imported as is steel for construction.

Clarification Station
The clarification station consists of continuous decantation tanks
and holding tanks for sludge, oil and water. Tanks can be fabricated locally
using imported steel. Oil purifiers, separators, and vacuum oil driers are
imported items. Two oil purifiers, four sludge separators and two vacuum
driers would be installed in a 54 ton per hour mill. These items are usually
imported.
Nut Cracking Station
Depericarpers, for separating of fiber and nuts, would be installed,
one for each machinery line. The machine, consisting of an air separating
column, fiber cyclone and nut polishing drum, can be manufactured locally from
imported steel. Drives consisting of motors and gear boxes, suction fans and
drives used in construction are imported.
Nut Silos, four pre-treatment (drying) of nuts prior to cracking,
are provided. The silo capacity is based on a detention time of approximately
18 hours and 18% nuts to FFB. For a throughout capacity of 54 ton FFB per
hour, 4 units would be installed. Silos are fabricated locally and air
heaters and fans are imported. Steel used for fabrication is imported.
Nut Crackers. A nut cracker is installed for each silo; four are
required for a 54 ton FFB per hour mill. The units can be fabricated locally
using imported steel.
Hydrocyclone Separators. For the separation of kernel and shell
after nut cracking, hydrocyclone separators are used. For a mill operating at
54 ton FFB per hour, 4 units would be required. Hydrocyclone units can be
constructed locally using imported steel.
Nut and Kernel Elevators. Elevator casings can be fabricated
locally, drives, chain sprockets, and chains and drives used in construction
are imported. Steel used for construction is imported.
Boilers
The total boiler steaming capacity required for production of 54
tons FFB per hour is 80,000 lbs steam per hour in two units each of 40,000 lbs
per hour capacity.
