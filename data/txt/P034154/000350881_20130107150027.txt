F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objectives (from Project Appraisal Document)
The objectives of the Project are to: (a) address the urgent port capacity requirement of the
Borrower up to the year 2005; (b) optimize the use of existing facilities by rehabilitating and
upgrading the two ports of Massawa and Assab; and (c) increase substantially the productivity
and capacity of the two ports to international standards.

Following the conflict with Ethiopia and the loss of Ethiopian transit traffic through Assab
(which accounted for 97% of the port's traffic), the project was restructured to cease further

                                                     v
project activities at Assab and to utilize the savings for a second phase of Massawa Port
rehabilitation and capacity enhancement in conjunction with ongoing productivity initiatives.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving authority)
The revised Project Development Objective is to increase the productivity and capacity of Port
Massawa.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.      The Ports Rehabilitation Project was a pioneer project in Eritrea financed by the World
Bank after Eritrea had gained its independence in 1993. The project was initially designed to
address the country’s infrastructure, severely damaged by the war, and substantially increase the
productivity and capacity of two ports – Massawa and Assab. A Bank-managed Trust Fund (TF)
financed by the Government of Italy was applied to close a project financing gap in the amount
of US$ 21 million. The Government of Netherlands provided parallel funding through a Grant
under the ORIET-Millieve Program. The project originally intended to provide financial and
technical assistance required to rehabilitate and upgrade the two ports, optimizing the use of
existing facilities, and to raise the quality and level of port operational services to the
international standards.

2.      However, two months after the project’s effectiveness the border conflict broke out
between Eritrea and Ethiopia (in May 1998), culminating into a full-fledged war during 1999-
2000, which had major implications on the project implementation and the performance of both
ports. The closure of the border during 1999-2001 and the tightened security measures that
followed subsequently made it difficult to carry out any project activities. With the border
conflict, the operations at the Port Assab ceased completely, and the Port of Massawa remained
as the major port for import and export of Eritrean cargo, though its total cargo throughputs
continued to decline. The project implementation did not resume until two years after
effectiveness.

3.      The delay in implementation and the cessation of Assab’s operations resulted in a
modification of the original project design of the project. Consequently, as part of the Mid-Term
Review (MTR) in December 1999, all Assab-related activities were removed and the funds
reallocated to support more improvements to the Massawa Port, given the absence of operations
in the Assab Port1.

4.      All Port Massawa activities including those added at the time of the MTR, had been
already completed successfully by the end of 2008, and the project could have been closed.
However, in 2008, responding to a critical condition of the oil jetty in Massawa and the urgent
need of the Government of Eritrea (GoE) to prevent its collapse, the team, in cooperation with
the European Union (EU), decided to support the financing of the emergency repairs of the oil
jetty and the construction of a new oil jetty under the project. As a result, the project was
restructured2 and the closing date was extended to December 31, 2011. The restructuring also
included formal revision of the Project Development Objective (PDO) by shifting its focus
entirely to the Massawa Port. The Bank team saw adding the new activity and extending the
existing project as a way of utilizing the project savings (in the amount of US$ 8.1 million
equivalent of International Development Association [IDA] Credit) and as the only possible
immediate solution to addressing the emergency situation in regards to the oil jetty. The TF
Grant from the EU provided the co-financing to help close the financing gap for the new activity



1
    At that time, under the World Bank procedures, the MTR was considered sufficient to restructure a project.
2
    Under the changed Bank Procedures, this restructuring followed approval of a Restructuring Paper.

                                                           1
(in the amount of EUR 13.23 million3). The EU-funding was provided with the agreement that
the Bank would supervise the implementation of the agreed activities.

5.      The emergency repairs of the existing oil jetty were completed in November 2008. The
contract for the new oil jetty construction was awarded in May 2010, but the works were
terminated unilaterally by the Government of Eritrea (GOE) on September 8, 2011 without prior
notice to or consultation with the Bank due to unsatisfactory performance of the Contractor.
Despite the advice and guidance of the Bank and the EU to extend the closing date to complete
the new oil jetty, the GoE made a decision to close the project due to uncertainty on the duration
of the dispute with the contractor. The IDA Credit and the EU Grant were closed on December
31, 2011. The IDA Credit reached a disbursement ratio of 79 percent of original credit (SDR 4.7
million, US$ 7.3 million equivalent, was cancelled), and the EU Grant was disbursed 45 percent
(EUR7.24 million, US$ 9.38 million equivalent, was cancelled). The Italian Grant was closed on
January 31, 2007, after achieving a disbursement ratio of 99 percent of original allocated amount
(only US$ 208,877 was cancelled). The GOE reimbursed the undisbursed amounts, and the
respective special accounts were closed.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

6.      Eritrea is located in the northeast of Africa, with a 1000 kilometer (km) coastline on the
Red Sea. Eritrea's population is estimated to be in the range of 6 million as of end 2011. A large
share of the population - nearly 80 percent - is engaged in subsistence agriculture, producing
only a small share of total output. The border conflict and continued tension with Ethiopia had a
negative impact on the availability of foreign currency in the country and limited private
enterprise activities. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for Eritrea at official exchange rate is
estimated at US$ 2.6 billion (2011) with 8.2 percent real growth rate (2011 estimate). GDP per
capita is estimated at US$ 700 (source: 2012 CIA World Fact Book).

7.      The transport sector is essential for the Eritrean economy and is one of the most
important sources of foreign exchange earnings. The transport infrastructure in the country was
severely damaged during the long war for independence, posing a major obstacle for the
country’s growth, especially by limiting access of producers to the markets. Ports and roads are
seen as the main constraints and priorities for improvement.

8.      The port of Massawa suffered from the damages incurred during the 30 years (until 1991)
of Independence War with Ethiopia. The damages were exacerbated by the collapse of about 40
meters of the block work quay wall at the junction of berths 5 and 6 in 1978. The performance of
the ports further declined due to the lack of maintenance and spare parts. The level of traffic
volume handled through Massawa and Assab was increasing during the years after independence
until early 2000s. Most of this traffic volume was transit traffic to and from Ethiopia. At the time
of appraisal, the poor condition and resulting low capacity of, especially the facilities at both
ports, were not appropriate for handling the known traffic volume increases, especially the
growing container volumes.


3
 This amount excludes the administrative expenses of the multi-donor TF by the Bank (the total EU pledge
amounted to EUR 13.5 million).

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDOs) and Key Indicators

9.      The original PDOs as stated in the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) were the
following: (i) address the urgent port capacity requirements of the Borrower up to the year 2005;
(ii) optimize the use of existing facilities by rehabilitating and upgrading the two ports of
Massawa and Assab; and (iii) increase substantially the productivity and capacity of the two
ports to international standards. The PDOs stated in the DCA, Staff Appraisal Report’s (SAR)
main text, and SAR’s Annex 6 differ slightly in its formulation across the three documents. The
PDOs and key indicators at the time of approval as per Annex 6 of SAR were as follows:

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

10.    Revised PDO: As a result of the border conflict with Ethiopia, which broke out two
months after the project effectiveness, delayed the implementation closed the border with
Ethiopia that led to the loss of traffic in Assab port, it became necessary to redesign the project in
line with the outcomes of the December 1999 MTR. The revised PDO was subsequently
confirmed during the September 2008 restructuring to the following: “To increase productivity
and capacity of Port Massawa.?

11.    Revised key indicators: At the time of restructuring in September 2008, some of the
Outcome Indicators for Massawa Port activities included in the original SAR, as shown below,
were retained, while other indicators related to “waiting, services and dwell time? and
“hazardous cargo and oil spill? were dropped. In regards to the Intermediate Results Indicators,
the Indicators-1 (c)-(e) below were introduced as new, whereas the Intermediate Results
Indicators-2 remained original as set in the SAR. The indicator targets were broadly attained,
except for the construction of a new oil jetty, which was terminated by the GoE.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.     Original in SAR: The original SAR briefly refers to “Ports of Massawa and Assab? as
the “Beneficiaries? of this project in its first page, titled “Credit and Project Summary?. No other
place in SAR mentions directly about the “Beneficiaries?. However, the Letter of Sector Policy
attached to the SAR addresses that the “Eritrea's Macro-Economic policy states that this country
aims to become a trading nation, the future prosperity of the people will depend on Eritrea's
international trade. As a matter of pre-condition to achieving this aim, there is need, alongside
other indispensable measure, to rehabilitate the facilities of the ports of Massawa and Assab, to
improve their performance, and make them competitive as well as addressing environmental
issues.? (Quoted from SAR Annex 4 Letter of Sector Policy dated Oct. 17, 1997).

13.     The revised Beneficiaries: In the Project Paper dated September 16, 2008, the
Beneficiaries were revised mainly to “Port Massawa?. Furthermore, as a result of restructuring
the project was expected to support Eritrea’s efforts to secure supply of oil to the country’s
economy at relatively lower costs, as well as to mitigate the risk of a potential environmental
disaster in the event of the existing jetty collapse leading to oil spillage. The capacity of the
proposed new oil jetty was expected to be significantly greater to permit bigger tankers to call at
the port reducing the shipping costs per ton. Considering the above, this project’s direct
beneficiaries continue being “the national economy as a whole? through improved port facilities,
efficiency, and security.

1.5 Original Components

14.     The project was funded by an IDA Credit of SDR22.20 million (equivalent to US$ 30.3
million at the time of appraisal), with co-financing from an Italian Grant of US$ 21 million,
administered by the World Bank as a TF. Both funding sources had identical development
objectives and disbursement categories, except that the Italian TF was limited to expenditures
related to the Massawa Port only. The IDA Credit covered both Massawa and Assab Ports.
15.      The project’s original design and scope comprised five components, namely: (i) civil
works (US$18.65 million) in Massawa Port only; (ii) cargo handling equipment (US$22.65
million) for both Assab and Massawa Ports; (iii) environment (US$1.6 million) for both ports;
(iv) training (US$0.6 million); and (v) consultancy services (US$4.5 million).

                                                       4
16.     Civil Works (US$ 18.65 million - basic costs). This consisted of the following, all in
Massawa Port: (i) rehabilitation and extension of berths 5 and 6; (ii) dredging in front of the new
berth 6; (iii) reclamation of land behind berth 6; (iv) heavy duty pavement for the new container
stacking yard; (v) clearing of the apron and storage areas adjacent to berths 5 & 6; (vi)
rehabilitation of the electrical and storm drainage systems; (vii) building for the port
administration and customs authorities; and (viii) a workshop, an equipment shed and
improvements to warehouses in the port.

17.    Cargo Handling Equipment (US$ 22.65 million). Most of the equipment included in this
component was for handling of containers for two ports to improve operational efficiency and
services provision.

18.     Environment (US$ 1.6 million). Operating practices regarding facilities and equipment
estimated at US$ 800,000 for each of the two ports were included to improve handling of
hazardous cargo, as well as control of discharge of bilge water, solid waste from ships and oil
spill combat equipment including support for formulation of a National Oil Spill Contingency
Plan with assistance from the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

19.     Training (US$ 0.6 million). Training programs in the fields of port operations and
equipment maintenance, including overseas training at recognized international institutes and/or
at overseas ports, and project management costs for the Project Coordination Unit (PCU).

20.     Consultancy Services (US$ 4.5 million). This included (i) works supervision at Massawa
Port; (ii) short term experts for equipment and spare parts procurement; (iii) specific studies on
maritime & port legislation, Management Information Systems (MIS), cost accounting, tariff
analysis and commercialization of port activities; (iv) a study on long term development plan of
the port sector; and (v) short-term technical advisory services in port management & operations
and equipment maintenance.

1.6 Revised Components

21.     During the MTR, an agreement was reached on the modifications to the original project
components as a response to the two year delay in project implementation, the cessation of
Assab’s operations and the continued border tensions between Eritrea and Ethiopia. During the
restructuring of September 2008, the previous revisions were confirmed and new activities were
introduced as a response to the risk of collapse of the oil jetty in Massawa.

22.     Components as revised during the December 1999 MTR: Due to the border conflict,
the team revised the project scope by dropping the Assab-related sub-components and focusing
entirely on the improvements in the Massawa Port. The other original activities pertaining to
Massawa Port remained unchanged, except the construction of a new building for the port
administration and customs authorities, which were dropped in line with the recommendations of
the Technical Assistance (TA) on port management to secure free space in the port. Also, the
following two new activities were added: (i) improvement of Massawa causeways at Sigalet and
Dahlak, expansion of the container terminal, and purchase of additional port equipment; and (ii)
Phase II rehabilitation works in Massawa Port, which included the rehabilitation of pavement

                                                5
with concrete blocks behind berths 3-5, rehabilitation of port road network inclusive of new
internal access roads, railing construction for 15-ton shore cranes, fencing around the container
terminal area, raising of the sea walls to protect container stacking yard, construction of lighting
towers, and rehabilitation of the water tower.

23.      These revisions to the project were introduced as part of the MTR in December 1999, as
at that time, under the World Bank procedures the MTR was considered sufficient to restructure
a project. Accordingly, the IDA and the Italian Grant were amended to accommodate these new
developments, and the closing dates for both instruments were extended to September 30,2006
and later to January 31, 2007 and for the DCA thereafter to September 30, 2008 through three
temporary extensions pending a restructuring.

24.      Components revised at 2008 restructuring: Since the Assab oil refinery and oil jetties
have since long stopped operations, the fuel supply has been handled at Massawa. The existing
oil jetty, built during the later periods of the Italian occupation of Eritrea, was in poor condition
facing imminent collapse – which could lead to disruption of fuel supply as well as deleterious
environmental damage. The new activities were added to the project, such as (i) the construction
of a new oil jetty (under a Design & Build contract method) to replace the existing one and (ii)
the emergency repairs of the existing oil jetty to extend its service life until replacement. In
addition, the project closing date was extended to December 31, 2011 and the informal revisions
made to the project during MTR were formalized in 2008.

1.7 Other significant changes

25.     Financing arrangement: The original Project cost was estimated at US$57.6 million in
the initial project design. IDA's contribution was US$ 30.3 million (53 percent of the total
project cost). Italy co-financed US$21 million of the cost of the Massawa components under an
untied grant. The State of Eritrea financed the local component of the project, equivalent to
US$ 6.3 million. To allow the completion of the activities, the Italian TF was extended three
times: to June 30, 2004, then to September 30, 2006, and later to January 31, 2007.

26.    At the time of restructuring in September 2008, most of the project activities (including
those added at the time of the MTR) were completed. The EU Grant Agreement for EUR 8.5
million was signed by IDA on July 7, 2006 and countersigned by the Government on
August 7, 2006, which was later amended in December 30, 2008, increasing the Grant amount
to EUR 13.23 million 4 towards co-financing of the construction of the new oil jetty and
extending the closing date to December 31, 2011, with an end disbursement date of April 30,
2012 (project financing details are provided in Annex 1).

27.    Termination of Construction of New Oil Jetty: The emergency repair of the existing oil
jetty was completed in November 2008; the new oil jetty construction works were awarded in
May 2010; and the Contractor commenced works in December 2010. But, the construction
works on the new oil jetty were terminated by the GOE due to unsatisfactory performance of the
Contractor. The GoE decided not to request an extension of the closing date of neither the IDA

credit nor the EU Grant, as the government was uncertain how long the respective contractual
issues would take to resolve, considering the project was already over-age (over 14 years) and
several extensions had already been granted. Both the IDA Credit and the EU Grant were closed
on December 31, 2011.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

28.    Project Preparation: In May 1995, a study was funded by the Danish Trust Fund to: (i)
prepare an overall port development program for Massawa (Phase I for the year 1995 to 2005)
including traffic forecasting and engineering works for the rehabilitation of Berths 5 and 6; (ii)
prepare a program for improvements in port operations; and (iii) recommend appropriate
improvements in administrative and management systems. In line with this development
program, the project was designed and was appraised in April 1996.

29.    IDA involvement: The rationale for IDA involvement was that Eritrea being a new state
and no longer part of Ethiopia, needed assistance; IDA was previously involved in the port sector
in Ethiopia (Assab) and was experienced in taking the lead role in formulating port
modernization programs in neighboring countries along the east coast of Africa.

30.     Risks and Mitigations: SAR addressed the importance “to minimize risks and uncertainty
as to the local capacity and lack of experience of the Department of Maritime Transport (DMT)
and the two ports to implement and manage the project?. This was addressed through the
establishment of a PCU at an early stage of project implementation. A coordination manager, an
accountant and a procurement specialist were recruited before the project effectiveness (by
March 1998) and trained on contract management, procurement, and financial management
policies and requirements.

31.     The risks to the implementation of civil works as stated in SAR (a period of about two
years for berths 5 and 6 in Massawa) were concerning the port area becoming heavily congested
during the contractor's works. To mitigate the risk of delays during construction, the SAR
provisioned that the contract documents included specific and detailed clauses on phasing of the
works and modalities for coordination with the operations department. The PCU/Massawa Port
Administration (MPA) confirmed that the phasing of the works was included in all the contracts,
and the works sites were handed over to the contractors upon completion of the preceding
phase/s, whereby minimizing congestion.

32.    The political risks such as the outbreak of the war were highly understated during project
preparation and appraisal, and “pull-out? options or alternative arrangements were not
considered. However, the team should have reassessed the situation at the time when the conflict
began and introduced appropriate mitigation measures. While the SAR addressed the “risks and
uncertainty as to the local capacity and lack of experience of DMT and the two ports to
implement and manage the project?, it was not anticipated that the potential border conflict could
adversely affect the capacity of the PCU/DMT staff after it was put in place with sufficient
capacity. The GOE was committed to recruiting additional staff in the MPA and PCU/DMT to
make up for the manpower shortage caused by the deployment; however, the loss of experienced

                                                7
staff, especially in procurement and project management, posed a major risk to achieving the
PDO. Some of these risks were minimized later during implementation through the launch of the
International Labours Organization (ILO) Port-worker Development Program (PDP) in 2003.
The Program was funded under the project and aimed to enhance local port sector performance.

2.2 Implementation

33.     As mentioned earlier, the unexpected break out of the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia
two months after project effectiveness delayed the project implementation by two years and
affected adversely the ports’ performance. This led to the loss of all operations in Assab Port,
and the subsequent post-conflict environment necessitated revisions in the project design and
scope, which were carried out through the MTR in December 1999. The activities related to
Assab Port were cancelled, new project activities in the Massawa Port were introduced, and the
closing date was extended to June 30, 2005. The implementation of the project experienced
serious challenges and slow progress immediately following the war during 2000-2002. This
was mainly due to the staff shortage and inadequate capacity of the PCU, emanating from the
continued border tensions with Ethiopia, the resulting deployment of the Port staff to the national
service, and restrictions and constraints imposed by the GOE that was preoccupied more by the
political conflict rather than the project. The Aide Memoire dated June 7-17, 1999 already
reported the delays of the audit reports and the project account whereby identifying the reason of
the departure of the key staff.

34.     The original task team composition was also not fully suitable for the efficient and
successful project supervision and for adequate risk management. The Quality Assurance
Group’s (QAG) assessment of Quality of Supervision (QSA5) in 2002 also highlighted (i)
insufficient efforts of the project team to make alternative arrangements by hiring consultants
when it was found not practical to get at least key persons for after the end of the war to resume
the work at Massawa port; and (ii) inadequate Bank management inputs in the context of the
severity of problems facing the project.

35.      In 2003, the Bank task team was strengthened by including an experienced procurement
specialist and accredited civil engineer with highways and ports background. This enabled to
steadily address the procurement delay and process the necessary extensions of IDA Credit and
Italian TF closing dates. As a result, procurement process was improved and implementation
progress picked up as acknowledged by the QSA6 (2004) in the following way: (i) the Bank and
the supervision team had put a major effort into redressing the project implementation
constraints, (ii) procurement of civil works and equipment supply was following a tight schedule;
(iii) the Bank had repeatedly encouraged the implementing agency to employ the services of
additional consultants to replace staff on national service duty; (iv) job training to the staff of
PCU, MPA and DMT was provided; and (v) both country and sector management had increased
their attention to this project and provided not only good advice but also the necessary budget to
supervise the project closely in order to bring it to a successful completion. To enhance local port
sector performance and build capacity of the port workers, the project team launched the
International Labours Organization (ILO) Port-worker Development Program (PDP)
implemented and funded under the project. As a result, PCU and the MPA capacity were
strengthened and the project management and implementation advanced steadily, though with
some delays time to time.

                                                 8
36.    To account for the slow implementation progress after the MTR restructuring, the team
extended the project closing date to June 30, 2007. With the strengthened Bank team’s
implementation support, a significant progress in implementation was made during 2004 – 2007,
leading to a successful completion of the major components by the beginning of 2007.

37.    By 2008, all project activities were completed successfully, as revised, including (i)
Massawa causeways at Sigalet and Dhalak; (ii) rehabilitation of Berths 5 and 6; (iii) extension of
the container terminal; (iv) purchase of port equipment and spare-parts; (v) environmental
management equipment; and (vi) various studies and technical advisory services. These activities
had significant impacts on increasing the capacity and improving performance of Massawa Port.
The Key Performance Indicator values provided in Annex 2 demonstrate the trend pertaining to
these improvements from the appraisal to closing date. The detailed completion status of
individual components is provided in Annex 3.

38.      In September 2008, the Bank team made a decision to restructure the project again in
order to add new activities on emergency repairs of the oil jetty and the construction of a new oil
jetty in Massawa. The decision was a reaction by the Bank team to the urgent need of the GoE
to take immediate measures to prevent the collapse of the oil jetty in Massawa and to replace it
with a new one. The rationale behind the decision of the Bank team and management to add
these new activities and extend the project’s life rather than closing it, lies within the following
logic: (i) risk of a potential environmental disaster in the event of the existing jetty collapse
leading to oil spillage required urgent and immediate action; (ii) provision of financing under a
new IDA project was not available to Eritrea at the time. The GoE decided at the time not to sign
the supplementary letters on non-concessional borrowing, a requirement to be eligible for IDA-
support; (iii) savings were available under the existing project in the amount of the uncommitted
IDA funds (SDR 5.3 million or US$ 8.1 million equivalent at the time of restructuring) that
could be utilized and relocated towards the construction of a new oil jetty.

39.     The Bank saw adding these new activities and extending the existing project not only as a
way to utilize the project savings, but as the only possible immediate solution to addressing the
emergency situation in regards to the oil jetty. The TF Grant from the European Union provided
the co-financing to help closing the financing gap for the new activities in the amount of EUR
13.2 million.5

40.    Consequently, the construction of a new oil jetty and emergency repairs of the existing
one were added to the project in 2008 as new activities with the new project closing date of
December 31, 2011. The emergency repair of the existing oil jetty was completed in November
2008 extending its service life temporarily until the completion of the new jetty. The contract for
the new oil jetty construction works was awarded to a Contractor on May 11, 2010 for a 22
month contract period.




5
 This amount excludes the administrative expenses of the multi-donor TF by the Bank (the total EU pledge
amounted to EUR 13.5 million).

                                                       9
41.     However, the construction works were substantially delayed (only five percent of the
progress was achieved – soil investigation and ground survey in nearly nine months out of the 22
month project period) due to the contractor’s unsatisfactory performance, possibly resulting from
lack of information of the soil conditions during the bidding stage. The delay in releasing the
Advance Payment, which was the main prerequisite for commencement date under the contract,
also partially contributed to the delay of commencement of the works. By the time of the project
closing date, no main works had started, though the initial preparatory activity associated with
ground survey and soil investigation for the sub-structure had been carried out by the contractor.
Consequently, the contract was terminated by the GoE in September 2011.

42.     At the time, the Bank suggested to the GOE to extend the closing date to allow the
completion of works, but the GOE decided to close the project on time and terminate the contract.
As a result, the GOE took over the project sites, against which the contractor submitted claims
for financial settlement of about US$ 14.06 million. During the preparation of this ICR, both the
Contractor and the Client were still in the process of seeking an amicable settlement to resolve
the claim. Meanwhile, the emergency repair carried out on the existing jetty continued to
weaken posing major potential environmental, human, and economic risks to the country. The
GOE intends to complete the construction of the new oil jetty once the outstanding issues with
the previous contractor are resolved. The Bank supports any efforts by the GOE that would
avoid environmental disaster arising from non-completion of the new oil jetty.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

43.     Some of the original indicators were dropped in the process of restructuring. The key
performance indicators as restructured were used effectively to track project implementation and
to assess progress towards meeting the PDO. To facilitate the data collection and monitoring, the
PCU was established timely (prior to the project effectiveness date), and its capacity was
strengthened through training and computerized network software enabling the PCU to monitor
and track project progress in procurement, disbursements, and implementation.

44.     The measured data were reported on a regular basis in an agreed format in Quarterly
Progress Reports (QPRs) with updated details of the quarterly progress of project
implementation, including a set of key performance indicators on improvements in cargo
handling capacities and operational productivity. This enabled a continued and consistent M&E
of the project inputs, outputs and outcomes. This ICR also relies substantially on the M&E data
and information provided in the QPRs.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

45.    Environmental Safeguards. This project was assigned an environmental category A, due
to the scale of potential environmental impacts of the port rehabilitation activities, including
dredging activities, improvement to navigation aid and repairs of the existing oil jetty and
construction of the new jetty. According to project safeguards documentation, the Environmental
Datasheet (EDS) in 1997 and subsequent Integrated Safeguards Datasheets (ISDSs) prepared in
2008 for project restructuring, only OP 4.01 was triggered by the project, whereas the ISRs
included compliance ratings for OP 4.11 – Physical Cultural Resources. As improvement to
environmental management of the Port was central for one of the components, environmental

                                               10
safeguards were, for the most part, mainstreamed into the project design. Based on the project
documentation, compliance with environmental safeguards was mostly rated as satisfactory
throughout the life of the project. That is, with one exception when the Port component was rated
unsatisfactory, due to consultants’ failure to produce an adequate Environmental Management
Plan (EMP) on time, which was later corrected.

46.     Throughout the project Aide Memoires, it is however recognized that there were no
critical contaminations caused by the reclamation and coastal environmental damage by the
dredging reported and/or claimed. On one occasion there was a minor oil spill caused by leakage
from a ship scrapyard. The project team took the opportunity to use this in the development of a
Contingency plan and training at quarterly intervals. During civil works, there were no repeats of
oil spills reported - and with procured equipment and enhanced staff skills in environmental
management, ship wastes were collected and disposed in line with international practice – and a
National Oil Spill Contingency Plan was established with assistance of the Port Management TA
consultant, and required equipment was procured. With regards to the physical cultural resources
in the project area, a mosque, located next to berth 6 and registered as historically significant
national cultural heritage, was subsequently not structurally affected as part of the port civil
works. The Project rather improved the preservation of the site by stabilizing the foundation of
the mosque and constructing a surrounding retaining wall.

47.    Based on the project categorization, to satisfy requirements for environmental assessment
an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) was developed as part of the Port Master Plan in
January 1996. In accordance with the Bank policy, the EIA was carried out by an independent
EA expert, not affiliated with the project. This EIA covered the original project activities,
including recommendations on carrying out the dredging. The EIA identified a number of
environmental issues related to construction were, especially related to the dredging, land
reclamation and waste and hazardous material treatment.

48.     For the purposes of project restructuring in 2008, a separate Environmental and Social
Impact Assessment (ESIA) was prepared by an independent expert to cover the emergency
repairs on the existing oil jetty and construction of a new oil jetty both at Hirgigo Bay and
Massawa. The ESIA has identified impacts of the seven jetty design/siting alternatives and
provided pragmatic management guidance on oil spill control and fire risk. The final Assessment
report, disclosed in March 2008, included the ESIA with EMP, “Oil Spill Risk Assessment and
Contingency Plan? and “Fire Risk Assessment and Fire Training Plan?.

49.     Social Safeguards. The project triggered no social safeguards policies. Consultations
with the stakeholders confirmed that the project activities required no physical displacement of
people or economic displacement or limitation of access to the project-affected communities.
However, the EIA consultants recommended that the proponents could improve project social
responsibility by providing funds for the Manzanar Mangrove Project, which would improve the
situation of villages to the east of the project site as well as enhance biodiversity and fisheries
stocks in and along the Hirgigo Bay. The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) were
engaged in a Coastal Zone Management that included attention to fisheries and mangrove
protection. As for the physical cultural resources safeguard policy, these studies also predicted
no likelihood of chance finds.


                                                11
2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

50.      In accordance with the data presented on the Performance Indicators (PIs) (see Annex 2),
the project objective “to increase productivity and capacity of Port Massawa?, as revised in the
Project Paper, has been broadly met, except for the construction of the new oil jetty, which was
terminated by the GOE, and the container traffic target, which still far exceeds the baseline. The
existing oil jetty being old poses a potential risk of collapse, which may not only lead to a major
environmental disaster, but also have seriously adverse economic impacts and jeopardize the
sustainability of the achieved PDO. It is encouraging that completing the .construction of a new
oil jetty remains a top priority of the GOE in the post-project follow-up phase, and any support
toward this effort should be embraced.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

51.     At the time of project preparation, the project objectives were in line with the Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) goals for Eritrea, dated February 5, 1996. The long-term goal stated
in the CAS was to build a modern, technologically advanced, export-oriented economy, which
would capitalize on Eritrea’s strategic position and natural resources and private investment. The
CAS sought to accomplish this objective by (i) creating an environment in which the private
sector would develop and flourish, in partnership with foreign investors; (ii) reducing
infrastructure constraints; and (iii) investing in human resources.

52.     Port infrastructure damaged by the conflict with Ethiopia, also due to lack of
maintenance and spare parts, had been the major constraint on growth, especially limiting the
importer’s and exporters’ access to the global market. As such, the project provided not only the
improvement of the port facility/infrastructure, but also various types of cargo and container
handling equipment, spare parts, tools and improvement to warehouses, equipment sheds and
workshop – along with various port studies, TAs and trainings. The presented performance
indicators demonstrate a proof of the project achievements.

53.     Interim Strategy Note (ISN dated May 15, 2008) which was for the period of Fiscal Year
(FY) 2008 – FY2010 only (Eritrea does not currently have a full CAS) addresses two pillars (a)
support human development, and (b) support basic infrastructure development – whereby
concentrating on implementation of the existing portfolio – including this Port Rehabilitation
Project. In which sense, there is no substantial change since the 1996 CAS. Accordingly, the ISN
further addresses how the economic growth is hampered by the state of the existing infrastructure
network (transport, energy and telecommunication) restrictions – and it acknowledges the
contribution of the Massawa Port Rehabilitation which is largely rehabilitated and in use.

54.    Bank Group Assistance Strategy: 2008 ISN for Eritrea analyzes that the GOE’s
commitment to economic reforms and improving transparency dissipated during the previous
ISN period (FY2005-FY2007) as the transition and reforms did not prove to be GOE’s priorities
under the unresolved security situation. Nevertheless, ISN acknowledges progress at sector level
– taking port sector as one of examples, stating that “Productivity indicators at the port show
bulk cargo is now shifted at a rate of 2,152 tons per hour, compared to 850 tons per hour in the

                                                12
base year despite a decline in traffic at the port?. And as an assistance strategy, ISN further
addresses that the Bank should be ready to further support economic reforms to spur growth
benefiting from the sector investment.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

55.      The PDO has been achieved in regards to improving the productivity and reducing
congestion of the Massawa Port. Through the investment in works and equipment carried out in
Phase I and II the physical capacity has been substantially enhanced and the Massawa Port
productivity has generally increased over the life of the project. Considering that all project
activities as per the revised PDO have been completed, except the new oil jetty construction
cancelled by a unilateral decision of the government, the PDO can be considered achieved.

56.     The project indicators do not provide an accurate account of the attainment of PDO, as
they are not fully consistent with the activities implemented under the components, which is an
issue of project design at entry (discussion later). Nevertheless, the performance indicator
targets were achieved during some years, with some substantially exceeding the targets as shown
in the figures/graphs in Annex 2. The only exception is the container traffic, which exceeds its
baseline at appraisal and follows a consistently positive trend but falls below the target levels,
mainly due to the Ethiopian border closure and, to a lesser extent, the lack of appropriate ship to
shore handling equipment (Gantry Cranes, etc.).

57.     As for the port traffic, the Massawa port traffic remained relatively static relative to the
regional traffic growth, reflecting the level of economic activity in Eritrea in the post-border
conflict situation, with the import/export levels continuing to affect shipping costs and traffic
volumes. For example, the container cargo rate to Massawa is reported to be twice that of the
rates for other ports in the region.

3.3 Efficiency

58.     Given that the funds were reallocated from the Port Assab associated sub-components to
additional activities in Port Massawa, this ICR reviews the economic returns pertaining to the
Massawa Port investment only. The total Massawa investments for the original components
were evaluated at appraisal to generate an estimated economic internal rate of return (EIRR) of
45 percent and net present value (NPV) of US$28 million (at 12 percent). The economic analysis
was revised at the restructuring stage in light of newly introduced improvements in Massawa
(construction of new oil jetty and emergency repairs on the existing oil jetty). The benefits from
the new oil jetty were expected to be high yielding EIRR of 17.9 percent and NPV of US$6
million (at 12 percent). The ex-post EIRR for the Massawa Port (excluding the new oil jetty) is
estimated at about 42 percent with NPV of US$ 29 million, which is only slightly lower than the
appraisal estimate of 45 percent without the new oil jetty. The difference is barely significant
and the result is far in excess of the cost of capital and very robust. Even if the annual benefits
from 2006 until the end of the period were to be third of what was expected and the operating
costs were doubled, the final EIRR would decrease to as low as 35 percent only, which still is
significantly justified. Moreover, even if the original forecast traffic were half of low forecast
values from 2005 onwards, impact on EIRR would not be significant and the project investment


                                                13
would show economic viability at even very low traffic volumes. (Annex 4 provides details on
the analysis).

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59.     Relevance of Project. Though the post border conflict situation heavily affects the
volume of port transportation declining in total throughputs, the Massawa Port remains as the
major port for import/export of Eritrean cargo still carrying 98 percent of the entire cargo for
Eritrea. ISN acknowledges the contribution of the Massawa Port Rehabilitation, and the GOE’s
priority remains addressing the importance of the Massawa Port – including the construction of
the new oil jetty – as the key for development and national security.

60.     Achievement of PDO. The PDO has been achieved as far as improving the productivity
and reducing congestion of the Massawa Port and the project outcome indicators have been
largely achieved, except the container traffic, explained by the lack of appropriate ship to shore
handling equipment (Gantry Crane), though it registers a substantial increase from the baseline.
However, the termination of construction of new oil jetty raises a concern regarding the
sustainability of the achieved targets given the importance of environmental risks, thus bringing
down the overall outcome rating.

61.     Project Efficiency. The project efficiency was hampered by a lengthened age of the
project (14 years and 1 month), and slow implementation progress at initial stages emanating
mainly from (i) the effects of the war and continued border tensions with Ethiopia and (ii)
inadequate capacity of qualified and experienced staff at the time of entry and various periods of
implementation. Furthermore, the project failed to implement its last activity – construction of
the oil jetty. This notwithstanding, the project was one of the pioneer projects for Eritrea soon
after attaining independence, with no prior experience of the Borrower in managing Bank or
other donor financed projects, and despite the war and challenging post-war conditions, all other
project activities (as restructured) were completed with no cost overruns.

62.     Thus, the overall project outcome is rated Moderately Satisfactory, given the overall
weight of satisfactory outcomes for the (informally revised) project activities at the MTR stage.
The failure to complete one activity, the construction of the new oil jetty, to take advantage of
project savings confirms the lower than Satisfactory rating.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

N/A

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

63.     Implementation of the Letter of Sector Policy (dated October 17, 1997): The
Government indicated in its Letter of Sector Policy that it proposed to introduce a number of
financial and legal changes in the port sector. The Letter gave an implementation timeframe of


                                               14
five years for these changes, and specifically indicated that the terms for on-lending IDA funds,
and the financial obligations for the port sector would be defined by the end of 1999.

64.     However, the border conflict made it difficult for the GOE to move forward with the
reform, and some of the basic data for determining financial restructuring were not immediately
available. Consequently, in March 2004, the GOE accepted the recommendations provided
through the port management technical assistance in respect to new Draft Maritime and Port
Legislation, along with the technical assistance in revaluating the Massawa Port assets and
developing new proposed tariffs. By enacting the Maritime Port Legislation, the Massawa Port
would have been established as an independent authority. Nevertheless, according to the PCU,
only a few actions were undertaken in 2005 including establishing Massawa Port Authority.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

N/A

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: High

65.     The risk to development outcome for the project is rated High due to the presence of too
many unknown factors in regards to sustainability of the project results, availability of resources
to maintain the port infrastructure and equipment provided by the project, and the unknown
capacity of the MPA staff to secure funding for construction of the new oil jetty. Moreover, lack
of information on the financial performance of the Massawa Port and its costs and revenue
structure leave doubts as to availability and adequacy of funds and presence of a government
strategy to maintain the new infrastructure and equipment.

66.     At the time of project restructuring, when most of the activities were completed despite
the continued border tension with Ethiopia, the main potential risk flagged was the “threat to
peace in the region which could limit the interest by international contractors for the construction
of the new oil jetty, reduce availability of adequate manpower from the Recipient, and therefore
delay the construction of the new oil jetty?. Also identified was “the risk of potential collapse of
the existing jetty while the completion of the new oil jetty is delayed?. At completion, the risk of
potential collapse of the existing oil jetty still remains due to the termination of construction of
new oil jetty, posing serious concerns about both adverse economic and environmental impacts,
which jeopardize the achieved PDO. In addition, the ongoing dispute between the GOE and the
contractor may result in more follow up complaints coming to the Bank from the contractor.
Thus, the risk rating is High.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

67.    By the time of Board presentation, the physical components of the project were ready for
implementation as the design and implementation of project components were well identified,
design documents were ready and available, and the preparation of bidding documents was well
advanced.

68.      However, the overall quality of the performance of the project team and the Bank as an
institution at entry is considered Moderately Satisfactory due to the inconsistently designed
outcome indicators and the inadequate capacity of the Bank team responsible for the project
preparation. The original task team composition at entry lacked the appropriate skillset (e.g., port
engineer, procurement specialist) and capacity for efficiently designing the port specific project
and adequately addressing the associated implementation risks. The indicators designed by the
Bank team at entry are not fully aligned with the components and the PDO.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

69.      The quality of Bank team’s supervision is rated moderately satisfactory as the team’s
performance during supervision was mixed during different periods. The need to strengthen the
Bank team by bringing on board an experienced ports expert during the early stage of
implementation was not addressed until 2003. Up to that time there was a resulting lack of
technical support for addressing implementation issues. Further, when the redeployment of key
port staff to serve at the border tremendously constrained project implementation, the Bank could
have responded timely through a more forceful high-level dialogue to address the problem and
potentially strengthen the role of external consultants to assist the Client.

70.     In early 2003, the Bank team was added procurement and financial management staff,
safeguards specialists and accredited civil engineer with highways and ports background, who
joined the supervision missions that took place more regularly from then on. This helped the
Bank supervision to address the project implementation constraints and follow all the QAG
(QSA5) recommendations. As a result, the implementation progress was significantly improved
and delays minimized, as acknowledged by the 2004 QAG (QSA6). To account for the slow
implementation progress after the MTR restructuring, the team extended the project closing date
to June 30, 2007. With the stronger support from the Bank supervision team, significant progress
was achieved during 2004 – 2007, leading to a successful completion of the major components
by the beginning of 2007.

71.     The Bank team overall has been responsive to reflect on the changes following the war in
1998-2000, and quickly agreed with the GOE on the modifications to the project components
carried at the MTR in December 1999. The Bank was also quick and flexible in restructuring the
project to respond to the emergency situation with respect to the collapsing oil jetty in Massawa
and took a more challenging road by adding new activities to the already over-age and

                                                16
problematic project, so as to respond to the GoE’s immediate need in the atmosphere of a
strained relationship between the GoE and the Bank.

72.     The flexibility of the Bank helped to take advantage of the project savings and leverage
the donor-provided TFs to close the financing gap at different stages of the project. Once the
Bank implementation support was strengthened, the team was persistent in raising the capacity
issues of the PCU and streamlining training opportunities within the project to help improve the
PCU’s project management and implementation progress.

73.     The poor performance of the contractor, appointed to design and construct the new oil
jetty, and the uncertainty on the time required to settle the contractual claims after contract
termination, led the GoE to decide not to seek an extension of the Closing Dates for the EU
grant and IDA credit. This was compounded by an overall adverse relationship between the
GOE and the Bank. Therefore, a large portion of the EU Grant (EUR7.24 million equivalent to
US$9.38 million) and IDA credit (SDR 4.75 million equivalent to US$7.33 million) was
undisbursed. The documents availed do not record that the Bank team pursued a higher level
dialogue to resolve this situation.

74.     Procurement: The project team during the first five years of project life lacked a
procurement expert, resulting in a number of procurement delays. After strengthening the team
with procurement expertise in 2003, the procurement was improved and delays addressed.
Despite the long life of the project, the specialized nature of many contracts, and excluding the
cancellation of the new oil jetty construction contract before closing date, procurement was
overall adequately carried out and completed. Procurement issues that emerged were addressed
as appropriate and no problems of fraud and corruption were encountered by the project closing.

75.      Financial management: The project was assessed to be in full compliance with the
financial management (FM) arrangements. Adequate accounting capacity was put in place and
maintained throughout project implementation. The FM supervision on the Bank side was
effective, and the Borrower was diligent in timely submissions of all quarterly and annual
financial reports, which reported on project funds of all donors, namely IDA, Italian Grant, EU,
and GOE, and were satisfactory to the Bank. The project received unqualified/clean audit reports
and no material internal control weaknesses were flagged by the auditors in the management
letters, with the final report submitted in FY11. There are no outstanding financial reports and
audit issues on the project.

76.     Legal and environmental implications and reputational risks: The Project closed in
December 2011, before the civil works on the new oil jetty were concluded and after the
Government had unilaterally terminated the civil works contract for non-performance. The
World Bank sent a formal correspondence to the GOE conveying the need for the project
extension to allow for completion of the works and warning of the potential environmental and
economic risks from the collapse of the existing jetty. The Government declined the extension of
the project. The Bank team’s last visit of the site concluded that the existing oil jetty had
weakened over time and faced a real danger of collapse. The collapse of the oil jetty would
seriously impact Eritrea’s economy as it is the main inlet for fuel imports. There is also a serious
environmental risk. The GOE assured the Bank team that it was committed to completing the
construction of the new jetty, once the outstanding issues with the previous contractor were

                                                17
resolved. Unless the outstanding issues are resolved and works on the new oil jetty are completed
in the near future, the environmental risk remains, and so does the reputational risk of the GOE
and the Bank.

77.     Safeguards: There was a high level of input from the senior environmental safeguards
staff after a specialist was assigned to the project, four years after project became effective,
ensuring the environmental safeguards requirements were met. Any deficiencies appeared to be
quickly diagnosed and corrective support applied without major delay, including preparation of
additional safeguards instruments when necessary (see Section 2.4 for a detailed discussion).

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

78.      The overall Bank performance at the time of entry was characterized by inadequate
skillset in the team and inadequate risk management, which was not addressed until 2003, when
the team was strengthened with fiduciary and port engineering expertise. The Bank team,
however, responded quickly to the changed situation post the border conflict, and by the time of
the MTR the project restructuring had already been agreed with the GOE. The Bank also
responded quickly to the emergency situation with respect to the collapsing oil jetty in Massawa
and took a more challenging path by adding new activities to the already over-age and
challenging project, so as to respond to the GoE’s immediate need in the atmosphere of a
strained relationship between the GoE and the Bank.

79.     The flexibility of the Bank helped to leverage the donor-provided TF co-financing and
redirect the uncommitted funds under the Credit and the donor-provided TFs Grants to close the
financing gap at every stage of restructuring. Once the Bank implementation support was
strengthened, the team was persistent in raising the capacity issues of the PCU and streamlining
training opportunities within the project to help improve the PCU’s project management and
implementation progress.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

80.     The Borrower performance is mixed reflecting the changed GOE priorities as a result of
the border conflict and the post- conflict economic situation, and considering that this was one of
the pioneer projects for Eritrea soon after attaining independence, with no prior experience in
managing Bank or other donor financed projects. At the stage of the project preparation, GOE
well recognized the challenges and established the PCU in advance of the project effectiveness.
The GOE remained supportive of and committed to achieving the project objectives
notwithstanding the effects of the war and continuing border tensions with Ethiopia and made
efforts by recognizing the urgent need to strengthen the MPA and the PCU, which had lost its
skilled/experienced staff to the national services. However, it took some time before some of the
key staff were actually mobilized.

81.   The construction of a new oil jetty under the project was a top priority for the GOE. The
government was strongly committed to implementing this activity and even made a decision to


                                                18
fill in the financing gap from its own sources, when the contract price for the construction works
far exceeded the amount initially allocated through the EU grant and IDA credit. The civil
works contract was, however, terminated by the GOE unilaterally due to the contractor’s poor
performance without prior notice to or consultation with the Bank, which was not consistent with
the Bank’s procurement policies. Though the GOE still expresses its intension to complete the
new oil jetty, it is difficult to support the GOE’s decision not to extend the EU Grant and IDA
Credit closing date despite the Bank’s strong recommendation to do so.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

82.     The rating of the implementing agency performance is Moderately Satisfactory. The
project implementation was the responsibility of the Ministry of Transport and Communication
(MTC) through the Department of Maritime Transport (DMT). The Ports of Assab and
Massawa were established as autonomous commercial entities under the supervision of the
Ministry. The DMT is responsible for policy and regulation, including planning and
programming of the development of maritime transport capacity, safety, environment and other
supporting services. The Project Coordination Unit (PCU) was established under the DMT and
located at the Port Liaison Office in Asmara.

83.    The implementing agency was well organized and engaged in open discussions with the
Bank team in resolving critical issues. The PCU submitted financial reports to the Bank that
were timely (well in advance of stipulated 45 day deadlines). The reports were reviewed and
found in the form and content satisfactory to the Bank. Audit reports and management letters
were similarly submitted in advance of stipulated six month deadlines, including final audit
report and management letter for FY11. The audit reports were unqualified/clean, and no
material internal control weaknesses were flagged in the management letters.

84.     During the time of mobilization of many of the public service staff into national service,
including many of best qualified PCU/DMT staff, the PCU/DMT capacity to implement the
project and efficiently run its operations was put under tremendous strain. The Bank team
insisted in resolving this problem, as mentioned earlier, to demobilize some of the mechanical
staff as well as to further strengthen the PCU. As a result, the GOE increased capacity by hiring
some local consultants, demobilized some of the staff, and implemented training programs.
Some capacity was built through the ILO PDP funded under the project. Today, the PCU/DMT
continues operating after the project closing date to ensure that any outstanding issues are
sufficiently followed up.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

85.     The implementation (and thus disbursement) of the project was slow at the earlier stage
due to various constraints imposed by the unexpected border conflict, the continuing post-
conflict situation, and limited human resources in the PCU. However, despite the shift in
national priorities from economic development to national defense, the project activities were
fully completed as restructured, except for the new oil jetty, the PDO has been broadly achieved
and the PI targets met, except for container traffic, which still shows a positive trend and exceeds

                                                19
the baseline. As such, given that the contract issuance process for the construction of new oil
jetty was delayed and subsequently terminated unilaterally by the Borrower without any prior
notice to the Bank team, posing a serious environmental and sustainability risk for the achieved
PDO, the overall Borrower performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

86.      Restructuring a project in a timely manner to respond to changed circumstances is
likely to increase the chances of achieving intended project results. However, the timing and
relevance of injecting additional resources and introducing new activities towards the tail end of
implementing a project should be assessed critically. It may work if the new and additional
activities involve increasing the scope of works or introducing new activities that entail similar
works or activities without any significant changes or introducing new players. Other types of
activities could (i) complicate the institutional and implementation arrangements, (ii) imply
injecting new skills in the project implementation team, which may not be readily available; (iii)
lead to expanding coordination structure to include the new players and thereby disturbing an
arrangement that otherwise would have been tested over the years. For instance, the introduction
of construction of new oil jetty brought into play new institutions, such as Petroleum Corporation,
Eritrean Power Corporation and Ministry responsible for Energy, leading to complications in
implementation.

87.     Difficult operating business and/or political environment in a country does not
preclude having a successful project. Understanding the political economy and allowing for
flexibility in Bank procedures, notably in procurement, helps in designing and subsequently
executing appropriate interventions to emerging issues, such as failure on the part of contractors,
suppliers, or consultants to respond to advertised contract tender requests. This said, determining
the life of a project should take into account the country specific circumstances. For countries
emerging from a conflict or a new state, with inadequate capacity, consideration should be made
to having relatively much longer implementation periods accompanied by intensive capacity
building and if necessary financing the project operational costs, and also investing in building
local “ownership? and commitment to the project. On the part of the Bank adequate budgets
should be provided for supporting intensive and targeted implementation missions to overcome
emerging issues early enough.

88.     Pooling resources for a project from multiple donors reduces the transaction costs for
the Recipient through streamlined procurement processing and implementation arrangements,
but also increases the coordination and administration costs for the Bank project team. This is
compounded by a situation where the Recipient is a new state, as it involves intensive
supervision on the part of the Bank. However, the project presents a success story in leveraging
and managing the donor-funded TFs to help closing the financing gap, especially in situations
requiring responsiveness and flexibility to changes.

89.     Risk assessment and risk management/mitigation measures for projects in fragile
states should not underestimate the political risks and include “pull-out? options or alternative
arrangements. Having an appropriately defined risk assessment with mitigation measures would
assist project teams to recognize any events potentially impacting project implementation and
respond quickly with appropriate mitigation measures to still achieve successful implementation.

1.      The original Project cost was estimated at US$57.6 million in the initial project design.
IDA's contribution was US$ 30.3 million (53 percent of the total project cost). Italy co-financed
US$ 21.0 million of the cost of the Massawa component under an untied grant. The State of
Eritrea financed the local component of the project, equivalent to US$ 6.3 million.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

1.       Completion status of project activities and pending activity: Due to GOE’s decision
to close the project, one of the major components, namely the construction of a new oil jetty at
the Hirgigo Bay, had to be excluded. Below is a completion status summary of the main
activities. (Reference is made to Annex 3 prepared by the PCU for detailed status of the
components and activities).

2.      Original project components: The project has throughout been funded by an IDA
Credit of SDR 22.20 million (equivalent to US$ 30.3 million at the time of appraisal) together
with an Italian Grant of US$ 21 million, which IDA administered as a Trust Fund (TF). Both
funding sources had identical development objectives and disbursement categories, although, the
Italian TF was limited to expenditures related to Massawa Port only, whereas the IDA Credit had
allocated funding for both Massawa and Assab Ports.

3.     The original project design and scope had five components, namely: (i) civil works
(US$ 18.65 million); (ii) cargo handling equipment (US$ 22.65 million); (iii) environment
(US$ 1.6 million); (iv) training (US$ 0.6 million); and (v) consultancy services (US$4.5 million).

4.      Civil Works (US$ 18.65 million - basic costs). These included, all in Massawa Port, (i)
rehabilitation and extension of berths 5 and 6, (ii) dredging in front of the new berth 6, (iii)
reclamation of land behind berth 6, (iv) heavy duty pavement for the new container stacking yard,
(v) clearing of the apron and storage areas, (vi) rehabilitation of the electrical and storm drainage
systems, and (vii) construction of a building for the Port Administration and Customs Authorities,
a workshop, an equipment shed and improvements to warehouses in the port.

5.     Cargo handling equipment (US$ 22.65 million). Most of the equipment included in this
component was for the handling of containers in the two ports to improve operational efficiency
and services provision.

6.      Environment (US$ 1.6 million). Facilities and equipment estimated at US$ 800,000 for
each of the two ports were to improve the handling of hazardous cargo, bilge water, solid waste
and oil spill – formulation of a National Oil Spill Contingency Plan with assistance from the
International Maritime Organization (IMO).

7.      Training (US$ 0.6 million). Training programs in the fields of port operations and
equipment maintenance, including overseas training at recognized international institutes and/or
at overseas ports, and project management costs for the Project Coordination Unit (PCU).

8.       Consultancy Services (US$ 4.5 million). This included (i) works supervision at Massawa
Port; (ii) short term experts for equipment and spare parts procurement; (iii) specific studies on
maritime & port legislation, MIS, cost accounting, tariff analysis and commercialization of port
activities; (iv) a study on long term development plan of the port sector; and (v) short-term
technical advisory services in port management & operations and equipment maintenance.

9.     Revised project components: During the MTR, an agreement was reached on the
modifications to the original project components as a response to the two year delay in project
implementation, the cessation of Assab’s operations and the continued border tensions between

                                                27
Eritrea and Ethiopia. During the restructuring of September 2008, the previous revisions were
confirmed and new activities were introduced as a response to the risk of collapse of the oil jetty
in Massawa.

10.     Activities as revised during the December 1999 MTR: Due to the border conflict, the
team revised the project scope by dropping the Assab-related sub-components and focusing
entirely on the improvements in the Massawa Port. The other original activities pertaining to
Massawa Port remained unchanged, except the construction of a new building for the port
administration and customs authorities, which were dropped in line with the recommendations of
the Technical Assistance (TA) on port management to secure free space in the port. Also, the
following two new activities were added: (i) improvement of Massawa causeways at Sigalet and
Dahlak, expansion of the container terminal, and purchase of additional port equipment; and (ii)
Phase II rehabilitation works in Massawa Port, which included the rehabilitation of pavement
with concrete blocks behind berths 3-5, rehabilitation of port road network inclusive of new
internal access roads, railing construction for 15-ton shore cranes, fencing around the container
terminal area, raising of the sea walls to protect container stacking yard, construction of lighting
towers, and rehabilitation of the water tower.

11.      These revisions to the project were introduced as part of the MTR in December 1999, as
at that time, under the World Bank procedures the MTR was considered sufficient to restructure
a project. Accordingly, the IDA and the Italian Grant were amended to accommodate these new
developments, and the closing dates for both instruments were extended to September 30,2006
and later to January 31, 2007 and for the DCA thereafter to September 30, 2008 through three
temporary extensions pending a restructuring.

12.     Activities revised at 2008 restructuring: Since the Assab oil refinery and oil jetties have
since long stopped operations, the fuel supply has been handled at Massawa. The existing oil
jetty, built during the later periods of the Italian occupation of Eritrea, was in poor condition
facing imminent collapse – which could lead to disruption of fuel supply as well as deleterious
environmental damage. The new activities were added to the project, such as (i) the construction
of a new oil jetty (under a Design & Build contract method) to replace the existing one and (ii)
the emergency repairs of the existing oil jetty to extend its service life until replacement. In
addition, the project closing date was extended to December 31, 2011 and the informal revisions
made to the project during MTR were formalized in 2008.

13.     The Italian Grant was closed on January 31, 2007 after having achieved a 99 percent
disbursement rate and having completed 100% of the activities satisfactorily. Responding to the
project restructuring, the EU provided a Grant of EUR 8.2 million – later increased to EUR 13.2
million8 (US$20 million equivalent as at restructuring; US$ 17.14 million equivalent at exchange
rate as of September, 2012) – to finance the new project activities – which meant that the total
project cost increased from equivalent US$ 57.6 million to US$ 76.6 million (US$ 80.32
equivalent as of September 2012, accounting for exchange rate fluctuations) – leveraging close
to US$50 million against the IDA’s US$ 30.3 million.

14.   Activities remaining incomplete – Termination of construction of new oil jetty: The
completion of the new oil jetty has been the top priority of the GOE. The emergency repair of the

    This amount excludes the administrative expenses of the multi-donor TF by the Bank.
                                                         28
existing oil jetty was successfully completed in November 2008 extending its service life by
some years until its function would be taken over by a new oil jetty.

15.     The contract for the construction of the new oil jetty was awarded in May 2010 for a 22
month period. However, due to delays in providing advance payment to the contractor and
commitment from financiers, the contract startup was delayed by five months and was declared
effective on December 6, 2010. The contractor after having received advance payment was
anticipated to mobilize with all its power, but contrary to expectations was very slow and lacked
the drive to meet his obligations. Until the GOE unilaterally terminated the contract on
September 8, 2011, the only work done by the contractor was site survey and soil investigation,
the results of which have not been submitted to the PCU. This in itself encountered many
problems. The mission was informed that the final report is yet to be submitted.

16.     IDA came to know of the GOE’s action only after the contractor directly wrote to the
Regional Procurement Manager (RPM) for its intervention. IDA informed the GOE that
unilateral termination of contract was not procedural and advised that it should have had notified
the Bank prior to the action. The Bank’s letter also stated that this unilateral action would entail
adverse impacts and that the GOE should be aware that it would bear all responsibilities
associated with its actions. Despite the Bank’s advice to extend the EU Grant and IDA’s closing
date, the GOE expressed its decision not to do so. The GOE has informed the Bank team of (i)
its commitment to complete the construction of new oil jetty by all means using its own and
other resources; and (ii) its ongoing discussions with the Contractor on settling the matter
amicably, upon which a contractor will be hired to complete the construction under a new
contract.

17.    The delay in the construction of the new oil jetty may lead not only to a serious adverse
economic impact, but also to an environmental disaster, if the existing oil jetty collapses. The
mission considers that a high-level dialogue between the GOE, the European Commission and
the Bank is therefore imperative to resolve this critical/fatal issue and formulate a new project to
complete the new oil jetty – without which the achievement of the PDO will never be sustained
and the entire country would face a very serious economic crisis.

handling rates during the implementation were set as presented in Tables 1 and 2 below:

                                                                           was performed in two phases: Phase 1 was completed in 2002, whereas
                                                                           the second phase started in 2004 and completed in 2008.

1.3 Consultancy Services
1.3.1 Consultancy Services for Feasibility Study, Preliminary
                                                                          Under the Ports project, the Consultancy services comprised:
Design, Detail Design, Preparation of Bidding Documents and                     o Design and Supervision of above listed works
Assistance in Procurement of Contractors                                        o Master Plan Study for Massawa Port, Commercialization Study
                                                                                  for Assab, Provision of Technical Assistance for Massawa Port (in
                                                                                  New Management, Operations, Financial Management and Tariff)
                                                                                o Small Consultancy services to the Project Coordination Office in
                                                                                  production of tender documents, specification for procurement of

                                                                           34
            equipment etc.
   The Contracts for Design and Supervision of the finished works are
    simultaneously completed. The Master plan and Commercial studies are
    dully complete. Concerning the Provision of Technical Assistance
    Contract, the design phase of it was completed, but the Second phase,
    which mainly consisted of training and implementation of the accepted
    design proposals, never materialized mainly due to the inability of the
    Consulting firm to produce acceptable/satisfactory reports, particularly to
    the Financier.
   All the small Consultancy services under the project were satisfactorily
    completed.
   The only incomplete Consultancy Service contracts under the project are:
         o Supervision Contract for Hirgigo Petroleum Jetty, the reason being
           that the Works contract associated with this consultancy service is
           terminated as mentioned above.
         o Consultancy Services for Feasibility Study, Preliminary Design,
           Detail Design, Preparation of Bidding Documents and Assistance
           in Procurement of Contractor: The design for piling foundation
           (approximately five percent of design) is still outstanding. MPA
           went into bidding with the captioned design incomplete pertaining
           to unavailability of site survey and soil investigation. The
           unavailability of site survey and soil investigation results, in turn,
           was attributed to failure to find a suitable local and foreign
           Contract that is capable/interested to carryout out site survey and
           soil investigation. Consequently, the responsibility was transferred
           to the main contractor. At this point in time, despite the fact that
           the results of site survey and soil investigation have been provided
           to the Consultant, they kept delaying the delivery of the remaining
           final design, for reasons which are not acceptable to MPA. In view
           of the above, we are not just unable to have 100% design, but also

Annex 4. Economic and Financial Analysis

1.      The economic and financial assessment at appraisal was considered separately for
Massawa and Assab Ports, with the economic return for the overall project expected at 45.5
percent and net present value (NPV) of US$ 43 million at 12 percent discount rate. These
estimates were based on an assumption of the Assab being the main transit port for Ethiopian
trade, as at the time it handled 85 percent of Ethiopia's external trade, and being seen as a major
revenue and employment generating enterprise for the Eritrean economy. The actual economic
return for the overall project is different from that of appraisal calculated in 1997 due to
restructuring and removal of the Port Assab related investments from the project. Given that the
funds were reallocated from the Port Assab associated components towards additional
improvements in Port Massawa, this ICR reviews the economic returns pertaining to the
Massawa Port investment only.

2.       The total Massawa Port investments for the original components were evaluated at
appraisal to generate an ERR of 45.2 percent and a NPV of US$28 million (at 12 percent). The
economic analysis of the Massawa Port investment was revised at the restructuring stage in light
of newly introduced investments with funds reallocated from Assab sub-components, such as
construction of a new oil jetty and emergency repairs of the existing jetty. The benefits from the
new oil jetty alone were estimated to be high generating an ERR of 17.9 percent and NPV of
US$6 million (at 12 percent), as the new oil jetty was assumed to reduce unit shipping costs as a
result of economies of scale from allowing bigger tankers to call at the port. Additionally, the
ERR for the whole investment in Port Massawa was expected to be greater than the appraisal
estimate due to the high benefits to be accrued from the new oil jetty. These benefits were to be
generated as a result of mitigation of risks of potential environmental disaster and of consequent
disruptions in oil imports. However, given that the new oil jetty was not constructed under the
project, this ICR does not include an assessment of the economic returns pertaining to the new
oil jetty.

Productivity and Capacity of Port Massawa: Appraisal Estimates and Actuals
3.     Achievement of the project outcomes was measured at appraisal and restructuring by the
four key indicators, grouped in two categories – productivity and capacity – almost all of which
have achieved the set targets by 2005 or even exceeded them during the subsequent years. The
only exception is the container handling productivity, which is lower than the target set at the
appraisal (12 TEUs/hour) but still exhibits a positive trend from 3 to 8 TEUs/hour from 1997 to
2010.

4.      The trade traffic and productivity values in the Massawa Port exhibited a sudden drastic
decrease starting 2008 and onwards, which can be explained by the overall decline in trade
volumes worldwide due to the world economic and financial downturn observed during that
period.

Productivity indicators:

          Bulk Cargo: target for 2005 was 1,100 tons/ship/day; the actual achieved was 1,525
           tons/ship/day, exceeding the target by almost 40%. Since then, the break cargo has

                                                36
           reached 2,688 tons/ship/day (2008); but by end of 2010 fell short to 436
           tons/ship/day, which can be explained by the worldwide decline in trade.
          Bagged Cargo: target for 2005 was 1,200 tons/ship day; the actual was 877
           tons/ship/day for the year, falling short by about a quarter. Since then, bagged cargo
           reached 1,154 tons/ship/day (2009); but fell to 666 tons/ship/day by end of 2010,
           which can be explained by the worldwide decline in trade.
          Break Bulk: target for 2005 was 260 tons/ship/day; actual for the year was 467
           tons/ship/day, far exceeding the target by 80%. Since then the break bulk varied in
           the range of 112 to 500, with latest reported 257 tons/ship/day by end of 2010.
          Containers (TEU/hr): target for 2005 was 12 TEUs/hour; actual for the year was 8
           TEUs/hour, falling slightly short by a third. Since then number of TEUs/hour
           remained steady at 8, but decreased to 6 by the end of 2010, which can be explained
           by the worldwide decline in trade.


Capacity indicator:

          Berth Occupancy: target for 2005 was 67% down from 70% baseline; the actual in
           2005 was 55%, exceeding the target. Since then the capacity increased with berth
           occupancy varying from 28% (2007) to 52% (2010).

5.      As of end December 2008, the performance results reflect an overall increase in
productivity for every category of Port Massawa activity compared to the base year. The two out
of the five indicators, bulk cargo and break cargo tons per ship day at berth, surpass the end of
project targets while the rest exceed the base values.

6.      In accordance with the berth occupancy indicator, the capacity of the port has improved
significantly due to the investment. The decline in the berth occupancy rate from 70% to 40% in
2008 and 52% in 2010, which exceed targeted 67%.

Project costs: Appraisal Estimates and Actuals
7.      Overall, the actual total project costs were slightly lower: actual cost being US$ 57.4
million compared to US$ 57.6 million originally allocated. If broken down, the cost of the civil
works in Massawa Port, which accounted for about 40% of total financing originally (in the
amount of US$ 22.4 million), was actually higher, resulting in the net over-run of about US$ 5.6
million or about 25 percent. This over-run can be explained by additional investments redirected
to the Port of Massawa after cancellation of Assab Port sub-components, which originally did
not include any civil works. Less than the allocated costs was spent on the consulting services
and studies under the project, leading to an under-run of about US$ 8 million or 30 percent. The
equipment and training costs were greater than the appraisal cost estimates, with the actual costs
being higher by about US$ 1 million (less than 20 percent). These differences are mainly because
of reallocation of costs at restructuring.

8.     The costs accrued during the preparatory activities associated with the new oil jetty
construction are considered as overheads within the overall project costs for the purposes of this
analysis. The costs of emergency repair of the existing oil jetty are treated as capital costs and
are embedded in the overall project costs for Massawa investment.


Traffic: Appraisal Estimates and Actuals
Traffic Forecast at Appraisal
9.      The traffic forecast at appraisal was carried out for the years 2000-2005 and was based on
the following assumptions: (i) annual GNP growth of 7.5 percent to 2000 and 5.0 percent
thereafter; (ii) annual population growth rate of 2.7 percent; and (iii) annual agricultural growth
of 6 percent. The demand assumptions for individual commodities were based on forecasts made
by the relevant Ministries and the GNP elasticities.

10.     The estimation of traffic forecast at the appraisal was challenged by extremely limited
data, rudimentary state of statistical databases in Eritrea, the small size of the economy
recovering at the time from many years of civil war. A large proportion of port traffic was
traditionally food imports, volumes of which depended heavily on the harvests in Eritrea,
Northern Ethiopia and Ethiopia generally. Given these uncertainties, the forecast of future traffic
was treated with caution and additional weights were given to the sensitivity analysis for
variations in traffic levels. The economic returns from high and low traffic scenarios were also
tested, and the investment was found to be economically justified under any level of traffic. The
project was justified as a short-term capacity enhancing investment, irrespective of the traffic
scenario, and even under the low traffic scenario, a satisfactory rate of return was expected.
Assuming political stability, marked increases in both GNP and agricultural production were
expected to stimulate the rise in total port traffic, under the central forecast, from 633,000 tons in
1994, to 870,000 tons in 2000, and 1,005,000 tons in 2005.

Actual Traffic Levels
11.    The traffic forecasts, made at appraisal, would require major re-assessment to take into
account the factors unexpected at the time, such as, impact of the war in 1999-2000, the post-war

                                                 38
   continuing tension at the border, associated overall decline in the economic performance of
   Eritrea, loss of Ethiopian transit traffic in the aftermath of the war, and overall decline in world
   trade volumes due to economic and financial downturn worldwide in 2008 and onwards. Also,
   given that most of the project’s activities in the Port of Massawa were completed by the end of
   2008, with the exception of new oil jetty, our comparison of actual and forecast traffic is
   complicated by the fact that the appraisal traffic targets were only until 2005, four years after the
   expected completion of all activities under the project.

   12.      In general, the actual traffic level handled at Port Massawa has increased only marginally
   from 610,000 tons in 1996 to 680,000 tons in 2007. However, it is important to note that the
   traffic levels followed a positive trend during the 1997-2005 and even peaked to 1.25 million
   tons in 2003. In 2005 the actual traffic levels exceeded the appraisal forecast, which registered
   substantial benefits to the project during this intermediate period, though the global financial
   crisis of 2008-2009 has set the traffic back, bringing it down to 536,000 tons in 2010.

   13.    The following table compares the traffic forecasts for 2005 with actuals for that year and
   the years since then. As mentioned earlier, the period after 2008 is characterized by financial and
   economic crisis and the associated decline in trade volumes worldwide, affecting the port traffic.

   downturn and associated decline in trade worldwide, including Eritrea.


   Estimate of Ex-Post Economic Returns

   14.    Overall, the project financed activities have resulted in increased capacity and expansion
   of Port Massawa through the extension of the container terminal and berths, improvement of
   Massawa causeways, and acquisition of new port equipment and spare parts.

   15.    At appraisal, the investment was evaluated based on standard port appraisal methodology
   and techniques, such as assessment of the implications of port traffic, cargo handling rates and
   berth capacity on berth occupancy, shipping delays and user costs. The economic benefits were
   derived from reduction in berthing time delay, reduction in wait time for ship to berth, and
   increase in flow of containers. Benefits were estimated for years 1999 to 2005.

   16.     Due to lack of detailed updated data to re-estimate the benefits and no availability of
   port’s actual financial data on operating and maintenance costs and revenues, we rely on the
   estimations made at appraisal to estimate the benefits per ton and adjust them to the actual traffic

                                                           39
volumes and productivity levels. The operating and maintenance costs are also assumed as at
appraisal. Benefits for the years after 2005 are assumed at the same benefit/ton level as 2005.
Traffic data unavailable for years 2008 and 2009 is assumed at the same level as in 2010 (the
lowest traffic in the trend) to be more conservative.

17.     On this basis, the ex post economic return for Massawa Port investment (excluding the
new oil jetty) is now at about 42 percent with NPV of US$ 29 million (at 12 percent), which is
only slightly lower than the appraisal estimate of 45% without the new oil jetty. The difference
is barely significant, given continuing uncertainties, but the result is far in excess of the cost of
capital and very robust. Even if the annual benefits from 2006 until the end of the period were to
be third of what was expected and the operating costs were double of the forecast, the final EIRR
would decrease to as low as 35%, which still is significantly justified.

                     Note on a Site Visit to Port of Massawa (June 14, 2012)


Report on the visit to the Port of Massawa

       On June 14, 2012, the mission, accompanied by the Project Coordinator in Eritrea, visited
the Port of Massawa. Unfortunately on the day of the visit there were no ships at berth being
loaded or unloaded, so the mission could not observe the cargo handling operations.

        The overall impression of the port is quite positive on the basis of the following aspects:
•   The port area is quite spacious, certainly when considering that the 2010 throughput was in
    the order of 1 million tons, including approximately 20,000 TEU containerized cargo.
•   The Port has 6 berths all equipped with a sufficient number of bollards and fenders made out
    of used tyres.
•   The apron area as well as the container stacking area are paved with interlocking concrete
    blocks and make a very good impression; broken blocks could not be spotted and the
    subsidence that was spotted in a few places was minimal. In particular at berth 6 the apron
    width is very good; in the order of some 40 meters.
•   The container stacking area provides a good and organized impression; container location
    identifications are painted in the terminal, the terminal area has a good run-off slope and
    drainage system, sufficient lighting towers for night work, and the rows of containers are
    nicely lined, whereas the average stacking height was in the order if about 2.5.
•   There was enough space available for the stacking of many more containers. i.e. the
    Occupation Rate is quite low.
•   The operational area where containers are loaded and unloaded to and from trucks, by means
    of reachstackers, is spacious. At the time of the visit three reachstackers were in the location.
•   The terminal also includes a so-called consolidation shed, where stripping and stuffing of
    containers takes place.
•   A somewhat negative point could be made with respect to security. As a consequence to
    increase safety and security, all ports should apply the principles of ISPS (International Ship
    and Port Security) Code of the IMO which implies that all persons and goods that enter a port
    or terminal should be checked and/or identified. When the mission entered the port the
    security inspection was the very minimum and the security post at the container terminal was
    not even manned. If Eritrea expands its international sea-going trade this is an issue that
    needs to be addressed.
•   The port is equipped with a considerable fleet of equipment, certainly when compared to its
    present throughput.
•   Berths 5 and part of berth 6 can be served by in total three rail mounted quay cranes.


                                                 59
•     The port also has 3 heavy duty mobile cranes. However, according to information received
      from the PCU, the use of these cranes is not very frequent; there are said to be mechanical
      problems, high fuel consumption and the large container spreader is in need of repair. For
      this reason, as most of the containers that have to be loaded and unloaded are carried by
      ‘geared’ vessels, container handling is mostly executed by the ship’s gear, or sometimes by
      one or more of the rail mounted quay cranes.
•     The mission also observed a number of bagging machines.
•     The equipment storage and repair yard included more cargo handling equipment such as
      mobile cranes, forklift trucks, a reach stacker and a number of tugmasters. It could not be
      established if this equipment was in working order or waiting for servicing and / or repair.

       It was unfortunate that the mission could not see the port ‘in action’, i.e. could observe
loading and unloading operations, or towing operations. Notwithstanding the extensive port
knowledge and know-how of PCU Coordinator, it is regretted that the mission could not meet
with senior port management staff to discuss issues related to the port layout, -operations,
throughput and a number of operational productivity data.

        But in conclusion, the overall impression is that Massawa has sufficient space to handle
its present throughput and certainly also considerable increases in the future. In terms of civil
engineering and layout (both on the apron and in the container stacking area) the impression is
very positive.
