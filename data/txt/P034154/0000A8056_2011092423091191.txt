                         Implementation Status Overview
                         1. Works on the construction of a new oil jetty are going on, though delayed. This is the only outstanding project activity. However concerns have been raised regarding less than
                         satisfactory performance of the contractor and works are unlikely to be completed by December 31, 2011, the closing date for the IDA credit and EU grant.
                         2. In view of the likely delay in completion of works, the task team wrote to the Government seeking to know whether or not it would request for an extension of the credit and Grant

                         closing dates. The Government has written informing IDA that it has no intention of requesting for an extension of both the IDA credit and EU Grant beyond December 31, 2011.
                         3. The team has been assessing, jointly with the EU, the technical and economic implications to the country if the construction of a new Oil Jetty is not completed. The country will not
                         only lose in terms of its economic value to the country, but also the environmental hazard in case the current oil jetty collapsed.
                         4. At the current rate and given the rather poor performance of the contractor, at least 12 additional months will be required beyond December 31, 2011. However, under the
                         circumstances, the task team is reviewing the construction schedule again to identify what are the critical activities that could be constructed before the project closing.
                         5. The task team is still following up with the Government at a technical level exploring the possibility of fielding a supervision mission. It has not been possible therefore to update the
                         progress towards achieving the set targets.

                         Key Decisions Regarding Implementation
                         1. All activities, except the construction of a new oil jetty (new project activity), of the project including expansion of the Massawa causeways, expansion of the container terminal and
                         procurement of port equipment and various studies have been completed. As a result, the capacity of the port of Massawa has been increased. Construction of the new oil jetty is to
                         replace an existing one which is in poor condition.
                         2. The construction works on the new oil jetty are going on, though delayed. Concerns have been raised regarding the unsatisfactory performance of the contractor. It is unlikely that
                         the works will be completed by December 31, 2011 and extension of time will be required.
                         3. EC is the major financing partner in this case with 53% contribution, and EC will be consulted on any decision on the way forward.
                         4. The Government has expressed its unwillingness to request for an extension of the closing dates for both the IDA credit and EU Grant beyond December 31, 2011, and also
                         supervision of the project by the Bank's team.
                         5. The task team in conjunction with the EU has initiated an assessment of the environmental and economic impact in the absence of any extension and to be able to determine the
                         potential exposure/reputation risks that may arise in the event the construction of the proposed new oil jetty is not completed and/or the old oil jetty collapses, and also chart the way
                         forward.
