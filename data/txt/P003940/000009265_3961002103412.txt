MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
PRIMARY EDUCATION QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit for your approval the following memorandum and
recommendation on a proposed loan to the Republic of Indonesia for US$ 37
million equivalent to help fin&nce a Primary Education Quality Improvement
Project. The proposed loan would be repayable in 20 years including five
years of grace at the Bank's standard variable interest rate.
2.          Background.  Now that Indonesia has achieved universal access to
primary education and enrollment expansion has slowed, the Government's
strategy for the entire education system is to develop the quality of the
human resources to support the country's socio-economic potential. To raise
lower secondary enrollment rates requiires that a higher proportion of well-
prepared primary students (now 50%) graduate from grade 6, able to cope with
lower secondary education. Poor and uneven quality is a major problem at the
base of the education system where 27 million 7-12-year-olds are enrolled in
primary schools. The poor quality is indicated by low student achievement,
high repetition and rising dropout rates and has adverse effects on secondary
and tertiary education, creating shortages of trainable labor and threatening
the country's productive potential. Poor quality is due to several
interconnected factors: (a) .neffective teaching-learning processes by under-
qualified t-eachers, who lack professional development opportunities and good
materials; (b) an inequitable public funding system which penalizes schools in
poor communities because parents cannot make contributions to school funds;
and (c) weak and fragmented management capacity for effective service delivery
and quality improvement.
3.          The Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC) is responsible for
quality standards, but is weak in policy formulation and lacks sound
information base and, being a centralized agency, does not have sufficient
capacity to respond to local needs and cultural diversity. The main problem
for service delivery is that accountability for administrative support to
schools at regional level is divided between the MOEC and the Regional
Administration Education Services Offices (DINAS P&K) under the umbrella of
the Ministry of Home Affairs. DINAS' have administered teachers and funds for
over 40 years under the regional autonomy laws but lack the technical
expertise for effectiveness and efficiency and may not follow MOEC technical
advice. The budgeting process is similarly fragmented and hinders rational
resource allocation. An underlying substantive issue which is contentious and
sensitive is whether regional administrations or the central government agency
(MOEC) should administer primary school budgets and personnel, or whether the
prevailing dual administration should be continued and made more workable.
The Government recognizes that this issue needs to be resolved. A new law,
PP.no.28, 1990, reaffirms the MOEC's authority to set quality standards and
assigns to it a much larger share of responsibility for primary education
administration, including teachers and materials, whilst the regional
administration's sphere of authority would be reduced to land acquisition,
construction and maintenance of facilities. The intention behind the law is



2
to reduce the weaknesses in accountability caused by divided administration
but its implementation is delayed because the Government is currently
conducting multi-sectoral reviews of the autonomy laws and intends to use this
process to smooth out the inconsistencies in the subsector's statutory
framework in order to strengthen administrative support to schools and
teachers. Meanwhile, responsibilities will remain unchanged and "co-
administration' is to be made more effective and efficient tnrough measures
the proposed project would develop.
4.          Strategy and Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The New Education
Policy 1988 and Basic Law No. 2 1989 provide some elements for a subsector
strategy under the Fifth and Sixth Five-Year Plans. Recently introduced
policies have concentrated on addressing the core issue of poor teacher
proficiency. A new pre-service teacher training course has raised the
educational entry level of new recruits into teacher training and a two-year
in-service diploma course has been .-eveloped. A revised curriculum and new
books are being developed for 1994. The most innovative policy, however, is
the dissemination of an ongoing pilot program to provide regular professional
development for teachers (as contrasted with once-off upgrading). This
provides professional support to teachers in replacing chalk-and-talk teaching
and rote learning with active problem-solving approaches to stimulate
scientific learnin6 and creativity. It is now expanded to several provinces
and has fired public enthusiasm. Known as the Teacher Professional Support
System (SPP) and Student Active Learning (CBSA), it has recently been
successfully evaluated and is to be disseminated nationally. Both the new
two-year in-service diploma course and the SPP/CBSA programs are to provide
inputs to a performance-based credit point system and "functional" career path
for teachers by which they can earn faster promotions. This was recently
introduced by the State Ministry for Utilization of Government Apparatus
together with the MOEC. These innovations now need evaluation of their
effectiveness, efficiency and affordability. Although these policies
correctly identify and address the core issue of teacher quality, the
Government does not yet have a fully comprehensive subsector strategy to
address other issues affecting quality, such as poverty and weak management.
The Bank presence would support the development of a comprehensive strategy
through the vehicle of an Action Plan for Primary Education Policy and Program
Development, which would provide for school resource needs assessment,
enhancement of teachers' promotion opportunities, integrated and consolidated
budgets, provision of Special Assistance to under-served schools and
development of guidelines on integrated primary education expenditure plans.
5.          Project Objective and Description.  The overall objective of the
project is to introduce policies and mechanisms to improve primary education
quality aime at raising student achievement and completion rates. The
objective would be achieved by provision of technical assistance, training,
equipment and operational support for: (a) improving Teaching-Learning
Processes; (b) providing a more equitable resource base for under-served
schools; and (c) enhancing capacity to manage quality improvement programs.
Component (a) would provide support to six provinces, Aceh, Bali, East Nusa
Tenggara (NTT), North Sulawesi, West Sumatra and Yogjakarta, that intend to
expand and develop SPP/CBSA. This component would also develop policy and
capacity to provide more and better quality books and materials and test the
feasibility of the credit point and functional systems for teachers.
Component (b) would help upgrade the quality of "under-served" schools by
providirg them with compensatory Special Assistance Funds (SAFs) and training
school principals in resource management.  The Government has adopted the
principle of village poverty as the criterion for targeting these schools and



3
intends to deliver special assistance funds directly to school principals via
local banks or treasuries. This component would be piloted initially in NTT
and West Sumatra. Then, if proven successful, it would be expanded to the
other four SPP/CBSA provinces and, finally, in up to six of the poolest
provinces. Component (c) would have regional and national elements. In two
provinces only, NTT and West Sumatra, the project would introduce measures to
rationalize the respective responsibilities of the MOEC and DINAS P&K in
providing administrative support to primary schools. It would help improve
financial planning and budgeting by consolidating budgetary information at
school, regional and national level. It would also promote MOEC institutional
capacity to formulate policy, set and monitor quality standards and provide
information to the public on quality improvement.
6.          The project would break new ground in several ways.  It would
focus exclusively on quality and software and not on facilities. It would
improve quality by an in-depth rather than widespread approach, implementing
SPP/CBSA in only six provinces and would concentrate on a number of innovative
activities in two provinces only. The targeting of schools in poor villages
is a major innovation in the sector and moves away from a concept of general
equity whereby all are treated the same, to one where public funds are
allocated differentially according to need. The project also supports poverty
alleviation by the targeting strategy and contributes to WID objectives since
half of the primary teaching force is female. The project would realistically
be only a first step in quality improvement, which, as the world-wide
experience has shown, is long and difficult to achieve. It would address a
limited number of issues, leaving others to a planned series of follow-up
projects, including a proposed Primary Teacher Development Project, which is
expected to be presented to the Executive Directors shortly.
7.          Project Implementation and Sustainability.  The MOEC would be the
project implementing agency but staff of related agencies would also
participate in project management and training, thus promoting inter-agency
co-administration and budgetary coordination. At the center, an Inter-agency
Steering Committee has been established and a Technical Advisory Board would
provide inter-agency guidance on implementation. The MOEC would be
responsible for project execution through a Central Project Management Unit
(CPMU). In the six SPP/CBSA provinces, the project management structure at
provincial and district levels would mirror that at central level. To support
implementation there would be a substantial technical assistance and
fellowship program. Institutional sustainability would be promoted by
integrating the central project management arrangements into the existing MOEC
Directorate of Primary Education and by building on existing institutions
rather than creating new ones. Provision of ongoing budgetary support to
sustain these programs at current levels is not likely to be a problem for the
Government as it constitutes less than 1% of the national budget. Assuming a
GNP and primary education budget annual growth rate of 6 - 7%, the real cost
of sustainability would decline relative to the primary education budget.
8.          Lessons Learned from Past Projects.   The project's content and
design draw from lessons comprehensively highlighted in the recent OED Report,
An Assessment of Two Decades of Lending, (Report no.9752) and the Basic
Education Study (Report no.7481).  Because of its long country experience in
the education sector, its worldwide access to the findings of research on
basic education, poverty alleviation and service delivery, the Bank's
assistance will help the Government improve primary education quality
nationally.

9.          Actions Agreed.  The Government has agreed that it would:  (a)
carry out the project in accordance with an Action Plan for Primary Education
Policy and Program Development, satisfactory to the Bank; (b) by October 1,
1992, appoint SPP/CBSA tutors in SPP/CBSA provinces; (c) (i) by June 30, 1993,
identify and select under-served schools from among its primary schools in
accordance with criteria, procedures and data base(s) satisfactory to the
Bank; (ii) establish the Special Assistance Funds in accordance with the
recommendations of the study referred to in the Action Plan; (iii) adopt and
put into effect policies and guidelines satisfactory to the Bank, to maintain
and operate the special assistance funds; and (d) train principals of under-
served schools in accordance with a training plan and by April 1 of each year,
commencing in 1993, furnish to the Bank an annual training plan for priticipals
of these schools, both satisfactory to the Barnk. The Government would take
the following actions as conditions of effectiveness: (a) establishment of a
Central Project Management Unit (CPMU), (b) appoint.ment of a Project Director
as head of the CPMU, (c) establishment of Provincial Project Management Units
(PPMU) in each of the six SPP/CBSA provinces and (d) appointment of a Project
Manager as head of each PPI4U. As conditions of disbursement of Special
Assistance Funds, the Government would: (a) provide evidence to the Bank that
the under-served school principals have been trained, and (b) establish and
put into effect policies and guidelines to operate and maintain SAFs in
accordance with recommendations of the study incorporated in the Action Plan.
10.         Benefits and Risks.  The immediate beneficiaries would be over
30,000 teachers and their students whose learning achievement potential would
be enhanced. Children of the poor and female teachers would also benefit.
The main risk would be that the challenging administrative and budgetary
policy reforms agreed will be delayed in practice, thus reducing the project's
sustainability and effectiveness. This risk will be mitigated by the adoption
of the covenanted Action Plan and a mid-term implementation review. Previous
experience indicates that training and service delivery planned centrally may
not be implemented effectively locally. This risk is minimized by providing
project-specific and local training in planning, management and implementation
and by suiporting MOEC institutional development. A risk inherent in quality
improvement is that positive effects may not be demonstrable in the short
term, thus weakening the reform impetus. This would be addressed by an
emphasis on monitoring progress and outcomes and by fostering public support
by disseminating information on the project's goals.
11.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the loan.
