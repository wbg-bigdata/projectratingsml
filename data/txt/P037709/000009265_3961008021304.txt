MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO THE
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF HONDURAS
FOR A THIRD SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a
proposed development credit to the Republic of Honduras for SDR 19.1 million (US$30.0 million
equivalent) to help finance a Third Social Investment Fund Project. The credit would be
repayable on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40 years, including a 10 year grace period.
The project would also be assisted by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and the
Government of the Federal Republic of Germany (German Credit Institute for Reconstruction,
KfW), through parallel financing in the amounts of US$40 million and DM15.0 million (US$10.0
million equivalent), respectively. The Honduran Social Investment Fund (FHIS), the State
Secretariat of Planning (SECPLAN), and the State Secretariat of Environment (SEDA) would be
the implementing agencies for the project.
2.    Background. Although Honduras has experienced some economic progress over the last
two decades, per capita GNP in 1994 remains low at an estimated US$580. One-third of the
population of 5.5 million lives in extreme poverty, and 80 percent of the poor live in rural areas.
The promising economic trends of 1991-92 were not sustained in 1993. As the elections
approached, the fiscal deficit, which was targeted to fall to 3.8 percent of GDP in 1993, reached
over 10 percent. A new Administration took office in January 1994, inheriting serious fiscal and
balance of payments problems. Inflationary pressure began to build up in 1993, and foreign
exchange reserves have now been depleted. The present Administration is committed to the
resumption of sustainable economic growth, through the implementation of a medium-term
program that aims to reduce the fiscal deficit, reform the public sector to ensure more efficient use
of public resources, and raise significantly the level of human capital accumulation through
improved quality and equity in the provision of social services.
3.    The conclusions of a joint Bank-IDB Public Investment Review mission in
November/December 1994 confirm that substantial social expenditures will continue to be
required to help improve the country's poor social indicators. These include an illiteracy rate for
the adult population of 32 percent (reaching over 42 percent in rural areas), a total fertility rate of
4.5 per woman of child bearing age, a maternal mortality rate of 221 per 100,000 live births, an
infant mortality rate of 45 per 1,000 live births, and malnutrition affecting 46 percent of children
under five.
4.    Although Honduras has made considerable progress in improving education in recent
decades, particularly at the primary school level, it still experiences major problems related to
quality, efficiency, and equity, including overcrowded and dilapidated physical facilities and
lirnited school access. More than one-third of the rural primary schools are incomplete, i.e., they
cover only the first three or four grades of instruction. As a result, there are still 70,000 children
with no access to full primary education, predominantly in rural areas of extreme poverty and



2
geographic isolation. According to recent data from the Ministry of Education (MOE), there is a
need, over the next four years, for about 3,200 additional classrooms, as well as for the repair and
rehabilitation of about 11,800 existing classrooms, meaning a total investment of about US$61
million, excluding necessary furniture.
5.    Health and nutrition indicators also reflect the acute problems still facing the poor:
inadequate diets, lack of sanitation, deficient coverage of the primary health care system, and
ignorance about hygiene, correct nutritional practices, and preventive health care. Infant and
maternal mortality are much higher in rural than in urban areas, and are subject to wide regional
variations. For example, in the three poorest regions of the country, maternal mortality is
estimated at above 340 per 100,000. Nutritional deficiencies are a contributing factor in about 60
percent of infant deaths. By the time they enter primary school, the growth of 3 5 percent of
children is stunted. Undernutrition is also a major health problem of pregnant and nursing
women: over half the women attending health centers suffered from mild or moderate anemia and
vitamin A deficiency. According to recent data from the Ministry of Health (MOH), primary
health care still does not reach about 20 percent of the population. This would require, inter alia,
an investment in new health centers, as well as in repairing and rehabilitating existing centers, of
about US$3 million. This amount excludes furniture and supplies.
6.    The provision of water and basic sanitation is highly inefficient and biased in favor of
urban areas. Although about 70 percent of the population -- 90 percent of the population in urban
areas and 54 percent in rural areas -- has access to a water supply system, treatment is deficient,
and only 17 percent of the population has safe water. In addition, those who have no access,
mainly the poor, pay up to 77 times as much for water as those who have access. To correct this
inequity, and to provide access to an additional 300,000 families in rural areas alone, would cost
at least US$27 million. In addition, there is a need for major investment in basic sanitation.
Sewerage covers only 25 percent of the population, concentrated in urban areas. Waste removal
in most of the country, covering about 37 percent of the population, is handled through latrines.
For latrines alone, there is a need for more than 50,000 new ones and replacements yearly,
estimated to cost at least US$25 million over a four-year period.
7.    Government Strategy. The Government has a clear understanding of social needs, and is
assigning high priority to overcoming its education and health problems. However, although
Government spending in education and health amounted to about 7 percent of GDP,
corresponding to about one-third of central government spending over the period 1985-92,
inefficiency and inequity of spending have been ongoing problems. The Government is making an
effort to strengthen the project planning and implementation capacity of the responsible ministries
and agencies, but, in the meantime, considers its social safety net programs of critical importance.
FIlS and the Family Assistance Program (PRAF) were both established in 1990, and targeted at
the poorest and most vulnerable groups: FIlS to generate emergency employment and to build
and rehabilitate small-scale infrastructure quickly and efficiently, and PRAF to provide food
coupons to poor, pregnant, and nursing women, children under five, and primary school children
in departments with the highest malnutrition rates. Both programs have been quite successful, as
also confirmed in the OED Performance Audit Report (No. 13839 of December 30, 1994) on the
IDA credits supporting FHIS and PRAF (Cr. 2212-HO of 1991 and Cr. 2401-HO of 1992). Until



3
the line ministries have overcome ongoing weaknesses in procurement, disbursement, civil service
systems, and planning and budgeting, the Government wishes FHIS to continue to complement
the ministries' activities. FHIS will have the authority to manage the implementation of small-
and medium-scale subprojects, while the ministries will focus on policy and norm setting, as well
as operation and maintenance responsibilities. The Government has now asked that various
donors, including IDA, IDB, and KfW, continue to assist FMIS in addressing poverty alleviation
through priority subprojects at the municipal and community levels.
8.    Rationale for IDA Involvement. Continued assistance to FHIS is consistent with
theBank Group's country assistance strategy for Honduras, which aims at reducing poverty,
modernizing the economy and the public sector, and prudently managing the country's natural
resources, and which was discussed by the Executive Directors in August 1993, in conjunction
with the presentation of the Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (P-5923-HO of July 14, 1993).
The OED Performance Audit Report confirmed that FHIS has succeeded in producing a large
number of small, widely-dispersed subprojects targeted to the poor. Further IDA and IDB
involvement would be critical to help the Government mobilize additional resources for poverty
alleviation to accompany its economic reform program. FHIS would serve as a powerful
mechanism to help mobilize and coordinate donor assistance for the social sectors. Equally
important, the Country Economic Memorandum/Poverty Assessment (No. 13317 of November
17, 1994) stated that FHUS has had a significantly positive impact on the development of small-
scale infrastructure, as well as upon improving the implementation capacity of small private
construction firms, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and municipalities, strengthening
their institutional capacity, and laying the groundwork for decentralization. The proposed project
would complement other efforts supported by IDA, including the ongoing Nutrition and Health
(Cr. 2452-HO), Environmental Development (Cr. 2693-HO), and Basic Education (Cr. 2694-HO)
projects, as well as the proposed Public Sector Modernization Project, scheduled for discussion
by the Executive Directors in mid-1995. All these projects are to contribute to capacity
strengthening of the social sector ministries.
9.    Project Objectives. The proposed project would continue to assist the Government in
strengthening its poverty alleviation efforts and in maintaining social cohesion, while the
Government attempts to regain fiscal balance and the line ministries strengthen their institutional
capacities. It would also support the Government's decentralization strategy and development of
the local contracting industry. To achieve this, it would focus on meeting priority social
infrastructure and basic needs, decided in close consultation with relevant government
departments, municipalities, NGOs, and communities, within the municipal allocations decided on
the basis of a poverty targeting formula.
10.   Project Description. The project would support FHIS' investment program for a four-
year period, as well as efforts to establish a better social data base and to assist municipalities on
environmental matters, It would have the following investment, technical assistance, and
subproject management components:
(a)   Infrastructure Subprojects (US$95 million or 84 percent of total subproject costs).
Subprojects sponsored by municipalities, community organizations, and NGOs,



4
dealing with (i) rehabilitation, maintenance, and expansion of preprimary, primary,
and junior secondary schools, health centers and posts, and small water and
sewerage facilities, as well as maintenance of rural roads; (ii) construction and
repair of drainage and irrigation canals and ditches, public markets and other public
facilities, and construction of bridges, gutters, and sidewalks; (iii) rehabilitation of
archeological and historical sites aimed at preserving cultural heritage, as well as
programs focused on ethnic minorities; and (iv) subject to the outcome of the pilot
subprojects carried out under the Environmental Development Project in 20
municipalities over the next 18-24 months, small-scale environmental investments,
such as urban and community parks, solid and liquid waste management,
protection of water sources, soil protection and erosion control, biodiversity, and
energy generation and conservation. These subprojects would be executed by
private contractors, NGOs, municipalities, and public sector agencies.
(b)   Basic Needs Programs (US$5 million or 4 percent of total project costs).
Programs dealing with nutrition, training of midwives and other health workers,
childcare and early development programs, care for the elderly and disabled,
teaching materials, and community development for ethnic minorities. The
programs would address priority social needs, identified and designed in
consultation with MOE and MOH, and would be executed by NGOs and private
and public sector agencies.
(c)   Institutional Strengthening of FHlS (US$0.8 million or 1 percent of total project
costs). This component would include: (i) 16 months of technical assistance to
help strengthen FHIS' policies and practices for management of the subproject
cycle/production line (planning, identifying, appraising, contracting, supervising,
and evaluating subprojects); this would include, inter alia, analysis and
recommendations on organizational structure, manuals, staffing, and training
requirements; (ii) training programs for FIUS' management and staff; (iii) four
months of technical assistance to help improve FHIS' systems for recruitment,
training, evaluation, and remuneration of personnel; (iv) six months of technical
assistance to help improve the MIS system; (v) two months of technical assistance
to help strengthen FHIS' basic needs program; (vi) two months of technical
assistance to help promote community participation in all stages of the subproject
cycle; (vii) a promotional training program to make US Peace Corps volunteers
and their Honduran counterparts aware of how to access FHIS funding for priority
community development subprojects; (viii) six months of technical assistance to
improve FIUS' accounting and internal auditing practices; (ix) six months of
technical assistance for analysis of financing mechanisms for maintenance of
subprojects; (x) 12 months of technical assistance to help improve Fl-HS' water
supply and sanitation policies and practices; and (xi) workshops and materials
organized by the Program of Support to the Informal Sector (PASI) to assist its
micro-enterprise program in general and female entrepreneurs in particular.



5
(d)   Social Data Collection and Analysis (US$0. 1 million or 0.1 percent of total project
costs). Because Honduras has no single information tool with which to assess
overall deficiencies in meeting social sector needs, this component would assist
with creating a social data mapping system and improving the current household
survey sample, questionnaire, and execution used by the Directorate-General of
Statistics and Census and private firms. With input from the line ministries,
coordinated through SECPLAN, the mapping system would allow FHIS and the
responsible line ministries to better assess priority needs in given communities, and
to evaluate progress over time. The component would also provide for the
analysis of FHIIS' coverage in the social sectors. In addition, to obtain more useful
data on poverty and social indicators, there is a need to update and improve the
household survey practices. A small program of technical assistance, managed
through SECPLAN, would be provided under the project.
(e)   Environmental Assistance to Municipalities (US$0.9 million or 1 percent of total
project costs). Subject to the outcome of the technical assistance to municipal
environmental management in 20 municipalities under the Environmental
Development Project, the proposed project would include an environmental
awareness and training program for municipalities not covered under the earlier
assistance. This component should help the municipalities to better manage their
natural resources and to address their environmental problems, as well as to
increase public participation in the solution of the environmental problems of the
communities. It would be managed by SEDA, in close cooperation with FHIS.
(f)   Project Management (US$10.8 million or 10 percent of total project costs).
Project administration during the four-year implementation period is expected to
cost the equivalent of US$9.5 million. Other subcomponents would be the
procurement of some vehicles and equipment and the services of an external
auditor.
11.   Project Implementation. The proposed project would be implemented nation-wide over
a four-year period. FIBS would be the principal implementing agency, but SEDA would take the
lead in implementing the environmental technical assistance to the municipalities. In addition,
SECPLAN would coordinate the social data collection and analysis technical assistance, in close
cooperation with FHIS. Subprojects in infrastructure and basic needs could be proposed by
central government agencies, municipalities, community groups, and NGOs, and would be
executed by private contractors, including NGOs.
12.   Although FLIS' annual budget for subprojects would be allocated to the municipalities on
the basis of a poverty formula (see para. 19), the actual allocations to the municipalities would
depend upon the subproject proposals originating from those municipalities. To assist the poorer
municipalities with limited subproject design capacity, FHIS would strengthen its promotion
activities. Retroactive financing is expected in an amount of up to US$3.0 million (10 percent of
the credit amount) for eligible subproject expenditures incurred as of January 1, 1995. A
breakdown of estimated costs and financing is shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of



6
procurement and disbursement and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A time
table of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Honduras are
given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 14181-HO, dated June
16, 1995, is also attached.
13.   Project Sustainability. If FHIS were to address the needs, over the period 1995-99, for
construction/reconstruction of about 2,900 classrooms, rehabilitation/repair of about 1 1,800
classrooms, 2,600 school bathrooms, and 6,300 school latrines, as well as some minor work on
health centers, this would mean incremental operation and maintenance expenditures of about
US$3.0 million annually after project completion. Furthermore, additional teachers for new
classrooms would require about US$4.5 million annually after project completion. Following the
completion of education and health subprojects, MOE and MOH, respectively, would be
responsible for operation and maintenance costs. In the context of the Government's
decentralization drive, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) is considering a plan that the municipalities
bear at least part of the maintenance costs. Financing arrangements among the various actors will
be exarnined under the technical assistance component, and the Government will submit a
proposal by March 31, 1996. Teacher salaries would remain the responsibility of MOE, and this
would be reflected in the new agreement between FHIS and MOE. Even assuming that the
municipalities and ultimate beneficiaries would not contribute and that all of the above costs
would have to be borne by MOE, the impact of these costs on the MOE budget would be only 0.2
percent in 1996, 0.8 percent in 1997, 1.7 percent in 1998, 2.4 percent in 1999, and 2.7 percent in
2000, thus remaining manageable. Because there would be no new health centers, incremental
recurrent costs for health centers would be negligible. The cost of operation and maintenance of
water and sanitation subprojects would be borne by the beneficiaries, which reconfirms the
importance of establishing a water user board at the time of subproject identification. T he early
establishment of "ownership" is of critical importance in ensuring beneficiary contributions and,
thus, sustainability. Further guidance is also expected from a Sustainability Pilot Project,
managed by UNICEF and funded by KfW, the results of which should be available in late- 1995 /
early- 1 996.
14.   Lessons Learned. The design of the proposed project has taken into account the lessons
learned from the first two Social Investment Fund Projects in Honduras and from social
investment funds in other countries. First, freedom from normal government salary, personnel
recruiting, budgeting, procurement, and disbursement restrictions have promoted efficiency.
FHIS has been able to hire quality professional personnel, who have been able to carry out FHIS'
program efficiently. Under the proposed project, FHFIS would continue to be exempt from normal
government restrictions. Second, well-defined and transparent targeting and allocation of
resources reduce political interference risks, and help ensure that high social return subprojects
are directed at the poor. The proposed project would provide for the updating of poverty
mapping and the allocation of project r esources based on poverty level. Social sector data would
be generated through the proposed project's support for social data mapping and the national
household survey. Third, a standardized menu of subprojects promotes efficiency by limiting the
range of specialists to be recruited, providing standard parameters and specifications used by
sponsors in subproject preparation, and facilitating subproject appraisal and supervision. The
basic needs program menu would be streamlined, and although environmental subprojects would



,IIIIVLIL tLUj, L1tJ 1J3v.dL jJ_vs YV   ._ _.
7
probably be added to FHIS' menu of subprojects, the number would be kept small enough to
ensure that FHLS' operations remain well-focused. Fourth, oversight by external donors has
promoted efficiency and limited political risks by requiring quarterly and annual audits, the
maintenance of internal auditing and control systems, semi-annual progress reporting, mid-term
reviews, and donor project supervision. These requirements would be continued under the
proposed project, and strengthened through the introduction of annual project and work program
reviews with the relevant government agencies, FHIS, and donor representatives. Fifth, there is a
need for continued updating and upgrading of the MIS, as well as to ensure that the monitoring
and evaluation system is based on an appropriate set of performance and impact criteria of real
use to FHIS' management and the donors. And sixth, coordination with social sector ministries
has been essential for the effective delivery of social services to beneficiaries, and has recently
been strengthened by adding the Ministers of Education and Health to FHIS' Board. In addition,
FHIS would sign new letters of agreement on subproject implementation and maintenance with
the relevant ministries as well as municipalities.
15.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations, the following matters were discussed and agreed
upon:
(a)   Counterpart funds. The Government would provide funds as indicated in the
project financing plan.
(b)   Cofinancing. The Government would ensure parallel funding from IDB, KfW, and
other donors in the amounts of US$40 million, DM15 million, and US$ 15.6
million respectively, by no later than March 31, 1996, or obtain alternative funding.
(c)   Targeting. FIRS would apply the revised poverty targeting formula, as agreed
with IDA, for allocating its 1996 and future resources to the municipalities.
(d)   Changes in FHIS' management. FHIS would not appoint selected senior managers
without prior IDA consultation.
(e)   Annual and mid-term project review. FIRS would organize annual project reviews
with the relevant government agencies and donor representatives to assess the past
year's performance and the next year's proposed work program. Similarly, a mid-
term review would be organized in November 1997 with the same representatives.
(f)    Key performance indicators. FHIS would use a set of agreed indicators for
monitoring project performance, although these would be subject to review by the
consultants to be recruited under the project: (i) to help improve the management
of the subproject cycle, including the monitoring and evaluation system, and (ii) to
work on the MIS system.
(g)   Financing of Maintenance. On the basis of the recommendations to be produced
by the study on the financing of subproject maintenance, the Government would
provide proposals on the improved funding of incremental recurrent expenditures



8
by the line ministries, municipalities and beneficiaries, by no later than March 31,
1996.
16.   Conditions of Effectiveness. As conditions of credit effectiveness, the Borrower would
present evidence that (a) a subsidiary agreement for making the funds available by the Borrower
to FHIS, as well as describing the new arrangements between FHIS, MOE, MOH, and the
municipalities, had been entered into; and (b) the Operational Manuals had been revised as agreed
with IDA, also reflecting the revised environmental review mechanism.
17.   Conditions of Disbursement. As conditions of credit disbursement against (a) the
environmental technical assistance and (b) environmental subprojects, the Borrower would
present evidence that, respectively, (i) corresponding technical assistance provided under the
Environmental Development Project was being implemented satisfactorily and detailed terms of
reference were available and (ii) the pilot environmental subprojects funded under the
Environmental Development Project were progressing well. No disbursements would be made
against food expenditures.
18.   Environmental Aspects. The project would have no significant environmental risks. But
a General Environmental Law was enacted in 1993 which changed the legal, institutional, and
operational framework for environmental management. The body of laws and regulations is still
far from consistent or properly harmonized, but this is being pursued under the Environmental
Development Project. That project is also assisting FHIS in revising its environmental review
mechanism, in line with the new law and regulations, for the pilot environmental subprojects.
FHIS will use the same screening mechanism for all infrastructure subprojects funded under the
project, and reflect it in its Operational Manuals. Additional technical assistance to ensure
compliance with environmental norms in FHIS subprojects is being funded as part of the
Environmental Development Project. If this project proves successful, FHIS would also get
involved in environmental promotion activities. The project has been given an environmental
rating of category "B."
19.   Program Objectives and Poverty Category. The proposed project in the poverty
reduction category is a program of targeted interventions. Resources are allocated to subprojects
by geographic and sector targets. Geographic targets are set by utilizing a poverty index that
adjusts per capita FHIS funding allocations to the municipalities by the level of their poverty
(currently measured by malnutrition and access to water and sanitation, but as of 1996, also
including illiteracy). Virtually all resources are targeted at basic education, basic health, and,
increasingly, small-scale water supply and sanitation, and have thus a built-in bias in favor of the
poorer population groups, which are not yet adequately served.
20.   Participatory Approach. The success of any project of this nature hinges upon
community participation at all stages of the subproject cycle. FHIS has now embarked on a range
of promotional activities to get the beneficiaries involved as of the subproject identification stage.
The project would provide technical assistance to improve and accelerate these efforts.



9
21.   Project Benefits. The project would help reduce poverty through improved access to
basic infrastructure and social services in poor areas and for poor communities. It would help the
Government complete the rehabilitation of long-neglected social and economic infrastructure,
improve the social and economic conditions of women and indigenous groups, and address
environmental concerns, as well as provide employment generation during the economic
adjustment period. Establishment of proper social data mapping and improved implementation of
the household survey and analysis would allow for better investment planning and poverty
targeting and, thus, assist the Government in obtaining a more equitable social expenditure
program.
22.   Project Risks. A substantial risk would be possible political interference in FHIS'
decision-making process and a weakening of its management and staff. However, the
Government has confirmed its commitment to continuing with an independent and strong FHIS,
complementing the activities of the social line ministries. This has been followed by a
strengthened management team and the continued implementation of agreed subproject
processing procedures. There is also a risk that, as a maturing organization, FHIS may lose its
energy, efficiency, and desire to explore new venues. This risk would be mitigated through the
selection of dynamic management and motivated staff with a clear work program. However, an
effective FlITS also requires continuous monitoring and evaluation of project inputs and outputs
to ensure that it maximizes its contribution to the country's poverty alleviation efforts. This
would be achieved through improved information, the proposed social data mapping, and annual
investment program revisions with FHIS, relevant government agencies, and major donor
agencies.
23.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
