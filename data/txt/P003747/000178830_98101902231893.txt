INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A FIVE CITIES WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of USh14.5 million
to help finance a five cities water supply project. The loan would have
a term of 30 years, including six years of grace with interest at 8 percent
per annum. About US$12.3 million of the proposed loan would be relent by the
government to five mnmicipal water enterprises included in the project at an
interest rate of 9 percent per annw  repayable over 30 years including a grace
period of six years,during which the interest would be waived.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        The latest economic report on Indonesia "iThe Indonesian Economy:
Recent Developments and Prospects for 1974/75s,tof November 26, 1973, (R73-273)
described and analyzed the substantial changes which had taken place in the
Indonesian economy in 1973. Since then there have been important further
developments, especially in oil prices. A Basic Economic Mission is planned
for October 1974 to reassess Indonesiats longer term development prospects
and policies. Country data are shown in Annex I.
3.        The Indonesian economy, which was dualistic and export-oriented
in the colonial period, was severely affected by the great depression in
the 'thirties, and the war, followed by the struggle for independence, in
the 'forties. After a relatively brief period of recovery in the early
'fifties, the economy stagnated again in the decade 1957-1967 largely as
a result of adverse economic policies. Thus, after a long period of
economic difficulties, in which the population nearly doubled, Indonesia
had become one of the poorest large countries in the world.
4.        After the Suharto Government introduced an effective stabiliza-
tion program to combat the economic disruption and spiralling inflation of
the mid-1960's, there has been a period of recovery and rehabilitation
under the First Five-Year Plan. Real annual economic growth was close to
7 percent in the period 1968-1972. Domestic savings and investments
increased considerably, thus providing the basis for continued economic
expansion after the rehabilitation phase. By 1972, investments, excluding
those in the oil sector, had grown to an estimated 17 percent of the GNP,
of which more than two-thirds were financed from domestic sources. Sus-
tained efforts were made to increase food production, with emphasis on
rice. Although a drought in the second half of 1972 led to a setback in
food production and a steep increase in prices, production has recovered
since then.  Efforts to expand food production continue to receive high
priority and in this connection, international supplies permitting, the
Government is increasing fertilizer imports in 1974. Expansion of
domestic fertilizer capacity is being pursued actively.
5.        Even before the increase in petroleum prices in the latter
part of 1973, the money economy was booming, and real growth was
probably accelerating under the influence of steep increases in Indonesia's



- 2 -
export prices, a significant physical expansion of production in the oil
and forestry sectors, a rapid growth in direct foreign investment
(initially in m. ning, but increasingly in manufacturing), and a large
inflow of short-term credit. The same factors, however, also caused
significant inflation, reaching a rate of nearly 50 percent during the fiscal
year 1973/749 .'The Government took a number of measures to combat the
inflation, most recently in April, 1974. Since then, the annual rate of
inflation has bee-n 17 percent.
6.         The contribution of the oil sector to the economy, which was
already increasing rapidly, has taken a quantum jump since September 1973.
Ute L.,___esian oil price, which was still $3.73 per barrel in that month,
reached $12.60 per barrel in July, 1974. In addition, early this year,
Indonesia renegotiated the contracts with the foreign oil companies to
receive a larger share of the total oil pmceeds. Thus, while the net oil
contributions to the balance of paynts and the Government's revenues
were below $0.5 billion in 1972/73   (less than 5 percent of the GNP),
they are expected to reach well over $3 billion in 1974/75, an increase of
$20 per capita. Given also the external and domestic inflation, both
exports and budgetary receipts will probably exceed $5 billion in
1974/75, a rough quadrupling in two years.
7.         The inflation is, however, also affecting the expenditure side
of the balance of payments and the budget. Average Indonesian import
prices are expected to increase by 80 percent between 1972 and 1974, with
the largest increases occuring in foodstuffs and agricultural inputs
(rice, wheat, sugar, fertilizer). To shield the domestic consumer against
the effect of high external prices, the Government is subsidizing these
imports at an annual cost of nearly $1 billion. In addition, the Govern-
ment has to pay more for domestic goods and services (including Government
salaries). Thus, about one-half of the additional budgetary receipts will
be eroded by the different effects of inflation0 Of the other half, a
significant part will be spent on real increases in Government outlays,
including much-needed gradual salary increases, development expenditures,
routine material expenditures, and subsidies to regions. Nevertheless,
there will probably remain a budgetary surplus of $0.5 - $1.0 billion in
1974-75. The expected overall suxplus on the balance of payments is
larger, and foreign exchange reserves may increase from $0.9 billion on
March 31, 1974 to about $2.5 billion (about six months of imports at the
then expected rate) a year later.
8.         These surpluses are not large in relation to Indonesia's needs
for additional current and capital expenditures in nearly every field, as
specified in the Second Five Year Flan (1974/75-1978/79). Moreover,
earlier problems of absorbtive capacity are being overcome gzeually.
1/ April 1, 1973 to March 31, 1972a,



Thus, even though some of the expenditures budgeted for 1974/75
(consumers' subsidies) should only be temporary, it will probably not be
long before the new resources are fully absorbed.
9.         The Second Five Year Plan also provides significant new
directions in emphasizing the social, regional and equity aspects of
development, It is recognized that, while the Governmet's initial
economic stabilization and rehabilitation programs, as well as a number
of specific activities, have benefitted large segments of the population,
the benefits of investments in industrv - much of it in or aroiund Jakarta
have not been widely spread. Also, the continued high level of agricultural
prices after the 1972 crop failure has ultimately benefitted the rural areas,
but is severely reducing the real income of the urban poor. The Government's
policy to keep the prices of basic cmmodities in check through subsidization
of imports is providing relief, but it is the intention to gradually work out
and implement a number of more basic socially oriented policies in the fields
of employment, educations housing, etc.
10.        In the short and medium run, Indonesia will need continued
international technical assistance for project implementation and insti-
tution building. After its new financial resources have been absorbed,
Indonesia will also still need financial and technical assistance from
abroad to implement programs to alleviate its poverty. There is
therefore a strong case for continued international assistance to
Indonesia, even though the country may generate relatively modest
budgetary and balance of payments surpluses for a limited period. In
aU probability, these surpluses will have been absorbed by the time
disbursements from new loans become significant.
llo        The soft average terms of foreign assistance provided in the
context of the Inter-Governmental aroup for Indonesia (IGGI), and the re-
scheduling of pre-1966 external debt obligations (under the 1970 Paris
Club Agreemnt with the Western countries and Japan, and parallel arrange-
ments with several Eastern European countriea) have kept Indmnesia's
public debt service ratio relatively low. Service payments on rescheduled
and subsequently incurred public debt are estimated at $344 million in
1974, will reach a peak of $371 million in 1975, and are projected to
decrease gradually thereafter. Comparing these amounts with the projected
export level of over $5 billion in 1974j/75, and given the fact that
Indonesia's external terms of trade will probably remain favorable, it
appears that Indonesia now has the capacity to service significant addi-
tional debt.
12.        The changes in Indonesian economic circumstances discussed
above had become apparent at the time of the IGG pledging meeting in May
1974. As a result, it was generally agreed that progran aid was no longer



as urgently needed as previously, although reduced amowits of such aid can
usefully continue for some time. At the same time, the meeting endorsed
tha view that a considerable expansion in project aid was warranted to
assist Indonesia in carrying out its more ambitious development strategy.
Altlhough some members were not in a position to make pledges, it seems
likely that total aid commitments (including IBRD loans) in 1974/75 wi'll
exceed the aid request of $850 million.
PART II -   BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NINONESIA
13.        As indicated in Part I, Indonesia will continue to need sub-
stantial external financial and technical assistance to rehabilitate and
improve infrastructure and to expand production capabilities in agricul-
ture, minerals, forestry and manufacturing. With the cont-inued growth of
the economy, the Government will also be able to devote increasing atten-
tion to development of effective programs designed to ensure that the
benefita of development are distributed widely. Agricultuiral programs to
increase the productivity of smallholder farmers, regional development
(especially in the outer islands), family planning and other social programs
will therefore have an important place in the development strateQy during
the period of the Second Plan (1975-79).  The work of both lohe headquarters
and Resident Staff has been oriented toward these development objectives.
i,.       The Bank Group has in the past financed some of the local costs
of projects in Indonesia. A limited amount of such financing will continue
to be necessary in connection with Bank Group assistance to the agriculture
and social sectors, wnere projects frequerntly have a low foreigrn exchange
component.
IC.       As of Septembcr 30, 1974, Indonesia has received 37 IDA credits
amounting to Uj3$561.8 amillion and two Bank loans totaling US$73 miillion.
In view of Indonesiats improved circumstances, no further IDA credits axe
planned. The Bank Group accounts for less than L. percent of Indonesia' s
total outstanding public debt. By 1978 i'G is expected to account for less
than '1 percent of total outstanding debt and less than 5 percent of
indo aesia' s annual debt service obli:rations. Annex II contains a suLrnnary
statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC investments as of August 31v
1974, and notes on the execution of on-going projects.
16         in accordance with the priorities of Indonesiafs Yv year
Plans, over 35 percent of lending to date has been for agriculture.  IDA
has extended four credits to help rehabilitate and develop plantations in
the Government estates sector. Other credits for agriculture include four
to assist rehabilitation of irrigation systems and one each for a fisheries
project, a seeds multiplication program, beef cattle development, small-
holder rubber development, sugar industry rehabilitation and smallholder



-5-
tea development. Industry is of growing importance to the Indonesian economy
and the Association has assisted in four projects in this sector. It organized
a consortium of lenders to finance a major expansion of the PUSRI Fertilizer
plant, assisted in the reorganization and financing of the major state development
bank (BAPINDO), provided financial assistance for Indonesia's first industrial
estate project, and assisted in the establishment and financing of the Private
Development Finance Company of Indonesia (PDFCI). Other priority sectors to
which credits have been extended are power, transportation, telecommunications,
education and population. In addition, four credits have been made to assist
the Government in preparing projects and formulating appropriate development
policies.
17.        A loan of US$25 million for an urban development project was approved
on September 17, 197h and projects in rural works, transmigration, agriculture
research, irrigation, inter-island transport and second loans to PUSRI and
BAPINDO are being prepared and should be ready to present to the Executive
Directors during this fiscal year.
18.       The first IDA credit to Indonesia was made in 1968, and about half
of all credits have been made since June 1971. The program has increased
rapidly from a relatively small base, and consequently the undisbursed portion
of IDA credits is relatively large. Disbursements which were at a rate of
less than US$3 million per month in 1972 are now at a rate of about US$6 million
per month and accelerating. Many credits have been associated with institutionaL
reforms involving, inter alia, the creation of new project authorities, drafting
of new charters and the enactment of new legislation, all of which has taken
time. Thus, a number of projects have experienced delays in the initial stages
of implementation. However, project execution has improved sharply during
the last year as organizational improvements have begun to take effect and
Indonesian staff have become more familiar with Bank Group procedures. Never-
theless, several projects continue to suffer from management,procurement and
budgetary problems which will continue to receive close attention from the
Bank's Resident Staff.
PART III - THE SECTOR
Sector Needs and Development
19.       In Indonesia a considerable portion of the total urban population
lives in cities with no public water supply. Where public water supply exists
it is inadequate and serves only a small part of the population. Most people
are dependent on dug wells, streams or rivers with attendant substantial health
risks. Most existing water supply systems suffer from low pressure and inter-
mittent supply, and safe water entering the system does not always remain
uncontaminated.
20.       The water supply needs of the rural population, living in more
than 50,000 villages and comprising about 80% of the total population, pre-
sent a formidable problem. Water is mainly obtained from dug wells, streams
or rivers, which in most cases are contaminated. A very limited program for
organized and safe water supply is assisted by UNICEF/WHO, but it serves
only a negligible percentage of the rural population.



- 6 -
2.        The urban population served by sewerage systems is very small.
Human wastes are. mainly discharged into septic tanks, latrines, surface
drainage ditciies, or directly into streams and rivers, and constitute a
hazarcd for non-public water supplies by polluition of wells, streamru and
rivels.
22.        Between 1959 and 1965 very few water supply schemes were con-
structed in Indonesia. Some have been constructed since 1965. Many of
these improvements will not supply more consumers because the work3 financed
from national funds have been almost exclusively confined to supply and
trai      : .on facilities; municipalities or regencies (administrative units
below provinces) do not have the funds needed to extend distribution systems.
23.        The first Five-Year Plan (1969/70 - 1973/74) provided US$30.2
million and US$0.9 million for urban water supply and sewerage, respectively,
and only US$0.3 million for rural water supply. This level of investment is
insufficient even to maintain the proportion of the population having access
to piped water supplies.   The organization to carry out a massive program
efficiently does not yet exist in the rural areas even if all the funds
were to be provided.
Sector Organization and Management on National and Local Levels
24.       Two ministries are responsible for national water supply and
sewerage planning--the Ministry of Public Works and Power for urban
areas, defined as Municipalities wlth a Dopulation larger than 5,000,
and the Ministry of Health for rural areas.
25.       The Ministry of Health is organized into two units, General and
Sanitary Engineering Division, and Directorate of Hygiene and Sanitation.
Their responsibilities are mainly technical advisory services on water
quality control, design, construction, and related aspects of environmental
sanitation. Within the Ministry of Public Works and Power, the Directorate
General of Water Resources deals mainly with water rights, allocation< of
water resources, and the development of water resources for agricultural
purposes. The Directorate General of Housing, Building, Planningr and Urban
Development (Cipta Karya) is in charge of urban water supply and sewerage.
26.       Cipta Karya through its Directorate of Sanitary Engineering (DSE)
is the implementing agency for water supply and sewerage projects with the
functions of project planning and project selection, fund allocations,
preliminary and detailed engineering, construction supervision and, occasionally,
operation and maintenance of water supply systems.
27.       The municipalities or regencies are responsible for operation and
maintenance of water works and for extension of the distribution systems.
The water works entities are usually a part of the municipal or regency govern-
ment, and their organization and degree of dependency vary from city to city.
In most cases the water revenues barely cover operation and maintenance costs,
and veryfew replacements or extensions of the distribution systems have been
carried out during the last 30 years.



-7-
28.       In the past the Government's contribution to municipalities for
water supply services have been in the form of grants for construction pur-
poses, which were distributed on an ad hoc basis.   Substantial sums were,
however, required to meet ever increesing requirements of the cities through-
out the country. At the request of the Government a Bank Group Mission con-
ducted a sector survey in 1970/71 and the Mission report (PU-81) was published
on December 9, 1971. As a result,master plans and feasibility studies for
seven cities were prepared in 1972-73 by consultants financed by the cecond
Iechnizal Assistance Credit (No. 216-iND). Taking into consideration the
findings of these studies the Government has decided to make a major policy
change and is now increasing allocations and beginning to make loans, with
some equity payments, to selected municipalities under coordinated financing
end technical arrangements.   It also recognizes the need for organizational
changes both at the national and local levels to implement this new policy.
The proposed project is designed to help the Government achieve the objectives
of its new policy and would be used as a model in executing projects financed
by international and bilateral sources.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
29.       The project would be the first stage, covering the years 1975
through 1981, of implementation of master plans for water supply in five
cities, Ma3lang, Purwokerto and Banyuwangi in Java; Jambi in Sumatera; and
Samarinda in Kalimantan. The total population of these five cities is now
about one million and is projected to increase to 1.2 million in 1981 The
project, which is expected to be completed in 1981, would bring public water
supply to 48 percent of this population as compared to 16 percent now. Under
bilateral aid, the Government of Switzerland is financing simillar projects
in two other cities, Jogjakarta and Cirebon in Java. These cities have been
selected by taking into consideration such factors as the importance of the
city as a provincial capital, trade or tourist center, its   development and
economic potential, the adequacy of its present water supply systems, the
capacity of the implementing agency and the financial constraints.    Bank
Group missions preappraised the project in April-May 1973 and appraised
it in November 1973. At negotiations, the Government Delegation was led by
Mr. Racbmat Wiradisurya, Director General of Housing, Building, Planning
and Urban DevelopmentJ Ministry of Public Works and Power. The Appraisal
Report (No. 469-iND) is being circulated to the Executive Directors separately.
30.       The main elements of the sub-project in each city and of the con-
sultant services at the national and local levels are summarized in Annex IIIo
The sub-projects in the respective cities include, as appropriate, development
of surfrce or underground water sources, treatment plants, pumping stations,
storage tanks, transmission mains and primary and secondary distribution mains
including detailed design and construction supervision as well as public stand-
pipes, fire hydrants and public bathhouses. The sub-projects also include the



-8-
provision of miscellaneous equipment, stores and staff housing for the water
enterprises. The project would provide management and technical assistance
to DSE and the water enterprises (WE) for implementing proposed changes in
organization and working procedures as well as feasibility studies for seven
future water supply projects.
Execution of Sub-Projects
31.       DSE would be primarily responsible for the implementation of the sub-
projects. However, the Government will take all necessary measures to ensure
that the ownership and control of the facilities and equipment included in the
sub-projects be vested in the municipal WE's concerned not later than upon
completion of such sub-projects.
Or&ianiza tion
32.        The organization of DSE needs to be strengtheAied in order
to cope with *&£ increases resp.maib±ties resultUng frm these and
other projects included in the National Water Supply Program. The
Government has agreed to a restructuring of DSE and the introduction of
now working procedures, substantially in accordance with the recommendations
of the consultants financed under the Second Technical Assistance Credit
(No.216-IND). Before the proposed loan becomes effective, management con-
sultants will be appointed on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Bank, to help implement, in accordance with the plan agreed with the Bank,
the proposed organizational changes, train DSE't staff, establish new
working procedures, reorganize wunicipal WE's and train personnel at the
local level to operate and mairtain the individual water supply systems.
In order to advance comencement of work on the project, Government has
already apppinted, with the concurrence of the Bank, consultants to carry
out detailed engineering.  The sost of their services after July 31, 1974
would be reimbursed from the proceeds of the loan.
Cost Estimates
33.       The total cost of the project, including consultant services
and feasibility studies for a second group of projects,would be about
US$25.4 million,of which about USh4.0 million would be in foreign
exchange. The table below summarizes the Costs of each sub-project and
of management and technical assistance and the feasibility studies for
a   second group of projects.

Financing Plan
34.       The projects in the five cities are estimted to cost a total of
about US$22.8 million. US$12.3 million of the proposed loan of US$1L.5 million
would cover about 54 percent of the total project cost in the five cities, which
is the estimated foreign exchange cost of materials and supplies and consultant
services for detailed engineering and supervision. The balance of the construc-
tion costs will be financed by loans and net equity contributions from the
Government (23 percent) and internal cash generation and consumer contribu-
tions (23 percent). The cost of consultant services for management and technical
assistance to the Directorate of Sanitary Engineering and to the water enter-
prises and the cost of feasibility studies for the extension of water supply to
a second package of cities in Indonesia are estimated at about US$206 million.
US$2.2 million of the proposed loan would go to finance these costs, including
US$500,000 of local currency expenditures for local consultants.
35.       The financing would be as follows:   US$12.3 million out of the pro-
ceeds of the proposed Bank loan together with Government funds, would be loaned
to WE's at an annual interest rate of 9 percent repayable over 30 years, in-
cluding a grace period of six years for the payment of principal and interest
during which the interest would be waived. The Government would lend to each
WE 60 percent of the project costs and would make available as equity the re-
raining 40 percent of the project costs, except that for Malang and Purwokerto
such percentages would be 70 percent and 30 percent respectively. The WE's
are expected to be able to generate internally during the grace period sufficient
funds to enable them to repay some 60 percent of the initial Government equity
payments. The Government's waiver of interest on loans during the grace period
reflects the need to limit the debt service burden on the WE's so that they may
gradually improve their financial position while avoiding sharp rate increases
which consumers could not sustain.
36.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be relent to each municipal
WE by the Government under a Project Loan Agreement acceptable to the Bank.
All the Project Loan Agreements would be signed before the proposed loan be-
comes effective,
Water Rates and Billings
37.       Financial statements and projections indicate tha; sizeable water
rate increases would be required after fiscal year 1975/76W   to enable the
municipal WE's to meet the needs of their proposed financing plans. The
Government has agreed to take all necessary steps to ensure (a) that the
municipal WE's increase water rates under an agreed schedule in fiscal year
1976/77 and fiscal year 1977/78 and achieve rates of return on the value of
their net fixed assets in operation, revalued from time to time, of at least
1 percent in fiscal year 1978/79; 2 percent in fiscal year 1979/80; 1 percent

whose fiscal year is the calendar year.

in fiscal year 1980/81 and 6 percent in fiscal year 1981/82; and (b) that, the
conclusions of the national standard water rate study concerning the structure
of rates as they affect different classes of consumers will be assessed before
September 30, 1975 and the specific recommendations to be formulated thereafter
will be promptly implemented with the agreement of the Bank. It is estimated
that, after the water rate increases, the average monthly residential billings
for water would remain below 4 percent of average household income, which is
considered a reasonable upper limit. The Government also agreed that all out-
standing Government water bills would be paid by December 31, 1976 and that
all such bills commencing with its fiscal year 1975/76 would be kept current.
Future Finances
38.       Through fiscal year 1980/81, the municipal WE's are expected to
generate enough cash to finance about 20 percent of the construction program
and to provide significant working capital and some additional funds by the end
of the period.
39.       The projections indicate that the debt of the municipal WE's woulci
be relatively high, ranging for the individual WE's between 50 percent and
90 percent and averaging about 66 percent of combined debt and equity in fiscal
year 1981/82   Debt service coverage would range from 1.2 to 2.0 in fiscal. year
1981/82 with the commencement of full debt amortization.
Procurement and Disbursement
40.       All contracts for equipment and material to be financed wider the
project loan would be awarded after international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Qualified local manufacturers would
be accorded a margin of preference of 15 percent or the actual customs duties,
whi.chever is less, for the purposes of bid comparison. Civil works, which
would not be financed under the proposed loan, would be designed in accordance
with standards acceptable to the Bank, but contracts would be awarded on the
basis of local competitive bidding in accordance with government regulations.
41.       The proceeds of the proposed loan would be disbursed against 100
percent of the c.i.f. cost of imported or 95 percent of the ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured equipment and materials procured after international
competitive bidding, including 100 percent of foreign costs for supervision
of installation; and 100 percent of foreign expenditures of foreign consul-
tants and 75 percent of total costs of local consultants.
42.       In view of the urgency of the projects, the consultants started
work on the detailed engineering in August 1974band it is proposed that ex-
-penditues for consultant services after Ju3Ly 31, 1974 be reiibumsed from the
loan. The total amount of retroactive financing involved would not exceed
US $400,000.

Benefits and Justification
431b      The five cities included in the project form a first package of
water supply projects in a long term National Water SupplY Program. In each
city alternative water sources have been studied and least-cost solutions
from among feasible alternatives have been selected for the major elements
o' the project.  Financing will be provided by other bilateral or multi-
l-teral sources for additional cities in  the National Program, and funds
are included in the proposed loan for feasibility studies of water supply
projects in a second group of cities.
4h.       The total population of the cities included in the project is now
abouit one million and is projected to increase to about 1.2 million in 1981.
At present 12 percent of the total population is served by service connec-
tions and , percent by public standpipes.  When the proposed project, which
constitutes the first phase of development, is completed in 1581, these fiures
would increase to 31 percent and 17 percent, respectvively; without the project
they would fall to C0 and 3 respectively.   The proposed investment under the
first phase wculc be about US$39 per person served on the average. A consider-
able effort is needed to keep pace with the growing population and to improve
and extend the water supply service.
45.       The present daily per capita water consumption in the five cities
is estimated to range between   60  and 110 liter per capita per day
(1/cd) for residential service connections and between 8 and 10 1/cd for
public standpipes.  For 1981, consurption is projected at about 100 to 155
l/ci for residential and 12 1/c'd for standpines. which is low compared to
other similar cities in trcpical areaes.
46.       Apart from  helping to extend water supply systems in the five
cities, the proposed project would also contribute toward reorganizing and
strengthening the national level orgonization, DSE, to provide it with the
capability to implement effectively the National wter Supply Program and
bringing about substantial organizotional changes in municipal water enter-
prises, including training programs for their personnel to enable them to
operate and maintain the water systems in accordance with the objectives of
the lNational Program. A long-term objective of the project would be to put
the water supply program on a self-supporting basis by moving from a policy
of grants to municipal WE's to a p-ogram of' loans which would be supported
hy water rates sufficient to senTice debts and finance future investment pro-
grams and extend the systems to serve the entire population in each city.
Rates of Return
47.       The approximate incremental financial rates of return for the
individual sub-projects in the five cities would range from 0.4 percent to
about 7 percent; 0.4 percent for Malang, 4 percent for Purwokerto, 1 percent
for Banyuwangi, 7 percent for Jambi and 3 percent for Samarinda.   These
returns are calculated by measuring benefits by revenues without taking into
consideration health and other related benefits. The wide variation in the



- 13 -
returns is because of the large diCferences in existingr water rate:s among Lhese
cities and the variations in the investment and operating costs for each city.
The existing rates are expected to be increased gradually over the years in
line with the ability of consumers to pay. The substantive justification for
the projects does not rest primarily on the financial forecasts which do not
measure their contribution to the economic and social development of Indonesia,
but rather on the fact that a modest level of water consumption is provided at
least cost and that the health hazards of not doing so are serious.
Ecological Aspect
48.       The provision of safe water to a substantially greater proportion
of the population in the five cities and the construction of a large number
of public bath houses with facilities for washing, bathing and disposal of
human wastes will reduce their dependence on contaminated water sources.
The Government recognizes the urgent need for reducing pollution of streams
and rivers but in the allocation of scarce resources for the sector, the
extension of safe water supply is given first priority. The project does
not include sewerage facilities in the five cities as they could provide
neither the necessary funds nor the trained personnel adequately to maintain
the sewerage systems in addition to expanded water supply systems. DSE is
aware that the sewerage and sewage disposal situation will have to be im-
proved and the terms of reference for the consultants who will carry out the
feasibility studies for the second group of projects will include an assessment
of the needs for sewerage facilities in that group of cities.
PART I - LE(AL INSTdUJMrkNTS AND iAUTHORITfY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Indonesia and t.lhe
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4I (iii)
of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a draft resolution approvin; the
proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
The draft Loan Agreement conforms to the nornml pattern for loans for water
supply projects.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOYMNDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS UNDER IMPLENTATION
Cr. No. 127  Irrigation Rehabilitation: US$5 Million Credit
of September 6. 196.; Closing Date: December 31. 1975
This project includes the supply of earth-moving equipment and
machinery to augment hand labor in rehabilitation work on three irrigation
systems (in Java) and the construction of a fourth (in South Sumatra).
All the equipment supplied under the credit is being well utilized and
disbursements are 98 percent of appraisal timetable. Completion of the
project is expected to be delayed in order to complete much additional
needed drainage work, the financing of which was not provided for under
the credit. These additional costs will be met by the Government. The
revised economic rate of return on the projeot,which was calculated at
50 percent at appraisal, is now expected to be about 25 percent. The
closing date has been postponed to December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 154 Highwaysj US$28 Million Credit of June 20. 19691
Closing Date: December 31., 1974
The project is progressing satisfactorily. Due to delays in
the delivery of the remaining materials and equipment by suppliers, the
closing date will have to be postponed by six months.

Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates; Us$16 Million Credit of
June 20, 1969; Closing Date: December 31, 19 75
This credit is for the rehabilitation of two Government owned
estate groups in North Sumatra. With recent improvements in management and
much higher international prices for rubber the financial situation of the
PNP V estate is improving. Now that field and factory standards have been
raised to a good technical level the management has been advised to concen-
trate on cost control in order to prepare for the time when produce prices
are less attractive than they are today. The combined efforts of the manage-
ment, consultants and IDA supervision missions are yielding good results.
Cr. No. 165 Electricity Distribution; US$15 Million Credit of
October 29, 1969; Closing Date:   June 30, 1975
See comment for Credit No. 334. The closing date has been
postponed by 18 months to June 30, 1975.
Cr. No. 193  PUSRI Fertilizer Expansion; US$35 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970 (as amended Mya 1973   Closing Date:
December 31, 1975
The urea plant has now been completed, was inaugurated in
August by the President and is producing fertilizer. The gas gathering
and transmission system is nearing completion and sufficient gas is
being delivered to the plant for operation.   Despite capital cost in-
creases the project will be quite remunerative. Given the capital costs
that are substantially lower than estimates for similar projects presently
under consideration, and the presently expected long-range international
prices for Urea, the economic rate of return, calculated at 14 percent at
the time of appraisal, is now in excess of 30 percent. Disbursements are
expected to be completed by the Closing Date of December 31, 1975.
Cr. No. 194 Agricultural Estates; US$17 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: June 30, 1975
This project is for the rehabilitation of two Government-
owned estate groups in North Sumatra. During 1973 a record 3,200 ha of
oil palm were planted on PNP VI estate. The 1973 rubber program was
reduced following the adviceof the last Supervision Mission as PNP IV
estate was over-extended; if the high standards of replanting now being
achieved can be maintained, it should be possible to increase the size of
future programs. Management has improved in the field and factory and
reasonable standards are being maintained. More emphasis is required on
cost control and management has agreed to take the necessary action.
Solid progress is being achieved and PNP VI's financial situation has been
greatly helped by the present higher producer prices. PNP IV estate has
also made marked progress during 1973 and 1974 and is in a satisfactory
financial position.

Page 4 of 10 pages
Cr. No. 195 Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US$18.5 Million Credit of
June 15, 1970; Closing Date: November 30, 1976
Problems of quality and progress still exist, but, the
consultants are tackling these vigorously, and the situation is improv-
ing. Costs are likely to exceed the overall appraisal estimate, but
the Government will provide any additional funds required. Completion
of disbursements will be about two years behind the original schedule.
Cr. No. 210 Telecommunications; US$12.8 Million Credit of
July 13, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Orders for all equipment have now been placed. The management
consultants have completed their work but have been retained to implement
their recommendations. The Government has recently increased the tariffs
to achieve the required rate of return and a new charter for PERUMTEL has
also been prepared. The closing datehas been postponed by 18 months due
to delays in delivery of goods.
Cr. No. 2U Fisheries; US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970;
Closing Date:  June 30 197
After a slow start, this project is now progressing satis-
factorily.  Project management satisfactory to the Association has now
been appointed; contracts with engineering and management consultEnts
have been concluded and the consultants have begun work and the contract
for the shore facilities has been awarded.
Cr. No. 216 Technical Assistance II US$4.0 Million Credit of
September 12  1970t ClosinR Date:   December 31. 127
This project is progressing satisfactorily, but it has been
necessary to postpone the closing date by one year to ccvplete disburse-
ments for on-going studies.
Cr. Ko. 219 Education; US$4O6 Million Credit of November 6. 1970;
Closing Date: December 31, 1976
ProJect implementation is generally satisfactory. Civil works
are progressing well and will be completed before end 1975. Tenders for
furniture were invited in June and items will be delivered during the last
month of 1974. Contracts for about 60 percent of the equipment have been
awairded and will be delivered before the TTCs start operations in 19750
The reraIning equipment is being retendered because incomplete bids were
received. All equipment will be delivered by September, 1975. Technical
assistance is provided by Overseas Development Adrministration (ODA) of
the United Kingdom. Cost overruns on construction, furniture, and equipment,
and savings on technical assistance will probably result in a total cost
overrun of about 30 percent above the appraisal estimate. The Government
will provide funds to meet this overrun.

Cr. No. 220 Irrigation Rehabilitation II; US$14.5 Million Credit of
Novemlber 6, 1970; Closing Date: December 31, 1275
This project covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabilitation and
re-introduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systems, two
in Java and one in South Sulawesi. Construction remains about two years
behiind schedule. The problems with preparation of contract documents,
which have caused this delay, have been overcome and, while no further
delays are expected, it is unlikely that the time lost could be regained.
There has been some increase in overall project costs, which is being met
by the Government. Sensitivity tests run at the time of appraisal showed
that a two year delay and 15 percent cost overrun would reduce the economic
rate of return from 25 percent to 21 percent.
Cr. No. 246 Seeds; US$7_5 Million Credit of May 14, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30, 1277
Project implementation is behind schedule due to initial
delays in organization, management and procurement. The latest
supervision mission has reported that development of the Seed Farm is
hampered by the slow execution of a contract to develop irrigation infras-
tructure. Project agencies and the Government are now discussing steps
which need to be taken for timely completion of the irrigation works. The
establishment of rice-seed research facilities at the project site is
progressing slowly due to difficulties in recruiting qualified local staff
to work at the somewhat isolated site in the absence of adequate salary
compensation under civil service regulations. This matter is now being
reviewed within the Bank before being discussed with the Government. The
seeds certification service is performing well and development of the
Klaten Seed District is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 259 Tea; US$15 Million Credit of June 24, 1271;
Closing Date:  June 30. 197
This credit is for the rehabilitation for two groups of
Govenunent-owned tea estates in West Java. Despite management weaknesses
in cost control and efficiency, progress to date is satisfactory and
relationslips between management and consultants are good. Recently
revised cost estimates for factory rehabilitation and expansion are sub-
stantially above appraisal estimates and project consultants are reviewing
them.
Cr. No. 260 HighwaysII; US$35 Million Credit of June 24, 1971;
Closing Date: September 30. 1975
This project in Sumatra consists of construction of
about 2)O kc' of highway, detailed engineering of further highway
Zections and a regional development study. All construction work is
now satisfactorily underway. However, the delay caused initially by
slow progress on mobilizing contractors, difficulties in equipment
delivery, heavy rains and land slides will result in the project being
completed about one year behind schedule.   Design standards for the road
sections have been slightly lowered and some savings will therefore be
achieyed.  These and other savings are expected to offset construction
cost increases.

Cr. No. 275  Technical Assistance III;  US$4.0 Million Credit of
December 29, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1975
Progress on this project is satisfactory. The closing date
has been postponed to complete disbursements for ongoing studies.
Cr. No. 288 Second Education- US$6.3 Million Credit of
March 9, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
Working drawings and furniture and equipment lists for all
project institutions are almost completed. Physical facilities will be
completed by October 1976 and all project institutions will begin opera-
tions by the end of 1976. However, this schedule depends greatly on
timely provision of adequate government funds, which because of an expected
cost overrun of US$8.6 million will have to be substantially increased.
Postponement of the closing date by about six months is likely to be
required.
Cr. No. 289  Irrigation Rehabilitation IV; US$12.5 IMillion Credit
of March 9. 1972; Closing Date:  June 30, 1977
The project is located in East Java and consists of rehabili-
tation of the irrigation system and the re-establishment of satisfactory
operation and maintenance procedures in five non-contiguous areas total-
ling 229,000 ha, known as Pekalen-Sampean. It also provides for the
employment of consultants to assist in the execution of Pekalen-Sampean
and for feasibility studies of further irrigation rehabilitation projects,
Civil works and equiprmient purchase for the main project, Pekalen-Sampean,
are just beginning and completion of civil works will be about one year
behind schedule. Consultants for the various studies are at work with
their counterparts. Groundwater Lrvestigations will be delayed due to
procurement difficulties. The rehabilitation and storage feasibility
studies are on schedule. Disbursements are on schedule.
Cr. No. 300  Polation; US$3.2 Pillion Credit of April 20, 1972;
Closing Date: June )0-, 127d
Progress under the project continues to be hampered by manage-
ment weaknesses and delays in obtaining local currency funds because of
restrictive Government budgetary procedures. Vehicle procurement, which
has been delayed due to the Government ban on importing fully built-up
cars, is now proceeding satisfactorily. After initial delays, construction
of health centers is now proceeding.
Cr. No. 310 Development Finance; US$lO Million Credit of
June 7, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
This credit is now nearly fully committed. Disbursements are
expected to rase rapidly.

Cr  o.lN2.   8  Inter-Island Fleet Rehabilitation; US$8.5 Million
Credit Of June 28 1972; Closing Date: September 30, 1976
Progress on this project is satisfactory but the weak finan-
cial position of PELNI, the Government-ownied shipping company and mair.
sub-borrower, has caused concern. An audit of PEINI has been completed
and iP consultation with the Association and BAPIfWO, the Government is
taking appropriate action to strengthen PELNI's financial position.
Cr. No. 319 Agricultural Estates IV; US$11 Million Credit of
June 28, 1972; Closing Date: June 30, 1981
This project includes the rehabilitation of a Government owned
estate group in southern Sumatra.  It includes planting or replanting of
11,000 ha of oil palms and rubber; improved upkeep of 12,000 ha of exist-
ing immature and mature plantations; fertilizers, agriciultural machinery;
estate housing and vehicles; processing facilities; rehabilitation of the
port palm oil bulking installation; and technical assistance for management,
research, crop diversification and marketing. The project has recovered
from initial delays and has made the best progress of any of the Indonesian
estates prolects.  There is a need, however, for much increased attention
to training of the top management staff.  Agricultural corditions are nowx
generally very good, rubber production is 50 percent higher than ir. the
corresponding period of 1973 and financial control is slowly improving.
Increased emphasis is now being placed on estate cost accounting and
accura.te budgetting.
Cr. No. 334 aectricity Distribution II; US$40 Million Credit of
September 29., 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1976
The Jakarta Distribution Project, financed from Credits 165
and 3.  INL (together US$55 million), is proceeding satisfactorily.  The
tot:l foreign cost is presently estimated at US$56.2 million, about
Us.$1.? miilion above the Credit amounts.  The Government is expected to
Linarce the overrun. Completion is expec+ted by end 1976.
Cr. No._355  Beef Cattle Development; US$3.6 Million Credit of
January 31, 197;i Closing Dates March 31, 1980
This project fo-r development of beef cattle production in the
outer islands is now making progress after a slow start, caused largely
i)y de?lays in clearance of documents by Indonesian Govermuent departments
andi consequent lack of essential equipment.  Land acquisition is proving
more difficult than expected.

Cr. No. 358 North Sumatra Smallholder Development, US$5 Million Credit
of February 14 1973; Closing Date: December 31. 19 1
This credit became effective on August 13, 1973 and has suffered
from severe financial and organizational difficulties due primarily to the
lac's of experience of project management, the remote location of the project
and inadequate Central Government support. The Resident Staff has been
following the project closely. Government has taken a number of steps to
ovet2ome the problems and accelerate project implementation.  Project
progress will continue to be closely monitored.
Cr. No. 387 Education III: US$13.5 Million Credit of
June 1, 1973; Closing Date: December 31. 1981
This credit was declared effective on August 30, 1973. Manu-
script preparation and testing are on schedule and the first year's staff
training programs will be completed in sufficient time to enable the mobile
teacher training teams to start operation in January 1975 as planned.
Equipment procurement, which has been delayed by about nine months partly
because of the Government's reluctance to permit the import of vehicles,is
now under way. Because of the sharp increase in worldwide paper prices and
shortage of supply, difficulty will be experienced in obtaining sufficient
paper under the Canadian loan included in the project financing for the
1975 printing schedule; the Central Government has undertaken to release
supplies from its stockpile. The expected cost overrun arising from
increased paper prices will be met by the Indonesian Government.
Project management is good and the team of technical assistance specialists
is operating effectively.
Cr. No. 388 Highways IlI; US$14 Million Credit of June 1. 1973;
Closing Date: June 30. 1977
This credit is for the construction of 124 km, of highway and
two bridges in North Sulawesi and the study and detailed engineering of
further highways ir. Java, Construction bidding and consultant selection
have been proceeding on schedule. Some cost increases, due to inflation,
are expected, which might be partly offset by savings on other parts of
the project.
Cr. No. 399 West Java Thermal Power; US$16 Million Credit of

Procurements                    Bquipment and materials would be procured
under international competitive bidding
according to the Bank's Guidelines.  Local
manufacturers of imported goods would be
given a 15 percent margin of preference or
the actual customs duty, whichever is
lower, in bid comparisonsB Civil works
contracts, which will not be financed
from the loan, would be awarded under local
competitive bidding, but design standards
would be acceptable to the Bank,
Technical Assistance:           Government's Water Supply Agency (DSE)
would employ consultants for (a) detailed
engineering design and construction super-
vision of the sub-projects; (b) management and
technical assistance on national and local
levels; and (c) feasibility studies for
second group of water supply projects in
seven cities.
Rate of Return:                 Incremental financial rates of return for
the sub-projects would range from 0.b to 7
percent by measuring benefits by incremental
revenues attributable to each sub-project
and with financial costs adjusted for taxes.
However, these revenues do not fully reflect
the health benefits of providing a safe
water supply to the population4
