APPRAISAL OF THE FIVE CITIES WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of projects to increase water
supply and extend the water distribution systems in five cities in
Indonesia - Malang, Purwokerto and Banyuwangi in Java; Jambi in Sumatera;
and Samarinda in Kalimantan. The projects are the first stage, covering
the fiscal years 1975 through 1981, of a master plan for water supply in
the five cities, whose present facilities are inadequate for meeting the
needs of their existing and growing populations, now approximating one
million. These cities, together with the cities of Cirebon and Jogjakarta
whose water supply system extensions are currently proposed to be financed
with the aid of the Swiss Government, were selected by the Government of
Indonesia as a package for purposes of financing. The projects in this
group of seven cities represent.the first-step under a new program by
the Government to improve and extend water supply facilities in cities
throughout Indonesia.
ii.       The Government of Indonesia will be the borrower, and the bene-
ficiaries will be.water enterprises responsible for water supply in the
respective cities. The Directorate of Sanitary Engineering will be the
agency of the Government responsible for project implementation and construc-
tion supervision. The water supply facilities will be owned and operated by
the water enterprises in the respective cities. The Directorate of Sanitary
Engineering will employ consultants to assist and train its staff in the
performance of its functions with respect to the projects and the national
water supply program throughout Indonesia and to train the staffs of the
water enterprises in operating and maintaining the extended facilities in the
cities.
iii.      The objective of the projects is to provide piped water supply
to the extent practicable in the first stage to areas of the cities which
do not have public supplies of potable water and to provide facilities to
ensure a continuous water supply and meet increasing water demands in the
project areas. Present water demands are far in excess of the capacities
of the existing systems, and large areas of the cities do not have public
water supplies. Unless the projects are constructed, serious shortages
will continue with increasing public health problems. The objective is also
to develop the organizational structure and procedures of the national agency
to enable it to administer effectively financial assistance to local water
enterprises and a national water supply program for Indonesia.
iv.       The projects in the five cities include well drilling, cons-
truction of river intake facilities, pumping stations, treatment plants,
transmission and distribution facilities, the installation of new service
connections, public standpipes and bathhouses, and the improvement of



- ii -
existing service. The total population of the five cities to be served with
potable water as a result of the projects is estimated to increase from about
160,000 or 16% of total population, to 590,000 or 48% of total population.
v.        The projects in the five cities are estimated to cost a total of
about US$22.8 million (Rp 9,442 million). The proposed loan of US$14.5 mil-
lion includes US$12.3 million to cover about 54% of the total project cost
in the five cities, which is the estimated foreign exchange component and
cost of consultant services for detailed engineering and supervision. The
balance of the construction costs will be financed by loans and contributions
from the Government and internal cash generation. The cost of consultant
services for management and technical assistance to the Directorate of Sani-
tary Engineering and to the water enterprises and the cost of feasibility
studies for the extension of water supply to a second package of cities in
Indonesia are estimated at about US$2.6 million (Rp 1,100 million), against
which US$2.2 million of the proposed loan will be disbursed.
vi.       All contracts for material and equipment needed for the projects
will be awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Con-
struction contracts will not be financed under the proposed loan and will
be awarded on the basis of local competitive bidding. Most of the mate-
rial and equipment will be imported, but some items such as small diameter
pipes could be supplied by local manufacturers who will receive a prefer-
ence of 15% or the prevailing tariff, whichever is lower.
vii.      The major elements of the program represent the least-cost solu-
tion from among feasible alternatives at discount rates in the 10 to 12%
range. The internal financial rate of return on the individual projects
in the respective cities is estimated to vary from 0.4% to approximately
7%. These returns are calculated by measuring benefits by revenues with-
out taking into consideration health and other related benefits. The
wide variation in the returns is because of the large differences in
existing water rates among the cities and the variations in the invest-
ment and operating costs for each city. The existing rates are expected
to be increased gradually over the years in line with the ability of con-
sumers to pay. The substantive justification for the projects does not
rest primarily on the financial forecasts which do not measure their con-
tribution to the economic and social development of Indonesia, but rather
on the fact that a modest level of water consumption is provided at least
cost and that the health hazards of not doing so are serious.
viii.     The projects are suitable for an IBRD loan of US$14.5 million for
a period of thirty years, including a grace period of 6 years. The Govern-
ment of Indonesia will relend US$12.3 million of the proceeds of the loan
to the respective beneficiaries at an interest rate of 9% per annum repay-
able over 30 years, including a grace period of 6 years, during which in-
terest will be waived.



INDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF THE FIVE CITIES WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of Indonesia has requested a loan of US$14.5
million to finance the foreign exchange costs of projects to increase the
water supply and extend the water distribution systems in five cities in
Indonesia (Map IBRD 10870) - Malang, Purwokerto and Banyuwangi in Java; Jambi
in Sumatera; and Samarinda in Kalimantan - and to finance services relating
to the national water supply program in Indonesia. The Government will relend
US$12.3 million of the proceeds of the loan to water enterprises which will
own and operate the water systems in the respective cities. These projects
are estimated to cost a total of US$22.8 million equivalent. The proposed
IBRD loan includes US$2.2 million for services to, and training of, the
national and local organizations by consultants in order to implement the
projects and permit the Government to extend this program to other cities
and to finance a feasibility study for a second package of water supply
projects selected by the Government for financing.
1.02      The projects are part of a long-term plan for the development
of water supply in the five cities. The projects in these cities, together
with the cities of Cirebon and Jogjakarta which are proposed to be financed
with the aid of the Swiss Government, were selected by the Government of
Indonesia as a package for purposes of financing. This group of projects
represents a first step by the Government of Indonesia in a program to
improve and extend water facilities throughout Indonesia.
1.03      The Directorate of Sanitary Engineering will be the agency of
the Government of Indonesia primarily responsible for the implementation
of the projects. New water enterprises are being established in each of the
five cities to operate and maintain the systems.
1.04      An IDA reconnaissance mission visited Indonesia in July-August
1970 and in February 1971 to identify the principal problems in the urban
water supply and sewerage sector and to assess possible solutions. The
report, issued on December 9, 1971 (PU-81), emphasized the need, recognized
by the Government of Indonesia, to move the existing financing policy of
the Government from a grant to a loan approach and to consideration of the
entire water supply system requirements rather than only source and trans-
mission facilities. The report also included recommendations for studies
which would (a) identify and consider solutions to the problems involved in
a change of policy from grants to loans in financing municipal water projects,
(b) formulate the procedures to be followed, nationally and locally, in
administering the loan program, (c) suggest the required changes in organ-
ization and staffing required to implement the loan program, and (d) lead
to the selection of five or six cities where preliminary engineering and
feasibility studies could be carried out and which would serve as the pilot
cities for initiating and testing of the loan program.



-2-
1.05      Following the sector study, the Government of Indonesia requested
IDA assistance for feasibility and organizational studies as a first step in
implementing the recommendations in the sector study, and consultant serv-
ices for this purpose were financed under Technical Assistance Credit No.
Cr. 216. In 1972-1973 the consultants prepared master plans and feasibility
studies for water supplies in seven cities (Malang, Purwokerto, Banyuwangi,
Jambi, Samarinda, Cirebon and Jogjakarta) and studies for developing oAgani-
zations at the national and local levels which could successfully undertake
a water supply program. The studies were made by Nihon Suido Consultants
Company, Ltd. of Tokyo, in association with James M. Montgomery Consulting
Engineers Inc. of Pasadena; Sycip, Gorres, Velayo & Co. of Manila, manage-
ment consultants; and Indonesian Contracting Engineering Service of Jakarta.
The studies have been supervised and reviewed by IDA and form the basis for
the projects included in this report.
1.06      A pre-appraisal mission composed of Messrs. V. Rajagopalan,
L. Rasmusson and K.C. Smeltzer visited Indonesia in April-May 1973, and an
appraisal mission of the latter two persons visited Indonesia in November-
December 1973. In June 1973, the Swiss Government advised that it would
finance the water supply projects for Cirebon and Jogjakarta and that the
appraisal of these projects would be conducted by its representatives.
Accordingly, the projects in the other five cities are the subject of this
appraisal report.
II. THE SECTOR
Background
2.01      Indonesia, with a population of about 128 million and growing at
an annual rate of more than 2%, is the world's fifth ranking country in
population. It comprises over 3,000 inhabited islands which extend about
5,000 km east to west and 2,000 km north to south. The land area is about
1.9 million km2 and the four major islands are Java, Sumatera, Kalimantan
and Sulawesi. The population density of Indonesia is about 65 inhabitants
per km2. Java, which has 69% of the total population of Indonesia but only
7% of the land area, has a population density of 600 per km2, one of the
highest in the world. Over 20 million of the population is urban, living
in cities of more than 5,000 inhabitants, and urbanization of the country
is accelerating.
2.02      Indonesia's economy is generally based on agriculture (about half
of the national product), which provides employment and income for more
than 70% of the population. Oil and gas are Indonesia's most important
natural resources. Indonesia's general economic climate has improved over
the past few years with a promising start on development. The Government's
current development planning is based on an estimated growth of the economy
of 7.5% annually.



-3-
2.03      Indonesia is divided administratively into 23 provinces and
2 territories, which are in turn divided into regencies or districts. The
cities, depending on their size, have their own municipal governments or are
administered by the regency governments.
Sector Organization and Management on National and Local Levels
2.04      Two ministries are responsible for national water supply and
sewerage planning -- the Ministry of Public Works and Power for urban
areas, defined as Municipalities with a population larger than 5,000, and
the Ministry of Health for rural areas. The Ministry of Mines through its
Geological Survey is in charge of groundwater exploration and relevant data
collection. Funds made available for water supply and sewerage projects
in Indonesia's annual development budget are allocated by the National
Development Planning Board, BAPPENAS.
2.05      The Ministry of Health is organized into two units, General and
Sanitary Engineering Division, and Directorate of Hygiene and Sanitation.
Their responsibilities are mainly technical advisory services on water
quality control, design, construction, and related aspects on environmental
sanitation. Within the Ministry of Public Works and Power, the Directorate
General of Water Sources deals mainly with water rights, allocations of
water resources, and the development of water resources for agricultural
purposes. The Directorate General of Housing, Building, Planning and Urban
Development (Cipta Karya) is in charge of urban water supply and sewerage.
2.06      Cipta Karya through its Directorate of Sanitary Engineering (DSE)
is the implementing agency for water supply and sewerage projects with the
functions of project planning and project selection, fund allocations,
preliminary and detailed engineering, construction supervision and, occasionally,
operation and maintenance of water supply systems.
2.07      The municipalities or regencies are usually responsible for operation
and maintenance of the water works and for extension of the distribution
systems. The water works entities are usually a part of the municipal
or regency government, and their organization and degree of dependency
vary from city to city. The water revenues usually barely cover operation
and maintenance costs, and very few replacements or extensions of the
distribution systems have been carried out during the last 30 years.
Sector Needs and Development
2.08      A considerable portion of the total urban population lives in
cities with no public water supply, and where public water supply exists
it is inadequate and serves only a small part of the population. Most people
are dependent on dug wells, streams or rivers with attendant substantial
health risks. Most existing water supply systems suffer from low pressure
and intermittent supply, and safe water entering the system will not always
remain uncontaminated.



-4-
2.09      The water supply needs of the rural population, living in more
than 50,000 villages and comprising about 80% of the total population, pre-
sent a formidable problem.  Water is mainly obtained from dug wells, streams
or rivers, which in most cases are contaminated. A ve-ty li^mited program for
organized and safe water supply is assisted by UNICEF/WHO, but a negligible
percentage of the rural population is involved.
2.10      The urban population served by sewerage systems is very small.
Human wastes are mainly discharged into septic tanks, latrines, surface
drainage ditches, or directly into streams and rivers, and dov4titute a
hazard for non public water supplies by pollution of wells, streaas and rivers.
2.11      Between 1959 and 1965 very few water supply schemes were cons-
tructed in Indonesia.  Some have been constructed since 1965 ot have been
under construction as part of the 5-year plan for fiscal yeats 1970 through
1974, instituted by the Government to implement a broad progtam of economic
development. Many of these improvements will not supply more consumers
because the works financed from national funds have been almost exclusively
confined to stpply and transmission facilities; municipalities or regencies
do not have the funds needed to extend distribution sytteas.
2.12      The table below shows investments during 1970-74 by DSE on water
supply and sewerage projects. The funds have been provided 8s grMats.

At the levels of investment shown above the country may well Lose ground in
its attempts to supply a larger percentage of the population with safe water
unless major changes are made. Only 3% of the five-year plan allocation has
been spent on drainage and sewerage works, which hardly covers elementary
needs.
2.13      The budget allocation for rural water supply in the five~-year
plan (1970-74) amounted to Rp 140 million (US$337,000). The cost of rural
water supply construction in the five-year plan is estimated at less than
US$1.0 million including the UNICEF/WHO contribution. The second five-year



-5-
plan (1975-79) has greater provision for rural water supply, about US$4 to
5 million. This rate of investment will have only a small impact on the
problem. However, the organization to carry out a massive program efficiently
does not yet exist, even if aU the funds required were to be provided.
III. THE BORROWER, THE IMPLEMENTING AGENCY AND THE BENEFICIARIES
The Borrower
3.01      The Government of Indonesia through its Ministry of Finance will
be the borrower and will relend the major part of the proceeds of the loan
to the beneficiaries which will be the water enterprises (WE's) established
to take over the responsibility for water supply in each of the five project
cities. DSE will be the implementing agency.
The Directorate of Sanitary Engineering
3.02      DSE is responsible for the national water supply program includ-
ing investigation, planning, design and construction supervision of urban
water supply and sewerage projects. The responsibility for extension of
distribution systems rests in the local authorities, but will be taken over
by the WE's.
3.03      DSE's present organization is composed of four divisions -
Planning Survey and Design, Water Supply, Sewerage, and Logistics - and
three organizational units - Project Aid, Secretariat, and Project Manage-
ment for construction supervision. The divisions and units are further
subdivided into sections. The total number of staff in FY 1973 was 137,
including 27 qualified engineers of whom 14 have overseas training. Another
33 staff members have lower engineering degrees. There are numerous vacancies
in the organization due to recruitment difficulties and the necessity for use
of engineers in the field for construction supervision and water system
operation and maintenance. The staff members have generally good theoretical
background but lack practical planning and design experience.
3.04      The consultants, financed under the Technical Assistance Credit
(para 1.05), reviewed the existing organization of DSE, and recommended
changes to enable it to cope with the increased work load and responsibilities
under the program. The organization will be restructured substantially in
accordance with the recommendations and a chart of the proposed organization
is shown in Annex 1. The new organization will comprise five divisions:
Planning and Evaluation, Survey and Design, Construction, Logistics, and
Technical Assistance. There will also be units for Special Staff and for
Finance and Administration. The Survey and Design Division will be composed
of three existing divisions to achieve a concentration of the design capacity.
The Construction Division will be a new division subdivided geographically
into three sections. The Logistics Division will be strengthened. The
Technical Assistance Division will conduct training of staff members on the
national and local levels through seminars or in-service training and will



-6-
assist in the establishment of WE's. The Planning and Evaluation Division
will play an important role in the development of projects for the national
water supply program. The present Secretariat will be strengthened to form
the Finance and Administration Unit and will include a section for financial
planning and loan administration. In the past, funds for development and
extensions of water supply facilities have been given as grants from the
national government to the local governments, but this procedure will be
changed under the new program and all money allocations will be as loans and
equity payments.  External loans, such as the proposed IBRD one-, will
also be channelled through DSE.
3.05      The restructured organization will require new working procedures
for loan applications, awarding of contracts, fund releases and loan repay-
ments. The Planning and Evaluation Division will review the water supply
requirements in the cities, prepare feasibility reports and establish criteria
for project selection. The Finance and Administration Unit will, inter alia,
assist in the preparation of loan applications and subsidiary loan agreement
documents. DSE will implement projects up to the stage of commissioning when
they will be turned over to the local WE's. The Bank of Indonesia will be
the channel for effecting financial transactions such as fund releases and
loan repayments.
3.06      The changes in organization, working procedures and expected
workload will require an increase in the number of staff and improvements
in their performance. The total staff is projected to rise from the pres-
ent 137 to 177 in 1980. Assistance from management and engineering con-
sultants will be needed to implement the changes in organization and working
procedures and to expand DSE's engineering capacity. Provision for neces-
sary consultant services for this purpose is included in the proposed loan.
3.07      It was agreed during negotiations that the reorganization of DSE
and the introduction of proposed working procedures will be implemented and
additional staff will be recruited according to agreed time schedules.
Existing Water Works Organizations and
Water Supply Facilities in the Five Cities
3.08      The water works organizations in the five cities vary in their
structure and degree of dependency. They are geared to operation and
maintenance only, and construction works are confined mainly to minor
extensions of distribution mains, pipe replacements and consumer connec-
tions. The existing water works are described briefly below, in more
detail in Annex 2, and are shown on Maps IBRD 10871 to 10875.
3.09      In MALANG the water works is operated by three departments of
the municipal organization: Public Works, Finance, and Local Enterprises
Departments. The number of staff is about 130. The water works supplies
about 23,000 m3/day and serves about 30% of the total population of
422,000 by 13,000 service connections or by standpipes. From two springs,
Binangun and Karangan, the water gravitates to balancing storage tanks at
Dinoyo and Betek, and then to the distribution system. The distribution
system is subdivided into two pressure zones, each supplied from its
storage tank.



-7-
3.10      In PURWOKERTO the Public Works Department of the Regency operates
the water works through two divisions, the Technical and the Administration
Divisions. The number of staff is about 25. The water works supplies
about 1,400 m3/day and serves about 3% of the total population of 211,000
by 1,300 service connections. From a spring at Kawung Carang the water
after treatment gravitates to a balancing storage tank and then to the
distribution system.
3.11      In BANYUWANGI water supply is the responsibility of a unit within
the department of local enterprises of the Regency. The water works is sub-
divided into a Technical Divison and an Administration and Cashier Unit.3
The number of staff is about 20. The water works supplies about 1,200 m /
day and serves about 6% of the total population of 78,000 by 1,300 service
connections. From the Gedor Spring the water gravitates to a break
pressure tank and balancing storage tanks and then to the distribution
system. The distribution system is subdivided into two pressure zones.
3.12      In JAMBI water supply is directly under the office of the Mayor
and it is subdivided into five divisions, Administration, Collection, Tech-
nical, Pumps, and Repairs Divisions. The number of staff is about 55. The
water works supplies 650 m3/day and serves about 3% of the total population
of 166,000 by 1,500 service connections. From the Batang Hari River the
water is pumped to a treatment plant for chemical flocculation, sedimentation
and rapid sand filtration. The treated water is pumped to an elevated
storage tank for distribution to the service area. The immediate improvement
program, currently under way, will increase the water supply by FY 1976 to
about 2,500 m3/day.
3.13      In SAMARINDA water supply is directly under the office of the Mayor,
but is supervised in technical matters by the Municipal Public Works Depart-
ment. The water supply unit is subdivided into two divisions, the Adminis-
tration and Financial and the Technical Divisions. The number of staff is
about 25. The water works supplies 915 m3/day and serves about 14% of the
total population of 106,000 by 1,000 service connections and standpipes.
From the Mahakam River the water is pumped to a treatment plant for chemical
flocculation, sedimentation and rapid sand filtration. The treated water is
collected in a clear well from where it gravitates to the service area. The
immediate improvement program, currently under way will increase the water
supply by FY 1975 to about 3,100 m3/day.
3.14      The existing water supply systems in the five cities suffer
from low or intermittent pressure. Many meters are in need of repair or
replacement, and in Jambi and Samarinda services are not metered. The
operation and maintenance of facilities have suffered from shortages of
trained personnel because of the lack of funds and organization. The
accounting systems are inadequate to provide meaningful financial state-
ments or information for management control. Water rates have been suf-
ficient only to cover current cash expenses and provide small surpluses which
have been devoted to general uses without sufficient attention to the
existing and expanding needs of the community for water supply.



-8-
3.15      The five cities have very limited and rudimentary sewerage
systems. Except for some septic tanks, there is no sewage treatment.
The sewage is generally discharged into open channels, streams or rivers,
polluting the water sources, including dug wells, on which most of the
population depends.
Proposed Water Enterprises
3.16      The implementation of the water supply program will considerably
increase the responsibilities of the existing water works organizations
in the five cities. As the supply areas are expanded, revenues from water
sales will increase substantially, and effective operating procedures,
accounting systems and management controls will be needed. To cope with
such increased responsibilities in the five cities and in other cities
which will have their water supply systems expanded, changes in organiza-
tion and working procedures are needed. Studies have been carried out by
the management consultant, SyCip, Gorres, Velayo & Co., under the Technical
Assistance Credit (para 1.05) and they have recommended reorganization of
the water works as shown in Annex 3.
3.17      The organizational structures for all cities will be substantially
the same with minor variations to accommodate the differences in the water
supply systems. The WE will be controlled by a water board to be composed
of representatives of the local and national governments. The Board will
appoint a Managing Director, who, with the assistance of the Finance and
Administration Director and the Chief Engineer, will be responsible for
implementing board policy and for day-to-day control.
3.18      Under the proposed organization, the WE's are being set up as
entities (Perusahaan Daerah) separate from the local governments, accounting
separately for their operations and retaining their own revenues from which
they will meet operating and capital expenditures and debt service. General
regulations for regional enterprises are spelled out in Act No. 5, Year 1962,
and particular regulations or charters within this framework have been issued
by the local governments for water works organizations. WE's have already
been established for Malang, Purwokerto and Samarinda and will be established
for Banyuwangi and Jambi before the proposed loan becomes effective. During
negotiations it was agreed that (i) each municipality or regency will transfer
to the appropriate WE the water works and all assets used in its operations,
including all receivables and accrued assets and a sufficient amount of
working capital to enable it to continue its operations; and (ii) each WE
will enter into a project loan agreement, acceptable to IBRD, with the
National Government for the related project. A condition of effectiveness of
the proposed loan is that all five project loan agreements will have been
signed.
3.19      The existing water systems have been operated under the supervision
of chiefs of public works departments which have functions in addition to
water supply. In view of this and the need for qualified financial and
technical personnel, particularly at management levels, to operate the expanded



-9-
and modernized systems, recruitment of Managing Directors and Chief Engineers,
and in most cases Finance and Administration Directors, will be required.
During negotiations agreement was reached that in each case a Managing
Director and Chief Engineer will be appointed before the project loan agree-
ment is signed and that the Finance and Administration Director and accountant
will be appointed within six months of the signing of the project loan
agreement. However, it may be necessary to fill the posts of Chief Engineer
and Finance and Administration Director on a temporary basis by seconding
staff from DSE or the municipality concerned, to serve also a8 Managing
Directors and accountants, respectively.
Required Management and Technical Assistance
3.20      DSE will require assistance and advisory services of a consulting
firm to ensure the effective implementation of the water supply program at
both the national and local levels. Specialists will be needed in organization,
management, accounting systems, finance, engineering, operation, maintenance
and training in these areas. The consultant would assist with (a) organizing
and training the DSE staff to implement proposed organizational changes;
(b) the establishment of new working procedures, operating objectives and
responsibilities, and training people to accomplish them; and (c) reorganizing
municipal water works operations, and training personnel at the local level
to operate and maintain effectively the individual water works system. Provi-
sion for consultant services for three years is included in the proposed loan.
DSE is currently negotiating a contract with SyCip, Gorres, Velayo & Co.,
which prepared the previous management and organizational studies (para 1.05),
The engagement of consultants will be a condition of effectiveness of the
proposed loan. The progress of the consultant's work will be reviewed by
DSE and IBRD periodically, and any changes or revisions needed will be
introduced.
Audit
3.21      The accounts of the water works are not kept on a commercial
accounting basis, and the usual financial statements for utility enterprises
are not prepared. While there generally are periodic reviews of receipts
and expenditures under the municipal systems by governmental authorities,
audits are not made under generally accepted accounting standards. The
accounts of each water enterprise will be audited annually by independent
auditors acceptable to IBRD. The first audit will cover accounts for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 1976, or March 31, 1977, as appropriate
(See para 6.02), and the auditor's report and financial statements will
be sent to IBRD not later than six months after the close of each fiscal
year.

IV. THE PROJECTS
Description
4.01      The projects are the first stage, covering the years 1975 through
1981, of a master plan prepared by the consultants for water supply in the
five cities (para 1.05). Only about 16% of the total population in the
project areas of the five cities is now served with potable water through
service connections or standpipes by the existing water supply facilities.
The first stage projects will increase the percentage of population served
to 48% in 1981, and the master plan program contemplates a further increase
to 75% in 2001. (Population and water demand projections for each city
are shown in Annex 8).
4.02      The principal elements of the project in each city and of the
consultant services at the national and local levels are listed below. The
proposed works are described in detail in Annex 4 and the layout of each
system is shown on Maps IBRD 10871 to 10875.
Malang
1.   Development of the Mendit Spring with collection structure,
treatment plant, clearwell and booster pumping station;
2.   about 58 km of transmission and distribution mains;
3.   booster pumping station and service reservoir; and
4.   test well drilling for possible ground water development
for the second stage.

In addition, the project in each city will include service
connections, public standpipes, public bathhouses, motor
vehicles, laboratory equipment and staff housing and, where
required, stores and office accommodation.
Consultant Services
1.   Detailed engineering design and construction supervision
by foreign and local consultants for the projects;
2.   management and technical assistance on the national and
local levels for implementation of proposed changes in
organizations and working procedures; and
3.   feasibilities studies for a second package of seven
water supply projects.
Cost Estimates
4.03      The total estimated costs for the projects in the five cities
and for consultant services are summarized in the table below. The
project costs, subdivided into items and into the years in which they
are projected to be spent, are shown in Annex 5.

4.04      The costs for civil works are consultant's estimates based on
preliminary design for the water works, relevant unit prices in the respective
cities, and unit prices for similar projects in other places duly adjusted
to the particular local conditions in the five cities.  The costs for equip-
ment and material are based on consultant's estimates which were adjusted
during appraisal to July 1973 prices.  The physical contingency allowance of
25% of the 1973 costs is considered appropriate because of the nature of the
works in making extensions to the distribution systems which constitute a
major part of the projects. Price contingencies applied to the base prices
and physical contingencies from July 1973 through the construction period
are: for 1973 (July-December) 10% on foreign costs and 24% on local; for
1974 14% and 18%, respectively; for 1975 11% and 15%; and for 1976 and
thereafter 7.5% and 12% annually. The cost estimates do not include any
duties or taxes on imported goods financed under the proposed loan, since
DSE is exempted by the Government from ouch charges.
4.05      The costs for detailed engineering are based on a draft contract
between DSE and the consultant and the costs for construction supervision
are consultant's estimates based on length of construction period and man-
power requirements* The costs for management and tecbnical assistance are
based on a draft contract, and the costs for the next package feasibility
studies are based on actual costs for the first package duly adjusted.
Amount of Proposed Loan
4.06      An IBRD loan of US$14.5 million, equal to 57% of the total project
cost of US$25.4 million, is proposed and would be allocated as follows:
US$ million            %

4.07      In view of the urgency to commence the projects, the detailed
engineering should be started as soon as possible. It is proposed that IBRD
reimburse the expenditures after July 31, 1974, for consultant services.
The total retroactive financing involved will not exceed US$0.4 million.
Design, Construction and Supervision of Construction
4.08      A project implementation schedule is in Annex 6.  DSE will be
responsible for the implementation of the projects in the five cities. The
water works will be handed over to the WE's after commissioning. However,
in Samarinda and Jambi DSE will retain responsibility for operation for
such time as is needed. DSE's planning, design and construction supervisory
capacity is limited and consultants are proposed to be engaged for detailed
engineering, preparation of bidding documents, bid evaluation and construction
supervision.
4.09      The projects prepared by the consultants were substantially
changed during the appraisal as a result of technical and economic evalua-
tions. Although final designs are unlikely to be materially different,
changes in details are expected. It was agreed during negotiations that the
consultants will submit to DSE and IBRD the detailed designs for project
components before preparing tender documents.
4.10      DSE is negotiating a contract with Nihon Suido Consultants Company
Ltd., Japan, in association with James M. Montgomery Consulting Engineers
Inc., U.S.A., which prepared the feasibility studies (para 1.05). Nihon
Suido intends to sublet part of the consultant works to a local consultant
firm, P.T. Sangkuriang, Bandung. This arrangement is satisfactory.
4.11      For the second package of feasibility studies, IBRD has reviewed
terms of reference and has approved a short list of consultants. The
consultants will be'employed on terms and conditions satisfactory to IBRD.
Procurement
4.12      DSE will be in charge of all procurement.  The procurement items
financed by the loan, except consultant services, will be obtained by
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
for Procurement. Material and equipment for the five projects will be grouped
conveniently to attract a wide range of manufacturers and to get the advantages
of bulk deliveries. For bid comparisons, a domestic preference of 15% of
the C.I.F. cost or the applicable custom duties, whichever is lower, will be
allowed. Local manufacturers are expected to compete for the supply of a
few items such as PVC and steel pipes for the distribution systems. The
amount involved would be about US$500,000.
4.13      It is proposed to award construction contracts on the basis of
local competitive bidding according to Government regulations. These con-
tracts will not be financed by the proposed loan. The grouping of the
construction contracts could not conveniently be done for more than one city.



- 15 -
Contracts for pipeline laying works will likely be awarded to a number of
smaller contractors in each city. Other construction works such as intake,
treatment works and storage tanks could be grouped in one contract, which
is not likely to be large enough to attract foreign bidders. In these
circumstances, the contracting arrangement proposed for civil works is
satisfactory.
Disbursement
4.14      The estimated disbursement schedule in Annex 7 indicates that the
loan would be disbursed in the five fiscal years 1975-79. It is proposed
that the disbursement cover (a) 100% of the C.I.F. cost of imported, or 95%
of ex-factory cost of locally manufactured, equipment and materials procured
after international competitive bidding; (b) 100% of foreign costs for su-
pervision of installation of equipment and material procured under (a); (c)
100% of foreign expenditures of foreign consultants; and td) 75% of total
cost of local consultants.
Ecological Aspects
4.15      The provision of a safe water supply to a substantially greater
proportion of the population and the construction of a large number of
public bathhouses with facilities for washing, bathing and disposal of
human wastes will reduce the dependence on contaminated water sources.
Although the urgent need for reducing pollution of the streams and rivers
is recognized, first priority in the allocation of scarce resources for
the sector is considered to be extension Qf water supplies. The project
does not include the provision of sewerage facilities in the five cities as
these cities could not provide the necessary funds nor the trained personnel
for adequate maintenance for sewerage systems in addition to those required
for the expanded water supply systems. DSE is aware that the sewerage and
sewage disposal situation will have to be improved with the next stage of
the water supply development. The terms of reference for the consultants
to be employed on the feasibility studies for the second package will include
an assessment of the needs for sewerage facilities in that group of cities.
V. JUSTIFICATION
Project Objectives and Population and Demand Forecasts
5.01      The five cities form a first package of water supply projects
in a long range development plan for a National Water Supply Program. The
Government's selection of the five cities was based on factors such as the
relative adequacy of their present water supply systems, the availability
of alternative sources of water such as private wells, the importance of the
city as a provincial capital, trade or tourist center or seaport, and the
development and economic potential of the city.



- 16 -
5.02      The project objectives are (a) to reorganize and strengthen the
national level organization, DSE, to provide it with the capability to
implement effectively the National Water Supply Program; (b) to extend the
water supply facilities of the five cities to the extent feasible in a
first stage; and (c) to establish WE's and to train the staffs to operate
and maintain the water systems. The long-range objective is to put the
water supply program on a self-supporting basis using the projects assisted
by the proposed loan as a vehicle. The funds included in the loan for
feasibility studies will provide the means of bringing additional cities
into the program.
5.03      Cholera, typhoid, dysentery and parasitic diseases transmitted
by water are endemic to the general area. Many cases of paratyphoid and
infectious hepatitis have been reported from Java and Sumatera, and cholera
has been in evidence in Central Java. Medical care and public health
programs are spread so thinly and are so deficient in funds and staff that
meaningful data on the actual incidence of waterborne diseases are not
available. It is evident, however, that diseases related to poor sanitation
are among the principal causes of morbidity and mortality.
5.04      The first stage of the long-term master plan will provide, to
the extent practicable, potable water supply to the cities by service
connections or standpipes. The extent of the first stage program has
been decided after consideration of such factors as the capacity of the
implementing agency and of the construction industry, feasible phasing for
extension of water production facilities, availability of alternative water
sources which can be used in the absence of a public water supply, and fi-
nancial constraints. In the service area, people who cannot afford service
connections will be supplied frem. standpipes to be provided as needed.
5.05      Annex 8 shows population and water demand projections for each of
the five cities through 2001. The table below shows for each city the total
population and the population served from the public water supply system in
1972 and projected for 1981.

5.06      As shown in Annex 8, the average annual historical (1961-1971)
and projected (1972-1981) population increases in Indonesia are 2.12% and



- 17 -
2.37%, respectively. For each city, three series of projections (low,
medium and high) have been made and the applied growth rates, which are in
the range of 2.25% to 2.93%, are based on historical growth, present trends,
and development potentials. Of the total population in the five cities,
12% is presently served by service connections and 4% by standpipes; in 1981
these figures are projected .to increase to 31% and 17%; and in 2001 to 52%
and 23%. If these projects are not implemented, the percentage of the
total population of the five cities served from service connections and
standpipes will steadily decrease from about 10% and 3% in 1981 to 6% and
2% in 2001. A considerable effort is obviously needed to keep pace with
the growing population and to improve and extend the water supply service.
5.07      The projected water consumption for each city is shown in Annex 8.
The present daily per capita consumption in the five cities is estimated
to range from about 60 to 110 1/cd for residential service connections and
8 to 10 1/cd for public standpipes. Consumption is projected for FY 1981
at about 100 to 155 1/cd for residential and 12 1/cd for standpipes, which
is comparatively low for cities in tropical areas. The present consumption
figures, which are based on available records and field surveys, are
estimations because of the inadequate and intermittent water supply, absence
of water meters in some cases, and large numbers of faulty meters in others.
The projected demand figures for residential consumption have considered
such factors as the introduction of a continuous water supply, the availa-
bility of alternative water sources in dug wells, and consumers' ability
to sustain the water rates. The projected demand figures in other consumer
categories, such as commercial, industrial and institutional are based on
surveys of these types of consumers carried out in each city. Unaccounted-for
water has been assumed to go down gradually from the present 30% or more to
20% due to replacement of faulty water meters and old pipeline, the substantial
addition of new distribution mains, and an active leakage detection program.
The projected total water production in 1981 is subdivided among the various
categories as: residential consumption 60%; commercial and industrial 8%;
institutional and others 12%; and unaccounted-for water 20%.
Least Cost Solution
5.08      In each city alternative water sources have been studied.  Where
applicable, present worth values have been computed for alternative arrange-
ments, at discount rates in the 10-12% range, and least-cost solutions have
been selected. In Jambi and Samarinda, there are no feasible alternatives
to surface water development, and the sites for intakes and treatment works
have been selected as most suitable from a technical and economical point of
view.
Return on Investment
5.09      The internal financial rates of return for the projects in the
five cities, measuring benefits by the incremental revenues attributable
to them, range from 0.4% to approximately 7%, as shown in Annex 9. The
approximate rates of return for the individual projects, on the assumptions
stated in the annex, are Malang 0.4%, Purwokerto 4%, Banyuwangi 1%, Jambi 7%,



- 18 -
and Samarinda 3%. These rates are low because of the generally low level
of existing water rates. These water rates are to be increased gradually
over the years under the proposed financing plan in accordance with consumers'
ability to pay (para 6.17-6.20).
5.10      It is not possible to calculate a meaningful economic rate of
return for the projects since the major public health benefits to be derived
cannot be measured in monetary terms. The proposed program of works must
be undertaken if the cities, with their increasing populations, are to
alleviate even more serious water shortages and consequential health problems
than those which now exist.
5.11      Important benefits will also be provided by the development
of institutions to carry out sound water supply programs at both the national
and local levels. The creation of organizations with the necessary powers
and authority and the introduction of effective management and operating
procedures are essential steps in advancing the program of water supply
in Indonesia.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Record of Finances
6.01      The accounts of the water supply units in the five cities have
generally been parts of the municipal or regency systems and have been kept
on a cash receipts and disbursements basis which do not account for such
items as receivables, payables, inventories, fixed assets or depreciation.
Review of the finances of the present systems and preparation of the normal
financial statements and projections have been seriously constrained by the
lack of basic data. The financial information presented is necessarily based
to a considerable extent on assumptions which it will be necessary to test
as the projects develop.
6.02      Income statements for the three fiscal years 1972-74 have been
derived or estimated for each WE, based on statements of actual cash receipts
and disbursements for the first one or two fiscal years prepared by the IWE
or municipality. Fixed assets were estimated for the initial balance sheets
as described in para 6.03. The financial statements for the first three fiscal
years were estimated on a cash basis, with allowances for depreciation, and
on an accrual accounting basis thereafter. Annexes 10-14 contain for each
WE for FY 1972-83 income and cash flow statements and balance sheets.
Annex 15 details the basis and assumptions for these statements. (Throughout,
Samarinda's fiscal years, which end on December 31, are one fiscal year
earlier than those designated for the other WE's, which end on March 31.
However, if a contemplated change in fiscal years is made to a December 31
basis for all WE's, certain commitments will be based on such fiscal years,
as hereinafter indicated.)



- 19 -
6.03      In view of the lack of records of historical costs and physical
data, the amount of fixed assets in the initial balance sheet of each WE,
as of March 31, 1972, was estimated by the consultants from available records
and physical inspections at replacement cost, less allowance for depreciation.
The WE's fixed assets are old, of uncertain age, and of small value in relation
to the property additions proposed.
6.04      The financial statements show that revenues under existing water
rate structures have exceeded cash operating expenses by only small margins
or have resulted in deficits when allowance is made for the depreciation of
fixed assets. Small cash surpluses provided by water supply operations have
been devoted largely to the general uses of the local governments despite
the pressing needs for improved and expanded water facilities. Any construc-
tion expenditures in recent years have been made largely from grants by the
National Government. This situation will be changed under the projects. The
statements show an improving picture for the future, due largely to water
rate increases assumed in the projections for FY 1977 and subsequent years
and the use of internally generated funds for construction purposes. These
are discussed below in connection with water rates.
Transfers of Assets to WE's
6.05      A WE is being established in each of the five cities to take over
the assets and liabilities and the functions of the unit of the municipal
or regency government in that city which relate to water supply (paras 3.16-
3.19), and the initial equity will be owned by the municipality or regency.
The WE, under the direction of its water board, will perform the water supply
functions in the city and will account separately for its operations and finances.
6.06      Management consultants will assist each WE in preparing opening
and periodic financial statements on a commercial accounting basis and in
establishing and maintaining proper accounting and management systems. They
will also assist in valuing and classifying the fixed assets for the opening
balance sheet.
Financing Plan
6.07      Projections of annual cash flow up to FY 1983 for the WE in each
of the five cities are shown in Annexes 10-B to 14-B. The financing plan
for each WE and combined for the five, for the project construction period
FY 1975-81, as summarized from the cash flow projections for those years,
is shown in the table below.

- 21 -
6.08      The combined figures shown for the five WE's in the financing
plan indicate that the proposed IBRD loan of US$12.3 million for the projects
in the five cities is expected to provide about 54% of the project costs and
51% of total capital requirements. Government loans would provide about 10%
of the project costs and total capital requirements. Internal cash gene-
ration from operations would provide about 19% of total capital requirements,
and 7% would be provided by consumer contributions for service connections.
While National Government equity payments are made during the project period
to the extent of about 33% of total capital reqvirements, about 21% of
total capital requirements is expected to be repaid to the Government by
the use of funds generated internally by the enterprises during the project
period.
6.09      Comparable figures are shown in the financing plan for each WE
individually. The proposed IBRD loan would provide amounts ranging from about
38% of project costs (35% of total capital requirements) for Jambi to 68% of
project costs (65% of total capital requirements) for Purwokerto. The IBRD
loan and Government loans together would provide 60% of the project costs
(56% of total capital requirements) for each WE, except that for Malang and
Purwokerto the percentages would be 70% and 67%, respectively. Internal cash
generation would provide almost 20% of total capital requirements of each WE,
except Banyuwangi for which it would provide about 29%. The balance of the
capital requirements would be provided by the Government net equity payments
and consumer contributions. The proposed financing plan for each WE is
satisfactory.
6.10      The financing plan is based on the terms agreed at negotiations.
The proceeds of the IBRD loan, together with other Government funds, will
be loaned by the Government to the WE's at an annual interest rate of 9%
and the loans will be repayable over 30 years, including a grace period of
six years for the payment of principal and interest, during which the inte-
rest will be waived. The Government will lend to each WE 60% of the project
costs and will make available as equity the remaining 40% of the project
costs, except that for Malang and Purwokerto such percentages will be 70%
and 30%, respectively. Any surplus amounts which the WE is able to generate
internally during the six-year grace period will be repaid annually to
reduce the Government's equity. The Government's waiver of interest on the
loans during the grace period will reduce the net equity payments which the
Government would otherwise be required to make if such interest were paid
in cash. The alternative of adding the interest to the principal of the
loans would require increases in the water rates beyond those indicated in
paras 6.16 to 6.20.
6.11      The estimates of project costs are based on the best information
available at this time. However, should there be increases in project costs,
the Government has agreed to provide any funds needed to complete the projects
on time. The Government has also agreed to ensure that the WE's have suffi-
cient funds to meet any of their obligations until 1981.



- 22 -
Financial Projections
6.12      The assumptions underlying the financial projections in Annexes
10-14 are detailed in Annex 15.
6.13      On the basis of the study of the organization of each WE made by
the management consultants, increases in the number of staff are forecast
over the project period to provide sufficient staff to implement the expan-
sion and improvement program. Increases in rates of compensation designed
to make them adequate under local conditions in each project area are also
projected. However, in one of the cities compensation is presently based
in part on a proportion of revenues. Since in the future considerable
increase in revenues is expected, agreement was reached during negotiations
that staff compensation of any WE will not be directly linked to the level
of its revenues.
6.14      There is no insurance coverage on the properties of the water
systems. Allowance has been made in the expense estimates for insurance
premiums for property coverage, based on percentages of the cost of equip-
ment and structures.  Agreement was reached during negotiations that
adequate provision will be made for insurance of the goods to be financed
from the proceeds of the IBRD loan and to cover the water supply operations
of the WE's consistent with appropriate practice.
6.15      The projected water production figures assume gradual reductions
in unaccounted-for water as new facilities are placed in service and leakage
detection measures are taken. The percentages for the individual WE's appear
in the statements of income (Annexes 10-A to 14-A). In view of the existence
in the water systems of defective meters and the lack of meters, the present
loss percentages are rough estimates. The projects include provisions for
bulk and customer meters, leakage detection equipment, meter repair shops,
replacements of old pipeline, and on-the-job training by the consultants
for a continuing program of leakage detection and repairs. Each WE will
establish a leakage detection and waste control unit with the primary respon-
sibility for detecting and repairing leaks and controlling waste and reporting
to management periodically on the progress made toward the goals established
in the projects for the reduction of unaccounted-for water.
Water Rates and Billings
6.16      The schedule of existing water rates and related charges of each
water system is shown in Annex 16. In most cases separate rates are specified
for residential service and other classes of service such as commercial,
industrial, government agencies and social and religious institutions. Rates
are usually lowest for residential service, except for those charged to
religious institutions, and the rates generally include a minimum charge and
are graduated upward for increased use in order to extend available supply

and reduce waste. The consultants have recommended a continuation and
extension of these principles in their study. (See para 6.21).
6.17      It is clear from the financial statements and projections that
sizeable rate increases will be required to enable the WE's to meet the needs
of their proposed financing plans. The question of reasonable and sustainable
future rate levels is one of the most difficult in view of the uncertainties
even as to existing demand, income patterns and capabilities of paying for
service. The problem is compounded in these cities by the availability
to much of the population of alternative, although unsafe, sources of water
from shallow wells and streams. However, the view was expressed by the
Government and local managements that substantial rate increases can be
sustained under a program of improved service, if introduced gradually over
the period of years assumed.
6.18      The existing water rates, which will be continued through FY 1976,
do little more than provide sufficient funds to pay current cash expenses
including minimum maintenance. The proposed increases are designed to
produce gradually the increased revenues needed to cover operating expenses
and modest contributions to the construction program and to generate by
FY 1982 sufficient funds to provide a 6% return on net fixed assets in service.
They will also suffice to meet the debt service requirements commencing in
that year. The projected increases are considered to be within the ability
of the consumers to pay, as the average monthly residential billings for
water would not exceed 4% of the estimated average household income. The
consultants estimated the household income in the areas in which residential
service is to be extended on the basis of interviews with district heads in
the five cities. The proposals would increase the average rates in FY 1977
for Malang by approximately 170%, Purwokerto 140%, Banyuwangi 80%, Jambi 15%,
and Samarinida 110%, with gradual increases each year thereafter. Before
rate increases can be implemented they require the authorization of the
municipal or regency assembly and are subject to confirmation by the governor
of the province.
6.19      The major part of existing and prospective demand is for residential
service, which is expected to increase to about 75% of total demand by 1981
as service is extended into additional residential areas. The average water
rates per m3 shown for each year in the income statements in Annexes 10-A
to 14-A are composite rates for all classes of service. The table below
summarizes the existing and projected average water rates for various years
for all classes of service and for residential service.

lThe fiscal years shown in the above table for Samarinda are 1976, 1977, 1979
and 1981, respectively.
6.20      The income statements in Annexes 10-A to 14-A show low rates of
return on net fixed assets despite the projected water rate increases,
building up to a 6% return in FY 1982.  For the reasons indicated in paras
6.17 and 6.18, these returns are considered acceptable. The Government has
agreed to take all measures required to ensure that the WE's will increase
average water rates at the beginning of each of the fiscal years 1977 and 1978
at least to the extent set forth in the income statements and will further
increase water rates thereafter to provide revenues sufficient to produce
rates of return on the value of net fixed assets in service (less consumer
contributions) of at least 1% in FY 1979; 2% in FY 1980; 4% in FY 1981; and
6% in FY 1982. All references to fiscal years relate to the year ending
Ifarch 31 (except for Samarinda). During negotiations, however, the Indonesian
officials indicated that the fiscal years of the WE's would probably be
changed to a calendar year basis. If this occurs all references to fiscal
years will relate to the preceding calendar year, e.g., FY 1977 will be
taken as the year ending December 31, 1976, and the loan documents have been
prepared on the assumption that this change will be made.
6.21      In addition to the agreement on the water rate increases summarized
in para 6.20, it was agreed by the Government that before September 30, 1975,
DSE, in consultation with the WE's, will assess the conclusions of the
consultant's national standard water rate study in relation to each WE and
will formulate recommendations which will be sent to IBRD. Thereafter the



- 25 -
Government will ensure the prompt implementation of such recommendations
as shall have been agreed with IBRD. The rate study deals with the structure
of water rates, e.g., differences in rates among various classes of consumrs
and for varying quantities of use, rather than levels of water rates to be
charged. It will serve as a guide for formulating water rate structures in
the municipalities which will participate in the national water supply program.
6.22      The cash collections of the water works from customers relative
to billings made to them for water service cannot be estimated closely
because the water works' records are not adequate to permit comparisons
of overall billings with collections for particular periods. Working meters
are read and bills are rendered and collected monthly. There is considerable
estimating of water use for billing purposes because of non-working meters
and the entire lack of meters in two of the cities.  Estimates of use may
be made on the basis of past metered use or on an assumed quantity for the
type of connection or for each person in the household. The estimated bills
may be subject to waiver or negotiations where there has been little or
no consumption because of interruptions in service.
6.23      Consumers in the municipalities accept the principle of paying for
piped water supply. From checking of customers' accounts, it appears that
payments of billings are made fairly promptly, collections are pursued
diligently, and the threat of cutting off service which is occasionally
required usually results in payment. The exception to this collection
experience are certain government institutions which often pay bills only
after delays of several years from the billing dates. These billings vary
from about 52 to 25% of total billings in the respective cities and average
about 15% of total billings, but these percentages will decline as residential
service is increased in the program. Early in 1973, such payments for the
previous five years were in arrears in two of the cities, and payments of
arrears had recently been made in the other three cities. The WE's must
receive prompt payments from government institutions as well as from others
in order to meet their obligations, including payments of debt service to
the Government.  Agreement was reached during negotiations that the Government
will pay promptly to the WE's all arrears for water supplied to Government
institutions and in the future will ensure that all amounts for services will
be paid promptly when due.
6.24      The program contemplates that lower-income areas in the cities
will be served by public standpipes. While about 35% of the total popu-
lation to be served by 1981 in the five cities will be served by standpipes,
the demand to be satisfied through standpipes is estimated at only about 4%
of total demand because of much lower per-capita consumption from standpipes.
The standpipes will be metered, and water works authorities contemplate that
water will be drawn for a consumer by the holder of a standpipe licence or
by an employee of the WE. However, the necessity of purchasing small enough



- 26 -
quantities of water for consumers to carry away and the profit element in
the licence holder's charges would not permit charges to be made at lowest
scheduled rates and could result in excessive charges to the users. A more
equitable and practical arrangement to serve the poorer population needs
to be followed. To achieve this, agreement was reached during negotiations
that either the municipality or regency will pay for the consumption metered
through standpipes, or the amounts will be collected from the people of
the neighborhood by the Rukun Tetangga (the neighborhood organization) on
a monthly or quarterly basis using charges at the lowest residential rates.
6.25      In addition to the annual charges, residential consumers will be
charged the initial cost of new service connections. So that they will be
able to afford the connections, residential applicants will be permitted
to pay about one-sixth of the cost upon installation and the balance in
equal monthly installments over five years. The outlays by the WE's for the
service connections have been included in the estimated costs of the projects.
Future Finances
6.26      On the basis of the financial projections, the WE's will generate
sufficient cash to finance about 20% of the construction program and to
provide working capital and some additional cash funds at the end of the
project period. lhese funds will provide a cushion if projections should
fall short of expectations, or they could be devoted to extensions of service
beyond the first stage.
6.27      The projections show that the debt of the WE's will be relatively
high, ranging for the individual WE's from approximately 50% to 90%, and
averaging about 66%, of combined debt and equity in FY 1982. Debt service
coverage would range from about 1.2 to 2.0 and average 1.5 in FY 1982 with
the commencement of full debt amortization.
6.28      In viewing the future finances, the basis for the Government's
decision on a program of financing water supply projects primarily by loans
rather than to a large extent by net equity investments should be noted.
This decision was based on consideration of the benefits to the Government's
development program of the ultimate repayment of the loans to facilitate
the financing of other essential needs in Indonesia, including the pressing
needs of other cities for water supply. It was also influenced by the
desirability of preserving in the local governments an equity ownership in
the water works and the primary responsibility for their success. These
considerations are important to the development of a successful program in
Indonesia. There is reasonable prospect for gradual improvement in the
finances of the WE's with the measures to be taken under the program. During
the project period the performance of each WE will be monitored, and the
performance indicators to be reviewed will include those set forth in Annex 17.

6.29      With regard to any indebtedness which might be proposed by a WE
other than under the projects, agreement was reached during negotiations
that no WE will incur debts without the consent of IBRD unless net income
before interest and depreciation is at least 1.5 times the maximum debt
service in any future year.
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
7.01      During negotiations, agreement was reached on the following
principal points:
(a) the reorganization of DSE and the introduction of proposed
working procedures will be implemented and additional staff
will be recruited according to agreed time schedules (para
3.07);
(b) with respect to the reorganization of the water undertakings
(i) each municipality or regency will transfer to the appro-
priate WE the water works and all assets used in its operations,
including all receivables and accrued assets and a sufficient
amount of working capital to enable it to continue its opera-
tions, and (ii) each WE will enter into a project loan
agreement, acceptable to IBRD, with the National Government
for the completion of the related project (para 3.18);
(c) the relending terms of IBRD funds and lending terms for the
Government financing will be as assumed in the Financing
Plan (para 6.10);
(d) the WE's will apply annually internally generated cash to
effect the reductions of the equity investments made by
the National Government to meet project costs (para 6.10);
(e) the WE's will increase average water rates at the beginning
of each of the fiscal years 1977 and 1978 at least to the
extent set forth in the income statements and will further
increase water rates thereafter to provide revenues suffi-
cient to produce rates of return on the value of net fixed
assets in service (less consumer contributions) of at least
1% in FY 1979, 2% in FY 1980, 4% in FY 1981, and 6% in
FY 1982 (para 6.20); and
(f) before September 30, 1975, DSE, in consultation with the WE's,
will assess the recommendations of the national standard water
rate study, formulate recommendations and submit the findings
to IBRD. Thereafter the Government will ensure the prompt



- 28 -
implementation of such recommendations as shall have
been mutually agreed upon (para 6.21).
7.02      During negotiations it was agreed that before the loan becomes
effective all the project loan agreements and the contract for the con-
sultant services for management and technical assistance wtll be signed
(paras 3.18 and 3.20).
7.03      The project is suitable for an IBRD loan of US$14.5 million for
a term of 30 years, including a grace period of 6 years.

FIVE CITIES WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS
Descriptions of Existing Water Supply Systems
1.        General data and existing water supply systems for each of the
five cities are described below in Sections 2 to 6 and shown on Maps IBRD
10871-10875.
2. MALANG (Map IBRD 10871)
2.01      Malang is located in the central part of the province of East
Java, longitude 112° 38' east and latitude 7° 59' south of the equator.
The Municipality of Malang is administratively autonomous with its own
local government and it is also the center of the government of the Regency
of Malang. The economy of the municipality is primarily based on Agri-
cultural production from small and estate farms and small scale industries.
The present population is about 422,000 of which 30% is supplied from the
water works system.
2.02      The water sources are the springs of Binangun and Karangan, located
17 and 12 km from the city, from where the water gravitates to the storage
tanks at Dinoyo and Betek and to the service area. The water is of good
quality. The springs have a safe yield of 310 l/s, but only 262 l/s (22,637
m3/day) reaches the service area because of overflow waste at the springs
and consumption and leakage along the pipeline routes. The water supply is
insufficient and intermittent. 3The two storage tanks, Dinoyo and Betek,
each with a capacity of 2,000 mi, supply from different elevations two
separated pressure zones in the service area. The total storage volume,
4,000 m3, represents 18% of the daily water supply.
2.03      The transmission mains have a total length of about 42.5 km in
sizes from 0 200 to 0 350 mm. Primary and secondary mains in the dis-
tribution system have a total length of about 134 km in sizes from 0 50 mm
to 0 300 mm. The distribution system is provided with' 24 standpipes,
183 fire hydrants, and about 13,000 service connections, and it covers
a service area of 1,440 hectares.
3.   PURWOKERTO (Map IBRD 10872)
3.01      Purwokerto is located in the southwestern part of Central Java,
longitude 1090 15' east and latitude 7° 25' south of the equator. Purwokerto
is a subdistrict of and an administrative center for the Banyumas Regency.
It is a commercial city with major railway facilities and good road connec-
tions. The present population is about 211,000 and approximately 32 is



ANNEX 2
Page 2
supplied from the water works system.  The service area covers Sukaraja and
Kalibagor in addition to Purwokerto.
3.02      The water source is the Kawung Carang Spring, located about
6 km north of the city, from where the water gravitates to the storage
tank and3to the service area. The safe yield of the spring is 81 l/s
(7,000 m /day). The water is corrosive and for treatment it passes
through beds of marble chips. The intake works and treatment facilities
have recently been extended to accommodate the total source capacity.
3.03      A new storage tank with a volume of 1,000 m3 has recently been
completed as well as a new transmission main 0 350 mm, length 3,600 m,
between the spring and the storage tank. The water flow reaching the
storage tank is 81 l/s while the capacity of the distribution system
is limited to 25 ls, with the difference overflowing at the storage tank.
3.04      The transmission mains have a total length of about 22.4 km in
sizes from 0 100 to 0 350 mm. Primary and secondary mains in the dis-
tribution system have a total length of about 22.0 km in sizes from 0 50
to 0150 mm. The distribution system has about 1,300 service connections
and covers a service area of about 340 hectares.
4.   BANYUWANGI (Map IBRD 10873)
4.01      Banyuwangi is located in the southwestern part of the province
of Central Java, longtitude 114° 20' east and latitude 8° 10' south of
the equator. Banyuwangi is a subdistrict of and an administrative center
for the Banyuwangi Regency. Banyuwangi is a seaport at the Bali Strait,
and new port facilities for accommodating bigger vessels are under con-
struction 9 km from the city. Business establishments in the city are
paper, coconut oil and fish canning factories. The present population
is about 78,000 and approximately 6% of the population is supplied from
the water works system.
4.02      The water source is the Gedor Spring, from where the water
gravitates to the storage tanks at Penataban and Bojolangu and to the
distribution system. The water quality is good and only chlorination is
required. The safe yield of the spring is 110.5 I/s of which 100.4 I/E;
(8,675 m3/day) is conveyed in two transmission mains, one old 0 125 mm
and one recently completed 0 250 mm, to a break pressure tank at Bojolangu,
elevation + 80 m and capacity 30 i3, and to storage tanks at Penataban,
elevation + 50 m and capacity 1,400 m. The break pressure tank and the
storage tanks supply a high and a low zone in the service area. At
Penataban an old storage tank, 500 m3, has recently been supplemented
with a new tank, 900 mg.
4.03      The water flow reaching the break pressure and storage tanks
is 100.4 1/s while the capacity of the distribution system is limited
to 27.4 l/s with the difference overflowing at the storage tanks. The



ANNEX 2
Page 3
3
storage capacity 1,400 m corresponds to 60% of the present daily con-
sumption and is quite adequate. The transmission mains and the primary
and secondary mains in the distribution system have a total length of
about 41.8 km in sizes from 0 50 to 0 250 mm. The distribution system
has about 1,300 service connections.
5.   JAMBI (Map IBRD 10874)
5.01      Jambi is located on Sumatera in the Province of Jambi, longitude
1030 25' east and latitude 10 40' south of the equator. The Municipality
of Jambi is administratively autonomous with its own local government
and it is also the center for the province. The economy of Jambi is
mainly dependent on its harbor, where most of the products coming from
and going to Middle Sumatera are loaded and unloaded. The present popula-
tion is about 166,000 and approximately 3% is supplied from the water works
system.
5.02      The water source is the Batang Hari River.  The water is colored,
polluted, and contains high turbidity so that full treatment is required.
There are two existing intakes, one pumps directly to a separated part of
the distribution system, which presents a constant health hazard, and the
other pumps to the treatment works.
5.03      The treatment works are about 40 years old and provide for chemical
flocculation, sedimentation3and rapid sand filtration, with a production
capacity of 10.5 Ils (907 m /day). The various components are: (i) 2 primary
circular settling tanks, total volume 777 m3, detention time 28 hours;
(ii) flocculation channel, volume 18.3 m3, detention time 0.7 hours; (iii) 2
circular settling tanks, total volume 174 m3, surface area 58 m2, detention
time 6.5 hours, settling rate 0.5 m/h; (iv) 4 sand filters, surface area
24 m2, filter rate 1.1 m/h; (v) 2 clear wells, total volume3336 m3, detention
time 12 hours; and (vi) elevated storage tank, volume 294 m , detention time
11 hours. The raw water is pumped to the primary settling tanks, frotn where
it is boosted to the flocculation channel and gravitates through the settling
and filter tanks to the clear wells. From the clear wells the water is
boosted to the elevated tank, which is located within the treatment works
compound, for gravity distribution to the service area. The treatment
works are in poor condition and the operation and maintenance are
deficient.
5.04      The distribution system is subdivided into two separated zones,
one serving treated water and one raw water. The system serves mainly
the central area of the city, and it has about 1,500 service connections,
none of which are metered.
5.05      The immediate improvement program, currently under way, includes
the following works: (i) new intake pumping station; (ii) replacement
of existing raw water main; (iii) rehabilitation of the treatment works
and certain parts of the distribution system; and (iv) drilling of a



ANNEX 2
Page 4
borehole. The borehole is expected to increase the water supply by 3 1/s
(260 m3/day) and it will serve the provincial government area. The new
intake and proposed rehabilitation works are 3projected to increase the
total production capacity to 29 1/s (2,500 m /day) by FY 1976.
6.   SAMARINDA (Map IBRD 10875)
6.01      Samarinda is located in the eastern part of Kalimantan, longitude
1170 0' east and latitude 0° 30' south of the equator. The Municipality of
Samarinda is administratively autonomous with its own local government.
Samarinda's economy is based on its harbor and its position as timber center
for the province.  The present population is about 106,000 and approximately
14% is supplied from the water works system.
6.02      The water source is the Mahakam River.  The water is colored,
polluted and contains high turbidity so that full treatment is required.
There are two intakes but only one (Teluk Lerong) is in operation. The
intake pumps for pumping to the treatment works will be replaced with new
pumps in 1974 in order to cope with the increased treatment capacity. A
new raw water main, 0 250 mm, has recently been laid, but it has yet to be
commissioned.
6.03      The old treatment works were constructed in 1932, and at the
same site new treatment works are currently under construction, scheduled
for completion in 1974. The old treatment works with a capacity of 10.6 1/s
(916 m3/day) consist of: (i) 2 primary settling basins, total volume 800 n3,
detention time 22 hours; (ii) dosing and flocculation tanks; (iii) 2 vertical
flow settling tanks, total volume 130 m3, detention time 3.2 hours; (iv) 3
rapid sand filters, total area 12 n2, filtration rate 3 m/h; and (v) clearwell,
capacity 360 mr, detention time 9.4 hours. From the clearwell the water
gravitates to the distribution system except for a small portion (2.2 l/s)
that is boosted to Hotel Lamin Indah. The water supply is insufficient and
intermittent.
6.04      The treatment works under construction are designed for a capacity
of 50 1/s (4,320 m3/day) and consist of: (i) existing 2 primarX settling
basins also be to be used for the new plant, total volume 8003nP, detention
time 5.5 hours at 60 l/s; (ii) flocculation tank, volume 47 m , det Intion
time 0.2 hours; (iii) 2 tube-type settling tanks, total volume 31 m and
area 23.5 m2, detention time 0.2 hours, settling rate 7.6 m/h; (iv) 5 rapid
sand filter tanks, total area 37.5 m2, filtration rate 4.8 m/h; and (v) a
clear well, capacity 987.5 m3, detention time 5.5 hours. The tube settling
tanks are yet untested in Indonesia and the detention time might be too low
and the settling rate too high. The design of the filter tanks requires
modifications, and flow regulating devices have to be added. The treatment
works are assumed to be in operation in 1975 but due to the above uncer-
tainties the capacity is assumed to be limited to 25 1/s (2,160 m 3/day).
With completion of the new treatment works the total production capacity will3
be increased to 35 lls (3,020 m3/day) and the clearwell capacity to 1,347.5 m

FIVE CITIES WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS
Description of the Projects
1.   GENERAL
1.01      The master plan covers a period through 2001 and it has been
subdivided into two phases, Phase I (1975-1986) and Phase II (1987-2001).
The phases have been subdivided into stages, which for Phase I are Stage I
(1975-1981) and Stage II (1982-1986). The five cities water supply projects
comprise extension of Stage I water supply facilities and related consultant
services. The various water supply components for each of the five cities
are described below in sections 2 to 6 and shown on Maps IBRD 10871 to 10875.
1.02      The designs of the water works are based on population and water
demand projections shown in Annexes 8-A and B. For the water works compo-
nents the following design criteria have been applied. Water production
facilities are designed for maximum day demand and distribution systems
for peak hour supply. Intake structures for surface water (Jambi and
Samarinda) and submarine main (Samarinda) are designed for the master plan
period due to their complexity. Production facilities such as treatment
works, clear wells and transmission mains are designed for 1986 except in
Malang where present allocation from the Mendit spring is sufficient only
up to 1983. The extensions of the distribution systems are designed for
the projected water demand in 1981, but individual distribution mains are
designed for a water demand beyond 1981 where appropriate. Balancing
storage tanks and pumping plants are generally designed for the require-
ments in 1986.
2.   MALANG (Map IBRD 10871)
2.01      The water supply from existing spring sources, Binangun and
Karangan (262 l/s), can only be increased by adding water currently
overflowing, which is insignificant. The Sumber Sari Spring with an
available yield of about 29 l/s could, after installation of equipment
for chlorination, be reconnected to the city water supply system.
However, that would require certain reinforcement of the transmission
mains which is not economically justified at the present stage. Alter-
natives of groundwater and the Mendit Spring have been studied as
sources of additional water.
2.02      A soil resistivity survey has indicated a groundwater potential
more remote from the city area than was preliminarily assumed. The Mendit
Spring, located about 5 km from the city has a safe yield of 2 to 3 m3/s.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
The Spring was initially authorized for use for recreational purposes only,
but the Directorate of Water Resources has recently allocated 500 l/s of
its yield to the city water supply. After analysis of the two alternatives
the Mendit Spring has proved to be the least cost solution.
2.03      With the development of the Mendit Spring, the distribution
system will be served from two directions, The present water supply from
Binangun and Karangan will feed the upper zone of the distribution system,
while the Mendit Spring, due to its lower elevation and pumping requirements,
will feed the lower zone. Binangun and Karangan cannot, however, satisfy
the projected water demand in the upper zone, and boosting from the lower
zone will be needed.
2.04      The available yield from all the springs, 762 Ils, corresponds
to the projected maximum day demand in 1983. For the water source devel-
opment in Stage II, groundwater versus additional extension of the Mendit
Spring will be evaluated, if the Directorate of Water Resources agrees to
increase the allocation from the Mendit Spring to the city water supply.
A test well drilling program will be carried out in Stage I to ascertain
the availability of groundwater as to quantity and quality. The Mendit
Spring water is corrosive and treatment by aeration is required.
2.05      The following components are included in the Stage I project:
(a) Water works at the Mendit Spring comprising intake
structure with collection chamber; pumping station
for boosting to the aeration chamber, four pumps
to be installed, each with a capacity of 170 1/s;
aeration chamber; clear well; amd pumping station
for boosting to the low zone of the distribution
system with pumps as above;
(b)  transmission main 0 700 mm, length about 5,200 m;
(c) pumping station with three pumps, each with the
capacity of about 120 1/s, for boosting from the
low to the high zone;
(d) a 2,000 m3 capacity storage tank for the high zone;
(e) distribution system with service connections and
water meters; and
(f) miscellaneous such as motor vehicles, public bath-
houses, warehouses, maintenance shop, laboratory
building, staff houses, and test well drilling for
Stage II water source development.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
The water supply capacity will be increased from 262 1/s to 762 1/s
and the distribution capacity to 755 1/s. Stage I will increase the
percentage of the population served by connections from 23% to 42% and
by standpipes from 7% to 12%.
2.06      Balancing storage capacity required in 1986 is 10,000 m3
representing about 12% of the projected maximum day demand. The storage
needed for the high zone is about 6,000 m3 and for the low zone 4,000 m3.
Additional storage of 2,000 m3 is needed for the high zone in Stage I,
while extension of the storage capacity for the low zone can be deferred
to Stage II.
2.07      The Stage I project includes about 52.3 km of distribution mains
in sizes varying from 75 to 500 mm diameters. Actual sizes an4 lengths of
mains will be decided during detailed design. The distribution system will
provide for 28 new or rehabilitated public bath houses, 89 additional
standpipes and 50 fire hydrants, and the number of service connections
will increase from about 13,000 to 26,000.
3.   PURWOKERTO (Map IBRD 10872)
3.01      The present water source, the Kawung Carang Spring, will be
supplemented in the Stage I project to meet the projected water demand.
A soil resistivity survey indicated the availability of groundwater and
the quantity and quality has recently been confirmed by drilling and pumping
tests. Two additional boreholes will be added in Stage I.
3.02      Water will be supplied from two sources, the boreholes and the
spring. The spring water gravitates to the distribution system while the
groundwater will need pumping. The spring source will be used to its maximum
capacity and supplemented with groundwater as water demand increases. The
groundwater will be pumped to the existing storage tank, and if treatment
is needed it will be provided near the storage tank.
3.03      The following components are included in the Stage I project:
(a)  Two boreholes;
(b)  pumping equipment for the new boreholes and the test
well, each with an expected capacity of 25 l/s;
(c)  transmission mains from boreholes to the storage tank
and to the distribution system;
(d)  treatment works, if needed, for the groundwater;
(e)  distribution system with service connections and
water meters; and



ANNEX 4
Page 4
(f) miscellaneous such as motor vehicles, laboratory
equipment and meter test bench, public bathhouses,
water works office, laboratory, warehouses, and staff
houses.
With the completion of the Stage I project the production capacity will
increase from 81 l/s to 156 1/s (13,500 m3/day) and the distribution
system capacity from 25 1/s to 196 l/s. Stage I will increase the
percentage of the population served by connections from 3% to 17% and
by standpipes from 0% to 18%.
3.04      Required balancing storage is 2,500 m3 in 1986 and 1,400 m3 in
1981, which corresponds 3to about 12% of the related maximum day demand.
Present storage 1,000 m will be too small at the end of the Stage I
period, but it is assumed to be offset by expected excess capacity from
the boreholes.
3.05      The Stage I project includes about 36.6 km of transmission and
distribution mains in sizes varying from 75 mm to 450 mm diameter. Actual
sizes and lengths of mains will be decided during detailed design. The
distribution system will provide for 3 public bathhouses, 54 standpipes and
80 fire hydrants, and the number of service connections will increase from
about 1,300 to 7,400.
4.   BNVYUWANGI (Map IBRD 10873)
4.01      The yield of the existing Gedor Spring, will be sufficient to
meet the projected water demand beyond 1990. Any extension of the water
production facilities will not be needed prior to Phase II. The Stage
I project will provide for additional distribution capacity and for improved
water pressure in the high zone of the service area by the construction of
a new break pressure tank.
4.02      The following components are included in the Stage I project:
(a)  break pressure tank 200 m3 with chlorination plant;
(b)  transmission mains, 0 250 mm, length 2,100 m;
(c) distribution system with service connections and
water meters; and
(d) miscellaneous such as motor vehicles, laboratory
equipment and meter test bench, public bathhouses,
laboratory, warehouses, and st-aff housing.
With completion of the Stage I project the distribution system capacity
will be increased from 24.7 1/s to 61.3 l/s with a corresponding increase
in the percentage of the population served by connections from 6% to 10%
and by standpipes from 0% to 21%.



ANNEX 4
Page 5
4.03      The high zone in the service area will be supplied from the break
pressure tank. The high zone will not need any balancing storage since
the total spring water supply passes the break pressure tank and exceeds
the high zone peak hour demand. The storage tanks for the low zone will
instead function as balancinf storage for the total service area and their
existing capacity of 1,600 m would be adequate beyond 1990.
4.04      The Stage I project includes about 16.A4 km of distribution mains
in sizes varying from 50 mm to 250 mm diameter. Actual sizes and lengths
of mains will be decided during detailed design. The distribution system
will provide for 4 public bathhouses, 25 standpipes and 65 fire hydrants,
and the number of service connections will increase from about 1,300 to 2,200.
5.   JAMBI (Map IBRD 10874)
5.01      A preliminary hydrogeological survey has indicated that ground-
water development for the projected water demand is not feasible, and there-
fore the Batang Hari River will remain the water source. Existing sites for
intake and treatment works are not suitable for extensions, and new sites
for the Stage I project have been selected. Materials and equipment for an
intake, pumping station and treatment works, which were purchased in 1970
at a cost of about US$380,000, will be incorporated in the project but there
will be no disbursement from the loan against these costs. The elevated
tank at the site of the existing treatment works will be supplemented with
a new elevated tank, since the old one does not provide sufficient pressure
in the distribution system or adequate balancing capacity. After completion
of the Stage I Project the distribution system will be separated into two
zones to be supplied from the existing and the proposed production facilities.
The settlements on the north side of the Batang Hari River will be supplied
by groundwater, and related development works will be executed by Cipta Karya
as a separate project.
5.02      The following components are included in the Stage I project:
(a)  raw water intake with pumping station, three pumps
to be installed each with a capacity of 135 l/s;
(b)  raw water transmission main 0 450 mm, length 1,000 m;
(c)  treatment works, capacity 270 l/s, including clear
well and booster pumping station;
(d)  distribution system with service connections and
water meters;
(e)  elevated storage tank, capacity 1,000 m 3; and
(f)  miscellaneous such as motor vehicles, public bath-
houses, warehouses, maintenance shop, water works
office, laboratory building and staff housing.



ANNEX 4
Page 6
The capacity of the existing works including those in the immediate improve-
ment program is 29 l/s (2,500 m3/day).  With completion of the Stage I  3
project the total production capacity will increase to 299 1/s (25,900 m /day)
and the distribution capacity to 230 1/s (19,800 m3/day). The Stage I
project will increase the percentage of population served, compared to 1976,
by connections from 3% to 37% and decrease the population served by stand-
pipes from 33% to 25%.
5.03      The new intake will be located further upstream than the existing
one.  The site is upstream from present industrial and residential settle-
ments and is suitable for construction, but is located on an island with-
out any land access. The construction of the intake is not expected to
be significantly hampered by the lack of land access, and the water
separating the island fron the mainland is narrow and shallow during the
dry season, which should hot provide any difficulties for crossing of a
raw water main.
5.04      The treatment works will provide for chemical flocculation,
sedimentation and rapid sand filtration, and the various components are:
(a)  two circular clariflocculators with compartments
for flocculation and settling and with mechanical
equipment for stirring and scraping;
(b)  three rapid sand filters for a filtration rate of
about 5 m/h;
3
(c) clear well, capacity 3,000 m3
(d)  booster pumping station with 3 pumps, one of which
is standby, each with a capacity of 135 1/, and
1 smaller pump with a capacity of 50 l/s; and
(e)  buildings for chemical handling and administration,
and yard piping.
Alum will be used for flocculation, lime for pH adjustment, and chlorine or
calcium hypochloride for disinfection.
3
5.05      Balancing storage capacity to be required in 1986 is 4,000 m3
Existing elevated storage tank has a capacity of only 294 m3. Additional
storage is needed for convenient operation of the system and, because of
the terrain conditions, the tank will be elevated at a location to be decided
upon during the detailed design. An elevated tank represents a considerable
cost, and since the site for treatment works and clear well is within the
service area the clear well could feasibly contain a part of the balancing
storage. To facilitate operation during hours of low consumption, the pumping
equipment presently in store will be supplemented with one smaller pump with
a capacity of 50 l/s.



ANNEX 4
Page 7
5.06      The Stage I Project includes about 64.4 km of distribution mains
in sizes varying from 50 mm to 400 mm diameter. Actual sizes and lengths
of mains will be decided during detailed design. The distribution system
will provide for 3 public bathhouses, 18 additional standpipes and 130 fire
hydrants, and the number of service connections will increase from about
1,500 to 10,800.
6.   SAMARINDA (Map IBRD 10875)
6.01      A preliminary hydrogeological survey has indicated that ground-
water development for the projected water demand is not feasible, and
therefore the Mahakam River will remain the water source. Existing sites
for intake and treatment works are not suitable for extensiAns, and new
sites for the Stage I project have been selected. In the present system
the raw water is pumped to the treatment works located on a hill, and
after treatment and collection in a clear well the water gravitates to
the service area. In the Stage I project the treated water will be
boosted to the distribution system and the existing clear well. A sub-
marine pipeline will cross the Mahakam River to supply the southern side,
which is expected to become a developing area because of a nw road con-
nection with Balikpapan.
6.02      The following components are included in the Stage I project:
(a) raw water intake with pumping station with installa-
tion of three new pumps each with a capacity of 80 I/s,
and of two pumps to be removed from the existing intake;
(b)  raw water transmission mains, 0 300 -m, length ;800 m,
and 0 250 mm, length 750 m;
(c) treatment works with a capacity of 157 1/s, including
clear well and booster pumping station;
(d) transmission and distribution mains with service
connections and water meters; and
(e) miscellaneous including motor vehicles, public bath-
houses, warehouse, maintenance shop, laboratory
building and staff houses.
The capacity of existing water works and those under extension have been
assumed to be 35 1/s (3,024 m3/day). With completion of the Stage I
project the water production capacity will be increased to 192 l/s
(16,589 m3/day) and the distribution capacity to 134 1/s (11,578 m3/day).
The Stage I project will increase the percentage of population served,
compared to 1976, by connections from 7% to 21% and by standpipes :from 8%
to 17%.



LNNEX 4
Page 8
6.03      The new intake is proposed to be located upstream from the exist-
ing one and also upstream from the oil harbor, but it will still be located
in a congested area with polluted river water. Preferably the intake site
should be moved another 6.0 km upstream to avoid interference with resi-
dential settlements and harbor and industrial activities, but under the
circumstances the additional investment costs would not offset the possible
inconvenience of the chosen site. The pumping station will accommodate,
apart from three new pumps, two pumps to be removed from the existing intake
to be abandoned subsequently.
6.04      The treatment works will provide for chemical flocculation,
sedimentation and rapid sand filtration, and the various components are:
(a) two flocculation and sedimentation tanks;
(b) three rapid sand filters for a filtration rate
of about 5 m/h;
(c)  clear well, capacity 1,500 m 3
(d) booster pumping station with three pumps each with
a capacity of 30 I/s; and
(e) buildings for chemical handling and administration,
and yard piping.
Alum will be used for flocculation, lime for pH adjustment and chlorine or
calcium hypochloride for disinfection.
6.05      For flocculation and settling tanks, tenders will be invited
for mechanical and electrical equipment and the tenders will be evaluated
considering offered equipment and estimated costs for related civil works.
Accordingly, the civil works construction will be adapted to suit selected
equipment. Rapid sand filters with dual media are proposed for filtration.
3
6.06   3  Balancing storage capacity required in 1986 is 1,750 m , of which
1,200 m is existing. Additional storage in the distribution system, will
not be needed in Stage I.
6.07      The Stage I project includes about 37.2 km of distribution mains
in sizes varying from 75 mm to 400 mm diameter. Actual sizes and lengths
of mains will be decided during detailed design. The distribution syst2a
will provide for 2 public bathhouses, 10 additional standpipes and 70 fire
hydrants. The number of service connections will increase from about 1,000
to 3,500.

1.        Population Projections
1.01      For the population in Indonesia and its main islands, the Govern-
ment's Central Bureau of Statistics, Jakarta, has provided information on
actual and projected growth rates for the years 1961-1971 and 1972-1981.
The actual and projected average annual population growth rates are shown
in the table below.

Other islands                             2.02         2.53
1.02      For the population in the five cities and their provinces, sources
of information on actual and projected growth rates were the Government's
Central Bureau of Statistics, the provincial and local governments, urban
development plans, where available, and a Regional Transport Survey con-
ducted by the Asian Development Bank. The consultant has made three sets
of projections for the population growth of each of the five cities, as de-
scribed below.
(a)  Low series - The projections are based on the
historical relationship (1961-1971) between the
changes in the population in the city and in its
province, i.e., the city would maintain the same
percentage of the increases in population of its
province as it did historically.
(b)  High series - The projections are based on the
assumption that the population in the city in
relation to the population in its province would
increase faster than in the past. The increase



ANNEX 8-A
Page   2
reflects the growth potential of the city based
on present trends, improvement of communication
facilities, and expected industrial development.
(c) Medium series - The projections are the arithmetic
mean of the low and high series.
1.03      The table shows the projected average annual population growth
rates for each city and its province for the period 1972-1981.

/a   Indicates the selected growth rate.
The consultant has, in agreement with the local and national governments,
selected the growth rates indicated above for purposes of the water
demand projections.  The growth rates are assumed to follow the same
pattern for the whole master plan period. Annex 8-B shows for the study
area in each city the projected population during the master plan period,
and it also shows the projected population in numbers and percentages
to be served by service connections and standpipes.
2.        Water Demand Projietions
2.01      The consultant experienced difficulties in establishing reliable
data for past and present water consumption in the five cities, due to
insufficient and intermittent water supply, lack of water meters (Jambi



ANNEX 8-A
Page 3
and Samarinda), water meters out of order or inaccurate, and incomplete
records. The study of existing records has been supplemented by field
surveys which have covered relevant consumer classifications. For the
field surveys a representative number of connections with working water
meters and continuous water supply have been selected, and the results
have given an indication of the average water consumption for the various
consumer classifications. In cities without water meters the estimated
consumption has been based on production, number of connections, number
of people per household, and comparable data from other cities. The
estimates of water consumption for people who are not connected to the
water supply system have been based on collected data as to daily quanti-
ties of water purchased by vendors or hauled from dug wells or other water
sources.
2.02      Annex 8-B shows projected residential consumption in liters per
capita per day (1/cd) for service connections and standpipes, average day
consumption for various consumer classifications, unaccounted-for water,
maximum day production and peak hour demand. Projected residential con-
sumption in 1/cd for service connections varies from city to city and has
been based on such factors as existing estimated consumption, availability
of alternative water sources from dug wells, and the ability of the customers
to sustain the water rates. The 1/cd consumption from standpipes projected
in the feasibility reports varies for the cities, but since the variations
could not be justified, the consumption is assumed to be the same in the
five cities. For each of the other consumer classifications the unit demand
has been studied and the projected daily consumption has been based on con-
siderations of existing and future industrial, commercial and related activi-
ties, including a survey of each type of consumer carried out in each city.
In the feasibility studies, unaccounted-for water as a percentage of the
water production varies from city to city but in view of the uncertainties
it has been proposed to apply uniformly 30% for FY 1975 and 1976, 25% for
1977 and 1978 and 20% for the succeeding years. The decrease to 25% in
1977 should reflect the initial results from ongoing rehabilitation and
leak detection works.
2.03      Maximum day consumption and peak hour supply are the basebs for
the design of the water production facilities and the distribution system,
respectively.  The factors applied for computing maximum day consuwption
(Max. day: average day) and peak hour supply (peak hour: average hour)
have been arrived at from field studies for Cirebon (to be included in
the Swiss project). These factors were then adjusted to the particular
conditions in each of the five cities, considering the variations in
the consumption pattern and the relationship between different consumer
classifications such as industrial and commercial versus residential.

FIVE CITIES WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS
Assumptions for Estimatin the Internal Financial Rates of Return
1.        The rate of return calculations take as benefits the incremental
revenues earned by the projects and the consumer contributions for service
connections. They take as costs the project costs and the incremental
operating expenses net of depreciation and not including taxes. Benefits
and costs are taken at 1973 price levels with the exceptions noted below
to increase water rates and staff compensation rates net of the annual
inflation factor (Annex 15, para 8), which is excluded.
2.        The following assumptions have been made in the calculations
shown on page 1 of this Annex:
(a) Incremental revenues are based on the projections in
Annexes 10-A to 14-A and are the additional revenues
resulting from the projects taken at the projected
increases in water rates after discounting such rates
by the inflation factor applicable to the years in
which the increases are effective.
(b) Incremental operating expenses are based on the pro-
jections in Annexes 10-A to 14-A and are the addi-
tional expenses resulting from the project, excluding
the inflation factor. They include the projected in-
creases in rates of compensation made to upgrade the
staffs of the water enterprises, to the extent such
increases exceed the annual inflation factor.
(c) Consumer contributions for service connections are
based on the projections in Annexes 10-B to 14-B,
reduced to 1973 prices by the elimination from con-
nection costs of the allowance for price contingencies.
(d) The project costs are as shown in Annex 5, less price
contingencies.
3.        The rate of return for each water enterprise on the basis of the
above assumptions is set forth on Page 1 of this Annex opposite its name.
These approximate returns are: Malang 0.4%; Purwokerto 4.4%; Banyuwangi
1.3%; Jambi 6.9%; and Samarinda 3.5%.
4.        A significant factor in the low rates of return under the above
assumptions is the generally low level of existing water rates and the



ANNEX 9
Page 3
substantial discounting of the projected increased water rates by the
annual compounded inflation factor.
5.        Tests of the sensitivity of the rates of return to variations in
the project cost and operating expense show that a 10% increase or decrease
in the project cost would lower or raise the returns by percentages which
are within a range of plus or minus 0.7% to 1.0%. A 10% increase or decrease
in operating expense would lower or raise the returns by percentages which
are within a range of plus or minus 0.2% to 0.5%.

FIVE CITIES WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS
Assumptions for Financial Projections
General
1.        The financial statements in this report cover the water supply
operations in. each of the five cities in Annexes 10 through 14. These
annexes are each divided into part A - income statements, B - cash flow
statements, and C - balance sheets. The accounts of the water supply
units have generally been parts of the municipal or regency systems and
have been kept on a cash receipts and disbursements basis. They do not
account for such items as receivables, payables, inventories, fixed assets
or depreciation, and reliable information to supplement them is for the
most part lacking. The annex statements for the first three fiscal years
have therefore been derived or estimated on a cash receipts and disburse-
ment basis, using actual statements available for the first fiscal year or
years, as indicated below. The statements for the succeeding fiscal years
have been projected on an accrual accounting basis.
Income Statements
2.        The income statements for the first one or two fiscal years, as
denoted by the column heading "Actual/Estimate", are based on statements
of actual cash receipts and disbursements prepared by the WE or munici-
pality. The revenues and expenses in the income statements are the cash
receipts and disbursements, respectively, and an allowance for depreciation
has been included (para 13). The other data on water production, water
sales, connections, and average water rates are estimated, and the omis-
sion of a figure indicates that there is insufficient basis for an esti-
mate.
3.        Water production for each WE is based on the lower of the pro-
jected water demand rates of the population to be served or the projected
production capacity of the WE.
4.        Unaccounted-for water is projected to decrease from existing
levels to about 30% of water production in fiscal years 1975-1976, 25%
in 1977-1978, and 20% thereafter, as substantial new facilities are
placed in service and leakage detection measures are taken.
5.        Continuation of the existing water rates of the WE's, except
Samarinda, is assumed through FY 1976 and through FY 1975 for Samarinda.



ANNEX 15
Page 2
(Thiis distinction is rmade because the fiscal year of Samarinda ends on
Decem1,er 31 and those of the others end on March 31.)  The following in-
creases in the present average water rates are assumiled to apply for the
entire TY 1977 (FY 1976 for Samarinda):  lalang 170%, Purwokerto 140%,
Banyuwangi 80%, Jambi 15%, and Samarinda 110%.  Thereafter, the water rates
reflect each year gradual increases so that in FY 1982 (FY 1981 for Samarinda)
returns of 6% of net fixed assets in service (less consumer contributions)
will be achieved.
6.        Meter rentals or other charges under existing rate schedules are
included in other fees where shown separately in the statements of the WE.
Charges for metered consumption are assumed to constitute all of the reve-
nues whien the above program of water rate increases is put into effect,
pending a study of water rate structures to be completed by that time.
Consumer payments for the cost of new connections are included in con-
sumer contributions in the balance sheet and cash flow projections (para 20).
7.        It is assumed that with increased levels of water sales and rates,
2' of annual water sales will be written off as bad debts.
S.        Operating expenses are assumed at substantially increasing levels
considered necessary to operate and maintain the systems adequately and to
provide for expanding volume of production and sales. Price increases are
assumed at the annual rates of 18% in FY 1975, 15% in FY 1976, and 12% in
FY 1977 and thereafter ("inflation factor"), except where otherwise indi-
cated.
9.        Personnel costs are based on increased numbers of staff recom-
mended by the management consultants to implement the improvement program
and on increased rates of personnel compensation designed to upgrade the
staffs and provide comparability under local conditions. The projected
increases in rates of compensation from FY 1974 to 1980, including the in-
flation factor, average on an annual basis approximately 24% for Malang, 18%
for Purwokerto, 22% for Banyuwangi, 25% for Jambi, and 27% for Samarinda.
After 1980, a 12% annual increase in average rates of compensation is assumed.
10.       Electricity costs are based on the volume of water produced, an
expected electric rate increase in FY 1974 from Rp 4 to Rp 6 per KWH for
electricity consumed, and increases in electric rates at the inflation
factor thereafter.  At present Malang, Purwokerto and Banyuwangi do not
incur significant electricity expenses.  Chemical expenses are based on
the chemical requirements for volume of water to be treated, and prices are
increased at the inflation factor.
11.       Office supplies expense is estimated to increase in proportion
to the numhber of customers.  Insurance expense is estimated on the basis
of 0.25% of the cost of buildings and 5% of office, transportation and
laboratory equipment. Price increases in both of these categories of
expense are assumed at the inflation factor.



ANNEX 15
Page 3
12.       Repairs and maintenance expense, in addition to labor included
in the item of personnel costs, is estimated at approximately 0.6% of the
gross value of average fixed assets in service each year. Price increases
are reflected for maintenance of existing fixed assets, and of new fixed
assets from the end of construction, at annual rates assumed for foreign
costs, i.e., 14% in FY 1975, 11% in FY 1976, and 7.5% in FY 1977 and there-
after.
13.       Depreciation of existing fixed assets is calculated on the basis
of an assumed remaining average useful life of 20 years, or an annual
rate of 5%. Depreciation of new fixed assets is calculated at a composite
rate developed for each WE on the basis of the estimated useful life of
each type of its property. These composite rates, which are applied to
average fixed assets in service each year, are 3.3% for Malang; 3.6% for
Purwokerto, Jambi and Samarinda; and 3.8% for Banyuwangi.
14.       Taxes on income payable to the Government by each WE as a
Perusahaan Daerah are assumed at annual rates of 20% of the first Rp 10
million of net income and 25% of net income exceeding that amount. Tax-
able net income is operating revenue less operating expense (including
depreciation but excluding taxes on income) and less interest on indebt-
edness. Other taxes are assumed not to be significant.
Balance Sheets and Cash Flow Statements
15.       In view of the lack of records of historical costs and physical
data, the amount of fixed assets in the initial balance sheet of each WE
as of March 31, 1972 (December 31, 1971 for Samarinda) has been estimated
by the consultants from available records and physical inspections at re-
placement cost at that date, less allowance for depreciation to reflect
the remaining useful lives of the properties. The depreciation allowance
in the income statement for FY 1972 (FY 1971 for Samarinda) has been omit-
ted from accumulated depreciation in the initial balance sheet, since fixed
assets at the end of that year is stated net of depreciation. Available
information indicates no loan indebtedness at that date and, in some cases,
cash balances of the water supply units, which are reflected in the initial
statements. In the absence of current information on receivables, other
assets or liabilities, which are not believed to be significant for purposes
of the projections, the statements for the first three fiscal years have
been estimated on a cash receipts and disbursement basis, with allowances
for depreciation, and on an accrual accounting basis thereafter.
16.       Cash balances are projected at a minimum of Rp 1 million or
one month's cash operating expenses, whichever is larger.
17.       Accounts receivable are estimated at 20% of billings, which is
considered reasonable in the light of present and proposed billing pro-
cedures, indicated payment practices of consumers, the projected volume
of sales, and proposed loan covenants invoking prompt payment procedures
for government agencies.



ANNEX 15
Page 4
18.       Inventories are estimated at 2% of the amount of gross fixed,
assets in service at the end of each year.
19.       Accounts payable are estimated at one-half month's cash operating
expenses.
20.       Costs of new connections are included in fixed assets, and payments
received from consumers for connections are credited to consumer contribu-
tions. An average cost per connection, including allowances for price and
physical contingencies, of Rp 30,000 is assumed, payable upon installation
by consumers other than residential and payable by residential users on the
basis of Rp 5,000 upon installation and the balance of Rp 25,000 in equal
monthly installments over a five-year period at an annual interest rate of
7-1/2%. The estimated receipts of payments for connections have been re-
flected in the projections on a cash basis. In practice, under the account-
ing system to be installed, receivables from consumers who are to pay in
installments will be recorded and will be credited as the payments are re-
ceived.
21.       The proceeds of the IBRD loan, together with other Government
funds, will be loaned by the Government to the WE's. The terms of the
loans and the related aspects of the financing plan, which were agreed at
negotiations, are as follows:
(a) Interest rate of 9% annually.
(b) The loans to each WE will be repayable in 48 equal
semi-annual installments of principal and interest
following a 6-year period of grace from the date of
the project loan agreement, which the projections
assume will be the first day of the WE's next fiscal
year, i.e. April 1, 1975 (January 1, 1975 for Samarinda).
Under-this assumption, the grace period would be the six
fiscal years 1976 to 1981, inclusive (FY 1975-1980 for
Samarinda). Interest will be waived during the grace
period, and the first payment of principal and interest
will become due in FY 1982 (FY 1981 for Samarinda).
(c) The Government will lend to each WE 60% of the project
costs and will make available as equity the remaining
40% of project costs, except that for Malang and
Purwokerto such percentages will be 70% and 30%
respectively. Any surplus amounts which the WE is
able to generate internally from its operations during
the 6-year grace period will be repaid annually to re-
duce the Government's equity.
22.       It is assumed that the estimated costs of immediate improvement
programs in Jambi (FY 1974 and 1975) and Samarinda (FY 1973 and 1974) are
met by Government grants. These amounts are shown as other capital expendi-
tures in the cash flow statements and as Government grants in the balance
sheets.



ANNEX 15
Page 5
23.       It is assumed that any additional external funds which may be
required by a WE for its operations in any year in which project construc-
tion costs have been met by Government loans and equity, will be met by
local government equity.  This occurs in the projections only to a rela-
tively small extent for Jambi in FY 1975 and Samarinda in FY 1974 and 1975.
