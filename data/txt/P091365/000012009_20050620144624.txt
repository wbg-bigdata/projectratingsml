Description           This second phase of the Social Sector Programmatic Development Policy
                      Credit (SSPC) series continues, through a DPC operation, to support
                      Bolivia's efforts to achieve selected MDGs through the implementation of
                      a number of key social sector policies that were designed during the first
                      phase of this program. The SSPC I1is expected to support social sector
                      policies with three broad goals in mind: (i)protecting the positive results
                      reached in the last decade in increasing access to and quality of health and
                      nutrition, education, water and sanitation, and social protection; (ii)
                      implementing the sectoral policy frameworks designed under the first phase
                      of this programmatic series to continue progress in social outcomes and
                      move closer to achieving a number o f specific Millennium Development
                      Goals (MDGs) by 2015; and (iii)strengthening the capacity of both the
                      Government and civil society to monitor and evaluate policies, increasing
                      accountability and effectiveness. Implementing these policies will advance
                      achievement of specific MDGs by 2015.
Benefits              The proposed series of SSPCs would help the Government in maintaining
                      progress in social sectors and improve access of the poor to basic services
                      in health and nutrition, education, water and sanitation and social
                      protection, by supporting the implementation of key actions as well as a
                      greater results-based orientation in the social sectors. This is expected to
                      lead to increased coverage in those sectors and put the country in a closer
                      path to achieve the MDGs.           Efforts to improve accountability and
                      transparency will enhance institutional sustainability of social policies
                      through increased civil society engagement, making social programs more
                      effective and sustainable.
Risks                 Country risks: On the political side, risks include: (i)changing political
                                                                                  a
                      situation and potential for social unrest, as reflected in the steady number o f
                      protests by unions, indigenous groups, and civil groups; (ii)    the uncertainty
                      on the outcome of the Hydrocarbons Law; (iii) country's different views
                                                                         the
                      on when and if to call a Constitutional Assembly that would discuss, among
                      other things, regional autonomies; and (iv) the current crisis related to the
                      termination of the contract of the company providing water and sanitation
                      services in the populous township of ElAlto, adjacent to L a Paz.
                      On the economy, GDP growth remains vulnerable to external shocks such
                      as commodity prices and interest rates, as well as internal instability. The
                      fiscal situation i s improving but remains delicate as the budget deficit
                      continues to be high;
                      Implementation risks: these are mostly derived from the country's risks,
                      and are related to: (i)stakeholder resistance to new Dolicies as



                                                 i

                     I demonstrated by the recent events in the water and sanitation sector in El
                       Alto; (ii) than expected progress in key participatory processes (such is
                                less
                       the case in the education sector) or (iii)institutional weaknesses. To
                      mitigate this, the Government has made concerted efforts to address the
                       demands of protesters without resorting to the use of force, and has
                      developed and strengthened new mechanisms for popular political
                      participation. The Bank and the international community have vigorously
                       supported these efforts.

                                   I. INTRODUCTION

1.      The Social Sector Programmatic Development Policy Credit T I (SSPC II),second in a
                                                                                    the
series of three programmatic credits, i s designed to support social sector policies with three
broad goals in mind: (i)  Protecting the positive results reached in the last decade in increasing
access to and quality of health and nutrition, education, water and sanitation, and social
protection; (ii)Implementing the sectoral policy frameworks designed under the first phase of
this programmatic series to continue progress in social outcomes and move closer to achieving a
numberof specific MillenniumDevelopment Goals (MDGs)by 2015; and (iii)           Strengthening the
capacity of both the Government and civil society to monitor and evaluate policies, increasing
accountability and effectiveness.
2.      Bolivia remains one of the poorest countries in the region. It succeeded in reducing
poverty and improving social indicators during the early and mid-1990s as a consequence of
faster growth, targeted programs supported by increased resources (including HIPC resources),
and deeper decentralization. From 1992 to 2001, Unsatisfied Basic Needs (UBNs) and MDG-
related indicators improved, although progress has been insufficient and uneven.             UBNs
improved more inurban areas and many poor municipalities laggedbehind.
3.      In the social sectors, outcomes have improved steadily over the last decade.            For
example, maternal mortality dropped from 416 per 100,000 live births in 1989 to 235 in 2003;
infant mortality decreased from 89 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1989 to 54 in 2003; and net
enrollment in primary education increased from 74 percent in 1990 to 97 percent in 2000 while
primary completion rates (8th grade) increased from 55 percent in 1992 to 72 percent in 2001.
Similarly, national coverage of drinking water rose from 54 percent in 1992 to 72 percent in
2001. These positive outcomes have been the result of an increased budgetary support in the
social sectors, better policies, and an explicit decision to prioritize activities in these sectors.
Despite these achievements, most social indicators (primary education i s a notable exception) are
still markedly worse than other countries in the region, and significant progress i s required to
reduce that gap.
4.      Bolivia's progress in improving social services and outcomes means that there is a good
chance that many of the MDGs will be met or will be very close to the target by 2015. If current
trends continue, the goals of universal primary education and gender equality in primary
education are likely to be met, and goals on reduced child mortality, improved maternal health,
combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, and access to safe drinking water could be
reached with slight improvements in performance. It i s unlikely that the first goal of the MDGs
(eradicate extreme poverty and hunger) will be achieved. In order to maintain progress achieved
inthe social sector MDGs,it is critical to keep the social sectors on the national agenda, andthis
SSPC shows the Government's commitment to do that.
5.      However, the current situation prevailing in Bolivia could not only halt further progress
in social outcomes, but potentially even reverse some of these gains.        The economy i s still
fragile, although GDP growth has recovered from the economic crisis o f the late 1990s and early
2000s and fiscal policy is being put on a path toward sustainability.        The volatile political



                                                 1

context, highlighted by the recent spate of protests, has further limited the Government's
freedom to maneuver.
6.      In this context, a commitment to a given set of policies may be seen as questionable.
Clearly, risks are present, as recent events in the water sector highlight.' But the impressive
strides in greater participation of civil society in the design of social sector policies point toward
greater consensus among different social actors regarding these policies. Irrespective of how the
current situation i s resolved, the Government will continue providing social services to the
population since all sides of Bolivia's political spectrum agree on the need to increase the
quantity and improve the quality of those services. The issues addressed by this program are
central for Bolivia's development irrespective of how current circumstances evolve.
7.      The project continues the work laid out by the Social Sector Programmatic Structural
Adjustment Credit I(SSPSAC I).          While the first phase focused on the design o f policies and
interventions, this second phase begins their implementation in the key social sectors and starts
showing some of the outcomes resulting from these policies. The third phase of the program i s
expected to implement most policies fully and show additional results.
8.      The SSPC IIwill support the following actions in each sector (more details on both
policies and outcomes are provided inthe sections on each sector, found later inthis document):

e   Healthand Nutrition: Expand coverage of primary-level health care to underserved groups,
    increase cultural awareness of health service provision to indigenous people, and improve the
    functioning of the health service network.
e   Education: Reach an agreement among stakeholders on the contents of the Bolivian
    Education Strategy through the national education council and departmental education
    congresses. Begin implementing interventions to increase completion rates in primary
    education, improve its quality, and improve secondary education.
e   Water and Sanitation: Strengthen the regulatory framework to improve the flow of public
    and private investment resources to expand coverage of potable water and sewage at a
    reasonable cost.
e   Social Protection: Begin implementation of a newly-created strategy of social protection
    interventions targeted to specific vulnerable groups, such as children andunemployed.
e   Accountability and Participatory Monitoring: This component, which cuts across all
    sectors, focuses on increasing citizen access to information, strengthening the country's
    capacity to monitor and evaluate progress in achieving MDGs and to improve dissemination
    of that information to help improve the provision of MDG-related social services.
9.      The support provided by this DPC i s selective.         It focuses on the MDGs related to
education, health, and water and sanitation. It builds mostly upon existing institutions and legal
frameworks rather than seek legislative changes. It does not focus on activities designed to
improve income or consumption measures of poverty, as those policies are being currently
discussed and will be supported through other channels. Nor does it concentrate on those MDGs
where Bolivia does not face a significant problem or where progress has been substantial (like
HIV/AIDS).
10.     The proposed credit i s fully aligned with the CAS presented to the Board on January 8,
2004. It clearly identified the role of this series of DPCs in supporting progress in the social

                                                    2

sectors, highlighting that particular attention would be paid to reducing inequality in education,
health and nutrition, and water and sanitation outcomes across municipalities, ethnic groups and
income classes. This credit i s also consistent with the CAS progress report currently under
preparation, which, given the current situation in Bolivia, will include the scope for a third DPC
inthe social sectors under this fragile context. The SSPC IIis the only DPC operation scheduled
for this fiscal year, and provides an anchor for the different policies that the Government is
implementing in the social sectors, many of which are supported also by sectoral investment
loans. For FY06 the Bank will support Bolivia on a number of activities promoting institutional
reforms andincome generation, particularly inthe rural and agriculture sector.
11.    This Program Document describes the main issues and constraints that Bolivia faces in
improving social sector outcomes and the actions that the Social Sector Programmatic Credit
(SSPC) series i s supporting to assist the Government in addressing those constraints. Due to the
rather difficult political and social situation in Bolivia over the past months, progress towards
compliance with SSPC-supported actions has varied by sector, and in some cases has been
slower than originally expected. Nevertheless, steady progress has been achieved, and it i s
unquestionable that the SSPC-supported actions have assisted the Government in fulfilling its
commitment to maintain the impressive gains it achieved over the last ten years in social sector
outcomes.
                                  11.     COUNTRY CONTEXT

The PoliticalContext
12.    Bolivia's political context i s       uncertain.      Since October 2003, when violent
demonstrations resulted in the resignation of the previous President, Gonzalo Sanchez de
Lozada, social movements have been demanding greater inclusion in national issues. Highland
indigenous groups in both the countryside and inurban areas have increased their pressure on the
Government through frequent street protests and highway blockades. As well, residents of the
economically-powerful lowland region of Santa Cruz have stepped up their calls for regional
autonomy, further polarizing the country. The highland versus lowland tension also reflects a
split between mainly AymardQuechua and mainly Spanish descendants that has always been
present, but has intensified following recent events.
13.    A major flashpoint has been Government policy related to the energy industry, in
particular the design of the new Hydrocarbon Law governing private companies exploiting
Bolivia's natural gas reserves. Disagreements over the details o f the law led to President Carlos
Mesa's threat to resign, which was rejected by Congress on March 8. An aborted effort to
reduce subsidies on domestic fuel sales also led to major protests. The Constituent Assembly has
been delayed also, as the Law convening the Assembly was not drafted as expected, by the end
of 2004. To its credit, the Government has managed to appease social tension without resorting
to force, but at the high cost of giving in to many opposition demands. Examples of this are
rescinding the contract with Aguas del Zllimani (a subsidiary o f the French multinational Suez
Lyonnaise des Eaux, and provider o f water services to the municipalities o f L a Paz and El Alto)
due to protests in El Alto, and the agreement to a bindingreferendum on regional autonomy and
the election of governors as a result o f conflicts in Santa Cruz.
14.    Despite President Mesa's high level of personal popularity and his efforts to reach
compromises with opposition groups, the political crisis i s not over. No consensus has been
reached on the design of the new Hydrocarbon Law, and other issues such as regional autonomy


                                                    3

and disputes about water have yet to be resolved. However, in part because o f the governance
difficulties faced by Bolivia, the country has embarked on an ambitious effort to design
government policies through mechanisms that promote a high level of participation by civil
society. There have been broad consultation processes over the last 15 months, including the
bindingreferendum on gas policy, municipal elections and the third National Dialogue to revise
the PRSP. A Constituent Assembly to redesign the Constitution, although delayed, i s still
planned and could take place this year. While this participatory process i s by its very nature
turbulent and uncertain, it holds out the possibility of creating agreement among different
political actors on the broad outlines of national policy, which can then be implemented
regardless of political change.
Poverty and SocialIndicators'

15.     Inspiteofbeingoneofthepoorest andmostunequal countries inLatinAmerica, Bolivia
made significant efforts to reduce poverty and improving social indicators during the early and
mid-1990s. However after several external and internal shocks in 1999, growth decelerated, and
fiscal imbalances and financial sector difficulties weakened macroeconomic stability. As a
result, poverty stopped decreasing, and even increased slightly, as did inequality measures,
highlightingthe vulnerability of the poor. The incidence of poverty increased from 62 percent to
65 percent during 1999-2002, and extreme poverty rose from 36 percent to 37 percent. Poor
urban households were particularly affected. Metropolitan poverty reversed to the levels of the
early 1990s. The incomes of the poor in main cities declined on average 0.8 percent per year
over the 1993-2002 period. About 54 percent of the urban population lived in poverty in 2002,
of which almost half could not afford basic food needs. Rural poverty incidence also increased
during 1999-2002 to reach 82 percent, although extreme poverty declined 2 percentage points,
potentially linkedto within-rural migration to areas with expanding agricultural production (e.g.,
soy beans, livestock).
16.     Income inequality increased during 1997-2002.                The Gini coefficient for household
incomes increased nationally from 56.8 to 58.8 (with 0 corresponding to perfect equality and 100
to complete inequality) and from 50.4 to 53.9 inmaincities during 1997-2002. The high-income
inequality reflects significant disparities in assets (education, land and housing), household size,
and earnings differentials by gender, ethnicity, location, and type of employment.

Macroeconomic Framework

17.     Background: Bolivia has managed to sustain GDP growth during 1999-2004, despite a
regional financial crisis and domestic social volatility, although at much lower rates than during
the mid-1990s. This success-relative          to the performance of other economies in the region-
resulted from the sustained strengthening of the financial sector and a skillful management of
exchange rate policy; the support from the international community; and discoveries of natural
gas reserves. Growth has been driven by gas exports, expanded soy exports given improved soy
prices, and economic recovery inBolivia's maintrading partners.
18.     Recent Economic Developments: During2003-2004 average GDP growth reached 3.8 per
cent. In 2004 exports increased by 35 percent and real GDP growth i s expected to reach almost

4 percent. Twelve-month inflation remains at single-digit levels (Figure 1). Unemployment,
officially below 10 percent, has increased during the last six years. In 2004, cut in public
expenditures, administrative measures to prevent further pension cost increases, and revenue
measures to increase collections contributed to reduce the budget deficit by 2.3 percentage
points, to 5.7 percent of GDP (Figure 2).

19.     The financial system i s improving but i s still fragile, with non-performing loans at 16
percent o f total loans. Bank deposits remain volatile and loans continue decreasing (Figure 3).
The Central Bank continues skillfully managing the exchange rate-there                   i s no indication of
currency appreciation-and        net international reserves at end-December 2004 were above their
end-2003 levels.       The 2004 IMF program was on track with all 2004 fiscal, financial and
monetary targets met, with the exception of the limit of the Central Bank credit to non-financial
public sector. Total combined public sector debt was 68 percent o f GDP in 2002, risingto about
80 percent in 2004 (Figure 4). O f this total, about 26 percent of GDP i s denominated domestic
debt, which is largely dollar-denominated and held by pensionfunds and financial institution^.^

Economic Outlook

20.     InApril 2005 the IMFextended the current Bolivia's Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) until
March 2006. A new PRSP i s also in the makingwith a focus on the productive sector, following
the conclusions of the latest National Dialogue. However, the Government faces significant
challenges including a good hydrocarbons law and gas strategy, both expected to be delivered in
the coming months. Both will lead to resumption of capital inflows, in particular foreign direct
investment, and will open new export opportunities in the context of the free trade agreements
being negotiated in the region4.
21.     Short-term prospects: In the short term, current growth rates are expected to continue,
contingent in a favorable external environment. Real GDP growth would reach 4 percent in 2005
buoyed by hydrocarbons and mineral exports. Inflation is expected to remain under control. The
2005 fiscal deficit would be reduced to 5.1 percent of GDP in line with the IMF program,
resulting from increased fiscal revenues resulting from expanded gas exports to Brazil and
Argentina, and reductions in public spending and public subsidies. The external current account
surplus should diminish as external conditions gradually normalize and external remittances
gradually increase. FDI flows are expected to recover gradually in order to finance projects in
miningandhydrocarbons (see Table 1).




3. Domestic public debt does not include the debt held by the Central Bank with 99-day maturity at virtually zero
   interestrates.
4. However, if the current export privileges underthe Andean Pact end, soy exports may slow down.

22.     Medium term prospects: In the medium-term, real GDP growth is expected to converge
to 3.6 percent by 2007 as external conditions normalize, domestic aggregate demand increases
slightly, gas exports gradually increase from 2006 onwards and no other significant export gas
project i s carried out in the medium-term. Inflation i s projected to remain around 4 percent,
reflecting limited domestic credit expansion by the Treasury, assuming that additional external
financing closes the public sector financial gap and a gradual liberalization of fuel prices in the
domestic market. The current account deficit i s expected to decline to 2 percent of GDP by
2007-assuming        a gradual recovery of the aggregate demand, an increase of external remittances
and a slight increase in FDI flows boosting imports; exports would grow conservatively.
Provided that additional fiscal adjustment measures are adopted, the fiscal deficit will move
towards 3.2 percent o f GDP by 2007. Possible fiscal measures include: tax increases in the
hydrocarbon sector, possible reform of the RC-IVA, and the introduction o f spending caps in
current spending.
Debt SustainabilityAnalysis

23.     Debt sustainability analysis (see Annex 6 for more details) indicates that assuming the
current macroeconomic program stays in place and Bolivia's gas project materializes, Bolivia
will continue servicing its debt and prevent an explosive debt path (Figure 5). As shown in the
Annex, if the gas project does not materialize, a faster fiscal adjustment will be needed to make
the debt sustainable.

                           111.      THE GOVERNMENTPROGRAM

24.     The Government implemented a number of sweeping reforms during the 1980s and
1990s that improved social sector outcomes significantly. In spite of these results, Bolivia still
lags behind other countries of the region in terms of its human development indicators -with
the notable exception of primary education. Challenges to successfully implement its social
sector development strategy include: (i)       poor indicators in various social sectors, and in some
cases-like   some nutrition indicators or health intermediate outcomes-a                    recent reversion in
their positive trends; (ii) persistence of chronic poor-performing municipalities and important
                          the
inequalities across different population subgroups (urban and rural, non-indigenous and
indigenous, rich and poor) masked by national averages; (iii)                   a difficult social and political
situation that puts pressure on all sectors and threatens the scope and momentum of social sector
policies and programs; and (iv) slow progress inthe adoption of a results-based orientation inthe
social sectors that reaches the municipal level.
25.     The Government i s currently preparing a new development strategy (EBD) with
proposals for employment generation, growth, and poverty reduction, as well as medium-term
goals for the period 2005-2015 in order to achieve the MDGs. It i s a continuation of the PRSP
approved in 2000, emphasizing social problems and outcomes both from a social and a
productive perspective, in which generating employment opportunities takes a larger role than in
previous strategies. A draft version of the strategy targets six strategic objectives:
    .   Reduce the dependency on international cooperation (increase domestic savings, boost
        private investments, develop capital markets)
        Increase competitiveness
        Becomethe economic hub of the region
    +   Reduce poverty andinequality
    +   Promote internal cohesion and integration to the global economy
        Promotejudicial security, institutional development and rule of law

26.      Inthe social sectors, emphasis is placed on economic growth and a decrease ininequality
by improving distribution of resources, with the public sector having a strong role in
implementing active policies of transfers to the poor and employment generation. The basic
framework in the social sectors chapters of the EBD is based on achieving the MDGs. The
technical group in charge of drafting the EBD, UDAPE, has set up a team that monitors progress
towards achieving the MDGs both at the national and when possible at the municipal level, and
i s using a set of dynamic models to estimate the inputs and activities necessary to achieve
progress (both of these activities are supported by the SSPC 11). Table 2 shows the estimates for
selected MDGs inthe sectors supported by the SSPC series.

27.     As mentioned before, Boliviahas made significant progress inthe MDGsdirectly related
to the social sectors, and it i s likely that many of those MDGs will be met (or will be very close
to the target) by 2015. The numbers in Table 1 suggest that while the first goal of the MDGs
(eradicate extreme poverty and hunger) will not be achieved, all goals related to the social sector
(goals 2 through 7) are likely to be achieved if the trends are maintained (goals 2 and 3) or
slightly improved (goals 4,5,6, and 7). In order to prevent that the progress achieved in the
social sector MDGs be reverted, it i s critical to maintain the social sectors on the national
agenda, and this SSPC shows the Government's commitment to it.

LINKTO CAS
28.      The SSPC 11i s the only DPC operation scheduled for this fiscal year, and i s fully
consistent with the CAS presented to the Board on January 8, 2004. At the time it was agreed
that the Bank would assess in June and December 2004 whether Bolivia was still in the Base
Case or if it should move to the Low Case, according to the triggers stipulated in the 2004 CAS
(Table 3). Based on these assessments, it was decided that Bolivia would remain in the Base
Case, as the Government did not significantly backtrack on reforms, fiscal and debt sustainability
didnot deteriorate, and economic growth did not worsen. Inaddition, the Government extended
its current Stand-By Arrangement with the IMFon April 8.
29.      The Bank continues to monitor the situation closely, given the uncertainties in the
Hydrocarbon Law issue. The Bank has decided to limit IBRDfinancing to Bolivia until there i s
clarity with the hydrocarbonlaw.

                                                          under implementation.
                                                          Regarding the Institutional Reform Program, all of the
                                                          Institutional Reform Agreements that have been signed
                                                          are being implemented satisfactorily.       Furthermore,
                                                          according to an independent evaluation financed by
                                                          donors and the Bank, agreements signed with Customs,
                                                          Internal Revenue Services and the Road Service have
                                                          been highly satisfactory.
                IMPLEMENTATIONCAPACITY                    Portfolio implementation is on track, as evidenced by:
 Low                                                      a) A disbursement ratio in FY04 of 31 percent, and in
 Substantial deterioration in portfolio implementation.   FY05 (as of April) of 22 percent.
 Evidence would be: a) A disbursement ration below 15     b) Currently 27 percent of the projects in the portfolic
 percent per year; b) Number of problem projects          are considered to be problem projects; however it i s
 exceeding 25 percent of total projects; c) Effectiveness expected that before the end of FY05 the ratio will
 delays on new loans averaging 9 months or more.          decreaseto less than 20 percent.

I                                                         c) There are no effectiveness delays.

30.     The proposed credit i s fully aligned with the CAS presented to the Board on January 8,
2004, which defined the strategy to support six Government priorities. One of these priorities
was the implementation of high visibility programs that address exclusion, inequality and
poverty - underlying factors that led to social conflict in the country. The CAS clearly identified
the role of the series of DPCs (Social Sector Programmatic Credits) in supporting the
Government's efforts to maintain advances in water and sanitation, health, education and
accelerate progress towards meetingthe MDGs.
31.     The CAS included another DPC: a series of two Programmatic Bank and Corporate
Sector Restructuring Program. The first Credit was approved in FY04 and is currently being
implemented; the second was supposed to go to the Board in FY05, but there have been delays
andit is expected to go to the BoardinFY06.Inalignment with the Government's priorities, the
Bank decided to move forward with the second DPC (SSPC 11).

COLLABORATIONWITH THE IMFAND OTHER DONORS

32.     Since Bolivia i s still recovering from a fragile economic situation, monitoring o f
macroeconomic conditions by the IMF was essential this year, and the Bank has coordinated
closely with the Fund on monitoring the macroeconomic performance of the country for the
preparation of the SSPC 11. In addition, the work initiated during the preparation of the SSPSAC
Iwith other multilateral and bilateral international donors has continued.             This close
collaboration i s particularly important in the case of Bolivia, where resources from the
international cooperation represent roughly 9 percent of GDP (and, in some sectors, cover almost
all the available resources for investments).
33.     The SSPC 11has benefited from coordination with KfW Entwicklungsbank, as the set o f
SSPC operations are being preparedjointly by the Bank and the German Government, who i s co-
financing them. Joint work between KfW and the Bank contributed to advance all stages of
project preparation. This collaboration included close coordination and technical assistance by
KfW and GTZ in the identification, discussion and preparation of the components identified in
this program, with particular emphasis in the water and sanitation and social protection
components.
34.     The coordination with donor agencies goes beyond the preparation of the SSPC series, as
harmonization efforts are being pursued in other areas, like the education sector, where work has
progressed significantly inharmonizing the work o f many donors including the Bank.

RELATIONSHIPTO OTHER BANK OPERATIONS

35.     The proposed SSPC complements ongoing work supported by other IDA financial
assistance, as follows:
        Inthe area of decentralization, the SSPC 11complements a recent series of Programmatic
        Structural Adjustment Credits. The two credits disbursed under this program (in 2001
        and 2003) focused on the relationship between the central and subnational levels o f
        government, and aimed at increasing the efficiency and transparency of Bolivia's
        decentralized government system, and improving the capacity of the decentralized
        government system to deliver services.



                                                 12

    .   In the area of institutional reform, the ongoing Institutional Reform Project (IRP) aims to
        create the framework for a modern public sector, as well as to build several model
        agencies in order to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, quality and transparency of
        public services delivery.
        Inthe social protection area, the SSPC provides continuity to and enhances the progress
        achieved under the 2003 Social Safety Net Adjustment Credit. In particular, it builds on
        lessons learned in budget protection efforts for core social expenditures, maintains
        relevant social targets for prioritized programs, and further develops social protection
        programs.
        The SSPC i s aligned with ongoing investment operations, including the Health Sector
        Reform Project (APL-11), the Education Reform Project and the Education Quality
        Project, which provide funding for technical assistance and investments in some of the
        specific areas needed to secure progress toward achieving the MDGs.
36.     Regarding new operations, the FY07-08 pipeline will be defined by general areas rather
than specific projects due to the prevailing political uncertainty. Future operations will have as
one of their main objectives the preservation of the achievements in reducing inequality in
education, health and water and sanitation outcomes, with particular emphasis on the poor.
Some of the FY06 pipeline operations oriented towards institutional reforms (Institutional
Reform 11) and income generation (Rural Space) and the education (Secondary Education
SWAp) will reinforce to the work of this DPC.

ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

37.     Inaddition to the work the Government is doing through UDAPEand the teams working
on monitoring MDGs, the SSPC series also builds on previous analytical work performed in the
country and in the social sectors. Table 4 summarizes key recommendations from recent
analytical work that were taken into account while preparing this Credit and its predecessor, the
SSPSAC I.Later in the document, when the specific actions in each sector are described,
additional analytical work i s highlighted.

CHOICE OFINSTRUMENT

38.      Bolivia remains in an uncertain, fragile political and social environment. Nonetheless, a
DPC continues to be an appropriate instrument with which to support Bolivia's social policies at
this point in time, in combination with the broader Bank investment program in the social
sectors. The Bank has operational experience using DPCs in other fragile states in recent years,
for example in Afghanistan, West Bank-Gaza and Timor-Leste. The lessons learned from these
cases i s that in states that show very slow improvements or are undergoing a fragile political

transition - both of which characterize Bolivia's current situation - policy-based lending can
provide a much-needed sense of policy direction, allowing governments to look beyond
immediate problems and begin addressing key structural development constraints.
39.     The DPC provides continuity in policies at a time of change, yet at the same time
provides some flexibility in specific actions. B y specifying benchmarks for the next phase, it
also creates a future policy path to achieve certain outcomes that could not be accomplished by a
stand-alone operation. And by helping design a policy "umbrella", this operation provides a
framework for future investment and technical assistance operations in the social sectors by the
Bank, and also aligns the interventions of other donors, as shown by the activities being
supported in the education and water sectors. In addition, it commits the Ministry of Finance to
work together with the social sector ministries, and in this way provides a stronger signalrelative
to the importance of the activities supported by the operation.
40.     This operation i s complemented by ongoing projects that focus on institutional reform,
tackle inequality, address income generation, and support the education and health sector
(detailed inthe previous section).

OPERATIONDESCRIPTION

41.     The SSPC series was designed to help the Government maintain progress in health and
nutrition, education, water and sanitation, and social protection at a time of fiscal constraints. An
important aspect of this progress i s to alleviate disparities in outcomes across different regions,
ethnic groups and social classes, contributing toward achieving a number of MDGs. While
successful reforms inthese areas have contributed to improvements insocial indicators in the last
decade, the difficult economic and political situation of the last few years has shifted debate and
attention away from the social sectors. There was a risk that the Government, in its efforts to
reform the productive sectors and promote job creation, may neglect to carry out additional
actions required to maintain and accelerate needed progress in the social sectors. The
Government's continued commitment to the SSPC series is a strong signal of its determination to
continue work inthese areas.
42.     The issues that motivated the preparation of the SSPC series remain valid. This second
phase of the SSPC continues its support to the Government's Social Sectors Program (see Letter
of Policy Development in Annex 1). The first phase of the series focused on the design of
improved social sector policies to maintain progress in outcomes. This proposed second phase
moves to start the implementation of those policies, and the tracking of social outcomes. These
policies relate not only to the specifics o f how services are provided, but also measures to
increase a results-based orientation in some programs, promote accountability, and strengthen
participatory monitoring of MDGs. The planned third phase o f the program i s expected to
implement most policies fully and show additional results.
43.     The SSPC Program series consisted originally o f three single tranche credits; the first
one, approved by the board in June 2004, was for SDR 17.2 million (approximately US$25
million). Given the special circumstances in the country, the resulting uncertainties and the need
to discuss a new CAS by mid 2005, the amounts for the second and third credits were not
discussed during the preparation of the first operation. During the pre-identification mission for
this operation it was agreed to disburse approximately the same amount as in the first SSPSAC.
However, in light of the recent events in the water sector (see section on Water and Sanitation



                                                  15

below), the amount for this second loan has been reduced from approximately US$25 million to
US$15 million.
44.     Duringthe preparation of the first SSPSAC, the Government and the Bank agreed on a
number of benchmarks to be supported by the SSPC series to measure progress in achieving the
objectives of the Government's Social Sectors Program. A detailed set of benchmarks for the
second and third phases is specified in the Policy Matrix (Annex 2). All of the actions for the
second phase are prior actions. Among them however, some key actions have been defined as
triggers or minimumconditions to proceed with this operation (highlighted in bold in the Policy
Matrix). In the same fashion, the Bank and the Government have agreed on a set of minimum
triggers that should be implemented in order to proceed with the processing of the third
operation.
45.     The SSPSAC Ihad eight triggers to proceed with preparation of the SSPC 11. The trigger
referring to the macroeconomic framework and the two related to participatory monitoring
(triggers number 1, 7, and 8 respectively) were met as originally stated; the trigger related to
social protection (trigger number 6) was fully met and actually strengthened by including one of
the benchmarks that became more relevant to the program; the health trigger (trigger number 2)
was substantially met, as three out of four indicators were met as expected and the fourth showed
significant progress; the education trigger (trigger number 3) was partially met due to a change in
the country's circumstances. Finally, the two triggers related to the water and sanitation sector
(triggers 4 and 5) were partially met but were withdrawn due to the current situation in the
sector. Detailed assessment of each of the triggers i s provided in the Policy Areas section.
46.     The reason behind withdrawing the water and sanitation triggers i s the following. While
the Bank acknowledges the progress made in the global policies for the sector, the recent events
with the private provider of water services in the municipalities of L a Paz and El Alto (see
section on Water and Sanitation for details) has created uncertainty in the sector. Under these
circumstances it i s not possible to assert that the global policies are being implemented fully.
The Bank and its co-financier, the German Government through the Kfw, discussed and agreed
with the Government that it would be useful to continue monitoring the global policies for the
water and sanitation sector, providing additional technical assistance and advice. But at the same
time it i s not possible to support these global policies with funding until the uncertainty in the
sector gets resolved. It i s proposed to reduce the amount of the SSPC I1Credit, so that no
triggers or prior actions on water and sanitation will be included in the Policy Matrix.            In
recognition of the effort by the Government in defining future, better policies, the triggers will
not be eliminated but rather turned into benchmarks. If the Government continues to implement
the water sector policy reforms, if an acceptable solution i s adopted for L a Paz/El Alto, and if the
sector performance improves in the forthcoming months, the water sector triggers might be
reincorporated into the SSPC 111.
47.     The following table shows the list o f selected triggers and conditions to proceed with the
third phase of the program, which the govemment has committed to implement. In order to
provide a better sense of the logical flow o f actions, it also shows the triggers of the SSPSAC I.

POLICY AREAS
48.     Below are summarized the main issues, progress, and future actions in each of the four
sectors of health and nutrition, education, water and sanitation, and social protection, as well as
inthe cross-cutting theme of participatory monitoring and evaluation.

Health and Nutrition

49.     Main Issues. Over the last ten years Bolivia has made significant progress in improving
the health status of its population. The implementation of a series of health policies directed at
reducing maternal and infant mortality, controlling communicable diseases, and creating
incentives at the local level to improve health outcomes have contributed to increased access to
priority maternal and child interventions.       Coverage of skilled birth attendance more than
doubled, from 25 percent in 1994 to 54 percent in 2002; immunizations of children under 1year
with the third dose of the DPT vaccine, which had dropped to as low as 71 percent in 1996 (in
administrative records), recovered with the reforms and exceeded 95 percent in 2001. Data from
the 2003 DHS national survey shows a drop in infant mortality from 67 deaths per 1,000 live
births in 1998 to 54 deaths in 2003, and similarly a decrease in maternal mortality from 390 per
100,000 live births in 1994 to 235 per 100,000 live birthsin 2003. In addition, the strengthening
of vertical programs was successful in controlling communicable diseases and reducing their
incidence. For example, the malaria Annual Parasitic Index (API) dropped substantially, from its
peak of 24.8 per 1,000 inhabitants living inendemic areas in 1998.
50.     Inspite of this progress, the recent economic crisis and arelative slowdown inthe pace of
implementation of reforms and programs threaten further health improvements. Four major
problems remain: (i)    in recent years, the rate of increase in coverage of maternal and child
interventions has been tapering off; (ii)     there i s a gap in access to health services between
different socio-economic groups and between indigenous and non-indigenous populations; (iii)
malnutrition levels are among the worst in the region; and (iv) the incidence of TB, Chagas, and
malaria are still high in some municipalities, with irregular financing that threatens the
sustainability of vertical programs, including immunizations.
51.     Government strategy. The Government strategy focuses on specific actions in five
areas, supported by the SSPC series, with particular emphasis on priority municipalities - those
with the highest risk in terms of health status and poverty - in an effort to improve outcomes.
The selected areas of intervention include:
    Expanding coverage of primary health care to undersewed areas to reduce the equity gap,
    recognizing Bolivia's cultural diversity. The Government will reform some of the rules and
    procedures of its targeted health subsidy, SUMI, to reinforce prevention activities (including
    counseling in sexual and reproductive health, and in nutrition), and to enhance demand and
    access b y population living in poor rural areas. A thorough impact evaluation of SUMI i s
    currently under way, and the results of this evaluation will feed into the redesign of the
    program in an effort to improve targeting to poor and rural (primarily indigenous) areas that
    have less access to tertiary care facilities.

0   Implementing policies and interventions targeted at reducing malnutrition and anemia in
    children under three and pregnant women. The Government has committed to develop and
    implement a national nutrition policy, including a package of targeted cost-effective
    interventions to be implemented in high-risk municipalities. This program will start as a


                                                  20

    pilot in 25 municipalities and will expand to additional municipalities in the future. As in
    many other countries facing similar issues, the nutrition program will become part of the
    social protection strategy that Bolivia i s beginningto implement.

    Reducing the incidence and morbidity from immune-preventable diseases, malaria, Chagas
    and TB. The Government is committed to ensuring sufficient financing of these programs to
    achieve a set of results inline with the MDGoutcomes inthe middle term.

    Improving thefunctioning of the health service network at the municipal level and providing
    incentives to achieving the MDGs. Since 1999, the health sector began introducing
    performance agreements that set annual targets in priority health indicators at the national,
    regional and local levels. The performance agreements are quasi-contracts between different
    levels of government which contain the expected results and the resources allocated to reach
    those results. The Government has signed performance agreements between the central level
    and nine regional health secretariats (SEDES), including indicators such as professionally-
    attended births and DPT immunization coverage. In 2003, the Government introduced an
    even more decentralized management model consisting of Local Health Boards (DILOS) and
    autonomously managed health networks. Each municipality has its own DILOS' responsible
    for setting the output targets well as the annual action plan.             While maintaining the
    performance agreements with all nine SEDES, the MOH will promote the use of
    performance agreements between the DILOS and the SEDES, which will then serve to
    monitor expected results at the municipal level and determine how those contribute to the
    goals at the departmental level. The M O H will support this effort by developing a policy for
    the sector that will ensure better distribution of health staff and create incentives to stay in
    rural areas and to improve their performance.
52.     Actions supported by the SSPSAC I.Under the first SSPSAC, the Government defined
a set of criteria to prioritize municipalities in terms of their likelihood of achieving the MDGs, to
place special emphasis on municipalities with worse outcomes. The Government also took the
following actions to extend health services to underserved areas and populations: (i)      designed an
impact evaluation of the SUM1 to determine the extent of system coverage; (ii)          published and
disseminated the bill of rights of pregnant women; (iii)     implemented surveys to look into quality
of care and patient satisfaction among indigenous populations; (iv) established an additional
source of fundingfor disease promotion activities and immunization programs through a decree,
in order to reduce dependency on donor assistance; and (v) created an office in the MOH to
design and implement health resources policy.
53.     Actions supported by the SSPC 11. The Government has advanced according to the
plan set duringpreparation of the first SSPSAC, and actions have been completed as follows:
Trigger (original): For 2004, (i)coverage with the third dose of DPT has increased in at
least 5 percentage points in no less than 40 percent of the chronic municipalities; (ii)the
Malaria IPA is less than or equal to 5.0 in the municipalities at risk; (iii)no more than 10
percent of the municipalities have a Chagas infestation rate higher than 3 percent; and (iv)
85 percent of the new positive cases of TB have been cured with DOTS.
Assessment: Out of the four indicators chosen in the trigger, three have been accomplished, as
follows:

5.  DILOS board members include one representative of the MOH (designated through its regional arm, the
    SEDES),one from the municipal government, and one from civil society.

      from Bs.15.6 million to Bs.19.7 million in 2004, and the approved budget for 2005 i s
      Bs.47million. Immunization rates increased in fifty percent of the municipalities defined as
      high risk due to their chronic level of low immunization rates. In addition the program
-     increased the number of doses applied at the national level by 6 percent compared to 2003.
      (ii) MalariaControlProgramsucceededinreversingtheupwardprevalenceofmalaria
                The
      cases registered in2003, and the API dropped to 4.2 in 2004 from 6.1 in2003.
      (iv) Approximately 86 percent of new reported cases of TB have been cured, as agreed inthe
      trigger.
      With respect to (iii), interruption of Chagas transmission is also registering important
                               the
      progress. Chagas disease i s endemic in 168 out of 314 municipalities, posing a serious health
      threat to four million people that are at risk of contracting the infection. The number of
      municipalities with infestation rate higher than 3 percent decreased from 94 in 2003 to 52 in
      2004, that is, more than a 40 percent reduction. The current percentage of municipalities
      with infestation rate higher than 3 percent i s however higher than the 10 percent goal set in
      the trigger.   Duringthe preparation of the SSPC 11, it became apparent that achieving the
      goal o f reducing the number of municipalities with Chagas infestation greater than 3 percent
      was going to be more difficult than originally anticipated. The revised trigger represents all
      the progress that can be reasonably expected and it i s still very significant compared to
      previous years. Therefore, the Government and the Bank have agreed to rewrite the trigger
      (as well as the trigger for the SSPC 111)as follows:
Trigger (revised): (iii) No more than 16 percent of the municipalities have a Chagas
Infestationratehigherthan3 percent.
Benchmarks. The progress inthe benchmarks hasbeenas follows:
-     With regards to the performance agreement with municipalities, the government has
      distributed the template to all the municipalities in the country, and will be signing
      agreements with 20 percent of all municipalities, setting targets on percentage of births
      attended by health personnel, number of cases of pneumonia in children less than five years
      of age, and immunization rates for children less than one year of age.
      The firm in charge of the SUMIimpact evaluation has begun the field work and the first set
      of results will be available by May 2005; inthe meantime the Government i s implementing a
      communications campaign mostly in underserved areas using radio stations that reach the
      rural population to promote the services offered by SUMIand provide some education about
      key health issues. The communication efforts carried out in 2003 resulted in a significant
      increase inthe number of consultations covered by SUMI, which rose from 4.4 million to 7.3

-     million between 2003 and 2004.
      A nutrition plan for at risk municipalities has been prepared, based on the involvement of
      communities to educate households on good nutrition practices, and will make use o f existing
      institutions like EXTENSA to promote better nutrition;6


    ~~    ~    ~




6. EXTENSA is an itinerant health service program that provides basic health care to underserved areas. There are
currently 59 itinerant teams that reach at risk municipalities. The program is being expanded trying to engage the
communities and the health facilities in the underserved areas.


                                                          22

    Coverage of services to indigenous populations has been targeted through a ministerial
    resolution that incorporates traditional doctors and midwives into the national health system,
    and through the purchase of special equipment in 60 facilities to make them more culturally-
    sensitive to indigenous patients.
54.     Expected outcomes of the policies. These actions are expected to lead in the medium
term to increased coverage of priority maternal and child interventions, especially in high-risk
municipalities, and further inclusion of indigenous populations in health care interventions.
Decreasing the equity gap in access to health services between the poor and the rich and the
indigenous and non-indigenous people should result in a reduction in infant and maternal
mortality and improvements inthe nutritional status of children inpoor areas.
55.     Expected costs of the policies. SUM1related activities will not have additional costs, as
the policies are purposely attempting to target the current expenditure better. The evaluation will
point out to areas where expenses are not directed to the neediest population and how to re-target
those expenses. The nutrition interventions will have an additional cost, and recent studies by
the World Bank point out that it would cost about US$5 million to develop a community based
nutrition program. The Government already has begun implementation of a community based
health program, EXTENSA, and the nutrition plan will be using its structure for the time being,
resulting in a negligible marginal cost. However it i s expected that starting next year the
Government will have to increase the budget of this program to accommodate nutrition and other
activities.
                                                   Education
56.     Main Issues. The last education reform process in Bolivia, launched in 1994, focused on
transforming and strengthening the educational system, improving the teaching quality, and
developing adequate human resource management in the sector. Eight years of implementation
of the Educational Reform Program (ERP) has led to meaningful changes in many important
education indicators in B01ivia.~Primary schooling i s almost universal, with net primary
enrolment rates at 97 percent in 2000 (up 23 percentage points from a decade before). Likewise,
the primary completion rate (8`h grade) increased from close to 12 percent before 1994 to 75
percent in 20048. Bolivia has also made a significant financial effort: the education budget
expanded from US$78 million in 1990 to US$192 million in 1999. Public expenditure in
education as a percentage of GDP increased from 3.6 percent inthe 90's to 6.8 percent in 2002.
57.     Despite these many achievements, numerous problems still hinder the education system.
Perhaps the most important i s that universal enrollment has not led to universal primary
completion, with 25 percent of children entering the school system failing to graduate from
primary school. Repetition and drop-out rates remain high.' Also important i s that even though


7. Another aspect of the ERP that must be emphasized is donor coordination. The ERP is strongly supported by
   multiple entities. The World Bank has provided support through two projects totaling US$115 million; the IDB
   has also invested US$80 million. Other important donors include the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany, Spain,
   Japan, UNICEF and USAID.
8. One of the ERP's achievements was an improved information system. This means that educational data
   previous to the ERP i s not highly reliable. Nevertheless, the best estimates of completion rates previous to 1994
   range from 10 percent to 14 percent, as shown in Bank Report No. 12042-BO (Bolivia Education Sector: A
   Proposed Strategy for Sector Development and International Assistance).
9.  These are gross completion rates, which refer to the number of students completing eighth grade at any age,
   divided by the number of children in the appropriate age group. This number may be superior to 100.

there i s no attendance gap between boys and girls from 5 to 11years of age, there i s still a gender
gap from 12 to 15, Boliviabeing one of the few Latin American countries that show gender gaps
unfavorable to females." A further challenge i s that secondary education remains neglected, its
curriculum i s outdated and its problems were largely ignoredinthe primary-focused ERP.
58.      Perhaps the most important cross-cutting problem affecting the education sector i s
governance. In the past two years, Bolivia has seen four education Ministers and none has
stayed at the post longer than eight months. In addition, there have been sweeping changes in
society and politics as new protagonists have appeared on the political scene and now place
demands which can no longer be ignored or postponed. Indigenous groups and other
stakeholders like teacher unions have shown a political strength which makes them forces that
mustbe included inthe policy dialogue.
59.      Government Strategy. The Government has responded to these challenges by making
the participatory building of a new education strategy the cornerstone o f its educational efforts.
This has taken two paths: the first is to prepare an Educational Strategy andthe second to consult
it as broadly as possible. The Ministry of Education is fully aware of the need to establish a
broad consultation process involving stakeholders at the local, departmental and national levels
to share, discuss and approve the proposed strategy. In the present political climate, failure to
promote this process would inevitably bring debilitating opposition to any policy initiative
through confrontations between the Ministry and the teachers' unions.
60.      The draft strategy proposal, called the Multi-annual Operational Program (Program
Operativo Multi Anual - POMA), contains broad guidelines on the objectives o f the national
Education Strategy for the next few years. This proposal has been widely discussed in two
different forum groups:
    The first i s composed of the educational councils, led by the National Education Council
    (Consejo Nacional de Educacidn - CONED) which consists of eighty members representing
    different government branches, civil society, unions, and other groups. This council was
    designed in the 1994 Education Reform Law to provide channels for community
    participation in educational policy decisions, but has never been implementeddue to political
    difficulties. Inaddition, there are nine departmental councils, as well as municipal and school
    councils (called juntas).
    The second i s composed of a series of events which are to culminate in the Second National
    Education Congress (ZI Congreso Nacional de Educacidn - ZZ CNE). The first CNE was
    convened in the first years o f the Reform (1994), but the second was postponed until now
    due to recurring political difficulties. Equally important as convening the Congress has been
    the preparatory workshops and congresses that have already been held as part o f the process.
    Eight departmental congresses, 12 national thematic workshops, and eight departmental
    workshops have allowed broad discussion of the Education Strategy.
61.      While the participatory process should lead to improving governance in the sector, the
POMA also deals with the key issues of improving coverage, completion rates, and quality,
while at the same time reducing inequalities in educational attainment and achievement. In
particular, its overarching general objective i s universal access to education, thus firmly
embedding in it the education MDG. While the participatory process continues, the Ministry of

Education has begun to implement some of the activities included in the POMA, consistent with
guaranteeing progress inthe universal primary education MDG.
62.     Inaddition, some steps arebeing taken to guaranteeprogress towards the reductionof the
gender gap in primary education. Bolivia i s one of the few Latin American nations to have an
anti-girl bias in education, which i s concentrated in rural municipalities.    Specific targeted
actions to maintain girls in school in selected municipalities, like the creation of boarding
schools and transport subsidies for girls in rural areas, will thus have a strong impact upon
female completion rates, thereby addressing the gender equality MDG. Finally the Ministry i s
also addressing the expansion with quality of secondary education, with particular emphasis on a
revision of its curriculum and the implementation of different models to improve coverage.
63.     Activities supported by the SSPSAC I.In line with the above strategy the SSPSAC I
supported the participatory creation of a new Educational Strategy, on the one hand, and specific
actions in equity in education and in curricular development at the secondary level, on the other.
Specific actions supported by SSPSAC Iin this direction included: (i)       creating the National
Education Council (CONED); (ii)     preparing a regulatory framework to establish how education
councils should operate; (iii) legally convening the Second National Education Congress; and
(iv) preparing the Multi-annual Operational Plan (POMA) 2004-2008, incorporating the
education MDGs in its objectives.
64.     Actions supported by SSPC 11. The government has advanced in the actions agreed in
the SSPC IIat a slower pace than originally envisioned.
Trigger (original). The POMA 2004-2008has beenpresentedto and debated by the Second
NationalEducation Congress.
Assessment: This trigger has been partially met. Due to opposition by the teacher's union, the
Second National Education Congress was not held and has been postponed indefinitely.
Nevertheless and in spite of the political crisis faced by the country, the Ministry of Education
was able to achieve the objectives behind the trigger. It organized and carried out eight
congresses at the departmental level and 12 national seminars where specific education policies
were presentedand debated. Therefore, even though the national congress has not been held, the
model of participative democracy ineducation continues to be strengthened and institutionalized.
The development o f the participative model in education continues in parallel with the
implementation of some of the actions in the POMA by the Ministry o f Education. Specifically,
the Ministry (i)  has expanded the involvement of municipalities in the process of distributing
educational materials to public schools; (ii)   expanded the number o f schools using bilingual
education modules and continued the mainstreaming of the intercultural bilingual education
model. Since the Education Congress has been postponed indefinitely, the Government and the
Bank have agreed on a new proposed trigger that supports the implementation of some of the
policies contained inthe POMA.
Trigger (revised): The Multi-Annual Operational Plan (POMA) was discussed widely in 8
departmental congresses and 12 National workshops. As a result of this consultation
process, the government has agreed to:
(i)expand the involvement of municipalities inthe distribution of educational material
from 0 to 36 in2005.
(ii)atleast20percentofpublicschoolsusingbilingualeducationmodulesin2005.

-       Benchmarks. The progress inthe benchmarks has been as follows:
    The CONED as well as the local school councils are institutionalized and meeting regularly.
    The Ministry of Education and CONED organized eight departmental education congresses
    and 12 thematic workshops to discuss the POMA.
    In preparationfor acomprehensive reformto enhance the secondary education level, the
    Ministryof Educationhas agreedto initiateby 2006 aprogram including: (i)four year
                                                                                   a
    financial plan; (ii)a teacher trainingproposal; (iii)
                                                        strengthening institutional capacity at the
    departmental and municipal levels; and (iv) a preliminary strategy for curriculum design.
    The Ministry has taken immediate actions to develop diversified supply of education
    services. It has already signed agreements with seven municipalities and contracts with two
    institutions to reduce the gender gap through the creation o f boarding schools and providing
    school transportation, among other actions. It i s expected that these measures will lead to a
    gender gap decrease, on average, of 20 percent inthe targeted municipalities.
66.     Expected outcomes from policies. The overarching objective i s the attainment of near
universal primary completion. The direct outcomes of the participatory consultation actions will
be a reduction in the political tensions surrounding the sector and, consequently, improved
governance. The actions in curricular development in secondary education should lead to
improved secondary education and better prospects for those who finish the primary level, and
thus should also contribute to improving primary completion. Lastly, the actions inreduction of
gender inequalities and distribution of materials will result in direct and immediate
improvements of completion rates.
67.     Expected costs of policies. A participative consultation process entails negligible
monetary costs. The costs of increasing access to secondary education, by contrast, are quite
high. A secondary school student costs about US$85 per year and the expected increase of
150,000 students over the next few years will amount to more than US$12 million per year.
However, the counterfactual to reforming the secondary school curriculum i s not these children
not going into secondary but rather children going into low quality secondary schools, repeating
and thus increasing the costs beyond US$12 million per year. This means that the curricular
actions may entail costs through higher entry rates due to a more attractive secondary education,
butthese should be compensated totally or partially by better student flow due to higher quality.
68.     The actions to reduce the gender gap and to distribute better materials to all primary
schools have non-negligible direct costs, but in the same way as better secondary schools reduce
costs by reducing repetition, these actions will do the same for primary schooling, so that once
again it i s uncertain whether there will be net costs or net savings. In any case, neither one will
be of great magnitude.
                                       Water and Sanitation
69.     Main issues. The urban population connected to potable water in Bolivia went from 26
percent in the 1970s to about 73 percent by 2002, and sewerage coverage rose from 30 to 42
percent duringthe same period. However, Bolivia still lags behind most Latin America countries
in terms of water and sewerage coverage rates. About 2.3 million of Bolivia's 8.5 million
inhabitants do not have adequate access to potable water and close to 5 million inhabitants do not
have access to adequate sanitation services. The average values also hide significant disparities
by income-88     percent of the richest quintile has access to water while 36 percent of the poorest


                                                  26

quintiles does-as    well as by geographical a r e a s 4 4 percent of households in rural areas have
improved water coverage compared to 90 percent inurban areas; and 40 percent o f households in
rural areas have sanitation coverage compared to 84 inurban areas.
70.      Factors that impede an increase in access to water and sanitation and improvements in
service provision inBolivia include: (i) performance of utility service providers, reflected in
                                         poor
low service quality, low administrative, technical, and financial management capacity, low
billing and collection rates (which limits expansion and leaves the poor underserved), and
inadequate maintenance; (ii)   weak institutional capacity and inadequate policies at the central
government level, as well as lack of technical assistance to support utility reform and improve
performance; and (iii) highinvestment needsbeyondthe central government's ability to mobilize
financing.
71.      Government strategy. The Government aims to meet the MDGfor water and sanitation
by halving the number of people without access to potable water and sanitation services of good
quality at affordable prices by 2015. Usingpublic financing effectively to give service providers
the incentives to improve their performance i s at the heart of the Government's strategy to
increase coverage. To this end, the Government designed and i s implementing a package of legal
and regulatory reforms aimed at creating a modern sector policy environment conducive to
improved performance by all water and sanitation service providers (public, private and
cooperative). Improved performance, in turn, represents the key enabler for expanded coverage
at reasonable prices for all. With its new approach to sector financing and technical assistance,
Boliviajoins a growing group of Latin American countries (including Chile, Colombia and most
recently Ecuador) that have restructured national financing schemes for the water and sanitation
sector to provide incentives for improved performance and increased coverage for the poor.
72.      Actions supported by the SSPSAC I.Under SSPSAC I, Government enacted a new
                                                                     the
law eliminating restrictions on direct channeling of public resources for investments in regulated
utilities, including cooperatives and utilities managed by private operators. In addition, the
Government has enacted two decrees: (a) the Water Sector Financial Policy Supreme Decree,
which replaces previous procedures for allocating credits and grants based only on poverty
considerations and introduces more well-defined sector-specific indicators for resource
allocation; and (b) a Technical Assistance Supreme Decree, which provides for the establishment
of FUNDASAB (Fundacidn de Apoyo a la Sostenibilidad en Saneamiento Bdsico), an entity
which will develop new institutional models for utility management and corporatization o f
municipal public utilities that do not wish to involve the private sector. FUNDASAB will also
provide technical assistance in the process of reforming public utilities and in improving their
performance, as well as environmental management and mitigation of environmental negative
impacts.
73.      The financial policy will be in legal effect by May 2005 and its operating scheme will
have been designed and will be ready for implementation. Consultants have started to work on
the institutional modernization program for sector utilities and on the regulations that will allow
FUNDASAB to have a legal status by May 2005. FUNDSAB is expected to become fully
operational later in the year.    The coverage targets for water and sewerage services show
progress, despite being revised downward two percentage points from the original objective o f
89 and 51 percent of potable water coverage for urban and rural areas respectively and three
percentage points from 53 and 34 percent o f sewerage inurban and ruralareas respectively.

74.     Recentdevelopments in the sector. Despite the progress towards an effective incentive
framework described above, the water and sanitation sector has suffered a severe setback over
the course of the past several months. Under pressure from a general strike organized by the
FEJUVE (Federacidn de Juntas VecinaZes) in El Alto, the Government issued a decree in
January, 2005, instructing the water regulator (SISAB) to terminate the concession contract of
Aguas del Zllimani (AISA), the private operator who had operated water and sanitation services
in El Alto and La Paz since 1997. l1The FEJUVE based its campaign both on philosophical
objections to any form of private sector participation in the provision of public services and
several specific grievances, including high connection charges faced by new users wishing to
connect to water and sewerage networks and the number of users in El Alto that remain
unconnected to the sewerage system seven years into the concession. While the concession had
producedsubstantial increases incoverage and quality of water and sanitation services inboth L a
Paz and El Alto, it faced a number of challenges including an investment program increasingly
unable to keep pace with highpopulation growth inEl Alto andhigh connection charges for new
users.
75.     The Government i s aware that a departure by Suez (the French concessionaire that leads
the AISA consortium) from Bolivia risks sending a very negative signal to foreign private
investors, who account for more than half of all investment inpublic infrastructure made over the
past decade. As well, these events have also seriously weakened the authority of the water
regulator (SISAB), which has had four superintendents in the space of four months. The
Government i s pursuinga two-track approach: on the one hand, it will carry out a comprehensive
technical and financial audit of AISA's operations as an input to negotiations for terminating the
concession contract, and on the other hand, it i s working to build consensus with municipal
authorities and other stakeholders on a new management model to replace the concession. Inthe
meantime, AISA continues to operate water and sanitation services inL aPaz and ElAlto.
76.     Considering these developments, the Bank faces two general options: to disengage from
the water and sanitation sector (within the context of the SSPC and perhaps more broadly), or to
work with the national government as well as municipal authorities and other stakeholders in L a
Paz and El Alto to identify alternatives to the concession model in these cities. Given the Bank's
familiarity with a range of models for service provision worldwide, the Government has already
engaged the Bank in a dialogue on possible alternatives. The Bank's leadership in providing
policy advice to the Government going forward i s all the more important, given the large number
of donors active inthe water and sanitation sector (EU, KfW, GTZ, COSUDE, IDB, CAF among
others) that look to the Bank to help provide a framework for external support. Against this
backdrop, the Bank proposes to continue monitoring water and sanitation actions as part of the
SSPC 11, now as benchmarks rather than triggers for disbursement. This position has been
agreed with the German Government, which i s co-financing the SSPC loans through the KfW.
Nonetheless, given the uncertain outcome of the situation inEl Alto and L a Paz, the Government
and the Bank have agreed to reduce the size of the credit in line with the change of water and
sanitation triggers to benchmarks.
77.     Benchmarks. Some actions have been revised with respect to what was agreed at the
time of preparation of the SSPSAC I,but the spirit of the actions remains unchanged and
progress has occurred, if slower than expected.

    The new financing policy and the Institutional Modernization Program for the water and

    FUNDASAB has been legally constituted, and all the necessary activities to begin its
    operation have been performed.
78.     Expected outcomes of policies. By the end of the three-credit program, the Government
expects to have completed the institutional reforms described above. Interms of physical goals,
the expected achievements are based on investment financing which has already been secured.
The combination o f the proposed reforms and the execution of the investments for which
financing has been secured (US$80 million in 2005 and US$83 million in 2006) are expected to
yield increases in water and sanitation coverage inurban and rural areas, as well as the provision
of wastewater treatment services to 2.2 million inhabitants in urban areas. Moreover, the new
financial policy and the institutional modernizationprogram proposed are expected to be applied
inseveral water utilities, which will obtainthe required support from FUNDASAB.
79.     Coordination with other donors. Coordination with other donors has been strong.
Preparation is undertaken in close cooperation with KfW and with coordination with the EU,
Sweden, Switzerland, IDB and others.
80.     Expected cost of policies. The main cost associated with implementing the reforms
during the SSPC program preparation is that of operationalizing FUNDASAB (several million
U S Dollars, to be provided by donors). The implementation of the reforms countrywide i s
associated with sector investments and amounts to about US$80 million per year.


                                         Social Protection
81.     Main issues. While poverty in Bolivia is widespread, specific groups have faced
particularly difficult times in taking advantage of market-based mechanisms and opportunities
created by economic growth or to benefit from social policies.              Especially worrisome
vulnerabilities relate to the chronic malnutrition and stunted development of young children,
insufficient education o f some groups of school age children, low income and employment
instability of a large proportion of poor workers, and lack of basic services for a considerable
proportion of families. These vulnerabilities are often transmitted to the next generation, helping
explain the perpetuation of poverty in some segments o f the population.
82.     The poor have very limited access to market-based or private mechanisms to cope with
risks and shocks, while income constraints prevent households from adequately self-protecting
against these shocks. The most prominent market-based mechanism available for the poor
population i s micro-credit through micro-finance institutions, although such mechanisms
generally do not reach the poorest households. Access o f the poor to market-based insurance
systems i s negligible. Only 14 percent of Bolivians have access to some kind o f credit, and in
case of severe negative shocks to their livelihoods only 3 percent of poor households borrow
from commercial organizations. Income constraints also prevent almost two-thirds of Bolivians



                                                 29

from developing some type of self-insurance and/or self-protection, such as savings or
portfolio/asset diversification.

83.     The primary policy implication of this analysis i s that, apart from additional economic
growth, Bolivia needs targeted interventions to support those articularly vulnerable groups. In
the past Bolivia has used a variety of safety net interventions1: ,which have grown impressively
over the last few years, and currently represent about 2.7 percent of the GDP in 2003 (one o f the
highest in Latin America), up from less than 1 percent in 1999. Two thirds of the social
protection expenditure in 2003 comprised three programs: the annuity paid to all Bolivians older
than 65 years of age (BONOSOL,)'3 the workfare program (PLANE), and other social funds-
related interventions (FIS-FPS). The remaining programs, currently more than 30 percent o f the
social protection expenditures, also have grown, from less than 0.6 percent o f the GDP in 1999
to more than 0.9 percent in 2003.
84.     Government strategy To design its social protection strategy, the Government initially
defined a set of priority policy areas of social protection interventions: protecting human capital
of infants and preschool children and smoothing consumption of families affected by low income
and unemployment. The strategy for setting these interventions seeks to complement current
structural social policies in education and health14, while addressing the main risks affecting
vulnerable groups.
85.     Actions supported by the SSPSAC I.The SSPSAC Isupported Government actions to
consolidate some key interventions like the PLANE and two additional actions to consolidate a
proper social protection policy in the medium term. First, in order to reconcile national and
municipal objectives to reach the MDGs, the Government defined a mechanism to encourage


12. Including workfare programs, direct transfers, early child development, social funds-related interventions,
    among others.
13. Even though BONOSOL i s not an insurance mechanism, it i s a unique feature o f the pension system in
    Bolivia. BONOSOL is a universal transfer to population older than 65 years of age, financed by income from
    previously state-owned enterprises, which has helped government to mitigate the impact of low coverage of the
    social security system.
14. Effectiveness of programs in a particular age group depends on interventions in another. For example,
    effectiveness of basic education programs (e.g., improve quality, reduce early drop out in first grade) depends,
    among other things, on effective interventions to prevent chronic malnutrition and stunting.

local governments to implement interventions directly related to the achievement of the MDGs.
To this effect, the Government, through the DUF (the central government agency in charge of
the social funds), reformulated part of the National Compensation Policy and designed the
conditional transfers to municipalities policy (PTC), based on a scheme of incentives through
matching grants. Second, the Government created a Social Protection Network (RPS) within the
DUF, to implement medium-term counter-cyclical interventions in a more systematic way, that
would expand and reduce their scope according to need, on the basis o f specific triggers and
measurable indicators. Initially, the RPS implementedtwo complementary programs: (i)                     a labor
intensive projects component in which the RPS would finance only labor costs (PLANE), and
(ii)smallprojectscomponentinwhichtheRPSwouldtransferresourcesforfinancingentire
    a
projects (PROPAIS).
86.     Actions supported by the SSPC 11. The SSPC I1i s supporting the implementation of
some actions within the framework of the social protection strategy.

Trigger (original): The Government has defined a national Social Protection Strategy that
includes, at least, the following components: (i)a conceptual social protection framework;
(ii)definitionofpopulationatriskandmainneeds; (iii)acleardefinitionofpriorities; (iv)
identification of main interventions; (v) budgetary requirements and investment timetable;
and (vi) a monitoring and evaluation system.

87.     Assessment: The Government met the trigger. The DUF and UDAPE coordinated the
design of a social protection strategy which includes a conceptual framework, identifies the main
vulnerable groups and risks, main priorities for intervention, assesses the current social
protection interventions in Bolivia and alternatives for improvement; and defines a set of
institutional arrangements to take decisions, coordinate implementation, and monitor and
evaluate social protection interventions. The strategy i s under implementation through selected
programs that will be evaluated inone year in order to make the necessary changes. Specifically,
    1. To reduce chronic malnutrition and improve the health status of children younger than
        five, the Government, through the MOH, has implemented a nutrition pilot program,
        described in the health section.
    2. The government through the DUF has implemented a policy of conditional transfers to
        municipalities (PTC) as part of the adjustment of the National Compensation Policy
        (PNC)." The first phase of the PTC emphasizes investments to reach the MDGs related
        to Children and Maternal Mortality. In order to implement the PTC the DUF and the
        M o H have signed an agreement, defined criteria to selected municipalities and allocate
        resources, and sent letters to municipalities inviting them to participate inthis process.
    3. To support poor workers to mitigate the negative effects o f high unemployment and
        consequent decreases in income, the government, through the RPS which i s fully
        operating, implemented the third phase of PLANE as a counter-cyclical public workfare
        program. The government i s committed to pay at least 200,000 one-month salaries in the
        period January 2004-June 2005 through this program.                     To accomplish this goal, the
        Ministry of Finance increased PLANE budget in about US$7 million early this year.


15. Since 2001, the government put in place the National Compensation Policy (PNC), a social fund-related
     program to finance sub-projects at municipal level. Under this policy, the social fund (FPS) coordinates with
     sector ministries to allocate resources on the basis of municipal UBN. A recent evaluation of the PNC has
     shown that a significant proportion of funds still reach non-poor communities.


                                                          31

        According to government projections, the most recent trends in open unemployment and
        GDPper capita growth are clear signs that demand for aprogram like PLANEmay fall in
        the near future. Therefore, the government has decided to phase out the program once the
        third phase is completed by the end of 2005. To do so, an exit strategy for beneficiaries
        of PLANEhas been adopted, based on training programs.
88.     All of these actions had been stated as benchmarks, but since they have become more
relevant to the overall government's program they are now being included in the trigger, which
has been revised and strengthened as follows:
Trigger (revised):     The Government has defined the general conceptual and technical
framework of the national social protection strategy that includes at least, the programs
supervised by the DUF (PNC, RPS, PLANE). The strategy include the following
components: (i)    definition of population at risk and main needs; (ii) clear definition of
                                                                           a
priorities; (iii)identification of main interventions; (iv) budgetary requirements and
investment timetable; and (v) a monitoring and evaluation system.
The Government has also begun implementation of key elements of the strategy through
the following activities:
    a) Designed and began implementing a nutrition plan in 25 priority municipalities to
        prevent chronic malnutrition and infant mortality (implementation agency:
        Ministry of Health).
    b) Extended PLANE within the fully operational RPS, to mitigate the effects of
        unemployment, generating 200,000 temporary jobs betweenJanuary 2004 and June
        2005.
    c) Began pilot implementation of the Conditional Transfer Policy that reallocates
        investment funds to municipalities for projects related to the achievement of MDGs
        inhealth, as partofthe changesto the PNC.



                     Participatory Monitoringand Evaluation of the MDGs
89.     Main Issues. In the last several years, Bolivia monitored several sets of social outcome
indicators, beginning with a set of indicators defined for HIPC Iin 1998 and continuing with
different sets for the annual Consultative Group meetings, for HIPC 11, and for Bolivia's PRSP.
As a result of this experience, Bolivia moved more quickly than most developing countries to
track the MDGs and, with the help of UNDP, by 2003 had produced two reports on progress on
MDGs in 2001 and 2002 at a time when most developing countries were in the process of
producing their first report. Nevertheless, by the time of the preparation of the SSPSAC I,    there
were some weaknesses apparent in the Government's approach.               The main weaknesses,
identified inthe SSPSAC Iproject document, were:

0   The lack of coordination among the monitoring systems used b y line ministries and by the
    National Institute of Statistics (INE) and UDAPE.
0   The lack o f availability of indicators at a disaggregated level, making it difficult to identify
    specific areas for service delivery improvement.
0   Limited access to information by citizens and civil society organizations, makingit difficult
    for them to track the delivery of public services and to provide feedback to the government
    on ways to improve those services.



                                                  32

    The absence of instruments to allow users of services to voice their opinion regarding the
    quality of the services they receive.
    The weak capacity to evaluate progress inthe indicators, makingit difficult to determine
    whether the policies directed towards achieving the MDGswere having their desired effect.
90.     While the Government and the Bank were aware of these weaknesses, the results of a
recent systematic cross-country review of statistical capacity now help put Bolivia's situation in
perspective. Bolivia's statistical capacity score was 58, which places it around the average of 60
for IDA-IBRD countries but considerably below the average for Latin America. A
disaggregation of the score i s revealing. Bolivia scores much higher than the IDA-IBRD average
on indicator availability (85 vs. 72), reflecting the recent history on tracking indicators. Where
Bolivia i s weakest i s on data collection with a score of 40 compared to the IDNIBRD average of
54. This i s mainly due to the limited resources of the National Statistical Institute.
91.     Government Strategy. In contrast to the other components of this project, no strategy
was initially in place to strengthen the monitoring and evaluation of MDGs. The series of
SSPSAC credits was designed with the Government to set out that strategy. The broad task of
strengthening monitoring and evaluation of MDGs was broken down into four more specific
areas which constitute the objectives of the policy matrix. The strategy i s to pursue the particular
actions set forth for SSPSAC I,   SSPC I1and 111so as to advance inthese four objectives. For the
first two credits, the emphasis is on designing the improvements and introducing changes to the
existing systems based on pilot experiences. In the third SSPSAC, the emphasis will be on
consolidating the gains and presenting a financing plan with some already-achieved results. The
idea will be to have this plan ready for the future, to capitalize on the international interest on
MDGs (and the results agenda in general) that will only be heightened by the upcoming MDG
conference in September 2005. Critical to the development and implementation of the strategy
has been the establishment of an Interinstitutional Committee for the MDGs. This was created
by Presidential Decree inMay 2004 (supported by the SSPSAC I) consists of technical staff
                                                                      and
in UDAPE, INE and the social sector ministries. The team has stayed intact despite several
rounds of cabinet changes and their work i s largely responsible for the advances that have been
achieved this year.
92.     Actions supported by the SSPSAC I.The SSPSAC-I supported the following actions:
(a) In order to increase access to information and accountability, the Government presented a
strategy for gathering and disseminating financial information at the municipal level in the areas
o f health, education, and water and sanitation, validated by the ministries of Popular
Participation and Finance. It also disseminated the 2003 financial execution of the central
government budget and those municipalities where it was available. In addition it published
information with financial indicators and coverage of basic services, separated by gender, ethnic
groups and other variables pertaining to the MDGs at the municipal level; it prepared
departmental reports with information on the execution of HIPC I1resources and indicators
related to the MDGs for health, education, and water and basic sanitation; and it included the
National Mechanism of Social Control in the board of directors of CISE. (b) In order to include
the opinion of beneficiaries in the evaluation of public interventions, the Government started
implementing a participative evaluation system of citizen report cards. (c) On the technical
issues related to monitoring and evaluation of MDGs, the Government started to develop a
strategy for the technical evaluation of the achievement of the MDGs, including the
conformation of an inter-sectoral technical committee, the preliminary identification of
objectives, goals and indicators, and the definition of a work plan to achieve the strategy.


                                                   33

93.     Actions supported by the SSPC 11. The Government has made substantial progress in
all four categories of prior actions and progress indicators.
(Trigger): A strategy is in place for the technical evaluation of the progress in the
achievement of the MDGs and discussions of the results achieved by far have been held
with civil society and the international cooperation.
94.     Assessment. This trigger was fully met.          The strategy i s described in a working
document of the Inter-institutionalCommittee and may be briefly summarized as follows. First,
the historical trends and variation across municipalities in the behavior of each 17 indicators are
tracked and analyzed, to the extent that data permit. Second, the policies and programs in place
that support the achievement of the indicator are identified. Third, two scenarios are created -
one assuming that the policies and programs continue in line with their past trends and a second
optimistic scenario, assuming progress in overcoming bottlenecks, both financial and technical.
Finally, the two scenarios are compared and the results are presented for discussion within the
Government, with the international cooperation and with civil society.
95.     The first two reports on progress in the MDGs for 2001 and 2002 analyzed historical
tendencies in the indicators, but did not attempt to explicitly identify all the policies and
programs that affect the progress in the indicator. The evidence that the strategy i s in place and
i s being implemented i s provided by the third report for Progress in the MDGs up to 2003, which
brings in much more information on the policies and programs that are in place that would be
expected to affect the path of the indicators.
96.     In parallel, the Government and the World Bank are working on computer simulation
models that make the links between policies and programs on one side, and the MDG indicators
on the other. A successful pilot has been completed in malaria that explicitly links the 19
different actions under the control of the government that together influence the evolution of the
Annual Parasitic Index API. This work will now be mainstreamed into the planningprocess in
malaria with the participation of the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Finance. This same
general approach i s now being developed for the case of maternalmortality and, if it proves to be
useful, would be extended to some of the other 17 indicators.
97.     The Government i s discussing the progress in the MDGs with the international
cooperation and civil society. Workshops were held in May and June 2004 with UDAPE and
INE staff, research institutions and donor agencies, 157 representatives of 47 NGOs working in
the social sectors, five NGO networks working in the productive sector and nine international
NGOs, leaders of grass roots organizations, including the leading indigenous organizations in the
different departments of the country. The objective was to disseminate information on the
MDGs, the progress that Bolivia made to achieve them and ongoing initiatives and institutions
working towards attaining the goals and the potential role of civil society organizations in the
attainment of MDGs.
(Trigger) The Government has started the system of follow-up and participative evaluation
of the MDGs and has reports which are shared with other instances of governmental
oversight.
98.     Assessment. This trigger was substantially met. The Government reviewed alternative
instrumentsand chose to apply the approach of Citizen Report Cards, which were introduced in
Bangalore, India and successfully applied in other countries. Workshops with experts in the
approach were held and a concept document for its application inBolivia was developed. Terms


                                                   34

of reference were developed for the system to be implementedb y independent NGOs, proposals
were reviewed and the winner was selected. However, the procurement process took longer than
expected and the contract has only recently been signed and the initial field work begun. The
final reports are due August 15th. Thus, while there has been a careful, measured approach to
developing the instrument and there i s little risk that the product will not be produced, there has
been a delay from the original plan, which accounts for the rating of substantially rather than
completely fulfilled. However, this delay will not affect the ability to achieve the goal set forth
in SSPC 111, namely to allow social services to take into account in a systematic manner the
opinions of the beneficiaries of the services as inputs for its development.
99.     Benchmarks. The progress inthe benchmarks has been as follows:

0   With regards to the further development of a transparent system of public financial
    information (SIGMA), the Government has continued to maintain financial information on
    its web site. In addition, the Ministry of Finance has recently developed and discussed with
    the international cooperation its Strategic Framework for Strengthening Public Finances,
    which seeks to integrate the budget with the financing program and development and poverty
    reduction strategies; and improve the quality of public expenditure.
    As part of this effort to strengthen public finances, it will be important to make
    improvements to the existing integrated financial management system (SIGMA).                  A
    December 2004 IMF assessment concluded that the systemic weaknesses in SIGMA
    identified in the June 2004 CFAA had deteriorated even further due to delays in
    implementing technical recommendations.          The Bank, IMF and IDB teams working on
    public sector management and reform agreed that the technical recommendations of the
    CFAA must be carried out and completed prior to any expansion of SIGMA to
    municipalities.    These recommendations included a series of studies to evaluate the
    investment and technical needs to modernize the system. For this reason, a prior action was
    added for SSPC I1that the evaluation be initiated and a benchmark for SSPC IIIwas added
    related to the application of the recommendations of that evaluation.

    While this process takes place, the most feasible means of bringing information about the
    budget to the general public i s through the dissemination o f studies on public expenditure.
    This past year the Government, together with the World Bank and the IDB, carried out an
    unprecedented (for Bolivia) public dissemination campaign of the joint WB/IDB Public
    Expenditure Review (PER). This consisted of: a) workshops in L a Paz, Cochabamba and
    Santa Cruz with lawmakers, NGOs, universities, professional associations, indigenous and
    campesino organizations, representatives of municipal governments, citizen oversight
    committees and the private sector; and b) extensive dissemination in the national press. In
    the near future, there will be a publication intended to make the results of the PER more
    accessible for the general public (Le. a PER for non-economists), a multimedia CD and 2
    minute radio programs in Aymara, Quechua and Guarani on the principal messages of the
    PER.

    Regarding the integration of statistical information to track MDGs, over the last year the
    inter-institutional committee has moved to resolve the confusion caused by the legacy of past
    initiatives to track indicators. There i s now a single set of indicators, closely matching the
    MDGs, but with some customization for the particular concerns and situation of Bolivia.
    Progress has also been made in the coordination between the sector ministries and INE and

                                                  35

    UDAPE on the indicators. INE and the sectoral ministries have signed inter-ministerial
    agreements to strengthen the sectoral systems of information. As part of that effort, INEhas
    producedpopulation estimates by year for different ages at the municipal level, which will be
    used to provide consistent estimates of coverage rates. INE has also presented departmental
    reports of indicators of health, education and water and sanitation with information further
    disaggregated for municipalities that integrate information from the household surveys (such
    as the Demographic and Health Surveys) and the National System of Health Information and
    National Information System in Education, managed by the line ministries. Other examples
    of integration are in the production of maps of coverage in education and health which
    combine census data and administrativedata within a geographical information system.

100. Expectedoutcomes of the policies. The expected outcome of this component will be to
have a better informational and analytical base to select the policies to achieve the MDGs.
However, the monitoring and evaluation of the MDGs alone will not guarantee that the MDGs
would be achieved. This requires a broad set of actions including considerations o f incentives,
methods and levels of financing and, undoubtedly, changes in the practices of both government
ministries and the international cooperation to allow greater priorization, improved
harmonization and stronger emphasis on results. The responsibility of the Inter-institutional
Committee on MDGs goes beyond the task of improving the monitoring and evaluation o f the
MDGs. They have the responsibility to provide policy recommendations on actions that would
contribute to more successful achievement of the MDGs. However, they are a technical group
and do not have the power to take political decisions. Their policy recommendations would be
submitted for consideration by the National Council o f Economic and Social Policy (CONAPES)
that would have the power to take the necessary decisions.
101. Expected costs of the policies. The cost of designing the improvements and introducing
the changes are manageable with existing sources. However, fully implementing the system to
scale will require considerably more resources than are currently assigned to the task. Currently,
the entire budget for INE i s US$3.3 million, with US$1.5 million provided by the Treasury and
US$1.8 million by the international cooperation. This represents only 0.5 percent of the public
investment budget. The $1.8 million provided by the international cooperation represents 0.2
percent of the roughly $670 million provided per year. In terms of the overall consolidated
public sector budget of roughly US$5 billion, the share i s miniscule. O f course, LNE is not the
only actor whose activities are important in generating a results orientation, but it i s clearly one
of the most important actors.
102.    B y the time of the SSPC 11, the Government will have a clear idea of the costs required to
implement an adequate system. Preliminary indications suggest that this might involve tripling
INE's budget to roughly US$10 million a year. While this might appear to be a dramatic
increase, the figures presented above would indicate that this would still be a very modest sum
spent to try to ensure that the remaining 98 percent or so of the resources are generating an
impact.

                           VI.     OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

POVERTYAND SOCIALIMPACTS6
103.    Povertyimpact. Ingeneral the SSPCI1supports changes inprograms that are already in
place in order to increase coverage of basic social services and reduce inequality in access across
geographic areas, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups.             Therefore it i s not foreseen that the
activities implemented under this operation will have a negative distributional impact or face
opposition by the majority of the Bolivian society. Also, the SSPC 11i s not expected to have a
direct impact on income poverty, as its objective i s not to improve income generation among the
poor but to improve social services so that they become more easily available to the poor. The
only exception refers to the social protection component, which i s supporting a workfare
program that should alleviate poverty but only on a temporary basis.
104.     Benefits for indigenous peoples. In assisting the government to set up policies to
reduce the unequal access to social services across regions and socioeconomic groups, it i s
expected that the indigenous will benefit from these actions, being one of the groups with less
access to health and education services. Specifically in the case of health, the government i s
taking some steps to include culturally diverse groups into its health care system, by issuing a
ministerial resolution that incorporates traditional doctors and midwives into the national health
system, and adapting some health facilities to traditional methods of childbirth. Lastly, SUM1
and the nutrition plan for at-risk municipalities will include communication activities indifferent
indigenous languages.
105.    Inthe case of education, the approaches designed to benefit indigenous peoples from
education policies are twofold: (i)     Intercultural Bilingual Education (Educacidn Intercultural
Bilingiie - Em),consisting of teaching children to read and write first in their native language
and only then introducing Spanish; and (ii)       indigenous education popular participation forums.
Although it does not explicitly support conditionalities targeted specifically to indigenous
education, the SSPC I1will support three lines of action in these areas. The first i s the inclusion
of a bilingual strategy in the new secondary school curriculum. The second i s the participatory
elaboration of the new education strategy. This will allow the different indigenous participation
forums an opportunity to define the policies that will affect their future. Finally, the support for
reduction of inequalities in completion, while focused on girls, i s also focused on rural and
indigenous areas, which i s where girls are at a disadvantage.
106.    The SSPC 11,through the participatory monitoring component, i s devising changes to the
different information systems to be able to track progress towards achieving MDGs
disaggregated by ethnicity. The upcoming report on MDGs for 2004, which will be published in
2005, will disaggregate education indicators by ethnicity, and currently the government i s
working on this idea with the health and water and sanitation sectors.
107.    This course of action is validated by a recent regional study on indigenous people (World
Bank 2004). The study argues that there are four main policy actions that could improve the
welfare of indigenous groups: first, there i s a need for more and better education, accompanied
with efforts to decrease the gap in years of schooling and improving the quality of education
through such programs as bilingualhicultural education. Second, there i s a need to promote

equal opportunities through maternal and child health interventions. Third, there needs to be
improved accountability in the delivery of social services. Finally, even though there are many
sources of information on indigenous peoples' well-being, there i s an urgent need to improve
data collection efforts related to identifying indigenous populations and tracking outcomes.
These four recommendations are followed through in many o f the activities supported b y the
SSPC II.
SUPERVISION

108.   In order to facilitate supervision of the activities under the SSPC series, the Government
and the World Bank agreed on a set of intermediate actions. These actions are not legally
binding, and specify progress indicators by quarter that will allow the Bank teams to better assess
the progress in implementing the benchmarks in the Policy Matrix. The Government relies on
VIPFE and UDAPE to monitor progress in the program, and has agreed to prepare a quarterly
progress report that will be used as basis for supervision missions.

PARTICIPATION
109. Bolivia has followed an impressive participatory approach to define its medium term
strategy for development. Even though the SSPC Series was not mentioned specifically in the
context of the national dialogue that involved almost 70,000 representatives of different groups
of the Bolivian society, the policies supported in this operation take into account the conclusions
of such dialogue. The participation of civil society in government decisions has been very
explicitly adopted by Bolivia, particularly after the events o f October 2003 (see section on
Political context).      A new National Dialogue was convened by the end of 2003, with the
objective to set up a new strategy for development that includes the voice of many different
actors in civil society. This process finished by the end of 2004 and fostered the participation of
almost 70,000 representatives of NGOs, municipal and departmental government, and other
representatives of society.
 110. Eventhough it was a very successful process, the Dialogue raised some concerns, like the
varying degrees of participation of different groups due to the heterogeneity in the level of
information and knowledge of the different actors, and the relative weakness of the
methodological proposal. The discussions veered towards issues outside the original areas of
discussion, like defaulting on the external debt, redistribution of HIPC resources, and other
issues over which there was no mandate to discuss.
FIDUCIARYASPECTS
 111. The 2004 joint World Bank-IDB CFAA assessedBolivia's public financial management
 (PFM) systems, practices, and accountability mechanisms.                    The legal framework governing
Bolivia's PFM, built around the 1990 law for financial administration (SAFCO) i s considered
 sound.l7 Bolivia's integrated system of financial administration, SIGMA, has improved public
financial management in the central government, however the CFAA (as well as a recent IMF
 assessment team) identified a number of systemic weaknesses that threaten the long term
 sustainability of the system. The system i s currently burdened with outdated technology to
 support increasing user demand and often i s not able to process transactions due to a high

 17. In addition to the SAFCO Law, the laws of Popular Participation and Decentralization are important pillars of
    the modernization of the legal framework. These laws have established the relationship between government
     and civil society and also dispersed power from central administration to the department and municipal levels.

number of users. Also, it does not have adequate backup systems to safeguard government
financial data, posing a serious potential risk to the integrity of government finances. The Bank
i s working closely with the government to carryout a series of technical studies that will
determine the level of investments needed to modernize and safeguard the system, and propose
alternative solutions if the estimated investments costs are prohibitive.
 112.     The Contraloria de la Repu'blica(CGR) meets the criteria of being a national audit body
that i s independent of the executive, providing timely reports for the legislature and public on the
financial integrity of government accounts. As a result of the peer review assessment of June
2002, the CGR was the first public entity in Bolivia and the only Supreme Audit Lnstitution
(SAI)   '* in  Latin America to receive the I S 0 9002/94 certifi~ation.'~However, the lack of
permanent leadership undermines the credibility and authority of the CGR within government.
 113.     Despite these general advances, there i s still a strong culture of informality inBolivia that
pervades public sector management. The CFAA showed that:
    There are still a great number of variations, reallocations and adjustments without proper
    authorization, and the budget does not provide resources in a predictable or transparent
    manner.        As such, current expenditure management practice allows for unrestrained
    opportunistic spending.20
    SIGMA needs to be rolled out to the entire central government, notjust the limited segment
    that currently uses it; this would include prefectures, state owned enterprises and to the
    appropriate decentralized governments.
    The financial management framework for municipalities i s generally sound. The main
    shortcomings in financial reporting relate to a lack of capacity to generate financial
    information and weaknesses with regardto internal controls and audit.21
 114.     The final CFAA report includes a detailed government designed action plan to address
these and other issues, which will have been discussed with the government and other major
stakeholders. Additionally, the action plan also incorporates similar recommendations of the
August 2004 IMF-World Bank HIPC Assessment (the CFAA and HIPC Assessment teams had
worked in close alignment to ensure consistency in analyses). Due to numerous changes in the
administration the implementation of the action plan i s still in an infancy stage. However, in
order to ensure that these reforms produce meaningful results and impact, a series of parallel
technical assistance activities must also be carried out in order to establish an improved
governance environment.
 115.     A prerequisite of the proposed reform is the commitment of most senior level of
government to implement the necessary change to the public sector culture. To this end, the
President, in 2004, had issued two important pieces of legislation:                     "Proyecto de Ley de

Transparencia" (Decreto Supremo No. 27329) and "Proyecto de Ley de Acceso a la
Znformacidn" These two bills, which were developed inconsultation with Civil Society, aim not
only to improve the frequency and quality of public sector financial reporting, but to also ensure
full public access to government financial data. To further support the government's efforts,
support will need to be provided to the newly created Inter-Agency Peer review Board. This
board serves to help public agencies improve its internal controls and governance/accountability
practices. The Board could also serve as the forum to review and implement internal audit
reports findings and recommendations.
116.    Additionally, support should be provided at the sector level, particularly through donor
coordinated harmonized efforts that pay particular attention to the application of rules and
regulations for expenditure management (from planning to execution to monitoring and
evaluation). With the current desire to develop Sector-Wide Approaches (SWAPS), compliance
with existing frameworks should be closely monitored in addition to funding earmarked to assist
sector ministries with budget implementation.
DISBURSEMENTAND AUDITING

117.    The IMF Safeguards Assessment of the Central Bank of Bolivia (BCB) concluded that
the control environment, procedures and regulations governing the bank's operations and
management of foreign exchange are generally adequate. The Bank will disburse the credit
proceeds into an account of the BCB denominated in USD. The BCB will immediately credit
the disbursed amounts to the Ministry of Finance's Single Treasury Account, thus becoming
available to finance budgeted expenditures. Within a week of the disbursement, the Ministry
will accordingly provide the Bank written confirmation of the transaction. If, after deposit in the
BCB, credit proceeds are not treated as described above, the Bank will require the Government
to promptly refund the disallowed amount.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS22
118.    Following OP8.60, the team considered whether the operation has any relevant aspects
for the environment, forest and natural resources. The two areas where a potential effect on the
environment could be present are health and water and sanitation. While some of the proposed
actions are related to the health system, they do not have, directly or indirectly, an environmental
effect, since they focus on the institutional arrangements between central and local governments,
and improving the nutritional status of mothers and children through behavioral changes and
adequate communications.
119.    With respect to the water and sanitation actions, since the SSPC I1i s promoting the
adoption of a financial policy that will increase coverage of water and sewerage systems, its
impact will be positive, as this expansion will be done following strict environmental codes with
the creation of the FUNDASAB, an entity that will provide technical assistance to providers of
water and sanitation services inthe country.
120.    It i s foreseen that the implementation of the policies designed under the proposed
operation would result in execution of increased investment in water supply and sanitation
projects in the country, increased coverage of the services, increase in water flows provided to

     discussed duringthe ProgramDocumentConcept Review meeting.

the population and, consequently, increase in wastewater flows generated in the country. That
would entail adequate environmental management so as to prevent negative impacts. In small
and medium cities the environmental impact will be minimal and restricted to effects expected
during the execution of small works like installation of small diameter water and sewerage
networks and the construction of small wastewater treatment plants. The environmental impact
i s limited and can easily be mitigated by instructing the constructors to use appropriate working
methods and mitigation measures. With respect to large cities, in L a PazE1 Alto the water
supply systems are already inplace. Only minor extension works are needed, most of them inEl
Alto, and their impact will be minimal, similar to the impact of works in small and medium
cities. Wastewater treatment works, if constructed, might have major environmental impacts
which would need to be properly addressed.            In Cochabamba, the wastewater treatment
installation, if constructed, might have an environmental impact that would need to be properly
addressed. However the SSPC IIi s not providing specific financing for this activity. In Santa
Cruz, the most significant environmental impact i s that of not taking any action with regards to
its sewerage system. Sewerage networks need to be built to expand coverage to all parts of the
city and to expand the capacity of the existing two wastewater treatment plants.               The
construction of the sewerage networks within the city will have an impact during construction,
but this is not a major impact and it can be well mitigated. The expansion of the capacity of the
treatment plants will have minor environmental impacts, if appropriate technology will be used
to upgrade the plants.
121.     The proposed water and sanitation policy incorporates mechanisms to mitigate negative
environmental effects. First, a series of norms and regulations have been enacted in Bolivia for
proper design and construction of water and wastewater installations (conveyance, treatment and
distribution of water, as well as collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater). In addition,
every water and sanitation project needs to be accompanied by an environmental assessment
study. As mentioned, one of the pillars of the policy applied under this operation is the
establishment of the FUNDASAB, which would provide technical assistance to the water and
sanitation utilities and to the sector entities. One of the fields of this TA i s environmental
management and mitigation of negative impacts. FUNDASAB i s therefore an important
mechanism which will support the mitigation of potential negative environmental effects in the
sector. The main negative impact in the sector i s the generation of wastewater which requires
adequate treatment and disposal. Bolivia has a proven track record in that field in the sense that
the percentage of wastewater which undergoes treatment in relation to the amount of wastewater
generated in the country i s higher than that of most countries in Latin America, and will continue
to increase as a result of the proposed operation.



RISKSAND RISK MITIGATION

122.     During the preparation of the SSPSAC Ithree types of risks were identified which are
still present in the current context:     country risks, implementation risks, and design risks.




                                                 41

Country Risks
123.   Political and social risks: The main risks that the country faces are on the socio-political
side. The country's political situation has been fragile since the departure of ex-President
Sanchez de Losada in late 2003, and improvement inthe short term i s unlikely. President Carlos
Mesa, a political outsider, has limited ability to control the political agenda. Opposition groups
have been using street protests and blockades as a means to force concessions from the
Government, in particular on issues related to the proposed Hydrocarbon Law, water services in
El Alto, domestic fuel prices, and regional autonomy for the lowland area of Santa Cruz.
Currently, final resolution regarding the Hydrocarbons Law is the most important issue driving
political and social uncertainty. This law i s attempting to increase government revenues from
gas and hydrocarbons without violating the terms of the contracts with the foreign companies
that have invested inthe sector and damaging the investment climate.
124.   Concomitantly, social divisions throughout the country continue to be present. The most
important of these relates to the growing activism of indigenous groups, particularly the cocalera
groups led by Evo Morales and a number of highland Aymara indigenous communities led by
Felipe Quispe. The wealthy agro-industry region of Santa Cruz, in the lowlands near the
Brazilianborder, i s further polarizing the country by pushingfor increasing autonomy.
125.   Mitigating political and social risks: Inthe face of such a difficult political panorama, the
Government has made concerted efforts to address the demands of protesters without resorting to
the use of force. This has at times meant a retreat from its plannedpolicies, as was the case with
Aguas del Zllimani in El Alto and conceding a future referendum on regional autonomy. But
beyond measures to address immediate crises, the Government has worked to develop and
strengthen new mechanisms for popular political participation, such as the National Dialogue
(which helped design the Government's overall policy strategy for the future), a new
Constitutional Assembly which i s expected to meet either this year or next to overhaul Bolivia's
Constitution, and congresses on sectoral issues such as the POMA for education policy. This
strategy holds out the possibility of channeling popular discontent into institutions that can reach
some kind of consensus on long-term policies to be implemented regardless o f future political
events. The Bank and the international community have vigorously supported these efforts and
will continue to do so wherever appropriate.
126.   This operation itself is a mitigating factor for political and social risks. It demonstrates
the Government's commitment to improving social services, especially those directed toward
poor and marginalized groups. By using participatory mechanisms in designing some of the
policies and evaluating results, it promotes the inclusion of different social groups in
governmental institutions. Beyond this operation, the Bank i s providing technical information to
the Government from international experience that can help design a Hydrocarbon Law that both
provides maximum benefit from the exploitation o f this valuable natural resource to the Bolivian
people, while at the same time establishing the conditions to continue attracting much needed
private investment in the sector. Further, the Bank i s supporting Government projects improving
social services (especially health services) inElAlto - a focus of opposition to the Government -
and is also preparing a rural development project for the Chapare region, home to most of
Bolivia's coca growers.
127.   Economic risks: Although economic growth has been relatively solid in the past two
years - 3.8 percent GDP growth on average in 2003-04 - the economy remains vulnerable to
external and internal shocks. On the external front, a decline in commodity prices (particularly


                                                 42

soya) would hurt exports, and an increase in U.S. interest rates could slow regional growth,
lowering demand for Bolivia's export products. Internally, social unrest i s already having a
negative impact on the economy through road blockades and other disruptions which hinder
production and make the country less attractive to private investment. General agricultural
exports declined over 40 percent between January 2004 and January 2005, according to official
sources, largely because of road blockades and strikes. Further social unrest and declines inbank
profitability has the potential to trigger a crisis in the banking sector. Further, the Government's
debt level i s rising, andthe fiscal deficit i s high.
128.    Mitigating economic risks: The Government i s taking a number of steps to mitigate
economic risks. Fiscal policy i s gradually being brought under control and the public debt being
put on a sustainable path. Both foreign exchange and monetary policy have been managed with
prudence such that Bolivia has avoided significant currency and inflation volatility. The country
has a SBA with the IMF, and i s complying with its targets. With the Bank's assistance, the
Government i s working to accelerate the restructuring of the corporate sector and increasing
oversight of the financial sector. Further, the Bank has recently completed a Poverty Assessment
and will soon complete a Country Economic Memorandum that focus on how to reactivate and
diversify economic activity to promotejob creation and poverty reduction.
129.    Implementationrisks:These are mostlyderived from the country's risks. Specific risks
are related to: (i) stakeholder resistance to new policies; (ii) o f progress in key participatory
                                                                lack
processes (such i s the case in the education sector) and (iii)  institutional weaknesses. Overall,
the implementation risks apply to those policies and actions included as benchmarks to move
forward with the third phase of the program, since for the second Credit policy actions will be
complied with prior to Board presentation. The other implementation risk i s related to the
potential change in government officials that may be the aftermath of the current political crisis.
A change in officials could delay implementation of some of the policies contained inthe Policy
Matrix. Mitigating actions are being put ineffect, such as providing for ample participation from
citizens and the international community, securing needed technical assistance for specific tasks
and strengthening monitoring and evaluation capacity. In this case a DPC is also a mitigating
activity, as it provides a framework and basis for continuity o f policies in case of ministerial
changes. In fact the new Ministers o f Health and of Popular Participation, and the President of
the DUFhave embraced and are supporting the policies includedinthe SSPC II.
130.    Design risks: there is a possibility that the actions proposed in this program will not
address and overcome the key obstacles to reaching the MDGs.                  The program may be
overlooking key policy actions needed to accelerate progress, or including others that may not
contribute much towards progress on the social agenda. This design risk has been carefully
addressed during preparation by the Government and the project preparation team through a
detailed discussion on how to reach the best combination between (a) current knowledge on best
approaches to achieving the desired social outcomes and (b) what i s politically and technically
feasible in the current country's context. There i s significant amount o f analytical work that has
been produced during the last two years and has been instrumental in the preparation of this
operation. In addition, periodic revisions of results obtained will enable to introduce changes as
needed.

I.EVALUACI~NMACROECON~MICA

Datos preliminares sehalan que durante 2004 la economia boliviana crecio en 3,6%, tasa mas
alta desde el inicio de la declinacion del ritmo de actividad economica en 1999. El crecimiento
del PIB per capita de 1,3% (descontando el aumento de la poblacion) revierte la tendencia de
10s5 ultimos atios, que registro tasas negativasy cercanas a cero.

De acuerdo a informacion disponible para el tercer trimestre de 2004, el crecimiento del PlB
continuo siendo explicado por el dinamismo de la demanda externa, sin embargo se observo
una recuperacionde la demanda interna. En un context0 de austeridad fiscal, el crecimiento de
la demanda interna se explica por el crecimientodel consumo privado y por la recuperacion de
la inversion publica.

Los sectores mas dinamicos hasta septiembre de 2004 fueron: petroleo crudo y gas natural
(32,3%), transporte y almacenamiento (4,0%) e industria manufacturera(4,1/.). Por otra parte,
10s sectores que presentaron un crecimiento bajo fueron: agropecuaria (0,6%) y construccion
(1,lo/.). Los sectores que tuvieron variaciones negativas importantes fueron: minerales
metalicosy no metalicos (-9,lO/O) y serviciosfinancieros (-7,570).

La inflacion acumulada a diciembre de 2004 alcanzo al 4,62%, mayor a la registrada en el
aRo 2003 (3,94%). El incremento en el ritmo inflacionario se atribuye tanto a factores internos
como externos. Entre 10s internos destacan: i) escasez de diesel que introdujo distorsiones en
la determinacion de tarifas del transporte interdepartamentaly; ii) factores climaticos (sequias
en el oriente del pais registradas en 10s ultimos meses de 2004) que causaron problemas de
abastecimiento en 10s mercados urbanos provocando incrementos en 10s precios de la carne
vacuna y productos similares ocasionando un aumento en la inflacion acumulada entre
septiembre y octubre, pasando de 2,60h a 3,43% entre ambos meses.

Entre 10sfactores externos que incidieronen la inflacion, se destaca la depreciacion acumulada
del tip0 de cambio nominal a diciembre de 2004 que alcanzo a 2,81%, menor a la registrada en
similar period0de 2003 (4.53%). El ritmo de depreciacionfue causado en parte por la evolucion
de la inflacioninternacional, en consecuencia, la inflacion general fue afectada parcialmente por
la tendencia creciente en 10s precios internacionales.

En el sector externo, las exportaciones de bienes y servicios no factoriales aumentaron en
35,3% y 9,6%, respectivamente; y las importaciones de bienes se incrementaron en 15,7%.
Este comportamiento permitio un superavit comercial que posibilito, a su vez, lograr un
superavit en la Cuenta Corriente. La evolucion favorable del comercio exterior se explica por la
coyuntura internacional que permitio exportar mayores volumenes de produccion nacional a
mejores precios; a su vez, la reactivacion de la actividad internay de la demanda final promovio


                                                 46

mayores importaciones tanto de bienes de capital e insumos como de bienes finales. Por otra
parte, se observo una expansion importante en las ventas de gas natural al Brasil y el
restablecimientode exportacionesde este energetic0 a la RepliblicaArgentina.

La buena gestion en el comercio exterior tambien fue coadyuvada por la depreciacion real del
tip0 de cambio multilateral en casi 6%, como resultado de la estabilizacion de la situacion
cambiaria a nivel regional, luego de 10sproblemasde las monedasde Argentina y Brasil.

En la Balanza de Pagos se logro un superavit de $us 166 millones luego de 10s deficits
observados principalmente en el period0 de crisis 2001-2002. Este superavit se explica por el
saldo positivo de la Cuenta Corriente, por la relativa mejora del superavit en Cuenta Capital y
Financiera, que entre 2004 y 2003, crecio en 8,6% y por la reduccion de desembolsos por
endeudamiento publico. El resultado en la Balanza de Pagos genero un aumento en el flujo de
Reservas lnternacionalesNetas de $us 77.4 millones en 2003 a $us123 millones en 2004.

En el sector financiero, se observo la recuperacion de 10s niveles de depositos y cartera a
partir del segundo semestre del aAo 2004. Un hecho destacable es la disminucion, en cinco
puntos porcentuales, de la participacion de 10s depositos del pljblico en dolares americanos.
Las entidades de intermediacion financiera enfrentaron menores niveles de mora y han
continuado con sus politicas de constitucion de previsiones a fin de mantener su solidez. La
participacion relativa de las entidades no bancarias en el sistema financiero, especialmente las
microfinancieras ha continuado incrementandose.

La polifica monefaria se ha orientado principalmente al control de la inflation y proveer la
liquidez adecuada a la economia, a traves de las ventanillas de reporto y 10s creditos de
liquidezdel fondo RAL.

En 2004 la politicafiscal estuvo orientada a contener el crecimiento del deficit y cubrir la brecha
fiscal necesaria para alcanzar la meta de deficit fiscal de 6,8% del PIB. De esta manera, se
ejecuto un programa de austeridad fiscal, se aprobo la Ley del lmpuesto a las Transacciones
Financieras (ITF) y se dio continuidad al Programa Transitorio Voluntario Excepcional (PTVE).
Estas medidas permitieron realizar una reprogramacion del deficit fiscal, estableciendose como
meta 6.0% del PIB; habiendo finalizado la gestion con un porcentaje de 5.7% del PIB, lo que
represento un ajuste fiscal de 2.4 puntos porcentuales del PIB con respecto al deficit de 2003.

Si se excluye el gasto por concept0 de reforma de pensiones, el deficit global en 2004 es de
0.9% del PIB. Por otra parte, si se toma como indicador el balance primario, que no incluye
intereses de la deuda, se registraria un deficit de 2.9% del PIB disminuyendo el deficit primario
en 2.5 puntos porcentualesdel PIB respecto a 2003.

En el marco de austeridad, se establecieron niveles maximos de remuneraciones, el gasto
corriente se redujo en 5%, 10s gastos reservados en 58% y 10s gastos de estudios e
investigaciones en 10%. Adicionalmente, se dispuso la supresion de 10s items acefalos del
Programade Reforma lnstitucional (PRI), se restringio el us0 de telefonia celular, de vehiculos
automotores y de combustible y se fijaron limites en las partidas de "servicios personaled' y

En cuanto a1 Programa de Regularizacion Impositiva, se amplio el plazo para que las personas
naturales y/o juridicas puedan beneficiarse del mismo. Tambien se aprob6 la ampliacion para la

OdikltFiscal del Sector Publico No Financier0 (SPNF)

En 2004, las operaciones del SPNF, registraron un deficit de 5.7% del PIB inferior en 2.4 puntos
porcentuales del PIB al registrado en 2003, debido a la generacion de mayores ingresos
tributarios. El 74% del deficit fiscal fue financiado con recursos externos provenientes de
organismos multilateralescomo la Corporacion Andina de Foment0 (CAF), Banco Mundial (BM) y
Banco lnteramericanode Desarrollo (BID); el restante 26% se financio con recursos internos, en
particular, mediante la emision de bonos a las Aseguradoras de Fondos de Pensiones (AFPs),
Letrasy Bonosde Tesoreria y la emisionde certificadosfiscales.

Los ingresos totales de la gestion 2004 fueron superiores en 2.7 puntos porcentuales del PIB
respecto a la gestion 2003, debido a mayores ingresos tributarios generados principalmente por
10s siguientes factores: i) la regularizacionde adeudos tributarios en renta interna, aduanera y
municipal, que superaron las expectativas iniciales, ii) las mayores utilidades que genero el
sector petrolero en 2003, conjuntamente el cobro del IT a la venta interna de petroleo, gas

natural y sus derivados'; iii) la implementaciondel ITF a partir de julio de 2004; y iv) la mayor
exportacion de gas natural al Brasil y las exportaciones adicionales de gas a la Republica
Argentina.

Los gasfos fofales del SPNF,sin considerar pensiones, se mantuvieronen niveles similares a la
gestion 2003. Los gasfos corrienfesfueron inferiores en 0.7 puntos porcentualesdel PIB como
consecuencia de la aplicacion de 10s Decretos de Austeridad Fiscal; mientras que la inversion
pliblica fue superior en alrededor un punto porcentual del PIB, atribuible a la mayor ejecucion
de programas y proyectos de inversion en el sector de infraestructura, principalmente por la
construccionde carreteras.

El gasto en pensiones es una de las partidas mas elevadas de 10s egresos del gobierno,
representando4,8% del PIB, porcentaje ligeramente inferior al registrado en la gestion 2003. El
costo de pensiones es el resultado de las politicasaplicadas en aios anteriores como: reduction
de edad de jubilacion, renta minima de Bs 850, indexacion de las rentas a la UFV, entre las
principales.

La inversion pliblica ejecutada en 2004 alcanzo a $us 601.6 millones, cifra superior en 20.4%
respecto al monto reportado en el aRo 2003 ($us 499.8 millones), pasando de 6.4% del PIB a

el porcentaje de ejecucion mas elevado del period0 2000 - 2004, alcanzando una proporcion
7.2% entre ambas gestiones. Debe mencionarse que en el afio 2004, la inversion publica logro

de 120.2%en comparacion a 78.0% de la gestion2003.

La    inversion publica 2004 se concentro principalmente en programas y proyectos de

Acuedo con elFond0 Monetariolntemacional (FMI'

El acuerdo Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) con el FMI fue aprobado el 2 de abril de 2003. En
2004 se suscriben dos Memorandums de                              Politicas Economicas y Financieras,
correspondientes a la tercera y cuarta modificacion al acuerdo SBA original. En la tercera
revision al SBA, la meta de deficit fiscal se redujo a 6,1% del PIB despues de donacionesy se
aumento el nivel del gasto pro-pobrea O,6% del PIB. En la cuarta revision ai SBA, se constata
que las metas del primer semestre fueron alcanzadas, a excepcion de las reservas
internacionales netasy activos netosdel BCB.

Para fines de 2004, la economia presenta signos de recuperacion con un crecimientodel 3,6%
del PIB, el aumento de 10s ingresos publicos y la reduccion de 10s gastos, resultados que
posibilitaron el cumplimientode las metasacordadas para la gestion analizada. Se logro reducir
el deficit fiscal, ya que se alcanzo un porcentaje de 5,7% del PIB, 0,4% menor a la prevision
establecida en el programa fiscal del gobierno. La aplicacion de las medidas de austeridad de
gasto, la vigencia del impuesto a las transacciones financieras y otras medidas fiscales,
contribuyeronal logrode estos resultados.

El programa SBA que mantiene Bolivia con el FMI desde el aiio 2003, fue aprobado, el 8 de
abril de 2005, tanto en su quinta revision como en su ampliacion por un lapso de doce meses
(31 de marzo 2006). Con esta extension del Acuerdo, el pais canalizara donaciones por $us
206.5 millones, adicionalmente, considerando 10s recursos que genera el programa de alivio de
deuda (HIPC), el montoalcanzaraa $us 276.9 millones.

El FMI otorgara un financiamiento de aproximadamente $us 64.5 millones, 10s cuales seran
destinados a apoyar las politicas economicas del Gobierno. Finalmente, se iniciara un nuevo
acuerdo Poverty Reduction Growth Facilities (PRGF) por el period0 de tres aAos con el FMI,
cuyo objetivo principal sera el crecimientoeconomicoy la reduccionde la pobreza.

Perspectivas

Para el 2005 se preve un crecimiento proximo al 4.5%, sustentado en mayor volljmenes de
exportacion, tanto al Brasil (25 millones de metros cljbicos dia (MMCD) o mas) como a la
Repljblica Argentina (6.5 MMCD)*. Asimismo, se espera un mayor aprovechamiento del
mercado de Estados Unidos de Norteamerica en el marco del ATPDEA, principalmente en
productos de madera, textiles y joyeria de or0 y una mayor produccion de refinados de
petroleo, como resultado de la mayor extraccion de liquidos, por el aumento en 10s volumenes
de exportacion de gas natural.

Por otra parte, se preve la recuperacion de la produccion minera, principalmente del zinc y
estaho, ante la demanda mundial, principalmente de China. De igual manera, se espera que el
nivel de ejecucion de inversion publicacontribuyay complemente la actividad privada (en 2004
se ejecutaron $us 602 millones).




2Actualmente, se exportan 21 MMCDa Brasil y 4 M M C D a la Repdblica Argentina.

II.EVALUACIONDE LAS POLITICASSOCIALES

Durante 2004, la recuperacion economica no tuvo efectos significativos inmediatos en el
desempeAode 10s sectores sociales. Sin embargo, 10s ministerios del area realizaron esfuerzos
para asegurar la continuidad de las reformas y priorizar las intervenciones orientadas hacia el
logro de las Metas de Desarrollodel Milenio (MDGspor sus siglas en ingles), como instrumento
para ampliar el acceso a servicios sociales basicos y mejorar la calidad de la oferta. Las
politicas y programas se implementaron en un contexto de restricciones fiscales y conflictos
socia~es~.

Desde el aAo 2001, la Estrategia Boliviana de Reduccion de la Pobreza (EBRP) establecio un
marco para la lucha contra la pobreza, creo mecanismos institucionales y de asignacion de
recursos para su implementacion,sin embargo no logro dar prioridada las acciones, lo que ha
ocasionado dispersionde la inversion publicay baja efectividad de las politicas.

Por este motivo, ha sido necesario reforzar 10s objetivos de la EBRP hacia 10s compromisos
asumidos por el pais en la Declaracion de la Cumbre del Milenio, efectuada en el aRo 20004.
Los ODMs se constituyen en lineas de focalizacion para la politica social, considerando su
caracter estrategico para avanzar hacia la consolidacion de avances sectoriales y mejorar la
eficacia en la implementacion de acciones publicas orientadas a la reduccion de la pobreza
extrema, mejoramiento de la salud materno infantil, universalizacion de la educacion primaria,
acceso sosteniblea agua potable y sistemas de saneamiento basico, entre las principales.

A fines de 2004, concluyoel Dialogo Nacional Bolivia Productivay 10s resultadosse encuentran
en proceso de sistematizacion por el Ministerio Sin Cartera Responsable de Participacion
Popular. Los mandatos del Dialogo seran lineamientos de la politica publica de corto y mediano
plazo.

En la gestion 2004, se estima que la incidencia de pobreza habria alcanzado a 63.6% de la
poblacion, mas baja que la estimada para 2003 (64.1%), por otra parte, se estima que la tasa
de desempleoabierto descendio de 9.2% a 8.7% entre 2003 y 2004, situacion que se explicaria
por la generacionde empleos en el sector servicios y construccion.

Los programas enmarcados en proteccidn social se crearon a partir de la promulgacion del
Decreto Supremo 27331 de enero de 2004 con el proposito de beneficiar a la poblacion mas
pobre del pais, en un marco de coordinacion y articulacion. En este contexto se ejecutaron
acciones en el Plan Nacional de Empleo de Emergencia (PLANE) que apoyo mas de 6.000
proyectos y pago salarios a 75.000 obreros entre mayo y diciembre de 2004. Por otra parte, el
Programade Lucha Contra la Pobrezay Apoyo a la InversionSolidaria (PROPAIS) ejecuto 577
proyectoscontribuyendoa la generacion de 8.000 empleos.

Las politicas sectoriales sociales, tuvieron continuidad en la prestacion de servicios. No
obstante la menor disponibilidad de recursos para inversion, en salud mejoro la atencion de la
salud materna,a traves de mayores coberturas de parto institucional y controles prenatalesque
contribuyen al avance en la consolidacion del Seguro Universal Materno lnfantil (SUMI) en el

 La Declaraci6n fue suscrita por 189 paises y plantea 8 objetivos a ser alcanzados hasta el afio 2015, referidos a reducci6n de la
 pobreza, salud, educacibn, equidad de gCnero, medio ambiente y alianzas para el desarrollo.

componente de mujer embarazada5. En salud infantil, se presentaron dificultades en la
implementacion del Programa Ampliado de Inmunizacion (PAI), ya que las coberturas de
vacunacion no fueron las previstas, este problema se soluciono a traves de la realizacion de
campaAas de vacunacion.

En cuanto a enfermedadestransmisibles, la incidencia de malaria fue controlada por lo que la
incidencia parasitaria anual decrecio entre 2003 y 2004. Por su parte, el control de la
tuberculosis avanzo mediante el acortamiento del tratamiento y la utilizacion de nuevos
medicamentos mas efectivos para la curacion de la enfermedad. El Programa de Chagas
enfrento restricciones financieras, sin embargo se realizo el rociado de viviendas y se
identificaron insecticidas mas adecuados para la eliminacion del vector.

En educacion, en la gestion 2004 se realizo una evaluacidn del Programa de Reforma
Educativa y se efectuaron tareas de discusion, debate y preparacion del Segundo Congreso
Educativo, se conform6 el Consejo Nacional de Educacion (CONED) y se implementaron
procesos participativos para la discusion de la politica educativa. En educacion escolarizada se
realizaron acciones orientadas al incremento de coberturas del nivel inicial, formacion docente
para la modalidad bilingue y profesionalizacion de docentes interinos, asimismo, se efectuo la
difusion de informacioneducativa, procesoque contribuiraal analisis y propuestasde ajuste de
las politicasdel sector.

Por otra parte, se financiaron 103 proyectos educativos por un monto de inversion
comprometido de $us 5,O millones para infraestructura y mobiliario. Se implementaron
proyectos educativos indigenas en 10s departamentos de Potosi, La Paz, Santa Cruz,
Chuquisaca, Tarija, Cochabamba y Oruro, con transferencias a 10s gobiernos municipales por
mas de $us 3,O millonesdestinados a infraestructura, mobiliario y procesos pedagogicos.

En el sector saneamiento basico6,la politica sectorial avanzo a traves de la priorizacion de
inversiones en agua y saneamiento en el area rural, inversiones en saneamiento en areas
urbanas e inversiones integrales en areas metropolitanas. En 2004, se ejecutaron 282
proyectos en 299 municipios del pais que beneficiaron a mas de un millon de habitantes en
ocho departamentos del pais (con excepcion de Pando). El 70% de 10s municipios intervenidos
con algun proyecto de agua 6 saneamientocorresponden a las categoriasde mayor pobreza.

Si bien se ha logrado mejorar la cobertura de servicios, a h persisten deficiencias en la calidad
de la provision del servicio relacionadas con una produccion de agua insuficiente, reducidas
horas de disponibilidad del servicio y calidad del agua deficiente (no tratada). Estos problemas,
que se presentan principalmente en las areas peri-urbana y rurales asi como en las ciudades
con menos de 10.000 habitantes, se debieron principalmentea: i) altas perdidas de agua del
sistema (solo se recupera el 45%), ii) baja recoleccidn tarifaria (solo se paga el 60% de 10s
servicios) y; iii) ausenciade mantenimientode 10s servicios.

La instrumentacion de la Fundacion para la Sostenibilidad de 10s Servicios de Agua y
Saneamiento Basico (FUNDASAB) es de vital importancia para el sector, ya que se plantea un


 Sin embargo existe el desafio de promover modalidades m8s adecuadas para acercar la oferta de servicios para mujeres
 embarazadas, particularmente en 8reas rurales y dispersas.

 La solicitud de grupos sociales de El Alto para rescindir contrato con la empresa Aguas del Illimani S.A en diciembre de 2004
 ocasiond incertidumbre en la politica sectorial, sin embargo el Gobiemo continu6 trabajando en el desarrollo de la politica
 financiera y la modemizaci6n del sector.


                                                               52

enfoque integral que, en el cas0 de municipiostendera a mejorar la capacidad tecnica para el
diseAo y ejecucion de proyectos hidricos y sanitarios.

Perspectlvas

La politica social se encuentra condicionada a la restriccion fiscal que enfrenta el pais,
particularmentede inversionpublica, aspect0 que incidira negativamenteen el avance hacia 10s
objetivos y metas sectoriales. Se observa la tendencia a reducir la proporcion de inversion
social respecto a la total hasta niveles similares a 10s reportados a inicio de las reformas
estructurales en estos sectores y el incrementode 10s gastos recurrentes no permitira asegurar
la sostenibilidadde las intervenciones.

En este panorama, se requiere priorizar la asignacion intrasectorial de recursos del area social
en acciones orientadas al logro de las MDGs y proponer mecanismos de proteccion del gasto
que debera ejecutarse de acuerdo a un enfoque de gestion por resultados y de acuerdo a
estrategias viables, efectivasy sostenibles.

Programatico,en su segunda fase, permitira preservar 10s avances de las reformas sociales y
posicionar mejor al pais respecto al cumplimiento de las Metas de Desarrollo del Milenio
(MDGs). La tercera fase (prevista para 2006) se orientara a consolidar 10s resultados de 10s
procesos iniciadosen 10s diferentessectores en la gestion 2004.

Para implementar 10s objetivos estrategicos, se presenta un conjunto de politicas y acciones
especificas relevantes para el fortalecimiento de 10s sectores sociales y el avance en la
consecucion de las MDGs; agrupadas en 5 componentes de intervencion: i) Salud y nutricion,
ii) Educacion, iii) Agua y Saneamiento Basico, iv) Redes de proteccionsocial y v) Seguimiento y
EvaluacionParticipativade las Metas del Milenio.

3.1 Salud y Nutricion

El Ministerio de Salud y Deportes (MSD) acordo con el Banco Mundial orientar 10s
compromisosdel SSPC en cinco areas: i) Fortalecimientode la gestion municipalde salud para
lograr compromiso local en el cumplimiento de las MDGs; ii) Fortalecimiento de la Atencion
Primaria en Salud (APS), incluyendo el desarrollo de un enfoque intercultural; iii)
Establecimiento de una politica de recursos humanos en salud que mejore su distribucion
urbano-rural y su productividad, privilegiandoel primer nivel de atencion; iv) Disminucionde la
desnutricion en menores de 3 aAos y la anemia en mujeres embarazadas y v) Disminucion de
la morbi-mortalidadcausada por enfermedades transmisibles.

Gesti&nmunicipal odentadaalogmr/asMetas de Desarro/odelMilenio

El logro de las MDGs en salud sera posible en la medida que 10s niveles locales asuman un
compromiso en la ejecucion de politicas de salud en el marco de esta iniciativa. Una via para
ligar el compromiso asumido por 10s Directorios Locales de Salud (DILOS) a resultados, es el


                                              53

establecimiento de compromisos de gestion que contemplen indicadores y metas vinculadas a
las MDGs.

La suscripcion de compromisos de gestion sera gradual, de manera que en una primera
instancia, se aplicara el instrumento a un conjunto de municipios priorizados en funcion de
indicadoresde impacto (tasasde mortalidadmaterno-infantily desnutricion), proceso (cobertura
de partos institucionales, cuarto control prenatal, cobertura de vacunacion con pentavalente),
enfermedades transmisibles (chagas, malaria y tuberculosis), oferta (recursos humanos e
infraestructura) y demograficos (densidad poblacional, tasa global de fecundidad y etnia). Se
espera que a mayo de 2005 se hayan suscrito al menos el 20% de municipios de todo el pais,
incluyendo a todos 10s municipios priorizados y abarcando al 20% del total de la poblacion del
pais.

Atencl&npn-marfaensalud conenfoqueintercu/fura/

El pais cuenta con una trayectoria importante en el diseAo y aplicacion de seguros publicos
orientados a proteger al binomio madre-niAo,desde el Seguro Nacional de Maternidad y NiRez
(1996), el Seguro Basico de Salud (1999) hasta el SUMI, implementado a partir de enero de
2003. Sin embargo, 10s dos primeros contaban con un paquete minimo de prestaciones, en
tanto que el SUM1 tiende a ofrecer un mayor numero de prestaciones, con pocas exclusiones.
Este elemento tiende a introducir un desbalanceentre la Atencion Primaria de Salud (APS) y la
atencion de mayor complejidad. Asimismo, dado el caracter multicultural del pais, se pretende
incorporarel enfoque interculturalen el Sistema Nacional de Salud.

Para mayo de 2005, se espera contar con una evaluacion de impacto del SUM1 que permita
identificar las prestaciones de APS que deben ser incluidas en 10s paquetes del Seguro en 10s
municipiospriorizados. Asi tambien se espera haber aprobado una normativa que acredite a 10s
medicos tradicionales y parteras como parte del Sistema Nacional de Salud y al menos 60
establecimientosde salud debierantener adecuacion cultural en la atencion del parto.

Politica derecumos humanos

Uno de 10s factores mas criticos del sistema de salud boliviano es la ausencia de una politica
de recursos humanos que permita mejorar la distribucionde 10s profesionales de la salud entre
el area urbana y rural, incrementar su productividad y establecer incentivos priorizando el
primer nivel de atencion.

El MSD se ha propuesto diseAar una politica de recursos humanos, para lo cual, implementara
un censo de recursos humanos a nivel nacional que alimentara un sistema de informacion a
actualizarse permanentemente, dado el dinamismo del recurso humano en el sistema. El
compromiso para mayo de 2005 es haber aprobado la politica de recursos humanos que
contemple al menos criterios de asignacion de recurso humano; cuantificacion de la brecha de
recurso humano; mecanismo de evaluacion del desempeio y productividaden el primer nivel
de atencion;y una politica de incentivospara el primer nivel de atencion.

Controlde enfennedades transmisibles

Las tres endemias responsables de la mayor carga de enfermedad del pais son Chagas,
malaria y tuberculosis. El MSD ha implementado por varios aAos programas nacionales de
prevenciony control de estas endemias, sin embargo, estos han enfrentado dificultades en su
financiamiento y problemas de gestion, que en algunos casos se han traducido en el retroceso


                                              54

de logros obtenidos en el pasado. Por otra parte, uno de 10s programas nacionales mas costo-
efectivos en la reduccionde la mortalidad infantil, es el Programa Ampliado de lnmunizaciones
(PAI), cuyos logros estan en riesgo por la ausencia de una politica de financiamiento
sostenible.

Para realizar el seguimiento y monitoreo a la evolucion de las acciones de 10s programas
nacionales se identificaron cuatro indicadores: i) la cobertura de vacunacion con 3". Dosis de
DPT3; ii) el IPA de la malaria; iii) la tasa de infestacion de Chagas a nivel municipal y iv) la
curacion de tuberculosis con DOTS. Estos indicadores estan sujetos a la revision del modulo
demografico para el establecimiento de denominadores, sin embargo, se han establecido
algunas metas sobre el numerador y en otros casos se estan revisando las metas establecidas
previamente.

3.2 Educacion

El pais se encuentra implementando la Reforma Educativa desde 1995, con el fin de
transformar el sistema educativo contemplando, en un proceso integral, el area pedagogico-
curricular y la institucional-administrativa,convirtiendo su ejecucion en un proceso complejo y
de impact0 de medianoo largo plazo.

En 10s ultimos aAos, 10s esfuerzos realizados en el sector se orientaron a incrementar las tasas
de cobertura y las tasas de termino, asi como la cantidad y calidad de la infraestructura
educativa. El Ministerio de Educacion ha dado continuidad a la generacion de informacion
sistematizada y analizada, permitiendo replantear 10s lineamientosde politica sectorial.

Hastael 2004 se han realizadoacciones destinadas a fortalecer el funcionamientode lasjuntas
educativas, habiendose revisado y consensuado el nuevo reglamento para la organizacion y
funcionamiento de estas instancias de participacion social, documento concluido para su
aprobacion. Se tienen conformadas 13.858juntas escolares, 1.790juntas de nucleo, 275 juntas
de distrito, y 4 Consejosde PueblosOriginarios.

Se estan desarrollando 1.215 proyectos educativos (PEN, PER y PEI) en 314 municipios (313
programas municipales de educacion) intervenidos, con la participacion activa de docentes,
directores,juntas escolares, padres de familia y actores municipales.

Duranteel 2004 se ha elaborado el reglamentoy convocatoria para optar al cargo de directores
departamentales,habiendoseinstitucionalizado a 10s directoresde La Paz, Oruro, Potosi, Tarija
y Santa Cruz y se encuentra en proceso la seleccion y calificacion para 10s de Chuquisaca y
Beni. Para el 2005 se realizara la convocatoria publica para el Director Departamental de
Cochabamba. Por otro lado, como parte de la estrategia de difusion y socializacion de
informacion estadistica, se publicaron 10s siguientes documentos: "La educacion en Bolivia.
Indicadores, cifras y resultados" y "La educacion en Bolivia. Estadisticas municipales", asi
como el CD "lnformacion estadisticae indicadoresescolares (1996-2002).

Sin embargo, a pesar de 10s avances en la implementacion de la Reforma Educativa, alin
persisten problemas de falta de equidad, retraso en el diseAo e implementacion de la Reforma
en 10s niveles inicial y secundario. El acceso en el nivel secundario sigue siendo bajo, pues solo
la mitad de la poblacion de 14 a 17 aAos asiste a secundaria, situacion que se explica por 10s
problemas relacionados con el nivel primario y la insuficiente oferta escolar en el nivel
secundario. En el nivel inicial, el acceso es bajo puesto que solo un cuarto de 10s niRos de entre
4 y 5 aAos asiste a este nivel, probablemente por la escasa cantidad de escuelas, docentes y


                                                 55

percepcion por parte de la sociedad de la escasa importancia que tiene el nivel inicial en el
desempetio escolar.

Tambien se pueden observar deficiencias en 10s ambitos de la educacion alternativay tecnica,
y la demora en el disetio e implementacion de una estrategia de Reforma en el nivel de
EducacionSuperior.

Para el sector educativo, la gestion 2003 se ha constituido en un aRo de transicion entre la
finalizacion de la primera etapa de la ejecucion de la Reforma Educativa y la definicion de
nuevos lineamientos de politica educativa de la proxima decada. El Ministeriode Educacion ha
trabajado una propuesta de Estrategia de la Educacion Boliviana, la misma que en su version
preliminar ha sido puesta en consideracion a las organizaciones de la sociedad civil a partir de
10s congresos departamentalesy talleres nacionales,realizadosa finales del aAo 2004.

Asimismo, el Ministerio de Educacion se encuentra implementando el Programa Operativo
Multianual (POMA) 2004 - 2008, que plantea la necesidad de desarrollar nuevos procesos de
planificacion, ejecucion, administracion y evaluacion integral, fortaleciendo la capacidad de
gestion del Ministerioy del SEN, incorporando una cultura organizacionalbasada en el enfoque
por resultados, que contribuya efectivamente a la disminucion de las brechas en el acceso,
permanencia y calidad entre distintos sectores de la poblacion; promoviendo el ejercicio pleno
de 10s derechos ciudadanos; asegurando la participaciondemocratica y corresponsabilidadde
la sociedad en el proceso educacional; aumentando la capacidad de gestion institucionalen el
SEN y; mejorando el proceso de aprendizaje - enseRanza,articulando el curriculo en todas las
areas, niveles y modalidades, dotando de infraestructura y equipamiento adecuados y
mejorandola formaciony desempeHode 10s docentes.

Las acciones inscritas en el marco del SSPC responden al enfoque de politica sectorial
planteado por el Ministerio que contribuira al logro de 10s objetivos generales y la
implementacionde 10s lineamientosestrategicos.


Fodalecer /os conse/os educativos

El primer objetivo busca fortalecer el funcionamiento de 10s consejos educativos como modelo
de participacion permanente, contribuyendo a la institucionalizacion de la democracia
participativa en educacion. Las acciones se pueden sintetizar de la siguiente manera: i)
Creacion y organizacion del funcionamiento del Consejo Nacional de Educacion (CONED); ii)
Elaboracion del reglamento de funcionamiento de las juntas educativas; iii) Convocatoria al II
Congreso Nacional de Educacion y; iv) Elaboracion y aprobacion del Programa Operativo
Multianual (POMA) para el period0 2004 - 2008 que incorpora politicas en el marco de las
Metas de Desarrollodel Milenio.


El Consejo Nacional de Educacion (CONED) constituye la maxima instancia de participacion
social en educacion con la atribucion de disetiar y orientar las politicas pliblicas del sector
cuyas actividades se iniciaron en enero de 2004.         Se trata de un consejo ciudadano
conformado por 85 instituciones y organizacionescivicas, sindicales, sociales y educativas del
pais. La directiva del CONED esta conformada por 16 miembros representantesde las distintas
organizacionese instituciones.




                                               56

A traves de un intenso trabajo de concertacionel CONED elaboro 10s lineamientos, el temario,
la metodologia y la convocatoria para el Congreso Nacional de Educacion, que fue concebido
como un procesoparticipativode analisis, reflexiony debate de la educacion boliviana en todos
sus ambitos, areas y niveles,con el proposito de acordar las politicas publicas de la educacion
para 10s proximos quince atios. El desarrollo del proceso comprendio tres fases: i)
reorganizacion de Consejos Departamentales de Educacion (CODED) y realizacion de talleres
en 10s nueve departamentos; ii) realizacion de doce talleres nacionales tematicos y ocho
congresos departamentales de educacion (el Congreso en La Paz no pudo realizarse por
problemas politicosy sindicales); iii) realizacionde la fase plenaria del Congreso y disetio de la
nueva propuestade ley de educacion.


Por otro lado, el POMA es la estrategia para el sector de educacion y responde a la necesidad
de formular politicas, objetivos, estrategias e indicadores de manera integral y articulada de 10s
distintos niveles, areas y modalidades de la educacion y la ciencia y tecnologia, convirtiendose
en un instrumento para avanzar en el cumplimientode las MDGs del sector.


El POMA define acciones en el marco del enfoque sectorial, permitira movilizar financiamiento
bajo la modalidad de SWAP y desarrolla acciones que permiten una mayor articulacion entre
las areas y niveles del SEN, estableciendocomo objetivos generales a la principalesfunciones
del sector y no a las areas y niveles de educacion o a la estructura organizacional del
Ministerio.


Nuevocumkufum de secundada

Se pretende asegurar el desarrollo y la articulacion de un curriculo acreditado que incorpore
interculturalidad, formacion ciudadana, competencias productivas y cultura de investigacion.
Con el proposito de dar continuidad a 10s procesos de cambio y a 10s avances del sector, el
Ministerio ha definido como una prioridad la transformacion de la educacion secundariabajo un
nuevo enfoque educativo que plantea un bachillerato integrado humanistic0 y tecnico que
habilite a 10s jovenes, segun su perfil socioeducativo, para la insercion laboral y/o para la
profesionalizacionsuperior terciaria.


Las bases de esta propuestafueron analizadas y concertadas con actores fundamentales de la
educacion secundaria y de la educacion tecnica en diversos eventos: talleres departamentales
de educacion secundaria, seminarios y talleres de educacion tecnica, asi como en comites
tecnicos con participacionde agentes del sector publicoy privado.


Entre mayo y julio del 2004, el Ministeriode Educacion llevo adelante un proceso para construir
participativamente un plan estrategico de la educacion secundaria. Se desarrollaron nueve
talleres departamentales, tres talleres regionales y un encuentro nacional. En estos eventos se
expusieron 10s documentos marco del proceso de transformacion, elaborados por el Area de
Secundaria desde el aAo 2000, y con diversos actores sociales. Se logro concertar las
estrategias generales asicomo la vision y mision de este nivel.




                                                 57

Se ha conformado un equipo transversal de trabajo, integrado por personal tecnico de
diferentes direcciones del Ministerio, para diseiiar la propuesta con base en las conclusiones,
recomendaciones y sugerencias de 10s eventos antes mencionados.                El proyecto esta
estructurado con base en 10s siguientes componentes: i) acceso y permanencia, que
comprende modalidades de atencion diversificadas y mecanismos especificos de prevencion
del abandon0 escolar; ii) servicios educativos, que comprende el diseiio curricular, la formacion
y capacitacion docente, la dotacion;y iii) gestion institucional. El documento de proyecto estara
concluido a fines de abril y sera puesto a consideracion del Banco Mundial para su
financiamiento.


Merta educativadivema

Se propone desarrollar una oferta educativa diversa para responder a las necesidades
diferenciadas de la poblacion, logrando que la educacion se convierta en uno de 10s
mecanismos principales de inclusion social. Para el logro de este proposito se ha previsto la
definicion de intervenciones para incrementar la permanencia de niiios y niiias en el sistema
educativo nacional.


El objetivo a largo plazo es impulsar el acceso y permanencia de las niiias en las escuelas del
area rural a traves de la generalizacion de estrategias de intervencion exitosas, sostenibles y
promover un cambio de actitud en la comunidad educativa respecto a la participacion de las
niiias del nivel primario. El proyecto contempla la ejecucion de tres fases: i) investigacion
diagnostica cuantitativa y cualitativa, que consistia en identificar 10s municipios con
marginalidad femenina y 10s factores concomitantes; ii) Sensibilizacion a la comunidad y
capacitacion a maestros; y iii) implementacion de intervenciones focalizadas en municipios,
segljn las necesidadesidentificadas.


Teniendo en cuenta la reducciondel presupuesto del componente, acordada entre el Ministerio
de Educacion y el Banco Mundial, se establecio que se realizarian dos experiencias piloto de
intervencion focalizada, una en el municipio de Poroma con la Fundacion Treveris y la otra en
el municipio de Tiraque con la institucion Fe y Alegria. Si embargo, el Ministeriode Educacion
ha asegurado intervencionesen un grupo de municipios donde existen brechas en el acceso y
permanenciade niHos y niiias en la educacion primaria.


3.3 Agua y saneamiento

La politica de agua y saneamiento basico tiene el objetivo de contribuir, en una perspectiva de
largo plazo, al mejoramiento de las condiciones de higiene y salud de la poblacion que se
encuentra en las areas rurales y periurbanasdel pais.

Para alcanzar este objetivo, el Gobierno se propone incrementar la cobertura de 10s servicios
de agua y saneamiento mediante la aplicacion de politicas y estrategias sectoriales que
promuevan una transformacion institucional hacia la equidad, la eficiencia economica, la
eficiencia en la gestion de empresas y el cuidado del medio ambiente. Se cuenta con el Plan
Nacional de Agua y Saneamiento (PNAS), cuyos componentes principales son la Reforma
lnstitucional (Nueva Politica Financiera - NPF), el Programa de Modernizacion lnstitucional
(PMI) y el Mecanismo lnstitucionalpara la Asistencia Tecnica (FUNDASAB).


                                                58

La Reforma lnstitucionaltiene como fin garantizar la sostenibilidad de 10s proyectos de agua y
saneamiento y la canalizacion de fondos para la inversion a traves de la implementacionde la
Nueva Politica Financiera (NPF). En este contexto, la NPF permitira aplicar mecanismos
transparentes de financiamiento adecuados a las condiciones de capacidad de pago de la
poblacion,bajo premisas de eficiencia economicay de gestion de las Empresas Prestadorasde
Serviciosde Agua y Saneamiento(EPSAs)

Por otra parte, se pretendeelevar la eficienciay calidad de 10s servicios de agua y saneamiento
a traves de la implementacion del Programa de Modernizacionlnstitucional (PMI) que permitira
mejoras en 10s modelos de gestion de 10s servicios (administracion/operacion)de las empresas
de ambito municipal. Bajo un enfoque de oferta para cada EPSA, se otorgara un financiamiento
concesional y condicional para la ejecucion de Planes lntegrales de Desarrollo (PID) de 10s
servicios de las empresas que cumplan condiciones minimas de elegibilidad y se sometan al
PMI.

La ejecucion de la NPFy del PMI requiere promulgar un marco legal e institucionalpromotorde
eficiencia y sostenibilidad en la prestacion de 10s servicios y que principalmente aumente la
fluidez de la inversion y la transferenciatecnologicaal interior del sector.

A traves del componente de Asistencia Tecnica se pretende promover la participacion efectiva
de la comunidad en el proceso de desarrollo para la viabilidad y sostenibilidad social del plan.
Para tal efecto se ha previsto la creacion de la FUNDASAB que apoye la transformacion y el
mejoramiento institucional integral de 10s prestadores de 10s servicios de agua y saneamiento
(EPSAs) y de 10s Gobiernos Municipales. En este contexto, 10s roles de la FUNDASABseran: i)
apoyar a las EPSAs en el cumplimiento de 10s requisitos de las diferentes etapas establecidas
en el PMI, ii) apoyar al fortalecimiento institucional de 10s operadores y; iii) promover la
participacionsocial efectiva.

La FUNDASAB,ademas de permitir el desarrollo de capacidades localespara la identificaciony
gestion del ciclo de proyectos, apoyara el fortalecimiento institucional de las EPSAs, la
capacitacionde recursos humanosy el us0 de tecnologiasapropiadas.

La Politica Financiera Sectorial y la FUNDASAB son reformas apoyadas por el Credit0
Programatico- SSPC del BM y KfW. El cumplimiento del objetivo sera verificado mediante el
Sistema de Informacion Sectorial (SIAS) que se constituye en un instrumento de planificacion
sectorial, para la difusion de las politicas y normas nacionales de manera oportuna y
transparente.

3.4 Red de Protecci6nSocial

El Gobierno de Bolivia considera prioridad la creacion de condiciones para reducir la tension
social, a fin de fortalecer la gobernabilidad e impulsar la recuperacion economica, para ello ha
decidido establecer la Red de Proteccion Social como un instrumento de coordinacion y
focalizacionde las intervenciones del sector publico en beneficiode la poblacion mas pobre.

La Red de Proteccion Social se orienta a integrar la informacion sobre beneficiarios y
programas dirigidos a la poblacion mas vulnerable, como son el Plan Nacional de Empleo de
Emergencia (PLANE) y el Programa de Atencion Integral a NiAos y NiAas Menores de 6 aAos
(PAN), asimismo, administra el Programa de Lucha contra la Pobreza y Apoyo a la Inversion
Social (PROPAIS). La Red de Proteccion Social se encuentra bajo la tuicion del Directorio


                                                 59

Unico de Fondos (DUF), dependiente del Ministerio de Participacion Popular. Tomando en
cuenta 10s conceptos de Proteccion Social existentes actualmente, se pretende cambiar el
sentido de condicionalidadde la Red de Proteccion Social, de manera tal que se asegure la
focalizacion de 10s recursosescasos asi como su efectividad.

Para el mejoramiento de las condiciones de vida de las personas pobres hasta el aAo 2015,
todas las politicas que esten dirigidas a este grupo poblacional deberan enmarcarse en el
cumplimiento de las Metas de Desarrollodel Milenio. Un instrumento para este proposito es la
Politica Nacional de Compensacion (PNC) que fue establecida en la Ley del Dialogo como una
politica de Estado que apoya la EBRP y la descentralizacion, a traves del ordenamiento de las
transferencias a municipios. Se identificaron tres aspectos dentro del componente Proteccion
Social:


Odentarlapoliticade transferenelaslntetyubetnamentaleshacia el
cumplimiento de/asMDGs

Existe una propuesta que modifica la PNC y se denomina Politica de Transferencias
Condicionadas (PTC), que pretende simplificar y armonizar las condiciones impuestas por 10s
distintos donantes y fuentes de financiamiento para brindar un servicio transparente a 10s
municipios, agilizar 10stramites y contar con un sistema Ljnico para la tramitacion de proyectos.

En sintesis, la PTC introduce una Iogica distinta de asignacion de recursos, modificando la
nocion de derechos adquiridos, sobre montos indicativos, para 10s gobiernos municipales, a
una nueva Iogica de preferencia de acceso a recursos, segljn 10s indicadores sectoriales de
desarrollo de cada municipio.

Para una adecuada implementacion de la PTC, se ha previsto realizar una prueba piloto en la
gestion, para tal efecto se selecciono al sector salud y se identificaron dos metas: mortalidad
infantil y mortalidad materna. Se requiere la asignacion de recursos del Ministerio de Salud-
Banco Mundialal FPS para implementaresta accion.


Creare implementar unaRed deProteccionSocial

El Gobierno ha iniciado la formulacion de una Estrategia Integral de Proteccion Social (RIPS)
que aglutina una serie de iniciativas existentes de manera tal que 10s beneficiarios gocen de
intervencionesque les afecten en varios aspectos. Los grupos identificados para la RIPS son: i)
NiRos menores a 5 aAos; ii) NiAos entre 6 y 18 aAos de edad; iii) Desempleados y
subempleados; iv) Adultos mayores de 65 aAos; y v) Discapacitados. Para atender a 10s mas
vulnerables, se decidio por cubrir tan solo a las personas identificadasen 10s anteriores grupos
que se encuentrenen situacion de pobreza extrema.

Para la aprobacion de la RIPS, se precisa la aceptacion de esta Estrategia por parte de varios
sectores y se requiere una instancia politica que se encargue de coordinar esta labor. AI
respecto, en la Resolucion CONAPE No02/2005 de 19 de abril de 2005, se define al Consejo
Nacional de Politica Economica (CONAPE) como la instancia rectora de la politica de
Proteccion Social en Bolivia. Por otro lado, de acuerdo a Decreto Supremo No27331 de enero
de 2004, se establece que el Ministerio de Participacion Popular ejerce tuicion del Directorio
Unico de Fondos (DUF) que es responsable de la formulacion de la Red Integral de Proteccion
Social.


                                                60

Por otra parte, se acordo incorporar las intervencionesdel area de nutricion como parte de las
intervenciones de proteccion social. A pesar que la evidencia empirica muestra la importancia
de la nutricion adecuada en el quiebre del circulo vicioso de pobreza, sobre todo en menores
de 3 ahos y mujeres embarazadas, las politicas nutricionalesno han sido priorizadasdentro de
la agenda publica, debido a la ausencia de liderazgoen el tema. Para superar este problema se
creo el Consejo Nacional de Alimentacion y Nutricion (CONAN), con el objeto de asumir el rol
de lider en el diseAo e implementacionde las politicasde nutriciony seguridadalimentaria.

El Ministerio de Salud y Deportes forma parte del CONAN y tiene como tarea, hasta mayo de
2005, la elaboracion e implementacion de un plan integral de intervenciones nutricionales en
10s25 municipiosen riesgo nutricionalen menoresde 3 aAos y mujeresembarazadas.

Las actividades establecidas en el "Plan de mejoramiento nutricional en 26 municipios
priorizados de Bolivia", seran ejecutadas por el Ministerio de Salud y Deportes a traves de la
Direccion de Servicios de Salud/Programa Nacional de Alimentacion y Nutricion y el Proyecto
de la Reformade Salud/ProgramaNacional EXTENSA. La operativizacion se efectuaraa traves
de 10s Servicios Departamentalesde Saludy 10s municipiosparticipantesen esta iniciativa:

    1. Brindar conocimientossobre alimentaciony nutricion,
    2. lncrementar la lactanciamaternay la alimentacioncomplementaria,
    3. Desarrollode accionesmultisectoriales para mejorar la seguridadalimentaria,
    4. Suministrode micronutrientes,
    5. Desarrollodel sistema de vigilancia epidemiologica nutricional,
    6. Desarrollode la redde referenciay contrarrefenciade desnutridograve y moderado.



Mejorarla eficaciadelPLANE

En vista de la mejora de 10s indicadores macroeconomicos en el aRo 2004, el Gobierno ha
decidido reducir la importancia del PLANE, considerando que era un programa de emergencia
y que se ha extendido por casi 4 aAos. Es asi, que para el PLANE-Ill que abarca el period0
junio 2004 a diciembre 2005, la meta es pagar alrededor de 200.000 salarios en total.

3.5 Monitoreo y evaluacih participativos de las Metas de Desarrollo
del Milenio

La agenda social pretende reforzar 10s objetivos y acciones de la politica social hacia el logro
de las Metas de Desarrollodel Milenio, en tres sectores sociales priorizados: salud, educacion y
agua y saneamiento basico. Por este motivo, las actividades de monitoreo y evaluacion de 10s
avances de las Metas constituyen un instrumento fundamental para la implementacion de
acciones sectoriales.

En el marco del SSPC, este componente define 10s siguientes objetivos a: i) Lograr que la
informacion presupuestaria de 10s 3 sectores sociales priorizados sea accesible en forma
oportuna; ii) Asegurar la provision de informacionpara el monitoreode las MDGs, consolidando
un sistema integrado de informacion estadistica; iii) lncluir en la evaluacion de 10s programas
de 10s 3 sectores priorizados, la opinion de 10s usuarios; iv) Desarrollar la capacidad



                                               61

institucional para la evaluacion del progreso en el logro de 10s principales indicadores
relacionadoscon las MDGs.

lnfonnacionpresupuestaria de10ssectoressociales

1. MACROECONOMIC EVALUATION

Preliminary data indicate that during 2004 the Bolivian economy experienced a 3.6% growth
rate, the highest since the beginning of the declining pace of economic activity in 1999. The
1.3% per capita GDP growth (deducting population increase) reverts the trend of the past 5
years, which registerednegativeand near zero growth rates.

According to the information available for the third quarter of 2004, GDP growth continued
beingexplained by the dynamism of external demand, however,a recovery of domestic demand
was observed. Within a context of fiscal austerity, the growth of domestic demand is explained
in terms of the growth of private consumptionand the recovery of public investment.

The most dynamic sectors up to September 2004 were: crude oil and natural gas (32.3%),
transportation and storage (4.0%) and manufacturing industry (4.1Yo). On the other hand, the
sectors that experienced a low growth rate were: agriculture and livestock breeding (0.6%) and
construction (1.I %). The sectors that experienced important negative variations were: metallic
and non metallic minerals (-9.1Yo)and financial services (-7.5%).

Accumulated inflation as of December 2004 inflation reached 4.62%, higher than that
registered during 2003 (3.94%). The increased inflationary pace is attributed both to internal as
well as external factors. Among the internal factors the following stand out: i) scarcity of diesel
supplies that introduced distortions in the determination of interdepartmental transportation
tariffs and; ii) weather-related factors (droughts in the country's eastern region during the last
months of 2004) which caused supply problems in urban markets provoking increases in the
price of beef and similar products, which resulted in a higher accumulated inflation between
September and October, exceeding 2.60% and 3.43% during both months.

Among the external factors that had an incidence on inflation, the accumulated depreciation of
the nominal exchange rate as of December2004 stands out, which reached 2.81%, lower than
the rate registered during a similar period in 2003 (4.53%). The depreciation pace was caused
in part by the evolution of international inflation, consequently, general inflation was affected
partially by the increasingtrend of international prices.

In the external sector, exports of non factorial goods and services increased by 35.3% and
9.6%, respectively; and imports of goods increased by 15.7%. This behavior allowed for a
commercial surplus that in turn made it possible to attain a Current Account surplus. The
favorable evolution of foreign trade is explained by the current international situation, which
allowed exporting increased volumes of domestic production at better prices; in turn, the
reactivation of internal activity and final demand promoted increased imports of capital goods
and inputs as well as final goods. On the other hand, an important expansion of natural gas
sales to Brazil was observed as well as the reestablishment of natural gas exports to the
Republicof Argentina.

The good resultsof foreign trade were also boosted by the actual depreciationof the multilateral
exchange rate by almost 6%, as a result of the stabilization of the foreign exchange situation at



                                                 66

the regional level, after the problems experienced by domestic currencies in Argentina and
BraziI.

The Balance of Payments registered a surplus of $US 166 million following the deficits
observed mainly during the 2001-2002 crisis period. This surplus is explained by the positive
balance in the Current Account, due to the relative improvement of the surplus in the Capital
and Financial Account that grew 8.6% between 2004 and 2003, and the reduction of
disbursements for public indebtedness The result in the Balance of Payments generated an
increasedflow of Net InternationalReservestotaling $US 77.4 million in 2003 to $US123 million
in 2004.

In the financial sector, a recovery of deposit and portfolio levels was observed as of the
second semester of 2004. What is worth underscoring is the decrease of deposits in United
States dollars by five percentage points. Financial brokerage entities experienced lower
delinquency levels and have continued enforcing their provision policies in order to maintain
their financial soundness and sustainability. The relative share of non banking entities in the
financial system, especially microfinanceentities continued increasing.

The monetary policy has been aimed mostly at controlling inflation and providing adequate
liquidity to the economy, through the `reporto'* windows and the liquidity credits of RALfund.

Fiscal sector=Revenues,public expenditureand ddclt

During 2004 the fiscal policy was aimed at curbing deficit growth and bridging the fiscal gap
required to attain the budgeted fiscal deficit of 6.8% of the GDP. In this manner, a program of
fiscal austerity was executed, the Law that established the Tax on Financial Transactions (ITF)
was enacted and the Exceptional Voluntary and Transitory Program (PTVE) continued. These
measures allowed reprogrammingfiscal deficit, establishing as a goal 6.0% of the GDP; having
closed the fiscal year at 5.7% of the GDP, which represented a fiscal adjustment of 2.4
percentagepoints of the GDP with respect to the 2003 deficit.

Excludingexpendituresstemmingfrom the pensions reform, the global deficit in 2004 is 0.9% of
the GDP. On the other hand, if we take the primary balance as an indicator, which does not
include interests on the debt, a 2.9% GDP deficit would be registered decreasing the primary
deficit by 2.5 percentagepoints of the GDP with respectto 2003.

Within the austerity framework, maximum remuneration levels were established, current
expenditures were reduced by 5%, reserved expenditures by 58% and expenditures on study
and research activities by 10%. Additionally, vacant directive positions were suppressed within
the Institutional Reform Program (PRI), the use of cellular phones, motor vehicles and fuel was
restrictedand limitswere establishedfor "personalservices" and "study and research activities".

Concerning the Tax Regularization Program, the term for natural and/or legal persons to benefit
from the program was extended. The extension of the term for the nationalization of motor
vehicles was also approved,and as of July 1`` 2004 payment of the tax on financial transactions
(ITFfor its Spanish acronym) became effective.

Flscal DeficitofNon FlnancialPublic Sector{SPNF forits Spanishacronym)

In 2004, the operations of the SPNF registereda 5.7% GDP deficit, lower by 2.4 percentage points
than the GDP deficit registered in 2003, due to the generation of increased tax revenues. 74% of
the fiscal deficit was financed with external resources from multilateralorganizations such as the
Andean Development Corporation (CAF), the World Bank (WB) and the Inter American
Development Bank (IDB); the remaining 26% was financed with internal resources, particularly,
through the issuance of bonds to Pensions Funds Administrators (AFPs), Treasury Letters and
Bondsand the issuanceof fiscal certificates.

Total revenues for fiscal year 2004 exceeded 2.7 percentage points of the GDP with respect to
fiscal year 2003, as a result of higher tax revenues generated mainly by the following factors: i)
the regularization of tax debts at the internal revenue service, customs and municipal level,
which exceeded the initial expectations, ii) the higher profits generated by the oil sector in 2003,
coupled to the imposition of the Transactions Tax (IT for its Spanish acronym) on domestic

sales of oil, natural gas and their by-products'; iii) the implementation of the Tax on Financial
transactions (ITF) as of July 2004; and iv) increasednaturalgas exports to Brazil and additional
gas exports to the Argentine Republic.

SPNF's Total expenditures, without taking pensions into consideration, similar levels were
maintainedas in fiscal year 2003. Currentexpenditureswere below0.7 percentagepointsof the
GDP as a consequence of the application of the Fiscal Austerity Decrees; while public
investment was higher by approximately one percentage point of the GDP, attributable to the
increased execution of investment programs and projects in the infrastructure sector, mainly
highway construction.

Expenditures in pensions is one of the highest items of Government expenditures, representing
4.8% of the GDP, a percentage that is slightly lower than that registered during fiscal year 2003.
The cost of pensions is the result of the policies applied in previous years such as the: reduction
of the retirementage, minimumpensionof Bs 850, indexationof pensions to the UFV, among the
most importantones.

Public investment executed in 2004 totaled $US 601.6 million, which is 20.4% higher with
respect to the amount reported during fiscal year 2003 ($US 499.8 million), going from 6.4% of
the GDP to 7.2% during both fiscal years. It should be mentioned that during fiscal year 2004,
public investment registered the highest execution percentage of the 2000 - 2004 period,
attaining a 120.2%proportion in comparisonto 78.0%for fiscal year 2003.

Public investment in 2004 was concentrated mainly in infrastructure programs and projects,
whose relative share increased by 4.2 percentage points with respect to 2003. It is foreseen that
the dynamism of this sector will allow creating an adequate environmentfor private investment.

Agreement wfth theIntemat/ona/ Monetary Fund (IMF)

The Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with IMF was approved on April 2, 2003. In 2004 two
Economic and Financial Policy Memoranda were subscribed, corresponding to the third and
fourth modification to the original SBA. In the third revision to the SBA, the budgeted fiscal
deficit was reduced to 6.1% of the GDP after donations and the level of pro-poor expenditures
increasedby 0.6% of the GDP. In the fourth revisionto the SBA, it was verified that the goals of
the first semester were attained, except for the Central Bank's (BCB) net international reserves
and net assets.

By late 2004, the economy showed signs of recovery with a 3.6% GDP growth, increased public
revenues and the reductionof expenditures. These results enabled it to comply with the agreed
upon goals for the year that was analyzed. Fiscal deficit was reduced, given that 5.7% of the
GDP was attained, 0.4% lower than the provision established in the Government's fiscal
program. The application of austerity measures to expenditures, the implementation of the tax
on financial transactions and other fiscal measures, contributed to the attainment of these
results.

The SBA program that Bolivia maintains with IMF since 2003, was approved on April 8, 2005,
both in its fifth revision as well as the extension for a period of twelve months (March 3Is`,
2006). With the Agreement's extension, the country channels donations totaling $US2065
million, additionallytaking into considerationthe resourcesgenerated by the debt relief program
for highly indebted poor countries (HIPC), this amount totals $US276.9 million.

IMF shall grant funding totaling approximately $US 64.5 million, which will be destined to
support the Government'seconomic policies. Finally, a new agreement with IMF will be initiated
(PRGF) for the three-year period, whose main objective shall include economic growth and
poverty reduction.

Prospects

During 2005 a growth rate of approximately 4.5% was foreseen, supported by higher export
volumes to Brazil (25 million cubic meters per day (MCMD) or more) as well as to the Republic
of Argentina (6.5 MCMD)*. Likewise, an increased share in the United States market within the
framework of ATPDEA, mainly in the area of wood products,textiles and gold jewelry, as well as
increasedproductionof refined oil products, as a result of the higher extraction of liquids due to
the increasedvolumes of natural gas exports.

On the other hand, the recovery of mining productionwas foreseen, mainly zinc and tin, given
increased worldwide demand, mainly from China. Likewise, it is expected that the public
investment execution level shall contribute to and complement the private activity ($US 602
millionwere executed during 2004).




 21 MCMD are currently exportedto Brazil and4 MCMDto the Republic of Argentina.

II. EVALUATION OF SOCIAL POLICIES

During 2004, the economic recovery did not have immediate significant effects on the
performance of social sectors. However, the Ministries of the area made efforts to ensure the
continuity of the reforms and prioritize interventions aimed at attaining the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs), as an instrument to expand access to basic social services and
improve the quality of the offer. The policiesand programs were implementedwithin a context of
fiscal restrictionsand social conflicts3.

As of 2001, the Bolivian Poverty Reduction Strategy (BPRS) established a framework for the
fight against poverty and created institutional and resource allocation mechanisms for the
implementationthereof, however, it failed to prioritize the actions, which caused the dispersion
of public investmentand a reducedeffectivenessof the policies.

Due to this, it was necessary to reinforce BPRS objectives in line with the commitments
assumed by the country in the Declarationof the Millennium Summit held in 20004.The ODMs
constitute focalization lines for social policy,considering their strategic natureto advance toward
the consolidation of sectoral advances and improve effectiveness in the implementation of
public actions aimed at reducing extreme poverty, improving child and maternal health,
universalizing elementary education, enabling sustainable access to running water and basic
sanitation systems, among the most importantones.

At the end of 2004, the National Dialogue on Productive Bolivia concluded and the results are
currently being systematized by the Ministry without Portfolio Responsible for Popular
Participation.The mandates of the Dialogueshall constitutethe guidelines of the short-term and
medium-termpublic policy.

During 2004, it was estimated that the incidence of poverty had reached 63.6% of the
population, lower than the figure estimated for 2003 (64.1%), on the other hand, it is estimated
that open unemploymentdecreasedfrom 9.2% to 8.7% between 2003 and 2004, a situationthat
would be explained by the generationof employment in the service and constructionsectors.

The programs comprised within the framework of social protection were created as of the
promulgation of Supreme Decree 27331 dated January 2004 with the purpose of benefiting the
country's most impoverished population sectors, within a framework of coordination and
articulation. In this context a number of actions were executed within the National Emergency
Employment Plan (PLANE for its Spanish acronym) which supported more than 6.000 projects
and paid salaries to 75.000 workers between May and December 2004. On the other hand, the
Programto Fight Poverty and Support Solidarity Investment(PROPAISfor its Spanish acronym)
executed 577 projectscontributing to generate8.000 jobs.

The continuity of sectoral social policies was evidenced by the provision of services.
Notwithstandingthis, the reduced availability of investment resources, health care improved in
the area of maternal health, through the increased coverage of institutional deliveries and
prenatal controls that contribute to advance the consolidation of the Universal Mother-Child

  reduction, health,education, gender equity, environment and alliances for development.


                                                              71

Insurance (SUM1for its Spanish acronym) in the pregnant woman component5.In the area of
child health, some difficulties were experienced during the implementation of the Extended
Immunization Program (PA1for its Spanish acronym), given that vaccination coverage was not
foreseen, this problem was addressedthrough the implementationof vaccination campaigns.

With respect to transmissible diseases, the incidence of malaria was controlled, therefore the
annual incidence of parasitic ailments decreased between 2003 and 2004. On the other hand,
tuberculosis control made progress through the implementation of shorter treatment protocols
and the use of new and more effective drugs to cure the disease. The Chagas Program faced
financial restrictions, however homes were sprayed and more adequate insecticides were
identifiedto eliminatethe vector.

In the area of education, during 2004 an evaluation of the Educational Reform Program was
conducted and various discussions and debates were held, and the Second Educational
Congresswas prepared,the National EducationCouncil (CONED)was formed and participatory
processes were implementedto discuss the educational policy. Inthe area of school education,
actions aimed at increasing the coverage of the initial or elementary level were implemented,
the preparationof faculty for the bilingual modalityand professionaleducationfor interim faculty,
likewise, educational information was disseminated, a process that shall contribute to the
analysis and adjustmentof proposed policiesfor this sector.

On the other hand, 103 educational projects were financed with a total pledged investment of
$US 5.0 million for infrastructure and furniture. Indigenous educational projects were
implemented in the Departments of Potosi, La Paz, Santa Cruz, Chuquisaca, Tarija,
Cochabamba and Oruro, with transfers to municipal governments in excess of $US 3.0 million
destined to infrastructure,furniture and pedagogicalprocesses.

In the basic sanitation6,sector the sectoral policy was advanced though the prioritization of
investments in water and sanitation projects in the rural area, investments in sanitation in urban
areas and integral investments in metropolitan areas. In 2004, 282 projects were executed in
299 municipalities throughout the country that benefited more than one million inhabitants in
eight Departments (except Pando). 70% of the municipalities intervened with a water or
sanitation project correspond to the most poverty stricken categories.

Even though improvements were made in terms of service coverage, there are still some
deficiencies in the quality of service delivery which are translated into insufficient water
production, reducedservice availabilityand deficient water quality (untreated).These problems,
which are evident mainly in peri-urbanand rural areas as well as in cities with fewer than 10,000
inhabitants, were mostly due to: i) the system's high water loses (only 45% is recovered), ii) low
tariff collection (only 60% of this service is actually paid) and; iii) absence of maintenance
services.

The instrumentation of the Foundation for the Sustainability of Water and Basic Sanitation
Services (FUNDASAB for its Spanish acronym) is of vital importance for the sector, because it



 However there i s a challenge that consists on promoting more adequate modalities to expand the service offer for pregnant
  women, particularly in rural and disperse areas.

 The contract with Aguas del Illimani S.A. was terminated in December, 2004. This situation caused uncertainty at the sectoral
  policy level, however, the Govemment expressed the importance o f continuing the financial policy and modemization o f this
  sector.


                                                              72

sets forth an integral approach, which in the case of the municipalities will tend to improve the
technical capacity for the design and executionof water and basic sanitation projects.

Prospects

The social policy is conditioned to the fiscal restriction that the country is currently addressing,
particularly in terms of public investment, an aspect that will have a negative incidence on the
advancement of sectoral objectives and goals. A tendency to reduce the proportion of social
investment with respect to the total is observed up to levels similar to those reported at the
beginning of the structural reforms in these sectors and the increased recurrent expenditures
will not allow ensuring the sustainabilityof these interventions.

In this scenario, it is necessaryto prioritizethe intrasectoralallocationof resourcesfor the social
area in actions aimed at attaining the MDGs and proposing protection mechanisms for
expenditures to be executed in adherence to a result-orientedapproach and in compliance with
viable, effective and sustainablestrategies.

111. SOCIAL SECTORS PROGRAMMATIC CREDIT
(SSPC)

The general objective of SSPC is to support the country during a period of severe fiscal
adjustment and social tension enhanced by the worsening economic crisis. The Programmatic
Credit, in its second phase, will allow preservingthe advances of social reforms and improving
the country's position with respect to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs). The third phase (foreseen for 2006) is aimed at consolidating the results of the
processesinitiated in the different sectors during2004.

To implement the strategic objectives, there is a set of policies and relevant specific actions to
strengthen the social sectors and advance the attainment of the MDGs; grouped in 5
interventioncomponents: i) Healthand nutrition, ii) Education, iii) Water and Basic Sanitation,iv)
Social protection networks and v) Follow-up and Participatory Evaluation of the Millennium
DevelopmentGoals.

3.1 Healthand Nutrition

The Ministryof Healthand Sports (MOH) agreed with the World Bank to guide the commitments
of the SSPC in five areas: i) Strengthen municipal health management in order to secure local
commitment to attain the MDGs; ii) Strengthen Primary Health Care (APS for its Spanish
acronym), includingthe development of an intercultural approach; iii) Establishment of a human
resource policy for the health sector aimed at improving the urban-rural distribution thereof as
well as their productivity, privilegingthe first level of health care; iv) Decrease malnutritionlevels
in children under the age of 3 and anemia in pregnant women and v) Decrease morbility-
mortalitycaused by transmissible diseases.

Municipalmanagement aimedat attaining theMillenniumDevelopmentGoals

The attainment of MDGs in the health area will be possible to the extent local levels assume a
commitment in terms of the execution of health policies within the framework of this initiative.
One way to link the commitment assumed by the Local Health Boards (DILOS for its Spanish


                                                   73

acronym) has resulted in the establishment of management commitments that foresee
indicatorsand goals linked to the MDGs.

The subscription of management commitments will be gradual, so that in a first instance, the
instrument will be applied to a set of prioritized municipalities based on impact indicators
(mother-child mortality rates and malnutrition), process (coverage of institutional deliveries,
fourth prenatal control, vaccination coverage with pentavalent),transmissiblediseases (chagas,
malaria and tuberculosis), offer (human resources and infrastructure) and demographic
(population density, global fertility rate and ethnic origin). It is expected that by May 2005 at
least 20% of the country's municipalities will be subscribed, including all the prioritized
municipalitiesand encompassing20% of the country'stotal population.

Pdmaw health care withanInterculturalapproach

The country has significant experience in the design and application of public insurance aimed
at protecting the mother-child, binomial, including the National Maternal and Child Insurance
(1996), the Basic Health Insurance (1999) and the SUMI, implemented as of January 2003.
However, the first two had a minimum package of benefits, while SUM1 tends to offer a larger
number of benefits,with few exclusions. This element tends to introducean unbalance between
Primary Health Care (APS) and more complex health care. Likewise, given the country's
multicultural nature, it intends to incorporate the intercultural approach to the National Health
System.

By May 2005, an impact evaluation of SUM1 will have been conducted, which will allow
identifying the benefits of Primary Health Care (APS) that must be included in the Insurance
packages of prioritized municipalities. We also expect to have approved a set of norms to
accredit traditional doctors and midwives as part of the National Health System and at least 60
healthfacilities must have cultural adjustment policies in placeto performdeliveries.

Humanresourcespolfcy

One of the most critical factors of the Bolivian health system is the absence of a human
resource policy that allows improvingthe distribution of health professionalsbetween the urban
and rural area, increasingtheir productivityand establishing incentives prioritizing the first level
of health care.

The MOH intends to design a human resource policy, and to that effect, it shall conduct
a census of human resources at the national level to feed a database that will be
updated on a permanent basis, given the dynamism of human resources within the
system. The commitment for May 2005 is to have approved the human resource policy
that comprises at least the criteria for the allocation of human resources; the
quantification of the human resource gap; a performance and productivity evaluation
mechanism at the first level of healthcare; and an incentive policy for first level health care.

Transmissiblediseasecontrol

The three endemic diseases that account for the largest disease burden in the country are
chagas, malaria and tuberculosis. The MOH has implemented for several years national
preventionand control programsfor these endemic diseases, however, there have been funding
difficulties and management problems, which in some cases negatively affected past


                                                 74

achievements. On the other hand, one of the most cost-effective national programs to reduce
infant mortality, is the Extended Immunizations Program (PAI), whose achievements are at risk
due to the absenceof a sustainablefunding policy.

To follow up and monitor the evolution of actions in national programs four indicators were
identified: i) vaccination coverage with the 3rddose of DPT3; ii) Malaria's IPA; iii) Chagas
infestation rate at the municipal level and iv) cure of tuberculosis with DOTS. These indicators
are subject to the review of the demographic module in order to establish denominators;
however, some goals with respect to the numerator were also established and in other cases
the previouslyestablishedgoals are being revised.

3.2 Education

The country has been implementing the Educational Reform since 1995, with the purpose of
transforming the educational system encompassing, in an integral process, the pedagogical-
curricular area and the institutional-administrativearea, turning the execution thereof into a
complex process with a medium and long-termimpact.

During the past years, the efforts made in this sector were aimed at increasing coverage rates
and term rates, as well as the quantity and quality of educational infrastructure. The Ministry of
Education lent continuity to the generation of systematized and analyzed information, allowing
for the reformulationof sectoral policy guidelines.

Up to 2004 actions were carried out with the aim of strengthening the operation of educational
boards, having revised and agreed on the new regulationsfor the organization and operation of
these social participation instances. The document was duly finished for approval. 13,858
school boards, 1,790 nucleus boards, 275 district boards, and 4 Native Population Councils
were established.

1,215 educational projects are being developed (PEN, PER and PEI) in 314 intervened
municipalities (313 municipal education programs), with the active participation of the faculty,
principals,school boards, parentsand municipalactors.

During 2004 regulations were developed and a call was issued to fill the positions of
departmentaldirectors, having institutionalizedthe directors of La Paz, Oruro, Potosi,Tarija and
Santa Cruz, and the directors for Chuquisaca and Beni are still in the selection and qualification
process. In 2005 a public invitation to fill the position of the Cochabamba Departmental Director
will be issued. On the other hand, as part of the statistical information dissemination and
socialization strategy the following documents were published: "La educacion en Bolivia.
Indicadores,cifras y resultados" ("Educationin Bolivia. Indicators, figures and results") and "La
education en Bolivia. Estadisticas municipales" ("Educationin Bolivia. Municipal Statistics"), as
well as the CD entitled "Informacion estadistica e indicadores escolares (1996-2002) ["(7996-
2002) Statisticalinformationand school indicatorS'].

However, in spite of the progress attained in the implementation of the Educational Reform,
there are persistent equity-related problems, delays in the Reform's design and implementation
at the elementary and high school levels. Access to high school is still low, given that only half
of the population aged 14 through 17 attends high school, a situation that is explained by the
problems related to the elementary level and the insufficient school offer at the high school
level. At the initial or elementary level, access is low given that only one fourth of the children
aged 4 through 5 attend elementary school, probably due to the scarce number of schools,


                                                  75

faculty and the perception on the part of society of the negligible importance of school
performanceat the initial level.

Deficiencies may also be observed in the areas of alternative and technical education, and
delays in the design and implementationof a Reformstrategy for the Higher EducationalLevel.

For the education sector, fiscal year 2003 was a transition year between the conclusion of the
first stage of the Educational Reform and the identification of new educational policy guidelines
for the upcoming decade. The Ministry of Education has been working on a proposal for a
Bolivian Education Strategy, whose preliminary version was submitted for consideration to the
organizations of civil society at the departmental meetings and national workshops held at the
end of fiscal year 2004.

Likewise the Ministry of Education is implementing the 2004-2008 Multi-Annual Operational
Program (POMA for its Spanish acronym), which sets forth the need to develop new planning,
execution, management and integral evaluation processes, strengthening the management
capacity of the Ministry and SEN, incorporating an organizational culture based on the results
approach,which effectively contributesto the reductionof access, permanence and quality gaps
among different population sectors; promoting the full exercise of citizenship rights; ensuring
democratic participation and the shared responsibility of society in the educational process;
improving SEN'S institutional management capacity and improving the learning - teaching
process, articulating the curriculum in all areas, levels and modalities, providing adequate
infrastructureand equipment and improvingfaculty training and performance.

The actionsforeseen within the framework of the SSPC respond to the sectoral policy approach
set forth by the Ministry, which shall contribute to the attainment of general objectives and the
implementationof strategic guidelines.


Strengtheningeducationalcounciis

The first objective is to strengthen the operation of educational councils as a permanent
participation model, contributing to the institutionalization of participatory democracy in
education. The actions may be synthesized as follows: i) Creation and organization of the
National Education Council's operation (CONED for its Spanish acronym); ii) Development of
operation regulations for educational councils; iii) Invitation to the Second National Education
Congress and; iv) Preparation and approval of the Multi-Annual Operational Program (POMA)
for the 2004-2008 period, which incorporates policies within the framework of the Millennium
Development Goals.


The National Education Council (CONED) is the highest social participation instance in
education endowed with the attribution of designing and guiding the sector's public policies. Its
activities began in January 2004. It is a citizen's council composed by 85 of the country's civic,
union, social and educational institutions and organizations. CONED'S directive body is
composed by 16 membersthat representthe different organizations and institutions.


Through an intense consensus-building initiative, CONED prepared the guidelines, topics,
methodology and the invitation to the National Education Congress, which was conceived as a


                                                76

participatory analysis, reflection and debate process on Bolivian education in all areas,
environmentsand levels,with the purpose of agreeing on educational public policies for the next
fifteen years. The process development comprised three phases: i) reorganization of
Departmental Educational Councils (CODED for its Spanish acronym) and organization of
workshops in the nine departments;; ii) organization of twelve national thematic workshops and
eight departmental education congresses (the Congress in La Paz was not held due to political
and union-related problems); iii) carrying out the plenary phase of the Congress and the design
of the new proposalfor the EducationLaw.


On the other hand, POMA is the strategy for the education sector, and it responds to the need
of formulating policies, objectives, strategies and indicators in an integral and articulated
manner for the different levels, areas and modalities of education, science and technology,
becoming an instrumentto advance compliancewith the sector's MDGs.


POMA defines actions within the framework of the sectoral approach, and it will allow mobilizing
funding under the SWAP modality and developing actions that will permit greater articulation
between SEN'Sdifferent areas and levels, establishing the sector's mainfunctions as its general
objectives and not the educationalareas and levels or the Ministry'sorganizational structure.


Mew highschool cummculum

It is aimed at ensuring the development and articulation of an accredited curriculum that
incorporates intercultural, citizen development, productive competencies and research culture.
With the purpose of lending continuity to change processes and the sector's advances, the
Ministry has defined as a priority the transformation of high school education under a new
educational approach, which proposes a humanistic and technical high school degree that
prepares young people, according to their social and educational profile, for insertion into the
labor market and/or for tertiary higher education.


The bases of this proposal were analyzed and agreed upon with fundamental actors involved in
high school education and technical education in various events: departmental high school
education workshops, and technical education seminars and workshops, as well as in technical
committeeswith the participationof agentsfrom the public and private sectors.


Between May and July 2004, the Ministry of Education carried out a process to build based on a
participatory approach, a strategic plan for high school education. Nine departmental
workshops, three regional workshops and a national meeting were held. The framework
documents of the transformation process prepared with various social actors for the High
School Area since 2000 were presented at these events. The general strategies were agreed
upon as well as the vision and missionfor this level.


A transversal working team was formed, composed by technical personnel from different
directorates' within the Ministry, to design the proposal based on the conclusions,
recommendations and suggestions of the aforementioned events. The project is structured
based on the following components: i) access and permanence, which comprises diversified


                                                77

attendance modalities and specific mechanisms to prevent school desertion; ii) educational
services, which comprises curricular design, faculty development and training, equipment; and
iii) institutional management. The project's document will be concluded by the end of April and
will be presentedfor considerationto the World Bank for the corresponding funding.


Divemiffed educational offer

A diversified educational offer is being proposed to meet the population's differentiated needs,
turning education into one of the main social inclusion mechanisms.To attain this, the definition
of interventionsaimed at increasing the permanenceof boys and girls in the national education
system was foreseen.


The long-term objective is to foster girl access and permanence in schools in the rural area,
through the generalization of successful and sustainable intervention strategies and the
promotion of a change of attitude within the educational community with respect to the
participation of girls at the elementary level. The project foresees the execution of three phases:
i) quantitative and qualitative diagnostic research, which consists on identifying the
municipalitieswith a marginalizedfemale populationand its concomitant factors; ii) Sensitization
at the community level and training for faculty members; and iii) implementation of focalized
interventionsin the municipalities,accordingto the identified needs.


Taking into account the reduction of the component's budget, agreed upon betweenthe Ministry
of Education and the World Bank, it was established that two pilot experiences in focalized
intervention would be conducted, one in the Municipality of Poroma with the Treveris
Foundationand the other with Fe y Alegria in the Municipality of Tiraque. However, the Ministry
of Educationhas ensured interventions in a group of municipalities where there are access and
permanencegaps of boys and girls in elementary education.


3.3 Water and sanitation

The objective of the water and basic sanitation policy is to make a long-term contribution to the
improvement of the population's hygiene and health conditions in the country's rural and peri-
urbanareas.

To attain this objective, the Government proposes increasing the coverage of water and basic
sanitation services through the application of sectoral policies and strategies that promote
institutional transformation to attain equity, economic efficiency, efficiency in corporate

its Spanish acronym), whose main components are InstitutionalReform [New Financial Policy -
management and environmental care. There is a NationalWater and Sanitation Plan (PNASfor

NFP), the Institutional Modernization Program (IMP) and the Institutional Technical Assistance
Mechanism (FUNDASABfor its Spanish acronym).

The purpose of Institutional Reform is to guarantee the sustainability of water and sanitation
projects and channel investment funds through the implementationof the New Financial Policy
(NFP). Within this context, the NFP will allow applying transparent funding mechanisms
adequate to the population's payment capacity, under economic efficiency and management
premisesfor Water and SanitationService Companies (EPSAsfor its Spanish acronym).


                                                 78

On the other hand, it intends to increase the efficiency and quality of water and sanitation
services through the implementation of the Institutional Modernization Program (IMP) that will
allow improving service management models (managementloperation)of municipal companies.
Under an offer approach for each EPSA, concessionaland conditionalfunding shall be awarded
for the execution of Integral Development Plans (IDP) for the services provided by companies
that meet the minimumeligibilityconditions and are subject to IMP.

The execution of the New Financial Policy (NFP) and Institutional ModernizationProgram (IMP)
requiresthe promulgation of a legal and institutional framework that will promote efficiency and
sustainability in service provision, which mainly increases the flow of investments and
technology transfer within the sector.

Through the Technical Assistance component it intends to promote the community's effective
participation in the development process for the social plan's viability and sustainability. To that
effect the creation of FUNDASAB was foreseen to support institutional transformation and the
integral improvement of the suppliers of water and sanitation services (EPSAs) and the
Municipal Governments.Within this context,the roles played by FUNDASABshall be: i) support
EPSAs' compliance with the requirements of the different stages established in the IMP, ii)
support the operators' institutionalstrengtheningand; iii) promote effective social participation.

FUNDASAB, in addition to allowing the development of local capabilities for the identification
and managementof the projects'cycle, shall support EPSA's institutionalstrengthening, training
of human resourcesand use of appropriate technologies.

The Sectoral Financial Policy and FUNDASAB are reforms supported by the Social Sectors
Programmatic Credit - SSPC of the WB and KfW. Compliance with the objective shall be
verified through the Sectoral Information System (SIAS for its Spanish acronym), which
constitutes a sectoral planning instrument, for the timely and transparent dissemination of
nationalpoliciesand norms.

3.4 Social Protection Network

The Bolivian Government considers that the creation of conditions aimed at reducing social
tension to strengthen governance and foster economic recovery constitute a priority. To that
effect it has decided to establish the Social Protection Network as a coordination and
focalization instrument for public sector interventions for the benefit of the most impoverished
population.

The Social Protection Network is aimed at integrating information about beneficiaries and
programs directed to the most vulnerable population sectors, such as the National Emergency
Employment Plan (PLANE) and the IntegralCare Programfor Boys and Girls under the age of 6
(PAN), at the same time, it manages the Program to Fight against Poverty and Support Social
Investment (PROPAIS). The Social Protection Network is under the direction of the Directorio
Unico de Fondos (DUF), which depends from the Popular Participation Ministry. Taking into
account the concepts of Social Protectionthat currently exist, it intends to change the sense of
conditionality of the Social Protection Network, so as to ensure the focalization of scarce
resourcesas well as the effectiveness thereof.

To improvethe living conditions of poor people up to the year 2015, all the policiesaimed at this
population group must be aimed at complying with the Millennium Development Goals. An


                                                79

instrument for this purpose is the National Compensation Policy (PNC for its Spanish
acronym) that was established by the Dialogue Law as a State policy that supports the BPRS
and decentralization, through the adequate ordering of transfers to the municipalities. Three
aspectswere identifiedwithin the Social Protectioncomponent:


Guldethelntergovemmental transmrpolicy towardscompliance with the
MDGs

There is a proposalthat modifiesthe PNC that is called ConditionedTransfer Policy (PTC for its
Spanish acronym).), which intends to simplify and harmonize the conditions imposed by
different donors and funding sources to provide a transparent service to the municipalities,
streamlinethe proceduresand have a single system to process projects.

To sum up, the PTC introduces a different resource allocation logic, modifying the notion of
acquired rights, over indicative amounts for municipal governments, to a new logic of
preferential access to resources in adherence to sectoral development indicators in each
municipality.

For an adequate implementationof the PTC, the conduction of a pilot test was foreseen during
this year. To that effect the health sector was selected and two goals were identified: infant
mortality and maternal mortality.The allocationof resourcesfrom the Ministry of Health-World
Bank to the FPS is requiredin order to implementthis action.

Createandimplement a Social ProtectionNetwork

The Government has begun formulating an Integral Social Protection Strategy (RIPS for its
Spanish acronym).)that agglutinates a series of existing initiatives so the beneficiaries enjoy
the interventions that affect them in several aspects. The groups identified for the RIPS are: i)
Children under the age of 5; ii) Children between the ages of 6 and 18; iii) Unemployed or
underemployedpersons; iv) Adults aged 65 and older; and v) Disabled persons. To take care of
the most vulnerable sectors, a decision was adopted to cover only the people identified in the
aforementionedgroups that live in extreme poverty conditions.

For the approval of RIPS, the acceptance of this strategy by various sectors is required and a
political instance is needed to coordinate this work. In this regard, under CONAPE Resolution
No. 02/2005 dated April 19, 2005, the Consejo Nacional de Politica Economica (CONAPE) is
defined as the leading institution for Social Protection Policies in Bolivia. In addition, according
to Supreme Decree No. 27331 from January 2004, it was agreed that the Ministerio de
Participacion Popular supervises the work of the Directorio Unico de Fondos (DUF) which is
responsiblefor the developingof the Social Protection IntegralNetwork.

On the other hand, it was agreed to incorporatethe interventions in the nutrition area as part of
the social protection interventions. In spite of the fact that empirical evidence shows the
importanceof adequate nutritionto break the vicious circle of poverty, above all among children
under the age of 3 and pregnant women, nutritional policies were not prioritized in the public
agenda, due to the absence of leadership in this area. To overcome this problem, the National
Food and Nutrition Council (CONANfor its Spanish acronym) was created, with the purpose
of assuming a leading role in the design and implementation of nutrition and food security
policies.


                                                80

The Ministry of Health and Sports is part of CONAN and its assigned task until May 2005,
consists of preparing and implementing an integral plan of nutritional interventions in the 25
municipalities where children under the age of 3 and pregnantwomen are exposed to nutritional

The activities established in the "Nutritional improvement plan in 26 prioritized municipalities
throughout Bolivia" will be executed by the Ministry of Health and Sports through the Health
Service Directorate/National Food and Nutrition Program and the Health Reform Project/
EXTENSA The National Program's operations will be carried out through Departmental Health
services and the municipalitiesthat participatein this initiative:

      6. Development of a reference and counter reference network for severe and moderate
          malnourishment.

Improve PLANEIS effectiveness

Given the improvement of macroeconomic indicators during 2004, the Government decided to
reduce PLANE'Simportance, taking into considerationthat it was an emergency program that
extended over almost 4 years. That is why for PLANE-Ill, which comprises the June 2004 to
December2005 period, the goal is to pay a total of approximately 200,000 salaries.

3.5 Monitoringand participatoryevaluation of Millennium DevelopmentGoals

The social agenda intends to reinforce the objectives and actions of the social policy aimed at
attaining the Millennium Development Goals, in three prioritized social sectors: health,
education and water and basic sanitation. Due to this, the monitoring and progress evaluation
activities in connection with these Goals constitute an essential instrument for the
implementationof sectoral actions.

Within the framework of the SSPC, this component defines the following objectives: i) Timely
accessibility of budget information corresponding to the three prioritized social sectors; ii)
Ensuring the provision of information to monitor the MDGs, consolidating an integrated
statistical information system; iii) Including the users' opinion in the evaluation of the program's
three prioritizedsectors; iv) Developing institutionalcapacity to evaluate the progresstoward the
attainment of the main indicators relatedto the MDGs.

Socialsector%budget information

The Finance Ministry, through its Accounting General Directorate, has information
corresponding to the social sectors' budget execution at the different administrative levels
(central, departmental and municipal), which is disaggregated by functions and economic
classification of expenditures.This information may be accessed by all users and is utilized with
the purpose of improving budget and programmatic planning. Additionally, it makes available

details of the accounts generated under HlPC II, showing disbursements and executions at the
municipallevel.

SIGMA is currently in the evaluation stage and the instance responsible for the implementation
thereof will make the required adjustments to improve the system. Operation Manuals are in
place and progress was made with respect to the incorporation of decentralized entities to
adjust their informationto the formats requiredby SIGMA.

Disseminationof1nlkn"tion fromMDGsmonitonhgactivitles

The instances responsiblefor the generationand analysis of statistical information relatedto the
MDGs (essentially INE and UDAPE) are currently disseminating socio-demographic, sectoral
and financial indicators that allow evaluating progresstowards the attainment of the established
goals. In an inter-institutional coordination scheme, information is processed and updated, in
order to integrate relevant information. Articulation also incorporates the social sectors, through
its management registrationsystems (SIE and SNlS for education and health, respectively),the
harmonization and standardization of indicators and variables will allow having a more reliable
and timely system that will be useful for decision making in the public sector and will allow
consolidating civil society's participation as a co-responsible instance for the country's
advancementof MDGs.


Participatomevaluationofsocialprograms

Complementary to the follow up and quantitative evaluation systems for MDGs, the
Government's objective is to incorporate into its public policy decisions, the evaluation of
education, health and water and basic sanitation services from the users' standpoint as a
qualified opinion concerningthe provisionof these services.

With this purpose, an independent and highly qualified institution will collect the information
corresponding to these three services from the Citizens Report Cards (LCC for its Spanish
acronym), designed based on users' focus groups, so its implementation allows incorporating
the perceptions and requirements of excluded population groups with the possibility of
differentiatingthese opinions accordingto intercultural or gender aspects.

Resultswill be disseminatedto the different instances involvedin the provision of these services
as well as civil society with the purpose of promoting positive changes in the evaluated
programs.

Based on the results of applying the selected methodology, the Government has foreseen
launching actions to lend continuity to the process, ensuring social participation in the provision
of services and complementing the technical evaluations of sectoral progress towards the
attainmentof MDGs.

Institutionalcapacity tomonitor theprogress of MDGs

The Bolivian Government is currently prioritizing Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) within
its social policy. To that effect, the Inter-institutional Committee on Millennium Development
Goals (CIMDM for its Spanish acronym) was created, through Multi-ministerial Resolution
004/2004 dated May 14, 2004. This Committee is led by UDAPE with the participation of the


                                                 82

social sectors (health, education and water and basic sanitation) and includes the National
Statistics Institute (INE) and the Vice Ministries of Public Investment and External Funding and
Budget and Accounting.

CIMDM's commitment for May 2005 is to conduct a technical evaluation of the progress made
toward the attainment of MDG's that includes the identification and relationships between
information systems and funding requirements. Likewise, the results of this analysis shall be
discussed at a participatory event with the presence of international cooperation organizations
and instances of civil society to achieve strategic alliances and coordinate actions. To that
effect, Bolivia's 2003 - 2004 Progress Report on Millennium Development Goals was
completed, underscoring not only the progress of the indicators but the evolution of sectoral
policies and the execution of public resourcesfor programs relatedto these goals.

The Committee constitutes a relevant instance due to its technical, proposition-oriented and
supportive nature; the results of this work will be reported to the pertinent authorities offering
recommendationsto improve sectoral policies aimed at advancing MDGs.

         ANNEX 4: BOLIVIA'S EXPERIENCEPROGRESSINRESULTS-BASED
               MANAGEMENTOR INSETTINGAND TRACKING TARGETS
         While, in Bolivia, one cannot say that there i s a results-based management system in
place, there have been several years of experience in the setting and tracking of performance
targets.'   The advances have been most noteworthy in the health sector, but the focus on
developing a Poverty Reduction Strategy has generated a more widespread interest in the setting
and tracking of targets.           In addition, new groups (particularly within civil society and
governmental institutions) that have an interest inlooking at results have sprung up.
         Initial Efforts. There have been several efforts to set and track targets related to
development outcomes in Bolivia. Bolivia's initial efforts at identifying results and establishing
performance targets began with the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC I)                     initiative and were
later taken up again as a central part of the progress review conducted during the Consultative
Group (CG) meetings in 1998. The objectives of these C G meetings focused on the design of a
comprehensive development plan in which participation of the international donor community
was re-oriented towards supporting greater results-based work inBolivia.
         As a result of the CG meetings, performance indicators and target goals were agreed
upon based explicitly on the results of a broad consultative process held with Bolivia's civil
society called the National Dialogue I.Progress towards meeting these targets were reviewed at
the CG meetings. Indeed, the documents prepared for the CG meetings placed considerable
emphasis on tracking this progress. In August of 2000, both the Government and the
international donors were pleased to see that 16 out of the 17 core targets were met. One month
later, Bolivia experienced one of the worst periods of social unrest in the last 15 years. This
drove home forcefully the lesson that if targets are to be used to measure progress in the country,
the particular set of indicators chosen must reflect the full range of concerns and interests of
stake-holders. Clearly, the 17 indicators agreed upon between the Government of Bolivia and
internationaldonors did not reflect the broader concerns o f stakeholders.)
         Later, in 2001, the Government prepared a Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) that again
placed considerable emphasis on meeting key targets. Bolivia`s PRS established, among other
goals, a goal of reducing poverty levels from the current level o f 63 percent to 41 percent by
2015. Of course, at this level of aggregation, it would be difficult to identify all the actions that
would be required to meet this goal. Therefore, in addition to the overarching goal of poverty
reduction, the PRS established three sets of indicators - impact, intermediate and results.
Drawing upon the lessons from the social unrest of 2000, the PRS placed greater emphasis on
improved participatory evaluation mechanisms and processes. The follow-up to the PRS and the
definition of these indicators i s currently being managed b y an inter-institutional government
committee (CISE) that i s working with the citizen oversight committees that together make up
the NationalMechanismof Social Control (NMSC).
         The implementation o f the CDF in Bolivia strengthened the focus on results in the public
sector and the donor community. By 2000, Bolivia was already known as one of the two


1. The advances to date with a comprehensive results-based management approach have been limited, principally
because of the difficulty of introducing public sector reform into a system where political patronage remains strong.
See the Draft Report from the U.K.'s Development Strategies entitled Results-based public management in Bolivia
and dated October, 2002. That report states that "results-based public expenditure management is based on a system
of performance measures, selection of targets, evaluation and verification and monitoring.. .. However, it requires a
minimally effective bureaucracy, especially in personnel management, budgeting and financial controls.           The
Bolivian public administration does not meet these minimumrequirements.. .."

 countries that had made the most overall progress among all CDF countries. The Operations
 Evaluation Department carried out a multi-partner evaluation of Bolivia's progress concerning
 the principles of the CDF. With regard to a focus on results, the development of information
 systems has been impressive in the last few years (a summary of the production of statistical
 information i s provided in Box. 1) and there has been some progress in elaborating mechanisms
 to track development results.
1BOX   I.  InformationSystyems
           Ingeneral, the production of statistical information is carried out inconjunction with the organizations that
 make up the National System of Statistical Information. The actual production of basic statistical information in
 Bolivia is realized principally by the National Institute of Statistics (Instituto Nacional de Estadistica, INEi), the
 Economic Analysis Policy Unit (Unidad deAna`lisisde Politicas Econdmicasy Sociales,UDAPE), and the sectoral
 ministries. Raw data is obtained through the national censuses, surveys, and administrative registers which, in turn,
 are compiled from health centers, educational units, ministries, municipal offices, and some public companies.
I
           The Instituto Nacional de Estadistica(INE) collects and maintains all data sources for poverty reduction
 efforts. There are two principal data sources used for measuring and monitoring poverty in Bolivia: a national
 census (of which the last installment was in 2001) and various household surveys. The national census (Censo
 Nacional de Poblacion y Vivienda),carried out approximately every ten years, provides data on non-monetary
 indicators of well-being which is thenused for buildingpoverty maps and targeting government interventions using
 the concept of Unmet Basic Needs (NecesidadesBasicasInsatisfechas or NBI).The INE-UDAPE-Censo2001
 recently provided an update of the country's NBI-based poverty map (2002).

           Inaddition to this census, Bolivia's INEhas implemented over the years a number of multi-purpose
 household surveys. Until 1995, INEcarried out the Encuesta Integrada de Hogares in Bolivia's larger cities. The
 key results for the 1989-1995 period are available on CD-ROM, and standardized data files for selected years have
 been prepared by CEPAL. In 1996 and 1997,INEimplemented three rounds of the EncuestaNacional de Empleo
 (June 1996,November 1996, and November 1997).These surveys had national coverage. The November 1997
 survey is the richest in terms of content because it contains detailed modules on education and health.
           InMarch 1999,INEimplementedthe Encuesta Continua de Hogares again in Bolivia's larger cities. The
 survey provided information on both income and, to a lesser degree, expenditures. Then, in November 1999, INE
 implementedthe Encuesta Continua de Hogares - Condicionesde Vidaat the national level. This survey benefited
 inpart from the support of the MECOVIprogram. The range of questions inthis 1999 survey is more
 comprehensive than in previous surveys due to modules on health, education, occupation, income, and expenditures.
 The module on expenditures has been particularly useful for future poverty monitoring.

           These surveys are not always comparable due to changes over time in the questionnaires and the fact that
 some of surveys have only been implemented in large urban areas only, making it difficult to establish national
 poverty trends in Bolivia in the 1990s. Some additional information for rural areas is also available in two surveys
 conducted in 1993 and 1997 by Bolivia's social investment fund (Fondo de Inversion Social, FIS). But these surveys
 are not fully representative of rural areas so results should be treated with caution.
           INEcurrently fields the EncuestaContinua de Hogares- Condicionesde Vidaregularly and at a national
 level. Its advantagesare principally that instead of income, expenditures are the preferred indicator of well-being,
 and the use of the survey to compute the cost of basic food and non-food needs.
           Since October of 1999,Bolivia has participated in the MECOVI (Mejoramiento de las Encuestasy la
 Medicion de las Condicionesde Vida en America Latina y el Caribe)program coordinated jointly by CEPAL, the
 Inter-American Development Bank, and the World Bank. Among its aims are to improve the system of household
 surveys, improve the use of surveys for poverty targeting, and strengthen the institutional capacity of member
 countries to analyze the survey data for policy and project design. In Bolivia, MECOVI assisted INEin its efforts to
 create an Integrated System of Household Surveys as part of the strategy of statistical information to combat
 poverty.



           There have also been some additional efforts to set and track targets within specific
 sectors inBolivia. But more progress has been made inthe health sector than in any other sector,
                                                             96

largely as a result of a strong results-orientation given to the Bank's Health Sector Reform
program, APL-1, which emphasized results and improved accountability by setting out yearly
targets for different performance indicators. Performance agreements set targets on 15
performance indicators in the sector. The process was based on a mechanism by which the
MDGsrelatedto healthcan be made operational at both the regional and district levels.
          Despite the increased focus on setting and tracking targets, there has been much less
progress made in all the supporting activities needed to make a RBM system work in Bolivia.
For example, there i s little connection between the setting of targets and the preparation of the
Health Ministry's Annual Operating Plans, or between the setting of targets and the budgetary
allocations, or between the setting of targets and the design of externally-financed development
programs. One reason why more progress has not been achieved i s that there i s no clear idea of
the precise actions that need to take place inorder to achieve results.
          Linking Policy Actions to Results. The problem of making explicit the causal links
between actions and results i s not specific to Bolivia, but i s common in all countries. InBolivia,
the Bank recently started supporting an initiative to analyze more explicitly how improvements
in different indicators might be achieved through a more systematic approach to the analyses of
problems, the design of policy responses and the implementation of priority actions. The
government, PROCOSI (the major health NGO) and the Bank are developing operational
systems to track targets and monitor intermediate indicators. The progress to date i s discussed in
Box 2.

Box 2. Attributing Outcomes to Policy Actions
          The World Bank has been helping the government develop a system dynamics approach as a way of
developing rather complex, graphic, structural models of these dynamic relations in a given system easily and
intuitively. A system dynamics approach i s particularly useful since a result is rarely due to a single action. Even in
simple cases, results depend on a multitude of policy actions-each with its own dynamic path-that                 affect
outcomes within that system. The approach also allows for the representation of the dynamic aspects of feedback
effects and time lags in a system and helps avoid the difficulty o f keeping multiple dynamic relationships in one's
head. I t also offers important benefits for planning and for monitoringand evaluation activities.

          To date, the government, the World Bank and PROCOSI have finished a model that analyzes the relations
between health sector policies and underlying epidemiological risks that together determine the prevalence of
malaria in the country. The model takes into account the feedback between infected individuals and the rate of
transmission of the disease, as well as the actions undertaken and the government's planned 2001-05 strategic sector
plan, and also tracks the costs and financing needs contemplated by the plan. Socioeconomic factors that affect, say,
the responses by different groups to a diagnosis and treatment program can be factored into the model. Similarly,
exogenous factors that may affect the outcome, but may not be amenable to public policy, can be incorporated.

          Progress has also been made in modeling the relation between policy actions and infant and maternal
mortality and infectious disease outcomes. Finally, there is an effort underway to analyze the relations between
educational policy decisions and outcomes.



          Recent Efforts. Over the last few months the Government has taken important steps to
set relevant country targets -most            of them are aligned to the MDGs, others reflect the result of
the National Dialogue on productive issues-                  develop the mechanisms to accurately monitor
them, and identify the actions needed to accelerate progress towards reaching them subject to
current financial restrictions.
          The most noteworthy effort i s the recent creation of an Inter-institutional Committee on
Tracking the MDGs. This Committee i s made of representatives of UDAPE and INE and
different line ministries, including the ministries o f Health, Education and Service and Public
                                                           97

Works. The Bank has been supporting this effort through this series of Social Sector
Programmatic Credits (SSPC). The Committee has already defined and agreed on a set of 17
indicators to be tracked (5 impact indicators, 6 result indicators and 6 intermediate indicators). It
will now work on identifying causal links between public policies and outcomes, costing policy
alternatives, coordinating funding initiatives and periodically disseminate progress made.
        There i s also an effort to integrate statistical information systems. INE and sector
ministries are working on inter-institutional agreements to validate sector administrative records
and to agree on a common methodology to carry out the projection of population. Some donor-
aid agencies have already expressed their interest in funding the unification of existing
information systems. The government intends to develop a system that will allow the
measurement of results at all levels (national and sub-national), develop further financial
management systems and improve connectivity at the municipal level.

 ANNEX 5: BOLIVIA'SNATIONALDIALOGUEAND THE POVERTYREDUCTION
                                           STRATEGY

        Inthe year 2000, the Government of Bolivia convened a national dialogue for the design
of a poverty reduction strategy, which concluded with the preparation and subsequent approval
of the Bolivian Poverty Reduction Strategy. This strategy allowed Bolivia to be one of the first
countries complying with the requirements of debt alleviation through the HPC I1mechanism.
Subsequently, on July 31, 2001, the government enacted the National Dialogue Law (National
Decree No. 2235), mandatingthe Executive Branch to convene, at least once every three years, a
national dialogue involving a wide variety of civil society organizations to discuss policy
alternatives to reduce poverty.
        As mandated by the law, the objective of the Bolivia National Dialogue is to agree and
promote the institutionalization of productive, economic and social strategies with a
comprehensive focus to guide economic policy and reduce poverty at the municipal,
departmental and national levels. Indoing so, it must recognize the intercultural character of the
country and promote social equity and inclusion. The results of the dialogue should become a
major input in the definition of the country's Poverty Reduction Strategy and subsequent
implementation through a variety of instruments ( e g        PRSCs and other programmatic and
investment operations).
        In order to lead this participatory process, a pro-tempore working group, called the
Technical Secretariat of the Dialogue, was created. This Secretariat i s in charge o f the design,
development and execution of the National Dialogue and i s devoted entirely to promote
consultative processes with citizens and organizations. A National Board of Directors for the
Dialogue has been established through a supreme decree, including a number o f civil society
organizations in order to create a greater space for civil society participation. Its role i s to design
the objectives, methodology and schedule of the National Dialogue. Also, it acts as the instance
responsible to conduct the Dialogue: it conveys for its initiation, defines the agenda and invites
participants.   The Minister of Popular Participation i s in charge of presiding the Board of
Directors of the National Dialogue.
        On September 2003, the Board o f Directors and the Technical Secretariat of the Bolivia
National Dialogue were established to implement the methodology and agenda for the 2003
Dialogue. The social and political conflicts of October 2003, however, delayed the Dialogue
agenda. On November 20, 2003, the National Dialogue -focusing mainly on the productive
sector and called the "Productive National Dialogue"- was reinstalled. The national dialogue
proceeds infour stages:
(a) Pre-Dialogue: it was the first stage of the National Dialogue in which social organizations
    had the chance to consult with their constituencies the preparation of a Comprehensive
    Productive Strategy (CPS). This stage started on February 12, 2004 and there were 53 such
    pre-dialogues around the country.
(b) Municipal Dialogue: once the Pre-Dialogue was concluded, a series of dialogues at the
    municipal level took place in the 314 municipalities of the country. Municipal government
    representatives and overseeing committees agreed on municipal CPSs and defined the
    guidelines for the preparation of participatory budgets.

(c) Departmental Dialogues were held in the 9 Depurtumentos in Bolivia with representatives
    of the municipal discussion tables, the departmental executive branch and the departmental
    councils, congressmen, civic committees, universities, professional associations, NGOs and
    networks of civil society organizations.
(d) National Dialogue, the final stage of the process, was convened on December 21 and 22,
    2004. During the two days, representatives of the municipal and departmental discussion
   tables, parliamentary discussion tables, executive branch and representative organizations of
    the national level, in addition to the Board of Directors of the Dialogue jointly with NGOs
    and other networks, defined the country's CPS, its implementation plan and needed changes
   to the norms and regulations. In the national table 302 representatives of productive and
    social organizations in the country as well as 200 guests from sectors with some relationship
    to the topics on the table took part in the different committees and established a set of
   priorities:  (a) agroindustry, agriculture, ganaderia and fruticultura; (b) biodiversity and
   biocommerce; (c) tourism and handicrafts; (d) trade in borders; (e) gas; (f) manufacturing;
    (g) development of a new miningindustry; (h) forest development. Tourism was named one
   of the top five priorities in all the Depurtumentos in Bolivia. Establishing these priorities
   will require changes in the legal, institutional, fiscal, and financial frameworks in the
   country, and given the magnitude of such changes they will be handled in Congress or during
   the upcoming constitutional assembly.         This national dialogue was centered almost
   exclusively on the productive sector, as the previous one was almost entirely dedicated to the
    social sectors (see Box 3)
        The process of developing a DNBP has had many positive aspects, but also raised some
concerns:
   Even though there was ample participation from all the sectors in society, the heterogeneity
   in the level of information and knowledge of the different actors resulted in varying degrees
   of participation.
   The methodological proposal i s rather weak, and since the work was done under severe time
   constraints and with a large number of participants the conclusions were somewhat vague
    and the scope broad. The discussions veered towards issues outside the original areas o f
   discussion, like defaulting on the external debt, redistribution of HIPC resources, and other
   issues over which there was no mandate to discuss.
   The productive strategies that were discussed and agreed upon contain a high level of
   abstraction, and there were no operational or practical guidelines for their implementation.
   These comprehensive productive strategies were meant to become the centrepiece in the
   revisedBolivian strategy for poverty reduction.
   Even though the National Dialogue i s an important instrument for participation, there are
   some concerns that social conflicts could increase instead of the opposite, as this mechanism
   has created numerous expectations and demands on the side of the population that may be
   hard to fulfil.
   An additional issue that has had little discussion is the legitimacy of the social organizations
   represented in the National Dialogue. Many organizations suffer from the same problems for
   which political parties have been severely criticized in the past: lack o f internal democracy,
   authoritarianism, disconnect with the supporters base.

        Not only for its objective but also for its scope, this National Dialogue i s different from
the one that took place in the year 2000. This i s due not just because this time there are no new
resources for debt relief such as the HIPC Iand HIPC 11, but also because the current goal i s to
re-direct the use of existing funds and those committed by the International Cooperation through
the revision of the Poverty Reduction Strategy with a productive focus, posing recommendations
that would allow the design and application of specific policies oriented to the economic and
productive reactivation o f the country.
        During the evaluation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy, problems with the design and
implementation were identified. The main critical aspects inthe design were the lack of strategic
prioritization of demands and goals which resulted in a dispersion of efforts, diminishing the
possibilities of a short term impact, and the concentration in the use of public investment
resources neglecting alternative promotion instruments to the micro, small and medium
enterprise. On the implementation side, there was concerned over the low execution levels of
HIPC I1resources due mainly to institutional weaknesses at various levels of government. It i s
not clear that the just finished National Dialogue has addressed these problems, or that the draft
PRSP prepared by the Government has taken these recommendations into account.
        The observations to the Poverty Reduction Strategy, however, go even further as some
reports consider that: ". ..officially, the original BPRS i s still in effect, but that the great majority
of the Bolivians either are not aware or consider it a "dead" document". The implementation of
the strategy (in a recessive economic climate anda tense social climate) has not achieved poverty
reduction as measured by income or expenditure and few have confidence in that the strategy
could solve the economic problems of the country. In October 2003, the national government
distributed a revised proposal of the BPRS. The population awaits a 2003 National Dialogue to
discuss this proposal and also to discuss issues pending from the preparation of the BPRS (critics
to the current economic model and concerns on land titling and national resource
distribution.. .).'"

                             Box 3: Processes of NationalDialogue Iand I1

I n an effort to move towards more open and participatory policy planning, the Government convened a country-wide
consultative process in 1997 called the National Dialogue which brought together different sectors of society to
discuss Government plans and public policy objectives. Subsequent and successiverounds of this National Dialogue
were envisioned, each expected to build upon the results of the previous rounds.
The National Dialogue I.InOctober of 1997, the Government convened the first National Dialogue which brought
together representatives from the business community, the church, civil society organizations, labor groups, NGOs,
and universities, with the Government and opposition parties also participating. Despite some shortcomings, the
dialogue produced various positive outcomes and resulted in agreements to support a program to reduce poverty and
boost economic growth. This led to the 1997-2002 government plan which was based on four pillars - opportunity,
equity, dignity, and institutional reform - corresponding to activities to promote sustainable growth, social
development, drug eradication and institutional strengthening.

Against this backdrop, the Government prioritized social spending and began implementing programs aimed at
alleviating poverty. Although the Government made substantial efforts to implement this strategy, little follow-up
was done before the inauguration of the secondNational Dialogue in 2000.

The NationalDialogue 11. The secondNational Dialogue was launched in April of 2000 to promote a participatory
approach in the preparation of Bolivia's PRSP. In the months preceding the Dialogue, various civil society groups
mobilized on their own to prepare their own dialogues. This included the Catholic Church-sponsored Jubilee 2000
Forum of NGOs and included groups representing small producers, indigenous people and miners.

The national dialogue iiwas designed as a bottom-up process with discussions taking place first at the municipal
level, then moving to the departmental and national levels. Four topics were discussed at the municipal level:
determinants of poverty, mechanisms for the allocation of HPC debt relief resources, citizens' participation in
monitoring the use of HPC resources, and carrying out a follow-up of the national dialogue. Departmental
roundtables focused on priority actions at the regional level in the fight against poverty, as well as citizens'
participation in the monitoring of resources for public investment, the content and institutional framework of public
policies, and conducting a follow-up of the national dialogue. Topics discussed at the national level include: support
to production, education, health, basic sanitation and housing, land, and the environment. Some structural issues
were also discussed including tax policy, labor reform, trade policy, and the regulatory environment for businesses.

Agreements were reached on several topics, including: (i)      the determination of priority policy areas (such as
productive infrastructure and support for production, education, health, and land tenure); (ii)the definition of a
mechanism for the distribution of HIPC resources; and (iii)the need to establish social oversight mechanisms
which would give civil society a role in monitoring the utilization of HIPC resources. Based on the results of the
national dialogue ii,the government drafted a full BPRS which was approved by the cabinet in February, 2001,
followed by extensive discussions with civil society. Plans were then made for an extensive follow-up to the BPRS
through existing mechanisms of social oversight at the municipal level, and through newly created agencies of social
oversight at the departmental and national levels. This entire review process was formalized in the new National
Dialogue Law (Ley de Dia'logo Nacional).

But despite these efforts to bring the participatory process closer to people by decentralizing it, NGOs and civil
society groups raised arguments about real participation and representation.

Other instancesof socialparticipation


        After October 2003, the agenda for the current administration included, besides the
National Dialogue, a national referendum about the use of Bolivia's vast natural resources, a
constitutional assembly, the second national congress on education, and the national strategy for
agriculture and rural development. These activities were opportunities to achieve a consensus on
a variety of topics, but in many cases they deepened existing differences among political and
social groups. In addition this process was necessarily slow, and many decisions were delayed
while waiting for a consensusto be reached, which inmany cases didnot happen.
        Binding Referendum on the utilization of gas reserves. On July 18 2004 a national
referendum took place to decide on the future of the natural gas reserves in the country. This
was the first such referendum held in the country, and the citizens had to reply to five questions
on how the government should handle the exploitation of the gas reserves. The government
claimed an ample victory after the referendum, in which the population supported a proposal to
increase state participation in the process of exploitation of the reserves, and an increase of taxes
to foreign companies participating in the business. The results of the referendum also supported
the idea of using the gas reserves as a strategic tool to negotiate an exit to the Pacific Ocean, an
issue that for Bolivia -a     landlocked country-    has always been of utmost importance both
strategically and historically.
        However since the moment the results were announced it became apparent that the
questions had been phrased in a somewhat ambiguous manner, and as such, the results were
subject to interpretation. Some sectors therefore interpreted the popular vote as an argument in
favor of nationalizing the gas and oil companies, other maintained that it was about the revision
of contracts with those companies, but for the government the answer to the results of the
referendum was supposed to provide legitimacy to a plan to increase exports through additional
foreign investments and at the same time reduce the opposition through increasing the state
participation inthe business.
        Based on the results of the referendum the government prepare a draft law of
hydrocarbons that later on had to rewrite, but both versions faced fierce opposition in congress,
where the president does not have a majority o f his own. A third draft was prepared b y the
committee on economic development, but consensus on the latter has not been reached yet.
More than seven months after the referendumthere i s no agreement on a hydrocarbons law.
Other participatoryprocesses
        The second national education congress has been rescheduled three times, mainly
because of the opposition of the teachers union inL a Paz. They argue that the representativeness
of the Ministry of Education at the forum i s larger than that of the teachers, which i s perceived as
an attempt to manipulate the congress. However most of the preparation work and decision
making involved in the congress has been done at the municipal and departmental level, as
described inthe education section of this document.
        There are two other participatory processes are underway or in preparation for the
remainder of the year: (i)a referendum on Departmental autonomy, and (ii)            a constitutional
assembly. The election of Prefects, the top executive power at the Departments, has been set for
June 12th, 2005.



                                                 103

       These two upcoming events open the door to potential conflicts. There are sectors in the
country that perceive a referendum on autonomy at the departmental level as contradictory with
the idea of a constitutional assembly. According to some groups, the issue of autonomy should
be discussed at the assembly, within all other aspects that this may imply, like the redistribution
of resources, an issue that would not come up at the referendum. It may be difficult for the
government to find an intermediate position inthis discussion.

                                           May 26,2005

Economicand political background

1.       Discussions on hydrocarbons policies and regional autonomy raised political tensions in
early 2005, leading President Mesa to offer to resign and call early elections. Congress refused
this offer, and domestic conditions have improved somewhat. Oil companies have expressed
strong opposition to the draft law being discussed inCongress, warning that if approved it could
prompt recourse to international arbitration. More recently, members of the Constitutional
Tribunal introduced uncertainty about the legality of existing oil contracts by stating that these
have not yet been approved by Congress as required. Against this background, the authorities
have reiterated their commitment to reforms and to veto a nonviable hydrocarbons law if
approved by Congress.

2.       Although the economic and financial system remains vulnerable, macroeconomic
developments have been positive in2004 and early 2005, largely reflecting a favorable global
environment. Preliminary data suggest that real GDP growth reached 3.6 percent in 2004,
buoyedb y hydrocarbon and mineral exports. Continued strong performance inthese sectors
should help bring growth to about 4.5 percent in 2005. Inflation has increased-mainly reflecting
higher import prices associated with nominal currency appreciationin neighboring countries and
higher transportation costs due to the fuel price adjustment-but remains around 5 percent. The
fiscal deficit has been reduced to 5.7 percent of GDP in 2004, from more than 8 percent o f GDP
in2003. The externalcurrent account registered a surplusof around3 percent of GDPin2004
and i s expected to remain in surplus in 2005. However, vulnerabilities inthe financial sector are
still significant and the economy remains highly dollarized.

Authorities' program

Inrecent weeks, the authorities have made a renewed effort incoordinating with the international
community. On April 8, after the authorities implemented several important prior actions inthe
fiscal and financial areas, the IMFBoard approved the fifth revision of the 2003 Stand By
Agreement and its extension through end-March 2006. Directors commended the authorities for
keeping the 2004 program on track and welcomed the objectives laid out inthe 2005 program.
They also expressed concern that the fragile social and political situation posed implementation
risksfor the program, and urged the authorities to builddomestic support for their policies,
particularly on hydrocarbons. The Bolivian authorities' program for the year aheadhas four main
elements:

e       Fiscal policy. The fiscal programfor 2005 envisages a deficit after grants of 5% percent
         of GDP, while increasingpro-poor spending by 0.2 percentage points of GDP. To
         compensate for the loss of a one-time tax amnesty revenue in2003-04, the authorities
        have increased fuel excise taxes and reached an agreement with Argentina on higher gas
        exports. Based on preliminary information, the end-March fiscal deficit appears to be
        lower than programmed, reflecting hightax revenues and current expenditure restraint.
        The program also envisages the adoption o f a new Organic Budget Law and a tax reform.

e       Financingissues. Pledges at alate 2004 donors meeting inL a Paz and IF1support are
        broadly inline with Bolivia's concessional financing requirements for 2005. The
        financing of the fiscal deficit relies heavily on the use of external concessional loans and
        grants, limiting the use of net nonconcessional financing to 1.5 percent of GDP. Timely
        disbursements from bilateral donors and IFIs-including those related to the Bank's
        Social Sector Programmatic Credit-would limit the use of temporary central bank
        financing.

e       Monetary and financialissues. The authorities have taken key steps to protect the
        financial system and reduce risks. They built up reserves significantly above programmed
        levels in 2004, eliminated forbearance on loan classification and provisioning, removed
        regulatory powers of the Ministry of Finance over the financial system, and introduced a
        norm for the gradual phase-in of additional provisions. Looking ahead, in light of high
        financial dollarization, the 2005 program envisages a further reserve build up. The
        authorities have also announced increases inreserve requirements for foreign currency
        deposits. In addition, they intendto improve the foreign exchange auction system, take
        steps toward a proper bank resolution scheme, and privatize banks where the public
        sector holds a majority stake.

e       Hydrocarbonspolicyand medium-termsustainability.The approval of a
       hydrocarbons law consistent with the efficient exploitation of Bolivia's rich hydrocarbon
       resources i s critical for debt sustainability, growth, and poverty reduction over the
        medium-term. However, a number of elements o f a draft new hydrocarbons law are
        controversial and highly sensitive and it remains unclear if the Executive and Congress
        will reach a consensus over an acceptable law. Against this background, the authorities
       have reiterated their commitment to exercise veto power if an unviable law i s approved
       by Congress. We welcome the continued efforts by the World Bank to help the
        authorities on this issue.
