IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
INDONESIA
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
(Loan No. 3180-IND)
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Rural Electrification Project in
Indonesia, for which Loan No. 3180-IND, in the amount of US$ 329 million equivalent was approved on
March 22, 1990 and made effective on July 30, 1990. In addition, under a Japanese Grant Agreement (TF
27280), a Yen 180 million grant was provided to supplement loan funds available for technical assistance.
The loan closing date was extended by one year, to June 30, 1995 (original closing date was June
30, 1994). About US$ 67.7 million was canceled, and the last disbursement was on November 28, 1995.
Under the Japanese Grant Agreement, about Yen 33.1 million was canceled.
The ICR was prepared by Arun P. Sanghvi (Sr. Energy Economist, Task Manager), Industry and
Energy Division, East Asia and Pacific Region, assisted by Dawn Vermilya, Voravate Tig Tuntivate and
John Tulloch, and reviewed by Peter R. Scherer, Chief, EA3IE, and Richard A. Calkins, Operations
Adviser, EA3DR.
Preparation of this ICR was begun in July, 1995 prior to the Banlk's ICR mission to Indonesia
from October 15 to November 7, 1995. It is based on material in the project file, and interviews with the
task managers and implementing agencies. The aide memoire of the ICR mission is attached as Appendix
A. The borrower's contribution is attached as appendix C.

EVALUATION SUMMARY
INDONESIA
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
(Loan 3180-IND)
A. INTRODUCTION
1.    By the late 1970s, rural electrification (RE) emerged as a specific objective of the Government of
Indonesia's (GOI) development strategy, with the long-term goal to electrify all villages, and enable the
basic service provided by electricity and to reduce the disparity between urban and rural areas. To assist
GOI with its rural electrification program, the Bank completed its first rural electrification initiative in
Indonesia in 1986, by preparing the Rural Electrification Review (Report No. 6144-IND), which laid the
groundwork for the continuing dialogue with the Government on policy issues. Specifically, the report
recommended a program strategy and design which would, over a period of time through continual
interventions, successively decrease the costs of rural electrification delivery, increase benefits of rural
electrification, and increase the extent of cost recovery, by a combination of policy, technical and
institutional measures. These recommendations became the basis for the project under review which was
the Bank's first rural electrification loan for Indonesia. The total amount of the loan was US$ 329.0
mnillion. The loan was signed on April 30, 1990, and became effective on July 30, 1990, and the loan
closing date was extended by one year to June 30, 1995.
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES
2.     The project had two overall objectives. The first objective was to support the construction of
facilities to electrify rural villages. The second objective, which was envisioned as being achieved overtime
through a continuous process, was to create a basis for and support the development of an efficient and
sustainable rural electrification program in Indonesia. The specific objectives of the project were:
i.  To construct facilities to electrify about 4,500 new villages during 1990/91 and 1991/92;
ii. To improve the planning of rural electrification subsector development through strengthening
of the planning capability of sectoral organizations;
iii. To reduce the unit cost of electricity distribution in rural areas through the revision and
adoption of appropriate technical design and construction standards and improved procurement and
construction procedures;
iv. To maximize the economic benefits of rural electrification by increasing productive uses of
electricity by small businesses and by increasing in-village connections;
v. To reduce costs through enhancement of the role of village cooperatives/organizations
implementing and operating the rural power systems; and
vi. To strengthen PLN's and MOCSE's organizational units responsible for rural electrification.

C. IMPLEMENTATION EXPERIENCE AND RESULTS
3.     The overall project implementation results have been satisfactory for both the physical (short-term
objective), and the developmental (long-term) objective. The physical program targets were exceeded.
Actual costs of equipment and materials tumed out to be about 37% lower than the SAR estimate, in-part
because PLN employed lighter and cheaper equipment designs. As a consequence, upon PLN's request the
original scope of the project was expanded in 1992 to finance 6,000 villages in total, and over the period
1990/91 - 1993/94, taking into account PLN's implementation capacity and available financing from other
sources.
4.     The SAR estimate of time from loan signing to physical completion was about 48 months. This
implementation period had to be extended by 12 months, the primary reasons being: (i) expansion of project
scope, from 4,500 villages to 6,000; and (ii) delays in selecting consultants, and protracted and inefficient
procurement procedures for equipment and materials to be used for the original project scope.
5.     The revised intemal economic rate of return (IERR) for the time-slice (1990/91-1994/95), financed
in-part by the Bank, is 15%. By comparison, the SAR estimate of IERR for PLN's five-year Repelita V
rural electrification investment program (1989/90-1993/94), was 12%. The higher ex-post rate of return is
due to lower equipment and material costs realized and a much higher proportion of households connected
relative to the number of villages connected.
6.    The cost savings and changes resulted in a loan cancellation of about US$67.7 million, of which
about US$54.4 million was formally canceled in September 1994 upon the request of the Borrower, and the
remaining undisbursed balance of about US$12.3 million was canceled on November 28, 1995.
D. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS, FUTURE OPERATIONS, AND KEY LESSONS LEARNED
7.     The results of the project have been satisfactory; it met or exceeded most of the major development
objectives, though its implementation experienced delays in procurement and hiring of consultants in the
early stages, and the extent of "absorption" by PLN, associated with the institutional strengthening
objectives of the TA component was below expectation. The project initiated and enriched a policy
dialogue on rural electrification, that has paved the way for more efficient extensification and
intensification of rural electrification in Indonesia under a follow-on project (para 8).
8.     The achievements generated from the project are highly likely to be sustainable.  These
achievements have to be seen in the context of a gradual and continuous learning process leading toward
the goal of creating an efficient and sustainable rural electrification program. For example, changes in
equipment standards and performance specifications and in network design, facilitated by the project,
provide the basis for realizing significant cost reductions in the equipment and material costs of the
physical program in the next stage of rural electrification which is now being carried out under the Bank
financed Second Rural Electrification Project (Loan 3845-IND), that became effective in July 1995. Also,
the positive experience gained with local participation -- in the form of Pola schemes -- and in a pilot
program on productive use promotion, has provided the basis for seeing more ambitious and large scale
promotion of these concepts in the Second Rural Electrification Project.



3
9.     Several key strategic lessons can be drawn from this project that have implications for the design
of future rural electrification projects. These are:
(i) Properly structured local participation can help to significantly lower the cost of rural
electrification: PLN's sub-contracting out a range of mainly labor intensive activities related to the
distribution and customer services functions, to village level organizations on a fee-for-service
basis (the 'Pola program'), has proven to be beneficial for all parties involved. This positive
experience underpins the conclusion that an effective strategy for increasing the efficiency of RE
delivery and its developmental impact is to incorporate in RE projects, programs that will directly
help increase local participation.   Under such programs, private sector village electricity
organizations would assume management responsibility for a wider range of distribution functions
in a given area, which if successful in the ultimate, could entail takeover of all distribution in an
entire service area, including asset ownership.
(ii) PLN must be made financially accountable for its rural electrification program: To
facilitate that PLN achieves rural electrification delivery in an efficient and least cost manner,
while at the same time working to maximize rural electrification benefits and the household
connection rate, it is necessary to establish transparency and financial accountability for the rural
electrification program. Further over a period of time, the Government's financial contributions to
PLN should be phased down and ultimately limited to: (i) cost recovery for efficient expansion of
rural electrification coverage; and (ii) coverage of operating losses, to the extent the Government's
mandated retail tariffs to end users do not cover such costs of efficient and least cost provision.
The Government's effort underway to corporatize PLN  while also creating a multi-operater
environment with private sector participation on a major scale, is expected to bring about the
conditions under which the need for substantially eliminating tariff distortions will become
unavoidable; conditions under which the Government will also find it politically easier to introduce
such changes.

I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Statement/Evaluation of Objectives
1.     The Bank's involvement in Indonesia's rural electrification program began in 1986 with the
preparation of the "Rural Electrification Review" (Report No. 6144-lND). The sector report laid the
groundwork for an ongoing dialogue with GOI to assist in its rural electrification policy formation and to
assist implementation by PLN of an efficient and sustainable rural electrification program based on grid
extension. Specifically, the report recommended a program strategy and design which would over a period
of time through a series of interventions: (i) successively decrease the costs of rural electrification delivery,
bringing them closer in line with best practices; (ii) increase the benefits of rural electrification; (iii)
increase the mobilization of non-governmental resources; and (iv) increase the extent of cost recovery, all
through a combination of policy, technical and institutional measures. These recommendations became the
anchor for the Bank's first rural electrification lending operation -- the Rural Electrification Project ("RE
I", Loan 3180-IND).
2.     The overall objective of the RE I project was to support the development and implementation
of an efficient rural electrification program in Indonesia. This objective was envisioned as being
achieved through a continuous process of improvements, with the RE I project helping trigger the first
phase of this process. All of the specific project objectives to be accomplished during the implementation
period, listed in the following, were clearly stated and each directly supported the overall objective of the
project:
i.  To construct facilities to electrify about 4,500 new villages during 1990/91 and 1991/92;
ii. To improve the planning of rural electrification subsector development through strengthening
of the planning capability of sectoral organizations;
iii. To reduce the unit cost of electricity distribution in rural areas through the revision and
adoption of appropriate technical design and construction standards and improved procurement and
construction procedures;
iv. To maximize the economic benefits of rural electrification by increasing productive uses of
electricity by small businesses and by increasing in-village connections;
v. To reduce costs through enhancement of the role of village cooperatives/organizations in
implementing and operating the rural power systems; and
vi. To strengthen PLN's and MOCSE's organizational units responsible for rural electrification.
3.     The physical targets were achievable since they were in line with PLN's implementation record at
the time of connecting over 2,000 villages annually. Realization of the broader developmental objectives
was well within PLN's ability to achieve over time. However, several factors created weak incentives for
top management as well as rural electrification managers to seek increases in efficiency and reduce costs
for rural electrification delivery, while aggressively expanding rural electrification coverage and household
connections. The major factors potentially inhibiting achieving success were: (i) PLN's organizational
structure that was highly centralized, functionally vertically integrated, and had commingled responsibility
4



5
for urban-industrial electrification operations, which were largely commercial in nature and profitable, as
well as for the subsidized rural electrification operations; (ii) a management approach best characterized as
'top down command and control', that provided little autonomy and accountability and weak incentives for
line managers to seek out efficiency improvements; (iii) a corporate culture overly focused at the time on
power generation; (iv) the extemal environment within which PLN had to function was one in which the
Govemment established new village electrification targets and allocated budget for new investment without
much regard for efficiency; and (v) the Govenmment's policy of nationally uniform retail tariffs resulted in
PLN incurring financial operating losses, especially on RE operations outside Java.
B. Achievement of Objectives
Overall Results
4.     The overall objective to support the development and implementation of an efficient rural
electrification program in Indonesia was substantially achieved and formed the basis for establishing a
sustainable rural electrification program. The physical program targets were exceeded. In addition, the
key project interventions to help steer the rural electrification program design and implementation in the
direction of increasing the efficiency of investment, increasing other benefits of rural electrification, and
pilot efforts to increase resource mobilization from non-govemmental sources, were largely successful.
5.     Rate of return. The intemal economic rate of return (IERR) of PLN's REPELITA V (1989/90-
1993/94) rural electrification investment program was estimated in the SAR at 12%. Revised estimates
show the IERR of the five year time-slice financed in-part by the Bank (1990/91-1994/95), to be 15%.
Tlhe ex-post IERR calculation is presented in Annex D. 1.
6.     Cost savings and changes. Actual costs of equipment and material for the original project scope
of 4,500 villages tumed out to be about 36% lower than the SAR estimate (US$203 million compared to
US$320 million). These savings and cost changes of about US$117 million, can be largely attributed to
the following factors.
*  Smaller poles and lighter conductors than those previously used for rural electrification were
used in the project, whereas the appraisal estimate was based on PLN conventional
construction.
*  As RE I was the first large rural electrification project undertaken by PLN, the SAR estimates
of unit costs were not able to take into account economies of scale effects brought about by the
large volumes of materials ordered and under an ICB tendering process.
*  Physical quantity estimates in the SAR were based on limited information, since at the time of
project preparation PLN's experience with rural electrification was limited and reliable data
for estimating material requirements for electrifying villages were not available. In the two
year period between the preparation of SAR estimates and issuance of tender documents for
distribution network materials under this project, PLN was able to collect more up to date data
and accounts information which enabled it to sharpen the estimates of materials required.
*  intemational inflation was lower than projected in estimates of the price contingencies

7.     During mid-year 1992, PLN requested and the Bank approved utilization of a portion of the cost
savings (para 6) to finance the electrification of an additional 1,500 villages that represented a portion of
the Repelita V target for years 1992/93 and 1993/94.
8.    Implementation Schedule. The SAR estimate of time from loan signing to physical completion
was about 48 months. This implementation period had to be extended by 12 months, from June 30, 1994
to June 30, 1995, the primary reasons being: (i) expansion of project scope, from 4,500 villages to 6,000;
and (ii) delays in selecting consultants, and (iii) protracted and inefficient procurement procedures for
equipment and materials.
9.     Cancellation. The appraisal cost estimate for the original project scope, including contingencies,
was US$329 million (US$325 million being PLN's share, and US$4 million being MOCSE's allocation).
The total disbursed, taking into account the expanded project scope and implementation period discussed
above, was about US$261.3 million (US$257.7 million for PLN, and US$3.6 million for MOCSE). About
US$55.4 million was formally canceled in September 1994 upon request of the Government and PLN, and
the undisbursed balance of about US$12.3 million, as of November 28, 1995 was canceled at that time.
On the grant side, the undisbursed balance of about Yen 33.1 million was canceled at the time of closing
the grant on November 13, 1995.
Objective-specific results
10.    To construct facilities to electrify about 4,500 new villages during 1990/91 and 1991/92, a
project objective that was expanded in 1992, because of cost savings (para 6), whereby the Bank agreed to
provide partial financing for PLN's rural electrification investment program for four years, 1990/91
through 1993/94. Under the expanded scope, Bank financing was provided to connect 6,000 villages in
total, out of the Repelita target of 9,280 villages over the same period (1990/91-1993/94). This target was
exceeded bv about 20 percent.
11.    To improve the planning of rural electrification subsector development through strengthening
of the planning capability of sectoral organizations: This institutional development objective was
substantially achieved in PLN. A Rural Electrification Master Plan was developed and a customer
information system was installed to help in planning and monitoring rural electrification activities as well
as assisting in economically justifiable village selection and prioritization. Further implementation of
recommendations under the Master Plan is required to operationalize and mainstream the use of these
systems, especially in the regions.
12.   The sub-objective of pilot testing a financial reporting system for segregating PLN's accounts --
the preparation of financial information specific to PLN's rural electrification operation -- was only
partially achieved.  The rural electrification cost tracking system database software developed by
consultants was to be pilot tested in Wilayah XI. However, formal testing was only begun after loan
closing. Contributing factors that limited success include: (i) inadequate emphasis and priority accorded to
the execution of this task as well as inadequate supervision of the consultant efforts; (ii) a late finish by the
consultants which left no time for pilot testing; (iii) the lack of computerized accounting system in the pilot
test region; and (iv) failure to actively involve PLN's accounting and financial staff in the design and
testing phase.
13.    To reduce the unit cost of electricity distribution in rural areas through the revision and
adoption of appropriate technical design and construction standards and improved procurement and



7
construction procedures: This objective was substantially achieved. Adopting new technical designs and
construction standards has been a learning process for PLN with evident success. For example, lighter
poles and smaller conductor sizes from those conventionally used by PLN were adopted. Whereas PLN
had previously used 11 meters poles for MV construction, for this project, 75 % of the poles were 9 m
only. Similarly for LV construction, 75 % of the poles were 7 m instead of the conventional 9 m. For MV,
35 nun and 70 mm2 AAAC conductor was used instead of the conventional 150 mm2 and 210 mm2, and
for LV, 35 mm2 conductor was erected instead of the previous mix of 35 mm2 and 70 mm.2
14.    To maximize the economic benefits of rural electrification by increasing in-village connections
and by increasing productive use of electricity by small businesses: Increases in in-village connections
and productive use of electricity by small businesses through a pilot effort were substantially achieved.
The number of households electrified over the four year period 1990/91-1993/94, financed in part by the
project, far exceeded the pro-rated Repelita target. Specifically, about 3.5 million households were
connected over this period, in comparison to a target of about 2 million households.
15.   A pilot program component under the project, designed to test ways to enhance the economic
benefits of RE by increasing the productive uses of electricity by small businesses, yielded very
encouraging results. In this pilot effort, PLN contracted NGOs in five areas to inform rural small
businesses about the price, convenience and competitiveness of PLN electricity and about technological
options in their business. As a result, over the project period nearly 9,000 small rural businesses have
developed productive uses for electricity, which led to an increase in their employment levels from an
average of 2.02 full-time and 0.93 part-time employees per enterprise, to 2.6 and 1.4 respectively,
following the development of productive uses utilizing electricity. Capital for making the change over to
electricity using equipment, was raised entirely from private sources.
16.    To reduce costs through enhancement of the role of village cooperatives/organizations
implementing and operating the rural power systems: This objective was substantially achieved. Prior
to project implementation, the Pola I and Pola II program achievements were lagging behind REPELITA
IV targets. At the project closing date, an estimated 2,260 KUDs were operating 1,800 Pola I and 460
Pola I & II schemes covering 11,000 villages of which 60% are situated Outside Java. Furthermore,
approximately 90 MSA-gnrd and 20 MSA-diesel agreements were in operation, slightlv above of the target
set in the REPELITA V.
17.   The Pola program experience confirms that labor intensive distribution service activities can be
effectively managed by KUDs and mitigate the need for PLN to expand its staff and organizational
resources. PLN regional managers and staff generally view the Pola Program in a very positive light
though they were unable to provide quantitative estimates of the cost savings because of limitations in the
present cost accounting systems. Direct benefits also accrue to the VEOs such as, increased fee income
and membership fees, while at the same time increasing local community employment and participation.
18.    To strengthen PLN's and MOCSE's organizational units responsible for rural electrification:
Overall this institutional development objective was substantially achieved with respect to PLN. In the
case of PLN, this capacity building largely centered around the development of the Rural Electrification
Master Plan and related training of staff for its Rural Electrification Division (DIVDES), by consultants.
19.    MOCSE's regional offices demonstrated their capacity to coordinate and promote Pola I and II
schemes. However, with regard to promotion of grid-MSA schemes which are key to achieving major cost
reduction through local participation by VEOs the record could have been better. Major constraints to
expanding the Pola/MSA Programs are the weak skills base of KUD personnel, a fee structure that in many



8
instances is inadequate to attract qualified personnel and inadequate effort and facilitation by MOCSE staff
from headquarters, from provincial (KANWIL) and district (KANDEP) levels.
C. Major Factors Affecting the Project
C.1 Factors not generally subject to government control
20.    Consultant performance:  Consultant performance partially affected achievement of project
institutional development goals. Specifically, completion of the Rural Electrification Master Plan was
delayed approximately one year due to a combination of the following: (a) delays in hiring of consultants;
and (b) the consultant being unable to deliver the final product on time. With respect to the MOCSE, the
institutional development study focused on conversion of rural electric cooperatives to electric utilities,
rather than providing specific guidelines for structuring implementable strategies to improve MOCSE's
capability to support the existing sectoral and institutional framework for rural electrification expansion.
21.    Change in international inflation rates: International inflation rates leveled off toward the end of
the 1980's and therefore, the price contingencies calculated for the project were overestimated, leading
partially to overestimation of project costs and cancellation of loan funds.
C.2 Factors generally subject to government control
22.    Government policy imposed cumbersome and lengthy procurement procedures: Substantial
delays in project implementation, partly due to compliance with lengthy Government procurement
procedures, were a significant factor contributing to the one year project extension.
23.    Allocation of GOI budget to PLN's rural electrification program: Thus far, the GOI's sector
policy has not inhibited PLN's ability to achieve the project's objectives; however if not corrected, some
aspects of the government's policy and practice will undermine the long term sustainability of the rural
electrification program. Specifically, the GOI's process for allocating budget funds is based on a target
number of villages connected. The budget allocation and oversight process continues to be driven by
village (not household) electrification targets, and provide very weak incentives for PLN to expand beyond
the target number of villages by aggressively seeking and implement efficiency improvement and cost
saving measures.
24.    Electricity pricing policy: The Government has a controlling say in the setting of retail electricity
tariff, levels and structure. A key feature of this policy has been the subsidization of small residential &
commercial users, that represent the overwhehTing number of rural connections. This policy of the
Government is intended to increase the benefits of electricity to rural communities by making it more
widely affordable. However, its practical effect is to largely undermine the Government's objective.
Despite the subsidies, the rural household electrification remain low at under 30 percent. The high lump
sum payment required for the initial connection as well as the fixed monthly demand charge serve as
barriers to increasing household connections. There is clear evidence that the household electrification ratio
in rural areas can be increased significantly and quickly, by rolling these fixed charges into the energy
Other constraints are due to: (i) PLN's administrative procedures and management that occasionally causing excessive
delay in identifying, preparing the groundwork and implementing Pola schemes; and (ii) limitations in PLN's training
capacity to train the necessary number of KUDs personnel for the very activities they will subsequently takeover.

charges. A second adverse impact of the Government tariff policy stems from the fact that the energy
charge has been set below the variable cost of supply, a problem that is particularly acute in the smaller
regional grids and isolated diesel operations outside Java. This policy leads to financial operating losses
on PLN for any additional rural households connected, and therefore creates a strong dis-incentive for PLN
to connect more rural households
C.3 Factors generally subject to implementing agency control
25.    Technical assistance supervision: The Institutional Development Study of MOCSE's Directorate
General of Cooperatives Business Promotion did not provide specific practical recommendation on how to
improve MOCSE's institutional capabilities to support the national rural electrification program. Instead,
the study's recommendations called for a switch to a totally new sector organizational model for RE
delivery; a model that was at substantial variance with the prevailing policy consensus across a broad
spectrum of Government agencies -- DGEED, BAPPENAS, PLN, MOF --and that was also reflected in the
Bank's Rural Electrification sector report.
26.    Substantial delays in completion of the Rural Electrification Master Plan are attributable to a
combination of factors, including the delay contractor selection by PLN which resulted in a late start, and
consultants' inability to deliver all the final product on time. Testing a system for a separate rural
electrification financial reporting system was a key pilot component in the Rural Electrification Master
Plan, which was not delivered fully.
27.    Construction supervision and monitoring: Construction supervision was undertaken by PLN's
Wilayah or Distribusi Staff with no formal mechanism for centralizing progress or performance reporting.
These deficiencies have been recognized by PLN, which has now institutionalized a Project Management
Unit (PMU) with responsibility for tracking and monitoring progress and recommending corrective steps as
necessary.
C.4 Implementation delays also subject to implementing agency control
28.    Procurement of goods and consulting services: Procurement practices and consultant selection
procedures substantially delayed procurement of goods and hiring consultants. The overall slippage in
procurement was 12 months and this was a key contributing factor in the one year project extension. There
were lengthy delays between bid closing date and bid evaluation, delays between receipt of Bank NOL and
preparation of final contract document, and in posting of the performance bonds by contractors.
D. Project Sustainability
29.    The achievements brought about by the project are highly likely to be sustainable.   These
achivements have to be seen in the context of a gradual and continuous learning process leading toward the
goal of creating an efficient and sustainable rural electrification program. For example, changes in
equipment standards and performance specifications and in network design, facilitated by the project,
provide the basis for realizing significant cost reductions in the equipment and material costs of the
physical program in the next stage of rural electrification which is now being carried out under the Bank
financed Second Rural Electrification Project (RE II), that became effective in July 1995. Furthermore, as
a direct consequence of the capacity building component of the project, the resulting advanced knowledge
coupled with PLN's evolved state of readiness sets the stage for testing pilot distribution projects in the RE



10
II project that would form the basis for further cost reductions in the following stage of rural electrification.
Also, the positive experience gained with local participation -- in the form of Pola schemes -- and the
productive use pilot promotion, has provided the basis for seeking more ambitious and large scale
promotion of these concepts in the Second Rural Electrification Project.
30.    Operational Plans to ensure the sustainability of results achieved under the project have been
discussed and agreed with PLN's management and with MOCSE, during the ICR mission. These plans
are presented in Appendix B.
E. Bank Performance
31.    Overall, the Bank's performance has been highly satisfactory.  In particular, the Bank has
successfully maintained good working relations with PLN and MOCSE, identified and appraised the
project, assisted PLN and MOCSE in project preparation, and supervised the project over a five year
period. Project preparation included all necessary conditions to ensure sustainability of results as well as
enhance the counterpart's rural electrification management, planning and implementing capacity. A total of
seven supervision missions were fielded during the project implementation period. Problems encountered
were clearly identified; solutions, agreed actions, and advice to problems were promptly provided to those
concerned. Suitable follow-up actions were taken and where needed, mid-course corrections were made.
The project was supervised by three task managers,with no discernable negative impact on project
continuity and outcome.
32.    There were a few weaknesses in the project design as it pertained to monitoring. The project
lacked simple and specific requirements for progress reporting from the Borrower. Although PLN
dedicated a lot of time and resources to preparing and submitting progress reports, most of the information
contained therein was not useful to assess the status of the project. In the absence of a central project
management unit (PMU), no single management unit within PLN was responsible for coordinating and
monitoring the outcome of the project and undertaking timely interventions and corrective actions as
necessary. This also made it difficult for Bank staff to supervise and monitor progress of the project, while
requiring additional time and financial resources to supervise the project.
F. Borrower Performance
33.   The overall assessment of PLN's and MOCSE's performance is satisfactory. All commitments
made during the negotiations and covenanted under the loans were fulfilled. Given the fact that the
project was Indonesia's first rural electrification loan with the World Bank, it did lay the foundation for
PLN to bring its rural electrification operation closer in line with good practice. Despite the favorable
outcomes, there were a few deficiencies on the Borrower's part in the execution of the project
including:
* The project suffered from substantial delays in implementation due to lengthy procurement
times driven by requirement imposed by GOI procurement procedures, as well as cumbersome,
lengthy and inefficient procurement procedures and practices internal to PLN. Both of these
were significant contributing factors to the one year loan closing date extension.



11
*  Supervision efforts by PLN of the key technical assistance (TA) elements of the project,
appear to have been directed more to process related matters and to a lesser degree to the
substance. Considerably more attention and emphasis needed to be paid to learning directly
from the project consultants, especially regarding the Master Plan and related models and
methodologies. There has been a lower than expected "absorption" associated with the skills
transfer and instititutional strengthening objectives of the TA, and the net result is a continued
and high dependency on consultants.
*  Inadequate emphasis and priority were accorded to the task of designing and pilot testing of a
system for segregation of RE accounts, with a view to setting the stage for mainstreaming the
approach within PLN. The resultant lack of progress sets back achievement of a key goal of
the Government; establishing financial accountability for, and transparency in PLN's RE
operations. As a consequence, PLN's efforts to restructure its organization and effectively
separate its commercial operations from its socially mandated operations, as well as the
Government's push to achieve further efficiency gains and measurable cost reductions in RE
delivery, to reduce its contributions to PLN financing, will be significantly hampered.
G. Summary Assessment of Outcome
34.    The results of the project have been satisfactory; it met or exceeded most of the major development
objectives, though its implementation experienced delays in procurement and hiring of consultants in the
early stages, and 'babsorption" by PLN associated with the institutional strengthening objectives of the TA
component, was below expectation. In terms of physical achievement, the project electrified a total of
6,000 villages, one third more than the original target. Furthermore, PLN electrified these villages at lower
costs than originally estimated, and was able to reduce equipment and material costs by employing
"lighter" and more appropriate designs.
H. Future Operations
35.    The Bank's Second Rural Electrification Project (Loan 3845-IND - 'RE II Project'), builds on the
foundation set by the RE I project. The RE II project, which was declared effective in July 1995, has a
physical component comprising the electrification of 7,000 villages and 2.1 million rural customers, over
the years 1995/96-1996/97. Key policy components of the RE II project are:
a) irnplement institutional changes required to enhance the organizational and management
efficiency of undertaking RE within PLN, consistent with the ongoing restructuring of PLN;
b) establish incentives for private sector and local cooperatives to take an increasingly larger
share of RE distribution and alternative energy development within the framework of a least-
cost RE Master Plan, specifically by implementing: (i) a published power purchase tariff based
on PLN's "avoided cost of supply" and standard contract for power purchases by PLN from
small power producers; (ii) a bulk supply tariff for wholesale sales of power by PLN to
potential retail distributors of electricity based on PLN's economic cosst of supply;
c) continue PLN's institutional development to undertake RE planning and implementation,
especially at the regional level;



12
d) substantially increase the base of local participation in rural electrification by expanding the
Pola Program, in terms of numbers, scope of services, and regional coverage;
e) expand, with a view to mainstreaming the small rural business services component to promote
productive uses of electricity, including participation by NGOs; and
f) undertake pilot projects to test the adaptability of low cost 'low tech" equipment designs, low
cost network reticulation designs and more efficient construction management methods for full
scale implementation at a subsequent stage, possibly supported by a future Bank loan.
1. Key Lessons Learned
36.    Several specific key lessons, which have operational and strategic implications for the design of
future rural electrification projects, can be drawn from this project. These are discussed in the following.
Strategic Lessons
37.    Properly structured local participation can help to significantly lower the cost of rural
electrification: PLN's experience of contracting out a range of mainly labor intensive activities in
distribution and retailing to village level organizations on a fee-for-service basis, the 'Pola program"-- has
proven to be beneficial for all parties involved. This positive experience underpins the conclusion that an
effective strategy for increasing the efficiency of RE delivery and its developmental impact is to incorporate
in RE projects, programs that will directly help increase local participation. Under such programs, private
village electricity organizations would assume management responsibility for a range of distribution
functions in a given area, which if successful, could ultimately, entail takeover of an entire service area,
including asset ownership.
38.    PLN must be made financially accountable for its rural electrification program: To facilitate
that PLN achieves rural electrification delivery in an efficient and least cost manner, while at the same time
working to maximize rural electrification benefits and the household connection rate, it is necessary to
establish transparency and financial accountability for the rural electrification program. Further over a
period of time, the Government's financial contributions to PLN should be phased down and ultimately
limited to: (i) cost recovery for efficient expansion of rural electrification coverage; and (ii) coverage of
operating losses, to the extent the Government's mandated retail tariffs to end users do not cover such costs
of efficient and least cost provision. The Government's effort underway to corporatize PLN while also
creating a multi-operater environment with private sector participation on a major scale, is expected to
bring about the conditions under which the need for substantially eliminating tariff distortions will become
unavoidable; conditions under which the Government will also find it politically easier to introduce such
changes.
Operational Lessons
39.    Central Project Management Unit (PMU) benefits overall project coordination  and
accountability. The project did not require PLN, the implementing agency, to establish a central project



13
management and implementation supervision unit. As a result, no senior PLN manager was responsible for
monitoring progress and the outcome of the project, and for initiating corrective actions in a timely manner.
This made it difficult for Bank staff to supervise the project while also adding to the time and financial
resources devoted to the supervision activity.
40.    Technical audits could be a powerful aid in monitoring the efficiency of rural electrification
delivery. Cost reductions in equipment and material costs were realized in the project. However, the
project did not incorporate any means to verify that the resources were used efficiently and maximized the
intended developmental impact on the ground, for example by conducting a technical audit on a sampling
basis. Inter alia, a technical audit would focus ex-post on quality assurance and efficiency as it relates to
program aspects such as hardware utilized, network design implemented, erection, inventory management,
speed of customer connections following village access to electricity, operations and maintenance
procedures and actions to ensure that the equipment performs to standards throughout its intended life.
41.    Cumbersome procurement processes are a leading cause of project implementation delays.
PLN's procurement process results in a lengthy procurement cycle which adds delays and unnecessary
costs to projects5 that it undertakes. Speedier procurement processing and more efficient inventory
management and materials handling are key to increasing the efficiency of the rural electrification
investment program. Adoption of performance based specifications for new equipment, standardized
bidding documents and a just-in-time procurement, inventory and installation policy could significantly
reduce construction and equipment procurement costs.
M:\ICR-REI\PLNICR3.DOC

The problem of extended procurement cycle can be found in the systemic inefficiency endemic not only to the power
sector at large but also country wide.

AIDE MEMOIRE
Indonesia: RE I - Implementation Completion Report
Aide Memoire - World Bank Mission
Jakarta, November 3, 1995
1.     INTRODUCTION
1.1    This Aide Memoire records the findings of a World Bank Power Mission comprising Mr. Arun P.
Sanghvi (Mission Leader), and Messrs. John Tulloch and Tig Tuntivate, who visited Indonesia during
October 15 through November 7, 1995, for preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR)
for the Rural Electrification Project, Loan 31 80-IND ("RE I" Project). The mission records its thanks to
PLN, MOCSE and GOI officials for the assistance provided in ICR preparation and acknowledges the
courtesies and cooperation extended.
2.     ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN
2.1    The mission: (i) collected the data necessary to prepare the Statistical Tables in the ICR, and (ii)
reviewed other background data considered essential to developing the mission's analysis. Extensive
discussions were held with PLN and MOCSE staff and management to better understand and interpret the
available data, before arriving at the assessment of the RE I Project as regards the degree of achievement of
project objectives, prospects for the project's sustainability, assessment of project outcome as well as
assessment of Bank and Borrower performance, and the lessons leamed. In addition, the mission provided
considerable support to the Borrower for preparing their contribution to the ICR.
3.     ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVES -- OVERVIEW OF FINDINGS
3.1   In summary, the mission's major findings are
*  The RE I project substantially achieved its main objective to support the phased development
and implementation of an efficient and effectve rural electrification program in Indonesia and
strengthening key sector institutions. Key project interventions aimed at increasing efficiency
of RE investment - design and construction -- increasing the benefits of RE, and increasing
resource mobilization from non-governmental sources were largely a success.
*  The number of villages electrified over the four years of REPELITA V (1990/91-1993/94),
and financed in-part by the project, exceeded the target by about 20%; the number of
households electrified over this period exceeded the target by 35%. Specifically, about 2.7
million households were connected to the gnrd over this period, in comparison to a target of
about 2 million households.
*  Savings in equipment and matenal costs incurred for the project, amounted to about 30% as
compared to costs expenenced bv PLN under pre-project practices, i.e., the reahzed costs were



29
ANNEX A
about $45,000 per village electrified as compared to SAR estimates of about $65,000 per
village, which were based on pre-project experience.
*  PLN prepared a Rural Electrification Master Plan together with supporting management
information system and models, to facilitate economically justifiable village selection and
prioritization. The completion of this Master Plan represents a significant milestone and a
major step in helping rationalize RE planning and in identifying a least cost strategy for
electrifying the approximately 30,000 remaining un-electrified villages in rural Indonesia,
including the determination of village electrification targets by region.
*  A pilot program component under the project, designed to test ways to maximize the economic
benefits of RE by increasing the productive uses of clectricity by small businesses, yielded very
encouraging results. In this pilot effort, PLN contracted NGOs in five areas to inform rural
small businesses about the price, convenience and competitiveness of PLN electricity and about
technological options in their business. As a result, nearly 9,000 small rural businesses have
developed productive uses for electricity, which has led to an increase in their employment
levels from an average of 2.02 full-time and 0.93 part-time employees per enterprise, to 2.6 and
1.4 respectively, following the development of productive uses utilizing electricity. Capital for
making the change over possible to electricity using equipment, was raised entirely from private
sources.
-  The "Pola program" experience under the project-- wherein PLN sub-contracted out a range of
mainly labor intensive activities im distribution and retailing to village level organizations on a
fee-for-service basis-- has proven to be beneficial for all parties involved. As of the closing date
of the project, an estimated 2300 village level organizations - cooperatives - compared with
about 817 organizations at the time of appraisal, were contracted by PLN to operate nearly
2,500 different schemes covering 11,000 villages. This experience confirms that many labor
intensive distribution service activities can be effectively undertaken by properly trained local
organizations with resultant cost savings for PLN, while also benefiting local organizations
through the provision of fee income, technical training as well as local community employment
participation.
*  Changes in equipment and performance standards and in network design developed during the
course of the RE I project, have provided the basis for achieving significant cost reductions in
equipment and material costs of the physical program in the next stage of the RE program
under the Bank's ongoing lending operation, the Second Rural Electrification Project ("RE II",
Loan 3845-lND).
*  Collection of data necessary for computing the ex-post EIRR was still ongoing at the time of
preparation of this aide memoire. PLN assured the mission that the remaining data will be
made available to the mission, pnror to its departure from Indonesia. Based on the preliminary
data available at this stage, it is estimated that the project ex-post EIRR is expected to exceed
the appraisal estimate.
3.2    Measured against most yardsticks, the "scorecard" for project performance vis-a-vis its objectives
is favorable. However, there were three significant deficiencies in project execution on the Borrower's part:



30
ANNEX A
*  The project suffered from substantial delays in implementation due to lengthy procurement
times driven by the requirements imposed by GOI procurement procedures, as well as
cumbersome, lengthy and inefficient procurement procedures and practices internal to PLN.
Both these were significant contributing factors to the one year loan closing date extension;
*  Supervision efforts on part of PLN related to the key technical assistance (TA) elements of the
project, appear to have been directed more to process related matters and to a lesser degree to
the substance. Considerably more attention and emphasis needed to be paid to learning directly
from the project consultants, especially regarding the Master Plan and related models and
methodologies. There has been a lower than expected "absorption" associated with the skills
transfer and institutional strengthening objectives of the TA, and the net result is a continued
and high dependency on consultants.
*  Inadequate emphasis and priority were accorded to the task of designing and pilot testing of an
automated system for segregation of RE accounts, with a view to setting the stage for
mainstreanung the approach within PLN. The resultant lack of progress sets back achievement
of a key goal of the Government; establishing financial accountability for, and transparency in
PLN's RE operations. As a consequence, PLN's efforts to restructure its organization and
effectively separate its commercial operations from its socially mandated operations, as well as
the Government's push to achieve further efficiency gains and measurable cost reductions in
RE delivery, to reduce its contributions to PLN financing, will be significantly hampered.
4.     OPERATIONAL PLAN
4.1    A plan was agreed with PLN for the operational phase of the RE I project (1995 to 2010). PLN's
Operational Plan ensures that the materials and equipment installed under the project will function in
accordance with performance expectations and over the useful economic life. The plan calls for the
utilization of established procedures for operations and maintenance that PLN staff must use. These
procedures, which are defined in comprehensive documents, were reviewed by the mission and found to be
in line with good practices worldwide. The operational plan also identifies the qualifications and skill levels
of personnel to be assigned to undertake the required operations and maintenance as well as any special
training requirements. As regards the TA component, the RE Master Plan, the village selection economic
model and the management information system, that were developed under the project, are being
operationalized under the ongoing RE II project. PLN's Operational Plan also outlines the strategy for
increasing productive uses of electricity as a follow on from the lessons leamt in the Small business
Services (SBS) program in the RE I project.
5.     NEXT STEPS
5.1    The mission's draft final ICR report, reflecting the above findings is expected to be sent to GOI,
PLN and MOCSE by no later than November-end. Since the findings noted above as well as the underlying
analysis have been discussed at length with the Borrower and implementing agencies during the course of
the ICR mission, and an advance draft of the draft final ICR report was also provided and discussed. It was
agreed that the Borrowver and implementing agencies concerned would forward remaining comments if any,
to the Bank, as well as anv comments on the draft final ICR report by no later than December 10, 1995.

OPERATIONAL PLAN
RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT (LOAN 3180-IND)
A. P.T. PLN (PERSERO): OPERATIONAL PLAN
I Physical -- Distribution Network and Isolated Diesel Generation
1.    Background. Through the RE I Program, PLN has made substantial investment in distribution
networks and isolated diesel generation sets. This plan sets the basis upon which PLN will ensure it
maximizes the return on investment over the economic life time of the materials and equipment installed
2.     Maintenance Program
2.1   Isolated Diesel Generation Sets. PLN has established comprehensively documented maintenance
procedures for isolated diesel generation sets. These procedures entitled guidance and instruction of
maintenance of diesel power plant and dated March 17, 1995 have been distributed to all regions where
isolated diesel generation sets have been installed. The procedures detail the type and frequency of
maintenance to be provided and have an established reporting system to monitor adherence to procedures.
The reports are submitted to Operation Division in the Head Office quarterly. maintenance is carried out in
accordance with manufacturers specifications a copy of which is held for each set.
2.2    Distribution Network. Maintenance on the distribution network in rural areas is managed by the
regional office (Wilayah). Regular patrols of lines takes place and any deficiencies are noted and
corrected. In addition, a faults service is provided to provide rapid response to faults as they occur. The
maintenance and faults are conducted in accordance with procedures entitled Quality, Reliability and
Efficiency Indicator of Electric Supply (Circular letter No. 006/PST/88) dated 31, March 1988. These
provide for regular reporting and monitoring with reports being presented quarterly to Customer Services
Division.
3.     Operation Procedures
3.1   Isolated Diesel Generation Sets. Currently, PLN is prepanrng detail operation procedures for
isolated diesel generation sets. These are expected to be completed and made available to the region by
1996. In the meantime, operational personnel are provided with manufacturers handbook manuals and
required to operate the set, strictly in accordance with these.
3.2    Distribution Network.   Personnel operating the distribution network are provided with
manufacturers handbook manuals as appropriate i.e., for switch gear and operational equipment. They are
required to operate the equipment strictly in conformity with the manual.
4.     Qualification of Personnel
4.1   Isolated Diesel Generation Sets. All personnel maintaining or operating isolated diesel generation
sets are required to be trained to have the following qualifications: (a) Diesel Operator II; (b) Diesel



32                                     ANNEX B
Technician II; (c) Diesel Electrician II; (d) Diesel Operator I; (e) Diesel Technician I; (f) Diesel Electrician
I. Training is provided at PLN Training Center.
4.2    Distribution Network. All personnel under taking operational or other works on distribution
network lines are required to be trained and qualified as follow: (a) Hot Line Maintenance; (b) Jointing
Supervision; (c) LV and MV Stringing; (d) Switching (LBS, CBS) Operation.
5.     Master Plan for Future Development
As part of the project a RE Master Plan was developed to enable PLN to select and prioritize
villages for electrification. To date, data bases have been established in all of the region and hardware have
been installed in four of the regions. It is PLN's plan to extend this to cover all regions and to fully train
sufficient staff in the regions to enable its full usage throughout Indonesia on future rural electrification
projects.
II. Increase Productive Uses of Electricity
1.     Objective. PLN's Operational Plan to increase revenue from its rural electrification program
concentrates on increase productive uses of electricity among potential and existing business enterprise
customers. The Plan is based on experience gained from Small Business Services pilot program under the
RE I. The Plan and implementation activities are in 25 areas covering all of PLN's 14 regions, to be
carried out under the RE II project. PLN's ultimate goal is to increase up to 100% its share of productive
uses kWh energy market of the rural industries in the targeted sub-sectors.
2.     Focus/Targeted Approach. In general, the opcration Plan focuses on attracting the initial group
of small businesses in the targeted area to change over from manual or diesel energy to PLN services
through short, intensive information and advisory campaigns. Second, the enterprise selection criteria
emphasizes enterprises in industrial sector with potential for high increase in kWh sales rather than all
small business. Third, implementation will have an increased involvement of PLN's branch and sub-
branch staff, more effective screening, improved monitor and reporting, standardized promotional
materials, and a central NGO training capability for NGO and PLN field staff. The approach is designed
to maximize potential benefits of the promotion activities, while at the same time minimizing the unit costs
of the activities.
3.     Strategies. Specifically, the Plan employs the following strategies:
* First, as the key of marketing strategy the Plan addresses infor-mation constraints to productive uses by
utilizing local NGOs to actively advise customers and potential customers on price and technical
aspects of PLN services and technology options for electric motors. The Plan will utilize NGOs to
organize intensive promotional campaigns carried out for approximately 10 months in each area to
attain the most cost effective results.
* Second, reduce tariff administration barriers to increased productive uses by: (a) providing clear and
possibly revised guidance to field staff on the criteria to be applied in classifying small industry under
the Il or 12 tariff code; (b) correctly classifying new small industry customers under the II or 12 tariff
code; and (c)reclassifying as I1 or 12 small industries presently assigned an RI/R2 tariff code.



33                                  ANNEX B
*  Third, strengthen PLN corporate capabilities to provide services to rural business by for example: (a)
training PLN staff responsible for business promotion ensuring that logistical, supplies, administrative
and other support are adequate; and (b) issuing operational directives setting out PLN's policies and
promotion efforts for rural businesses.
*  Fourth, the implementation of productive uses promotion will be monitored and the outcome will be
evaluated on a regular basis.
*  Fifth, the Plan recognizes that the quality of PLN's electricity services to rural business is key to the
success and sustainability of the program. Good quality of service also ensures: (a) loyalty and
increased sales among and business customers, and (b) increase in business customer connections.
Therefore, the Rural Electrification Office and the designated offices in every Region will also monitor
the quality of services.
B. MINISTRY OF COOPERATIVES AND SMALL ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT
(MOCSE): OPERATIONAL PLAN
4.1    Pola I, II and MSA arrangements are being expanded in the RE II project. Also a key features of
the RE II project is to prepare for the development of Pola III services under which the cooperative
purchases electricity in bulk from PLN and takes over all distribution function as well as ownership of all
related assets.
4.2    The next operational phase of the Pola program calls for a near doubling of the total number of
Pola I, II and MSA programs (5,700 by the end of FY 1997/98), with a 2.5 fold increase in the MSA-grid
contract to about 600 by the end of FY 1997/98. Success in expanding the Pola program will depend on
MOCSE and PLN's ability to work together to address the major constraints to expand efficiently and
rapidly.
4.3    Further, the operational plan will entail: (i) strengthening of the skill base of KUD personnel,
through a nation-wide Pola I, II and MSA training Program; (ii) reduction in the excessive delays in
implementing PolaJMSA programs caused by administrative procedures at PLN, by incorporating better
trouble shooting capability in the program management structure; (iii) enhancement of MOCSE's ability to
support KUD, by providing program promotion, orientation and management training at the Pusat, Kanwil
and Kandep levels.
4.4    Provision has also been made in MOCSE's Operational Plan to study the feasibility of preparing
two areas with a substantial number of KUD's involved in Pola I, 11 and MSA activities to form Pola III.
The two candidate areas are South Sulawesi and East Java.

ANNEX C
BORROWERS' CONTRIBUTIONS
A.    P.T. PLN (PERSERO)
1.    EVALUATION OF THE BANK'S PERFORMANCE
1.1    Bank's performance during the evolution and implementation of the project was generally
satisfactory. The efforts were very constructive in every salient matters during the process of project
implementation. Bank's involvement was diligently maintained through the whole phases. In negotiation
phase, Bank had sent qualified and competent mission so the scrutinizing process in establishing the project
objective, and also in assessing of the projcct cost, scope of work, financing plan and time schedule of the
project could be accomplished successfully in relatively short time. In Appraisal phase, Bank fully
involved in establishing Staff Appraisal Report (SAR) particularly in the assessment of cost planning,
scope of work, source of finance, time schedule, and delivered constructive suggestions during cost revision
and scope of 'work negotiations. During construction phase, Bank persistently assisted PLN in supervision
of procurement, project time schedule, cost, disbursement and PLN got some advises in solving the pending
items prior to the date when the loan was nearly closed. Bank extended the period of the loan which
reflected the mutual understanding between the Bank and the Borrower (PLN).
1.2    Based on the experience, PLN has acknowledged that 3 (three) major points need to be pondered:
(i) processes for procurement need to be improved in order to avoid delays; (ii) determine suitable least cost
solutions for materials and construction; and (iii) implement better project monitoring through a Project
Management Unit. The Bank assisted PLN mi these areas.
2.   EVALUATION OF THE BORROWER'S OWN PERFORMANCE
2.1    During project implementation, PLN has made endeavor to improve the process. However, delays
occurred due to procurement processes.
2.2    Delays in procurement processes were because of the following:
(a) For concrete poles, initially only one bid was received. This was deemed non competitive and
a re-bid was called. The rebid prices were higher than PLN ceiling and so protracted
negotiations were necessary.
(b) The highest ranked bidder for insulators was from China. Type tests were from a national
institution which was not intemationally recognized. As a result considerable time was spent
ascertaining their suitability for PLN purposes.
2.3    Separation of rural electrification accounts proposed to get profit/loss statement of rural
electrification was based on PLN Circular Letter No. 13, 1987. It is an principle to extract from general
PLN Wilayah account statement, the share of rural electrification component. To improved this separation
of rural electrification accounts, it was included in Rural Electrification Master Plan. Its application is
only at selected pilot location, PLN Wilayah XI. It is not for the whole PLN yet.
2.4    During the preparation of Rural Electrification Master Plan, to facilitate knowledge transfer from
the consultant, PLN DIVDES arranged for the following:



35
ANNEX C
*  Asked the Consultant to present its work progress to PLN, and discuss it together in meetings.
These meetings took place at least once a month.
*  Consultant provided adequate training to PLN  staffs from  Head Office and four
Regions as well. The training subjects included 4 topics: (a) Topic 1: Computer
Systems, (b) Topic 2:  Data Management &  Processing, (c) Topic 3:  Systems
Planning, (d) Topic 4: Project Analysis & M.I.S. This training was implemented in:
1. Denpasar, for PLN Region VIII, XI and Distribution East Java. (November 28, 1994 -
January 28, 1995 No. of trainee: (28); 2. PLN Head Office in Jakarta, for PLN Region IV and
Head Office as well, and additional training for PLN Region VIII, XI & Distribution East
Java. (March 13, 1995 - April 28, 1995 No. of trainec : 54)
*  On site training for the computer operators in respective Regions during, installation of
hardware, software and data, for around 2 weeks in each Region and PLN Head Office.
*  And to leam more from the Consultant and intensive preparation to hand over the Consultant
product, the staffs, two power engineers and one computer engineer, studied in Consultant
office for about one year.
2.5    Although the project was the first rural electrification loan with the World Bank, PLN's
performance was satisfactory. All comnmitments made during negotiations and covenanted under the loan
were fulfilled. PLN expects that the second rural electrification loan will reinforce the foundation started
by this project. However, PLN recognizes that there is room for improving its perfornance in order to
meet the target dates regarding the overall project schedule.
3.   THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BANK AND THE
BORROWER DURING THE EVALUATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
PROJECT
3.1    The relationship between the Bank and PLN was generally good.  Most of the problems
encountered were clearly identified by both parties and advice to problems were promptly agreed and
provided to those concern.
3.2   In particular, good mutual understanding was achieved in selecting least cost materials and
processes, developing monitoring and tracking processes and overcoming procedural problems likely to
cause potential delays.
4.   THE PERFORMANCE OF CO-FINANCIERS AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BORROWER AND COFINANCIERS DURING THE
EVALUATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROJECT.
4.1    There were no direct dealings between the Co-financier for this project and the borrower.

ANNEX C
5.   ASSESSMENT OF THE OUTCOME
5.1    The main objectives of the project are not only electrify villages and connect rural household but
also to build PLN capacity to efficiently carry out rural electrification program.
5.2    With regards to the physical objective, PLN was able to electrify more villages than target. On the
capacity building side, PLN's staff gained significant experience from the project. PLN's capacity to carry
out rural electrification program efficiently has improved.
5.3    PLN is a very large organization responsible for Generation, Transmission and Distribution for
both urban and rural area throughout the country. In the past PLN emphasized Generation, Transmission
and urban Distribution. However the project help PLN develop the know-how to carry out rural
electrification in most efficient manner and PLN is now in a good position to proceed with future rural
electrification projects in the full knowledge that they will be undertaken economically and in accordance
with a program which best meets PLN and Indonesia objectives.
5.4   In this respect, PLN will be using Rural Electrification Master Plan to aid in REPS to help in least
cost system design, select and prioritize villages. Since PLN for the time being using REPS with sufficient
data to immediately carryout all Regions. But only 4 Regions have Rural Electrification Master Plan
computer facility already.
6.     KEY LESSONS LEARNED
6.1    To maintaining PLN financial health, it's important for PLN to minimizing construction and
service cost and at the same time maximizing revenue.
6.2    Other main lessons leamed were the need to improve procurement procedures and develop systems
criteria to prioritize for village electrification selection. Through the project, PLN has developed systems
through the PMU, PMIP manual and MONMAN to monitor and track progress on large projects in
isolated locations throughout Indonesia.

B. MINISTRY OF COOPERATIVES AND SMALL ENTERPRISES DEVELOPMENT
(MOCSE)
1.     Borrower's Performance
1.1    The performance of MOCSE on project implementation is satisfactory. This could be described
by:
a. Implementation of training for KU]D staff as well as field staff of MOCSE was satisfactory.
b. Implementation of procurement of equipment for KUD aiming at improving administration
management and increasing services to rural electrification customers was satisfactory.
c. Procurement of consulting services for Pola I and II and MSA was satisfactory.
d. Cooperation between PLN and KUD in handling rural electrification was improved.
2.     Borrower's Assessment of Outcome
2.1    The outcome of MOCSE's component of project is satisfactory. Project achieved most of its
major objectives and has achieved satisfactory development results. Only a few shortcomings which can be
notified as the following points.
a. Delay in procuring consultant for institutional development and equipment for KUD's
b. Training on Pola I, Pola II and MSA did not cover all the existing KUD's which are already
managing Pola I, Pola II and MSA.
c. Equipment procurement (such as computers for 400 KUD's and electrician tools for 100
KUD's) was insufficient to cover all KUD's which are managing the Pola I, II and MSA.

RURAL ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
INTERNAL ECONOMIC RATE OF RETURN (IERR)
Benefits
1.         Residential Consumers. The methodology used to estimate economic benefits
for residential consumers can be explained with the help of Figure 1, which shows a demand
function for a household defined by two points. One end of the function is anchored by the
price-quantity pair (Q ,P1), where Q, denotes household consumption of electricity at PLN's
average price, PI, to this consumer class. To anchor the "upper end" of the demand function,
which represents consumer willingness to pay for higher valued uses of electricity, the price-
quantity pair (Qo,Po) is estimated assuming that kerosene would be used for lighting absent
availability of electricity. Household survey data on kerosene consumption and expenditure
for lighting and other data were utilized to establish the monthly kWh consumption (Qo) that
would yield an equivalent amount of lighting intensity (lumens) prior to the availability of
electricity; as well as to convert the unit financial price of kerosene to an equivalent financial
cost per kWh of lighting (Pk). Thus, prior to electrification, Qo units of kerosene (in kWh
equivalence) are consumed at a financial price of Pk. Following electrification, Qi units of
electricity are consumed at a price of PI.
2.         The net economic benefit associated with released resources is estimated as
(Pke,Ple)QO, where Pke represents the economic price of kerosene per kWh of equivalent
lighting, Ple is the economic cost of electricity supply, and Qo is defined above.
3.         The incremental consumer surplus on the diverted market is represented by the
shaded area in Figure 1. A linear demand function is postulated between the points (Ql, PI)
and (Qo, Pk) for the purpose of estimating the consumer surplus. This specification tends to
underestimate the willingness to pay since it does not account for the additional value of the
higher quality of light obtained from electricity.
4.          Using the method outlined in the preceding paragraphs, the average willingness
to pay for residential consumers is estimated to be 19 UScents/kWh. These estimates assume
average monthly consumption of 45 kWh per residential consumer in Java-Bali, and 40 kWh
per residential consumer Outside Java.



39
ANNEX D. 1
Page 2
5.         Non-residential consumers. For non-residential consumers, the basis used for
establishing willingness to pay is the cost of self generation; which has been estimated to be
about 16 c/kWh. Non-residential consumption is assumed to be 125 kWh per month.
Costs
6.          Supply cost. Energy supply cost are calculated on the basis of the economic
cost of bulk power incoming into the 20 kV network; and have been estimated on the basis of
PLN's LRMC study for Java and Outside-Java. For the Java-Bali system, the LRMC for
power delivered to the 20 kV network (excluding losses and investment in the MV network),
is estimated at 9.20 UScents/kWh for residential consumers, and 8.40 c/kWh for non-
residential consumers. Corresponding estimates for the LRMC of slipply in the Outer-
Islands are, 10.40 c/kWh for residential consumers, and 9.70 c/kWh for non-residential
consumers. LRMCs for supply from mini-grids with diesel generation only are estimated to
be 12.60 c/kWh for residential consumers, and 11.7 c/kWh for non-residential consumers.
7.         These estimates of LRMC are not system average costs. Rather, they are
derived from the underlying regional marginal cost structure of PLN --as defined by marginal
capacity cost, marginal energy cost on-peak, and marginal energy cost off-peak at 20 kV --
and by further applying the following load characteristics of the residential and non-
residential rural customers, developed from available PLN load research data. For rural
households, the class average monthly load factor is assumed to be 0.35, and the peak energy
share is 0.53 in Java-Bali and 0.45 outside Java. For non-residential customers, the class
average monthly load factor is assumed to be 0.40, and the peak energy share is assumed to
be at 0.35, in Java and Outside Java.
