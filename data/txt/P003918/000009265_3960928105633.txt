MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR
A RURAT ELECTRIFICATION PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to the
Republic of Indonesia for US$329.0 million is submitted for approval. The
proposed Bank loan would be for 20 years, including five years of grace, at
the Bank's standard variable interest rate and would help finance the Rural
Electrification Project.  The proceeds of the loan, except US$4.0 milli-n to
be made available by GOI to the Ministry of Cooperatives (MOC) for the imple-
mentation of the M-OC component of the project, would be onlent by GOI to the
State Electricity Corporation (PLN) for 20 years, including a grace period of
five years. The onlending rate would be equal to the Bank's standard variable
rate plus fees of 2.50Z. The Government of Japan, through its Japan Grant
Facility, has agreed to provide US$1.3 million equivalent to finance certain
technical assistance under the project.
2.       Background.  Power consumption in Indonesia increased rapidly, from
about 50 kWh per capita in 1977 to 200 kWh per capita in 1988, but remains low
compared to neighboring countries. This low level of electricity consumption
is due primarily to the lack of supply facilities and access to the network
for the residential and other sectors. Rural electrification (RE) began to
receive special attention only in the late 1970s, when GOI became concerned
about the uneven distribution of electricity in rural vis-a-vis urban areas
and asked PLN to reduce the gap. By 1989, at the end of the Fourth Five-Year
Development Plan (REPELITA IV, 1984/85-1988/89), about 4.6 million rural con-
sumers (182 of rural households) in some 19,000 villages (302 of all villages)
had received electricity. In the ongoing REPELITA V (1989/90-1993/94), PLN is
committed to electrify some 11,600 new villages, connecting more than 3 mil-
lion new rural consumers, and bringing the electrification ratio of the rural
population to 29Z (against 75Z urban in Java) and the number of villages elec-
trified to about 50Z. This rural electrification ratio would still be below
those already achieved in the Philippines (up to 50Z) and Thailand (above
602). Aside from PLN, MOC promotes, in conjunction with the Ministry of Mines
and Energy (MME), the role of v..llage cooperatives in rural electrification,
especially in undertaking certain selected functions in operating and main-
taining PLN's power systems in their areas. The objective of this effort is
to reduce PLN's cost and provide an opportunity for the development of
village-level managerial, technical and labor resources.
3.       The main issues in the power sector are:  (a) for PLN to improve its
operating efficiency and quality of supply, particularly in the areas of
system losses and service to consumers; (b) to maintain an appropriate struc-
ture and level of electricity tariffs to provide proper signals to consumers
to use electricity efficiently, ensure adequate cost recovery and enable PLN
to self-finance a reasonable share of its investment program; (c) to formulate
and implement a least-cost investment program; and (d) to develop an appro-
priate institutional framework, including private sector participation, to
meet the evolving needs of the sector. Rural electrification faces similar
issues. To increase the viability of rural electrification, attempts should
be made to reduce the unit cost of power distribution and increase cost



- 2 -
recovery through: (a) revision of technical design and construction standards
for rural areas; (b) improvement of procurement and construction procedures;
(c) greater utilization of supply infrastructure by promoting productive uses
of electricity; and (d) expanding the role of village cooperatives/organiza-
tions in the management and development of the subsector.
4.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The overall objective of GOI in the
power sector is to improve the welfare of the population, both rural and
urban, by rapidly expanding access to electricity, thereby supporting and
stimulating economic activities. GOI's strategy includess (a) meeting the
growing energy demand at least cost, in terms of investment and operating
costs; (b) rationalizing energy pricing policies; and (c) improving the
efficiency of the institutions involved in the energy sector. Another objec-
tive has been to use the energy sector as one of the means for reducing the
developmental imbalanco between urban and rural areas, and between Java and
the Outer Islands. This objective is being pursued through uniform country-
wide prices for electricity, and the promotion of rural electrification. The
Bank has supported GOI's strategy through the filiancing of 17 projects since
1969. More recently, the Bank's support has focussed on developing PLN into a
modern and efficient utility by strengthening technical and corporate
planning, improving organization and management, improving operating
efficiency and developing human resources.
5.       The Bank's specific involvement with the RE program began in 1986
with the preparation of the Rural Electrification Review which laid the
groundwork for continuing dialogue on technical, policy and institutional
measures to improve the efficiency of RE investments. On the basis of this
dialogue with the GOI and PLN, the following strategy was developedt (a) the
comprehensive revision of technical design and construction standards for RE
to adapt them to the lower load density prevailing in rural areas; (b) the
reduction of the cost of equipment and materials by, inter alia, (i) improve-
ment of procurement procedures, including such measures as the adoption of
international competitive bidding; and (ii) improvement in the supervision of
local construction contractors; (c) the revision of village selection criteria
to include additional factors that have a direct bearing on economic
viability, for example, the potential for the development of small industries;
(d) the enhancement of the economic benefits of RE by an active marketing
program to connect actual and potential productive users of electricity;
(e) the reduction in operating cost and improvements of the developmental
benefits of RE through the transfer of utility functions from PLN to village
cooperatives/organizations; (f) the improvement of RE planning through the
preparation of an optimized long-range development plan for RE; and (g) the
strengthening of the PLN and MOC units responsible for RE. The proposed
project, which would be the first Bank operation for rural electrification, is
designed to support this strategy.
6.       Project Objectives.  The overall objective of the proposed project
would be to support the development and implementation of an efficient RE
program in Indonesia. Specific project objectives are: (a) to construct
facilities to electrify about 4,500 villages during 1990/91 and 1991/92;
(b) to improve the planning of rural electrification subsector development by
strengthening the planning capability of sectoral organizations; (c) to reduce
the unit cost of electricity distribution in rural areas by revising and
adopting appropriate technical design and construction standards and improved



- 3 -
procurement and construction procedures; (d) to maximize the economic benefits
of RE by increasing in-village connections and by increasing productive uses
of electricity by small businesses; (e) to reduce costs by enhancing the role
of village cooperatives/organizations in implementing and operating the rural
power systems; and (f) to strengthen PLN's and MOC's organizational units
responsible for rural electrification.
7.       Project Description.  The proposed project would comprise two compo-
nents: (I) PLN Compcnent, including: (i) implementation of PLN's RE invest-
ment to electrify about 4,500 villages to connect about 1.3 million new
consumers; (ii) development and implementation of a demonstration program to
increase productive uses of electricity by small businesses in a number of
selected pilot areas; (iii) provision of technical assistance/consulting
services to: (a) upgrade PLN's planning capability for the preparation of an
optimized long-range RE development plan; (b) develop appropriate RE technical
specifications and construction standards and standardized/computerized bid
documents; and (c) develop and implement a database and management information
system (MIS) to monitor countrywide RE activities and operations; and
(iv) training of PLN's managerial and technical staff responsible for RE
operations; and (II) MOC Component, including: (i) development/implementation
of an action program to strengthen the role of village cooperatives/organiza-
tions in rural electrification, by providing an intensive program for training
of the personnel of village cooperatives/organizations to enable them to
OpeJL&te d4ud ULviciLult r>'u powe. 6iLtZHfl/bybLeti il Lhi-eii- areas under s..1table
services contracts; (ii) institutional development of MOC specifically related
to rural electrification, including: (a) consultancy services to carry out an
organization and management study of MOC's Directorate General of Cooperatives
Business Promotion; and (b) training of the relevant staff of this Directorate
responsible for management, planning and monitoring of its activities in rural
electrification; and (iii) acquisition of training equipment and software
packages necessary to support the above subcomponents.
8.       The proposed Bank loan would finance equipment and materials, consul-
ting services and training. The total financing requirement for the project
is US$524.7 million, with a foreign exchange component of US$356.4 million
(67.9Z), including interest during construction. A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B.
A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Indonesia are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map
is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No. 8134-IND dated February 20,
1990, is being distributed separately.
9.       Agreed Actions.  The following agreements were reached during the
negotiations: (a) PLN would review with the Bar': its annual inve;tment for
rural electrification by November 15 of each year commencing November 15,
1990; (b) GOI would review with the Bank PLN's annual investment plan for
rural electrification by January 31 of each year commencing January 31, 1991
prior to its final approval; (c) GOI, through MOC, would implement an action
program for: (i) institutional development (study followed by implementation)
of MOC's Directorate General of Cooperatives Business Promotion in respect of
its rural electrification functions; (ii) staff training; and (iii) develop-
ment and implementation of measures to strengthen the role of village



- 4 -
cooperatives/organizations in RE; (d) PLN would select villages to be elec-
trified based on criteria acceptable to th; Bank; and (e) PLN would implement
an action program for: (i) the development and implementation of the pilot
demonstration program for promoting productive uses; (ii) upgrading its
planning capability for the preparation of an optimized long range RE
Development Plan; (iii) development of appropriate RE technical and construc-
tion standards; (iv) development and implementation of a data base and MIS for
RE operations; and (v) staff training. In addition, the following agreements
needed under the Power Sector Efficiency and Paiton Thermal Power Projects
(Loans 3097-IND and 3098-IND signed July 21, 1989) would also be included
under the proposed projects (a) realization of an annual rate of return of
not less than 8Z on PLN's revalued average net fixed assets in operation in
Java in FY1989/90 and thereafter; (b) achievement of financial breakeven for
PLN's non-Java operations in FY1992/93; (c) annual review of PLN's investment
plan; (d) sagregation of financial and operating information on PLN's RE
activities: (e) implementation of an action ple-t for efficiency improvements;
(f) review of financing plans for PLN's investment program; (g) annual review
of the tariff level and structure; and (h) limitation of debt and audit of
accounts.
10.      Benefits.  The proposed project would provide electricity to about
1.3 million consumers in some 4,500 villages. It would also increase economic
benefits of rural electrification by reducing the unit costs and by promoting
productive uses of electricity. The project would also strengthen the
aectuoLal organizations through technical assistance and staff training. The
internal economic rate of return on the proposed project is 15Z. The proposed
project would have an impact on poverty alleviation, mainly by providing
employment to the labor force in rural areas for erecting the RE distribution
works.
11.      Risks.  No major risks would be expected in the implementation of the
proposed project. There may be some risks of delay in the implementation of
certain project subcomponents (e.g. productive uses, MOC's subcomponents),
which would be minimized through provision of technical assistance and close
project supervision. Possible effects on the environment, mainly from the
erection of power poles and distribution lines, would be minimal.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
