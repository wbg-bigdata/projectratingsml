               Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account
               and deposit into the Special Deposit

Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance
with the provisions of Article V of the General
Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
     (b)  once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
Page  15
allocated to the eligible Categories less the amount of
any outstanding special commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions

equivalent of twice the amount of the Authorized
Allocation. Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account

further withdrawals shall be made only after and to the

such amounts remaining on deposit in the Special Deposit
Account as of the date of such notice will be utilized in
making payments for eligible expenditures.
6.   (a)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any payment out of the Special Deposit Account: (i)
was made for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible
pursuant to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; or (ii) was not
justified by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the
Borrower shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A)
provide such additional evidence as the Bank may request;
or (B) deposit into the Special Deposit Account (or, if
the Bank shall so request, refund to the Bank) an amount
equal to the amount of such payment or the portion
thereof not so eligible or justified. Unless the Bank
shall otherwise agree, no further deposit by the Bank
into the Special Deposit Account shall be made until the
Borrower has provided such evidence or made such deposit
or refund, as the case may be.
     (b)  If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in the Special Deposit
Account will not be required to cover further payments
for eligible expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly
upon notice from the Bank, refund to the Bank such
outstanding amount.
     (c)  The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank,
refund to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on
deposit in the Special Deposit Account.
     (d)  Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs
6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to
the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
