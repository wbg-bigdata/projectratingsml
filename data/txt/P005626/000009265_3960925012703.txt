NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(Fourth Water Supply Project)
LOAN 1445-TUN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report for the Northern Tunisia Water
Supply Project for which a Loan of US$21.0 million was made to the "Societe
Nationale d'Exploitation et de Distribution des Eaux" (SONEDE), the national
water supply authority. The loan was signed in July 1977, became effective in
January 1978 and was closed in December 1984 and about US$376,000 were
cancelled in August 1985.
The Project Completion Report was prepared by the Europe, Middle East
and North Africa Regional Office on the basis of a mission which visited
Tunisia in December 1985, and of a review of the President's Report, the Loan
and Project Agreements, supervision and progress reports, and related
correspondence and internal memos.
In accordance with the revised procedures for project performance audit
reporting, this PCR was read by the Operations Evaluation Department (OED),
but the project was not audited by OED staff.
Following standard procedures, OED sent copies of the draft PCR to
the Government, the Borrower and co-financier for their comments. However,
no coirnel.ts were received.

TUNISIA
NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(Fourth Water Supply Project)
LOAN 1445-TUN
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
Loan 1445-TUN, was approved in June 1977 for an amount of US$21.0
million to help SONEDE meet increasing water supply demands in five northern
governorates including Greater Tunis and assist SONEDE in developing its
management information system.
The Loan became effective some three months later than originally
envisaged due to delay in signing a loan agreement between the Government and
the Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development, co-financer of the Project
(para 3.01).
The project was implemented by SONEDE's own staff assisted by
foreign consultants for the preparation of detailed design and bid documents
and for the supervision of the construction of a dam-reservoir.  Parts of the
works were commissioned mid-1981 to avoid water cuts in Tunis during the
summz.r of 1981.  The project construction was completed mid-1984, two years
behind original schedule (para 3.03).
Total project costs expressed in Dinars were only 13% higher than
original  estimates  despite  increases  in  project  scope  (para  3.02).   The
performance  of  engineering  consultants,  contractors  and  suppliers  was
generally  good   (para  3.06).    Studies  to  develop  SONEDE's  management
info-mation system were satisfactorily completed by SONEDE's own staff, not by
management consultants as expected at appraisal (para 4.03).  The company's
financial performance was not up to the levels targeted, but nevertheless was
considered satisfactory.  Planned tariff increases were sometimes delayed, but
actual revenue was never far from the level which had been projected. Actual
operating   expenses  exceeded   the  appraisal   forecasts,  mainly  due  to
unanticipated salary increases, and investments were substantially larger than
forecast. This did not, however, cause significant detrimental effects on the
company's operations.



tl v )
The major objectives of the project have been met (para 6.01).
The project was the least-cost solution. The internal rate of return is 10.37
(para 6.04), based on the latest tariffs applied in February 1985.
The project confirms the importance of adhering to the now
generally accepted practice to appraise only on 'he basis of detailed
engineering studies.



PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
TUNISIA: NORTHERN TUNISIA WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
(Fourth Water Supply Project)
(Loan 1445-TUN)
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01   In  Tunisia,  responsibility  for  planning,  design,  construction  and
operation of water supply systems in urban areas and large villages is
assigned to an autonomous public entity, the "Soci6te Nationale d'Exploitation
et de Distribution des Eaux" (SONEDE), which is overseen by the Ministry of
Agriculture.   Water supply in small villages is the responsibility both of
"Direction du G6nie Rural" (DRG), a department of the Ministry of Agriculture,
for planning, design and construction, and of the Offices of the Provincial
Authorities (governorates) for cperation and maintenance.
1.02   One of the major constraints to rapid expansion of public piped water
supply in Tunisia is the remote location of fresh water sources from the main
urban centers, requiring the construction of unusually long transmission
pipelines.   This situation is further worsened by the fact that some highly
saline sources can only be used in conjunction with other fresh sources.  The
cost of the transmission pipelines becomes decisive, as the population size is
small, making the per capital investments prohibitive.   In 1968, when SONEDE
was established, about 90 percent of the urban population had access to a
public water supply, of which only half had house connections. The percentage
of population served in rural areas was much lower, about a third of this
population. The Government's objectives at that time were to give priority to
the urban sector where it could get the maximum benefits with its limited
financial resources and to connect a larger segment of the urban population to
the water networks in order to increase water sales and thus available
financing for further expansion of the water systems.
1.03   The Bank provided continuous support and assistance in establishing and
developing SONEDE, as indicated by a series of loans and credits from 1969
through 1979. In January 1969, the Bank made Loan 581 of US$15.0 million for
water supply works  in the regions of Tunis and Sousse.   These works were
jointly financed by the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA)
with a loan of US$5.0 million. A year later, the Association approved Credit
209 of US$10.5 million for water supply works in eig,.t areas of the country.
This project was also jointly financed by SIDA in an amount of US$3.5
million. The Third Water Supply Project (Loan 989 of US$23.0 millionm made in
1974) concentrated on water supply systems in Sfax and in a number of rural
centers. A Fifth (National Water Supply) Project (Loan 1702) was approved in
1979.   It  was  a  sector  loan,  to  finance  distribution  improvements  and
extensions in urban areas where production capacity was adequate, and to
provide service in rural villages not previously served.  The Bank loan was
for US$25 million, and credits for financing connections were provided by
British banks.   All  these projects have been completed and audited by the
Operations Evaluation Department (OED) except for the Fifth Project for which
a project completion report was prepared and is now being audited.
1.04   The  Fourth  Project  (Northern  Tunisia Water  Supply  Project  -  Loan
1445-TUN, US$21.0 million, June 2, 1977) for which this completion report has
been prepared, was aimed at meeting the water supply requirements in the
northern provinces and assisting the Government's house connection target
(para 2.02 (i)).

I1. PROJECT PREPARATION AND APPRAISAL
Or.in, Preparation and APraiS
2.01     Immediately on SONEDE's formation, an allocation of water resources
was made between potable water and other uses, notably irrigation, with SONEDE
receiving  first  priority.   Between  1962  and  1972,  about  402  of  public
investment in agriculture had been devoted to hydraulic works, which nearly
doubled  irrigated  areas.   Towards  the  end  of  the  1960's,  however,  the
increasingly important need for potable water made it clear that a more
rational study of overall water resources was needed if all future needs were
to be met. In 1969, a start was made, with a Bank technical assistance grant
of US$150,000, on a National Water Master Plan, with a detailed study of the
Northern Region; the Plan proposed an optimum utilization of water resources
by a complex system of dams, hydroelectric works, interconnection canals and
drainage channels, in order to improve irrigation, restore agricultural
production, mininize flooding and produce potable water for the major
population centers and for rural areas.   The Master Plan of  the Northern
region led to two Bank loans:
(i)    the Sidi Salem Multi-Purpose Project (Loan 1431) which included,
among other components, the construction of an impounding dam
(Sidi-Salem) to control and regulate the Medjerdah River and of
a 12c km long Canal (Medjerdah - Cap Bon) to convey water for
irrigation and water supply of the areas of Tunis and Cap Bon.
The Bank provided US$42 million, one-quarter of the estimated
foreign exchange cost of the project. Financing also came from
other external sources, including Iran, the Federal Republic of
Germany and China;
(ii)    the Northern Tunisia Water  Supply Project  (Loan 1445) which
included the construction of production facilities drawing raw
water from the Interconnection Canal constructed under the Sidi
Salem Project. The Northern Tunisia Water Supply Project was
appraised in December 1976 on preliminary designs satisfactorily
prepared by two foreign consulting firms, one for the production
facilities,   the  other   for   the  distribution   facilities.
Negotiations were held in April 1977 after accounts receivable
from Municipalities were decreased, at the Bank's request, from
about 16 months to 9 months of water sales. The loan of US$21.0
million was approved on June 2, 1977.
Objectives
2.02     The objectives of the project were to:
(i)    meet the water supply demand in the project area and help SONEDE
to provide at least 81% of the expected 1985 country urban
population with house connections;



(ii)    promote close cooperation between SONEDE and the Greater Tunis
District and Government agency reponsible for planning the
development of the Tunis metropolitan area; and
(iii)    help assure  pricing adequate  to generate  part  of  the funds
needed for future expansion of water supply facilities.
Project Description
2.03     The project consisted of the construction of facilities to meet the
potable water needs of the northern governorates of Tunis, Tunis-Sud, Beja,
Jendouba and Nabeul to the year 1990 and technical assistance. The four major
components were:
(i)    production facilities, including an earth dam to create a 12
Mm3 reservoir, two pumping stations, transmission pipelines
and a water treatment plant;
(ii)    extension of the distribution system in Greater Tunis, including
installation of two primary mains, the expansion and improvement
of the secondary distribution network and upgrading of booster
pumping stations;
(iii)    the extension of distribution systems,  including expansion of
the primary sytems, improvement of the secondary distribution
networks and upgrading or storage and booster pumping in Beja,
Madjez-el-Bab, Pont du Fahs, and South Nabeul; and
(iv)    a  study  to  assist  SONEDE  in  developing  and  adapting  its
management information system in accordance with the needs of
its future expansion.
Revisions to the original project scope are discussed in para 3.02.
Loan Covenants
2.04     The loan documents included the following main covenants:
(i)    SONEDE should maintain water rates adequate to enable it to earn
a minimum return of 6% in 1977, and 7.52 in subsequent years, on
its net fixed assets in operation, properly valued in a manner
acceptable to the Bank; mainly because the system of accounts in
Tunisia is based on historical costs, this covenant was changed
in May 1982 to a cash-flow/contribution to investment covenant
under a subsequent project (Sixth Water Supply Project, Loan
2134-TUN; see para 5.20 below);
(ii)    SONEDE was to enter into an agreement with the Tunis District
for their future cooperation regarding the construction of the
water distribution system in Greater Tunis;



- 4 -
(iii)    beginning with its annual budget for 1978, the Government was to
provide the municipalities with the financial means necessary to
assure timely payment of their water bills; and
(iv)    the Government was to make available to SONEDE a contribution of
US$23 million for the project and, if necessary, any additional
funds required to meet cost overruns, should SONEDE be unable to
provide them.
2.05     Each of these covenants was met except  for  the  revenue  covenant
(paras 5.09 and 5.10).
m. PROJECT IMPLI EMAL-ATATION, COST AND OPERATION
Effectiveness
3.01     A special condition of effectivenes; required that a loan agreement
be signed with an external lender to ensure adequate financing of the
distribution works in Greater Tunis.  It was only on December 14, 1977 that
the Government signed a loan of about US$23.4 million equivalent with the
Kuwait Fund for Arab Economic Development and the Bank Loan 1445-TUN became
effective on January 30, 1978, about three months later than originally
envisaged (November 2, 1977).
Revisions
3.02     The  most  important  revisions  to  the  project  scope  concern  the
capacities of the production facilities and the distribution facilities in the
Greater Tunis area which were generally increased by 10% to 60% according to
the components.   The nominal pumping capacity from the Medjerdah canal  is
3.5 m3/s.  instead  of  2.8  m3/s.;  treatment  plant  capacity  is  2  m3/s.
instead of 1.4 m3/s., and primary distribution pipes  have  a diameter  of
1,600 mm instead of 1,250 mm.  The main reason why the pumping and pipeline
capacities of the production facilities were increased is because during the
design stage, a detailed study of the periods of unavailability of the
Medjerdah - Cap Bon Canal as a source of water supply due to too high water
salinity or repairs showed that peak pumping should be increased in order to
deliver a sufficient average water production. The main reason why the sizes
of primary distribution pipes in Greater Tunis were increased is because
considerations of space for laying pipes in Longested areas and trafic
interruptions needed to carry out the works led to the decision to size the
pipes for the horizon 2000 instead of 1990 as orginally envisaged.  Finally,
the construction of two booster stations was postponed to a later stage. All
the revisions were reasonable and only reflect the fact that the appraial was
made on the basis of preliminary engineering studies and not detailed design.
Annex 1 shows a comparison between project elements as appraised and as
actually constructed.



-5-
hmplementation
3.03     The  project  was  implemented from mid-1977 to mid-1984.   In 1978,
SONEDE met one of the loan covenants (see above 2.04 (ii)) by entering into an
agreement with the Tunis District for coordination of their activities  in
Greater Tunis.  Cooperation between them went smoothly.  Bid documents were
prepared by  foreign  engineering firms but supervision of construction was
carried out by SONEDE's own staff, except for the earth-dam reservoir for
which SONEDE was assisted by a foreign engineering firm. Parts of the works
were commissioned by mid-1981 and contributed to SONEDE's water sales for this
calendar year.  All project components were in operation by mid-1984,  two
years behind original schedule. Factors for delays were:
(i)    limited  experience  of  SONEDE's  staff  in  contracting  for
treatment plant and pumping stati3ns;
(ii)    fire accident in a control room in 1982;
(iii)    modifications  to  surge  protection  devices  in  some  pumping
stations; and
(iv)    laying of distribution pipes  more  difficult  than anticipated
because the terrain was often geologically poor a-id obstructed
by unexpected utility lines. Annex 2 shows a comparison between
appraisal and actual construction schedules.
Procurement and Disbursements
3.04     Civil  works,  equipment  and  pipes  for  the  production  facilities
financed under the loan were procured through international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for procurement and the
provisions set forth in Schedule 4 to the loan agreement.  The distribution
facilities in Greater Tunis were procured and funded under parallel firnancing
from the Kuwait  Fund.   To  speed up project execution,  SONEDE decided to
combine equipment supply and civil works in two turn-key contracts for two
major works, a water treatment plant and pumping stations, instead of placing
separate contracts for equipment supply and civil works.  In order to maintain
its original share of the project financing, the Bank accepted to finance the
foreign expenditures under the equipment category (financed at a rate of 100%)
and the local expenditures under the civil works category (financed at a rate
of 39%). Also, contrary to the original expectations, more pipes, valves and
fittings were locally purchased and paid in dinars while having a high
indirect foreign exchange component. For procurement of pipes, materials and
equipment, the original Loan Agreement provided only disbursement on foreign
expenditures.   In order to finance the full foreign exchange cost  of  the
production facilities, the Bank agreed on November 1982 to amend Schedule 1 of
the Loan Agreement to allow financing of 70% of local expenditures for pipes,
materials and equipment.  Appraisal and actual loan disbursements by fiscal
year and by category appear in Annex 3.



-6-
Costs
3.05     Total project costs (Annex 4) amounted to TD49.48 million as compared
to TD 43.73 million at appraisal, i.e. an increase of 13.1%.  The net increase
of TD5.75 million is made up of a number of factors, the most important of
which are:
(a)    pumping  and   instrumentation   oL  production  facilities:  an
increase of TD3.34 million, due to increa.sed capacity;
(b)    primary distribution system in Greater Tunis:  an increase  of
TD3.74 million due also to increased capacity; and
(c)    secondary distribution system in Greater Tunis: a decrease of
TD2.07 million because of postponement of construction of some
pipelines to a later stage.
This result is very favorable considering the overall increases in project
scope (para 3.02).  Actually, the prices obtained by SONEDE were relatively
low because of good competition between contractors and suppliers. Expressed
in US$, the total project cost (Annex 4, page 2) is 8.32 less than originally
estimated, but this is misleading because the high value of the US dollar
compared with the Tunisian Dinar during the construction period.
Performance of Consultants, Contractors and Suppliers
3.06     The performance of engineering consultants, contractors and suppliers
was generally good.   The engineering consultant chosen  for  the  production
facilities performed very well for the design of the earth dam reservoir, and
reasonably well for the pumping stations where some adjustments needed to be
made on the surge protection facilities.
Reporting
3.07     SONEDE, which supervised most of the works with its own staff, was
generallly late (from 3 to 17 months) in submitting quarterly progress
reports.   The  situation  mproved  in  1984 when  SONEDE  prepared  summarized
information regarding all projects under construction in only one report sent
to all its lenders.
IV. OPERATING AND INSTITUTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Operational Aspects for the Project Area
4.01     Although  the  last  project  components  were  placed  in  service  by
mid-1984, about two years later than foreseen at appraisal, the first project
components were already placed in service by mid-1981 and permitted SONEDE to



- 7 -
avoid water shortages in Greater Tunis during the summer of 1981. Except for
some minor adjustments being made on the check valves of the pumping stations,
the facilities constructed under the project appear to be working very well.
From 1976 to 1984, about 152,400 Pew c*.-nections were installed in the four
northern governorates of the project area. In 1985, the total volume of water
sold in the project area reached 76 million m3 , about 16% less than expected
at appraisal because tourism and industrial facilities in Greater Tunis
developed less than foreseen at appraisal.  Out of this volume, about  14.1
million m3 were produced and distributed through the facilities constructed
under the project (Annex 5).
Operational Aspects for the Executing Agency
4.02     Considering  all  the  areas  served  by  SONEDE,  indicator  levels
specified at appraisal were generally exceeded (Annex 6).  The percentage of
urban population connected to the water supply systems already reached 81% in
1983 instead of 1985 as targeted  (para 2.02).  Total water sold  in  1985
reached 160 million m3. about 13% more than expected at appraisal (despite
the fact that water soid in the project area was 16X less than expected at
appraisal).   Total  water  produced  in  1981  reached  about  205 million  M3,
about 17X more than expected at appraisal.   The total numbers of existing
connections over the 1976-1984 period were above the numbers estimated at
appraisal. Unaccounted-fur water was equal or above 292 during the 1981-1985
period, slightly above the target of 28X. Practically all SONEDE distribution
pipes are in asbestos-cement, material more fragile but less expensive than
steel or ductile iron, and SONEDE's performance is not directly comparable to
systems in developed countries where the proportion of pipe in asbestos-cement
is limited. Also, in 1984, the number of employees per thousand customers was
6.9, about 47% more than expected, but the number decreased steadily over the
years from the high level of 10.7 in 1976 (Annex 6).
Orgaization
4.03     The proje.t contained a study to assist SONEDE in developing and
adapting its management information system (para 2.03, (iv)). The study was
carried out by SONEDE staff (Directorate of Audit and Organization) and not by
outside consultants as expected at appraisal. It was satisfactorily completed
by February 1979. Over the years, SONEDE's structures have been improved and
its management information system developed.  Presentiy, SONEDE's management
information system is partly computerized and works well.
Institutional Growth
4.04     SONEDE's activities  have  grown  considerably as  a  result  of this
project and other projects during the period.  Between 1978 and 1984, the
company's net fixed assets nearly tripled and the number of customers
increased by 77 percent. The appraisal projected 615,000 customers at the end
of 1984; the actual number was 616,000.  Staff salaries and fringe benefits
are competitive, and SONEDE has no difficulty in recruiting and retaining
qualified staff. There was practically no high level staff turnover during



the project execution.  Staff training needs were met with the assistance of
the   "Office   de   l'Emploi   et   de   la   Formation   Professionnelle",   a
Government-operated agency.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
5.01     Appraisal and actual Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Sources
and Applications of Furnds Statements for the years 1976 to 1984 appear in
Annex 8.
Financial Results
5.02     In the period 1976-1984,  the number of customers  increased at an
average rate of 10.4% per year, compared to the appraisal estimate of 10.5X.
Total water sales increased at a rate of 6.4% per year, higher than estimated
(4.7%) mainly because the consumption per connection was greater than had been
estimated  (Annex 6).  The water tariff reached DT 0.238/m3 in 1984, higher
than estimated (DT 0.222); but on average during the nine year period, the
average tariff was 22 lower than anticipated. Water revenue reached TD38.4
million in 1984, about ',% higher, and total revenue was about 252 higher than
estimated.   Compared with revenue in 1976,  revenu  in 1984 increased by a
factor of 4.16, against an estimated increase of 3.42.
5.03     Throughout the period, operating expenses were close to .he estimate
except for the costs of personnel and energy, which respectively increased by
factors of 4.36 and 6.72, compared to estimated factors of 1.96 and 2.16%.
While  the  ratios  of  staff per connection and volume sold per staff have
improved, salary levels increased more than estimated.  Higher increases of
energy costs reflected the increased cost of fuel on a worldwide basis.
5.04     Over 1976-1984, total operating expenses increased 3.89 times while
total revenues increased 4.16 times; but because the expense increases were
more than expected, net operating income for 1984 reached only TD13.5 million,
against TD19.80 million projected. In 1984, net operating income represented
24% of total revenues, against 48% projected.
5.05     Interest  charges  were  higher than had been foreseen at appraisal
because of higher than exptected rates during the period 1976-1984, and
because SONEDE's capital expenses and borrowings were more than expected
(TD314 million spent instead of TD220 million). Furthermore, for many of its
new loans, SONEDE had to bear the foreign exchange risk. From 1982 onwards,
foreign exchange losses were substantial because of increases of exchange
rates for the US$ and the Kuwait Dinar.  Interest charges as a proportion of
total revenues increased from 8% in 1976 to 18% in 1984.   Over the period
1976-1984, net income after interest stayed within the range of zero to three
million Dinars, as compared to a projected result increasing from 2 million to
16 million Dinars.

Finan.ing Plan
5.06     SONEDE's actual financing during the period 1976-1984 may be compared
with the financing plan at appraisal as follows:
1977-1984 (TD Million)
---Appraisal---           -Actual--
Amount         %          Amount         %

Government Contributions                 50.0         23           85.6         27
Customer Contributions                   57.2         26           63.7         20
Capital Investments                     220.3        1DQ
5.07     In the 1976-84 period, net internal cash generation provided about
llX of capital investments as compared with 29% foreseen at appraisal.
Borrowings represented 42% of capital investments instead of 22%, making up
internal cash generation shortfalls.  Government contributions were slightly
higher than expected, both in total amount and as a percentage of capital
investment, while customer contributions represented a lower percentage.  The
share of both contributions taken together in terms of percentage of capital
investment was almost as forecast.
Financial Position
5.08     From 1976 to 1979, SONEDE's debt/equity ratio decreased; but this was
reversed from 1980 to 1984 so that in 1984 the capital structure was close to
what  it was  in  1976.  The actual  result reflects larger investment  than
forecast from 1980 onwards and lower earned surplus. Although not as low as
had been anticipated, SONEDE's debt/equity ratio in 1984 was 43:57, which may
be considered satisfactory.  Presently, collection from private consumers is
very effective (less than 1.5 months outstanding) but collection from
municipalities  is  slow  (about  8-9  months).   However,  compared  with  the
situation in 1976, collection from municipalities has improved since the
Government, in accordance with one of the loan covenants (para 2.04 (iii)),
issued Decree No. 77-988 on November 22, 1977 to try to enable SONEDE to



- 10 -
receive full payment for water consumed b7 local and municipal authorities
within a reasonable time.
Revenue Covenants
5.09     SONEDE's returns on the historical value of its net fixed assets in
operation, including those of rural centers, were 12.2% in 1979, 7.8% in 1980,
and 4.1% in 1981 1 '.  Although separate figures have not been available for
rural centers, it is estimated that their exclusion would add to the above
rates of return approximately one percentage point. Because asset revaluation
would result in substantial reductions in the rates of return indicated, it is
clear that SONEDE's performance in 1980 and 1981 did not meet the minimum
return of 7.5% prescribed in the Loan Agreement. The deficiency is, however,
not considered to have been a significant one.
5.10     Because the system of accounts in Tunisia was based on historical
costs (as it still is), and because of the difficulty in excluding assets of
-'rural centers", the Bank agreed in 1982 in negotiating the loan for the Sixth
Water Supply Project (Loan 2134) to substitute from 1982 onwards a cash
generation/contribution  to  investment  covenauit  for  the  rate  of  return
covenant.  The new covenant was designed to establish revenue levels taking
account of forecast needs for growth in working capital as well as for system
expansion (specifically, the revenue level which would be considered minimally
adequate would produce net internal cash generation covering the yea 's
"increase" in working capital other than cash plus 20% of one third of the
estimated capital expenditures of the current and two following years). The
form of the covenant was intended to smooth the effect of variations in
planned future investment expenditures for purposes of current tariff setting,
but it did not provide for smoothing in cases of working capital change.  As
it happened, therefore, the results achieved in 1982, 1983, 1984 calculated
according to the covenant formula were "self-financing percentages of 32%, 3%,
and 121, respectively, compared to the covenanted minimum of 202, because of
major variations in working capital during these years. In 1982, for example,
because of increases in accounts payable, the "increase" in working capital
was negative, resulting in 321 self-financing for the year. In our view, such
variations in working capital should not be interpreted under the framework of
the covenant as calling for corresponding swings in tariffs (to meet the 201
criterion), and the figures of 32%, 31, and 12% cited give a misleading
picture of performance.  SONEDE's self-financing ratios for each of the years
in question excluding working capital changes were 11, 181, and 151,
respectively, figures which more closely represent what was "contributed" by
customers to capital expenditures during each year, and which we believe are a
more useful indicator of the adequacy of the tariffs at the time.
IX' The Loan Agreement calls for asset revaluation and for exclusion of the
value of assets in communities with less than 2,000 inhabitants (1'rural
centers").



- 11 -
5.11     SONEDE was committed not to incur any new long-term debt without the
Bank's concurrence, if its projected net annual income before depreciation and
interest should fall below 1.5 times the projected annual debt service. Debt
service coverage during the execution of the Project was always above 1.5 up
to 1983, but dropped to 1.13 in 1984.
5.12     Section 5.02 of the Loan Agreement calls for SONEDE's accounts and
financial statements to be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank.  The audits were performed by a qualified private Tunisian firm and
accepted by the Bank.   The audit reports were submitted to the Bank with
delays beyorid the six months time limit resulting from the time spent by
SONEDE in reviewing the reports. As a result, under the Seventh Water Supply
Project (Loan 2368-TUN of February 1984), the submission time limit was
modified to nine months.
VI. PROJECT JUSTIFICATION
Proiect Achievements
6.01     The major objective of the project, to meet increasing water demand
in four northern governorates and help SONEDE to provide at least 811 of the
expected 1985 urban population with house-connections has been met (paras 4.01
and 4.02).   Thanks to the project,  during the 1977-1985 period, more than
900,000 additional people located in the project area benefited from new
connections to the water supply system.
leat cost solution
6.02     The use of the Medjerdah River to increase the water supply in the
project  area was  the  least  cost  alternative.   Apart  from  the earth dam
reservoir, construction of the production facilities were phased, the first
phase for the horizon 1990 only being constructed under the project.
Construction of distribution facilities were also phased, but with different
design horizon depending on the components.
Ecomao'ic Anysis
6.03     At the time of appraisal, incremental water revenues were used as a
minimum measure of economic benefits.  On this basis, the internal rate of
return for the project was 8.62.
6.04     Using the same method, with shadow prices to exclude taxes included
in costs, the internal rate of return has been recalculated with actual costs,
actual/projected incremental volumes of water sold/to be sold and the latest
tariffs applied in February 1985.  As detailed in Annex 7, the new rate of
return is 10.31. A variation of plus or minus 20% in incremental revenues and
operating costs would result in returns varying between 5.61 and 13.51. The
long-term incremental cost of water has been recalculated at TDO.350/ms in
1985 prices (Annex 7).

VII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
conclusions
7.01     The major project objective which consisted in augmenting the water
supply to the northern governorates in Tunisia has been met. Thanks to the
parts of the works which were commissioned in the middle of 1981, water cuts
were  not necessary  in Tunis  during  the  sunmer  1981  (para  3.03).   Costs
expressed in Dinars were only 13% higher than estimated (para 3.05) although
the capacities of the facilities were generally increased (para 3.02).  The
company's financial performance was not up to the levels targeted but
nevertheless was considered satisfactory.
Lessons Learned
7.02     This  project  confirms  again  the  importance  of  the  practice  now
generally used to appraise only on the basis of detailed engineering studies,
and not of preliminary design studies (para 3.02), in order to avoid important
revisions to the project scope.
7.03     Studies  to  develop  SONEDE's  management  information  system  were
satisfactorily completed by SONEDE's own staff, instead of management
