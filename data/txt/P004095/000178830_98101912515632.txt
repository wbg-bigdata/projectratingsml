THIRD AGRICULTURAL CREDIT PROJECT
1. BACKGROUND
A. Introduction
1.01      The Government of the Republic of Korea (GOK) has requested Bank
assistance in financing a third agricultural credit project through the
National Agricultural Cooperatives Federation (NACF). The project would
cost US$114.2 million. The Bank would contribute US$50 million, disbursed
over four and half years; this would cover 100% of the foreign exchange
costs. It would enable NACF to continue the lending activities initiated
under the previous two projects, and to expand the project-s scope to
include lending for the establishment of small-scale agro-processing and
chilled storage facilities, and improvement of the marketing of fruits and
vegetables.
1.02      The project was prepared by NACF.  This report reflects the
findings of an appraisal mission that visited Korea in June-July 1980,
consisting of Messrs. F.I.H. Moreithi, A. Hasan, R.G. Deshpande, J. Macgregor
(Bank), and B.C. Bilbo and R.W. Jessup (consultants).
B. Agricultural Sector
General
1.03      During 1970-79, Korean agriculture grew, in real terms, at an
average annual rate of 4.2% compared to 9.9% for the economy as a whole.
The more rapid growth of the other sectors has meant a steady decline in the
relative importance of agriculture. Between 1970 and 1979, agriculture's
contribution to GNP fell from 30.4% to 20%, to total exports from about
12.0% to 9.9%, and to employment from 50% to 35%. In absolute terms, agri-
cultural labor force fell from a peak of 5.6 million in 1976 to 4.9 million
in 1979. Nonetheless, agriculture continues to play a vital role in the
Korean economy particularly in terms of food supply, rural incomes and
employment, and foreign exchange earnings. Agricultural exports, including
fish products, rose sharply from US$111.3 million in 1970 to US$;1,493.4
million in 1979.
1.04      Korean agriculture is founded on owner-operated smallholdings,
numbering about 2.2 million (Annex 1, Table 1). The average holding has
remained small, at about 1.0 ha per household. Two thirds of the holdings
are less than 1.0 ha. The land reform enacted in the late 1940s set a
ceiling of 3 ha per holding of rice land; this has helped to keep the number
of landless farmers low, at about 4% of farm households.



- 2 -
1.05      Only 22% of the total land area of 9.9 million ha is cultivable,
while about 67% comprises forest land too infertile or mountainous for
cultivation (Annex 1, Table 1). There is therefore little scope for
expanding the cultivated area. Rice is the major crop and takes about 56%
of the cultivated land. The balance, mostly unirrigated upland fields, is
used for various crops such as barley, wheat, rye, millet, tobacco,
mulberry, ginseng, fruits and vegetables. An increasing area of otherwise
uncultivated hillside land is being put under pasture for integrated dairy
and beef cattle. Nearly 86% of the paddy land is irrigated but due to
adverse climate, only one crop of rice is possible. A rice-barley rotation
is widely practiced, while a rice-vegetable rotation is becoming common in
many areas as growing of vegetables in greenhouses spreads. Land utilization
intensity is about 131% of the cultivable area.
1.06      Rice production has been rising sharply from 3.9 million tons in
1970 to 5.6 million tons in 1979. This sharp rise has been due to the
remarkable increase in rice yield which rose from an average of 3.3 tons/ha
to 4.5 tons/ha between 1970 and 1979. The increase in yields has in turn
been the result of a number of factors, notably: the increased planting of
HYV, improvement and expansion of irrigation coupled with land consolidation,
and intensive application of crop production and protection inputs. The
national price support and subsidy policies (para. 1.14) have also played a
major role in stimulating increased production of rice. On the other hand,
despite similar measures, barley production has been fluctuating without a
discernible long-term trend partly because of the unfavourable consumer
preference but also because of relatively low returns to producers; planted
area fell by 35% but yields increased by 46% between 1970 and 1979. The
Government plans to keep barley production high to utilize land during the
winter season and to provide cheap food for the poor.
1.07      The Korean conditions are not well suited to the production of the
other grains such as wheat and maize. The available wheat varieties take a
long time to mature, thus conflicting with the time for planting rice;
the trend in relative producer prices has also been moving in favor of rice
compared to wheat cultivation. The area planted to wheat has therefore been
declining sharply. Wheat production fell from 219,000 tons in 1970 to
42,000 in 1979. The production of feedgrains, mostly maize, has remained
negligible; the country relies heavily on imports (para. 1.10).
Sector Issues, Policies and Strategies
1.08      The agricultural sector has been undergoing structural changes
characterized by trends towards:  demand for the staple foodgrains rising
more rapidly than domestic production; shifting consumption patterns in
favor of high-value crops and livestock products; growing labor shortages
during the peak season; renewed gap between rural and urban incomes;
mounting deficits in the operations of the national price support schemes,
particularly for foodgrains; and higher domestic production costs



- 3 -
for the major crops and Livestock compared to international costs.  These
trends also underlie the main issues bearing on Korean agricultural
policies, priorities and programs.
1.09      The basic national policy aims at increasing self-sufficiency in
staple food crops and improving the welfare of the various segments of
society, especially the rural communities. To this end, the Government has
pursued a strategy of maximum self-sufficiency particularly in rice and
barley, and also in several other crops and livestock. This strategy is
translated into operational programs through measures aimed at imnproving
research and extension; promoting the use of HYV, fertilizers and
agro-chemicals; promoting investments in irrigation and land consolidation;
providing credit; improving marketing and storage; and maintaining high
farmgate prices coupled with subsidized farm inputs.
1.10      Self-sufficiency in rice /1 was achieved in 1975 and 1'377, but the
level of self-sufficiency fell to 86% during 1979 and 503,000 toIns of rice
had to be imported; partly because of unfavorable weather, imports for 1980
are expected to be considerably higher. Between 1970 and 1979, wheat
imports remained relatively stable fluctuating between 1.6 and 1.9 million
tons; on the other hand, feedgrain imports rose sharply from 532,000 tons to
2.9 million tons reflecting the rapid expansion of livestock development
during the period. The overall level of self-sufficiency (ratio of domestic
production of all grains to consumption) fell from 80% in 1970 to 62% in
1979. This trend is expected to continue.
1.11      Rising incomes have stimulated a marked and continuing shift in
consumer demand away from the staple grains towards high-value commodi-
ties such as meat, dairy products, fish, fruits and vegetables. The Gov-
ernment has therefore had to institute measures to support farmer efforts
to increase the production of the high-value commodities. These measures
have included credit for investments in sprinkler irrigation, greenhouses,
and storage of fruits and vegetables, and strengthening of research and
extension services. The proposed project would support these measures by
providing credit to increase the production of fruits and vegetables.
1.12      The migration of rural population to urban areas and the more
rapid growth of the nonagricultural sectors has continued to reduce the
agricultural labor force, thus creating shortages in the supply of farm
labor especially during the peak seasons. To lessen this problem, the
Government has been supporting selective mechanization of farming
activities,, particularly the peak season tasks such as land preparation,
transplanting and harvesting. The proposed project would modestly help to
ease farm labor shortages among the fruit farmers by providing credit for
motorized sprayers for orchards.
/1 Barley production is usually above the human consumption requirements.



1.13      The balance between rural and urban incomes depends primarily on
the relative productivity of and the tec-ms of trade between agriculiture and
the other sectors.  Partly as a result of limiited land resources and the
rising average age of farm operators, labor productivity in agriculture has
lagged behind the other sectors to the effect that whereas 35% of the labor
force is in agriculture, it produces oaly about 20% of GNP.  In view of
virtual absence of new cultivable lands and limited scope for multiple
cropping, national efforts to increase Lhe productivity of rural labor have
focused on improving crop yields, expanding the production of high-value
crops and livestock, facilitating a steady rise in the average size of farm
holding, promoting selective mechanization; and creating off-farm employment
opportunities in the rural areas. The proposed project would improve the
productivity of the agricultural labor and terms of trade through: expanding
the production of high-value crops notably fruits and vegetables; creating
off-season employment from the growing of vegetables under greenhouses; and
assisting the construction of storage Facilities thus enabling the farmers
to take advantage of the higher off-season prices.
1.14       Compared to 1965-70, the trend of the agricultural terms of trade
improved appreciably until the mid-1970s but have recently tended to worsen./l
The improvement was partly the result of the agricultural price support
schemes. Introduced in late 1960s, these schemes cover mostly rice and
barley, and are partly aimed at improving the agricultural terms of trade
and effecting transfer of income in favor of the rural areas. Undler the
schemes, involving 23% and 37% of respectively rice and barley consumption
in 1979, the Government procures farm produce at a price above and releases
it at a price below the market price (the ratio of release to procurement
prices was 75.5% for rice and 44.8% for barley in 1978). For this reason
and also the fact that the total volume handled under the schemes has been
rising steadily, the schemes have been operating at mounting deficits.
During the past decade, the annual deficit increased 75-fold reaching

items, the trends in agricultural terms of trade are as follow

US$430 million in 1979 (at the then current exchange rate), bringing the
cumulative total deficit to US$1,507 million.  Under the next Five-Year Plan
(1982-86) now being formulated, the Government intends to restructure the
agriculture income support program.  A Bank Structural Adjustment lo.n
mission is currently discussing with GOK a phased plan for eliminati-ng the
fertilizer subsidy and reducing the Grain Management Fund deficits.
C. Project Main Subsectors
1.15      Fruits occupy about 3.1%. and vegetables 11.6% of the cropped land.
During 1979, they accounted respectively for 3.5% and 22.1% of the value of
agricultural production. As a result of rising incomes, the food
consumption pattern has been markedly shifting from the traditional staples
in favor of the high value commodities, notably fruits, vegetables, fish and
livestock products. Thus, the annual per capita consumption of fruits and
vegetables rose from 83 kg in 1970 to 240 kg in 1979, while during the
same period the per capita consumption of rice fell from 136 kg to 135 kg./l
Partly as a result of the sharp rise in demand, the prices of fruits and
vegetables have been rising more steeply than those of the other major
crops./2  The total consumption for fruits rose from about 422,000 tons in
1970 to 856,000 tons in 1979, while for vegetables it rose from 2.2 million
tons to 8.2 million tons. The trend is expected to continue (Table 5.1).
1.16      The national policy is to increase the production of fruits and
vegetables to meet the rising demand. The main strategy to this end aims at
expanding the area devoted to orchards and vegetables, increasing yields
through irrigation in upland areas, promoting techniques that enable the
growing of vegetables during the winter season, and providing storage for
off-season supply of both fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, the growing
shortage of farm labor has necessitated introduction of labor saving
machinery and equipment such as speed sprayers for orchards.
1.17      During the period 1970-79, production of fruits more than doubled
from 423,000 tons to 856,000 tons; production of vegetables more than
trebled from 2.5 million tons to 8.6 million tons./3 Apples account for
/1 Per capita consumption of barley declined from 38.9 kg in 1965 to
18.1 kg in 1978.
/2  During the period 1976-79 compared to 1975, the average wholesale price
of fruits rose by 206% and of vegetables by 175% compared to 169% for
staple grains.
/3 The consumption and production figures are different partly because of
market losses and imports and exports; the 1979 figures are provisional.

about half of the total fruit production.  Apart from the unavailability of
new land for expansion, the production of both fruits and vegetables is
constrained by several factors. Fruits suffer periods of moisture stress
during the hot summer months because most of the orchards are located on
sandy soils with low moisture retention capacity, or on hillsides, or on
excessively drained volcanic ash soils. Few of them are irrigated. Fruit
trees therefore suffer from slow growth, and produce smaller fruits and poor
quality crops. In the case of apples, moisture stress causes high incidence
of skin craciks and poor coloring which result in lower prices to the
producers.
1.18      Other constraints include lack of storage facilities, high labor
costs, and pests and diseases. TLack of storage facilities compels the
farmers to sell their produce immediately after harvesting when the prices
are lower than during the off-season. As labor costs rise, many of the
farmers are turning to motorized (speed) sprayers; a further factor behind
this trend is the health hazards to which people are exposed when using
other types of sprayers. The proposed project would help to lessen these
constraints by providing credit for sprinkler irrigation systems, on-farm
and chilled storage, and speed sprayers.
1.19      Most of the field-grown vegetables are grown under rainfed condi-
tions. They, too, suffer periodic drought and reduced yields. During the
winter season, there is ample land for growing vegetables in greenhouses,
and this mode of producing vegetables has expanded rapidly during the last
decade. However, about 70% of the existing greenhouses are of bamboo or
wooden frame which are susceptible to damage from snowfall and strong winds.
Their low roof li-mits plant growth while the numerous internal support
structures reduce the planted area and restrict efficiency of cultivating
operations, thus resulting in low yields. Lack of storage facilities also
depresses the prices that the farmers receive for vegetables such as
onions and garlic. The proposed project would accordingly provide credit
for the construction of metal greenhouses, and sprinkler irrigation systems
for vegetables. The on-farm and chilled storage financed by the project
would also be used for vegetables such as onions and garlic.
1.20      The demand for credit to expand the production of fruits and
vegetables is expected to remain strong as a result of population growth and
increase in per capita income. Many of the farmers now using wooden and
bamboo greenhouses are keen to replace them with metal ones, while those
with no greenhouses have come to appreciate the benefits from growing
vegetables during the off-season.
D. The Financial Institutions and Agricultural Credit
Financial Institutions
1.21      General.  The major issues of Korea's financial sector were
reviewed by a Bank mission that visited the country in November 1979. The
principal financial institutions are the Bank of Korea (BOK), Deposit Money
Banks (DMB) and Non-Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI). The Bank of Korea
performs the usual central banking functions. Government exercises close



-7-
- 7 -
control over most of these institutions, especially with regard to the
allocation of funds and determination of interest rates. Most of the DMB /1
and the large NBFI are directly or indirectly owned and controlled by the
Government. In addition to obtaining funds from the Government, these
institutions rely heavily on subsidized rediscounting facilities made
available by BOK. The Government, through the Monetary Board, also
periodically fixes interest rates on deposits and loans for all financial
institutions.
1.22      Deposit Money Banks (DMB) include commercial banks and the
specialized banks.  In 1979, commercial banks accounted for about 39% of the
assets of the financial sector. While they are authorized to make various
kinds of loans, they have traditionally concentrated on short-term lending
(about 90% of their loan portfolio). Deposits represent the major portion
of their funds and accounted for about 51% of their aggregate resources
(liabilities and equity) in 1979.  The specialized banks '2 aggregate assets
accounted for about 23% of total assets of the financial sector in 1979.
For these banks, deposits also play a significant role, accounting for about
58% of total resources. However, Government funds constitute a suhstantial
part of their term lending, accounting for about 50% of the outstanding
loans at the end of 1979.
1.23      Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries (NBFI) comprise the development
finance institutions,/3 life insurance companies, mutual saving institutions
and investment companies. They accounted for ahout 26% of total assets of
the financial sector in 1979. The Korea Development Bank (KDB) is the
largest of NBFI, accounting for about 50% of total NBFI-s assets.
Agricultural Credit
1.24     Institutional and Non-Institutional Credit.  According to a survey
carried out by MAF, the average total borrowings of the farm household in
1979 were about W 173.1 thousand (US$266.3). In the early 1960s,
non-institutional credit accounted for about 80% of rural credit: but, by
1979, it had fallen to 50%. Interest rates for non-institutional credit

and banking activities are concerned.

ranging from 30-50% p.a, ccmpare with 26%(   1 for an unsubsidized market rate
of interest.  Much of the increase in -nstitutional credit is attributable
to the establishment of NACF (para. 1.26).
1.25      The fact that the rural borrcwers in general and farmers in particu-
lar are willing and able to borrow hea;'ily froLm non-institutional sources,
and at such high interest rates, reflecils in part the high demand for credit
relative to the supply of loanable funds, even at the current market rate of
interest. It also means that as long as the expected return from the
various investments (Table 6.1) is higher than the interest charged,
many farmers would be willing and able lo borrow.
1.26      Main Lending Agencies and Agricultural Credit System.  NACF and its
member cooperatives are the principal so-urce of institutional agricultural
credit. They accounted for about 94% of the total institutional agricultural
credit during 1979. The remaining 6% came mostly from the other DMB (exclu-
ding NACF). NACF in particular has established a credit delivery and re-
covery system that now covers over 90% of the farmers in the country. The
system has been sufficiently responsive to the varying credit needs in
keeping with structural changes of the agricultural sector. Nonetheless,
there is need to improve the system pa-r-_icularly by simplifying lending
terms and conditions and increasing the degree of flexibility so as to be
able to respond more effectively to the increasing sophistication of the
agricultural sector.
Interest Rate and Inflation
1.27      During 1979, wholesale and consumer prices rose by over 18%
compared to 12-14% during 1978. For 1980, it is estimated that wholesale
prices will increase by about 45% and GNP deflator by about 30%. The
Government projects these increases at 20-25% and 19% respectively in 1981.
Over the Fifth Five Year Plan period (1982-86) the respective average
annual increases are projected at 9% and 11%, but actual increases may be
higher. At the beginning of 1980 GOK raised the interest rate payable for
agriculture subprojects, including those envisaged under the proposed
projects, from 12.0% to 18.5% (subsequently reduced to 17.5%) thus bringing
it closer to a positive real interest rate. Given the projected decline in
the rate of inflation, the interest rate structure stipulated under the
proposed project (para. 4.14) would result in a real rate of interest which
is positive over the long-run.
E. Extension Services and Research
1.28      The Office of Rural Development (ORD) of M4AT is the principal
agency responsible for agricultural extension and research. The other
important agency is the Agricultural Development Corporation (ADC) which
carries out most of the research relating to irrigation and land
improvement. The main thrust of both extension and research in Korea has
/1 During July 1980.



- 9 -
been directed towards foodgrains, particularly rice, barley and wheat.
Considerable achievements have been made as is attested by the Fact that
Korean rice yields are among the highest in the world. Much research has
also been done on mechanization, especially on small farm machinery.
1.29      The overall ratio of extension workers to farmers is about 1:500.
Foodgrains have taken most of the attention of both the extension and
research agencies, and have left little to spare for the needs of the other
crops. With the increasing emphasis now being placed on diversified
farming, there is a clear need to strengthen extension and research for the
other crops especially fruits, vegetables, and livestock, with a view to
enhancing the farmers capacity to cope not only with a wider range of crops
but also more sophisticated production technology involving the use of
advanced agricultural systems such as greenhouses and sprinkler irrigation
for fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, while the existing extension
services are essentially adequate for the proposed project, a more effective
liaison is needed between NACF, ORD and ADA (para. 4.05).
F. Bank Group Lending for Agriculture
Overview
1.30      The Bank's lending for the agricultural sector, includling rural
development, has financed 16 projects totalling US$540.5 million as follows:
(a) $188 million for irrigation works, land reclamation, consolida-
tion and improvement projects (Loan 600-KO, Loan 795-1(0, Credit
283-KO and Credit 1364-KO);
(b)  $22 million for two dairy development projects (Credit 234-KO and
Loan 1193-KO) to establish small and medium size dairy farms,
dairy processing plants and provision of technical assistance;
(c) $30.5 for two agricultural credit projects (Credit 335-KO and Loan
1328-KO) for lending to farmers to develop orchards, sericulture,
on-farm storage, irrigation, greenhouses, poultry and pigs;
(d)  $7 million for a seeds project (Loan 942-KO) for the development,
multiplication and distribution to farmers, of higher yielding
varieties of cereal crops, potatoes and oil seeds;
(e) $65 million for two area development projects (Loans 1319-KO and
*                  1503-KO) involving the construction of earthfill dams, main and
secondary canals, pumping stations, land development, village
access roads and drainage and irrigation improvements;
(f) $73 million for two agro-processing projects (Loans 994-KO and
1851-KO) for lending to processors for expansion and modernization
of agro-processing facilities and to farmers (Loan 994-KO only) for
on-farm production of export-oriented crops; and



- 10 -
(g) $155 million for two rural infrastructure projects (Loan 1216-KO/
1218T-KO and 1530-KO) involving the construction of minor
irrigation facilities, roads, bridges, water supply, electric and
telephone system, development of fuel wood blocks, and upland
reclamation.
1.31      These projects formed part of high priority Government development
programs to:
(a) expand and improve the productivity of agriculture, principally
rice and other foodgrains; diversify production in favor of higher
value crops; increase the supply and quality of processed
agricultural products to meet the rapidly rising consumer demand;
increase exports from the agriculture sector; and raise farmers'
income; and
(b) expand and improve rural infrastructure and amenities so as to
raise the quality of life and standard of living in the rural
areas.
The First Agricultural Credit Project (Credit 335-KO)
1.32      The first credit project provided funds to NACF for extending
medium- and long-term loan to the farmers for development of orchards,
sericulture, poultry and swine; and for construction of NACF's training
facilities, and consultants (para. 2.30-2.31). Of the total project cost
estimated at US$18.2 million, IDA financed 58% ($10.5 million), the
Government 23%, and participating farmers the remaining 19%. The principal
beneficiaries were to be growers with typical farm sizes ranging from one to
three hectares.
1.33      The project became effective in May 1973 and was completed
satisfactorily in May 1976, about a month ahead of schedule. As a result of
rising costs, and substantially larger amount for individual subloans, the
project made loans to about 6,000 farmers instead of 12,000 as expected at
appraisal. A substantial change also occurred in the composition of project
investments compared to appraisal estimates, primarily due to changing
product prices, technological and institutional factors and government policy.
The project helped to establish a technical unit (TU) in NACF (para. 4.02)
and brought in a total of 59 Kun Cooperatives (KC) to participate in
project-s lending. TU trained 123 Loan Appraisal Officers (LAO) for Kun
Cooperatives.
1.34      A PPAR was issued in November 1978./l  The PPAR concluded that the
project fulfilled its primary goals as it succeeded in promoting rapid
diffusion of technology, diversification of agricultural activities, and
/1 OED Report No. 2263.

institutional improvement in NACF. The rates of return were satisfactory
with FRR ranging from 29% to over 100% and ERR ranging from 20% to over 100%.
Loan repayment, too, was satisfactory (para. 1.39). The main problems iden-
tified were: inclusion of subprojects which were unsuitable because of
technical problems; inadequate attention by TU staff to proper subloan
appraisal methods and procedures during start-up; and slow progress in
selection of suitable consultants and in implementation of consultants'
recommendations (paras. 2.30-2.31). The first problem was resolved through
reallocation of funds; the second through greater attention given to this
aspect during supervision, and training of some TU staff at EDI. NACF
experienced difficulties in determining the expertise for the consultants
financed under the project; furthermore, the implementation of the
consultants' recommendation was hampered by several factors, especially
NACF's inability to understand the full import of the recommendations.
1.35      Overall, the OED report identified three important lessons:
"First, project preparation must be carried out together with the
implementing agency, and agreement on all major issues needs to be
established. Second, the negotiation process should give the Borrower
enough time to analyze all important issues. And third, if the Bank
requests that a foreign advisor or consultant be hired, the responsibility
would seem to rest with the Bank to explain in detail the specific
experience and knowledge that is required and to help the Borrower in
selecting candidates for such positions - the responsibility for the final
selection remaining with the Borrower." The first lesseon has been taken
into full account in the preparation of subsequent projects; the Borrower
was primarily responsible for preparing the proposed project. It is
intended to allow sufficient time during the negotiation to enable the
Borrower to analyze all important issues. The third lesson has no relevance
to the second and the proposed project.
The Second Agricultural Credit Project
1.36      This project was a continuation and expansion of the program
financed under the first project. The project envisaged loans to about
7,900 farms for apple orchards, silkworm rearing houses, sprinkler
irrigation for orchards, greenhouses for vegetable production, and on-farm
storage for fruits. Total project costs were estimated at US$41.2 million,
of which the Bank financed $20.0 million (49%), Government $8.8 million
(21%) and subborrowers $12.4 million (30%).
1.37      The project became effective in March 1977 and funds were fully
disbursed by the end of March 1980, about three months ahead of schedule.
Project lending for on-farm investments totalled W 20.0 billion involving
7,642 subloans (97% of appraisal estimate). Lending for greenhouses and
on-farm storage exceeded the appraisal estimate by 135% and 30%, respec-
tively, but this was offset by a corresponding decline in other subprojects,



- 12 -
mainly as a result of unforeseen price and demand changes. The project
funds were accordingly reallocated. The number of participating KCs rose by
241 to total of 347.
1.38      The project has contributed significantly to increased production
of fruits and vegetables. Furthermore, the increased number of
participating cooperatives and the expanded training of LAOs have enhanced
their capability to appraise and implement agro-investment projects.
Project implementation proceeded without any major problem, thus reflecting
the improved capability of NACF and the Kun Cooperatives to handle such
projects.
1.39      The loan repayment rate for both the first and the second projects
have been satisfactory; at the end of 1979, the arrears were 1.3% of the
outstanding loans; of this, only 28% was overdue for more than six months.
2. NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL COOPERATIVE FEDERATION (NACF)
AND MEMBER COOPERATIVES
A. Guiding Principles and Operation Scope
Corporate Goals
2.01      As a general corporate policy and in keeping with the basic coope-
rative principles, NACF and its member cooperatives place greater emphasis
on rendering services to their clients than on maximizing profits. Thus,
they undertake several non-income earning activities such as extension
services, staff training, and administration of government programs at cost.
They, however, aim at globally covering the cost of their various activities
by internally generated revenues, or subsidies in the case of the government-
directed programs. In general, they rely on the banking operations to
offset any losses in the other operations.
Operation Scope
2.02      NACF and its member cooperatives carry out a wide range of
activities: extension of agricultural credit; mobilization of funds through
their banking activities; distribution of agricultural inputs and farm
machinery; provision of processing and marketing facilities and services;
and insurance coverage for their members. They tlherefore play a vital role
in the implementation of the national agricultural policies and programs.
Their significance is reflected by the fact that they now account for 94% of
institutional credit to agriculture; 12.6% of the total outstanding loans,
and 14.9% of the total deposits under Korea's entire banking system; and
handle 21% of the total marketed agricultural commodities, 75% of farm
chemicals, machinery and equipment, and 100% of fertilizers.

B. Organizational Structure
Overall
2.03      NACF was created in 1961 as the apex body of, until the beginning
of this year, a three-tier cooperative structure, with Kun (county-level)
Cooperatives in the middle and Primary (village-level) Cooperat:ives at the
base (see Chart 1 and Chart 2).  The structure also includes Special
Cooperatives, organized on a commodity basis, mostly for horticulture and
livestock. Following the recommendation of a Committee set up by the
Government during the second project, Kun Cooperatives become branches of NACF
with effect from January 1981; as NACF branches, they concentrate on banking
and lending operations, leaving the other activities to the Primary
Cooperatives. There are now 1,490 Primary Cooperatives (PC), and 142 Special
Cooperatives (SC). The PC have a membership of 2 million, thus covering over
90% of the farm households, while the SC have 58,000 member farmers.
2.04      The activities of the member cooperatives are directed by a Board
of Directors elected annually by the member farmers; an executive director
is responsible for the day-to-day operations. The number of staff varies
from one cooperative to another according to the volume of bus-iness. The
staff of most of the PC and all the SC include general extension staff for
technical advisory services to the member farmers. As a whole,, the
cooperatives have a total staff of about 41,000.
National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF)
2.05      Organization and Staffing.  NACF is wholly autonomous in its
day-to-day operations and management. It is, however, subject to general
policy directives by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF). Its
operational policies and procedures are formulated by a Steering Committee
consisting of the NACF President (appointed by the President of Korea);
representatives of MAF, Ministry of Finance, and Bank of Korea (BOK); and five
cooperative delegates appointed by the General Assembly of the Cooperatives.
The president is assisted by two senior vice-presidents and six vice-
presidents. In general, its organizational structure is along functional
lines (see Chart 2).
2.06      NACF has a total of 149 branches spread throughout the country
and a staff numbering about 4,000. Many of the staff, about 40%, have
university education. The staff turnover is low, about 7% in 1979. Staff
training and development, for all cooperative staff, are conducted at its
Central Training Institute and five provincial training centers. The
facilities are adequate while the quality and level of training are consistent
with the present and future needs of NACF and its member cooperatives.

C. Main Functions
Member Cooperatives
2.07       Primary Cooperatives (PC).  The key role of the PC is to maintain
the day-to-day contact with the general farmers, while SC do the same for
horticultural and livestock farmers. Their main functions include extension
of short-term credits, mobilization of rural savings through mutual credit
schemes, distribution of farm inputs and consumer goods, assembling and
marketing members- produce, and providing general technical advisory services.
Thus, the PC own and run such facilities as marketing centres and chain stores
in small towns, warehouses and grain mills. Most PC also operate a mutual
credit scheme aimed at mobilizing savings in the rural areas. By the end of
1979, PC had mobilized mutual credit deposits amounting to W 590 billion (US$
1.02 billion), and accounted for about 40% of the total cooperatives
deposits.
2.08       Special Cooperatives (SC).  The SC do not engage in deposit
mobilization. Their main functions are: specialized technical advisory
services, supply of farm inputs, and marketing of members produce. They own
and operate processing facilities, mostly for dairy products.
National Agricultural Cooperative Federation (NACF)
2.09       General.  NACF plays the central role in guiding, coordinating and
supervising cooperative activities. It serves as the apex bank, accepting
surplus deposits from member cooperatives, and the channel for injecting
governmental and other external funds into the cooperative system, down to
the farmers. It plays a special role in the training of all the cooperative
staff (para. 2.06). Generally, the member cooperatives pass on to NACF
those functions that are more efficiently done in a centralized manner,
thereby attaining greater operating efficiency. Accordingly, NACF
undertakes, at the national level: banking and lending operations;
procurement and distribution of farm inputs, machinery and equipment as well
as consumer goods; marketing of agricultural produce; and insurance schemes.
2.10       Banking and Lending Operations:  At the end of 1979, the amount of
deposits directly generated by NACF amounted to about 6% of the total
cooperatives- deposits. The large part of its deposits consist of deposits
by PC and KC. Of the total loans disbursed by cooperatives during 1979,
NACF direct lending accounted for about 19.1%, while KC and PC respectively
accounted for 34.0% and 46.9% (see Table 2.4). The main role of NACF in the
lending operations has hitherto been to inject external funds into the
cooperative system; but now that KC have become branches of NACF, its role
in lending directly to the farmers and generating deposits will increase
substantially.



- 15 -
2.11       Farm Inputs, Machinery and Equipment:  NACF is directly
responsible for centralized procurement of these items, and for arranging
their delivery to the various member cooperatives. As a multi-purpose
organization, NACF extends similar services for essential consumer goods.
During 1979, the goods handled by NACF under these activities amounted to W
1,018 billion (US$ 1.7 billion).
2.12       Produce Marketing:  NACF also provides marketing services to its
mermbers. To this end, it operates collection centers and warehouses
throughout the country.  It also owns and runs wholesale markets in the
major cities. During 1979, farm produce marketed through cooperatives
reached W 599 billion (US$ 1.2 billion), having risen from W 300 billion in
1975. As a whole cooperatives now account for about 21% of the farm produce
sold in the country; according to the major commodities, they account for
14% of the foodgrains, 40% of fruits and vegetables, and 20% of livestock
products.
2.13       Insurance.  NACF also provides damage and life insurance coverage.
The life insurance business was boosted up by the transfer of over 1 million
policies worth W 92 billion from the MIinistry of Communication to NACF in
1977. Effective life insurance policies amounted to W 406 billion, in 1979,
compar.g-d to W 150 billion in 1975; the premium received totaled W 39.8 bil-
lion. Damage insurances include livestock, fire, forest-fire, and
depositors welfare coverages. Total damage insurance during 1979 amounted
to W 1,395 billion, with the premium amounting to W 2.4 billion.
D. Lending Operations
Resources Mobilization and Utilization
2.14       Deposits:  The total resources of the cooperatives as a whole
amounted to W 2,805 billion (US$4.8 billion) in 1979, after growing at about
37% p.a. during 1975-79. A noteworthy feature of the cooperatives- resources
mobilization is the increase in the share of deposits with a corresponding
decline of dependence on Government funds. Deposits have been the most
rapidly growing source of funds as their contribution rose from 43% of total
resources in 1975 to 52% in 1979. Nearly 43.7% of the deposits during 1979
were generated from the urban areas. Table 2.1 summarizes the resources
position at the end of 1975 and 1979.

Source:  Mission estimates.  Accurate consolidated data for
total cooperative system are not available. Figures
here include resources of NACF and Kun cooperatives,
and mutual credit and equity of Primary cooperatives.
2.15       Overall, there has been an improvement in the availability of term
resources in that the share of the time and saving deposits increased from
about 50% in 1975 to 67% in 1979; on the other hand, this trend means rising
cost of deposit funds. Most of the deposits are used for credit in the
rural areas, mainly short-term loans. But while the aggregate amount of
loans from deposits has been rising,/l the proportion going to agriculture
has remained low at about 30%. This is mainly due to the lower interest
rate generally payable for agricultural loans compared to the cost of the
deposit funds. To encourage the use of deposits for agricultural credit,
the Government extends subsidies/2 to NACF to cover the difference between the
lending rate of interest and the cost of deposits; it also provides NACF
with low-cost funds to blend with deposits thus reducing the average cost of
funds.
2.16       Borrowed Funds:  All cooperative borrowings are routed through
NACF. Borrowings totalled W 662 billion at the end of 1979, with about 95%
originating from the Government (including government guaranteed foreign

loans) and BOK.  These funds are made available to NACF and the cooperatives
for firmly specified purposes, notably: procurement of fertilizers and other
farm inputs, agricultural machinery and equipment, export financing,
livestock development, and rural housing.
Composition and Maturity Structure
2.17      Table 2.2 shows the subsectoral and maturity structure of the
total cooperatives outstanding loans in 1975 and 1979. The amount
increased from W 308 billion in 1975 to W 1,141 billion in 1979. But the
share of agriculture remained more or less the same at about 59%. Most of
the non-agricultural lending goes to finance rural development activities
including rural housing. With regard to maturity, medium- and long-term
loans for agriculture, as a proportion of total outstanding loans,
fell from 45% in 1975 to about 33% in 1979. There was no change for the
non-agricultural lending as the proportion remained at 41%.

Conditions and Terms of Lending
2.18       Security Requirements.  All loans above W 1 billion require real
estate in addition to chattel mortgage. Land valuation is done by
cooperatives and does not take into acount the value added by the proposed

investment. Borrowers with insufficient collateral may avail themselves of
the credit guarantee coverage under the NACF Credit Guarantee Fund./l
2.19      Interest Rates.  Interest rates are set by the Government and are
generally below the present rate of inflation (para. 1.27). They also vary
widely primarily according to the purpose and source of funds but also, to
some extent, type of borrower (Annex 2, Table 4). At present, they range from
3% for forestry loan to 26% for short-term credit financed from PC-s mutual
savings and loan deposits.  Generally, due to the high cost of deposit funds
(at an average of 17.0%), interest rates are higher if financed fromn deposits.
Most of the medium- and long-term loans currently carry 16.5% interest rate,
but for certain types of agricultural mechanization the rate may be as high as
22%. Table 2.3 below summarizes the current interest rate structure.
Loan Approval Powers
2.20      Loan approval powers for term credit are sufficiently delegated.
NACF county branches may approve loans not exceeding W 5 million, and
provincial branches not exceeding W 30 million. Loans exceeding W 30
million are approved by NACF's head office.

2.21      Overall arrears declined from 7.4% in 1975 to 3.6% in 1979 (Annex 2,
Table 3). Most of the arrears relate to the short-term loans, particularly
mutual credit loans which accounted for about 75% of the arrears at the end of
1979. However, the arrears on mutual credit loans have also improved signif-
icantly from 33.4% (of mutual credit loans outstanding) in 1975 to 9.8% in
1979. Arrears on loans' other than mutual credit, were only 1.1% of such
loans outstanding.
E. NACF Financial Conditions and Performance
Financial Conditions
2.22      Total Resources:  Table 2.4 presents a summary of NACF Balance Sheet
for the last three years (see details, Annex 2, Table 4). Total resources
rose from W 1,186.3 billion (US$ 2.0 billion) in 1977 to W 2,067.7 billion
(US$ 3.6 billion) in 1979. With exception of equity which more than doubled
during the period, other accounts remained relatively stable.
/1 Established by the Government in 1972, and operated by NACE on an agency
basis, the Fund is financed from a fee of 0.5% p.a. payable by the
borrower, and 0.3% on outstanding loans payable by the Cooperatives.
The maximum guarantee units range from W 10 billion (for farmers and
fishermen) to W 100 million for special purpose cooperatives.

Debt-equity ratios /d         19.7:1             16.1:1            11.6:1
/a  Mainly general business inventories.
/b  In 1979, 44% were short-term, and 46% long-term borrowings; W 243 bil-
lion (37%) Government funds; W 319 billion (48%) BOK funds; W 58 billion
(9%) foreign funds; and W 12 billion (6%) other borrowings.
/c  Mainly insurance reserves and payables.
/d  Borrowings/equity.  Deposits have been excluded since they are covered
by legal reserves and in view of the steady flow of new deposits; other
liabilities have also been excluded because they consist mainly of
funded insurance reserves.
2.23      Liabilities and Equity:  Deposits continued to be the single
largest source of NACF funds, with their share increasing slightly from
46.9% in 1977 to 49.5% in 1979; about 93% comprise deposits from KC and
PC. Borrowings are the next largest source of funds and accounted for 32.0%
of total resources in 1979. Borrowings consist mostly of Government and BOK
loans (85% in 1979), made available to NACF for specific purposes. For



- 21 -
example, during 1979, about 75% (W 240 billion) of the BOK loans was for
financing of fertilizers operations, 17% (W 54 billion) for financing
mechanization, and the remaining 8% for export credit.
2.24      Although NACF equity increased substantially between 1977 and 1979,
it remains small in relation to total debt. The debt-equity raitio continues
to be high, but it improved from 19.7 in 1977 to 11.6 in 1979 (Table 2.4).
The high debt-equity ratio need not be a cause of serious concern since most
of the borrowings are governmental funds for government-directed programs. In
this respect, NACF serves essentially as the arm of the governm(ent for
implementing these programs.
Financial Performance
2.25       NACF Incomes.  Table 2.5 summarizes NACF income statement for the
last three years (see Annex 2, Table 8 for details). The net income in 1979
was 1.2% of average total assets, and was a notable improvement from 0.34% in
1977. This improvement was mainly due to an increase in the profitability of
the banking operations (from 0.47% of total average assets in 1977 to 0.88% in
1979), and a reduction in the losses from the other operations (from 1.2% of
gross sales in 1977 to 0.2% in 1979). These other operations are mostly
related to the Government-sponsored programs, and the revenues therefrom are
strictly controlled by the Government in the interest of keeping the costs to
the farmers low. The commissions received by NACF are accordingly low and
generally inadequate to bear their share of the overheads.

Audit
2.26       NACF accounts are audited by its auditors appointed by the General
Assembly, and independent auditors as required by the Bank under the
previous projects. In addition, BOK annually inspects NACF credit and
banking operations, while the Government's Board of Inspection and Audit
particularly audits the use of government funds.



- 22 -
Accounts and Management Information System
2.27      The accounting system of NACF and its member cooperatives is
designed to generate separate accounts for the general business, banking
business, and insurance business. However, the system does not facilitate
accurate allocation of interest and other overhead costs among the various
activities. With a view to rectifying this, the first Bank-supported
project financed a study by a consultant (completed in 1975) which
recommended, inter alia: identification of the costs of the service
department, and charging these costs to all the user departments; coding of
accounts to facilitate the maintenance of separate accounts by the various
departments and consolidating the whole NACF and member cooperative
accounting and reporting system.
2.28      These recommendations were accepted by NACF but their implementa-
tion was delayed by the failure to provide NACF with sufficient implementa-
tion guidelines, and the fact that the proposed codification of accounts
envisaged the use of a sophisticated computer. system. Moreover, the study
was conducted with insufficient involvement of the NACF staff to the effect
that NACF staff had little appreciation of the import of these recommenda-
tions. NACF has now made the necessary arrangements towards consolidating
the cooperative accounts for implementation during 1981. But the codifica-
tion of accounts and the introduction of cost centers and a cost sharing
system is expected to take longer to implement in view of the diversity of
the cooperative operations and high costs of computerizing the system.
2.29      With the exception of lending activities, NACF-s reporting system
is generally satisfactory. In the case of the non-Bank supported agricultural
lending activities, the general information system does not generate
sufficiently detailed data on such important aspects as the purpose of
loans, disbursements, amounts due, collections and maturity structure;
neither is information readily available on the consolidated lending by the
three levels of cooperatives. NACF is fully aware of these deficiencies and
is expected to review the matter and effect the necessary improvements
(para. 4.21).
3. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives and Scope
3.01      The project is expected to address some of the important problems
now facing Korean agriculture (para. 1.08). In particular, it would increase
the production of the high-value commodities in keeping with the changing
food consumption patterns. It would also contribute to some increase in the
level of farm productivity and create off-season employment, thus helping to
improve the balance between rural and urban incomes.



- 23 -
3.02      Over a period of four years, the project would continue to provide
credit, on a fully flexible basis, for the type of activities started during
the previous projects, namely: greenhouse, sprinkler irrigation, and on-farm
storage. It would also finance new activities such as chilled storage,
motorized spraying equipment, small-scale agro-processing, backyard beef
fattening, and improved marketing of fruits and vegetables. The project
activities would cover the whole country. Its design and scope are geared
to the present and future capability of NACF in general, and KC in
particular. The subprojects have been selected on the basis of the present
and projected requirements for investments in the concerned subsesctor
(paras. 1.15 to 1.20). But the actual mix of the subprojects would depend on
future demand for credit in these and other subsectors and may tlherefore
differ from the projections. Accordingly, the subproject mix assumed herein
is intended largely to illustrate the probable range of the aggregate
financial and economic rates of return, and not to circumscribe NACF with
regard to actual allocation for each of the subprojects.
C. Project Components
Greenhouses
3.03      The project would establish new metal greenhouses and replace
existing bamboo or wooden ones with metal greenhouses. The major items to
be financed would be metal frames, polythylene film covers, heat insulating
covers, small irrigation pumps and fittings, oil heaters, power sprayers,
and working capital for the first crop of vegetables. The average size of
the subprojects would be 300 pyeong (0.1 ha) while the investment cost,
including the working capital for the first year, would be W 5.82 million.
for new and W 3.37 million for replacement greenhouses.
Sprinkler Irrigation
3.04      This would consist of sprinkler irrigation facilities for
orchards, mostly apples, and vegetables in the upland areas. The main
investment items would be concrete-lined wells, pumping station czonsisting
of kerosene engine or electric motor, centrifugal pumps, pump andl engine
bases, sprinkler systems, and installation costs. The average cost per
subproject would be W 3.32 million for orchards and W 2.01 million for
vegetables.
On-farm Storage
3.05      This would consist of construction of storage principaLly for
apples, but also for oranges. The average floor area per subproject would be
about 20 pyeong (66 sq m) and the average cost would be about W 5.52 million.
The project would finance building materials, construction costs, and
fixtures.



- 24 -
Chilled Storage
3.06      This is intended mainly for apples and onions; other commodities
would include garlic, oranges, potatoes, and chestnuts. The majority of the
subprojects would have a floor area of 100 pyeong (330 sq m). The average
investment cost would be W 77.91 million. The major investment items would
be building materials, construction costs, refrigeration equipment and
related fittings and fixtures, and installation costs.
Speed Sprayers
3.07      The project would also finance speed sprayers for orchards.  The
cost is estimated at W 7.95 million per unit. Each unit would have a tank
capacity of 500 litres, spraying power of 27 psi, and would spray 0.75-1.0
ha/hr. Each would be used by a group of farmers.
Other Components
3.08      These would include sorting and grading machines for fruits;
fabrication of packing material for fruits and vegetables, small-scale
facilities for processing fruits (oranges) and dairy products, poultry and
small-scale piggery enterprises, and backyard cattle fattening, involving two
to three head of cattle per household, in cases where sufficient local feed-
stuff, such as roughage and crop residues, is available to ensure low-cost
production.
C. Cost Estimates
3.09      Detailed cost estimates are in Annex 3, and summarized in Table 3.1.
The total project cost is estimated at W 74,219 million (US$114.2 million) of
which W 32,526 million (US$50.0 million) or 43.8% is foreign exchange. Costs
are based on July 1, 1980 prices. No allowance has been made for
contingencies as it is expected that any cost increase would lead to an
adjustment in the number of subprojects.

D. Financing Plan
3.10      The proposed Bank loan of US$50 million would finance 100% of
foreign exchange costs. NACF would contribute US$29.9 million (26.2%), and
the beneficiaries US$34.3 million (30.0%). Table 3.2 summarizes the financing
plans. The proposed Bank loan would be made to the Government and on-lent
to NACF under a subsidiary loan agreement. NACF would raise its contribution
partly from its commercial banking resources and partly from the Special
Funds generated by the repayment of subloans under the previous Bank
supported projects./l The current loan would specify that the terms for
relending from the Special Funds would be identical to those applying to the
proceeds of the proposed loan. The actual mix of funds from these two
sources would be governed by the need to ensure a sufficient margins between
the weighted average cost of funds to NACF and Participating Cooperatives
/1  Under the previous two projects (Cr. 355-KO and Loan 1328-KO, Special
Funds were established in which repayments by subborrowers are being
deposited. The available revolving special fund is projected as
follows:                   1982    1983    1984    1985   Trotal

and the interest rate payable by the subborrowers, to meet the credit
administration costs of NACF and the participating cooperatives, at present
estimated to be 4% of loans granted (para. 4.14).

E. Procurement
Fruits and Vegetables Subprojects
3.11      Greenhouses and On-farm Storage.  These involve simple structures,
too widely scattered to attract international bidding or distantly located
domestic contractors. They would therefore be constructed by local
contractors and, in some cases, by the owners themselves.
3.12      Agro-processing, Packaging Material, and Chilled Storage.  These
would be too small for international bidding; however, many of the foreign
firms in the business of chilled storage equipment are locally represented
and would have the opportunity to promote sales. The construction,
machinery and equipment for the chilled storage, packaging material and
agro-processing subprojects would be procured through local competitive
bidding, advertised accordingly under procedures satisfactory to the Bank;
foreign contractors would be eligible to bid.
3.13       Sprinkler Irrigation.  There are many local suppliers of sprinkler
irrigation and prices are generally competitive; they would be procured
through prudent shopping by the subborrowers through normal commercial
sources.
3.14       Speed Sprayers.  Speed sprayers are also available through many
private channels.  Their procurement would be spread over several years and
scattered over too many buyers to make it worthwhile for external bidders.
Speed sprayers, too, would be obtained by prudent shopping through normal
commercial sources, but NACF would require that, in cases involving
cooperatives, the subborrowers obtain price quotations from at least three
suppliers.



- 27 -
F. Implementation Schedule and Disbursement
Implementation Schedule
3.15      The project's subloan commitment period would be four years
starting in July 1981. It is expected that the last commitment of funds
would take place in July 1985, and the project will be fully dis1bursed by
December 1985 (six months after the last commitment). Annex 4 shows the
estimated disbursement schedule as summarized below:
Year          Annual   Cumulative
FY                 US$ Mln -----  Percentage
1982            6.0         6.0         12.0
1983           10.0        16.0         32.0
1984           12.5        28.5.        57.0
1985           14.0        42.5         85.0
1986            7.5        50.0        100.0
Total        50.0        50.0        100.0
Disbursement
3.16      Because of the large number of small subloans anticipated under the
proposed project, disbursement of the Bank loan proceeds would be a uniform
63% of the amount of subloans made by cooperatives and NACF under the project.
Withdrawal application would be supported by Statements of Expenditures (SOE),
certified by NACF Project Manager. All other related supporting documents,
(including copies of contract documents, suppliers- invoices, evidence of
shipment and payment for agro-processing, packaging materials and chilled
storage subloans) would be retained in one central location and made available
for review on request by Bank staff during supervision missions., The SOE
would be audited by independent auditors (para. 4.18).
4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Organization, Management and Staffing
General
4.01      As in the previous two projects, NACF in general and :its Technical
Unit (TU) in particular would be responsible for the overall implementation of
the project. The TU was established under the first project. 'It is headed by
a Project Manager who is responsible to the General Manager of the Foreign.
Loan Department, who in turn reports to one of the NACF vice-presidents.



- 28 -
4.02      Under the First and the Second Project, the KC were wholly res-
ponsible for loan processing and disbursement, while TU-s principal respon-
sibilities included: (a) preparation of the annual lending program; (b)
supervision and monitoring of project progress; (c) provision cf technical
advice and training of the Loan Appraisal Officers (LAO-s) of the Kun
cooperatives in subproject appraisal and supervision; (d) arranging withdrawal
of project funds from GOK/Bank; and (e) preparing quarterly progress reports
for submission to the Bank. These arrangements have proved satisfactory and
would, therefore, be continued under the proposed project. However, there
would be three changes: KC will carry out lending functions as branches of
NACF; a selected number of the PC would participate (para. 4411); and,
because of their technical complexity, the TU would be directly responsible
for evaluating and supervising: packaging material, chilled storage, and
agro-processing (para. 4.13).
4.03      At present, the TU staff consists of a Manager, one Deputy Manager,
five senior and four junior technical staff. The proposed proiect includes
new and technically complex subprojects (processing, chilled storage and
packaging material) for which the TU has had no prior experience. The TU
would therefore be strengthened by: (a) the appointment of an Agricultural
Engineer to its staff; and (b) increased technical backing by NACF in-house
expertise. The agricultural engineer would be responsible mainly for
supervising the technical aspects of packaging material, agro-processing and
clhilled storage subprojects; he would also review the engineering aspects of
the sprinkler irrigation, and liaise with the various outside specialized
technical agencies. Assurances was obtained from the Borrower that NACF would
appoint, within six months following loan effectiveness, an agricultural
engineer, with qualification and experience acceptable to the Bank, and post
him to the TU (para. 7.01(a)).
4.04      The TU handles only about 5% of the total agricultu-ral term lend-
ing of NACF while the balance falls under other departments. Hitherto the
TU has been carrying out its various activities with little direct involvement
of these other departments. As a result, the institution strengthening
aspects of the previous projects have had little impact on these other depart-
ments that handle the preponderant part of NACF agricultural lending programs.
Partly to diffuse the institutional development impact within NACF, a
Project Implementation Committee (PIC), in which appropriate staff from the
other relevant departments would fully participate, would be established; this
would help to expose such staff especially to project appraisal techniques
which have been successfully used by the TU for Bank-supported activities.
The Committee membership would include representatives of the NACF-s Live-
stock, Horticulture, Agricultural Machinery, Community Development, Technical,
Special Cooperatives, Credit Planning, and Research divisions. The Committee
would be chaired by the Vice-President in charge of the Foreign Loan Depart-
ment, while the TU project manager would serve as the secretary.
4.05      The Committee would also be responsible for coordinating the project
activities with those of the NACF programs financed from local funds. In



- 29 -
addition, it would serve as the focal point through which the other depart-
ments of NACF would provide support to the TU (para. 4.03). The various
members of the ComDmittee would also serve as the principal professio-ial
liaison persons with their respective professional counterparts in MM, ORD,
ADC and other governmental agencies. This way, TU staff would be relieved of
being solely responsible for liaison with such agencies; the arrangement would
also ensure more effective liaison in that the Committee members would be in a
better position to communicate professionally with the technical staff of
these other agencies. An assurance was obtained from the Borrower that such a
committee would be established within six months following the project
effectiveness (para. 7.01(b)).
4.06      A Project Coordinating Committee (PCC) had been established under
the previous projects.  It comprised representatives of NACF, MAF, ORD, EPB,
Ministry of Finance and ADC. It however ceased functioning during the
second project mainly because the need for interministerial coordination was
sufficiently met through MAF. There is therefore no need to reactivate this
committee.
4.07      The cooperatives would themselves directly undertake some of the
subprojects, namely: the agro-processing, chilled storage and speed sprayer
subprojects. In the latter case, the cooperatives would achieve economies
of scale by owning speed sprayers and making them available to the farmers
under custom service.
4.08      The Agricultural and Fishery Development Corporation (AFDC) is the
agency primarily responsible for financing agro-processing and chilled storage
investments in Korea. A Bank loan of US$50 million for AFDC was approved in
April 1980. However, cooperatives cannot avail themselves of these fund as
they are legally prohibited from borrowing from any source other than NACF.
The proposed project would therefore provide loans to cooperatives for
agro-processing and chilled storage subprojects. To ensure that AFDC and
NACF would avoid over-investments and wasteful competition among their
borrowers as well as with existing enterprises, assurance was obtained from
the Borrower that NACF would confine its lending to cooperatives, and that
NACF and AFDC would keep each other sufficiently informed regarding their
lending proposals for these subprojects, and coordinate their lending
accordingly; and that in case of disagreement, either NACF, AFDC or both would
refer the matter to MAF for final ruling (para. 7.01(c)).
Field Extension Support
4.09      NACF relies mainly on the Office of Rural Development (ORD) of MAF
(paras. 1.28-1.29), but also on technical staff of its member cooperatives
(para. 2.07) to provide technical extension support to the farmer borrowers.
Mainly because of insufficient liaison between ORD and NACF, the required
specialized technical support from ORD has not been available in a number of
cases where it was much needed. The proposed committee (paras. 4.04 and 4.05)
would help to improve the liaison between NACF's TU and ORD through profes-
sional contact between the relevant committee members and the staff of ORD.

B. Lending Procedures, Terms and Conditions
Lending Procedures
4.10      The Government would make available the proceeds of the Bank loan
to NACF for onlending to participating cooperatives and NACF's direct subbor-
rowers. Assurance was obtained from the Borrower that the subborrower would
contribute at least 30% of the subproject costs, and that NACF would
contribute US$29.9 million equivalent (para. 3.10) towards the project partly
from the NACF commercial banking resources and partly from the funds generated
by the repayment of subloans under the previous Bank supported projects
(Credit 335-KO and Loan 1328-K0); (para. 7.01(d)). An assurance was also
obtained from the Borrower that the participating NACF branches would meet the
criteria set out in para. 7.01(e).
4.11       In the interest of strengthening the institutional building aspect
of the project, selected PC would participate in the project under close
supervision by NACF in general and KC in particular. It is expected that
their participation would be introduced mainly in 1982. Before involving any
PC, NACF would determine the criteria for selecting them, special procedures
to be adopted for lending by PC, and the allowed interest rate spread. An
assurance was obtained from the Borrower that prior to involvement of Primary
Cooperatives (PC), NACF would submit to the Bank, for its approval, details
regarding the proposed: criteria for selecting participating PC; special
lending procedures; and interest spread allowed to PC (para. 7.01(f)).
4.12      Until now, the LAO in the KC have been undertaking detailed
appraisal of each and every subloan. This is partly intended to aLfford the
LAO extensive opportunities to learn project appraisal techniques. While
these procedures have worked well, they necessitate substantial time to
appraise subloans, as it takes about three months to process a subloan.
With a view to maximizing the use of staff resources and since most of the
LAO have gained considerable experience in subloan appraisal, the TU would
simplify gradually the appraisal procedures. To this end, instead of a
case-by-case detailed analysis, the TU would develop representative farm
models for various categories of on-farm subprojects taking into account any
significant geographical variations in investment costs, production
costs, cropping pattern, prices and other relevant factors. However,
verification of collateral and creditworthiness would continue to be done on
a case-by-case basis.
4.13      Chilled storage, agro-processing, and packaging material are new
subprojects which were not included in the previous two projects. They also
require expertise, to evaluate loan applications and supervise the subloans,
that is not available among the participating cooperatives as NACF branches.
Because of this, appraisal of chilled storages, packaging materials, and
agro-processing subprojects would be undertaken by the TU. Furthermore,
assurance was obtained from the Borrower that prior to approving these loans,



- 31 -
NACF would submit to the Bank for review and approval the first five loan
applications for each of these subprojects (para. 7.01(g)).
Terms and Conditions
4.14       The interest rate payable by participating cooperatives to NACF
would be at least 13% and by the subborrowers at least 16% per annum. These
rates take into account the weighted average cost of Project funds to NACF and
Participating Cooperatives, plus a 1% margin to NACF and 3% margin to the
participating cooperatives to cover the project administration costs; they
also meet the conditions specified here below. However, the Government may,
from time to time and in consultation with the Bank, vary these minimum rates
of interest provided that:
(a) the rate payable by the subborrowers to NACF and participating
cooperatives would: (i) at least cover participating cooperatives
cost of project funds, as well as the participating cooperatives
cost of administering the project credit scheme; (ii) at least equal
to the rate payable for local funds for similar subprojects under
NACF-s auspices; and (iii) be positive in real terms over the
long-run; and
(b) the rate payable by participating cooperatives to NAC:F would at
least cover the weighted average cost of Bank and other projects
funds, as well as NACF's cost of administering the project credit
scheme.
To this end, the Borrower, in consultation with the Bank, would review from
time to time and at least once a year, the interest rate structure according-
ly. Assurance was obtained from the Borrower to this effect [para. 7.01(h)].
4.15       NACF and the Borrower would also enter into a Subsidiary Agreement
on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank; the execution of a
subsidiary agreement would be a condition of effectiveness. Assurance was
obtained from the Borrower to this effect (para 7.01 (i), and para 7.02).
4.16       The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk.  An assurance
was obtained from the Borrower that the Government would bear the foreign
exchange risk on the proceeds of the Bank loan (para. 7.01(j)).
Subloan Approval Powers
4.17       Under the previous projects, individual loans were relatively small,
generally below US$10,000 and there was therefore no need for NACF to seek
Bank approval. Under the proposed project, a few of the subloans may exceed
US$0.5 million. NACF would submit to the Bank for approval all loans
exceeding US$500,000 in investment cost. Assurance was be obtained from the
borrower that, all loans exceeding US$500,000 would be submitted to the
Bank for review and approval; the free limit would be reviewed by NACF and
the Bank at a mutually agreed time (para. 7.01(k)).



- 32 -
Loan Repayments
4.18      The repayment of each subloan would be determined according to the
projected cash flow but would allow rescheduling of bona fide cases. Cash
flow models for typical subloans indicate that loan repayments range from 5
years (including 1 year grace) for onfarm storage and sprinkler irrigation
for vegetables to 9 years (including 5 years of grace) for sprinkler irriga-
tion for orchards. The repayment period of the Bank loan by the Government
would be 15 years including 3 years grace. The repayment period of Bank loan
by NACF to the Government would be same.
C. Project Accounting
4.19      NACF's accounts are audited by independent auditors acceptable to
the Bank.  This would be continued under the proposed project and would be
expanded to include annual auditing of Statements of Expenditure and other
related documents submitted to the Bank in support of application for
reimbursement, with a view to ascertaining whether these documents and the
related internal control procedures are sound. NACF would also maintain
separate accounts for the project funds in a manner sufficient to show the
actual utilization of the project funds, and would forward to the Bank
within four months following the closing of the financial year audited
accounts including the audited balance sheets and income statements covering
its total operations. Assurance was obtained from the Borrower to this
effect (para. 7.01(1)).
D. Monitoring, Evaluation and Reporting
Monitoring and Evaluation
4.20      The TU's current monitoring system consists of monthly and bimonthly
reports from participating Kun cooperatives, and field visits by TU staff.
While the monitoring system has generally operated satisfactorily it does not
generate, in sufficient details and at appropriate intervals, the information
needed to assess realized benefits and costs relating to the subprojects and
to determine actual input-output technical coefficients. The system therefore
needs to be improved to generate such information. An assurance was obtained
from the Borrower to this effect (para. 7.01(m)).
Reporting
4.21      NACF sends quarterly progress reports to the Bank in the format
established during the First Project. These are satisfactory and would
continue under the project, but subject to review after two years. The scope
of the first quarterly report would be widened to include information on
NACF-s and Primary Cooperatives total lending operations. NACF would also
prepare a project completion report.



- 33 -
4.22      As noted above (para. 2.32) the NACF general information system
relating to its other non-Bank supported agricultural lending activities does
not generate sufficiently detailed data on several important aspects.  In the
interest of enhancing the overall operational efficiency of NACF, an assurance
was obtained from the Borrower that NACF would undertake the necessary
improvements within three years of effectiveness (para. 7.01(m)).
5. PRODUCTION, DEM4AND PRICES AND MARKETING
A. Production, Demand and Prices
5.01      Yields.  Yield assumptions are found in the notes to the models
detailed in Annex 6. Briefly, iron-framed greenhouses are expected to achieve
yields of 46.75 tons/ha of cucumbers and 43.5 tons/ha of green peppers by
the third crop year (new greenhouse farmers) or in the first crop year
(farmers converting from bamboo greenhouse). Bamboo framed structures are
assumed to produce 15% less. The above yields are on the conservative side
as they basically reflect the national averages; some farmers, for example
in Gyeongsam-nam Province, are able to obtain yields of 70 tons/ha of
cucumbers and over 40 tons/ha of green peppers. Sprinkler irrigation of
vegetables is assumed to increase yields by 20% over the 1975-79 national
averages (assumed to apply without sprinkler irrigation).  Sprinkler
irrigation of new dwarf apple orchards raises assumed yields by 17%.
5.02      Production and Demand.  At full development (1992) the incremental
output from the assumed subprojects mix (Annex 3, footnote (a)) is shown in
Table 5.1. No major problem is envisaged regarding the effect of project
production on prices. As Table 5.1, column 5 indicates, the project-s
incremental output would be small compared to total demand. Greenhouses
would produce vegetables in the season when there is no other source of
supply to meet the rapidly rising preferences for fresh vegetables.
Furthermore, greenhouses can produce a wide variety of vegetables and
sprinkler irrigation can be applied to fruits other than apples as well,
thus providing the flexbility to adjust production, particularly for
vegetables, in the event of unfavorable supply and demand conditions.
5.03      Prices.  As Table 5.2 shows, fruit and vegetable prices have been
rising sharply since 1975. This trend is expected to remain firm as a
result of population growth, per capita income increases and relatively high
income elasticities of demand for fruits and vegetables. The off-season
supply of vegetables from greenhouses and of fruits from on-farm and chilled
storage would tend to reduce the degree of seasonal price fluctuations.

B. Marketing
5.04      Agricultural products in Korea are marketed through private
traders and the NACF cooperative network. The cooperatives accounted for
about 21% of the total farm produce and 40% of fruits and vegetables
marketed in 1979. Marketing of the Project output of fruits and vegetables
would be channelled mostly through the Horticultural and Primary
Cooperatives, and private traders. Farmers produce for sale is usually
picked up at the farms by the Cooperatives and transported to the marketing
centers, and then sold on an individual consignment basis through auction
sales in urban marketing centers operated by NACF (including some by Kun and
Primary Cooperatives). The farmer is paid the auction price less commission
for marketing services rendered by NACF and the Cooperatives, and transport
costs. The commission is fixed by NACF; at present it is 6% of the auction
price. The majority of the farmers prefer to market their produce through
private traders, who pay on the site at harvest time and assume all subsequent
spoilage losses and other marketing risks.
5.05      However, there is a need to improve the marketing of fruits and
vegetables in the country, particularly with a view to reducing spoilage
and wastes, shortening the distribution channels, introducing grading,
standardization and better packaging methods, and enhancing competitive
price formation especially in the major urban wholesale markets. Most of
the central marketing facilities in such cities as Seoul are too congested
and outdated. The proposed project would help to improve the situation by
financing sorting equipment for fruits, better storage facilities, and
manufacturing of better packaging materials for both fruits and vegetables.
A marketing project to be supported by the Bank is under preparation; it is
expected to include a country-wide study of the fruits and vegetables
marketing system with the aim of identifying needed improvements and
formnulating a national master plan for implementing these improvements.
6. JUSTIFICATION, BENEFITS AND RISKS
A. Justification
6.01      The project would raise farm incomes, and address several sectoral
issues, by:
(i) increasing the supply of high-value products for which
demand is growing rapidly;
(ii)  increasing off-season employment mainly through greenhouse
subprojects; and                                          I
(iii)  reducing the peak-season labor shortage, among orchard farmers,
through speed sprayer subprojects.



- 36 -
6.02       The project would directly benefit, among others, about 6,500
vegetable producers, 7,300 orchard farmers, and 124 Cooperative sub-
borrowers. To these must be added the value of institutional development
expected from project activities in support of Kun and Primary cooperatives-
lending operations.
B. Financial Analysis
6.03      Annex 6, Table 8 shows the financial prices used in the analysis
while Tables 1 to 7 show detailed financial analysis. Table 9 shows the
aggregate net incremental benefits of the project. Table 6.1 summarizes the
financial rates of return of typical investments to be financed.

/a Gross income is cost savings.
6.04      The rates of return are satisfactory and range from 23% for
sprinkler irrigation of apples to 83% for on-farm apple storage.  The
aggregate financial rate of return would depend on the mix of subprojects as
determined by the farmers' wish to borrow project funds for the various
subprojects. Experience from the first and second projects indicates that



- 37 -
the mix may change in keeping with changing domestic and international
economic conditions. The mix here assumed is therefore essentially
illustrative; it gives an aggregate financial rate of return of 42%.
C. Economic Analysis
6.05      Detailed models using economic prices are found in the project
files, and rates of return and sensitivity test are summarized in Table 6.2.
Economic rates of return are quite similar to those derived from the
financial analysis, ranging from 24% for sprinkler irrigation of apples to
78% for on-farm storage. The aggregate rate of return is 41%.
6.06      Most economic prices were derived by applying Bank-generated
conversion factors to financial prices. For all outputs, the consumption
conversion factor of 0.87 was applied. This is rather conservative in the
case of apples (the only output with significant trade), so the apple
sprinkler irrigation rate may be understated. For farm labor, seasonal labor
surplus (many subprojects would use labor primarily in the off-season)
indicated a conversion factor of 0.82. Skilled labor was taken at its
financial price. A conversion factor of 0.91 was applied to most capital
goods (greenhouse investments, sprinkler irrigation capital goods, apple
storage and chilled storage investments, and power sprayers and their hoses).
The standard conversion factor of 0.89 was applied to certain costs having a
mixed capital-consumption-labor content, including biocides, maintenance and
repairs, and on-farm apple storage sterilization. Electricity was priced at
W 37.12 (US$0.064) per kWh, computed by the Bank as its marginal cost of
production. Fertilizers and fuels were entered at world prices adjusted for
transport, insurance and handling charges, except for compost, which was
priced at 90% of its financial value. Power tiller service was entered at 87%
of its financial value, since it represents costs of labor, capital and fuel.
Speed sprayer financial prices were adjusted by deducting taxes, commissions
and most custoins charges totaling W 2 million per machine. The opportunity
cost of capital was taken at 15%.
D. Risks
6.07      No major risks are anticipated.  As the sensitivity analysis demon-
strates all the subprojects are able to sustain a 10% reduction in revenues or
increase in costs and still give satisfactory rates of return; only new
greenhouse subprojects exhibit an unsatisfactory rate of return if both
revenues and costs respectively fall and rise by 10%. Nevertheless, the
returns for orchard sprinklers irrigation subprojects are known to be highly
sensitive to yield responses as determined by the moisture retention capacity
of the soil. Furthermore, the returns for speed sprayer subpro;jects
significantly depend on full utilization which may not be realized given the
small average size of individual orchards in Korea. The risk pertaining to



- 38 -
the sprinkler irrigation would be minimized by ensuring adequate technical
advisory services to the farmers, while the risk pertaining to the speed
sprayers would be minimized through group utilization under the cooperatives
or other groups.

7. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
A. Agreements Reached
Agreements Reached
7.01      Assurances were obtained from the borrower that:
(a) NACF would, within six months following loan effectiveness,
appoint an agricultural engineer with qualification and experience
acceptable to the Bank, and attach him to the TU (see para. 4.03);
(a) a Project Implementation Committee, in which appropriate NACF staff
from the various NACF departments, would be established within six
months following effectiveness of the project (para. 4.05);
(c) to avoid overinvestment in agro-processing and chilled storage,
NACF and AFDC would keep each other informed regarding their
respective lending proposals and ensure that there would be no
wasteful competition for raw materials among their borrowers and
existing agro-processing facilities; furthermore, NACF would
confine its lending to cooperatives. In case of disagreement, they
would refer the matter to MAPF for final ruling (para. 4.08);



- 39 -
(d) The subborrowers would contribute at least 30% of the subproject-s
costs and NACF would contribute an aggregate amount of US$29.9 mil-
lion (26.0% of each subloan) equivalent towards the project partly
from its commercial banking resources and partly from the special
fund generated by subloan repayment under Credit 335-Ko and
Loan 1328-KO (para. 4.10);
(e) the participating NACF branches would meet the following
criteria:
(i)  overdues would not exceed 10% of total outstanding loans
during the immediately preceding year;
(ii) at least one LAO would work full time on project loans, with
the number of LAOs being increased commensurate with
appraisal work load;
(iii)  adequate extension services would be made available to the
farmers (para. 4.10);
(f)  prior to involving Primary Cooperatives in project lending, NACF
would submit for Bank approval criteria for selecting the
participating Primary Cooperatives, interest rate spread allowed
for these cooperatives, and envisaged lending procedures
(para. 4.11);
(g) NACF would forward to the Bank for review and approval at least
the first five subprojects for packaging materials,
agro-processing and chilled storage before it approves any loan
application for these subprojects (para. 4.13);
(h) the interest rate payable by the subborrowers would be at least
16.0% and interest rate payable by participating cooperatives at
least 13.0% per annum. The Government may, from time to time and
in consultation with the Bank and NACF, vary these minimum rates of
interest provided that the interest rate structure ensures that:
(i) the rate payable by the subborrowers to NACF and
participating cooperatives would:
-  at least cover participating cdoperatives  cost of
project funds, as well as the participating coopera-
tives- cost of administering the project credit scheme
which is at present estimated at 4v of project loans
granted;
- at least equal the rate payable for local funds for
similar subprojects implemented under NACF-s auspices;
and



- 40 -
- be positive in real terms over the long-run;
(ii) the rate payable by the participating cooperatives to NACF
would at least cover the weighted average cost of Bank and
other project's funds, as well as NACF-s cost of
administering the project credit scheme which is at present
estimated at 1% of project loans granted;
To this end and in consultation with the Bank and NACF, the Borrower
would accordingly review the above interest rate structure from time
to time and at least once a year (para. 4.14);
(i) NACF and the Borrower would enter into a Subsidiary Agreement on
terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank (para. 4.15).
(j) the Government would bear foreign exchange risk relating to
proceeds of the Bank loan under the project (para. 4.16);
(k) prior to approval by NACF all subloans exceeding US$500,000 would be
submitted to the Bank for review and approval; the free limit will
be reviewed NACF and the Bank as may be warranted (para. 4.17);
(1) NACF would have its accounts, statement of expenditure and other
related documents used to support application for reimbursement
from the Bank, audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank; maintain separate accounts for the project funds in a manner
sufficient to indicate the uses of the project funds; and forward
the Bank within four months following the closing of the financial
year audited accounts including balance sheet and income statement
for NACF total operations (para. 4.19);
(m)  NACF would design, during the first year of the project effective-
ness, a monitoring and evaluation system that would generate, in
sufficient details and at suitable intervals, data relating to,
inter alia, costs and benefits and actual input-output technical
coefficients (para. 4.20); and
(n) NACF would, within three years of project effectiveness, take
the necessary action to improve its information system relating to
its non-Bank supported agricultural lending activities so as to
provide sufficiently detailed and systematic data regarding, inter
alia: purpose of loans, disbursements, amount due and arrears,
maturity structure, and consolidated lending for cooperatives as
a whole (para. 4.22).



- 41 -
B. Conditions of Effectiveness
7.02      The following shall be the conditions of effectiveness:
(a) Execution of a Subsidiary Agreement between NACF and the
Borrower on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
C. Recommendations
7.03      In view of the above assurances, the proposed project is suitable
for a Bank loan of US$ 50 million.

lb  Represents amount due in respect of monopoly purchase/sale of fertilizers
entrusted to NACF, purchase/sale of pesticides, interest subsidy due under
government sponsored loaning programmes, exchange losses and deposits with
or loans due from government departments. Pending repayment of GOK dues,
BOK has established a special line of credit in favor of NACF (W 240 bil
lion), which has been fully drawn. The concessional rate of interest (5%
p.a.) on this loan is also borne by GOK.
/c  Retained earnings of W 42.4 billion included an amount of W 37.1 billion
in respect of certain insurance reserves. These amounts according to
insurance regulations, do not represent profits of NACF and therefore cani-
not be adjusted against losses of NACF in other departments or paid as
dividends to NACF stockholders. Both NACF and auditors would review the
position and commencing from FY80, reclassify the amounts as outside
liabilities.

commencing FY1980.

/a  Except in the case of apples, production is assumed to equal domestic
demand. In bad years Korea must import some fruits and vegetables, but
often it is a small net exporter.
/b Greenhouse production was 35% of the 1978 total.
/c Greenhouse production was 7% of the 1978 total.
/d The 1979 production is used instead of the 1978 figure because 1978 pro-
duction was unusually low (38% of the production suggested by the 1971-79
trend line), while 1979 was near normal (97% of the trend line figure).
/e Exports in 1978 were 1,873 tons, but are not included here because export
projections are particulary unreliable. Export demand is assumed to have
no influence on domestic demand.

/a Based on 1966-78 time series data; cross-section and other time series
produce quite different elasticities in some cases.
Projection Formula
Dt = (1+ng)t-0 (1+p)t-0, where Dt is demand t
years after 1978, Do is demand in the base year, n is income elasticity,
g is per capita income growth rate, and p is population growth rate.
Because the coefficients n,g and p change with t, three separate formulae
are used:
For 1981:  D3 = Do (1+D.055n)(1.016)(1-0.011)(1.016)(1+0.054n)(1.0155)
For 1986 and 1988: Dt = D3(1+0.0545n)t-3(1.0155)t- , where t=8 and 10
respectively.
For 1992:  D14 =B0 (1+0.055n)4(l.015)4

/a  Prices and yields for the improved greenhouse are the same as those in the New Greenhouse model; with no improvements, the lower
bamboo-framed greenhouse produces vegetables worth 15% less.
/b  Frame residual value 33% at end of year 10.
7W?  Iron pipe and plastic feeders augment existing pump station; pump, feeders and pipes replaced year 6, and 50% residual value of
pup credited in year 10.
/d  Same as new greenhouse oil stove, but emisting stove replaced in year 3; year 10 residual value of second replacement stove 40%.
7;  Same as new greenhouse covers.
77  Same as new greenhouse sprayer, but existing sprayer replaced in year 3; year 10 residual value 25%.
E Same as new greenhouse operating costs.
Fuel cost 10% higher than with project because synthetic fiber covers insulate more efficiently.
77  Labor costs 10% higher than with project because working conditions are more difficult.
7 One-third of frame materials initial cost (W 581,000) replaced yearly.
One-third of straw blanket insulation covers initial cost (W 600,000) replaced yearly.
77 Seed, seed pot, seed bed soil, heating material, supports, fertilizer, pesticide, polyethylese film, etc.
