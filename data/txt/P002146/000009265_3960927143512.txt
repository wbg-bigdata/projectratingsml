On September 26, 1986, Nigeria adopted a flexible exchange rate policy and
introduced a Second-tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM) comprising an auction
and interbank market. On July 2, 1987, SFEM and the official (i.e., first-
tier) rates were merged.   On January 9, 1989, Nigeria moved from the
fortnightly auction system to direct daily sales of official sources of
foreign exchange to the banks, and the exchange rate is now established in
the interbank market. The exchange rate on January 9, 1989 was US$l - 16.87.
A rate of US$1 - N6.90 has been used for project analysis.

MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC POWER AUTHORITY
WITH THE WUARANTEE OF THE
FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF NIGERIA
FOR A POWER SYSTEM MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the National Electric Power Authority (NEPA) with the guarantee of the
Federal Republic of Nigeria for US$70 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would be on standard Bank terms with 20 years
maturity, including a five-year grace period, at the variable lending rate
1982.
2.        Backxround.  Nigeria's public electricity supply serves only
about 16? of the population. Until 1982, NEPA was hard pressed to build
facilities fast enough to meet high load growth resulting from oil boom
conditions. Nigeria's electricity supply started to deteriorate in 1982
primarily due to the economic downturn and the consequent limited access of
NEPA to foreign exchange for vital spare parts and services for the
maintenance and rehabilitation of the power system. Frequent system
collapses and load shedding became common. In September 1988, only 39 of
NEPA's 65 installed generating units were functioning. As a consequence of
the unreliable electricity supply, substantial high cost, captive generat-
ing capacity has been established in the country. Meanwhile, NEPA's
finances continued to deteriorate and reached crisis levels due to its.
inability to generate and sell much electricity, totally inadequate tariff
rates--about one-sixth of the long-run marginal cost and unchanged since
1979--the very high levels of technical and non-technical losses of
electricity (35?), serious weaknesses in the billing and collection system,
and the debt service burden. An ambitious recovery plan for NEPA was
prepared under a Power System Improvement Project (Power VII), appraised in
May 1987, which did not proceed due to the lack of action on electricity
tariffs and the commercialization of NEPA. Due to its continued inability
to pay bills, NEPA has been unable to obtain critical spare parts and
services required for even routine plant maintenance, seriously
exacerbating the supply difficulties. This has led to the reformulation of
the Bank's assistance under the proposed project focussing on urgent
rehabilitation and maintenance, and on institutional strengthening of NEPA.
As part of the Government's recent decision to commercialize NEPA's
operations, electricity tariffs were raised effective June 1, 1989 by
almost 300? from an average of 7 kobos/kWh to about 27.5 kobos/kWh.
3.        The Bank has made to date six loans for power projects.  While
the Bank's involvement in the sector has been generally successful in terms
of the physical development of the power system, it has been less than
satisfactory in the context of institutional development. Lessons learned
from these projects ave been taken into account in designing the proposed
project.
4.        Rationale for Bank Involvement.  The provision of adequate and
reliable power supply is essential to the recovery of the Nigerian economy
and, in particular, the industrial sector. The Bank's long-term strategy
is to assist the Government in defining a clear power sector strategy and



- 2-
in effectively implementing the necessary reforms including commercializa-
tion of NEPA, improving operational off'ciency and rationalizing investment
priorities, financing NEPA's investment program, and securing cofinancing.
A targeted Bank intervention is, however, necessary at this time to (a)
enable NEPA to meet the needs of its consumers and make the requisite
contribution to the nation's recovery through reliable power supply; and
(b) assist in the longer term process of rationalizing the power sector and
improving its efficiency. The proposed project is thus an attempt to
address the sector's most immediate and urgent problems. Once NEPA is on
the way to recovery and to a much improved service to its customers, it
would be possible to implement a comprehensive program to support NEPA's
long-term investment program and recovery efforts.
5.        Proiect Ob1ectives.  The project would (a) assist NEPA in
carrying out much-delayed maintenance and rehabilitation of selected
generation, transmission and distribution facilities, so as to improve the
supply of power in the near terms and (b) help establish institutional
strengthening of NEPA and provide the basis for a commercially viable
entity, capable of delivering a reliable and economic supply of electricity
to its customers.
6.        Proiect Description.  The project includest  (a) a maintenance
and rehabilitation component--rehabilitation of seven generation units
currently inoperable (606 MW) and major overhauls of ten units (850 KW),
running spares and consumables; technical services for operations, main-
tenance and training (generation improvements); improvements in the
transmission system to help diminish system faults and interruptions;
strengthening of the distribution system in selected priority areas to
overcome present weaknesses; metering equipment; and vehicles. The
component also includes engineering services for the supervision and
monitoring of the conversion of the Egbin thermal power plant to gas;
(b) institutional strengthening component--technical assistance by a mature
electric utility partner over the medium-term in all areas of NEPA's
operations (technical, financial, managerial and administrative matters).
The utility partner would provide technical services for the overall
strengthening of NEPA, assist it in the commercialization of its operations
(e.g., upgrading of the billing and collection system, reduction in
accounts receivable and system losses, financial management, effective
management information system, data processing, manpower planning, main-
tenance management, inventory control, etc.), and provide a range of
technical and training support services; installation of improved data
processing including the provision of personal computers and software to
improve billing, materials management, accounting procedures and management
information systems; and training services; Cc) a proiect management
assistance component to provide engineering services for project implemen-
tation and management; and (d) a studies and future groiect DreRaration
component to provide consultancy services for the updating of available
studies to prepare a revised least-cost priority investment program taking
into account recent developments, and for the preparation of feasibility
and other studies for developing future investment projects for external
financing.

7.        The total cost of the proje_-t is estimated at US$154.6 million
equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of US$108.1 million
(702). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule
A. Amounts and methods of procurement and disbursements, and the disburse-
ment schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project process-
ing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Nigeria are given in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff
Appraisal Report, No. 7607-UNI dated July 28, 1989, is also attached.
8.        Agreed Actions.  Agreements have been obtained on the following:
(a) revaluation of 1988 assets by December 31, 1989, and annual revaluation
thereafter; (b) NEPA to take all measures including an increase in
electricity tariffs by January 31, 1990 which will enable it to finance in
1990 from internal funds at least 302 of its annual investment program; (c)
principles for annual tariff increases beginning in 1991 to enable NEPA (i)
to earn at least 62 rate of return on revalued net fixed assets in 1991, 7Z
in 1992 and 82 in 1993 and thereafter; and (ii) to continue to generate
internally adequate funds in each year to finance at least 302 of its
annual investment program; (d) introduction of a fuel adjustment clause in
NEPA's tariff structure beginning January 1. 1990; (e) NEPA to maintain in
each year beginning in 1991, a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5,
and not to incur any debt unless the projected debt service coverage ratio
is at least 1.5, and its debt/equity ratio is less than 40:60; (f)
appropriate measures for timely payments (within sixty days) of future
electricity bills by all customers including the Government and its
agencies beginning July 1. 1989; (g) the Government to provide to NEPA
necessary funds in a timely manner in 1989 and 1990 to help meet NEPA's
debt service obligations and finance a part of NEPA's investment program;
Ch) NEPA's commercialization plan including a performance contract, and
annual reviews of performance; (i) improvements in revenue collection and
accounts receivable, and writing off of bad debt deemed uncollectible; (j)
reduction of system losses; (k) preparation, by June 30, 1990, of a
comprehensive maintenance strategy and plans for the power system, and
implementation thereafter; (1) preparation, by June 30, 1990, of a manpower
development study and implementation of findings in a phased manner by
December 31, 1991; (m) reviews every year on NEPA's rolling investment
program for the next five years; (n) preparation by NEPA and refiews with
the Bank each year beginning in 1989 on NEPA's financial plans in the form
of projected financial statements for the next five years, and NEPA to take
timely measures to maintain financial viability; and to) NEPA to furnish to
the Bank its annual audited accounts and the long-form report within six
months of the close of the fiscal year; the audited accounts for 1988 will,
however, be submitted by December 31, 1989.
9.        Understandings have also been reached with (a) the Government and
NEPA on the main elements of the commercialization of NEPA to ensure that
NEPA will become self-reliant, have more autonomy and be accountable for
its performance; (b) NEPA to develop, prior to purchasing personal
computers and software, an action program and requirements for improved
billing and collection procedures and accounting, the overall management
information system and a data processing plan; tc) NEPA on a review of its
insurance practices by March 31, 1990 and the implementation of findings
soon thereafter; (d) NEPA to prepare by October 31, 1989 for an exchange of
views with the Bank its financial plans for 1990 in the form of projected
financial statements; and (e) NEPA to use standard bidding documents for
procurement under the Bank loan.

10.       Conditions of loan effectiveness are:  (a) conversion by the
Government of all naira debt including short-term loans owed by NEPA as of
December 31, 1988, into equity and/or long-term loanss (b) employment of an
utility partner for technical assistance to NEPA in various areas of its
oper.ctions according to terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank; and
(C) tne effectiveness of cofinancing from the Federal Republic of Germany
(commodity aid and the KfW loan), and the ODA grant (UK) for the utility
assistance program.
11.       Benefits.  The proposed project will (a) help improve the
efficiency, availability and reliability of power supply in the country;
and (b) help relieve power shortages and reduce the high cost of private
autogeneration. The project will also contribute substantially towards
institution building to improve the efficiency and management of NEPA, and
help establish it as a commercially viable utility. T7.e proposed project
is a part of NEPA's medium-term development program (1989-93) required to
achieve the above objectives. The economic rate of return of the
development program is estimated at 18.42.
12.       Risks.  There are no unusual risks associated with the project.
The risk of possible delays in project implementation has been minimized
through the establishment of a Project Implementation Coordination Team in
NEPA, and the provision of specialists to assist in project management. In
view of the rehabilitation nature of the project, there is the possibility
that project costs may exceed the estimates. However, the project design
is such that should this occur, the scope of the work may be decreased to
accommodate the funds available with little detrimental effect upon the
completed portion. As for the risk related to the achievement/sustainab-
ility of institutional improvements, the Government is fully committed to
strengthening the power sector, and recent changes in the attitude towards
the importance of reliable and efficient power supply and management of
NEPA and parastatals in general should ensure political support for the
process. The prospects of new actions to improve the performance of NEPA
are, therefore, now brighter than before. The presence of strong technical
assistance through the utility assistance program should also minimize this
risk. Finally, annual reviews of NEPA's achievements would provide a
framework to ensure satisfactory implementation of the institutional
aspects of the proposed project.
13.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
