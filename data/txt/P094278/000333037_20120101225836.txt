1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design


1.1 Context at Appraisal

1.         Country and Sector Background: Since the country’s independence in 1960,
Mauritania had undergone important transformations and from a traditionally nomadic society of
the past it became a country characterized by a higher pace of urbanization. Of the 2.7 million
inhabitants, some 1.8 million lived in urban centers, including 600,000 in Nouakchott, the capital
city. However, of the vast surface of the country (1,03 million sq. km) over 80% of the land is
desert (only the southern areas of the country support rain-fed vegetation). The very low density
of the population living in rural areas (on an average there are 2.4 inhabitants per sq. km),
incomplete road and communication systems and poverty generated important problems and
impact on the health and nutrition status and the performance of the health delivery system.
About 46 percent of the population lived below the poverty line, only 37 percent of the
population had access to safe water and 77 percent to health services. With an annual gross
national income per capita of only US$430, Mauritania remains one of the poorest countries in
Africa.

2.     Most health status indicators in Mauritania had improved during the last decade and
compared favorably with Sub-Saharan Africa countries. However, there was a need to further
improve the sector’s performance. Main health and nutrition sector issues were as follows:
       • Insufficient and inequitable access, problems with affordability and utilization of
           health and nutrition services. Even as access to health services had increased, 23
           percent of the population had to travel more than five kilometers to reach a health
           center or a health post, and 10 percent had to travel more than ten kilometers to reach
           the nearest health facility.
       • Inadequate financing and inequitable resource allocation. The funding of the health
           and nutrition sectors remained low compared to the cost of reasonably good service
           provision and made the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
           questionable. Resource allocation to regions and facilities was not linked to
           performance nor did it pay sufficient attention to the needs of the poorest regions.
       • Shortages of skilled of health care providers and low motivation. Shortages of
           qualified and motivated health and social workers along with imbalances in the skill-
           mix and uneven geographical deployment remained among the key factors affecting
           the quality and utilization of services provided by the public sector. Ineffective
           management, training and supervision exacerbated the lack of responsiveness of the
           system to the health needs of the population.
       • Inadequate drug quality and supply: Drug shortages continued to persist in health
           facilities and the capacity of the drug procurement and distribution system needed
           further strengthening. In addition, there were problems with drug quality, which
           affected both the public and the many private pharmacies of the country.
       • Insufficient institutional capacity. The Ministry of Health and Social Affairs
           (MOHSA) was not adequately staffed and equipped to provide efficient stewardship
           for the implementation of the Health Sector Development Plan and to carry out its
           day to day management functions. Similarly, the State Secretariat for the Promotion
           of Women (SECF) was not sufficiently decentralized. In addition, the SECF capacity
           to develop nutrition policies, implement nutrition interventions and deliver services
           was inadequate. Program execution in the sector was slowed down by the rapid turn

                                                1
            over of staff holding key positions and by weaknesses in financial management and
            procurement. Further, coordination between MOHSA and SECF, which shared the
            mandate for malnutrition prevention and reduction, had been problematic over the
            past years.
        •   Poor management of health and nutrition service provision. Increased resource
            allocations had not translated into increased performance of many of the priority
            health programs or interventions (such as tuberculosis, malaria, reproductive health,
            infectious disease control, maternal and child health and nutrition) because of weak
            management, poor intersectoral collaboration (in matters such as water, sanitation,
            nutrition), insufficient community participation and lack of emphasis on demand
            creation for preventive services.
        •   Inadequate commitment to nutrition: At the highest political levels, progress had
            been made in raising the awareness of nutrition as a development issue, witness the
            development of a national nutrition policy and the acceleration of nutrition
            interventions over the last five years. However, nutrition was still not seen as a cause
            of poverty and an obstacle to economic development, nutrition programs still had
            very low coverage.

3.       Rationale for Bank assistance: The main objective of the Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) for FY03-05 was to support the Government in the implementation of its poverty
reduction strategy. The third CAS pillar was particularly relevant to the health and nutrition
sectors: the development of human resources and the expansion of the access to basic
infrastructure and services. The Health and Nutrition Support Project (HNSP) was consistent with
all the objectives of the CAS, and especially relevant to human resource development, increased
access of the poor to basic services, and institutional development based on good governance.

4.      The HNSP was fully consistent with the health and nutrition needs of the population of
the country as it would support the implementation of the National Health and Social Action
Policy 2005- 2015 (NHSAP), and the National Nutrition Development Policy 2005-2010
(NNDP). The Bank’s assistance to the country remained, therefore, essential to foster progress in
the health and nutrition sectors and sustain efforts to provide equitable services to the under-
served.


1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

5.       The HNSP’s overall objective was to strengthen the health system and its capacity to
improve the health and nutrition status of the population, notably of women, children, and the
poor, as it would support the implementation of the Government Program for the health and
nutrition sectors during the period 2006-2008.

6.      HNSP’s specific objectives were:
        • improve access to basic health services in underserved areas
        • improve the equitable allocation of resources to underserved areas
        • strengthen the health sector management to raise efficiency
        • enhance and expand community-based communications for improved nutrition.

7.      Key Indicators were:
        • Infant mortality rate (total and by region)
        • Under-5 mortality rate (total and by region)

                                                2
        •   Maternal mortality rate (total and by region)
        •   Contraceptive (modern methods)

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

8.      The objectives were not revised.

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

9.      The beneficiaries of the project included:

        • Women, children, and the poor who would benefit from the project in terms of
           improved health and nutrition.
        • People living in underserved areas in Mauritania, who would benefit from improved
           access to basic health services.
        • Directorate of Human Resources which would benefit through strengthened human and
           material capacities.
        • Health sector management which would enhance its coordination of the planning and
           budgeting, and increase budget execution.

1.5 Original Components (as approved)

10.     The project consisted of five components as follows:

Component 1: Develop human resources and improve their geographical distribution
(US$2.0 million).

11.     The project would support activities to: (i) strengthen the sector capacity to manage
human resources; (ii) improve inter and intra-sectoral coordination for better management of
human resources; and (iii) improve management and content of training programs, including
formative supervision. It consisted of:

        •   Professionalizing the Directorate of Human Resources at all levels.
        •   Improving coordinating mechanisms for improved human resources management:
        •   Improving the management and content of pre-services and in-service training, and
            on-the-job training.

Component 2: Ensure adequate sector financing and equitable allocation of resources for
the poor and for underserved geographical areas (US$1.5 million).

12.       The project would support activities (i) to improve the existing process and methods for
mobilizing the different sources of sector financing and for allocating them more equitably; and
(ii) to strengthen measures to ensure financial accessibility to health services, increase utilization
of services by the poorest and most vulnerable, and to rationalize the existing cost recovery
system.


                                                  3
Component 3. Improve health sector management to raise efficiency (US$l.0 million).

13.       This component would finance activities: (i) to promote the sector-wide approach; and
(ii) to develop the management capacity of health sector personnel at all levels.

Component 4. Improve the accessibility to quality and affordable health services in
underserved areas (US$3.5 million).

14.       This component included activities to (i) improve access to and quality of basic health
services, through the construction of approximately 13 health posts and 1 health center in areas of
low accessibility to public or private health services and rehabilitation of selected primary health
facilities. (ii) raising demand for services the strengthening of outreach activities from health
posts, and the revival of the community approach in order to the improved access to preventive
child, maternal and nutrition interventions for the population in hard-to- reach areas; and (ii) the
improvement of the availability of drugs, and (iii) Strengthening of the monitoring and evaluation
of the quality of the services provided through the enhancement of the integrated formative
supervision, and the revitalization of the monitoring system of the primary health care facilities.

Component 5. Enhance and expand community-based communications for improved
nutrition (US$2.0 million).

15.     This component would finance activities to: (i) develop and implement a community-
based nutrition communication strategy, (ii) improve access to basic essential health and nutrition
services; (iii) support the application of the salt iodization law in close collaboration with
UNICEF; and (iv) strengthen the capacity of the SECF to plan, monitor and evaluate nutrition
communication program implementation.

1.6 Revised Components

The components were not revised.

1.7 Other significant changes

16.     There was no change in the project design, scope and scale, and implementing
arrangements during implementation. However, the closing date of the project was extended
once by 18 months from December 31, 2009 to June 30, 2011 because at the time of resumption
of Bank operations in Mauritania in September 2009, only three months were available before the
project’s closing date. So the Government and the Bank agreed to extend the closing date to
enable the project to complete its activities.


2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

17.     Project Background. The Government’s Program for the health and nutrition sectors
was clearly stated in the NHSAP and the NNDP. These policies, both developed through broad
participatory processes, had a strong poverty focus and aimed at accelerating the achievement of:


                                                 4
(i) more demanding health and nutrition outcomes, (ii) sector reform objectives and, ultimately,
(iii)
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and MDGs targets by the year 2015. The HNSP would
provide support to the implementation of these far-reaching policies and targets.

18.      The HNSP was a follow-on operation to the previous Health Sector Investment Project
and the Nutricom Project and it was financed through a Specific Investment Loan (SIL). The
operation utilized a sector-wide approach similar to the one applied successfully during the
implementation of the Health Sector Investment Project but with a broader scope, as the HNSP
supported not only the MOHSA policy for the health sector but also the SECF policy for
nutrition.

19.      Soundness of background analysis. As part of project preparation, sector background
was studied, main sector issues were analyzed in depth, and government strategies to deal with
these issues were also considered. The project design took into account the sector issues as well
as government strategies. For example, the Bank took the lead in public expenditure analysis and
capacity building and also played a leading role in donor coordination and its role as last resort
lender was well appreciated. As a result of successful donor coordination work, a Memorandum
of Understanding (MOU) was signed and a “Partner Group for the Development of Health, Social
Action and Nutrition Sectors? was created.

20.      Assessment of project design: The project included the following features which were
relevant from a social perspective: (i) support to further develop health facilities in the
geographical zones with low accessibility to public or private services; (ii) set of activities aiming
at improving the affordability of services, which includes, among others, the review of prevailing
cost recovery arrangements and the support to the expansion of cost-recovery arrangements with
proven mechanisms to maintain or improve service affordability; (iii) support to a more equitable
distribution of resources (financial, human resources, services, drugs and vaccines) to regions and
beyond, which would also take into account poverty and accessibility criteria; (iv) reliance on
strategies of a clear benefit to the underserved such as preventive care and primary health care
development, community based interventions in nutrition, demand raising with focus on remote
under-served populations, improvement of health and nutrition providers’ behavior in regard to
women, children and the poor, and motivating them to discharge preventive services; and (v)
support to human resources development policy thrusts promoting a better geographical
distribution of providers and the development of a reward and incentive system for work in poor
and remote areas. In addition, a number of alternatives were considered in arriving at the chosen
design.

21.      On the other hand, the project also had some major drawbacks: (i) the design was
complex and over ambitious, with too many activities incorporated under five components.
Considering the country’s low absorptive capacity, many of its activities should have been
avoided and the project design be made more simple and realistic. Adequate planning and sound
preparation should have prioritized feasible interventions while taking into full consideration the
ability to execute; (ii) PDO lacked clarity; and (iii) PDO’s specific objectives and indicators were
misaligned. Instead, a better results-chain and logical framework should have been developed for
the selected interventions. Given the complexity of the project and the number activities, the
project time-frame should have been longer than three years. Further, sufficient time should have
been provided to carefully conceptualize the project and to analyze the sector situation in order to
prepare the project based on prioritized feasible interventions and taking into full consideration
the capacity to execute the project.


                                                  5
22.     Lessons of earlier operations taken into account. Lessons learned from other projects,
notably in Mauritania, and reflected into HNSP design included:


        •   Project Management. For strengthening the capacity of an implementing agency, it is
            important to absorb the PMU staff as part of the civil service at the end of the
            project.
        •   Monitoring and evaluation indicators. Agreeing on a set of monitoring and
            evaluation indicators does not suffice, if at mid-term and at project closing
            comparable and reliable information cannot be made available.
        •   Cost Recovery provides much needed additional resources to the facility that raised
            the money but, in a poor country such Mauritania, could (i) deter the poor from trying
            to seek care and (ii) constitute a disincentive for the health providers to dispense
            preventive services (which generally remain free of charge).
        •   Role of Women. The successful collaboration with the SECF in Nutricom
            demonstrated once more that women play a major role in health status improvement
            and in economic growth.
        •   Community Involvement. Community involvement of a major success-factor in many
            operations and this was also demonstrated throughout several projects and, in
            Mauritania, very specifically through the Health Sector Investment and Nutricom
            Projects.
        •   A sector-wide approach, when feasible, has considerable advantages over a
            traditional investment project.

23.     Risk Assessment. The Project Appraisal Document (PAD) had identified several
potential risks and mitigation measures as deemed appropriate at that time were spelt out. The
overall risk of the project was rated as Modest in the PAD. However, during implementation
some of the potential risks materialized. In hind sight it is obvious that the mitigation measures
were not adequate enough to deal with the risks. For example, the mitigating measures for
dealing with political instability were not sufficient and effective to deal with this problem. The
Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICRR) team is of the opinion that the overall
risk should have been rated as Significant.

24.     Adequacy of participatory processes. The identification and preparation of the HNSP
was the result of intensive discussions with all key bilateral and multilateral donors and UN
technical agencies. All those partners had endorsed and welcomed this process and had pledged
to focus their interventions to maximize their contribution to the achievement of the objectives of
the health and nutrition policies and Medium-Term Expenditures Framework (MTEF).

25.     Adequacy of government commitment. At the time of project preparation, the
government had demonstrated a high level of commitment to the objectives of the project. For
example, the MOHSA had demonstrated its interest and leadership. The MOHSA decided on a
Donors Coordination leader who assisted the Government in the coordination of donor
assistance programs and activities. The partner group supported and advised the MOHSA and the
SECF during the preparation of the national health and nutrition policies, including in the
deepening of the analysis on core bottlenecks, in carrying out a detailed institutional and
organizational capacity analysis at all levels of the health sector, and in elaborating the MTEF.




                                                6
2.2 Implementation

26.     The Bank conducted a Midterm Review (MTR) in March 2008, and assessed progress to
date on all project components, the implementation issues, and the actions to be taken to ensure
the successful completion of the project.

27.     Project Restructuring. The task team proposed an in-depth restructuring of the project at
the time of MTR in 2008. The main reasons for the intended restructuring the project were:

        •   The non-alignment between the development objectives, key indicators and
            components;
        •   The very low disbursement of Components 1 and 2 (6 and 3% respectively);
        •   Lack of coordination between the components;•
        •   Lack of integrated planning;
        •   The weaknesses of the health information system, monitoring and evaluation and
            management of human resources;

28.     The restructuring aimed to reformulate the overall and specific objectives, put some
concrete indicators with clear targets, and revise the project components. The opportunity was
also envisioned to use to streamline the design and further strengthen the project on service
delivery.

29.      The Bank had finalized the restructuring document and was ready to present it for Board
presentation. However because of the coup in August 2008, restructuring process was put on hold,
and the project implementation was suspended. Soon after the resumption of Bank activities in
September 2009, the task team had planned to reinitiate restructuring of the project. Accordingly,
the Bank suggested the government to submit the formal request for restructuring, but the
submission of the government request was delayed due to its non-compliance with financial audit.
By the time the Bank received the government request for restructuring, as the project was about
to close, the Bank decided not to proceed with restructuring.

The following factors had affected the project implementation:

Positive

30.     The conversion of the SECF into the Ministry of Social Affairs, Children, and Families
(MSACF) in 2007 was a positive development as it provided a better institutional anchorage for
the implementation of the nutrition component of the project.

Negative

31.    The project had to face several challenges during the implementation period, as shown
below:

        (i) Although the MOHSA had been previously in charge of a Bank financed project
        implementation, most Directors, and especially the DAF, were new and inexperienced in
        project implementation and this factor contributed to slow start in implementation.

        (ii) Political instability which prevailed in the country during the life of the project
        created a difficult environment for implementation. For example, during four and half


                                               7
        years of the project, there were two coup d’ etats, (the first one on August 3, 2005, and
        the other on August 6, 2008); the Prime Minister changed four times, the Minister of
        Health had changed eight times, and the Director of Directorate of Financial Affairs
        (DAF) changed four times.

        (iii) The violent coup which took place on August 6, 2008 severely disrupted the
        implementation of the project. For example, disbursements for this project, as well as for
        the whole Mauritanian portfolio (with exception of the locust project) were frozen since
        the coup, and due to the political situation the project remained inactive for one year.

        (iv) High turnover of Task Team Leaders (TTLs). During the four and half years of the
        project, the Bank’s TTL had changed four times. This frequent change had an adverse
        impact on the implementation of the project, such as creating a certain lack of continuity
        and ownership, and different approaches to supervision.

        (v) Lack of capacity. Overall lack of capacity, especially in human resources (HR), was a
        major impediment for project implementation. For example, infrastructural facilities in
        transportation and basic services were weak. There are very few institutions in the
        country to work with, to mobilize community development. Likewise, recruiting people
        with proper education and experience, especially in the field of nutrition, was also
        difficult.

        (vi) The lost opportunity to restructure for the reasons explained above, was an important
        factor which prevented the project from realizing a better outcome and a greater impact
        on Muaritania’s health sector.

        (vii) Other challenges that the project faced related to: (a) poor coordination between
        government and partners, (b) the operation of the monitoring and evaluation, and
        including coordination among all units collecting and analyzing data needed for
        monitoring of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) (c) the general lack of pro-activity
        units responsible for implementation Project, (d) the absence of an operational plan for
        infrastructure maintenance and sanitation, and (e) the relative lack of knowledge of Bank
        procedures.


2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization

32.     M&E design. The project’s M&E system was not properly designed during project
preparation. For example, project’s Outcome and Intermediate Indicators were not formulated
clearly and they did not have specific targets on these indicators. As mentioned in Section 2.1,
PDO’s specific objectives and indicators were misaligned. Instead, a better results-chain and
logical framework should have been developed for the selected interventions. Further, no
baseline values were available at the beginning of the project. This shortcoming affected project
monitoring.

33.    M&E implementation. Until the coup of August 2008, the DAF was collecting data
more or less regularly according to the indicators developed during project preparation. When
DAF had competent staff, the data collection was regular and efficient, but when DAF lacked
competent staff, data collection was not that regular, as at those periods, DAF was more
concerned with financial management than on M&E activities. However, after September 2009

                                                8
situation improved with the recruitment of two evaluation specialists for the health component
and one evaluation specialist for the nutrition component. Since then, the data collected were
closely monitored and analyzed on a regular basis. For example, every quarter the output data
collection was discussed with the officials in the rural areas.

34.      M&E utilization. The data collected during implementation was used by the Bank for
decision making. For example, these data influenced the Bank to proceed with restructuring the
project. However, the data collected was not utilized for any decision making by the government.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

35.      There were no significant deviations or waivers from the Bank’s safeguards and fiduciary
policies and procedures during the implementation of the project.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

36.     (a) Transition arrangements. The transition arrangements for continuing the future
operation appear to be adequate, as demonstrated by the following aspects.

37.     Financial. The MOHSA is currently purchasing generic drugs from non-profit central
procurement agencies but the Country Procurement agency for generic drugs is facing enormous
dysfunction due to the unavailability of funds. However, government will need to update cost
recovery system, and medical insurance scheme will need to be made mandatory. At present,
there are some schemes functioning for civil servants, but there is a need for the government to
unify the system.

38.     Staff and management are all in place at both the MOHSA and the MSACF, and they will
be paid from the government budget. Both Ministries have experienced staff working on health
and nutrition issues respectively.

39.      (b) Monitoring and evaluation. The DAF will be in charge of M&E of the health sector
after the project closure.

40.     (c) List of performance indicators: Those indicators directly related to health system will
continue to be used.

41.     (d) Future Impact Evaluation: If there is a follow-up project, evaluation within that
project should look at what has been the impact under HSNP project. As part of the project
preparation, there should be an assessment on what has been achieved and what needs to be done.

42.      (e) Follow-on project: A follow-on project is recommended on medical insurance/social
health financing/health system strenghthening.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

43.      The project’s objectives are still relevant, and important to Mauritania’s economic and
social development. They are timely and appropriate to the current needs of the country's health
sector. For example, several issues continue to hamper the performance of the health sector and

                                                9
  perhaps should have been addressed in the project design. These include: (a) insufficient and
  inequitable access, including problems with affordability and utilization of health and nutrition
  services; (b) inadequate financing and inequitable resource allocation; (c) shortages and low
  motivation of skilled health care providers; (d) inadequate drug quality and supply; (e)
  insufficient institutional capacity; and (f) poor management of service provision. PRSP-2 and the
  MTEF for the sector have highlighted these issues. Both government and external partners active
  in the sector are providing technical and financial support to develop a more functional health
  system. Considering these factors, the relevance of objectives, design and implementation is rated
  as Modest.

  3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

  44.     The project’s outcome is assessed based on: (i) the results of the Outcome and
  Intermediate Indicators shown in Section F of the Data Sheet; and (ii) many achievements related
  to capacity building activities which were not monitored under any specific indicators1.

  1.        For the reasons mentioned in Section 2.2, the project could not be restructured. As a
  result, many of the shortcomings of the M&E Indicators could not be corrected. That is why
  many achievements related to capacity building activities were not monitored under any specific
  indicators

45.     As shown in the Table above, out of six PDO Indicators Indicators 1 and 6 were not
achieved, and Indicators 2 and 4 were partially achieved. On the other hand, Indicator 3 and 5
were surpassed.

(b) Intermediate Outcome Indicators.

46.     As shown in Section F, out of the eight Intermediate Outcome Indicators, six were
achieved (including Indicator 5 which was surpassed) and two were not achieved (Indicators 1
and 6).

47.    The details of the project’s major outcomes and achievements are as follows:
Objective 1: Improving the accessibility to quality and affordable services in underserved
Health Areas

(i) Activities to improve access and quality of services:

        (a) Coverage of accessible and affordable health services in underserved areas as
        measured by the percentage of pregnant women to receive 2 doses of
        sulfadoxinepyrimethamine (SP)
        Even though targets were not achieved in any of the seven regions, a lot of progress has
        been made in the health service coverage with the provision of two doses of SP to
        pregnant women in these seven regions.


                                                 11
        (b) Access to affordable obstetric services as measured by the percentage of PNC in 14
        Moughatas (4 Wilayas) subsidizing services for pregnant women through an obstetric
        prepayment

        Target was exceeded in Assaba by 19%, but there was a shortage of 1 percent in Hodh el
        Chargui, 2 percent in Guidimaka and 9 percent in Hodh el Gharbi.

        (c) Rate of mass treatment for schistosomiasis in 4 wilayas (Trarza, Brakna, Gorgol,
        Guidimaka)

        The target were exceeded on all the 4 willayas. Mass deworming campaigns for the
        treatment of schistosomiasis covered the primary target population (209340 children in
        primary schools in four regions), about 28610 children in Koranic schools and about
        16000 at-risk adults. These campaigns have reduced transmission and morbidity
        associated with this disease.

        (d) Eight ambulances provided to regions have facilitated better access to basic health
        services to mothers and children living in remote areas of the country. Likewise, 40
        motorcycles to the head nurse of health posts (Poste de Santé -PS) have contributed to
        improved supervision of community health activities.

        (e) Training given in Ivory Coast to chief doctors working at health centers has
        contributed in improving their capacity for the management of basic health services.

(ii) Construction and equipment of health facilities based (PS and Type A Health Centers -
Centre de Santé de Type A -CSA):

48.     The project financed: construction of 13 PS and a CSA at Tintane; purchase of medical
and other equipment to these PS and CSA; 15 bags of maintenance tools for the maintenance
service of the Department of Infrastructure, Equipment and Maintenance; and installation of 20
solar power in 20 PS which do not have stable source of energy. All these activities have
contributed to improving the quality of health services.

Objective 2. Improving equitable allocation of resources to underserved areas:

(i) Mobilization and allocation of financial resources in the sector:

        (a) Directorate of Planning, Cooperation and Statistics (DPCIS) staff were trained in
        Tunisia on the monitoring of public spending on health, and locally on the methods of
        implementation and monitoring of national health accounts,

        (b) Analysis of public spending in the health sector was carried out in 2007-2008 and
        2010-2011 for the years 2004 to 2010. These public expenditure reviews of the health
        sector were carried out as part of updates on MTEF on health sector

        (c) Five members of the department were trained on the implementation of the MBB tool
        and methods of preparation of the MTEF health

        (d) The project supported the development and implementation of National Health
        Accounts (CSN)


                                                12
(ii) Strengthening measures to facilitate the financial accessibility to health services, increase use
of services by the poorest and most vulnerable, and to rationalize the existing cost recovery:

        (a) Staff were trained abroad in the field of financing community health care and the
        management of community development programs.

(iii) The project revitalized existing nine “mutuelles? that had 13 malfunctions and assisted in the
establishment of 20 new “mutuelles de sante? which are community based in rural districts. The
total number of mutuelles increased from nine in 2006 to 29 in 2011, including 25 mutuelles in
the target areas of the project and four other regions (Gorgol 2, 1 and Tagant Atar 1.

        (b) Several awareness campaigns were implemented for communities to renew the health
        committee members on the basis of newly established criteria.

        (c) Training was provided to 53% of members of health committees reconstituted or re-
        energized (in three stages the first stage covered 10%, 17% the second and third 26%.
        This training is in order to support the operation system of cost recovery and improve its
        contribution in the financing and use of health services.

Objective 3. Strengthening the Health Sector management to raise efficiency

49.    The project facilitated improving the efficiency of health sector management as
demonstrated by the following activities:

(i) Development of integrated sectoral approach:

        (a) Annual reviews of the health sector conducted each year monitored the results of the
        action of the health department during the past years and enabled to develop an action
        plan for the following year.

        (b) Several meetings of the Health Theme Group brought together industry partners
        around its programs to ensure technical and financial support of these partners for
        planned interventions.

        (c) The project supported development of the National Health Development Plan (PNDS)
        and mobilized partners on the problems of the sector and strategic directions.

        (d) Planning process was strengthened by: organizing regional, interregional and central
        annual planning workshops; training planning teams of the Department on planning
        process.

(ii) Monitoring and evaluation:

        (a) Tools developed for integrated supervision has seen the participation of all the
        structures involved in various phases (design, testing and validation). The tools
        developed were shared and distributed at the regional level for replication.

        (b) Several integrated supervision were conducted at the central level (4 integrated
        supervision with the participation of the Human Resources Department (HRD), an

                                                 13
        oversight by the HRD and an integrated supervision by DSSB without HRD) and 2
        missions to update indicators of the project (including one with the participation of the
        HRD)

        (c) Supported the collection of health information for the years 2008, 2009 and 2010 and
        published statistical yearbooks for 2009 and 2010 and organized two supervision
        missions to regional offices of the SNIS.

        (d) 13 focal areas NHIS were trained on optimizing the use of software and on the use of
        tools of the NHIS to improve the production of reports,


(iii) Professionalizing the human resources department at all levels (central and regional):

        (a) IT equipment and office furniture were provided to central and regional HRD;

        (b) six key personnel of the HRD received training abroad in the field of human resource
        management (human resource management planning, training, career monitoring, etc.);

        (c) two managers of HRD participated (Head of Training and Head of Department of
        personnel planning) in a seminar on development of health personnel in Benin in 2008;

        (d) monitoring of staff was computerized in different parts of the country;

        (e) 100% of health personnel files were updated to further develop human resources and
        their geographical distribution;

        (f) a management guide was developed on basic health structure;

        (g) a study was conducted to assess premiums and technical aspects and the introduction
        of performance bonuses; and

        (h) strategic plan on human resource development was updated and the technique was
        validated. Out of two workshops conducted, one was to upgrade and update the
        document and the second was for validation and approval of proposals by the technical
        team that performed the update.

(iv) Strengthening coordination mechanisms to ensure better management of human resources:

        (a) The project facilitated raising awareness within the regional authorities on the
        management of health personnel;

        (b) Several coordination meetings were held with regional authorities, DRAS and with
        other departments and agencies of Ministries concerned (Public Service, Finance,
        Education, etc.). About 9 meetings were conducted;

        (c) about six integrated supervision missions were conducted by the MOHSA with HR
        directorate’s participation to further develop human resources and their geographical
        distribution.



                                                14
Objective 4. Enhancing and expanding community-based communications for improved
nutrition

(i) Development and implementation of communication strategy for behavior change in nutrition
community

50.     The project developed a strategy in the medium and long term (2015) as part of the
National Strategy for Poverty Reduction and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.
It embodies the will of governments to prevent malnutrition in order to strengthen human capital
and to achieve the projected social and economic goals.

       (ii)    Improving conditions of access to community nutrition at the base.

       (a) The project has improved access to basic nutrition services. For example, a total of
       36 community nutrition centers (CNCs) have been opened in the areas of Nouakchott
       (numbering 20), Nouadhibou (numbering 5), Hodh El Gharbi (number 9) and Assaba
       (numbering 2).

       (b) The CNCs regularly received supply of iron folate and mebendazole for free
       distribution to pregnant and lactating women. In addition, the project also regularly made
       available to the Ministry of Health a significant amount of Vitamin A and Mebendazole
       to support national Vitamin A supplementation and de-worming program held every six
       months throughout the country.

       (c) CNCs conducted regular weighing of children before their systematic deworming
       with Mebendazole was available. In total the number of children served directly from
       these activities was 26497 every month.

       (d) CNCs held cooking demonstrations every three months and ensured that women are
       able to prepare nutritious food in their homes.

       (e) To sustain adequate food and nutrition behaviors, 91 activities that impact on
       nutrition were funded for benefit of women who run these cooperative centers.
       (f) The nutrition component was able to perform several actions to promote consumption
       of iodized salt in households. Specifically it provided the kit to test whether the salt
       marketed nationally and locally (village) is iodized and held regular sessions for the
       mobilization and awareness of women on the consumption of iodized salt (utility,
       nutritional, risk of iodine deficiency). In collaboration with the Ministry of Industry and
       Mines, the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Health, nutrition component
       contributed to the development and adoption of the decree on food fortification (flour,
       oil). The consumption of iodized salt thus increased from 1.1 in 2007 to 49.9 in 2010.

       (g) The project was instrumental in the creation of the National Council for the
       Development of Nutrition (CNDN). It has invested heavily in the development of this
       institution which is directly attached to the prime minister and chaired by the Prime
       Minister, with a Permanent Technical Committee (PTC), whose secretariat is provided by
       the nutrition component of the project.
       (h) Activities such as training, apprenticeships on management, and leadership programs
       have strengthened the capacity of central and regional structures of MASEF.


                                              15
        (i) Supervisors were trained on the basics of community nutrition, techniques of
        Information, Education and Communication (IEC) and community mobilization. This
        training was followed in 2008 by a second workshop upgrade which aimed to strengthen
        the skills of supervisors.

51.     Despite the above achievements, however, it is to be noted that:

        •   the selected indicators, regardless of the attained quantitative levels, did not fully
            reflect the extent to which the project objectives were actually achieved. For
            example, the first specific objective of HNSP is to improve access to basic health
            services. However, the coverage of health services will not likely adequately be
            measured by mass treatment campaigns for schistosomiasis or by intermittent therapy
            with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine as malaria prophylaxis for pregnant women; and
            these indicators do not measure access with its multiple dimensions such as
            geographic accessibility, availability, financial accessibility, and acceptability.
        •   While the inputs included in the project are reasonable, they fall short and far from
            actual actions, recognizable measures, or tangible progress towards attaining the
            stated objectives.
        •   Moreover, many project contributions are largely transitory. For example, as
            mentioned in Section 4, after the project closure, the platform for service delivery in
            rural areas has disappeared. Efficacy cannot be substantial in a scenario of manifest
            non-sustainability.
52.    Based on all the above reasons and the weak basis to assess the extent of actual
achievements, the efficacy is rated as Modest.

3.3 Efficiency

53.      The hospital sub sector accounts for 47 percent of health expenditures and has kept a low
utilization rate during the project’s period, with occupancy rates about 60 percent for tertiary
hospitals and 30 percent for regional hospitals. The reasons for this low occupancy rate seem to
be: (i) a lack of working referral mechanisms from the primary to the secondary, and from the
secondary to the tertiary level; (ii) a poor quality due to shortage of adequately trained specialist
physicians, shortage of drugs and degradation of physical infrastructure and equipment making it
that regional hospitals are not very different from health centers.

54.     The primary sub-sector seems to have fared better than hospitals. Utilization rates (as
measured by visit rates in some key regions) have increased from 0.42 to 0.55 during the project’s
period. Although Mauritania is still far from reaching the utilization rate of 1, which is the
“standard? rate evaluated by WHO for the developing countries, marked progress has been made
after two decades of stagnation.

55.       Patients are slowly changing their behavior. More patients are visiting the nearest health
post or health center, rather than going directly to a hospital, but patients attend primary level
facilities only if they consider the quality (and especially skilled staff, good equipment and drug
availability) of health care delivery as sufficient. Moreover, because quality improvement at
primary level remains extremely slow, the shift in behavior is also slow, but speed could be
increased by placing more skilled health staff (and especially medical doctors) in health centers,
which would imply more financing going to primary health care, and additional efficiency gains.


                                                 16
56.      With regard to the project’s nutrition component, progress has been high for a low to
moderate cost. On the one hand, government’s commitment to nutrition has strongly increased
with the creation of the nutrition unit within the State Secretariat for the Promotion of Women in
addition to the nutrition unit within the Ministry of Health. On the other hand, mothers’ feeding
behavior has improved (as shown by the rate of exclusive breastfeeding which increased from
less than 10% in 2003 to 19% in 2009). The percent of stunted under-five children decreased
from 35 in 2001 to 24.2 in 2009, while the percent of underweighted decreased from 32 to 20.3.
In conclusion, while gains in allocative efficiency have been substantial gains in technical
efficiency throughout the health components has been moderate. On the other hand, both
allocative and technical efficiencies have been improved substantially in the nutrition component.
Based on these factors efficiency for the whole project is rated as Substantial.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory

57.      While the project’s objectives are still relevant to Mauritania’s economic and social
development, and also timely and appropriate to the current needs of the country's health sector,
the issues with regard to project design suggest that relevance is rated as Modest. In light of the
discussion on the project’s achievements and outcomes as mentioned in Section 3.2, the project
efficacy is also rated as Modest. Further, as described in Section 3.3, the overall efficiency of the
project is Substantial

58.     Thus, based on a modest relevance, modest efficacy, and substantial efficiency, the
overall outcome rating is Moderately Unsatisfactory.

59.    In spite of the major shortcomings of the project, the capacity building investments,
however, would contribute to preparing Mauritania’s health sector for improving its future
performance and development.


3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60.     Poverty impact. The project has created a significant impact on nutrition. For example:
        • A total of 36 community nutrition centers (CNCs) have been opened in the areas of
           Nouakchott, Nouadhibou, Hodh El Gharbi, and Assaba
        • Iron folate and mebendazole are distributed freely to pregnant and lactating women
        • Vitamin A and Mebendazole are made available to MOHSA to support national
           Vitamin A supplementation and deworming program held every six months
           throughout the country.
        • CNCs held cooking demonstrations every three months and ensured that women are
           able to prepare them in their homes.
        • Health centers were built in the rural areas to improve vulnerable groups’ access to
           affordable health services.
        • Nutrition activities took place in the rural areas, where 3 out of 5 poor people live
           and worked mainly with women who are disproportionately affected by food
           insecurity, low access to economic and financial resources, as well as basic services.
        •


                                                 17
61.   Gender aspects: The project focused heavily on gender aspects. For example, pregnant
women are receiving free care, prenatal and delivery and post-natal care.

62.      Social development: Although the four and half year period of the project is too short a
period to expect any significant impact on social development, the project had some impact on
breast feeding because of behavioral changes brought out by the project.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

63.      The project resulted in a substantial institutional development impact as demonstrated by
the following:
         • At MOHSA, capacity of its staff has been strengthened, and basic health services
            have also been strengthened.
         • For service delivery, there is better deconcentration at the district level, with the Bank
            working in close coordination with wilayas. Responsibilities have been transferred to
            wallis, head of a wilaya. . Each walli is assisted by two deputies, out of whom, one
            deputy is exclusively working on social welfare including health. Wilayas have also
            developed good working relationship with regional departments of health.
         • The project has improved the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Social Affairs.
            The project facilitated setting up regional offices to work on nutrition-related
            activities.
         • Institutional collaboration between the Bank and the MOH has improved
            tremendously. For example, the MOU reached between the Bank and the MOH has
            resulted in developing a joint approach to community mobilization.
         • By rolling out a delivery platform for social services in underserved rural areas, the
            project helped in establishing basic service delivery in such areas.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

    •   The project contributed in renewing the engagement of the government for nutrition
        policy development. A technical advisor has been posted in the prime minister’s office
        for nutrition policy development.

    •   The involvement of the Bank has provided incentives for the government to give more
        emphasis on nutrition and include it as part of the government agenda.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

N/A

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

Ratings: Significant

64.    The ICR team considers that the risk to sustainability of the project’s achievements
would be significant based on the following factors:

        •   Low HR capacity at all levels in the country will continue to be a persistent problem,
            if the government does not maintain training and capacity building activities.

                                                 18
        •   Project had financed service delivery in rural areas. After the project closure, this
            platform has disappeared. For sustaining service delivery in rural areas, the
            government will need to provide the required financing.

        •   Regional political instability, security problems resulting from Al Queida presence in
            the country, and returning Mauritanians living in countries such as Tunisia, and
            Libya could pose some risks for the sustainability of the project’s achievements.

        •   On the other hand, as the system for supplying drugs is working fairly well, the risk
            of not sustaining the supply is only moderate.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

65.     As mentioned in the earlier sections, the project objectives were consistent with the
Bank’s country assistance strategy and the government priorities, and met the critical needs of the
health sector in Mauritania.

66.     Project preparation was carried out with an adequate number of specialists who provided
the technical skill mix necessary to address sector concerns and a good project design. The Bank
provided sufficient resources in terms of staff weeks and dollar amount to ensure quality
preparation and appraisal work. The country director and country manager were actively involved
during the preparation stage. The Bank took the lead in public expenditure analysis and capacity
building and also played a leading role in donor coordination and it s role as last resort lender was
well appreciated. As a result of successful donor coordination work, a Memorandum of
Understanding was signed and a “Partner Group for the Development of Health, Social Action
and Nutrition Sectors? was created. The Bank had a consistently good working relationship with
the Borrower during preparation and appraisal.

67.     During preparation, a number of alternatives was considered for the project design. In
addition, major risk factors and lessons learned from other earlier projects in the health sector
were considered and incorporated into the project design.

68.      On the other hand, the project design had some drawbacks. For example, given the
political instability and low institutional capacity, the project was over ambitious. As mentioned
in Section 2.1, the design was complex, with too many activities incorporated under five
components. Considering the country’s low absorptive capacity, many of its activities should
have been avoided and the project design be made more simple and realistic. Further, PDO lacked
clarity; and PDO’s specific objectives and indicators were ill-aligned. In addition, the timeframe
should have been scheduled for a period longer than three years. In light of these major
shortcomings, the overall quality at entry is rated Moderately Unsatisfactory.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory.



                                                 19
69.      The Bank's performance during the implementation of the project was satisfactory.
Sufficient budget and staff resources were allocated, and the project was adequately and
intensively supervised, and closely monitored. The task team prepared Aide-Memoires regularly
prepared and alerted the government and the DAF to problems with project execution and
facilitated remedies in a timely manner, in conformity with Bank procedures.               The
Implementation Status Reports (ISRs) realistically rated the performance of the project both in
terms of achievement of development objectives and project implementation. The task team also
monitored safeguard and fiduciary compliances.

70.      Bank’s procurement and financial management proficient staff worked with the DAF
staff to explain the rules and procedures to be applied during project implementation, with regard
to procurement of goods and works, and selection of consultants, accounts and audits, based on
the Credit Agreement.

71.      The task team carried out a Mid-Term Review in March 2008. Based on the
recommendations of the MTR, the Bank decided in agreement with the government, to
restructure the project. The task team was very proactive with the actions needed for the
restructuring process.

72.     The task team had good coordination and cooperation with the MOH, including the
Directorate of Basic Health Services. Similarly, the task team built a strong partnership with
UNICEF since November 2007. All the TTLs put lot of efforts and tried their best to keep the
project on track. The task team was innovative; and conducted monthly video conferences so they
could follow close supervision. In addition, task team was regularly visiting villages for
supervision and to follow-up on project activities.

73.      The Bank was very adaptable to support activities in the health sector. For example, when
HIV/AIDS project had fiduciary problems and was suspended, and the project still needed
support for treating patients. The Bank used funds from HSNP project to finance drugs and anti-
retroviral medicines.

74.    On the other hand, the project had a high turnover of TTLs, which, in turn, had an
adverse impact on the implementation of the project. Because of this major factor, the Bank
performance during supervision is rated Moderately Satisfactory.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

75.     Based on the Bank performance during lending phase and supervision as discussed above,
overall Bank Performance is rated as Moderately Unsatisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

76.     As mentioned in Section 2.1, the government had shown its commitment to the objectives
of the project at the time of project preparation. However, during implementation, government
commitment was uneven. While the commitment was strong at times, it wavered at other times.
Likewise some Ministers of Health were very highly committed and actively involved with the
project whereas, some were not very enthusiastic about the project. Prior to MTR, low


                                               20
disbursement in Components 1 and 2 reflected the lack of ownership and leadership from the
MOHSA Directorates in charge of their implementation. Similarly, performance of the DAF
depended on individual directors; while some were dynamic, others were not so.

77.      On the whole, government was very supportive. For example, although the project was
inactive since the coup of August 2008, the MOHSA had continued implementing the key
activities supported by this project, which were Components 3, 4 and 5, using funds from other
donors such as Spain, France, (which were larger funders than the Bank), UNICEF and others.
After the Bank resumed activities in Mauritania in October 2009, and the project restarted its
implementation, the government maintained its commitment reasonably well, and saw to it that
the project concluded on a positive note.

78.     The government officials worked closely with the Bank's project team on a continual
basis, and cooperated fully with the task team. Appropriate levels of review and approval were
usually in place; financial accountability and follow-up was observed, and expenditures were
duly authorized before they were incurred; and documentation was maintained properly for
periodic review. The project did not suffer from any counterpart funding problems, as the
government took timely corrective measures and made appropriate budget provisions.

Procurement Management.

79.     (a) MOHSA: The procurement implementation for the project can be ranked Moderately
Unsatisfactory. It was affected by political instability. The procurement process had taken more
than 18 months in several cases, and several contracts had to be re-advertised. The procurement
staff had switched several times . The first team that had good experience and knowledge about
the Bank procedures was replaced by a new team that had no experience with procurement
procedures.

80.     (b) MSACF. The procurement implementation of MASEF was moderately satisfactory,
because the project team remained despite the political instability and it capitalized the
experience of NUTRICOM. The civil work component was satisfactorily executed as it was
implemented by AMEXTIPE that was not affected by the political events, and the bidding
documents of medical centers were ready before the project effectiveness.

81.      Financial Management. The financial management of the project was moderately
satisfactory due to weaknesses in the internal control system, especially the accuracy of the
supporting documentation and the long delay in producing justification of activities occurred in
regions. Going forward, the government will need to strengthen the internal control environment
of the implementing entity, and deeply involve the internal audit unit (inspection) of the minister,
in the control of expenditures due to the fact that the MAP project funded by the Bank showed
that US$344,888 were misused by the National Council in charge of HIV/AIDs. (Ibrahim,
as discussed at the review meeting, can you please kindly request FMS to expand on
Financial Management? Also, to talk about governance problems in the country, but this
project was not affected)

82.     Reporting Arrangements. The DAF submitted all required quarterly and annual reports
in a timely manner. These reports were informative, and provided valuable feedback on how the
agency was progressing covering all project activities.




                                                21
(b) Implementing Agency Performance

As the two implementing agencies, MOHSA and MSACF are part of the government, their
performance is described in Section 5. 2 (a) above.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Unsatisfactory.

83.     In light of the Government performance as discussed above, the overall performance of
the Borrower was moderately unsatisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned

       •   Continuity of the project team, especially the TTL, is very important both for the
           Bank and the Borrower. Frequent changes in TTL create a certain lack of continuity
           and ownership, and different approaches to supervision.

       •   Lack of capacity. For a country like Mauritania with low capacity: (i) the project
           design should be simple, with limited number of components and clear project
           objectives; (ii) .proper planning for strengthening human resource is important; (iii)
           the Bank should be proactive to provide the needed technical assistance to the
           counterpart; and (iv) in the health sector, it is necessary to give incentives for staff to
           go out and work in regional hospitals.

       •   Proper coordination and good relationship. For smooth project implementation, it is
           important to have proper coordination and good relationship between the relevant
           ministries involved with the implementation of the project.

       •   Political stability in the country is important for the smooth implementation and
           success of a project. For example, political instability which prevailed in the country
           during the life of the project created a difficult environment for implementation.
           During four and half years of the project, there were two coup d’ etats, (the first one
           on August 3, 2005, and the other on August 6, 2008); the Prime Minister changed
           four times, the Minister of Health had changed eight times, and the Director of
           Directorate of Financial Affairs (DAF) changed four times. All these changes
           occurred because of the political instability which prevailed in the country during the
           project period.

       •   M&E Indicators. The project’s M&E system should be properly designed during
           project preparation. For example, project’s Outcome and Intermediate Indicators
           were not formulated clearly and they did not have specific targets on these indicators.
           As mentioned in Section 2.1, PDO’s specific objectives and indicators were
           misaligned. Instead, a better results-chain and logical framework should have been
           developed for the selected interventions. Further, no baseline values were available
           at the beginning of the project. These shortcomings in the M&E system affected
           project monitoring.

Component 5.       Enhance and expand community-based communications for improved
nutrition

5.1.1. Development and implementation of, communication strategy for behavior change in
nutrition community


                                               31
Developed strategy in the medium and long term (2015) as part of the National Strategy for
Poverty Reduction and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. It embodies the will
of governments to prevent malnutrition in order to strengthen human capital and to achieve the
projected social and economic goals. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to MASEF communities
the main actors of improving the nutritional status of families, women, children, ... now
establishing in the minds of all the inextricable link between good health and good nutrition.

5.1.2. Communication media have been designed and produced in close consultation and
collaboration with relevant partners. Media designs were completed by a technical group of
experts (Communications and Nutritionists) created by the nutrition component, the technical
group has completed the following media:

        • A Pagi volt (flip chart sound) on breastfeeding with different themes (Last in immediate,
        exclusive breastfeeding to six months, introduction of complementary feeding after six
        months)• A Pagivolt on the needs and nutritional balance, Other materials such as mass
        awareness were developed:
        • Firmware audio and video on topics such as putting in immediate, exclusive
        breastfeeding to six months, and breastfeeding from 6 to 24 months;• Posters and
        nutrition educational games were also designed and are being finalized,

5.2. Improve conditions of access to community nutrition at the base

5.2.1. Free distribution of iron folate for women and vitamin A to children every six months.

The ANC regularly received a supply of iron folate and mebendazole for free distribution to
pregnant and lactating women. In addition, the project also regularly made available to the
Ministry of Health a significant amount of Vitamin A and Mebendazole Campaign to support
national vitamin A supplementation and deworming program held every six months throughout
the country.

5.2.2. Monthly monitoring of the growth of children under 24 months

•. The ANC, conducted regular weighing of children before their systematic deworming with
Mebendazole available. In total the number of children served directly from these activities was
26497 every month (average of 2010).

5.2.3. Promotion of local products to improve the nutritional status of children and women

The Community Nutrition Officer (ANC) led the cooking demonstration sessions and ensured
that women are able to reproduce in their homes the menu shown. ANC held cooking
demonstrations on average every three months.

5.2.4. Funding for activities having a direct impact on nutrition

• To sustain adequate food and nutrition behaviors and prevent the shutdown of communication
in the CNC, 91 activities that impact on nutrition were funded cooperative groups for the benefit
of women who run these centers. The recipients are accountable for the management and conduct
of all activities of the projects installed in the CNC.




                                                32
5.2.5. Contribution to the development of regulations implementing the law on iodized salt

The nutrition component was able to perform several actions to promote consumption of iodized
salt in households. Specifically it has provided kits to CNC to test whether the salt marketed
nationally and locally (village) is iodized and held regular in all CNC sessions mobilization and
awareness of women on the consumption of iodized salt (utility, nutritional, risk of iodine
deficiency, ...). In collaboration with the Ministry of Industry and Mines, the Ministry of
Commerce, the Ministry of Health, nutrition component contributed to the development and
adoption of the decree on food fortification (flour, oil ).

5.2.6. Strengthening the institutional framework in charge of nutrition in Mauritania.

The Government adopted the decree creating the National Council for the Development of
Nutrition (CNDN). In collaboration with the prime minister, the MAED, MS, MDR, MASEF, the
CSA, ... and agencies of the United Nations represented at Nouakchott (UNICEF, WFP, WHO,
UNFPA, UNDP, FAO). Nutrition component worked for the creation of the CNDN. It has
invested heavily in the development of this institution which is directly attached to the prime
minister and chaired by the Prime Minister, with a Permanent Technical Committee (PTC),
whose secretariat is provided by the nutrition component of the project.

5.3. Strengthen the capacity of MASEF planning, monitoring and evaluation of communication
programs for behavior change.

Activities such as training, apprenticeships on management, and leadership programs have
strengthened the capacity of central and regional structures of MASEF.

5.4. Monitoring and evaluation.
• A manual of procedures for monitoring and evaluation system was developed at the start up of
the project. Monitoring forms and records are made available to all 193 CNC. The project
provided technical support every year to the department as part of the commemoration of the
International Women's Day on March 8th .

5.5. Equipment of the Regional Coordination MASEF

• The Nutrition component financed the construction of two buildings intended to house the
offices of two regional coordination of the Ministry of Social Affairs, Childhood and Family
Brakna (Aleg) and Tagant (Tidjikja). The buildings were completed in 2010.
• Equipment has been purchased and distributed to unit-level project management and
coordination, and seven regional MASEF.
• Six vehicles were purchased in 2007 for strengthening the capacity of MASEF•
Communications equipment (TV, video, digital cameras, tape recorders, ...) was acquired for each
antenna and each CNC to cover the need for communication and documentation.

5.6. Setting up a database on the poor:The project has been successful in the implementation of a
software database at central and regional (list with complete information on patient monitoring
etc.) and the formation of a core team at the central and regional levels for the use of software.

5.7. Capacity building of staff of the component

5.7.1. Training of supervisors and regional IEC Nutrition


                                                   33
• At the start of the project, the nutrition component organized a training workshop for the benefit
of 14 regional supervisors (nutritionists and communicators) prior to their assignment in the
wilaya in 2007. The workshop was facilitated by two senior specialists, a nutritionist and a
specialist in IEC. For seven days these supervisors were trained on the basics of community
nutrition, techniques of IEC and community mobilization. This training was followed in 2008 by
a second workshop upgrade which aimed to strengthen the skills of supervisors.

5.7.2. Training of 193 ANC The Project Management Unit conducted training in IEC and
community nutrition agents for the benefit of 193 Community Nutrition (ANC) chosen by the
unions of women's cooperatives to ensure management activities of CNC.
• After validation of the national communication strategy and the adoption of new media, the

5.7.3. Management training unit for coordination and project management• All those responsible
for the management unit of the project have received training as part of capacity building. Thus in
2008 the Coordinator of the component participated in an international seminar on planning,
execution and project control. Likewise, the head of M & E participated in an international
seminar on computer tools applied to a device for monitoring and evaluation.

5.7.4. Formation of a pool of Mauritanian journalists on Nutrition (Reuters initiative and
UNICEF) in 2010.

This training and field visits have allowed journalists to have accurate information on the
problems of community nutrition, which enabled them to produce articles and reports on the
CNC and community nutrition.

5.7.5. Training of supervisors and community volunteers on WFP communications strategy for
behavior change in nutrition.

Several training workshops were conducted for training NGOs and community volunteers
responsible for ensuring the supervision of CRENAM funded by WFP. These workshops focused
on the key messages on community nutrition (such as breastfeeding, and complementary feeding).
In total 476 community volunteers were trained in six regions.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis
(including assumptions in the analysis)

3.1 A project specific economic and financial analysis was not conducted for this project at
appraisal time for the following reasons: (i) HNSP was understood as a follow-on project to the
Health Sector Investment and the Nutricom projects for which such analyses were conducted; (ii)
the HNSP’s overarching goal was to assist Government to reach MDG by means of well proven
cost effective strategies; and (iii) a Public Expenditures Review was conducted just before
appraisal and considered to provide relevant information on and analysis of the sector policy from
an economic perspective. Moreover, a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework 2005-2007 was
also developed a short time prior to appraisal. It aimed at helping the sector become more results-
oriented, reduce inefficiencies and, better support the Government’s efforts to reach the MDGs.
This implied that the baseline data for the ICR economic analysis had to be “re-constructed?.

3.2      As an in-between two SWAPs, the project’s focus was on: (i) Building capacities,
especially in the areas of planning, budgeting, financing, management and human resources; and
(ii) Improving service delivery. Its efficiency should thus be measured, first, in terms of allocative
efficiency and, second, technical efficiency.

3.3      Health expenditures increased during the period 2006-2010, from $18.18 to $22.39 per
capita (average exchange rate of $). Total expenditure on health as a percent of GDP went from
2.1 in 2006 to 2.5 in 2010. Per capita government expenditure on health increased from $12 to
$14 (average exchange rate of $) during this period, while general government expenditure on
health as a percent of government expenditure remained at 4.9%.

3.4    The respective shares of the main health financing sources (cost recovery, government
budget and external) have altered between 2007 and 2010. Cost-recovery went from 15.42% to
16.41%; Government budget from 61.47% to 57.42%; and external donors from 23.11% to
26.18%.

3.5     If external resources for health as a percent of total expenditure on heath increased from
17.3 to 26.18%, there is nevertheless a marked reduction in donor financing as compared to 1999
where donors financed 55% of the spending in the sector. IDA contributed to finance
approximately 17% of total (government and donors) spending in the sector, other donors
contributing to a little less (an average of 9%).

3.6      The national health sector policy and the MTEF, supported by the Health and Nutrition
Support Project (HNSP), have been moderately successful in improving efficiency and equity by
shifting health expenditures towards: (i) high cost-effective interventions; (ii) primary health care;
and (iii) services in rural and remote areas. In other words, the sector policy is being oriented
towards better serving the need of the poorest segments of the population.

3.7     Over the period 2006-2010, the allocation of funds to the hospitals (from 41 to 47%) and
to the health posts and centers (from 17 to 20%) increased while the allocation to the
administration (from 24 to 17%) and drugs (12 to 10%) decreased, and the allocation to public
health programs remained at 6%. This is the result of: (i) an increase in the number of hospitals
(new and rehabilitated), and (ii) further decentralization of health financing and management.




                                                 35
3.8     Accessibility to Health Post and Centers has increased from 63% in 2003 to 75% in 2007.
And most coverage rates have also increased as illustrated by the DPT3 coverage that went from
53 in 2000 to 64 in 2009. ANC1 (1 visit) reached 75 and ANC4 (4 visits) 16 in 2009.

3.9    he decrease of 7 points of percentage in the Administration allocation resulted in an
improved efficiency that could be further improved with additional reallocations from the
Administration to the health care facilities.

3.10 Mauritania has made remarkable efforts in redirecting health spending towards
decentralized units. Now more than 57 percent of the health sector budget is spent in
decentralized units compared to 40 percent targeted. However, the poorest regions have benefited
less than others and equity has not been achieved as intended. Richer regions tend to spend more
public money per person compared with the poor regions. Also the imbalance between rural and
urban areas has further deteriorated, the ratio decreasing from 1/5 to 1/8 during the period 2005-
2010.

3.11   If decentralization first resulted in a decrease in the budget execution rate, the issues of
low absorptive capacity and late release of funds that caused an important gap between allocated
budgets and actual spending have been partly remedied to. As a result the budget execution rate
showed a marked increase from 88.6% to 94.7%.

3.12 Looking at the ratio Investment/Recurrent Expenditures, the right balance (evaluated
between 0.4 and 1), which means that enough capacity to implement the needed activities is
generated, has been maintained during the project period.

3.13 Regarding the affordability of services, a system of exemptions exists for underprivileged
people, for preventive services like immunizations and for curative services needed in relation to
conditions such as tuberculosis, leprosy etc., which have strong public externalities.

3.14 Although the size of cost recovery schemes at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels is
relatively small, these arrangements have succeeded in keeping drugs accessible to the poor.
Improving the cost-recovery scheme, which has been a great success when first launched in the
early 90s’, was one of the project’s objectives. Studies to revise tariff have been undertaken, but a
new tariff has yet to be approved. This scheme, and the exemption system attached to it, is losing
its efficiency. There is a need to deeply revise it and to start experimenting new risk-pooling
schemes.

3.15    Has service delivery’s performance kept up with expenditures? In other words, has the
technical efficiency followed the same improved pattern as allocative efficiency?

3.16     The hospital sub sector that accounts for 47 percent of health expenditures has kept a low
utilization rate during the project’s period, with occupancy rates about 60 percent for tertiary
hospitals and 30 percent for regional hospitals. Reasons for this low occupancy rate seem to be:
(i) a lack of working referral mechanisms from the primary to the secondary, and from the
secondary to the tertiary level; (ii) a poor quality due to shortage of adequately trained specialist
physicians, shortage of drugs and degradation of physical infrastructure and equipment making it
that regional hospitals are not very different from health centers.

3.17    The primary sub-sector seems to have fared better than the hospitals’. Utilization rate (as
measured by visit rates in some key regions) has increased from 0.42 to 0.55 during the project’s
period. Although Mauritania is still far from reaching the utilization rate of 1, which is the

                                                 36
“standard? rate evaluated by WHO for the developing countries, marked progress has been made
after two decades of stagnation.

3.18    Patients are slowly changing their behavior. An increased number of patients is visiting
the nearest health post or health center, rather than going directly to a hospital. However, it has
been observed that patients attend primary level facilities only if they consider the quality (and
especially skilled staff, good equipment and drug availability) of health care delivery as sufficient.
And because quality improvement at primary level remains extremely slow, the shift in behavior
remains slow. Speed could be increased by placing skilled health staff and especially medical
doctors in health centers, which would imply more financing going to primary health care, and
additional efficiency gains.

3.19 With regard to the project’s nutrition component, progress has been high for a low to
moderate cost. On the one hand, government’s commitment to nutrition has strongly increased
with the creation of the nutrition unit within the State Secretariat for the Promotion of Women in
addition to the nutrition unit within the Ministry of Health. On the other hand, mothers’ feeding
behavior has improved (as shown by the rate of exclusive breastfeeding which increased from
less than 10% in 2003 to 19% in 2009). The percent of stunted under-five children decreased
from 35 in 2001 to 24.2 in 2009, while the percent of underweighted decreased from 32 to 20.3.

3.20     In conclusion, gains in efficiency have been substantial in allocative efficiency and
moderate in technical efficiency throughout the health components. In the meantime, both
allocative and technical efficiencies have been high within the nutrition component. Also, for the
whole project, efficiency is rated as s

Annex 7. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR

The project achieved significant results in reaching the majority of its indicators and
targets. The results that were obtained are distributed among the four Health components
and a nutrition component with, of course, disparities in terms of importance between
them.

1. Health components

Development of human resources, several interventions were conducted and produced
significant results. These interventions have improved the skills of the Human Resources
staff, the technical capabilities of the services, and the management system of the
department in general. The results represent significant progress towards the
professionalization of the Human resources development. It showed improve
coordination between the internal and external structures involved in the management
and training of staff.

About the adequate funding of the sector and the equitable allocation of resources,
although most of the interventions included in this component were delayed, the
indicators associated with them made good progress. The most important results concern
the updating of the MTEF, strengthening of cost recovery through training of health
committee, the implementation of interventions to promote mutual health and expansion
of the obstetrical care package. It should be noted that, although significant progress
were made, expectations have not yet been met, given the volume of activities originally
planned under this component.

Management capacities in the sector were strengthened through the training of several
key directorates (planning, financial management, procurement, monitoring and
evaluation). Equipment of the central and regional directorates and technical support
were provided and financial management tools developed .The greatest achievements
involved the completion of the National Health Development Plan, the National Health
account, the continued support to the National Health Information, the development of a
computerized infrastructure, materials and equipment management system in the
department of Infrastructure and equipment. The component also helped develop a plan
for the development of CAMEG (central drugs procurement office) and allowed an
analysis of the situation in the pharmaceutical sector which, in turn, helped improve the
management capabilities in the field of medicines.

In terms of improving people's access to health services, achievements with significant
effects were performed. The results include among others the construction of 13 health
centers, the rehabilitation and equipment of 8 health centers and the contribution to health
programs, such as immunization, mass distribution of mebendazole and reproductive
health etc… The component also contributed in improving the logistic supports by
providing ambulances.

Financially, the execution shows a disbursement rate of about 96% and no rejection of
monthly withdrawal applications which are the proof of the good management and
accounting system of the project.

As regards to performance indicators, 7 of 11 met or exceeded their target values, the
other 4 showed real progress equal or above the two thirds of their target values. Project
performance fluctuated between moderately satisfactory and unsatisfactory. This
performance is beyond the average which seems to be the result of many efforts made by
both parties to overcome obstacles and ensure proper implementation of the project. The
evaluation showed that the action of the government and domestic coordination were not
always the answer or feedback needed at the right time. Some missed opportunities can
explain why the project did not achieve some indicators. One of the missed opportunities
was the cancellation of the restructuring planned to align different levels of the project,
particularly targets and indicators, and indicators and proposed interventions. Other
factors that had a negative impact on the project targets were the absence of the sectoral
steering committee and the high mobility of project coordinators.

2. Nutrition component

193 Community Nutrition Centers (CNC were opened by the project and managed by
women's cooperatives. The target groups for the nutrition component are: children 0-5
years with priority to 0 to 24 months, pregnant women, breastfeeding women, mothers in
general, and female heads of household.
In terms of assessing the achievement of development goals of the nutrition component,
these achieved goals are noteworthy:
A notable trend in the practice of exclusive breastfeeding increased from 21.6% in 2007
to 45.9% in 2010.
The consumption of iodized salt in households in Mauritania increased from 1.1% in
2007 to 49.9% in 2010
At the Ministry level, the nutrition component contributed to strengthen the MASEF
capacity in planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. In this regard, it should
be noted that for the first time in Mauritania, a National Communication strategy for
behavioral change has been developed. This strategy was adopted by all nutrition partners
in the country. Another achievement of the project is the adoption by the Government of
a decree establishing the National Council for the Development of Nutrition (CNDN).
