CHIAPAS RURAL ROADS PROJECT (LOAN 2525-ME)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PREFACE
The following is a Project Completion Report on the Chiapas Rural
Roads Project for which a loan in the amount of US$22.0 million was
approved by the Board of Directors on April 30, '985. Only US$1.06 million
of Lhe loan funds were disbursed. The remainder was cancelled in two
stages: US$10.0 million on July 27, 1987 and US$10.94 million on December
17, 1988 retroactive to May 30, 1988.
The Project Completion Report was jointly prepared by the
Infrastructure and Energy Operations Division, Country Department II, of
the Latin America and the Caribbean Regional Office. (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and III) and the Executing Agency, Mexico's Secretariat of
Communications and Transport (Part II).
Preparation of this Project Completion Report is based, inter
alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan and Guarantee Agreements;
supervision reports; correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower; and
internal Bank memoranda.

CHIAPAS RURAL ROADS PROJECT (LOAN 2525-ME)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
Evaluation Summary
Objectives
1.       The Chiapas Rural Roads Project was to support the development of
the state of Chiapas through a program of construction, rehabilitation,
improvement and maintenance of rural roads coordinated with simultaneous
agricultural and other social and economic development efforts.1 The
project was to provide for: (a) the construction of about 1,000 km of
rural roads; (b) the rehabilitation and improvement of approximately 2,000
km of existing roads; and (c) consulting services for detailed engineering
and technical assistance. The selected roads were expected to provide
improved access to rural areas so as to reduce transportation costs and
increase agricultural production, and also to improve access for the
efficient provision of social services and for employment opportunities.
At the time of project appraisal it was envisaged that the project, where
appropriate, would promote the use of labor-intensive construction
techniques to increase the employment      rtunities for unemployed -nd
underemployed local residents (para. 3 -
ImDlementation Experience
2.       Between 1984 and 1988 only 443 km of rural roads were constructed
in Chiapas by SCT, and about 1,000 km were reconstructed or rehabilitated.
Although this amounts to about halt of the appraisal physical targets, only
5% of the loan was disbursed. This is because many of the works carried
out did not have the documentation necessary for Bank disbursement (i.e.,
economic analysis and/or environmental impact analyses by the Secretariat
of Urban Development and Ecology (SEDUE)) or were carried out according to
procurement practices not acceptable to the Bank. In addition, delay in
submitting documentation for disbursements eroded the dollar equivalent of
the expenditures made since at the time the Mexican peso underwent a
continuing process of devaluation (para. 5.04).
1/ The Chiapas Agricultural Development Project (Loar; 2526-ME), a
complementary project, was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on
the same day as the Chiapas Rural Roads Project. Loan 2526-ME included
also a rural roads component, to be carried out by the Secretariat of
Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH) in a different area of influence
than those financed under Loan 2525-ME.

3.       Despite thorough project preparation which included a detailed
Project Implementation Document and a list of tasks to be carried out in
order to complete the assessment of different groups of roads to be
financed under the loa:-, SCT's rural road investments in Chiapas were
mostly carried out without Bank participation. The US$2 million disbursed
for the Special Account inmediately after the loan became effective were
partially drawn-down only after the Government decided to completely cancel
the loan. The Government, by DecemEer 1988. could justify eligible
expenditures for US$1.06 million, and US$0.94 million were reimbursed to
the Bank (paras. 5.01 and 5.03).
Results
4.       The project financed the construction of about 160 km of rural
roads with an estimated ex-post economic rate of return of 13%, as compared
to the 19% envisaged at appraisal. The less-than-expected returns are
mostly explained by the lack of complementary agricultural services that
were to have an important impact on agricultural output. Because the
institutional component of the project never took off, its impact on that
area did not go beyond the limited on-the-job training that the exposure to
Bank evaluation techniques provided to the staff in SCT-Chiapas (para.
6.01).
Sustainabilitv
5.       Sustainability of the limited accomplishments under the project
will mainly depend on Chiapas's future efforts in road maintenance. At
present, road maintenance is inadequate. But the Bank is considering a
road project with heavy emphasis on strengthening future road ma4ntenance
capability of the States. As a result, future road maintenance may improve
and positively affect the sustainability of the Chiapas Rural Roads Project
(para. 6.01).
Findingj and Lessons Learned
6.       Project implementation and withdrawal from the Bank loan account
required SCT-Chiapas, SCT's regional office, to have an important role in
data gathering and in conducting the analysis of project justification,
tasks for which they were ill-prepared. Lack of experience in these
matters could have been a surmountable problem and the implementation of
the technical assistance component of the project, which never took off,
could have helped in this regard. However, the executing agencies had very
low motivation, andt many disincentives to use loan funds since the external
financing did not result in additional funding to the agency but was meant
to substitute Federal funding, which was available with fewer strings
attached (i.e.: as regards project justification and procurement
requirements) (para. 7.01).
7.       The Bank's requirements with respect to the economic justification
of subprojects eligible for financing under the project were perceived as
obscure by those officials in Chiapas unfamiliar with cost-benefit
analyses. However, as already stated, this problem could have been
surmounted if the Government would have given priority to the project
(para. 9.01).



v 
8.       The main lesson to be learned from the project is not a new one.
It relates to the need to ascertain, early in the project cycle, the strong
commitment of those agencies and/or levels of technical staff that are in
the critical path of successful project implementation. In addition, the
Bank should try to balance the need to ensure the economic viability of the
projects it funds with the limited capability of those in charge of
conducting the assessment. Finally, from the moment the Borrower and the
Bank decided that the best course of action was to cancel the loan, two
years had elapsed until it was actually canceled. This was the result of
the time required by the different Government agencies involved, (NAFIN,
SCT, the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit and the Secretariat of
Programming and Budgeting) to reach consensus on the future of the loan.
These delays probably reflected the Borrower's expectation that the project
could be turned around, but with hindsight there were no objective reasons
to expect this (para. 8.02).

Sector:                           Transport
2.       Background
2.01     The State of Chiapas is, economically and socially, one of the
least developed of Mexico. Per-capita income is estimated at US$ 350, as
compared to the national average of US$2250. From its population of about
2.3 million, near one-third live :'.n urban areas, and the remaining two-
thirds in rural areas, an opposite, relationship to the national population
distribution. Statewide, poverty is prevalent and malnourisiament among
children is widespread. The child mortality rate (between the ages of 1 and
4) is of 85.2 deaths per thousand children, quite above the national
average of 42.9. The population has the highest illiteracy rate (34%)
compared to the national rate of 20%. One of the main obstacles for
improving the socio-economic environment has been the difficult terrain
which hinders access to the widely disperse population. This, coupled with
adverse climatic conditions, lack of proper drainage, limited extension and
other agricultural services, lack of storage and inadequate transport
access, makes increases in agricultural production (the main source of
income) very difficult.
2.02     To help define a comprehensive development strategy for Chiapas, a
multisectoral Bank mission visited Mexico in late 1981. The recommendations
of the joint Bank/Government Working Group formed the basis for the Chiapas
Development Plan (Plan Chiapas), officially adopted by the Government in
May 1983. Two priority elements were selected as crucial to the initial
stages of the program and provided an appropriate instrument for Bank
financing: agricultural development and rural roads. Two projects: the
Chiapas Agricultural Development Project and the Chiapas Rural Roads
Project, were thus prepared in parallel.
3.       Proiect Objectives and DescriRtion
3.01     The Chiapas Rural Roads Project was to support the development of
the State of the Chiapas through the implementation of a rural roads
construction, rehabilitation, improvement and maintenance program
coordinated with simultaneous agricultural and other social and economic



-2-
development efforts. 1 The project was to provide for: (a) the construction
of about 1000 km of rural roads: (b) the rehabilitation and improvement of
about 2000 km of existing rural roads; and (c) related consulting services
for detailed engineering and technical assistance. The selected roeds were
expected to provide improved access to rural areas to reduce costs and
increase production and/or improve access for the efficient provision of
social services and for employment opportunities. At the time of project
appraisal it was envisaged that the project, when appropriate, would
promote the use of labor-intensive construction techniques to increase the
employment opportunities for unemployed and underemployed local residents.
3.02     To ensure the full realization of the expected benefits, the Rural
Roads Project was also going to focus upon the Governments efforts to:
(a) strengthen the state's planning and decision making
capabilities in Chiapas;
(b) improve planning, programming, construction, rehabilitation,
improvement and maintenance programs of rural roads in Chiapas;
(c) assess rural transport services for freight and passengers in
Chiapas; and
(d) extend lessons learned in Chiapas to other states.
3.03     Project preparation was delayed by the change in Government and
the need to confirm the support of the new administration to the objectives
of the project. The project was appraised in February, 1984 and
netotiations took place in Washington from February 25 to March 20, 1985.
The loan became effective in April 4, 1986, about six months later than
originally scheduled. In retrospect, these delays were an early indication
that the new Government, beleaguered by Mexico's financial crisis and
severe cuts in public investments, did not assign high priority to this
particular project.
4.       Project Design and Organization
4.01     The project was designed as a component of a multisectoral effort
to address widespread poverty in Chiapas. Thoroughly prepared, it included
a detailed Project Implementation Document detailing methodologies and
procedures for subproject selection and execution. This document is still
used as a valuable example for rural roads projects in the Region. __i
main accomplishments were its innovative approach to balance the demand for
resources to address social needs in those cases in which economic
benefits are not readily quantifiable and its attempt to simplify, to the
extent possible, the measurement of the project's benefits. The approach.
described in para. 3.03 of Part II of this report, consisted
of a staged evaluaSion of the generated agricultural producer
1/ The Chiapas Agricultural Development Project (Loan 2526-ME), a
complementary project, was approved by the Bank's Board of Directors on
the same day than the Chiapas Rural Roads Project. Loan 2526-ME
included also a rural roads component, to be carried out by the
Secretariat of Agriculture and Water Resources (SARH) in a different
area of influence than those financed under Loan 2525-ME.

surplus. However, those roads in areas with limited agricultural potential
and high population concentration were considered "social" roads. The
number of -oads with a predominantly social justification could not exceed
15% of the construction program and each such road could not exceed a
construction cost of US$450 per person served.
4.02     Project identification and design involved several Government
Amencies at the State and Federal levels. While the project was clearly
understood by those participating in this process, in retrospect it appears
that it did not elicit the same degree of support among them. In
particular, the Planning and Budgeting Secretariat (SPP) was the driving
force behind the Plan Chiapas. On the other hand, the executing agency,
the Communications and Transportation Secretariat (SCT) might have seen the
implementation of this project as cumbersome, involving evaluationi
exercises in a state with limited data and even more limited capability to
process it.
5.       Project Imnlemeatatio..
5.01     Despite the substantial effort during project preparation which,
in addition to the already mentioned Project Implementation Document,
included a detailed list of tasks to be carried out in order to complete
the assessment of different groups of roads identified for possible Bank
financing, SCT's rural road investments in Chiapas were mostly carried out
without Bank participation. The US$2.0 million disbursed for the Special
Account immediately after the loan became effective were only partially
drawn-down once the Government decided to cancel the loan. The following
paragraphs discuss the efforts to implement the project and the steps
leading to the cancellation of most of the loan funds.
5.02     From the onset the project suffered from the severe reduction in
public expenditures that Mexico undertook as part of its macroeconomic
adjustment program. In 1986, SCT's construction of rural roads in Chiapas
amounted to about 35km, as compared to the 150-200km envisaged at
appraisal. Not only was the lack of counterpart funds resulting in a slow
rate of project execution, but no documentation was submitted to the Bank
for the financing of the small amount of eligible expenditures that were
incurred. This is also true of the construction works carried out between
July 1984 and July 1986, for which the loan provided retroactive financing
at the exchange rate of the date in which the expenditure took place.
5.03     In November of 1986, only seven months after the loan became
effective, the Bank was recommending its cancellation. By then, two Bank
missions had visited Chiapas to familiarize local SCT professionals with
the procedures related to project implementation and the use of loan funds.
However, there was no progress in these areas. At the request of the
Government, US$10.0 million of loan funds were canceled on July 27, 1988.
Subsequently, the Government presented to the Bank possible alternatives to
revise the scope of the project including, inter-alia, the financing of
rural roads in other states and the financing within Chiapas of roads with
higher specifications than those originally agreed. The Bank did not find
these alternatives acceptable since they were not within the project
objectives. On May 30, 1988 the Government requested cancellation of
another US$10.0 million which was 'ostponed until the presentation to the
Bank of documentation to justify the use of funds in the Special Account.
On December 17, 1988, US$ 10.94 were canceled retroactive to May 30, 1988.



4 -
5.04     Loan funds amounting to US$1.06 million were disbursed under the
project. In fact, between 1984 and 1988 only 443km of rural roads were
constructed in Chiapas,2 and about 10OOkm were reconstructed or
rehabilitated. Although this amounts to about half of the appraisal
physical targets, only about 5% of the loan was disbursed. This is because
many of the works carried out did not have the documentation necessary for
Bank approval (i.e. economic evaluations and/or SEDUE's clearance regarding
the environmental impact of the road works (para. 1.13)) or were carried
out according to procurement practices not acceptable to the Bank. In
addition delay in sAbmitting documentation for disbursements eroded the
dollar equivalent of the expenditure:s made since, at the time, the Mexican
peso underwent a continuing process of devaluation.
5.05     The project adequately addressed the problem of protecting
Chiapas' unique ecological reserves. To that end, it was agreed to use
Mexico's established review process applicable to all construction works,
with the Secretariat for Urban Development and Ecology (SEDUE) acting as
the responsible agency. During project preparation, data on the initial
list of subprojects to be financed under the project was submitted to
SEDUE, and all but seven of those roads received clearance. The seven
roads which required further study were located in the Lagos de Montebello
National Park area. Although SCT-Chiapas continued requesting SEDUE's
opinion on these roads, SEDUE never responded to these requests. As
already discussed, lack of act4on on SEDUE's part also contributed to poor
project implementation.
6.       Project Impact and SustaliWhAWtv
6.01     The project financed the construction of about 443 km of rural
roads an6 road rehabilitation and improvements. The estimated ex-post
economic rate of return (ERR) for the road construction component is 13X as
compared to the 191 envisaged at appraisal. Ex-ante ERR's ranged from 5.7S
to 262%. The ex-post rates ranged from 8.31 to 37.21 (Part III, Table 6).
The less than expected returns are mostly ex-lained by the lack of
complementary agricultural services that were to have an important impact
on agricultural output. Because the institutional component of the project
never took off, its impact did not go beyond the limited on-the-job
training that the exposure to Bank evaluation techniques provided to the
staff in SCT-Chiapas. Sustainability of the project will depend on
Chiapas's efforts in rural roads maintenance. At present, road maintenance
is inadequate. But the Bank is considering a road project with heavy
emphasis on strengthening future road maintenance capability of the States.
As a result, future road maintenance may improve and positively affect the
sustainability of the Chiapas Rural Roads Project.
i Of these 443 km the Bain; '_nally provided financing for 241 km, or 23%
of the appraisal physical target. Delays in submitting documentation
for disbursements coupled with the process of continuing devaluation of
the Mexican peso eroded the dollar equivalent of the expenditures made
in those roads. As a result, Bank financing represented, in real
terms. approximately 26% of the estimated total cost of the 241 km of
roads.



5-
7.       Performance of the Borrower
7.01     Satisfactory project implementation would have required SCT-
Chiapas, the regional SCT office, to have an important role in data
gathering and project justification, tasks for which they were ill-
prepared. In this regard, SCT's Directorate General of Planning, could
have played a more active training and dissemination role. It should be
noticed.-however, that lack of experience in these matters could have been
a surmountable problem but the executing agency had very low incentives,
and many'disincentives to use loan funds. This was because the external
financing did not result in additional funding to the agency but was meant
to substitute Federal funding which was available with fewer strings
attached (i.e.: as regard project justification and procurement
requirements).
8.       Performance of the Bank
8.01     The Bank acted with relative innovativeness by helping to develop
the Plan Chiapas and supporting it through two independent but
complementary operatious that were processed in parallel. With hindsight,
it is clear that the project did not have across-the-board support from the
Government, mainly because of changed priorities and the perception that
the project's benefits were outweighed by the cumbersome procedures
required to implement it. It is difficult to ascertain, however, to what
extent it was possible for the Bank to realize that this was the case
during the project preparation stage. Once it became evident that the
project was not going to be implemented as originally envisaged, the Bank
pressed the Mexican Government to act promptly to cancel the loan and
provided the necessary assistance to streamlir.e the processing of the
information to maximize the disbursement of loan funds. On the other hand,
SARH continues to successfully implement, albeit with delays, the rural
roads component of the Chiapas Agricultural Development Project. To date
about 50% of the physical target has been reached.
8.02     The main lesson to be learned from the project is not a new one.
It relates to the need to ascertain, early in the project cycle, the strong
commitment of those dgencies and/or levels of technical staff that are in
the critical path of successful project implementation. In addition, the
Bank should try to balance the need to ensure the economic viability of the
project with the limited capability or those in charge of conducting the
studies to quantify it. Finally, from the moment the Borrower and the Bank
decided that the best course of action was to cancel the loan, two years
had elapsed until it was actually canceled. This was the result of the
time required ',y the different Government agencies involved (NAFIN, SCT,
the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit and the Secretariat of
Programming and Budgeting) to reach consensus Ofn the future of the project.
These delays probably reflected the Borrower's expectation that the project
could be turned around, but with hindsight there were no' objective reasons
to expect this.



- 6-
9.       Project Relationships
9.01      Throughout project preparation and implementation, relations
between the Bank and the Borrower were always excellent. The Borrower and
SCT, however, always made clear that they felt the Bank had to relax its
conditions for subproject approval, citing it as the main reason for lack
of project progress. The Bank, on the other hand, was of the opinion that
the problem of project evaluation, even when it existed, was a surmountable
one. The fact that SCT was able to justify the inclusion under the project
of works in several road links, seem to support the Bank's position.

PART II
PROJECT REVIEW FROM BORROWER'S PERSPECTIVE
I. Introduction
1.01     In order to identify strategies to adequately develop the State of
Chiapas, the Mexican Government, supported by the World Bank, in 1981
started to review the social and economic problems affecting the State.
The studies resulted in the design of a development plan called 'Plan
Chiapas", that was adopted in May 1983. From such Plan, two elements were
selected as priorities that translated into World Bank projects, with
financing made possible by foreign loans: an agricultural development
project and a rural roads development and rehabilitation project.
1.02     The proposed rural roads project would provide a basis for direct
growth in the State of Chiapas. Its implementation was to be consistent
with agricultural development, and with the objective of strengthening the
social and economic aspects of the State.
1.03     Nevertheless, carrying out the project required substantial
budgetary support, which, because of the economic crisis affecting the
country, mainly due to the drop in oil prices, was not possible. This
resulted in the project's goals not being met, and remaining very much
below the planned levels. Compounding budgetary limitations were an untold
number of operational-type problems that inhibited the optimal use of
scarce available resources.
1.04     The above-cited resulted in only Mex$2,703.2 million being
considered for financing from Loan 2525-ME, of a total of Mex$4,859.5
million spent on the program, i.e. 56% of the total amount susceptible of
financing under the project. However, it is important to note that the
entities involved in project implementation always attempted to provide
their best effort. There was no way to anticipate the problems, which will
be described later, that came up during the execution of the project.
Perhaps the answer to future problems of this kind would be to provide
adequate training to all staff involved in handling foreign credits, but
especially to those who will be implementing externally-financed projects.
1.05     This report is based on Bank Aide-Memoires, various documents
submitted to the World Bank on the "Plan Chiapas", a Project Evaluation
Report, the General Agreements on IBRD loans, the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements, and the Letter signed by the World Bank, dated May 24, 1984.

II. Proiect Identification. Preparation and Appraisal
2.01     Road construction, besides achieving the objective of linking
communities, implies that populations will come out of isolation and start
an integrated development through education, health, trade, industry,
agriculture, tourism, and public services. Roads provide agriculture a
larger geographic access, i.e., agricultural products are no longer
exclusively for local consumption but can be consumed at regional and
national levels, and even be exported. Roads also serve to exploit the
riches of forestry and the safe and timely transport of production inputs,
reflecting an accelerated rate of increase in production.
2.02     The Chiapas Plan was specifically designed to achieve adequate
development for the State and regarded as a priority the construction and
rehabilitation of road infrastructure. Thus, with the purpose of
supporting the implementation of the "Chiapas Plan", and therefore of co-
operating with the State Government for the State's economic development --
mainly in the agricultural area -- in 1982 the Federal Government started
negotiations with the World Bank to obtain loans to financially support the
Program. The result were two complementary loans: one to develop new
agricultural areas, with the Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic
Resources as the responsible agency, and the other one to construct and
rehabilitate rural roads in the State, with the Secretariat of
Communications and Transport (SCT) as the responsible agency. These
projects were executed independently.
2.03     The economic feasibility studies and the reports required by the
World Bank for approval of the loan were carried out by the Commission or
State Planning and Development (COPLADE), the General Planning Directorate
(formerly the General Directorate on Investment Analysis), and the
project's implementing agencies. The studies, carried out for the Bank,
amounted to seven volumes with technical and economic feasibility
information on the proposed project to be financed by the Bank.
Nevertheless, the World Bank requested additional information on the
parameters used in the assessment of works, as well as specific
authorization from the Urban Development Department for some projects, as
communicated in a letter dated May 24, 1984, and in other subsequent
documents.
2.04     The studies showed a program of construction works on 244 roads
for the period 1984-88, at a cost of Mex$19,070 million -- in constant 1984
prices -- to construct 2,790 km.
2.05     However, with the economic crisis faced by the couutry there was a
progressive loss of interest in the infrastructure construction program as
policies to allocate resources changed -- higher priority was given to the
maintenance and rehabilitation of existing infrastructure. Only
Mex$1,434.1 million at constant 1984 prices were earmarked for the project,
allowing the construction of only 444.3 km of the total planned, i.e., 7.5%
in financial terms, and 15.9% in physical terms of the total planned,
respectively.



- 9 -
2.06     Compounding the already mentioned problems, the process undertaken
during each loan phase was slow and difficult. This is obvious in the long
negotiation and identification period (at least three years), contracting,
loan effectiveness (nine months) and the execution period (two and a half
years), during which it was possible to disburse only 4.8% from the loan.
2.07     It is important to note the above as lessons to avoid future
project failures. In this regard, the Federal Government should authorize
pluriannual investment programs when funded with foreign loans. It would
also be desirable that the commitments to be entered into adhere more to
the ways in which the project implementing agency works, or that, in any
case, before entering into a commitment in which extraordinary work, are
required, both parties ensure that the necessary infrastructure to
adequately comply with the commitment has been implemented.
2.08     We are aware of the World Bank's intentions in optimizing planning
and programming of the resources and needs of the beneficiaries of its
loans. However, to undertake each program the required planning should be
consistent with existing budgetary limitations. Therefore, it is necessary
for the Bank to be more flexible, especially with this type of loans which
have economic and social implications and whose main objective is the
development of the poorer areas of the country. Their main goal, thus, is
social benefit.
4.09     It is important to note that, as the requirements set by the World
Bank become more consistent with the implementing agency's ability to
respond, the projects will be more realistic.
III. Project Description
3.01     The objective of the project was to promote the development of the
State of Chiapas through the improvement of a rural roads network. The
subprojects were selected on the basis of technical, economic, and social
criteria, and were supplemented by various general guidelines. The parts
encompassed by the project are detailed as follows:
3.02     PART A:  Subprojects for:  (i) the construction of approximately
1,000 km of rural roads; (ii) rehabilitation or improvement of
approximately 2,000 km of rural roads; and (iii) engineering studies.
PART B: Technical support to strengthen the implementing
capabilities of the Secretariat of Communications and Transport and
COPLADE:  (i) with the objective of carrying out planning studies on
transport investments, including, for instance, the development of a road
master plan; and (ii) to carry out construction and maintenance works, and
the preparation and updating of manuals related to rural roads construction
and maintenance.
3.03     In addition, the following actions were agreed with the World
Bank: (i) all road construction would be authorized by the Urban
Development and Ecology Department, to avoid, as much as possible,



- 10 -
ecological damages; (ii) yearly updating of the rural roads inventory and
SCT's programs in order to prioritize their reconstruction and periodic
maintenance; (iii) to prepare a study on passenger and cargo transport in
the rural environment -- the main conclusions of which would serve as basis
for implementing actions to improve rural transport; (iv) to present to the
World Bank a pilot project on road sections on which bunds and surfacing be
compacted, and including purchase of equipment when made by force account,
and a second alternative considering the execution of this test by
contract. Data obtained on these trial sections would be made available to
other States in order to analyze the feasibility and cinvenience of
implementation in the road programs.
3.04     However, the lack of resources made it impossible to carry out any
of the above-mentioned studies.
3.05     Along these lines, and with the objective of achieving the goals
of the project, it was estimated that an annual investment equivalent to
US$6 million was required, exclusively for the program financed with
foreign credits. This goal was never reached. Glcbal investment during
the period 1984-1988 averaged US$2.21 million per year, which obviously was
not enough to reach the goals set in the project.
3.06     Described below are the estimated investments and goals, according
to the Appraisal Report, for the program financed with Loan 2525-ME'

3.07     According to the table above, the Mexican Government should have
invested, up to 1988, the equivalent of US$32 million in the externally
funded program. However, only US$11.8 million was allocated for the rural
road program as a whole.
3.08     From the appraisal expected total project cost, i.e., US$41.7
million, the World Bank would finance the equivalent of US$22 million,
approximately 50% of the cost. The following disbursements were estimated.

disbursed by 1988. However, only US$1.06 million was reached, i.e., 9.6%
of the estimated disbursements.
IV. Project ImRlementation
4.01     The Loan and Guarantee Agreements for the Project were signed on
July 16, 1985, and the Loan became effective on April 4, 1986 when the
Coordination Agreement between the Secretariat of Budgeting and
Programming, the Secretariat of Agriculture and Hydraulic Resources, the
Secretariat of Communicatiouis and Transport, and the State Government of
Chiapas was signed.
4.02     The amount contracted with the Bank to finance this project
reached US$22.0 million, allocated as follows: US$16.5 million to finance
50% of the cost of civil works, US$1.5 million to finance 100% of the cost
of technical assistance and consulting services, and US$4.0 million for
contingencies.
4.03     During project expcution there were different problems, notably
the budgetary shortfall, which affected the attainment of the estimated
goals. Additionally, other operational problems that had a negative impact
on adequate loan execution were, among others:
(a)   Inadequate coordination among those involved during project
execution.
(b)   Confusion as to the requirements for making loan disbursements.
(c)   Lack of training by the project executors, especially on the
adequate presentation of documentation to review project
eligibility and verification of expenses.
(d)   Lack of coordination with the Urban Development and Ecology
Department to obtain the authorization requested by the Bank in
the case of rural roads in areas where the environment was going
to suffer an adverse impact.
4.04     It is clear that the main obstacle for using the loan was the low
budget.  Thus, the Government's decision to cancel part of the loan was
considered right. That cancellation was done in two stages: the first



- 12 -
(US$10 million dollars) on July 27, 1987. A series of actions were
proposed at this first stage, with a view to optimizing the use of the
remainder of the loan and are described below:
(a)    To increase the Bank's financing share from 50% to 70% or 80%.
(b)    To include works with higher design standards of construction than
those eligible for financing under thec loan, as well as high-cost
roads executed in the State of Chiapas.
(c)    To include construction and rehabilitation of rural roads in other
States of the Country.
4.05     Bank missions opposed these proposals, especially that of section
"c", because they felt that it was not within the objectives of the
project.
4.06     Thus, facing the imminent impossibility of allocating enough
resources to the individual project in the short term, a decision was made
to disburse the maximum amount possible, using the existing documentation
for eligible expenditures incurred up to that moment, and to cancel the
remainder that could not be disbursed. In this sense, only US$1.06 million
was used, approximately 50% of what could have been financed.
4.07     The above implies that the original project did iLot consider the
possibility that the project's implementing agency would have enough
resources available. Also, approval was granted to a project for which
there was still the need to comply with many information requirements, as
was made known in a letter dated May 21, 1984, and subsequent documents;
for instance, SEDUE's authorization for construction works, the
presentation of adequate economic evaluations, and confirmation on the
economic potential of the project's area of influence.
4.08     As to the execution of the loan, in the presentation (March-April
1987) of the initially agreed documentation to disburse funds, which
consisted of preparing SOE's endorsed by the Chief of the SCT Center in
Chiapas, certain inconsistencies were found in the correspondence received
by the financial agent such as double reporting of expenses, presentation
of expenses for projects that were not accepted to be financed, and amounts
that included the Value Added Tax. As a consequence, it was agreed to
suspend withdrawals from the Special Account until that information was
clarified.
4.9      In view of the situation, implementation of new mechanisms, with
the intention of defining and supporting the report of incurred expenses
was attempted. One of these mechanisms was to coordinate among the
agencies involved, but it did not reach the desired objectives.
4.10     As a second option it was decided to compile all the supporting
documentation of the expenses report, under the responsibility of the
executing agency and the SCT-Chiapas Center. Once the documentation was
compiled, problems still persisted -- there were some cases of incomplete
documentation and, in the judgment of the financial agent, did not meet the
minimur requirements to be eligible for financing.



- 13 -
4.11     Finally, a decision was made to form a working group consisting of
IBRD, SCT's Directorate General of Planning, SCT's Chiapas Center and
NAFIN, which travelled to the project area. There, the available
information was analyzed and clarified, and a determination of what could
be funded by the Bank was made.
4.12     Given the latter experience, it is desirable that for future
loans, enough time and care should be exercised to svoid these types of
problems, which apparently are of no great importance, but that without
adequate training and minimum care, can evolve into serious situations. By
the same token, it is important to consider the possibility of implementing
periodic training seminars, at least up to the implementation of each
specific project, which are aimed at direct project executors, so that each
loan's specific guidelines and key points are known and can be given
greater emphasis.
4.13     External loans should be executed with greater efficiency.  To
that end, periodic coordination among the institutions involved should be
increased and the need to implement an adequate structure to handle foreign
credit in the executing institutions should be analyzed.
V. Economic Reevaluation
5.01     The economic analysis of a road project is focused on quantifying
its inherent benefits and costs. Traditionally, such quantification was
related to monetary savings, brought by the project to the user in the form
of reduced operational and travel time. However, that type of emphasis is
inadequate to analyze rural roads on which traffic volumes are very low.
Therefore, the analysis should be based on the impact each road has on its
area of influence, especially in promoting agricultural production
development thus increasing the level of income of the population directly
involved with it.
5.02     The road's area of influence is defined as a function of its
localization, as follows:
(a)   From 3 to 5 km on each side of the road axis, on flat terrain.
(b)   From 2 to 4 km on each side of the road axis, on hilly terrain.
(c)   From 1 to 3 km on each side of the road axis, on mountainous
terrain.
5.03     The economic evaluation of each project is based mainly on its
impact on agricultural production, considering that it is the most
sensitive sector and easier to quantify. The methodology employed
encompasses three variations, as follows:
1.    First year benefit.  If it was higher than or equal to 12%, the
project was considered to be profitable. If not, the second
method, as follows, was used.



- 14 -
2.    Net present value.  Under this method, incremental agricultural
output was considered for the 10 years of the project's useful
life.
If the result was negative, the third method was used.
3.    Cost per inhabitant served -  Total Road Cost          less US$450
Number of inhabitants than
served
5.04     The evaluation was done using a sample encompassing 72% of the
executed projects. The result was that the projects were economically
viable, according to the method first defined. Values obtained
demonstrate, for the most part, that the projects were executed with
delays.
VI. Conclusions and Recommendations
6.01     It is evident that, for both the Mexican Government and the World
Bank, the lessons learned from this Loan have highlighted several issues
that will have to be addressed soon, to improve the performance of World
Bank loans.
6.02     As a result, the following findings and recommendations,
considered to be the most important are presented:
1.   Even when it was impossible to complete the project according to
the initial estimations, it remained fully justified, as
demonstrated by the results of the economic reevaluation.
2.   The main problem hampering project execution was lack of resources
due to the economic crisis affecting the country during the
1984-1988 period.
3.   For future loans, it is recommended that the Government makes sure
to have enough national resources available on a timely basis. To
that end, prioritized Pluriannual Investment Programs should be
agreed upon among participating State Secretariats with a view to
guaranteeing the timely disbursement of external loans, thus
strengthening the inflow of hard currency into the country.
4.   It is necessary to provide training for staff in charge of
external loans, especially in those agencies initiating the
execution of a loan. Periodic seminars should be carried out to
provide established guidelines for the execution of external
loans.
5.       Projects with external financing should be provided with timely
local funds, so that the Institution having the responsibility of
implementing them will be able to comply with the established minimum
periods for bids and would greatly improve the programming of civil works.
