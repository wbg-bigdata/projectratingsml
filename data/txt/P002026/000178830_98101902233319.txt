INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO NIGERIA FOR THE GOMBE
AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to Nigeria for the equivalent of US$21 million to help finance agricultural
development in the Gombe area in the North Eastern State of Nigeria. The
loan would have a term of 20 years including a five-year grace period with
an interest of 8 percent per annum. Of the US$21 million Bank loan, US$20.6
million would be onlent to the North Eastern State Government (NES), and
US$0.4 million would be retained by the Federal Government. The Loan would
be onlent on the same terms as the Bank loan.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Current Economic Position and Prospects of Nigeria"
(416a-UNI) dated August 5, 1974 was distributed to the Executive Directors.
The country data sheet is attached as Annex I.
Recent Developments
3.        The most striking feature of Nigeria's economic performance since
1970 is the remarkably rapid recovery from the dislocations and disruptions
caused by the civil war. GDP rose by nearly 50 percent in the two years
immediately following the war.   This exceptionally high growth obviously
included a large element of "catching-up" as the economy responded to the pent-
up demands of the civil war period and as investment and production which had
been postponed during the hostilities were rapidly realized. As this phase
came to a close, a decline in the rate of growth to more normal levels was
to be expected. Moreover, during 1972 and 1973, agricultural production was
adversely affected by drought in the Northern States, and the output of some
manufacturing industries (e.g., textiles and footwear) fell as a result of
intensified competition from imports, following the policy of liberalization
introduced in early 1972. As a result, GDP at factor cost is estimated to have
risen by about 8 percent in 1972/73. Growth in 1973/74 may be in the range of
6-7 percent. The country's GDP during 1970/71 through 1972/73 was about 45
percent higher than in the three years immediately preceding the war. The
implied growth rate during the period 1964-66 to 1970-72 (6.3 percent a year)
compares favorably with the 6 percent attained during the fifties and early
sixties.
4.        This rapid economic recovery resulted mainly from expansion of
petroleum mining. Crude oil production rose from around 630,000 barrels per
day (bbls/day) in early 1970 to 1.8 million bbls/day in early 1972 and 2.0
million bbls/day by mid-1973. Government services too increased quickly on
the basis of considerable growth of revenues from the oil sector. On the



average, manufactures also grew faster than total output. However, petro-
leum production is an enclave activity, and manufacturing and modern services
afford employment for a small share of the labor force. Nigeria essentially
remains an agricultural economy in spite of a substantial shift in the com-
position of output since the period immediately before the civil war. Agri-
culture accounted for 46 percent of domestic product in 1971/72 (i.e., prior
to the increase in oil prices) and employed some 70 percent of the labor force.
Consequently, Nigeria's per capita income (about $130 in 1972) largely reflects
the low productivity of its traditional agriculture.
5.        The considerable growth of domestic product and income in recent
years was accompanied by similar increases in all major components of aggre-
gate expenditure. In real terms, exports in the period 1971/72 through 1973/74
averaged about twice the pre-war levels, imports increased by almost 90 per-
cent, investment by over 65 percent, and consumption expenditures by about
50 percent. Per capita real consumption and the rate of investment are well
above pre-war levels. Private sector investments have been high in both oil
and non-oil activities, especially manufacturing among the latter. Public
investment (valued at 1970/71 prices) rose from N148 million in 1970/71 to
N340 million in 1972/73 and was budgetted at N600 million in 1973/74. Never-
theless, implementation of the public investment program contained in the
Second Development Plan is behind schedule, due partly to a delay of ten
months in the issuance of the Plan and, more significantly, to inadequate
executive capacity for project preparation and implementation. Recognizing
these problems, the Government decided to postpone the start of the next Plan
by a year. The Third Development Plan is now scheduled to start early in 1975,
and will cover the five-year period 1975-80. Provisional guidelines for the
Third Plan, issued in July 1973, are currently being reviewed in the light of
the new situation brought about by the recent sharp rise in oil revenues.
General Gowan's Independence Day message of October 1, 1974, indicates that
the Government is now contemplating a much bigger program of investment than
outlined in the July 1973 Guidelines.
6.        Nigeria's balance of payments and fiscal position have also shown
dramatic improvement essentially because of the rapid growth of petroleum
exports. Total exports have risen from N885 million in 1970 to N2,227 million
in 1973, with oil accounting for practically all the increase. Imports have
also grown (from N756 million in 1970 to N1,234 million in 1973), but more
slowly than exports. This has enabled the Government to reduce short-term
external debt and to progressively relax the restrictions on import payments
and repatriation of dividends. The few remaining licensing and payment
controls in respect of goods and factor services have been removed in the
last budget. Foreign exchange reserves have increased dramatically following
the recent increases in oil price, and preliminary figures as of early October
1974 indicate that external reserves exceed $4 billion, equivalent to about
15 months' imports.
7.        The increase in oil revenues from N70 million in 1969/70 to N730
million in 1972/73 was also the major factor in transforming the Government's



-3-
fiscal position. In 1969/70, the Federal and State budgets taken together
showed an overall deficit of N349 million; in 1971/72, they showed an overall
surplus of N268 million. Because of a sharp increase in expenditures, 1972/73
recorded a small overall deficit. But the recent rise in oil prices is likely
to result in an unprecedented overall surplus during 1973/74 and the current
year despite big increases in budgetted expenditures. This growing fiscal
strength, however, has been largely confined, so far, to the Federal Govern-
ment. In general, the states have been barely able to balance their revenue
leaving little resources to finance capital expenditures. The Federal Govern-
ment has made large grants and low interest loans to alleviate the situation.
The picture is likely to change dramatically as a result of the new revenue-
sharing arrangement announced by General Gowan in his Independence Day address.
Under the new arrangement, the states as a group are expected to have suffi-
cient resources to meet all their current expenditures and about two-thirds
of the projected capital expenditures.
8.        The improved budgetary situation, liberalization of imports and
recovery of production in the eastern states have, together, helped abate
inflationary pressures. The Lagos Consumer Price Index rose by less than 3
percent in 1972 and a little over 4 percent in 1973, compared to an average
of 13 percent or more per annum between 1968 and 1971.
9.        Other major developments in the last two years include a far-
reaching reform of the Marketing Board System, a substantial increase in
producer prices for agricultural products, the acquisition of a 55 percent
equity participation in virtually all foreign operations in the oil sector,
and the establishment of the Bank for Commerce and Industry to assist in-
digenous entrepreneurs. A population census, conducted in November-December
1973, indicates Nigera's population to be around 80 million. These results
are provisional and subject to review by a Committee of Experts. The final
population figures are not expected before the end of the current year. At
the political level, the most noteworthy event is the announcement of the
Federal Military Government's decision to postpone the return to civilian
rule, originally set for 1976.
Medium and Long-Term Prospects
10.       Even before the recent rise in oil prices, as pointed out in the
Basic Economic Report (Report No. AW-35a), it was apparent that the resources
generated by oil would permit Nigeria to undertake a bold program of public
development expenditures and plan for a sustained, rapid growth during the
next decade. The Guidelines for the Third Plan issued in July 1973 visualized
total public investment at some 80 percent higher than in the Second Plan
with emphasis on agriculture and rural development and on widening and deepen-
ing the industrial structure. With the prospect of vastly larger oil revenues,
the Government has decided to further increase the scale of projected invest-
ments. The Head of State recently announced that the public sector investment
program in the Third Plan would be about N20 billion, out of an estimated
total investment of N30 billion. This is expected to generate a 9 percent
annual increase in incomes. Apart from larger outlays in agriculture, roads,



- 4 -
education, health and infrastructure, massive investments in oil-related
industries like LNG, fertilizers and refineries are visualized. The need and
scope for the projected investments is beyond doubt. The finance and foreign
exchange necessary to sustain them are also available. The Government is aware
that shortage of executive capacity poses a serious problem, and efforts are
being made to overcome this constraint. Clearly the fulfillment of the Third
Plan targets depends critically on the success in building up the necessary
capacity to prepare, implement and manage projects.
11.       The Bank's Economic Mission, reviewing Nigeria's medium and long-
term growth prospects in the light of the new oil prices, estimated that,
with oil prices remaining constant in real terms, oil output rising moderately
and public expenditures growing at the rate of 13 percent a year (in real
terms), the economy has the potential to sustain an average annual growth of
over 9 percent through the mid-eighties, provided the investment program is
implemented efficiently. The potential growth would be somewhat lower (8.3
percent a year) if oil prices in real terms were to decline moderately, oil
output were kept constant and public expenditures grew by only 10-11 percent
a year. Even with such high rates of growth, Nigeria in the mid-eighties
would still be a relatively poor country with per capita real income of
around $500.
12.       Under the above assumptions, Nigeria is expected to remain in over-
all balance of payments surplus during the remainder of the 1970s. Accumu-
lated reserves at the end of the Third Plan (1980/81) may lie in the vicinity
of 18 months' import value, the value of imports having risen by that time
to around $13 billion in terms of current prices. However, the overall balance
of payments is likely to be in deficit by the early eighties, and the deficit
could rise rapidly. The range of possible outcomes during the eighties is
very wide and will be very sensitive to the behavior of oil prices, output
and public expenditures. With relatively low growth of public expenditure,
constant real oil prices and rising oil output, total reserves in 1985/86
could be equivalent to less than 10 months' imports. But, with higher growth
of government expenditures, lower oil prices and constant oil production,
Nigeria could well have exhausted all its reserves by that time.
External Assistance
13.       Nigeria's need for external assistance to help accelerate invest-
ment in the more intractable areas such as agriculture and rural development
and to increase executive and managerial capacity in the infrastructure
sectors is the more urgent as the country's resources increase. The Federal
Government's attitude towards foreign private capital is that it should com-
plement, not compete with domestic capital. This applies to official exter-
nal assistance as well. Priority is, therefore, being given to multilateral
and bilateral projects and programs which act as catalysts to investment
efforts in the high priority areas and increase indigenous capability to
control, manage and promote the growth of the economy efficiently in the
future. Against this background the Federal government and the Bank agree
that, at least over the next Plan period (1975-1980), the primary objective



-5-
of Bank activities in Nigeria should continue to be to assist Government
efforts to increase investment in the high priority areas of agricultural
and rural infrastructure development and to improve public sector capability
to manage and promote the future growth of the modern sectors, rather than
to increase available resources. During recent discussions with the Govern-
ment, it was also agreed that the most efficient and effective means of
providing this assistance would be in association with capital projects
typically financed by the Bank, such as the projects proposed today.
14.       Nigeria's creditworthiness for additional borrowing on conventional
terms is not in question. As of December 31, 1972, total external public and
publicly guaranteed debt, including undisbursed loans, amounted to an estimated
$1,035 million, of which approximately $57 million represented suppliers'
credits. Outstanding but undisbursed commitments of official capital were
about $426 million. Debt service in 1972 was 2.5 percent of gross exports, or
less than 4 percent of exports less factor payments. In view of the substan-
tially improved resource position of the country, and the consequent uncer-
tainty as to the level of its future borrowings, it would not be possible to
state, at this stage, what the Bank's share of Nigeria's total outstanding
debt or debt service will be in the next five years. The Bank Group's share
of total external public debt (including undisbursed) at the end of 1972 was
about 45 percent. This relatively high share essentially reflects Nigeria's
low level of external debt ($14 per capita in 1972) rather than substantial
lending by the Bank ($6 per capita, including undisbursed, at the end of 1972).
15.       The Government of Nigeria is favorably inclined to re-cycle a
portion of its accumulating resources for the benefit of the developing
world. During the past six months, Nigeria has increased its subscription
to the African Development Bank and announced that it will no longer seek
to borrow from that institution; donated $800,000 to the Consultative Group
for International Agricultural Research, thus becoming the first developing
country to contribute to the Group; and contributed SDR100 million to the IMF
Oil Facility. In addition, Nigeria has recently agreed to make a substantial
purchase of Bank bonds, the terms of which are currently under negotiation.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN NIGERIA
16.       Bank/IDA lending to Nigeria to date amounts to $621.9 million (net
of cancellations) of which $370.8 million was committed during the period of
the Second National Development Plan. Transport and power together account
for $428.2 million or about 69 percent of the total, and agriculture, educa-
tion, industry and the post-war rehabilitation loan account for the remaining
31 percent; excluding the program loan, the respective shares are about 75
percent for transport and power and 25 percent for the other three sectors.
Although disbursements have been lagging, the execution of projects has gen-
erally been satisfactory. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans
and IFC investments and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.



-6-
17.       Bank activities since 1970 have generally been aimed at assisting
Nigeria in the following three broad areas: (a) reconstruction and rehabili-
tation of the economy after the civil war; (b) institution-building in the
public sector; and (c) extensive economic, sector and project preparation
work. In pursuance of these aims, Bank commitments in FYs 1971, 1972, 1973
and 1974 amounted to $97.2 million, $119.6 million, $54 million and $75
million, respectively; during the same period, an economic mission and agri-
culture, education and transportation sector missions visited Nigeria; and
extensive assistance was provided to the State Governments in identifying and
perparing projects designed to raise the production and incomes of small
farmers.
18.       The proposed project, and the four other projects under considera-
tion today, reflect the increasing emphasis being given to agriculture and
rural development in the Federal Government's plans for investing oil revenues
for the benefit of the bulk of the population who live in rural areas. Nego-
tiations with the Bank have been completed for three further agricultural
projects directed towards raising the production of palm oil from nucleus
estates and smallholdings in the Western, Mid-Western and East Central States.
Other projects in an advanced state of processing will be concerned with small-
holder rubber production in the Mid-Western State and an irrigation scheme
near Kano, and work is underway on the preparation of two further rural develop-
ment projects, similar to those being presented today, in the Benue Plateau and
Kwara States in the center of the country. These last four projects should be
ready for presentation to Executive Directors within the next eighteen months.
Outside agriculture the activities of the Bank Group are being restricted over
the next few years to a small number of projects for which the Federal Govern-
ment has requested assistance in building up new institutions required to
strengthen essential infrastructure and to provide employment for the rapidly
growing urban population. Work is currently proceeding on the preparation of
projects for small-scale industry and water supply and sewerage in small towns
and rural areas. The possibility of Bank assistance in the reorganization of
the telecommunications sector has been discussed, but no decision has been
taken. No further lending is presently envisaged for highways, power or
education which have been important areas of Bank Group involvement in the
past. Hlowever, two education projects are still at an early stage of imple-
mentation, and their supervision will make considerable demands on the time
of Bank staff. The work of the Bank's Resident Mission in Lagos is largely
concentrated on project preparation in agriculture and public utilities and
on the supervision of on-going projects in these and other sectors.
19.       Since foreign exchange as such is no longer a scarce resource in
Nigeria, the extent of the Bank's participation in the financing of individual
projects is being determined more by reference to what is considered to be an
appropriate share of total costs.  For projects which have high priority in
meeting basic economic and social problems such as those in agriculture and
rural development, where the direct foreign exchange component may also be
relatively low, the Bank has been financing 50% of total costs, and this is
the formula proposed for the sharing of costs of the five projects under
consideration today and the three other projects for which loans have already



-7-
been negotiated. In the case of four of the five projects under consideration
today the foreign exchange component ranges between 47 and 51%; for the Rice
project it is 30%. This cost-sharing formula will be re-examined before
further negotiations take place.
20.       During the five years since the end of the civil war in January
1970, Bank Group commitments to Nigeria have averaged about $80 million a
year.  Disbursements on Bank loans to Nigeria have lagged well behind commit-
ments. During the current fiscal year, they are not expected to exceed $54
million on a gross basis, or $18 million net of interest and principal repay-
ments to the Bank. A large increase in the level of lending was discussed
with the Nigerian Government wo years ago when it was assumed that Nigeria
would continue to require a substantial inflow of external capital for financ-
ing investments in the power and transport sectors which had absorbed the
bulk of previous Bank loans. Now that these requirements can be met from
Nigeria's own resources, the level and direction of Bank lending in future
years will have to be reviewed in the context of the country's new Five-Year
Plan, and such a review is planned for April or May next year when the Govern-
ment expects discussions on the Plan to have been completed.
PART III - AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NIGERIA
21.       Agriculture, including livestock, fisheries and forestry is by
far the most important source of output and employment: in 1971/72 it
contributed about $4 billion or 46 percent of the country's gross domestic
product and about 70 percent of the labor force is estimated to be employed
in this sector.
22.       Nigerian agriculture is primarily domestic market oriented. Nearly
90 percent of her production - comprising all staple food crops and animal
products, most palm oil and cotton, and a substantial part of groundnuts - is
consumed within the country. Nigeria is nearly self-sufficient in foods.
In 1971-72, total imports of food and beverages - of which meat, milk and
sugar are the main items - were of the order of $145 million or less than
5 percent of estimated total food consumption. Exports of agricultural
products in 1971-72 were valued at $265 million. Until the mid-sixties, they
were the dominant element in Nigeria's export trade, but have since been over-
taken by crude oil. Even so, they are still a significant source of foreign
exchange and account for the bulk of the non-oil exports.
23.       Nigeria can be divided into three major agricultural and ecolog-
ical zones; a southern wet forest zone comprising the Western, Mid-Western,
East-Central, South-Eastern and Rivers States, characterized by high rainfall
and a tropical climate and growing mainly perennial tree crops, namely cocoa,
rubber and oil palm; a central dry forest zone known as the middle belt
embracing the whole of Kwara State, Benue Plateau, the southern parts of
North-Western, North-Central and North-Eastern States which is underpopulated



- 8-
and tsetse infested, but has a high potential for annual food crops and live-
stock; and a northern zone which, being free from tsetse has a high population
density and a fairly intensive and developed system of agriculture. This area
covers about 50 percent of the country, and in addition to supporting most of
Nigeria's cattle population, also produces most of her cereals, beans, ground-
nuts and cotton.
24.       Land holdings are typically small.   The average farmed area per
holding for the country as a whole is estimated to be less than three
acres. In some of the more densely populated areas of the south, the
average is less than one acre. There are few farm families with more than
25 acres of cultivated area. Farmers follow for the most part traditional
techniques of which bush fallowing and mixed cropping are characteristic
features. The practice of bush fallowing is essentially a device to main-
tain soil fertility. Mixed cropping permits farmers to get more output
per acre with smaller risks of crop failure. However, since improved seed,
fertilizers and other elements of modern technology are used on a very
limited scale, average yields are still low. Small holdings and poor produc-
tivity explain the relatively low level of income in the agricultural sector.
There are also considerable disparities in the distribution of land and
incomes both between and within regions.
25.       While reliable data are lacking, it is believed that agricultural
production since the early sixties has been growing only slightly faster
than population. Agriculture has certainly been growing much slower than
other sectors, and as a result, its share in GDP has been declining. The
relative sluggishness of agriculture is largely attributable to the exist-
ing low level of agricultural technology. The disruption of production in
the eastern states during the civil war was an aggravating factor. Since
then, the recovery has been hampered by short-term factors such as drought
in parts of the north in 1972-73 and 1973-74, but, more particularly, by
a number of underlying long-term influences. Some of the most important
factors among these are the rising age-profile of tree crops, technical and
other constraints to accelerated food crop production, e.g., the lack of
improved crop varieties and adequate credit facilities to finance the pur-
chase of modern farm inputs. Imports of food, though still small, have
risen from around $70 million in 1965-66 to $145 million in 1972. The slow
growth of production has also affected exports. Cocoa and rubber exports
have remained stagnant in recent years. Palm oil exports have dwindled to
negligible amounts and palm kernel exports are stagnating at well below
pre-war levels. Groundnut exports in 1972 were some 80 percent below the
1965 level and were even lover in 1973 because of the drought in the north.
In addition the availability of groundnuts for export has been affected by
substitution of groundnut for palm oil in domestic consumption and the rela-
tively better price offered to farmers by private traders. A near record
groundnut crop is in prospect for 1974. Cotton, once a major export, is now
fully utilized by the local textile industry and local supply cannot meet
demand.
26.       A vigorous effort to step-up the growth of agricultural and live-
stock production is essential for viable development of the economy. The



-9-
demand for agricultural products is growing rapidly. On a rough estimate,
the resources generated by the oil sector would be adequate to sustain a
growth rate of over 9 percent per annutm in real terms over the next decade.
This will generate a 6 percent average annual increase in domestic demand
for farm products. Unless the rate of agricultural growth is accelerated,
the economy faces the prospect of large and increasing food imports. More
importantly, continued slow growth of agricultural production implies a
slow improvement in the living conditions of the mass of the population with
the attendant risks of further aggravation of rural-urban disparities.
27.       Nigeria has vast unexploited potential for increasing agricultural
production.  The productivity of practically all segments of agriculture -
food, export crops, and livestock - are far below levels attainable with
modern farming methods. In addition there are extensive.areas of good agri-
cultural and grazing land which, if developed along scientific lines, could
greatly increase production. While improved varieties and techniques adapted
to local conditions are not available for all crops and regions, much can be
done on the basis of existing knowledge. Significant improvements in pro-
ductivity of many of the major export and cereal crops have been demonstrated
to be technically and economically feasible. The main constraints are organi-
zational and institutional: until recently Government efforts to help the
farmers to learn and apply the known techniques for raising production have
not been on a scale commensurate with needs and possibilities. Extension
services in many states are poorly staffed, credit and marketing institutions
are few, planning is weak and the expertise needed to implement successfully
major agricultural and other rural development projects is in short supply.
There are also complex social and institutional problems to be overcome before
the land potential, including the resources of the middle belt, can be effec-
tively exploited, and the livestock industry organized along modern lines.
28.       The Federal and State Governments are conscious of the need for
greater attention to agriculture and of the impediments to be overcome before
significant progress can be achieved. Several major new programs initiated
within the last year or two bear witness to a heightened Government concern
for and interest in agricultural development. These include the creation of
the Nigerian Agricultural Bank, the launching of an accelerated food produc-
tion program, larger and better organized projects for replanting/plianting of
tree crops and integrated agricultural development projects in different
parts of the country. At the request of the Government, the Bank has actively
assisted in the preparation of many of these projects. The Bank economic
mission in 1973 made an overall survey of the potential and prospects for
food production. Agriculture and rural development generally are of crucial
importance to Nigeria's long-term growth, and the Bank plans to continue
assisting Nigeria in preparing and implementing projects in this area.
PART IV - TIE PROJECT
29.       A Report entitled "Appraisal of Gombe Agricultural Development
Project - Nigeria" dated September 6, 1974 (No. 367a-UNI) is being distributed



- 10 -
separately. A loan and project summary is attached as Annex III, as is a
map showing the location of the project.
30.       The proposed project was identified by a Bank mission in November
1972, and was subsequently prepared by the Bank in collaboration with the
North Eastern State authorities. The project was appraised by a Bank mission
that visited Nigeria in September and October 1973. Negotiations were con-
ducted in Washington in July, 1974. The Nigerian delegation was led by Alhaji
Abubakar Alhaji, Deputy Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Finance.
Project Description
31.       The project area covers 5,300 km   and comprises three districts in
the Gombe emirate, a part of West Tangale, Waja and Kaltungo Districts, all
within the Gombe Administrative Division of Bauchi Province and is estimated
to involve some 58,000 farm families engaged in the growing of cotton, ground-
nuts, maize, sorghum and cow peas and supporting a total population of about
640,000 representing 6 percent of the state population.
32.       The proposed loan would assist Nigeria's North Eastern State Govern-
ment (NES) to finance an agricultural development project which would involve
the construction of vital crop extraction roads and water supplies, and would
provide farmers with the technical, marketing and credit services, and inputs
required to increase production and farm income. Currently the latter are
low, $284 per family and $34 per capita.
33.       The project would be carried out over a five-year investment period
1975/76 - 1979/80, and would involve:
(a) constructing about 1,000 km of low cost agricultural roads,
85 small and medium size earth dams, 160 tapkis (ponds),
and associated soil conservation structures;
(b) constructing an administrative center at Gombe, 5 development
unit centers, and 50 farm service centers;
(c) developing and equipping seed multiplication farms at Kumo and
Tumu;
(d) expanding training facilities at Tumu and constructing a new
project training center at Kumo;
(e) provision of adequate farmer extension, and marketing
services, including staff, vehicles and equipment;
(f) provision of seasonal and medium-term loans to farmers for the
purchase of crop inputs and farm equipment;
(g) establishing a project evaluation unit;



(h) provision of consultant services for the preparation of feasi-
bility studies; and
(i) preparation of plans for the continued provision of project
services after the investment phase of the project is completed.
34.       The project is designed on a scale to ensure a sufficient impact,
given the size and population of the country. There is the added advant-
age that the project would provide practical training for Nigerian staff in
the technical and administrative management of projects of this type and, if
successful, the project concept could be applied in many other areas of
northern Nigeria.
Project Execution
35.       The project would be managed by the Gombe Project MIanagement Unit
(GOPMU) which would carry out its day to day management. GOPMU would be
responsible to the Gombe Project Executive Committee (GOPEC) for budgeting
and policy control; the Chairman of GOPEC would be the Permanent Secretary
of the Ministry of Natural Resources (MIR) of NES. GOPM4U and GOPEC would
be established as a condition of loan effectiveness in a form and with
membership, functions and responsibilities satisfactory tto the Bank. GOPMU
would have its headquarters at Gombe, the divisional town and center of the
project area, and would enjoy autonomy greater than that afforded to the
technical divisions of NNR. GOPMU would coordinate its activities at a
Federal level through a Federal Coordinating Committee.
36.       GOP'IU would be responsible for the procurement, distribution and
sale, for cash or credit, of fertilizers, seeds, insecticides, sprayers,
ox-drawn equipment, tractors and other necessary farm supplies and would
decide on the suitability and composition of any package of inputs offered
to farmers.
37.       The creditworthiness of each loan applicant would be certified by
a project approved farmers association; this would be part of the mutual
guarantee policy that GOPHU would pursue.   Provision would also be made to
extend credit to groups or to village farmers associations if farmers wish
to pool input requirements and assume joint liability for credit. Before
the beginning of each planting season, a schedule of proposed lending terms
falling within the range of 5 to 9-1/2 percent would be furnished by GOPMU
to GOPEC which would, in consultation with appropriate Nigerian Authorities
and the Bank, apply the lending terms for the season.
38.       Recognizing the need for considerable improvement in primary market-
ing, the project would include various measures to improve marketing in
general. These would include improved weighing and measuring devices and
village storage facilities, and the timely announcement in accordance with
existing practice at the presentation of the annual Federal Budget; establishment
and enforcement of greater discipline of Licensed Buying Agents (LBA) and
produce inspection staff.



- 12 -
39.       Both the Federal and State Governments recognize the need for
qualified and experienced staff to administer the project and assure high
technical standards. in its field implementation. The northern states are
generally short of qualified personnel to fill key project management and
senior technical posts and the demand for personnel with such expertise re-
mains high. NES is fully aware of the problem of staffing the project ad-
equately and is prepared to recruit staff internationally, where qualified
Nigerian personnel are not available. International recruitment is expected
to be necessary for the managerial posts of Project Manager, Chief Accountant,
and Chief Engineer, and a condition of loan effectiveness would be that such
posts, in addition to that of Chief Administrative Officer and Chief Tech-
nical Officer to be recruited locally, had been filled. Existing staff in
the project area would come under the project and additional staff would be
transferred to the project from other areas of the State. Priority during
the first two years would be given to the project for those Agricultural
Assistants completing ongoing training courses. On this basis, sufficient
professional and technical staff would be available. Retroactive financing
of US$150,000 is proposed to cover the appointment of key personnel referred
to above with effect from July 25, 1974.
40.       A degree in Agriculture is offered by the Ahmadu Bello University
at Zaria in the North Central State (which also serves all six northern
States) and it is expected that some of the graduates would be recruited
for the project. In addition, the Division of Agriculture and Livestock
Service Training (DALST) of ABU also offers both a 3-year diploma and a 2-year
certificate course in various aspects of agriculture which could be utilized
for middle management training for the project. The North Eastern State also
operates (a) farm training centers for the training of Agricultural Instructors
(AI), the lowest grade of extension worker and (b) farm institutes for farmer
training. Provision has been made under the project for the up-grading of the
existing Tumu Farm Institute to a Farm Training Center and for the construc-
tion of a new Farm Training Center at Kumo, both of which would be used, in
the initial years of the project, to train project staff particularly AI and
Credit Assistants (CA). Such training would initially consist of simple
short courses on specific crops and associated problems. A. I. would receive
further training after a period of field experience, and thereafter regular
refresher courses. Credit and marketing staff would be trained in a similar
manner through a series of in-service courses. Later on, the emphasis would
be more on farmer training. It is not anticipated that the recruitment of
individuals for training as A. I., C. A. and other junior technical posts
under the project would present any serious problems. The basic level of
primary education throughout northern Nigeria is relatively good and, there
is an increasing surplus of West African School Certificate holders on the
labor market.
41.       In addition to the training of lower level staff discussed above
and the training of higher level staff on an in-service basis, GOPMU would
also pay particular attention to the training of selected staff to fill
managerial functions. In this respect, internationally recruited staff would,



- 13 -
as one of their responsibilities, ensure the adequate training of their subor-
dinates, and would be required to submit to GOPEC through the project manager,
quarterly reports on the training aspects of their sections. The project
manager would have the overall responsibility for ensuring that an adequate
management training program is maintained and would report regularly on its
progress in order to satisfy both the NES and the Bank of the adequacy of
the program. Additional funds have been provided under the project for
the recruitment of a training specialist in the event the project manager
considers this necessary.
42.       The project would provide for the employment of consultants (60
man months) to assist Federal and State Government agricultural planning teams
to prepare feasibility studies for similar projects. In most instances,
consultants would be individually employed, and support services for such con-
sultants would be provided from normal Government budget allocations.
Project Costs
43.       Project costs are estimated at US$42.1 million of which the foreign
exchange component would be US$20,2 millJon or 48 percent of total costs.
Details of project costs are given in Annex III. Project costs include a 5
percent physical contingency and a variable price contingency (7 - 12 percent
compounded) over the proposed five-year loan 4isbursement period. Contingen-
cies amount to US$10.2 million or 24 percent of total project costs. The
Bank loan would finance 50 percent of the total project costs which would
cover the entire foreign exchange costs and a small percentage (4%) of local
costs amounting to approximately $0.8 million. A summary of the proposed
financing plan for the project is given as follows:

Procurement
44.       Procurement of vehicles, plant, equipment, fertilizers, insecticides,
farm tractors and implements, where orders or contracts have a value of more
than US$25,000 would be through international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with IBRD guidelines. Such procurement is estimated to have a value
of about US$13.4 million. Domestically manufactured goods would be allowed
a 15% preference when comparing domestic bids with those of foreign manufac-
turers. Contracts for the construction of buildings, staff houses, and
the purchase of construction materials and furnishings valued at US$6.1
million would not be attractive to foreign contractors due to the dispersed
location of the work and the small size of individual contracts and orders,
and -would be awarded under locally advertised competitive bidding. Bona
fide domestic contractors would receive a 7-1/2 percent preference in bid
evaluation. Construction of roads, water supplies and soil conservation works
estimated at US$6.7 million would be carried out on force account due to the
shortage of suitable medium scale contractors who normally would undertake



- 15 -
this work. However, small contractors would be employed to the maximum
extent feasible. A large part of project costs (an estimated US$12.3
million) would be for labor, staff salaries and allowances, vehicle maintenance
and operation, general services, project evaluation, and feasibility study
preparation and, as such, would generally be unsuitable for competitive bidd-
ing. Those items not included specifically under procedures for ICB or to be
advertised locally would be purchased through local commercial channels.
Disbursements
45.       The proceeds of the Bank loan (US$21 million) would be disbursed
over five years (1975/76 - 1979/80) to cover 50 percent of total project
costs and would be expended against the following categories:
(a) 100% of the cif cost of directly imported vehicles, heavy plant,
and equipment or 75% of the cost of these items if locally pro-
cured, totalling US$2.1 million;
(b) 100% of the cif cost of directly imported farm tractors and equip-
ment, ox-drawn equipment, spraying machines, fertilizers, insecti-
cides, battery sets and seeds or 71% of the cost of these items if
procured locally totalling US$4.1 million;
(c) 100% of the cost of internationally recruited staff totalling
US$1.5 million;
(d) 60% of the cost of buildings, staff housing, and construction
material and labor for roads, dams and soil conservation works
totalling US$3.7 million;
(e) 60% of local staff costs totalling US$3.2 million;
(f) 60% of the cost of the field evaluation unit totalling US$0.5
million;
(g) 100% of the cost of consultant services to prepare feasibility
studies totalling US$0.3 million; and
(h) an unallocated amount totalling US$5.6 million to cover physical
and price contingencies.
46.       Disbursement of the Bank loan would be against import documentation,
contracts and certified records of expenditures. For disbursements made
against certified records of expenditures, documentation would not be
submitted for review as a matter of course, but would be retained by the
project management unit for scrutiny by Bank supervision missions. Any sur-
plus loan funds after the completion of the project would be used to further
develop the project area.



- 16 -
Economic Rate of Return
47.       The economic rate of return from investment in the project is
estimated at 17 percent. The project's principal direct benefit would be
the incremental increase in farm production that it would generate and
which would result directly in an additional net income of about US$149
per family, an increase of 45% per family for some 32,000 farm families,
and better living standards for a further 26,000 who would benefit through
the improved infra-structure and marketing arrangements within the project
area. If the non-farming population, traders, laborers, etc., are included,
then about 640,000 people would in one way or other receive primary or
secondary benefits through project activities. Some of the more important
and secondary benefits that would accrue from the project include (a) a
general improvement in communications, and an increase in local trade and
employment opportunities for the non-farming population in the project area;
(b) a degree of stabilization of the North Eastern State population in more
productive activities (an estimated net increase in employment of some 12,000
man years per annum is expected to result from project actions); (c) the
use of the project by the NES to test new development, credit and marketing
techniques that could be quickly applied to other state farms; and the
extended use of the seed multiplication centers for the provision of improved
seeds to farmers in other parts of the State; (d) an annual net incremental
foreign exchange earnings amounting to some US$12.8 million that would accrue
to FMG coffers once the project attains full production; (e) the use of
information accumulated by the project evaluation unit in the formulation of
future agricultural policy and resource and financial allocation throughout
the country by the FMG. In general terms, the project should result in
improved farm management practice and some reduction in existing income
disparity, while ensuring a more even food supply for Nigeria's urban popula-
tion and commercial livestock industry.
Risks
48        In any agricultural project dealing mainly with smallholders, the
success of which would largely depend on adequate rainfall as well as the
timely staffing of a number of new organizations, involves risks. However,
it is believed that the project would minimize such risks, given the provision
of competent management and proven technical innovations; as the farmers are
hardworking, and the production to be induced by the project is in high demand
on both the domestic and export markets. No serious ecological risks are
envisaged, though the possibility would be closely monitored and the necessary
corrective action taken.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENT AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Federal Republic of Nigeria
and the Bank and the draft Project Agreement between the Bank and the North-
Eastern State of Nigeria, the report of the Committee provided for in Article



- 17 -
III, Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement, and the text of a Resolu-
tion approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive
Directors separately.
50.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with.the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMNENDATION
51.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C.  Projects in Execution
Credit 72-UNI, Education Project:   US$20.0 million
Credit of March 1, 1965; Revised Closing Date:   June 30, 1976
Loan 814-UNIf Second Education Project: US$17.3 million
Loan cfApl,1972; Closing Date:          December 31, 1975
Loan 929-WNI, Third Education Project: US$54.o million
L_an of August 16, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1978
The first education project (72-UNI) had a late start in implementa-
tion, particularly in the three eastern states which were affected by the
civil strife between 1967 and 1970.   Execution of project schools in these
states is at working drawings stage while the majority of project schools
in other states are under construction. Completion of work in eastern
states might take about two more years. Pxecution of the second education
project (814-UNI) is generally satisfactory, although it is twelve months
behind schedule and special implementation assistance would be needed in
one state to avoid further delay. The third education project (929-UNI)
has not yet been declared effective pending appointment of consultant-
architects and execution of subsidiary loan agreements and legal opinion.
The effectiveness date has been postponed to December 31, 197h. Action
to appoint consultant-architects and to fulfill the other conditions of
effectiveness is progressing.
Loan 427-UNI, Western Road Project:   US$14.5 million
Loan of September 26, 1965; Revised Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Loan 694-UNI, Transport Rehabilitation: US$25.0 million
Loan of June 26, 1970; Revised Closing Date: March 31, 1975
Loan 838-UNI, Fifth Highway Project: US$26.3 million
Loan of June 16, 192     Closing Date:  June 30, 1977
There has been a saving of $2.5 million in Loan 427-UNI, out of which
procurement of road machinery and conduct of a photogrammatic survey would
be financed and the balance, estimated at approximately $2 million, would
likely be cancelled. Construction work and procurement under the Transport
Rehabilitation Loan (694-UNI) have proceeded satisfactorily except for
procurement of some railway equipment which has been affected by administra-
tive delays as well as delays in delivery schedule due to the energy crisis.
However, deliveries are now proceeding satisfactorily and the loan is expected
to be fully disbursed by March 31, 1975.
Loan 705-UNI, Nigerian Industrial Development Bank: US$10.0 million
Loan of August 28  1970; Revised Closing Date:   March 31, 1975
This loan is fully committed. Withdrawals out of this loan in 1973
were slower than expected owing to cancellation of sub-project loan commit-
ments.

Loan 764-UNI, Western Cocoa Project: US$7.2 million
Loan of June 23, 1971; Closing Date:   March 31, 1977
Loan 1045-UNI, Second Cocoa Project: US$20 million
Loan of October 11. 1974; Closing Date: September 30, 1981
Though there was delay under Loan 764-UNI in the establishment of
the Cocoa Development Unit and only 65 percent of first year planting
was achieved, excellent progress was made and the 1973 planting target
and 1972 backlog have been fulfilled. The Second Cocoa Project (Loan
1045-UNI) is expected to become effective by January 1975.
Loan 847-UNI, Fourth Power Project:   US$76.0 million
Loan of June 30, 1972; Closing Date: December 31, 1977
This loan became effective only on June 13, 1973, owing to delay
in connection with the Loan Assumption Agreement for the previous Bank
loans in this sector. Progress on the Bank project is considered satis-
factory.
Loan 922-UNI, Second Lagos Ports Project: US$55 million
Loan of August 1, 1973; Closing Date: December 31, 1979
This loan became effective on October 29, 1973 and implementation
of the project is proceeding satisfactorily.

1/   Project costs include a 5 percent physical contingency and a
variable price contingency based on the Bankts Central Projects
staff guidelines for treatment of project costs over the proposed
five-year disbursement period. Total price contingency equivalent
to 32 percent of baseline costs. Fertilizer costs, which have
increased out of proportion to other costs were amended at
negotiations to reflect current prices, and because the average
current 1980 prices have been projected to be about the same as
the current 1974 prices, price contingencies for fertilizer have
not been included.

locally advertised competitive bidding though foreign firms would not be
precluded from bidding. Domestic contractors as defined by the borrower and
accepted by the Bank would receive a 7-1/2 percent preference in bid evaluation.
Construction of roads, water supplies and soil conservation works valued at
US$6.7 million would be carried out on force account though petty contractors
would be employed to the maximum extent feasible. An estimated US$12.3 million
would be for labor, staff salaries and allowances, vehicle maintenance and
operation and, as such, generally be unsuitable for competitive bidding. Items
not qualifying for ICB or local advertisement to be purchased through commer-
cial channels. Remainder of project costs of about US$10.2 million would be
contingencies.
Rate of Return
The economic rate of return from investment in the project is
estimated at 17 percent.
