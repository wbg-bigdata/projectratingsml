MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
THE COMMONWEALTH OF THE BAHAMAS
FOR A SECOND TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL "RAINING PROJECT
1.       The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Commonwealth of The Bahamas for US$10.0 million equivalent is submitted
for approval. The proposed loan would be for a term of 15 years, including
five years' grace, and would help fVnance a second technical and vocational
training project.
2.       Background.  Since independence in 1973, the economy of The
Bahamas has expanded at an average annual rate of 3.0Z. Tourism, with
related services, has grown to become the country's largest industry and
now accounts for 35? of GDP and, directly and indirectly, as much as 50? of
overall employment. But further growth and future competitiveness of the
tourism sector are constrained by a shortage of trained Bahamian workers in
a broad range of occupations, both in hospitality-related fields and in
services such as transportation and technical maintenance. This shortage
of skills contributes to re.atively low productivity of tourism services
and to an excessive dependence on expatriates, who comprise about 10? of
the workforce in skilled and technical occupations. The adverse effects
are felt particularly in the Family Islands (24 secondary islands, with
about 20? of the population), where the potential for new investments is
large, but expansion is constrained by a lack of suitably skilled manpower.
3.       The Government is aware of the existing skills shortages--which
coexist with substantial open unemployment--and, over the past two decades,
has sustained a major effort to develop the country's overall education and
training system. While it has been successful in general education, with
participation rates in excess of 952 in primary and 75Z in secondary
education, it has fallen far short of meeting vocational and technical
training needs. In particular, the country's tourism training
institutions--the Bahamas Hotel Training College (BHTC) under the Ministry
of Education, the regional University of the Vest Indies Centre for Hotel
and Tourism Management (UWI-CHTM), and the BahamaHost Program of the
Ministry of Tourism--continue to operate in substandard facilities, even
though these institutions are receiving financing for operations from
employers and trade unions and have been able to generate substantial
additional revenue through fees and services.
4.       Some progress in training has been made with Bank assistance under
the First Technical and Vocational Education Project (Ln. 1962-BM). This
project helped organize a national manpower training system, including the
creation of a National Training Council (NTC) with representatives of
employers. It has also been instrumental in strengthening key training
institutions, increasing their outputs, and improving, in particular, the
quality of preservice training of mechanical and construction technicians
and health workers. Among remaining training deficiencies, the more
critical are: limited capability of training institutions to respond
flexibly to changes in labor markets; insufficient private sector inputs to



-2-
training, including lack of institutional arrangements for private sector
participation in advisory boards or training policy committeess the very
narrow coverage of a fledgling apprenticeship system; insufficient cost
recovery in public institutions and inadequate targeting of subsidies to
needy students; lack of critical skills among selected categories of
employed workers, such as mechanics and tradesmen in construction,
maintenance workers and supervisors, and management personnel; weak
coordination and articulation among training programs in general, and
particularly at the post-secondary level and in tourism training: and
limited opportunities and facilities for training for adults and out-of-
school youth in some geographic areas.
5.       In view of continued growth of the Bahamian economy and the
prospects for development of tourism, improvements are required in
training, both in policies for management and finance and in the quality
and diversity of programs. Government training policy and strategy
addresses these concerns, emphasizing the need to improve and expand
training in a cost-effective and cost containing mannerl the proposed
project would help translate the strategy into concrete actions.
6.       Rationale for Bank Involvement.  In 1984 the Executive Directors
were advised of the intention to graduate The Bahamas from Bank lending
after a phase-out period of four years. The phase-out lending program
involves a water and sewerage loan of US$10.0 million (approved on October
14, 1986), and the proposed Second Technical and Vocational Training
Project. Thus, the proposed loan would be the last one to the country.
Bank strategy for training is to support adjustment in management and
finance policies in order to increases the responsiveness of the training
system to iabor market requirements; the opportunities for individuals to
enhance their technical knowledge and skills; the sustainability of public
training institutions; and the productivity of training expenditures.
Given experience acquired under the first project, and by being able to
offer a combination of technical and financial assistance centered around
Improved policies for training management and finance, the Bank is well
positioned to help achieve major improvements in this sector.
7.       Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project would assist the second
phase of the Government's long term strategy to develop its training
system. By focussing on improved labor market information, new
arrangements to strengthen institutional coordination and private sector
participation, and increased cost recovery in public institutions providing
training for the tourism sector as well as for other service sectors, it
would help develop an institutional and policy framework for management and
finance of training that would make more efficient use of available
training resources, both public and private. In addition, the project
would improve planning of post-secondary education and training; upgrade
and expand training capacity primarily for the hotel and tourism sectors
and in the Family Islands; improve the relevance of training by developing
curricula that concentrate on clusters of related skills; and expand
training opportunities in selected Family Islands.
8.       Project Description.  The project would have four mutually
supporting components. The Institutional Development and Policy
Implementation Component (8? of project cost) would implement policies and
procedures to make the entire training system more responsive to labor



-3-
market needs and to ensure its future sustainability, and would provide
specialist assistance and studies, staff training, and eqvipment in order
to (a) improve the labor market information system; (b) expand the
apprenticeship system; (c) strengthen NTC and its national advisory
committees, and create local training committees with employers'
representatives; (d) increase cost recovery in both preservice and
inservice training, and achieve better targeting of subsidies under the
Government's training stipend program to needy individuals; and (e) improve
coordination among training instit-utions, introduce a graduate tracer
system as a means to evaluate training efficiency and emrloyment outcomes,
and prepare a master plan for post-secondary education.  The Skills
Trainin: Component (362) would improve and expand training in priority
skills which are not hospitality-specific but yet essential for supporting
*            infrastructure and services, such as construction and technical
maintenance, and would (a) provide new training programs and related
complementary equipment and facilities, including mobile units, and a
maintenance and supply center, for preservice training of adults and out-
of-school youth as well as for secondary students, and (b) establish a
program of inservice training, fully financed by beneficiaries, at two
existing Industrial Training Centers (ITCs) and 22 Community Skills Centers
and Area Vocatic-al Centers located in the 11 major islands. These
training programs, operated in a modular and short-course format, would be
prepared under the oversight of national and local training advisory
committees and would be delivered flexibly in response to labor marl'et
needs.  The Tourism Training Component (502) would improve and expand
training directly related to the tourism industry and would include (a)
technical assistance to prepare and implement measures to strengthen and
coordinate training programs for the toutism industry, develop training
materials, and train teachers; and (b) civil works, furniture and equipment
for a new Hotel Training Institute to be used jointly by BHTC, UWI-CHTM and
the BahamaHost Program. The Project Management Component (62) would
include expanded staffing and training for the existing project
implementation unit. The project would be carried out over a period of six
years. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$17.4 million
equivalent, including taxes and duties estimated at US$2.0 million, and
with a foreign exchange component of US$11.5 million (66?). The project
cost summary and financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The proposed loan
of US$10.0 million (572 of project cost) includes US$400,000 of retroactive
financing to enable the Government to initiate technical assistance and
consultant services whose outputs are necessary for project startup.
Amounts and methods of procurement and the disbursement schedule are shown
in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in The Bahamas are given in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report No.
7263-BM, dated October 24, 1988, is also attached.
9.       Actions Agreed.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with
the Government on the followings (a) plans of action to implement the labor
market information system and expand the apprenticeship system, and a dated
program to introduce adjustments in management and finance of training.
Specific actions are to: (i) establish subject-matter advisory committees
and local training committees by December 31, 1989, establish the labor
market information system, in a form acceptable to the Bank, by June 30,
1989, and implement the system for maintenance and materials supply by June
30, 1990; (ii) implement policies, criteria and procedures, acceptable to



- 4 -
the Bank, enabling NTC to receive and expend funds for training, and to
target training stipends on needy students by June 30, 1989; (iii) expand
the apprenticeship system to six trades each in New Providence and Grand
Bahama by December 31, 1990; (iv) complete the master plan for post-
secondary and higher education by December 31, 1991; and (v) achieve no
less than 50X employer financing of preservice training in BHTC by December
31, 1991; (b) an action plan to be sent to the Bank for its comments by
June 30, 1990, to achieve the proposed improvements in training delivery
and management and the training of managers and instructors. Revised
preservice and inservice training programs would be presented to the Bank
for comment by June 30, 1990 and implemented, in a form acceptable to the
Bank, beginning with academic year 1990191, and a graduate tracer system
satisfactory to the Bank would be introduced by December 31, 1989; and (c)
a management structure, and financing and operation programs of the joint
tourism training facility acceptable to the Bank. Specifically, an
agreement was reached that the tourism training component would be
implemented in accordance with the recommendations made by consultants in a
recently completed Special Study of Hotel Training in The Bahamas,
ilcluding terms, conditions, timetable and management arrangements for
efficient operation and sharing among the participating institutions of the
new joint Hotel Training Institute. Conditions of loan effectiveness would
be that the Project Implementation Unit would have been established and
that the project manager and a procurement specialist would have been
appointed; and that the titles of the sites for the Hotel Training
Institute and the ITC in Freeport would have been legally transferred to
the Ministry of Education. The appointment of a civil works coordinator
would be a condition for disbursement against the civil works category.
10.      Benefits.  The project would help improve the quality and
productivity of hotel and tourism services, as well as those of other
industries and services. This would ultimately reduce the current reliance
on expatriate personnel in the industry, tl reby making The Bahamas more
competitive as a tourist destination in the region. It would also help to
achieve more balanced development by providing greater training
opportunities in the Family Islands.
11.      Risks.  The proposed project is not expected to face any unusual
risks. Project implementation arrangements were established under the
previous Bank loan in the sector. These have been functioning well and
will be used for the proposed project with selective strengthening to
assure a uniform rate of implementation.
12.      Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
