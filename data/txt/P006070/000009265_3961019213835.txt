COMMONWEALTH OF THE IBAIAMAS
SECOND TECHNICAL AND VOCATINAL lTRAEiNG IROJECT
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Second Technical and
Vocational Training Project in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, for which Loan 3004-BM
in the amount of US10.0 million was approved on December 8, 1988 and made effective on
May 9, 1989.
The Loan was closed on June 30, 1995. An amount of US$7.3 million was disbursed
and the outstanding balance of US$2.5 million was canceled as of October 31, 1995. The last
disburseent was on November 29, 1994. The balance of US$244,273.35 is still in the
special account. However, eligible expenditures for US$191,029 have been identified. The
balance of US$64,697.31 is in the process of being recovered.
The ICR was prepared by Ms. Ines Girsback of the Human Resources Division of the
Latin America and Caribbean Regional Office Country Dpartment mI (Preface, Evaluation
Summary, Parts I and II), and reviewed by Mr. Julian Schweitzer, Chief of the Human
Resources Division and Mr. Robert Crown, Project Advisor. The Borrower made inputs to
Part I and the Statistical Annexes, and prepared a separate completion report which is included
as an Appendix B.
Preparation of this ICR is based, inteia. on the Staff Apprsisal Report (Report No.
7263-BM, dated October 24, 1988), the Loan Agreement, supervision reports, review of the
files of correspondence between the Bank and the Borrower, and internal Bank memoranda and
discussion with Bank staff involved in supervision of the project. There has been no special
ICR mission. However, the last supervision mission left a comprehensive Aide Memoire
(Appendix A) which covered activities to be done until the closing of the project.






IMPEENAION C OMPLETINRPR
COMMONWVEALTH OF THE BAHAMAS
EVALUATION SUlMMARY
Inthrduction
1.    The project objective was to help implement major elements of the second phase of the
Government's long term plan to expand and upgrade the country's training system. The
project was appraised in April 1988, and a loan approved by the Board on December 8, 1988.
Total project costs were estimated at US$17.4 million, of which the proposed Bank loan was
US$10.0 million. About 75% of the original loan amount was disbursed, and the undisbursed
balance of US$2.5 was canceled as of October 31, 1995. The project was implemented within
the initially estimated time-frame of six years, which is consistent with the experience of the
Ministry of Education and Training in implementing the First Technical and Vocational
Education Project.
Project Objectives and Achievaeents
2.    Objectives: The project pursued two key objectives, namely: (i) to provide
institutional development and improved policy implementation in training managfement and
finance; and (ii) to expand and upgrade training capacity in combination with measures to use
existing training capacity more effectively. In order to achieve these goals, the project
comprised four integral supporting components: institutional development and policy
implementation, including increased cost recovery in training (8% of project cost); skills
training, including curriculum development and limited improvement of training facilities
(36%); tourism training, including construction and equipment of a new Hotel Training
Instihte (50%); and project management (6%).
3.    Achievements: The overall outcome of the project has been rated as moderately
satisfactry. All civil works components have been completed, and related equipment has been
distributed and installed, with the exception of project componeats in the Family Islands.
Overall training has been expanded and upgraded with enrollment and output meetng and
sometimes exceeding appraisal estimates. The capacity to train vocational instructors and
practical subject teachers has been enhanced while still dependent on outside expertise.
However, the project was less successful in meedng its institutional strengthening and policy
objectives. These shortcomings were due mainly to the establishment of overly ambitious
project objectives, related to:



ii
* the speed of achievement of major policy changes, such as private sector financing of
training, and greater cooperation among the autonomous tertiary level institutions involved
in the Bahamas Tourism Training Center (BTTC);
*  an underestimation of project support needed to achieve major changes in the management
of the apprenticeship system and the labor market information system; and
* insufficient training of subject specialists for technical and vocational education, which has
left the Borrower still dependent on outside expertise for major training program changes.
4.    The project was successful in improving the management and sustainability of training,
although more is still needed. The new Government that took office in the summer of 1992,
formed a Task Force to evaluate the education system and make recommendations. As a
result, new policy directions emerged, and education sector priorities and budgets were
reallocated in favor of a massive rehabilitation program for the public schools in the country.
The Master Plan for Post Secondary Education prepared under the project was never
implemented and its recommendations discarded by the Task Force.
Detild  Project Results
5.    The civil works component comprising the construction of the Bahamas Tourism
Training Center (new Hotel Training Institute), and the addition of three workshops to the
Industrial Training Center (ITC) in Freeport have been completed and related furniture and
equipment have been installed. Supplemental equipment for the lTC in Nassau has been
installed. Phase 1 of the Community Skills Training Centers (CSTCs) at Crooked Island
Secondary, Crooked Island and Old Bight Secondary, and Cat Island was completed, with
related equipment and furniture largely distributed and installed. Renovations to existing
workshops/laboratories in the Family Islands have been largely completed, and supplemental
equipment for these has also been distributed and installed. The same is true for the CR Walker
Secondary School at Nassau.
6.    Overall, training has been expanded and upgraded, and is operational. The mobile
training component to be put in place in the Family Islands was not fully implemented.
Modular training programs have been developed in response to labor market needs, and the
capacity to train instructors and managers has been developed. The technical assistance
component to strengthen the various key agencies in the education sector was only partially
implemented, namely the establishment of a Labor Market Information System (LMIS);
strengthening of the apprenticeship program; and establishment of national advisory
committees. Cost sharing and cost recovery measures were implemented at the Bahamas Hotel
Training College (BHTC), but not at the ITC because of insufficient support from the National
Advisory Committee for Industrial and Technical Education and Training (formerly the
National Training Council) and the Government's wish to stimulate atendance at the ITCs to
respond to demands of the labor market. In addition, the project provided for feIlowship
programs, but not all funds for this purpose were utilized (i.e. 43 person months out of a total
of 46 planned).
7.    The major shortcomings have been the result of the lack of counterpart financing and a
shift in Government priorities in 1992. These shortcomings include: (i) suspension of the
construction of 16 of the 18 CSTCs intended for the Family Islands; (ii) non-establishment of a



imi
now system to maintain buildings and equipment at project schools and centers, and to instruct
teawhers in maintenance programs (now being envisaged under an IDB education project); and
(iii) failure to establish graduate tracer systems at BHTC and lTCs. Procurement of the mobile
units for the mobile training programs was not undertaken. Additional equipment to upgrade
the LMIS and the apprenticeship system, as well as the automation of the administrative offices
of BHTC and the ITCs which were proposed by the last Supervision Mission was not
procured.
Proj   Expeirnce
8.    The differences between actual and planned project activities were largely the result of
Government financial constraints (exacerbated by hurricane damage in August 1992), and a
shift of Government education priorities. The 1992 change of Government resulted in
increased Government interest in the Family Islands but with a reorientation of the education
sector priorities towards secondary education. The Master Plan for Post Secondary Education
prepared under the project and submitted to the former Government was overtaken by a
detailed sector study commissioned by the new Government, which provided a more
satisfactory basis for education policy at the post-secondary level. In addition, focus of the
education program was shifted towards an extensive rehabilitation and construction program to
improve access to basic education. This policy change primarily affected the already delayed
Family Islands component, which had been designed to redress the traditional neglect of
outlying areas. The 1993-94 budget allocation for the project was used for an emergency
rehabilitation program of civil works, especially in the Family Islands where the sector study
found the situation regarding the conditions of schools to be quite unsatisfactory. At this
point, the project should have had to be restructured, but overoptimistic ratings during
supervision of the project mislead the need of redirection of the policy component. No
budgetary provision for the project was made for fiscal year July 1994/June 1995, and this
further delayed the distribution of equipment which had been procured under the project for
some of the training workshops, and which remained in storage. In September 1995, most of
the equipment has been distributed and installed in the workshops in two new secondary
schools of Grand Bahama. The reminder is being distributed in existing secondary schools
outside the project.
Project Su inability
9.    The achievement of the core of the project objectives fell within the expected time
frame, even though long-term project sustainability in terms of institutional strengthening, and
completion of physical components (i.e. civil works, and equipment and furniture) in the
Family Islands is uncertain. Most of the key training centers under the project were
strengthened, and their role in the economic and social development of the country was
increased.! The gains achieved under the project are financially sustainable. Recurrent cost
The key taining instions that were stengthened are the Bahamas Tourism Training Center -
which houses the Bahamas Hotel Training College under the Ministy of Educaion and Traunng, the
Center for Hotel Trnig Managem  within the Universty of the West Indies, and the
Bahamt which is under sponsorship of the Ministry of Torism - in addition to the Indutrial
Traimg Centers, and the Communty ills Training Centers. The achiewvments in regard to
Commuity skills Trainng Centers was much more limited.



iv
financing of these training institutions does not pose a significant problem in the future.
However, beyond the increased training capacity, the project did not achieve significant
expansion of the role of the private sector in TVET financing, or the introduction of new cost
recovery mechanisms.
Key Lem=n Learned
10.   Key lessons leamned can be summarized as follows:
*  Policy on sector development should be based on detailed sector work, a broader
stakeholder participation and better commitment building, which would have minimized the
risk of major changes in policy at the mid-implemention stage of the project.
* The Bank should initiate restructuring of projects when political priorities change, in order
to retain ownership.
* Project objectives as defined with the governments in the SAR should be realistic, focused,
and take into consideration the feasibility of achieving major policy and institutional
changes over the short term.
*  Supervision missions should be appropriately staffed. Adequate field visits should be
undertaken and supervision reports should accurately document actual progress in attaining
developmental objectives.

(LOAN 300-?D
PART I. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ASSESSMENT
A.   Project Objectives and Description
1.    Projec Objectves: The project, which was appraised in April 1988 and approved by
-the Board in December 1988, was the final pregraduation lending operation for the Bahamas.
The project was designed to assist the second phase of the Government's long term strategy to
develop the country's training system. Its objectives were to: (i) develop an institutional and
policy framework for management and financing of training that would make more efficient use
of available training resources, both public and private; and (ii) improve planning of post-
secondary education and training, upgrade and expand training capacity, primarily for the hotel
and tourism sectors, and expand training opportunities in selected Family Islands.
2.    Proj: In order to achieve these objectives, the project comprised four
components. The Instiulonal Dvelopment and Poliy  tplemennuon Component aimed at
making the entire training system more responsive to labor market needs by: (a) improving the
labor market information system, (b) expanding the apiceahip system, (c) strengthening
the National Training Council (NTC), and establishing national advisory committees, (d)
increasing cost recovery from trainees and cost sharing by Government, employers and unions
in training, and (e) introducing a graduate tracer system. The Skis Training Component was
to support the infrastructure and hospitality (tourism) services through the provision of: (a)
new training programs and related complementary equipment and facilities, including mobile
units, and a maintenance and supply center; and (b) in-service training at two existing
Industrial Training Centers (ITCs) and 18 new Community Skills Training Centers (CSTCs).
The Tourism 7raining Component, representing half of the total project cost, comprised
technical assistance to strengthen and coordinate training programs for the tourism industry;
and civil works, furniture and equipment for a new Hotel Training Institute. The Project
Management Cbomnent included expanded staffing and training for the existing project
implementation unit.
3.            with Sector Strategy: Skills training in the Bahamas had advanced
significandy in the 1980s, with Bank assistance provided thrugh the First Technical and
Vocational Training Project (Loan 1962-BM of US$7.0 million for which the Agreement was
signed in May 1981). Loan 3004-BM supported the Govrnment's evolving education and
training stategy, as updated in 1986, which emphasized improvement in the quality and
dficiency of vocational and technical training, as well as increased outputs based on (i) an
improved Labor Market Information System (LMIS), and (ii) government- and privately-



2
funded development plans for major employment initiatives (i.e., Family Islands). Major areas
of training involved the hotel and tourism industry, and other degree-level higher education
programs, aimed at gradually reducing the reliance on expatriates at the middle and higher
technical and middle management levels, thus helping to keep tourism costs competitive.
B.    Achievement of Project Objectives
4.    As Table 1 in the Statistical Annexes indicates, the overall outcome of the project was
rated moderately satisfactory with achievements in every major area, especially in physical
aspects - completion of the civil works and installation of related equipment - except on the
institutional side. Training in the system was upgraded and expanded, and is now fully
operational, with the exception of mobile training. The capacity to train instructors was
expanded. One of the major policy objectives was to overcome the traditional neglect of the
Family Islands, and this was only partly achieved under the project itself. On the institutional
side, shortcomings reflected mainly unrealistic objectives (especially in regard to rationalizing
the programs of autonomous higher level training institutions and introducing cost recovery
and cost sharing of training), and insufficient project support for achieving the objectives. The
LMS has been established but need more staffing and equipment for optimum usage; the
apprenticeship program management has been expanded in New Providence but is still virtually
non-existent in Grand Bahama; advisory committees have been established in Nassau, but in
only 5 of the 9 major Family Islands; the graduate tracer system is incomplete at the ITCs and
at the Bahamas Hotel Training College (BHTC). However, for lack of equipment-automation
of administrative offices, only a partial follow-up of graduates has been achieved.
5.    With the establishment of the new Government in August 1992, the implementation of
the remaining project activities in the Family Islands came to a halt partly because of
redistribution of responsibilities between the Ministry of Education and Training (METI) and
the Ministry of Labor, Human Resources and Training (MOHLRAT). The Master Plan for
Post Secondary Education, prepared under the project and submitted to the former Cabinet,
was overtaken by a detailed sector study commissioned by the new Government, which was a
more satisfactory way of proceeding towards a sector development policy. Education sector
priorities as well as corresponding budget allocations were revised towards the implementation
of a massive public school rehabilitation program across the country. Consequently, project
components that were yet to be implemented in the Family Islands were suspended because of
lack of Government financing. However, despite clear signs of increasing lack of ownership,
the Bank failed in restructuring the project to better focus on new developmental objectives.
C.    Implementation Record and MaJor Factors Affecting the Project
6.    Civil WrkLs:: All prototype designs for civil works were completed according to the
planned schedule. As Table 5 indicates, the civil works component comprising the
construction of the Bahamas Tourism Training Center (BTTC) Nassau, and the addition of
three workshops at the ITC Freeport were completed satisfactorily. In addition, the
construction of two community skills training centers in the Family Islands at the Crooked
Island Secondary (Crooked Island) and Old Bight Secondary (Cat Island) was completed as
planned, as prototype design plans were ready upon loan approval. However, the construction
of the remining 16 community skills training centers in the Family Ilands was never
completed, even though the architectural designs had been carried out by the Ministry of
Public Works, through a contract with a private firm, according to the planned schedule of



3
November 1990. The tendering process for the Family Islands civil works program was
suspended upon installation of the new Government in the summer of 1992. Education sector
priorities were revised following a detailed sector study commiRsioned by the Government, and
US$16.0 million was allocated to rehabilitate the public schools throughout the country.
Consequently, funds were in short supply to improve access to training as well as for quality
improvement in the underserved Family Islands. Renovations to the 50 existing training
centers were completed as planned, including renovations to the building at CR Walker
Secondary School in Nassau, necessary to accommodate the project-supplied instructional
equipment.
7.     &ipDment: Most of the equipment procured for the lTCs in Nassau and Freeport as
well as for the BTTC Nassau was received and installed according to the planned schedule.
However, because of errors in design arising from lack of liaison between staff involved in
equipment procurement and staff in architectural design work, selected electrical systems
needed to be upgraded in order to permit installation of items requiring three-phase electricity.
The equipment procured for the three new workshops of the ITC in Freeport was installed with
a twelve-month delay because of an equivalent delay in the completion of civil worls. This
delay was largely due to managerial and financial problems encountered by the contractor, and
to irregular payments by the Government. Equipment for the seven new CSTCs in the Family
Islands was duly procured, but was stored pending progress on construction works. Purchase
of equipment for (i) the mobile training program, (ii) the MIS system to be established at the
ITCs, and (iii) the further improvement of the LMIS and expansion of the apprenticeship
management system was approved by the Bank, but has yet to be acted upon by the
Government at the time of project closing. While an effort was made to involve the teachers
(end-users) in the original equipment list preparation, no specific training in the use and
maintenance of materials and equipment has taken place.
S.    Fellowships: Of the about 46 person-months of fellowship programs provided under
the project, 43 person months were actually completed - all being short-term fellowships for
coordinators and instructors of trade industrial (six fellowships) and home economics education
(six fellowships), with the exception of one long-term (equivalent to one year) fellowship to
benefit the labor market information system. The short-term fellowships intended to benefit
arts and crafts instructors did not materialize. In general, the participants' assessment was that
the fellowship programs failed to provide them with the adequate pedagogical skills to design
future training programs, and hence to eliminate their dependency on externl expertise.
Moreover, the issue of a salary adjustment for instructors upon completion of their local
training was discussed at the level of MOHLRAT, and abandoned when the Ministry was
abolished.
9.    Training: Overall training was expanded and upgraded. For instance, enrollment
growth at the ITC, Nassau, has far exceeded appraisal expectastions. From an enrollment of
400-500 in 1988, the lTC grew to 1,300 in 1992, and 2,500 in 1993. The initially-launched
Technical Instructor Training Program, and the Home Economics and Hotel Training
Programs have become ongoing instructional programs and are now part of the summer
training programs. For eight of the ten originally-planned mobile training programs for adults
and out-of-school youth in high demand skills in the Family Islands, curriculum proposals were
received from the technical maistance experts, but have yet to be implemented. The mobile
training units, which were expected to provide flexibility in responding to the training demand
in the islands that had no training facilities, however, were never procured. In addition, the



4
proposal to replace single-skill vocational subjects in the secondary schools by clusters of
related skills (e.g., construction) was only partially carried out. Curricula were prepared and a
workshop was held in the summer of 1991 for 45 instructors, but the training program was not
launched in the Family Islands because of sector policy changes adopted in 1992 and 1993.
10.    I         Develomeo: Institutional development was largely provided through the
provision of technical assistance. The initial objectives of strengthening key agencies in the
education sector were partially achieved. The contracted consultancy services were successful
in helping to establish the labor market information system; to expand the apprenticeship
program to four more trades (out of the originally planned six) - carpentry, masonry, auto
mechanics and auto body repair - in New Providence; and to design Mobile Training
Programs in ten priority areas, Clusters of Related Skills in five priority clusters, the Technical
Instructor Training Program, the Home Economics Teacher Training Program, and a Master
Plan for Post-Secondary Education and Higher Education in the Bahamas. The cost sharing
and cost recovery measures intended to ensure project sustainability have been at the BHTC
although below the levels envisaged at appraisal.1 Inadequate staffing, staff training and
logistical support have hampered the regular production and dissenination of labor market
reports, as well as the full expansion of the apprenticeship program. In addition, lack of
institutional support from the National Advisory Committee for Industrial and Technical
Education and Training (NACITET - formerly the National Training Council), and insufficient
political commitment undermined the implementation of such cost sharing measures in the
Industrial Training Centers. No progress was made in providing for the NACITET to spend
funds on training contracts with employers.
11.   Project Management: The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) housed in the MET, was
headed by a director, and comprised a civil works coordinator and a procurement specialist on
a full-time basis, as well as an accountant on a part-time basis. During the summer of 1992,
the accountant was replaced by a less qualified person. In 1992, with the revised education
sector priorities changed in favor of a massive public school rehabilitation program throughout
the country, the civil works coordinator was transferred to the Ministry of Public Works to
assist in this program. Her project supervisory responsibilities were at first given to the
Ministry of Public Works and then, when this proved unsatisfactory, to a private independent
architectural firm, which had been contracted together with the Ministry of Public Works to
complete the prototype designs for the construction of project facilities (i.e., Bahamas Tourism
Training Center, Industrial Training Centers, Community Skills Training Centers).
12.    rject Costs: At project completion, the total project cost was US$14.2 million
(IBRD: US$7.3 million and Government: US$6.9 million), in comparison to an SAR estimate
of US$17.4 million (IBRD: US$10.0 million and Government: US$7.4 million). The decrease
in cost is largely the result of the lack of execution of the Family Island activities, following
the policy changes implemented by the new Government in 1992. As Table BC indicates, all
expenditure categories (civil works, and equipment and furniture), were affected by the
decrease in project financing.
Student fees cover about 14 peren of the total cost, the balance being borne primarily by the MET, the
Bahama Hotels Association, with the Hotel Workers' Union conatrbting a nominal amount.



5
D.    ProJect       &
13.   The core project objectives were achieved within the expected time frame even though
long-term project sustainability is uncertain with respect to institutional strengthening and
completion of physical components in the Family Islands. Key training institutions -the
Bahamas Tourism Training Center (which houses the Bahamas Hotel Training College under
the MET, the Center for Hotel Training Management of the University of the West Indies, and
the BahamaHost which is under sponsorship of the Ministry of Tourism) the Industrial
Training Centers, and the Community Skills Training Center- were strengthened under the
project, and their role in the economic and social development of the country was increased.
Recurrent cost financing of these training institutions does not seem to pose a significant
problem in the future. However, increased participation of the private sector in the financing
of training, and the introduction of new cost recovery mechanisms were not implemented and
may have been unrealistic objectives to begin with.
E.    Bank Perfoanance
14.   The total time consumed for pre-Board activities was 70 staff weeks (SW) during the
FY87-89 period, or about 23 SW per year. The average time (including field and
headquarters) actually allocated to supervision activities was only five SW per year during
FY89-95, which is about half of the originally planned ten SW (the Bank's norm in the
education sector). On average, the frequency of supervision missions was adequate: two
supervision missions per year were carried out in FY89-90 and FY92-93, as against one
supervision mission in FY91 and FY94-95. With the exception of the first and last two
supervision missions, all other eight missions were carried out by a single Bank contracted
consultant technical educator (fable 13). The quality of project supervision was uneven.
First, the consultant only superficially covered instituion tutoring aspects. Second, the
consultant made no on-site visits, outside Providence and Grand Bahama Islands, conceting
his activities in the capital area. During the first year, the consultant was accompanied by a
Bank Technical Training Specialist to ensure the readiDess of the PIU to launch project
activities in a timely matter (contrary to the first TecVoc Project, which experienced serious
delays in the early implementation years). The last two supervision misions were carried out
by Bank staff, an education specialist, and then an operations officer, who, amng other
activities, reassessed implementation of components related to the civil works, equipment,
institution building, and compliance with legal covenants. At the time of the last mission in
September 1994, the assessment of compliance with Legal Covenants was revised to reflect the
dormant status of the civil works component in the Family Islands, resulting in a unsatisfactory
rating for project development objectives. Supervision reports were prepared following each
mission, but the quality of the reports prepared prior to 1993 was unsafactory. The review
of project performance in terms of achieving the project objectives was weak and project
shortcomings were masked by portraying them as about to be resolved. The Bank, however,
failed to react to these shortcomings until recently. The leson leaned is two-fold: (1) that
supervision reports should clearly document the status of project implemetion; and (2) that
the Bank should carefully supervise the performance of consultants undertacing supervision.

F.    Borrower Performance
15.   The project was the second Bank lending operation in technical and vocational
education implemented by the Borrower. The Borrower's decision to have the PIU established
at the time of negotiations was designed to ensure prompt start up of project activities. Funds,
however, were disbursed at a slower rate than expected during the ear1ier project
implementation years, because of delays in the execution of the Family Island component. The
Borrower has complied with submission of the annual audit reports, even though with
significant delays. The annual reports were punctually prepared and submitted, except for the
Jamnary/June 1994 and the July 1994/June 1995 report, which are still outstanding.2
G.    Assesnent of Outcom
16.   Over the implementation of the project, the atainment of the overall developmental
objectives was consistently rated highly satisfactory, except at the time of the last two missions
when it was rated satisfactory. This difference arose from the fact that the last two missions
undertook a much more searching review including, in the case of the last mission, the only
visit to a Family Island by a supervision mission. At the time of the Loan closing, about 80
percent of initially agreed project components were implemented. However, the construction
of 16 CSTCs in the traditionally neglected Family Islands some of which were expected to be
done during the last year of the project, had not occurred as planned. The Borrower
approached the Bank to request an extension of the Closing Date in order to complete the
implementation of the outstanding project activities. The Bank declined the request on the basis
that the country had graduated in 1988, and would be able to complete project activities using
its own resources. As a consequence, US$2.5 million were cancelled as of October 31, 1995.
H.   Future Operation
17.   The vocational and technical education and training system has significantly improved
since the implementation of the First TecVoc project in 1981, and the subsequently Second
TecVoc project in 1988. Particularly noteworthy are the qualitative and quantitative
improvements in hotel and tourism training programs provided by key instiutions (e.g.,
BHTC, lTCs). In addition, the accomplishments in improving these key institutional
capabilities in terms of planning, implementing and  inig  the training system were
important. Even though access to the training workshops has not expanded as much as
anticipated in the Family Islands, and selected institutional components need additional
strengthening (e.g. LMIS, apprenticeship, private sector involvement), the overall project
outcome is moderately satisfactory. Through careful internal planning, the Government should
be able to make the necessary adjustments to maintain and upgrade the training programs as
labor market needs change to meet the new high technology challenges.
2Fircal Year wau changd fom a calndar year to July/June basis, hence the need for a semiannual report
January/June 1994 to cover the additional six months.

I.  Key Lu. Lmumd
18.   Key lessons learned can be summarized as follows:
* Policy on sector development should be based on detilod sector work, a broader
sta}k older participation and better commiment buildng, which would have minimizd the
risk of major changes in policy at the mid-implemtion  age of the project.
* The Bank should initiate restructuing of projects when political priorities change, in order
to retain ownership.
* Project objectives as defined with the governments in the SAR should be realistic, focused,
and take into consideration the feasibility of achieving major policy and institutional
changes over the short term.
* Supervision missions should be appropriately staffed. Adequate field visits should be
undertaken and supervision reports should accurately document actual progress in ataining
developmental objectives.

lThe delay was due to lsst minute revisions to the bidding documents required by the Bank and the late
issue of the Bill of Quantities.
2 The delay was due largely to the sudden death of the president and principal owner of the contracting
firm, cash flow problems of the contractor and the irTegularity of payments by the Goverment.
3The two centers (Crooked Island and Old Bight) were planned for construction prior to Loan approval.
4Construction of these centers was put on hold by the new Government after the General Elections in
August 1992.

Comment
(1) Dollar figures pkior to FY90 are unavailable. Table nswme~s an average coat of
US$175,0010 per staff year (52 SW) based on the latest FY96 businesls plan rates, thus 1 SW = US$3,365. The
actual supervision staff week (SW) allocation, an average of about 5 SW per year during FY89-95, represents
about half of the original planned 10 SW, and 67% of the revised SW allocation.

A.    Mission's Aide-Memoire:
There has been no special ICR mission. However, the Aide Memoire left
by the last supervision mission (attached) indicates a series of activities to be
performed until the closing of the Loan. Due to the lack of counterpart
funding, activities during the last year came to a halt. A representative of the
Disbursements Department visited Nassau on February 11-12, 1996 to
ascertain the status of funds that might still be aailvble in the special account
#2105060714 opened in the Central Bank wih an allocation of US$500,000.
No Aide Memoire was prepared during this visit, but a back-to-office report
with the findings is attached.

BAHAMAS: SECOND TECHNICAL/VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT (Ln.3004-BM)
Supervision Mission September 26 - 30, 1994
AIDE MEMOIRE
1.    A World Bank mission comprising Mrs. Maria Victoria Lister, Task Manager, and
Mr. Ralph Romain, Education Specialist, visited the Bahamas September 26-29, 1994 for the
purpose of supervision of project implementation and to assess measures needed to bring the
project to a state of completion by the Closing Date of June 30, 1995.
2.    The mission acknowledges with deep gratitude the assistance and courtesies extended
to it by all the Government agencies with which it met.
3.    The mission notes that the Closing Date is fast approaching and that there is a modest
amount of roughly US$2.5 million remaining in the Loan Account that can be used by the
Closing Date to further the objectives of the project. The mission therefore urges that the
Government focus on the steps needed to achieve the full use of these resources to maximize
project impact.
Progress Since Last Supervision Mission
4.    The mission observed that considerable progress in some areas had been made since
the last supervision mission in November 1993:
(a) Civil Works    The ITC (Freeport) and the Tourism Training Center (TTC) complex
have been completed with only some surviving defects to be remedied.
In addition, the renovations to the building at CR Walker Secondary
School, Nassau, necessary to accommodate the project supplied
instructional equipment are almost complete: The requirement under
the Loan Agreement that a full time Civil Works Coordinator be
appointed has been replaced (by agreement with the Bank) by a contract
with an architectural firm.
(b) Equipment      Equipment has been installed at the ITC and TTC; equipment lists
(including the trailers) have been prepared for the Mobile Training
Program and for the automation of the administration of the ITC.
(c) Mobile Training  A coordinator for the Mobile Training Component which had been
lagging behind has been appointed on a full-time basis and he has made
an energetic start on defining equipment needs and cost estimation.
(d) Institutional Strengthening
Well considered proposals to build permanent capacity in Labor Market
Information, the management of the Apprenticeship system,
management of technical/vocational training, and to strengthen the
management of the Industrial Training Centers (ITC) and the Bahamas
Hotel Training College (BHTC) have been put forward; these are
generally in keeping with project objectives and with the
recommendations of the previous supervision mission.



26
(e) Training of Instructors has continued
Training at level 3 has been undertaken for technical/vocational
instructors while the secondary school practical subject teachers have
been trained at both levels 1 and 2. However, as progress has been
made on the issue of salary increments for trained instructors, although
some proposals have been prepared to be submitted to Government.
(f) Advisory Committees
A schedule has been prepared for visits to each of the Family Islands
concemed to discuss the setting up of the Advisory Committees.
MAJOR ISSUES
5.    Several areas of project implementation give cause for concern especially in the light
of the short period of time left for project completion. These include the delays arising from
Government review of sector priorities, the relatively slow pace of execution in regard to the
Family Islands, the best use of the funds remaining in the Loan Account to reinforce project
objectives, special problems concerning project management and the minor (but by no means
negligible) shortcomings regarding civil works and equipment.
Review of Sector Priorities
6.    The project has suffered delays in the past for reasons of Government financial
constraints and hurricane damages. In 1992 a change of Government resulted in a
suspension of certain project items while the new government considered what the new
priorities should be. This affected principally the already delayed Family Islands Component
which had been designed to redress the traditional neglect of these outlying areas. The Task
Force appointed to examine the education system reported in January 1994 and Cabinet has
accepted its far-reaching recommendations. The Task Force had reported, on an interim
basis, that the system required an urgent rehabilitation program for primary schools
especially in the Family Islands, and so the Government launched an extensive school repair
and construction program ($14.8 million in 1993/94) which has continued into this fiscal
year. As a result, budgetary allocations for work on the Family Islands component were
frozen last year and the Government has been slow to make budgetary provision for the
project in the first few months of this FY. It has now decided to allocate the funds needed to
continue project implementation and officials have confirmed that the Government is still
committed to the project but had to respond to the crisis that had developed in terms of
school places in basic education.
Family Islands
7.    Regardless of sector priorities, it was noted that the Family Islands Component
continued to lag behind the rest of the project. The mission noted that virtually no progress
had been made in this component since the last supervision mission while there was progress
in the components in Grand Bahamas and New Providence. Most of the necessary
equipment has been procured and remains in storage.



27
Use of the Balance in the Loan Account
8.    It has become a priority to apply the remaining project investment in such a way as to
maximize project benefits. Accordingly, the mission has consulted with officials and
received proposals in various stages of preparation to achieve institutional strengthening in a
permanent manner in the Ministry of Labor, Human Resources and Training (MOLHRAT).
These have been discussed with Borrower officials and the mission estimates that they are
responsive to project objectives and that they fall within the scope of the remaining resources
available (Annex 1). This should, therefore, guide the various agencies in refining the
details of their proposal.
Project Management
9.    Performance in managing the project has always been satisfactory to the Bank and it
is to be hoped that this will continue. However two problems have arisen that should be
drawn to the attention of the Borrower. The first is that the mission understands that the
contract of the current project director expires at the end of this calendar year, and the Bank
has not to date received proposals from the Government, pursuant to its obligations under the
Loan Agreement, on its arrangements for continuing project management after December 31,
1994. The second is that the mission experienced some difficulty ascertaining the up to date
position regarding the total of commitments (contracts entered into) under the project. In the
forthcoming months, the success in committing all funds by June 30, 1995, the Closing Date,
will depend heavily on up to date information on commitments on a regular and frequent
basis.
Shortcomings Regarding Civil Works and Equipment
10.   Government officials are well aware of the residual problems in completed buildings
that have been handed over and in the installed but non-functional equipment of which
several were discussed with the mission. It is normal to encounter such problems; however,
remedial action is necessary and the role of the Project Unit is crucial in this - in seeking out
and arranging to rectify the situations with the suppliers. The lack of a civil works
coordinator within the Project Unit and of a procurement specialist explains to some extent
why follow-up has not been as swift and decisive as it should have been.
Recommended Action
11.   Bearing in mind the very short time horizon for project execution, namely the need to
ensure that all commitments eligible for financing out of Loan process are entered into before
June 30, 1995 (the Closing Date) and to effect reimbursement by October 31, 1995, the
Borrower should take the following steps urgently and the Bank should promptly respond
where no objections or comments may be required:
(a) The Borrower should prepare and send to the Bank proposals for fellowships
including as far as possible:
(i)   names and resumes of candidates;
(ii)  the proposed training institutions or agencies for attachments or study tours;



28
(iii)  cost estimates for the fellowships; and
(iv)   data on any fellow already sent abroad that the Govemment wishes to include
on the fellowship program.
In order to ensure that Bank comments can be received and given due consideration in
good time, these proposals should be forwarded as soon as each one is available.
(b) The list of new equipment to be procured, (including that for the Mobile Training,
ITC automation, improvement of the LMIS and Apprenticeship) and the estimated
cost should be sent to the Bank as soon as possible. It is noted that some of these
lists have been substantially prepared but not as yet forwarded to the Bank. These
should be completed and sent to the Bank as early as possible.
(c) In respect of the Family Islands - the Borrower should prepare and send to the Bank
by November 1994 its program of action for these schools regarding:
(i)   civil works to be undertaken;
(ii)  the disposition of all of the equipment already procured; and
(iii)  the equipment that is yet to be procured.
In addition, the Borrower should proceed with the establishment of Advisory
Committees and inform the Bank of progress made in the next Semi Annual Progress
Report.
(d) The schedule of accommodation for the proposed Resource Center for the ITC Nassau
and the estimated cost of civil works, furniture and equipment should be sent to the
Bank for its comments by November 1994.
(e) The Borrower should send to the Bank for comment its proposals for filling the
position of Project Director after December 31, 1994; these proposals should reach
the Bank not later than November 1994 to enable the comments of the Bank to be
considered in time to avoid a break in tenure of this key position.
(f) The Borrower should actively follow up the remediation of deficiencies noted in
regard to civil works and equipment at the project institutions and advise the Bank in
the next Semi-Annual Progress Report of the progress made. If necessary a person or
persons should be assigned on a full-time basis to assist the Project Unit in these
matters.

Subject: Second Technical/Vocational Training Project
(Ln 3004-BM)
Dear Mr. Ministers:
I wish to thank the staff of the Ministry of Education and Culture
(MOEC) and the Ministry of Labour, Human Resources and Training
(MOLHRAT) for the cooperation and hospitality extended to the recent
supervision mission composed of Mrs. Maria Victoria Lister and Mr. Ralph
Romain. I am confirming Bank management agreement with the
recommendations made in the Aide-Memoire attached to this letter.
I am pleased to note that considerable progress in some areas had been
made since the last supervision mission. However, areas of concern are the
delays arising from Government review of sector priorities, the relatively
slow pace of execution in regard to the Family Islands, the definition of the
best use of the funds remaining in the Loan Account to reinforce project
objectives, the replacement of the project manager, and the minor (but by no
means negligible) shortcomings regarding civil works and equipment.
Taking into consideration that the closing date of the project is June 30,
1995, and that reimbursements for commitments entered into before that date
can take place until October 31, 1995, it is important to proceed
expeditiously with the plan of action discussed during the mission, and stated
in the Aide-Memoire. As you see, Annex 1 to the Aide-Memoire
summarizes your proposals for fellowships and study tours, but does not
include activities for the Family Islands, for which the Government has yet to
take decisions. Cost estimates indicated in Annex I should be used only as
parameters for your final submittal, which should contain clear details and
costs for each proposed activity.



31
In respect to the Family Islands, a program of action for these schools
should include: (i) civil works to be undertaken; (ii) the disposition of all the
equipment already procured; and (iii) the list of the equipment that is yet to
be procured. The Government's plan of activity for the last year of the
project should be received by the Bank by early November 1994 for review
and comments. In addition, the Government should proceed with the
establishment of Advisory Committees for the Family Islands.
It is imperative that the MOEC writes immediately to the Ministry of
Finance requesting the necessary additional budget allocation for project
implementation.
We would like to draw your attention to the fact that the contract with
the current Project Director expires at the end of this calendar year, and the
Bank has not to date received indications from the Government, pursuant to
its obligations under the Loan Agreement, on its arrangements for continuing
project management after December 31, 1994. Your proposals should reach
the Bank not later than November 1994 to enable the comments of the Bank
to be considered in time to avoid a break in tenure of this key position.
Lastly, the Ministries should actively follow up the remediation of
deficiencies noted in regard to civil works and equipment at the project
institutions. If necessary, a person or persons should be assigned on a full-
time basis to assist the Project unit in these matters.
Sincerely,
Julin Schweitzer

EXT.: 84124
SUBJECT:  BAHAMAS IBRD 3004 - Back to Office Report
According to Terms of Reference dated January 29, 1996, I
visited Nassau, Bahamas on February 11 and the morning of
February 12, 1996 to determine the current status of the subject
special account.
A meeting was held at the Ministry of Education and
Training attended by Ms. Anita Bernard, Permanent Secretary,
Ministry of Education and Training, Mr. L. B. Darville, Project
coordinator until June 1995, Mr. Carleton Blair, Project Director
for IDB and acting Project Director for IBRD's project and Mr.
Benjamin Rahming, Advisor to the Financial Secretary, Ministry of
Finance and Planning. We revisited the purpose of the mission
and was immediately informed that a visit to the Central Bank
would not accomplish its purpose because the "owner" of the
account is the Treasury and as such the only authorized party to
access it. I was further informed that all documents pertaining
to the project would be found at the Ministry of Finance and
Planning.
The afternoon and following morning was spent at the office
of Mr. Rahming in the Ministry of Finance and Planning. Together
with Mr. Darville, we went through the project's files to
identify eligible expenditures paid with special account funds.
Mr. Rahming insisted with his counterparts at Treasury for prompt
submission of the special account latest bank statement which was
sent on Tuesday morning. Upon receipt of the bank statement, it
was determined that as of February 12, 1996, the unutilized
balance in the S/A was $244,273.35. It was agreed that such
amount should be promptly refunded to the Bank. Supporting
documents of eligible expenditures paid from the S/A in the
amount of $187,029.34 were identified. Thus leaving a balance of
$68,697.31 of expenditures paid for with special account funds
for which the documentation was not easily identified or there
was no documentation on files. I informed Mr. Rahming that in
the event that no documentation is found for this differente, the
Borrower would be responsible for refunding $68,697.31.
Summarizing
initial deposit to the S/A                              $500,000.00

less eligible expenditures identified, appl. to be
submitted                                              187,029.34
balance not identified                                  $ 68,697.31
In an effort to assist the Borrower in clearing this issue,
we are reviewing our records, helping reconcile the special
account by identifying individual entries from the special
account bank statement against each application for
replenishment.
Before departing Mr. Rahming showed me: a letter dated
February 13, 1996 awaiting Ms. Ruth Miller, Financial Secretary's
signature addressed to Mr. Schweitzer informing him that the
unutilized balance was being refunded and an internal memorandum
for Ms. Miller's signature requesting Treasury to instruct the
Central Bank of Bahamas to refund $244,273.35 to our account at
Federal Reserve Bank. Specific instructions for the refund were
provided. As of date no refund has been received.
Draft facsimile, following up the mission, for Mr.
Schweitzer's signature is attached.

Dear Mr. Schweitzer,
SECOND TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 3004 - BM)
Further to my letter of even reference dated 19 February, 1996 on the captioned
subject, I submit herewith the Borrower's comments on the draft Project Completion
Report (ICR).
It should be noted that since the Borrower has been making inputs by way of
review of the Bank's drafts (Evaluation Summary, most of Part I and all of Part II)
submitted by Ms. Ines Girsback to Mr. L. B. Darville, Project Director, prior to his
retirement as of June 30, 1995, the draft ICR is therefore considered in part a
collaborative effort of the Bank and the Borrower.
The delay in response to this matter is regrettable.
Yourssicf,
Anita BeA4d

COMMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF THE BAHAMAS
ON THE DRAFT IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT (ICR)
SECOND TECHNICAL AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING PROJECT
(LOAN NO. 3004 - BM)
In paragraph 3 of the PREFACE it is inferred that Ms. Ines Girsback prepared
the ICR. In fact it was in the main a collaborative effort as the Borrower had made
substantial inputs in the initial stages of preparation by way of reviews of drafts
(Evaluation Summary, most of Part I and all of Part II) submitted by Ms. Girsback
to the Project Director (Mr. L. B. Darville) prior to his retirement on June 30, 1995.
C. Implementation Record and Major Factors Affecting Project
6. Civil Works: The inference that the architectural designs for the
community skills training centers in the Family Islands was carried out by the Ministry
of Public Works is incorrect. The designs were done by a private firm (Bruce LaFleur
and Associates) contracted for the purpose with the approval of the Bank.
The $16.0 million allocated by the Government to rehabilitate the public schools
throughout the country included renovations to the 50 existing training centers in the
Family Islands and the remodeling of a building at C. R. Walker Secondary School in
New Providence as a training center to accommodate instructional equipment supplied
under the project. Additionally, during FYs 1993/95 the Government built three
primary schools with capacities for 700 (Grand Bahama), 350 (New Providence) and
100 (Long Island) students each, an extension to a primary school (New Providence) for
350 students, increasing its capacity to 700, a primary school in New Providence for 300
students, and two secondary schools in Grand Bahama for 1,000 students each. The
approximate cost of these infrastructural developments was B$17 ($7 million - a gift
from the Grand Bahama Port Authority towards the construction of the two secondary
schools and $10 million - Government). Consequently, funds were in short supply,
therefore, access to training as well as quality improvement has been less than
anticipated in the Family Islands.
7. Equipment: Equipment was procured at an estimated cost of $160,000.00
for eight new CSTCs in the Family Islands and stored pending progress in construction.
Also, equipment procured at an estimated cost of $20,000.00 for a workshop constructed
outside the project at the Crooked Island Secondary School was also stored as a
commercial supply of electricity is not yet available on the island. Most of the
equipment has been distributed and installed in the workshops in the two new secondary
schools completed and commissioned in Grand Bahama in September 1995. The
remainder is being distributed and installed in existing workshops in secondary schools in
New Providence that did not benefit from assistance under the Bank's First and Second
Technical and Vocational Projects (Loans Nos. 1962 - BM and 3004 - BM).

8. Fellowsh*pa: The inference that the issue of a salary adjustment for
instructors upon completion of their local training was presented to the Govermment and
the Public Service Commission is not correct. In fact, discussions were at the level of
MOHLRAT and were abandoned when that ministry was abolished.
To strengthen the Labour Market Information Unit, a one-year full in-service
award (1994/95) toward a first degree in statistics was given to Ms. Cyprianna Winters at
a cost of US $13,102.59 at the University of South Carolina.
9. Training: The enrollment and output growth at some of the institutions has
far exceeded appraisal expectations especially at ITC (Nassau) and Bahamahost as shown
in Table I below.

10. Institutional Development: While no progress has been made for
NACITET to provide and expend funds on training contracts with employers, ITC
(Nassau) has been engaged in training contracts with the Bahamas Electricity
Corporation which also donated training equipment to the value of $73,000.00 to the
Center, Morton Salt Bahamas, Sandyport Development and the Royal Baharnas
Defence Force.
11. Project Management and Implementation: During the summer of 1992,
the accountant was replaced by less qualified persons and this resulted in somewhat
shoddy record keeping especially since September 1994. An independent architectural
firm, approved by the Bank, was contracted to design BTTC, workshops at ITC
(Freeport), and skills training workshops in the Family Islands, and supervise
construction. Because of the government's massive program of rehabilitation of public
schools throughout the country, the Civil Works Coordinator was transferred back to the
Ministry of Public Works to assist in this exercise and was therefore not able any longer
to supervise the project, but, nonetheless, continued supervision of the construction of
BTTC in collaboration with the independent architectural firm.
Notes on Table la
1. ITCs figures include both full-time and part-time students pursuing 9-month and
3-month programs.
2. Bahamahost figures are approximates representing a cross section of the population
and the program is a 42 to 49-hour training program. Additionally, approximately 250
students in secondary schools were trained during 1993/95, and during the same period
1,600 grade 7 - 10 students were involved in the Tourism Education Awareness Module,
a 10-hour program that familiarizes students with the demands of the hospitality industry.
3. BHTC (Nassau) figures include students in 3-month, Ist, 2nd, and 3rd year programs,
both full-time and part-time. The enrollment and output at BHTC (Freeport) were:
Academic Year         Enrollment             Output
1992/93                154                  118
1993/94                 133                 109
1994/95                 169                 158
These figures include both full-time and part-time students in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd year
programs.
4. UWI-CHTM programmes comprise the second and final years (Level 11) of the
three-year bachelor's degree - B.Sc. in Hotel Management and B.Sc. in Tourism Management.
5. COB's program is a two-vear Associate Degree propram in Tourism (Associate of Applied
Science Dcgree).

On the whole project implementation proceeded satisfactorily until the change of
government in August 1992 when the project was put on hold while the government
was considering new policy directions. As a consequence a National Task Force on
Education was appointed to examine and evaluate the education system and to make
recommendations. The impact on the project was that the Master Plan for Post
Secondary Education, prepared under the project and submitted to government, was
overtaken by the deliberations of the Task Force which revealed an appalling state of
disrepair and under-provision of schools in the country especially in the Family
Islands. This resulted in an emergency program of works for which an allocation of
B$16 was made in the summer of 1993, including the counterpart budget allocation of
B$1.804 million for the project for FY 1993/94. No provision was made in the 1994/95
budget for the project because of financial constraints, consequently the project
component in the Family Islands was cancelled.
12. ProJect Cslta: The total project was US$14.2 million (IBRD: US$7.3
million and Governnent: B$6.9 million). These figures are based on records available.
F. Borrower Performance
It should be noted that semi-annual reports were punctually prepared and
submitted up to February 28, 1994. Subsequent reports up to June 30, 1995 were not
considered necessary as the project, particularly the Family Islands component, was put
on hold and subsequently cancelled. The Bank was fully aware of the circumstances
and status of the project through correspondence from the Borrower prior to the mission
in September 1994 and thereafter.
