A: Project Development Objective
1. Project development objectives and key performance indicators (see Annex 1):
a) Promote institutional reform and demonstrate that client-responsive municipal service improvements can be
stimulated through small efforts and funded on a competitive basis. In particular, to encourage efficient municipal
innovation projects, dissemination of successes and improving central government practices affecting
municipalities. The project fits in the Asia City Development Strategies, that focus on governance and capacity
building; resource mobilization; initiatives towards building a corporate vision 5 year action plan and on urban
growth management; innovations relating to delivery of services to the poor; and improving urban productivity.
b) Key performance indicators will relate to inputs, outputs and impacts, of the objectives:
* number of proposals and number implemented; number of replications;
* workshops, dissemination, awards, public information on innovations;
*  institutional development, including transparency and training.
B: Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goal supported by the project (see Annex I):
CAS document number: 16691-IND   Date of latest CAS discussion: July 10, 1997
The broad objectives mentioned in the CAS and relevant to this project are:
a) Increasing efficiency and productivity in the public and private sectors
b) Enhancing equitable and sustainable development
2. Main sector issues and Government strategy:
Sector issues, as mentioned in the CAS:
a) Improve infrastructure services and reduce their cost
Quality and coverage of urban infrastructure services;
Challenge of rapid urbanization;
Private provision of infrastructure and services.
b)  Promote administrative reform, legal and institutional development
Increase efficiency of urban administrations through improved incentive frameworks;
Improve accountability and transparency and promote city-level responsibilities for development;
Increase local participation in decision-making.
c)  Reduce poverty and inequality
Improve spatial planning (especially land management);
Eliminate distortions and entry barriers in urban housing, employment, and labor markets;
Increase human capital stocks, especially among immigrants and underemployed;
Regularize and support shadow urban economy among the poor.
d) Manage the environment sustainability
Implement existing regulations as relevant;
Promote environmentally friendly technologies;
Develop environmental infrastructure (i.e. sanitation).
Government strategy:
The CAS preceded the economic crisis; however, the basic strategy as mentioned in it remains valid and
innovations, reforms and efficiency gains have increased support at all levels:
a) Decentralization: strengthening municipal planning and management, financial performance and efficiency,



INDONESIA                                       Page 3                     MUNICIPAL INNOVATIONS PROJECT: PAD
incentives to staff and to increase productivity; private provision of services; improving the regulatory
framework; accelerating resolution of land titling questions and simplifying procedures.
b) Reduction of regional disparities, making secondary cities more attractive, assisting the poor with specific
programs.
c) Improvement of environmental sustainability, increasing environmental awareness, enforcing pollution
regulations, improving management of waste and sanitation, making unleaded gasoline widely available to
reduce vehicular emissions.
d) Efficiency gains to reduce costs and increasing cost recovery and revenues, as sector investment needs are
beyond the financing possibilities from local revenues.
3. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices:
Issues to be addressed: The project allows to identify/refine ways of addressing issues falling in any of the
categories above. Ita) encourages municipalities to find locally suitable solutions to their problems, in the context of
the government's overall decentralization process; and b) enables national agencies to assist in finding suitable
approaches for improved local administration, transparency and disclosure, including development of an independent
municipal network. Issues addressed by proposals selected by loan negotiations are described in Annex 2.
Loan type choice: Complementary projects are supporting investments in urban services through standard
processes. A TA project could not have the coverage of a LIL. The project objectives are within the Bank's suggested
uses for a LIL (Board Report R-97-203): a) institutional capacities need to be built up; b) uncharted but promising
areas; c) to pilot potentially good development efforts; d) the policy framework should be good; e) Borrower
commitment and ownership should be strong and the project would generate positive demonstration and more
knowledge. A LIL allows experimentation and flexibility, improvements through trial and error, before municipalities
or central agencies adopt "wholesale" solutions, policies or new regulations that will have wide impacts. The project
preparation process itself provides a basis for new style, demand-driven, performance-related, urban sector loans.

2' Includes PUOD funding for administration of $200,000 equivalent.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project:
The policy and institutional reforms supported by the project, are a) to encourage level 11 agencies to carry out
efficiency-enhancing, innovative, service delivery subprojects, and b) with support from central government agencies
as needed, to carry out pilot projects to improve the administration, transparency in planning and implementation of
expenditures, and disclosure of the performance of agencies at level II. The experiences will be disseminated via
workshops, newsletters and other means; development of an independent network of level II agencies will be
encouraged. Selected staff will be trained towards efficiency enhancement in their agencies. More specifically, the
project aims at:



INDONESIA                                      Page 4                    MUNICIPAL INNOVATIONS PROJECT: PAD
a) motivating and empowering municipal governments to i) introduce efficiency-enhancing procedures; ii) increase
community participation; iii) improve environmental management and greening of the city; iv) improve service
standards by employees; v) introduce innovative approaches expected to have positive impacts on the cities; and
vi) promote decentralization by demonstrating the capacity of local governments;
b) promoting "experimentation" and providing awards for excellence;
c) disseminating municipal lessons across municipalities and supporting development of an independent horizontal
learning network of city managers; and
d) facilitating central government review of some practices affecting municipalities, aiming at simplification,
increased transparency, professionalization of staff.
3. Benefits and target population (see Annex 4):
Indonesia's urban population comprises some 60 million and is growing at more than 5% per year. Of 94
cities (60 kotas and 34 kotips), 10 cities exceed I million inhabitants and some 50 exceed 100,000. Also, 222 districts
include urban areas without city status, managed by the district government. Java has some 65% of Indonesia's urban
population, or 40 million, but even its rural areas are densily populated (the average density is 900 persons per km2).
Thus, improvements in the quality of life or cost reductions in public service provision can have large benefits. The
pilots are bound to have a limited reach but are expected to be sustainable, and could generate large benefits if
replicated widely. The project thus also aims at transparency and information sharing.
Municipal Proposals. The 31 innovation proposals approved by loan negotiations are each from a different
urban area, in 10 cities and 21 districts, in 13 provinces. 23 proposals are from Java's 5 provinces. The proposals
focus heavily on waste management and recycling (14), improving public facilities and space for vendors (6), enabling
economic activities including urban agriculture by community groups (6), promoting tourism and cultural preservation
(3), improving city administration (2)--though most proposals straddle categories. Practically all the proposals involve
the communities, provide public benefits and involve externalities that justify the partial grant financing (below 60%
on average, compared to the maximum of 75% grant allowed under LILs):
a) Recycling waste seems to have gained prominence with economic difficulties. It would improve cleanliness and
health; reduce municipal costs of redressing negative environmental impacts and of landfill and disposal costs;
provide benefits and income to poor people, provide organic fertilizer at lower prices, etc. Recycling programs
typically require some grant funding to cover initial "externalities" and enable subsequent operation to be
commercially viable; operating subsidies are not provided.
b) Upgrading vendor locations with private sector participation, mobilizes private sector resources, generates
revenues and improves the working and hygiene conditions.
c) Developing small business increases incomes of the poor and food availability, and would have good returns and
be sustainable. The submissions reflect the public concern about food price and unemployment increases;
supporting viable economic activities should be preferable to welfare transfers. The grants help finance start up
and demonstration costs and should thus have a multiplier effect.
d) Cultural heritage preservation of old neighborhoods or sites and greening are expected to enhance the cities and
also result in tourism-related benefits.
e) Improving information and urban management (computerization, zoning, digitized mapping, etc.). City planning
and enforcement, administration efficiency and revenues, could all improve.
Innovations promoted by PUOD. PUOD will design and implement pilots to improve administration,
transparency in public finances and disclosure of performance of agencies at level 11. All such improvements could
increase fiscal cost effectiveness considerably; allow the community to exert pressure for efficient delivery of services
and for contracts at fair prices, mobilize community resources in support of demand-driven projects, etc. (no
municipality proposed this type of innovation). 3 pilots have been identified so far, involving activities for which
municipalities tend to need some "external" input: simplification of permit procedures, increase information to the
public on local government activities, and survey of the role and independent financing of an association of agencies at
level II, with the objective of promoting such an association and developing a horizontal network across cities (the
existing association mostly serves a top-down information dissemination function).

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements:
Process of Selecting Municipal Innovations. Because the process of inviting proposals rather than issuing
instructions top down is itself innovative, it is described below.
Initial Workshop. In August 1997 high level officials of the Ministries of Planning, of Finance, of Home Affairs, of Public
Works, Mayors of 23 cities, and foreign agencies active in the field, participated, in a 5 day workshop on improving urban
government--identifying possible innovations in urban governance, what support they would require and how interested agencies
were in shouldering new responsibilities. Well known speakers, a US governance expert and a successful Philippine mayor,
presented best practice approaches to municipal management in those countries.
Request for Innovative Proposals. Because of the interest generated during the workshop, PUOD suggested the project. First, to
some 50 City Managers, heads of Bappeda II, Bupatis and representatives from local agencies at a meeting December 16, 1997.
Early February 1998 PUOD invited all local governments to submit proposals. By early March some 140 proposals had been
received, though not all were truly "innovative", since this was a new initiative. Thus, PUOD held another meeting March 17,
1998 for discussion, exchanges of views and a "proposal writing" exercise; 156 representatives from 23 provinces attended, more
than had been invited. In the end, some 300 proposals were submitted. To allow more local proposals, it was agreed to pursue the
one stop permit under other projects, even though this was the original objective for the project.
Selection of Innovations. On June 15, 1998 a technical team chaired by the Director of PUOD and comprising representatives of
the above mentioned ministries, established the selection criteria as follows:
General criteria: a) maximum $100,000 grant; b) maximum 2 year implementation period; c) sufficient local funding; d)
sustainability; and e) innovative.
Specific criteria, at least 2 complied with for improvement in: a) service delivery, b) city management, c) efficiency and cost
reduction; d) environment; and e) staff.
Selection by an independent committee comprising 8 experts in various fields from a university, a technical institute, the
Association of Municipalities, NGOs, a Chamber of Commerce, and a newspaper. Proposals with more than 4 votes became the
top list (38, from 37 municipalities in 13 provinces), and proposals with 4 votes (20) became a secondary list. At appraisal it was
agreed to limit each municipality to one innovation grant, to include municipalities from the secondary list not already in the top
list, and to include a few more "city management" proposals; the total selected was thus 46.
Verification. The 46 proposals were reviewed on site, some by the relevant expert of the committee, and some by Bank staff. Cost
estimates had greatly increased due to the 80% inflation in 1998. Ultimately, only 31 proposals were retained (but more are
envisaged later).
The pilots to be started by PUOD will also invite cities to participate, and to define further pilots.
Implementation
Implementation period: A 3 year project period is allowed for implementation of the proposals, including some to be
defined during early project implementation, and for a learning and dissemination period.
Implementation agencies: PUOD is the executing agency of the project. It will have a small project management unit,
PMU, supported by technical assistance for administration, verification of proposals, supervision, coordination across
agencies, reporting, etc. PUOD will provide the administration budget for the PMU's costs related to project
management and implementation, expected to be some 3% of the project cost or US$200,000 equivalent. Municipal
agencies will implement the innovations. Terms of reference have been agreed for TA for the PMU.
Procedures: The project allows demand-driven participation by municipal agencies, and competition for funds. Upon
final verification of the proposals including compliance with any required environmental and acquisition guidelines,
self-financing, availability of expertise, and other criteria, each participating municipality will sign an Implementation
Agreement (Annex 12) with PUOD including applicable environment and resettlement guidelines (Annexes 13 and
14). Agencies have to self-finance at least 25% of the cost, not necessarily in cash, as to be detailed in the Agreement.

will have an office where the public can see and request information on the initiative. The PMU will list grant winners
in national and provincial newspaper articles (including in the non-winning provinces) and will disseminate
information and progress reports to relevant ministries and cities. For its own pilots the PMU will follow standard
procedures and for training, it will seek new ways such as twinning, placing selected trainees in foreign agencies after
intensive English courses in Indonesia, etc.
Procurement: All contracts are expected to be small, short term and to require simple processes. Only national
shopping procedures are expected to be required for goods, and small work procedures for works. The first 5 contracts
for works and goods will be subject to prior review by the Bank. The PMU will handle procurement for workshops,
dissemination, hiring of the award committee, and other activities, such as hotel payments, etc. that are also expected
to be relatively minor each time, under service contracts. PUOD will procure the TA it needs for the PMU and for its
sponsored pilots. Training abroad is expected to receive support from foreign sources. Procurement will follow the
Bank Guidelines, as indicated in Annex 6.
Disbursements: The loan proceeds will be disbursed through a Special Account to be opened in Bank Indonesia, with
an initial deposit of $300,000, and a ceiling of $500,000 or 10% of the loan amount. The Special Account will disburse
directly to the municipal agency, and advance against the signed Implementation Agreement as indicated in the
Agreement; a second payment upon presentation of a progress report and SOEs for purchases made and services
obtained with the advance, and the balance upon completion of the innovation, certified by the PMU. The funds will
be grants to the municipalities, and provide incremental funding. The PMU will request the Bank Indonesia to pay
directly its own suppliers, consultants and service providers.
Monitoring and evaluation: Monitoring will be carried out by the PMU. Independent reviews of activities financed
by the loan can be commissioned by PUOD from community and non-profit organizations, researchers, etc. The press
and foreign agencies involved in municipal aspects will be inforned of the innovations and invited to review them.
Findings will be made available to the public. The Bank will supervise the project by undertaking short and frequent
visits to review implementation on site, participating in workshops and dissemination activities, reviewing new
proposals, etc.
Annual reviews: The Bank will conduct annual reviews to a) ascertain progress with the innovations, whether changes
are needed or even whether the grant balance for a particular innovation should be canceled; and b) to review the PMU
performance.
Audits: BPKP will undertake annual audits by September 30, as is standard under Bank-financed projects.
Awards: In the second half of the year 2000, independent experts will be tapped (and paid) to evaluate innovations,
both under this project and other innovations as may be identified, focusing on the following objectives: a) improved
urban management and service delivery including efficiency and cost reduction, b) better poverty and community
programs, c) environmental improvement,- and d) staff enhancement. Three Awards for Excellence would be given in
a high-profile ceremony, that will also provide a forum for participating manager discussions, and publicized to
enhance interest. Awards are to be defined.
D: Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection:
Eight standard SILs are assisting various urban areas. An Urban Poverty Project is proceeding in parallel to
the proposed LIL. A LIL allows learning and innovation to both the country and the Bank. Replicating one type of
innovation (i.e. the one roof permit system) in several municipalities, as first intended, would have made an easier
project but will be pursued elsewhere, in order to open choices to municipalities under the LIL. Then, given the
number of submissions, a loan larger than the $5 million ceiling for LILs would have been desirable (only some 40
subprojects can be financed from more than 300 proposals). However, the Bank can follow up with other urban loans.

The experience of a small loan in Indonesia is useful; this has fostered a demand-based and incentives-driven
competition, responsive to local needs, and enhances responsibility of municipalities. The leverage is larger.
2. Major related projects financed by the Bank and/or other development agencies (completed, ongoing and planned):

GTZ and USAID related projects (see table above) are under PUOD, and this facilitates coordination. The
Bank is also coordinating with foreign agencies involved in the municipal area.
3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design:
The standard process of central approval for financing of municipal programs, at least one year in advance,
reduces flexibility and taking advantage of opportunities. Accountability is to the central source of funding rather than
to urban residents; incentives to perform are few. Innovations are too dependent on central initiatives (and the issues of
administration and legal reform, have not been addressed much). Private sector/community consultation and
participation are limited by the system, even though some local agencies have shown ability and interest in increasing
them. Local financing is seldom available for new approaches or unprogrammed activities; there are few incentives
and many risks for local governments to deviate from instructions. Thus, this small project is designed to encourage
staff to try new approaches without perhaps having to beware of penalties for deviating from standard procedures, or
for not succeeding.
Efforts to encourage horizontal learning among city managers that have been or are being supported by the
World Bank in Latin America, and by Ford Foundation and the US in the Philippines, are reported to have produced
high returns.
4. Indications of Borrower commitment and ownership:
The time for innovation is right. The "reformation" door has been opened by a new regime and popular
demand seeking more efficiency, accountability and transparency, all features that are known to improve public
service delivery and responsiveness. PUOD has processed project preparation well. Participating city managers noted
that being asked to propose ideas for better urban management by the central or foreign agencies, was a novelty. The
selected agencies are committed to the innovations and have the required counterpart funds.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project:
The Bank helped organize and finance the workshop that helped provide an impetus to the municipal dialogue



INDONESIA                                        Page 8                      MUNICIPAL INNOVATIONS PROJECT: PAD
and information sharing, and triggered the project. PUOD requested in November 1997, that the Bank support
adopting widely the one stop permit that was successful at Gianyar. Later the project scope was broadened. LILs were
to be fast processing; however processing this LIL in the Bank (the first for East Asia), turned out to take as long as a
SIL. Despite the small amount of the loan, the Bank should provide standard supervision resources and it can facilitate
Indonesian cities' access to international experience and agencies and to independent experts to rule on awards, and
can itself learn to design better urban projects. Also, the new preparation process in the country strengthened
collaboration across agencies.
E: Summary Project Analysis (Detailed assessments are in the project file, see Annex 8)
1. Economic (supported by Annex 4):
[ I Cost-Benefit Analysis: NPV= n.a. ; ERR= n.a. [ ] Cost Effectiveness Analysis: n.a.
[x] Other
Given that this project is heavy on externalities, experimentation and learning, a quantified economic analysis
ex ante would be spurious. Only some 40 proposals can be funded and could thus be carefully selected; they were
further reviewed prior to approval and this should minimize the risk of failure (while failing may still be "good
performance" in the pilot). The innovations would lead to sustainable improved municipal management, information
and communication; more efficient and effective service delivery with a positive environmental impact; increased
private sector and community participation; increased local empowerment and transparency. The proposals submitted
for funding included a description of expected benefits, sustainability, etc. Summaries in English of all proposals and
their justification, have been prepared and are in the project file. The innovations have high potential returns, both for
the public and the private sectors.
The US$7.2 million project cost is a small fraction of municipal expenditures in Indonesia. The potential for
replication of successes is large. An economic analysis will be prepared when results become available.
2. Financial (Annex 5): N.A. NPV= n.a.; FRR= n.a.
Fiscal impact: The project would reduce the need for fiscal resources as the innovations seek efficiency
improvements, private and community involvement, and so on. The loan proceeds are grants to the local agencies.
The MoF will repay the loan through general revenues. It is expected that the innovations will yield economic benefits
exceeding the deadweight loss of tax collection for general revenues, and allowing full economic cost recovery of the
innovation grant in a few years. As expenditures will be in rupiah, the loan also provides balance of payment support.
3. Technical. N.A.
Experts including from the Bank participated in the proposal verification process. The innovations proposed
may not be "cutting edge" by available technical standards, but are new and beneficial to the municipalities. Proposal
implementation is expected to require consultants but few technical difficulties. TORs for TA each agency may need
to implement the innovation, will be reviewed.
4. Institutional:
The project preparation process has in itself been innovative and it advances the decentralization and increased
transparency objectivesl. Municipalities will be encouraged to modernize and be more efficient; to use more
I   This summarizes an earlier PAD section on Institutions, for easy reference: The process started with a high profile
Seminar for Innovative Mayors held in August 1997. Thereafter, for the first time a) Mayors and Bappedas 11 were invited to
compete for grant funds on the basis of their own submissions (following prescribed criteria) and the response was 400 proposals
from 121 municipalities (out of 304) within 3 months; b) a 2 day workshop was held to assist local agencies improve submissions,
in both content and presentation, that was a good learning experience and resulted in 159 revised submissions; c) an independent
committee ranked the proposals taking into account criteria established by a technical committee, and verified the selected
proposals on location; and d) selected proposals will be publicized in national and provincial newspapers.



INDONESIA                                     Page 9                     MUNICIPAL INNOVATIONS PROJECT: PAD
horizontal networking, increased information flows across and within municipalities and from external databases; to
increase public disclosure and interaction with the public. All this should have a stimulating effect, not to mention
economic benefits. Awards for excellence are also important in Indonesia. The project includes initiatives both arising
from local agencies and some better sponsored by a higher level agency; the results will be monitored. Some selected
staff will be trained to enhance professionalism of their agencies. These pilots should help the process of major
institutional reforms envisaged by the Government.
5. Social and resettlement:
[ ] list issues below  [ ] to be defined         [x] No issues
The Bank's guidelines for resettlement and compensation (Annex 13) apply to any proposal under the project
that involves land or asset acquisition and are part of the Implementation Agreement of the implementing agency with
PUOD. Where acquisition is needed, compliance will be required prior to releasing of grant funds. Little involuntary
resettlement is expected in any approved proposal; urban upgrading is supported, rather than moving people out of
their neighborhoods. No proposal is expected to require an Action Plan.
6. Environmental assessment: Environmental Category     [ ] A   [x] B  [] C
Project innovations are expected to involve only small scale works, and to enhance the environment rather
than have a negative impact. The GOI's environmental procedures and criteria, especially those of Dinas PU, will
apply; this means essentially incorporating good practice designs, and more challenging, enforcing the rules.
Indonesia's rules are in line with the Bank's environmental guidelines, as summarized in Annex 14, that will be
attached to the Implementation Agreement where relevant. Compliance with rules in designs will be sought prior to
releasing an advance; and compliance in works will be supervised by the PMU and by others; attention will be placed
on improving the standard operating procedures and public consultation and disclosure.
7. Participatory approach [key stakeholders, how involved, and what they have influenced; if participatory approach
not used, describe why not applicable].
a) Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups are identified on each proposal, and are largely from poor
population segments.
b) Participation prevails in the project, in the sense of municipalities sharing this process, and in the proposals
involving the communities in planning, implementation and benefits, rather than being top down.
F: Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability:
The project provides grants to the municipalities, but these have to finance at least 25% of the cost and are
expected to find funding for sustained operation after the project, through standard municipal budgets or privatization.
The PMU will prepare brief, easy-to-read summaries of innovations that can be disseminated through a newsletter,
regional seminars, the Web page, and consultations during Home Affairs meetings in Jakarta. The Press Corps will be
invited to share the project evolution. Transparency is considered important for sustainability of improvements.
Innovations that fail, should be publicized no less than successes, in order to avoid replicating potential failures.
Incentives should be provided to replicate efficiency improvements that also reduce funding needs.

3. Possible Controversial Aspects:
Given the objectives of the project no major controversy is expected. The loan is small despite suggestions for
a larger size. It provides balance of payment support given that most project expenditures will be incurred in rupiah.
Grant financing would be desirable, but is not available.

Annex 2
Municipal Innovations Project
Project Description
Municipal Innovation Subprojects (US$ 6.45 million total cost, and grants of a maximum of $100,000
equivalent each). Two types of subprojects are foreseen:
a) efficiency-enhancing innovative service delivery subprojects proposed by agencies level 11 and approved by the
central selection committee; grants would help in financing consultants, non-profit organizations, TA by other
agencies, service providers and procurement of goods and works, to prepare and implement the innovations. Most
suppliers are expected to be Indonesian. The cost of preparing the proposal submitted to the selection committee is
borne by each agency. The grants will not finance any value added tax. Grants will be a maximum 75% of the cost of
the proposals; so far local contributions exceed 40%. The list of selected proposals. is in attachment.
b) pilots to improve the administration, transparency in planning and implementation of expenditures and disclosure of
the performance of local agencies, initiated and supported by the central government. So far 3 pilots have been
identified and will be pursued by PUOD: i) simplification of permit procedures at Pemda TkIl, ii) survey of the role
and independent financing of a Pemda Tkll association, and iii) increase in information to the public of Pemda Tk 11
activities.
Institutional Development (US$ 0.7million total cost). TA and services for project implementation, mainly for
expenditures to be incurred by the PMU, as follows:
a) Strengthening the PMU (up to $250,000 equivalent for TA and $200,000 equivalent for operating expenses).
PUOD requires a full time expert in urban matters, a management information systems expert and an assistance
level person. Short-term experts may also be required. Terms of reference and a shortlist will be agreed; due to
the small amount involved direct appointments would be acceptable according to Bank procurement rules. PUOD
will provide office space, telephone, fax, travel as may be needed to the cities implementing the innovations,
workshops, etc. over the 3 year project period, starting at signing of the project loan. PUOD will also assign its
own staff as needed for project administration. (Other agencies participating will have to pay for their operating
expenses, that are not included in the project cost.)
a) Cost of jurors and awards for excellence (up to $50,000 equivalent). High caliber experts will be hired to visit
innovation sites and choose the 3 best (in the categories urban management; poverty programs; environmental
management; competitive services; training). A total of some 3 m-m may be needed in the year 2000; the cost of
travel will also be financed under the loan as would awards in the form of study trips or other selected awards.
b) Cost of workshops and dissemination of innovations (up to $100,000 equivalent under the loan). The loan
proceeds would cover travel and accommodation, but not bonus payments for attending workshops. It is expected
that the agency managers will fund partially these activities. Costs of central government staff attending
workshops would be covered by the respective agency. Journalists who report on the innovations would not be
paid under the project; their expenses would be expected to be covered by their respective newspapers.
c) Training (up to $100,000 equivalent). Staff interested in innovating and professionalizing their agencies, would be
selected to attend training in foreign agencies, and as may be required, to study English first. Foreign agencies are
being identified particularly in Australia and New Zealand, willing to accept Indonesian trainees and perhaps pay
them a salary to defray costs. It is expected that at least 20 trainees will benefit each year from the program.

Proposals Selected by Negotiations and their Benefits
WEST JAVA PROVINCE (Total requested assistance Rp. 5,024,825)
I. Kabupaten Bogor: The local government proposes to reduce the impact of animal waste in the Cibinong and Depok
slaughter houses by processing the waste into compost and livestock feed with vermiculture and other appropriate
technologies.
2. Kotamadya Sukabumi: The local government in collaboration with the private sector and NGOs will separate and
process wastes. Organic wastes will be used for livestock feed and fertilizers whereas non-organic wastes will be sold as
raw materials for related industries.
3. Kabupaten Subang: The Office of Cleansing and Parks, in cooperation with LKMD and the association of farmers, will
process human wastes in the IPLT site in Kampung Cibarola. Wanareja village, into fertilizers. The project is expected
to reduce farmers' expenditures on fertilizers and to increase local revenues through retribution of human wastes
collection.
4. Kabupaten Majalengka: Neighborhood association or "RT"-based cooperatives will be established in the villages of
IKK towns (capital of Kecamatans), to have savings and credit systems to manage solid waste. Seven IKK will be
covered as pilots: Majalengka, Kadipaten, Dawuan, Talaga, Cikijing, Jatiwangi, and Rajagaluh. The project would
expand the solid waste service coverage from the existing 4,000 households to 28,000.
5. Kodya Cirebon: Local government, together with LKMD, NGOs and others, will cultivate the unused land located near
the Penggung airport in Kelurahan Kalijaga to produce commodities needed by existing agro-based industries such as
ketchup factories, etc. It is expected that 1,000 farmers would be involved in this.
6. Kabupaten Cirebon: Bappeda Tingkat 11 and other relevant agencies plan to establish an economic development area in
Panguragan town that integrates fish, fruits, livestock feed and chicken processings and reuse/recycling activities. The
linkages among each of the processing activities would reduce waste and environmental pollution, reduce production
costs and create jobs for 40 people directly and 160 people indirectly.
DKI JAKARTA (Total requested assistance Rp. 2,197,600)
7. Kodya Jakarta Timur: Local government, in collaboration with the private sector including the association of chicken
collectors and slaugtherers, plans to establish a central place for chicken collection and slaughter, equipped with
adequate infrastructure and facilities to ensure good meat quality and to reduce pollution in the densely populated
neighborhoods where chicken slaughtering is presently taking place. The location of such a center will be in Kelurahan
Jatinegara, Kecamatan Cakung.
8. Kodya Jakarta Utara: Local govemment and the association for poultry husbandry will collect restaurant and fish

Annex 6
Municipal Innovations Project
Procurement, Disbursement and Auditing Arrangements
Procurement
Procutrement methods (Table A)
Procurement of works and goods will follow the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA
Credits" dated January 1995, and revised in January and August 1996 and September 1997. Standard Bidding
Documents will be used for all Bank-financed procurement. Employment of consultants and the format for consultant
contracts will be based on the "Guidelines for Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers"
of January 1997, as revised in September 1997.
Consultants, services, goods and works procutred through the Municipal Innovation Grants
The maximum allocation under the project to a municipal agency is $100,000 equivalent, and it is to cover
consultants, services, goods and works, as may be needed for preparing and carrying out the innovation. Each
municipal innovation approved will have a Municipal Innovation Agreement between the PMU and the recipient
agency (Annex 12), inter alia, describing procurement needs and plans.
Consultants. Local agencies can use a) Direct Appointment (single source selection) procedures for
individuals for up to $50,000 equivalent, and for firms for up to $100,000 equivalent; these ceilings would not be
exceeded under the project given the total amount available per agency; b) Selection Under a Fixed Budget (para. 3.5
of the guidelines) and c) Selection Based on Consultant Qualifications (para. 3.7 of the guidelines).
Goods. Goods shall be procured under contracts awarded on the basis of National Shopping procedures.
Quotations must be obtained from at least 3 qualified suppliers on the basis of a detailed description and quantity of
goods, as well as the desired delivery time and place. (this would include travel, though on some air routes only one
airline may provide service).
Works. Works, that will fit under the Bank procurement category of small works given the ceiling of the
grant, will be contracted under lump-sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three
qualified domestic contractors in response to a written invitation. The invitation shall include a detailed description of
the works, including basic specifications, the required completion date, a basic form of agreement acceptable to the
Bank, and relevant drawings, where applicable. The award shall be made to the contractor who offers the lowest price
quotations for the required work, and who has the experience and resources to complete the contract successfully.
Constultants and Services procured through the PMUfor project implementation and pilots
Given the small amounts involved, procurement by the PMU will be by direct appointment/single source
selection of consultants for implementation assistance and for pilots or by direct purchase of goods/services (up to
$100,000 for firms and $50,000 for individuals allowed in Bank rules). Each contract is expected to cost less than
$20,000 equivalent. Nevertheless, the PMU is expected to search for competitive offers for travel, workshop inputs,
dissemination and other services for the project, such as the selection ofjurors to determine award winners.
As is customary, the Bank will approve the TORs for consultants, and may at that time request a shortlist of
candidates if the Bank considers this useful. Selections will be based on consultant qualifications or under a fixed
budget. The PMU plans for workshops, dissemination and other project activities would also be submitted to the Bank
for prior review.

Prior review thresholds (Table B)
There will be 5 prior reviews of procurement under the Innovation Grants (the first five) given the small
amounts involved in any one expenditure, and the delays that the prior review procedure could entail. At least one
third of the Implementation Agreements will have contracts reviewed ex-post; contracts and their implementation will
routinely be reviewed during project supervision and findings recorded in the aide memoires.
Consultant contracts by the PMU, both for implementation/management assistance and for new pilots, will be
reviewed by the Bank prior to approval. The total expenditures subject to prior review would amount to $650,000
equivalent.
Procurement plans
Each Implementation Agreement includes a section on procurement. This will be reviewed in the final
verification of proposals and discussed and agreed prior to the signing. The Bank may participate in some of the
discussions.
Disbursements
Allocation of loan proceeds (Table C)
Mu(nicipal Grants: When the Implementation Agreement is approved/signed, the implementing agency
receives a 40% advance from the grant, in accordance with the terms of the Implementation Agreement. Upon
presentation of the progress report to the PMU and accounting satisfactorily for the use of the initial 40% and the
agency's own contribution, the agency receives a further 40%. Upon presentation of the completion report to the
PMU, the final 20% of the grant (or the needed balance if the cost turned out to be less) is disbursed. This entails
some 100 small disbursements from the SA, but avoids intermediaries such as Pimpros and regional KPKNs and
concomitant agency costs and paperwork.
Expenses by the PMfU:. Requests for payment approved by the PMU on contracts for the project, would be
paid by the SA directly to the consultant or supplier, designated bank accounts.
Use of statements of expenses (SOEs): Disbursements will be against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) for
all municipal innovation grants; services for the implementation centers which would include goods, works and
service delivery contracts; individual consultants less than $50,000 equivalent and consulting firms less than $100,000
equivalent. Documentation for these expenditures will be retained by the PMU and made available to the Bank and
auditors on request. All other disbursements from the loan will be fully documented.
Special Account: GOI will establish a Special Account at Bank Indonesia, denominated in US dollars, with an
authorized ceiling of $500,000. The Account will be managed by the Directorate General of Budget, Ministry of
Finance. The initial advance will be $300,000 upon loan effectiveness; the account will be replenished on a monthly
basis, or when 20% of the authorized ceiling has been disbursed, whichever occurs first.
Flov of Funds. The PMU would be responsible for authorizing the project expenditures in accordance with the
agreed budgets under existing government procedures. They will submit their payment requests to their respective
MoF Treasurer (KPKN) who will issue payment remittance orders (SPM) to Bank Indonesia to credit payees'
accounts at the latter's respective banks and to debit the project Special Account.
The DG Budget will provide KPKN with guidelines and criteria for eligible project expenditures, in
accordance with the Loan Agreement. All the required forms necessary to submit payment requests and the relevant
documentation are standard and are currently applicable to all foreign-funded projects. KPKN will provide copies of
the payment remittance orders (SPM) and other supporting documents to the DG Budget regularly, against which the
applications for disbursement will be prepared.

Annex 13
Municipal Innovations Project
Land Acquisition and Resettlement Guidelines
Introduction
GOI regulations relevant to land acquisition, resettlement and compensation, that would guide the agencies
for this project as they do for others, are:
a)  Keppres 55/1993 pertaining to land provision for development for public interest;
b)  Implementing Regulation for Keppres 55/1993, #1/1994 of the Min.of Agri./Nat'l Land Agency (BPN);
c)  Regulation 4/1991 of the Min.of Land/head of BPN regarding land consolidation;
d)  Letter 410-4245/1991 of the Min. of Land /head of BPN, and
e)  Circular 410-1078/1996 of the Min.of Agriculture/head of BPN on technical guidelines for land consolidation.
In general, where a proposal entails land or asset acquisition, the project agency/group shall ensure that any
persons affected negatively by the proposed subproject are compensated such that their incomes and assets are
restored or improved under the subproject.
Basic principles
The basic principles for the project are:
i) proposals should avoid or minimize land and asset acquisition as well as involuntary resettlement. They should
have explored viable altemative designs to minimize displacement.
ii) under approved proposals, any negatively affected person, under any tenure category, should be given fair
compensation determined through consultation and agreement between the affected party and the project group.
iii) the affected person should be able to choose the type of compensation, in the form of cash or in kind; the level
should be based on current market prices or updated NJOP (tax base) values for their property, for cash
compensations, and should provide land and housing at least equal to the replaced ones, when compensation is in
kind.
iv) proposals that would affect 200 persons or more require a full LARAP (land acquisition and resettlement action
plan). (Such subprojects would normally entail long lead times, and are expected to be beyond the scope of the
project.)
v) there shall be no land acquisition under the project through land consolidation procedures.
Procedures
i) proposals have to indicate the need for land acquisition, the estimated size and number of persons affected, and
the estimated budget required for compensation. Such identification can be conducted in parallel with the
AMDAL (see environmental guidelines).
ii) proposals approved in principle by the consultant that require land acquisition, shall be complemented as
necessary with a LARAP (Land acquisition and resettlement action plan) and indication of the budget source for
the required compensation (proceeds of the kelurahan grant cannot be used for compensation), carry the approval
by the relevant kabupaten agency head. The consultant shall seek the Bank's approval of the LARAP and budget,
and seek modifications in case the Bank finds they are needed.
iii) any LARAP or compensation shall be completed satisfactorily prior to the start of any construction work. The
implementing group will report progress regularly to the PMU, that in turn will inform the Bank.
Sanctions
If it is found that the guidelines were not complied with, then funding for the subproject will be cancelled and
the Kelurahan will not be eligible for any other financing under the project.

The Bank's Operational Directive on Environmental Assessment (O.D.4.0 1), which in general is in line with GOI's
AMDAL process for public projects, shall also be followed by the agencies where a proposal entails any negative
environmental impact, to ensure that it is mitigated or avoided satisfactorily. No new environmental management
procedures are proposed. The Bank also requires public disclosure of environmental reports (BP 17.50, Disclosure of
Operational Information).
Basic principles
The basic environmental principles are:
i) proposals should avoid or minimize negative environmental impacts. They should have explored viable alternative
designs to minimize the impact;
ii) the proposal should fit into the General Spatial Plan (RUTR), and avoid protected areas so designated by the
Ministry of the Environment (attachment I to this annex) unless the proposal improved a protected area;
iii) proposals entailing a negative environmental impact, shall be complemented by an environmental plan to mitigate
the impact.
Procedures
There are three key stages (studies for the proposal, design and implementation), all three involving public
consultation. The procedures at each stage are summarized below (a checklist for the agency is in attachment 2):
In an initial screening, the project type, scale, location, and sensitivity, and the nature and magnitude of potential
impacts, will be identified to classify the proposal in one of 4 categories:
i) those that require environmental management and monitoring plans (UKL and UPL)based on limited but site
specific studies. The Ministry of Public Works has set criteria to determine the need for UKL/UPL, and the

Ministry of the Environment has set criteria for ANDAL. Both sets are combined in attachment 2 to this annex;
ii) those for which standard operating procedures (SOP) suffice. where generic good practice would protect the
environment adequately. DG Cipta Karya and DG Bina Marga have SOP guidelines for some types of projects2:
iii) those that require no environmental study. where no construction. disturbance of land or water or discharge of
pollutants are involved;
iv) those that require a full environmental assessment (ANVDAL) plus environmental management plan (RKL), unless
the ANDAL and the RKL were the innovations (due to the small financing for the proposals, none is expected to
be in this category for implementation).
In the design stage:
i)  the fit with urban planning and the environmental studv, if these are needed, should be approved by the Bappeda
and Bapedalda prior to submission to the PMU;
ii) the environmental management should be incorporated into the designs, tender documents and contracts;
iii) standard field inspection, operating guidelines and management and monitoring for municipality staff (or private
sector operators) should be clear;
iv) the institutional arrangements for implementation and funding sources should be indicated in the proposal.
Implementation would proceed after the proposal is approved by the PMU and the Bank.
Public participation
For projects for which ANDALs must be prepared, GOI's regulations require public disclosure of information
about the project and opportunities for public comments before a final decision is taken. There are no provisions for public
participation in UKL/UPL preparation. The Bank requires public disclosure also of UKL/JPLs, and encourages
participation of NGOs and affected communities in all project planning. Municipalities are advised to provide a
mechanism to receive and respond to complaints from the public for any subproject that may cause environmental or social
impacts.
Attachment 1
List of Protected Areas
The Decree of the Minister of State for the Environment of the Republic of Indonesia Number KEP-
39/MENLH/8/1996 Concerning the Types of Businesses or Activities Required to Complete an Environmental Impact
Assessment prescribes that any business or activity that is located in a protected area or that may change the purpose and/or
designation of a protected area shall be required to prepare an ANDAL, It includes:
i)   forest protection areas:                         i)   river edges;
ii)   marine/freshwater conservation areas;           ii)   nature tourism parks;
iii)  peat areas;                                     iii)  areas surrounding lakes and reservoirs;
iv)   coastal mangrove areas;                         iv)   cultural reserves;
v)   water catchment areas;                           v)   areas surrounding springs;
vi)  national parks;                                  vi)  scientific research areas;
vii)  coastal edges;                                  vii)  nature conservation areas;
viii) forest parks;                                   viii)  areas susceptible to natural hazards.
- Such as measures to control dust, noise and traffic at construction sites, specifications for backfilling and revegetating
disturbed areas to prevent erosion; procedures to control negative impacts at solid waste transfer stations; etc.
