TURKEY
NORTHERN FORESTRY PROJECT
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT
I. FORESTRY SECTOR
A. Introduction
1.01      A description of Turkey's forest resources and a discussion of
their development potential was included in two previously published Bank
Appraisal Reports: 240a-TU of 1973 and 1046a-TU of 1976, relating to the
Akdeniz Forest Utilization and Balikesir Newsprint Projects respectively.
This section briefly summarizes the more important highlights of relevance
to the project.
B. Population and Forest Resources
1.02      Land classified as forest occupies about 20 million ha or one
quarter of Turkey's total land area. The forest resources are the fourth
largest in Europe and the Middle East excluding European Russia. The principal
forests are located in the mountain ranges and hills near the Black, Aegean
and Mediterranean Seas; there are few high forests in the central and eastern
plateaus; there are sizeable areas of scrub forest in the east, northeast and
southeast regions; about half of the forest area is classified as high forest
and about half of this is considered as productive. The remainder is classi-
fied as coppice, of which about 20% is productive. The forests of Northern
Turkey are predominantly of mixed, coniferous/deciduous type. Species of com-
mercial significance include Fir (Abies spp), Pines (Pinus nigra and brutia),
Beech (Fagus spp) and Oak (Quercus spp . Turkey's forest areas include 16,000
forest villages containing 1.3 million families and a total population of about
8 million people. This is roughly 20% of the country's total population and
about one-third of its rural population.
1.03      About 60% of the country's forest resources are located in 16 forest
conservancies north of a line running from Izmir to Kars which comprises the
project area. These forests contain some 9,000 forest villages and a rural
population of some 5 million people with a per capita income in 1976 of US$155
compared with a countrywide average of US$990.
C. Contribution of Forestry to the Economy
1.04      Recorded industrial roundwood production accounts for 3.2% of agri-
cultural GDP. However, such statistics do not bring out the importance of the



forests as a primary source of fuelwood in rural areas, accounting for over
95% of rural energy consumption and over 50% of total wood removals from the
forest. Nor do they indicate the critical importance of the forest areas in
protecting Turkey's watersheds, thereby preventing soil erosion and ensuring a
sustained flow of irrigation and drinking water for farmers and urban dwellers
situated downstream. The forest areas of Turkey also constitute a very
significant dry weather grazing reserve for villagers' livestock.
1.05      Forestry employment currently accounts for between 2% and 18% of
forest villagers' income (varying from region to region). Direct employment
in forestry operations is currently running at some 100,000 man-years per
annum. There are approximately 24,000 forestry based industries employing
about 60,000 persons with an estimated output of about TL 10.6 billion.
1.06      Historically and as a matter of policy, Turkey's forests have been
very conservatively managed and the forests are currently producing less than
half their potential sustained annual yield despite the facts that a high
proportion of the forest is over mature and that many of the country's sawmills
and other forest industries are operating at well below their potential
capacity because of shortage of log raw material. Although Turkey has major
reserves of unutilized wood, the country is a net importer of forest products
valued at about US$50 million in 1976. If access into the forest areas is not
improved and additional log production thereby increased, the country could
become a massive net importer of forest products by the mid-1980s. The
demand for roundwood by local industries is expected to exceed the equivalent
of US$750 million by 1985.
D. Future Production Potential and Constraints to Development
1.07      Total roundwood demand, including both fuelwood and industrial wood,
is projected to rise from the 1975 level of 17 million m3 to 24 million by
1985 and 41 million m3 by 1995. Industrial roundwood demand will rise from
6 million m3 in 1975 to 27 million m3 by 1995, i.e. about 65% of total round-
wood demand.
1.03      About 80% of Turkey's forest area has been surveyed and feasibility
studlies for inte,grated forestry and forest industry development have been
completed for two-thirds of the country's forest area. These studies indicate
that industrial roundwood output for Turkey as a whole could be increased from
the 1976 level of 6.6 million m3 to about 14 million m3 by 1985 and to some 20
million m3 by 19935. The key to expanded log production and increased rural
employment is thie introduction of an integrated forest management system,
including as its main elements the stabilization of the existing road system
in forest areas in order to lengthen the logging season and to provide addi-
tional rural empLoyment in the early spring and fall during periods when there
is no peak requirement for agricultural operations; construction of new roads
to open up approximately 50% of the total forest area of the country which
currently lacks a basic extraction and access road system; reforestation; and
more intensified management of cutover areas. Conversion of natural forest to
fast: growing industrial plantations could ensure future self-sufficiency in
industrial roundwood by the year 2000.



-3-
1.09      A constraint to rational exploitation and development of the forest
resources is the current land use conflict between agriculture and forestry;
the 8 million people residing in forest areas are partly dependent for their
livelihood on some 37 million head of livestock of which about one-third graze
extensively in the forest and in some areas destroy natural regeneration of
forest seedlings. Forest fires caused by forest villagers during ehe course
of clearing the land for planting of crops is another hazard. Annual net loss
of forest area due to these causes currently exceeds 10,000 ha. Historically,
forest villagers have well established grazing and cropping rights in the
immediate vicinity of forest villages and rights for collection of firewood
for domestic use. Both the problems of destruction of seedlings by livestock
and forest fires will be addressed by the proposed project (para 3.02).
1.10      One of the main current forest policy issues in Turkey is how to
achieve more effective integration between agriculture and forestry and to
improve forest villagers' income and quality of life. The Forest Village
Directorate of the Ministry of Forestry (ORKOY) is implementing a comprehen-
sive forest village development program which includes provision of supervised
credit for productive investments, e.g. projects for improved livestock, food,
poultry production and purchase of power saws, etc., as well as social infra-
structure investments, e.g. rural electrification, construction of clinics,
etc. Key issues in this area include need for gradual evolution away from sub-
sidized interest rates and for development of a sounder technical basis for
improved agriculture, particularly from improved animal husbandry and range
improvement, use of improved cultural practices, seeds and fertilizers and
strengthening of agricultural extension services at the forest village level.
This program is described in detail in the FAO-CP Preparation Report. In the
longer term, the forest village population is expected to decline from the
current level of 8 million to about 5 million by 1995, as a result of rural
urban migration. However, this is not expected to result in problems of
securing adequate labor for forestry operations except in some isolated
pockets. For the coming two decades, it is anticipated that labor intensive
technology will predominate, particularly in harvesting and reforestation
operations, and introduction of mechanization will be limited to areas where
labor intensive methods are not technically feasible, i.e. in areas of steeper
terrain and for some operations in areas near cities in the West. It is these
two activities, harvesting and reforestation, that offer the highest returns
to labor and the best shortrun potential for increasing rural employment in
the forest areas. ORKOY's village development program was reviewed by the
Bank during both project preparation and appraisal and judged to be an effec-
tive approach towards resolving the conflict between agriculture and forestry,
and to improving forest villagers' income. Government funding for this is
adequate to attain planned development targets.
E. Forestry Institutions
1.11      All types of forestry production and conservation programs are
integrated within a single Ministry of Forestry (MOF) which has four main
directorates concerned with Logging Production and Forest Management (OGM),



- 4 -
Afforestation and Erosion Control (AGM), Forest Village Affairs (ORKOY) and
National Parks and Environmental Protection (MPG). These institutions are
well organized and have an existing administrative network spread throughout
the forest areas; they have proven their ability to implement large-scale
forestry production and conservation programs, and their training programs
provide assurance of a steady supply of both professional and technical grade
foresters for future expansion. OGM, which would handle the production aspects
of the project, has doubled its industrial roundwood production over the last
seven years from about 3 million m3 to 6.6 million m3.
1.12      Also of relevance to the project are two other agencies, ORUS, the
General Directorate of Forest Industry of MOF which operates various saw-
mills and wood-based panel manufacturing plants and SEKA, the Government's
State Economic Enterprise (SEE) for pulp and paper manufacturing, which
operates under the Ministry of Industry.
1.13      The Government's countrywide forest development plan for the period
1976-82 gives high priority to: doubling of industrial roundwood output from
the 1976 countrywide level of 6.6 million m3 to 12 million m3; tripling of
reforestation and forest management targets with special emphasis on initiation
of a mechanized industrial plantation program in selected zones close to the
site of existing or planned forest industrial complexes; ORKOY's Forest
Village Improvement Program; protection of water catchment areas; and to
development of National Parks.
F. Forest Industries
1.14      The public sector agencies dominate the forestry industry in Turkey.
They are primarily responsible for protection and management of state owned
forest lands and for wood production. The state also controls about 80% of
paper production and about a third of sawn wood production. The private
sector is generally restricted to the sawmilling industry. The existing
forest industries in Turkey include over 5,000 small private sector sawmills
sitluated in the rural areas, mainly at the village level; about 25 large scale
sawnills, about one-third owned by the private sector and two-thirds by the
public sector (O]RUS), producing higher grade lumber manufactured for urban and
industrial consumption; and 32 pulp and paper mills, producing, in 1975,
381,500 tons of paper and paper board for the domestic market. One planned
pulp, paper and integrated forest industries complex (Karadeniz Project) is
scheduled for construction in the northern region and the Government has
approached the B,ank to assist in financing this SEKA project. The foreseeable
industrial roundwood demand of forest industries (see para 1.07) can absorb
all the anticipated increase in domestic roundwood production over the next
20 years and no major export trade in forest products is anticipated.

G. Previous Bank Involvement in the Sector
1.15      Previous Bank involvement in the sector has been in two projects:
the Akdeniz Forest Utilization Project, financed in 1974, which includes con-
struction of an integrated pulp, paper and sawmill complex under SEKA at
Silifke on the Mediterranean coast and intensification of forest management
in the surrounding forests by MOF; and, secondly, an integrated newsprint
plant and sawmill operation under SEKA, without a forestry component, located
at Balikesir in the Western Region of the proposed project area which was
financed in 1976. Disbursement for the industrial components of both projects
is behind schedule due mainly to construction delays.
1.16      Through the Akdeniz project, the Bank has financed technical assis-
tance designed to help MOF speed up its forest management planning methods,
and to introduce more dynamic forestry management systems, based on shorter
crop rotations and the use of fast growing species. Work in this area is
proceeding well and Turkish foresters have readily adapted themselves to more
modern technology. Pilot trials are also in progress for mechanizing logging
operations in areas of steeper terrain which are not suitable for labor inten-
sive extraction systems.
1.17      The project will extend the use of modern forestry extraction
methods into the 16 northern conservancies of Turkey. Project design is
based on a three-year FAO/UNDP study, which has prepared a long-term inte-
grated forestry and forest industries development program for the project
area, which aims to bring the forests into full production by 1995.
II. PROJECT AREA
A. Location and Forestry Production
2.01      The project area covers a total land area of 350,000 sq km (45% of
the land area of Turkey) of which 105,000 sq km are classified as forest land
(MAP IBRD 13330). It contains 16 of the country's 26 forest conservancies and
50,000 sq km of productive high forest currently producing less than half the
potential annual allowable cut. Industrial roundwood removals from the project
area have increased from 3.3 million m3 in 1970 to 4.8 million m3 in 1976, at
a rate of 6% p.a. (Table 5.1). It is planned to increase production to 10
million m3 by 1985. After 1995, when forest plantations established under the
project begin to produce, this production would increase further. Selection
of the project area, comprising the whole of the Northern Region rather than
part of it, was influenced by Government's objectives of introducing more
intensive extraction and reforestation operations into as large an area as
possible in the North Turkey forests during the next decade because the
forests throughout this region are overmature. Decay, declining yields and
fungal diseases are in some areas leading to deterioration of forests. About
3,500 sawmills in the project area are currently operating well below capacity
(in some cases at less than half) primarily because of shortage of roundwood.



Demand for industrial roundwood in the project area is increasing because of a
number of large Scale forest industrial enterprises under construction and in
the planning stages. If the project area was reduced, so would the roundwood
output.  This would probably force overcutting the more accessible forest
areas, which is technically unsound and undesirable and is already occurring
in certain parts of the western project area. The insistence on a smaller
project area in a Burma forestry project has resulted in overcutting with
resultant criticism. Moreover, the project area represents a natural forestry
region, in view of its climatic patterns and resulting intermixture of tree
species, and should be developed on an integrated basis. This approach to
forest management represents a major breakthrough towards improved forestry
practices, which the Bank first encouraged in the forests in the south of
Turlcey through the Akdeniz project.  In designing the project GOT took into
consideration economies of scale relating to road densities required for
economic wood exitraction, the urgent need to remove overmature timber and also
the fact that a smaller project would result in less employment, and smaller
import substitution impact.
B. Topography
2.02      The topography of the project area is extremely varied.  Zone 1,
the western part, consists of low elevation plains bordered by the Aegean,
Marmara and Blaclk Seas.  The second zone is a region lying adjacent to the
Black Sea coast and consisting of a narrow lowland plain backed by relatively
steep high mountains. The mountains generally lie within 50 km of the coast
and range in elevation from 1,500 m in the west to over 3,000 m in the east.
Characteristically, the drainage systems from these mountains are short
torrential streams. Two major rivers, the Kizilirmak and Yesilirmak, flow
through the project area into the Black Sea. Zone 3, the remaining part of
the project area south of the Black Sea coastal mountains and east of the
western lowland plains, is the high Central Anatolian Plateau varying in
elevation from 800 m at Eskisehir in the west to 1,700 m at Kars in the east.
The bulk of the productive forests are located in the first two zones.
C. Climate
2.03      The climate of the project area is influenced both by topography and
distance from the sea. The western part of the project area has a moderate
climate with annual rainfall of between 500 and 1,000 mm with a pronounced dry
sumner season.  Temperatures in this area are high and combined with low summer
rainfall, constiltute a high forest fire hazard. The climate along the central
Black Sea coastaL zone is characterized by moderate temperatures and well dis-
tributed high rainfall varying from 1,000 to 2,000 mm and increasing from west
to east with rising elevation. In the mountainous areas of these regions at
elevations in excess of 1,000 m, snow occurs for from three to six months in
the winter and limits forestry extraction activities at higher elevations to a
total of three or four months between May and October. The Anatolian plateau
is a much drier region receiving only 300 mm to 600 mm rainfall with severe
winters and a relatively short growing season.



D. Geology and Soils
2.04      The geology and soils of the project area vary considerably.  The
eastern and central zones are characterized by large areas of mesozoic creta-
ceous deposits. Two main soil types occur, red podzols in the coastal zones
and brown forest soils and podzolized soils further inland. The western zone
consists primarily of soils of calcareous origin. Sedimentary deposits,
schists, shales, gneiss and marl occur throughout the project area and are
particularly susceptible to soil erosion.
E. Infrastructure
2.05      The infrastructure of the western part of the project area is
highly developed and includes two of Turkey's largest cities, Istanbul and
Izmir. Save for the provincial capitals of Bolu, Zonguldak and Kastamonu,
and a narrow coastal belt along the Black Sea, which has one of the highest
population densities in Turkey, the central zone is relatively undeveloped.
The inland part of the eastern zone is sparsely settled and development is
limited to the cities of Erzurum and Kars.
2.06      The project area is served by a network of 17,000 km of national
highways and 11,000 km of provincial secondary roads, mostly gravel surfaced,
plus a network of forest and village access roads which in 1977 was 42,000 km
out of a planned 80,000 km ultimately.
F. Economy
2.07      The economy of the project area is based mainly on agriculture and
to a lesser extent forestry. Food and industrial crops provide the greatest
proportion of income and employment; only 13% of total annual agricultural
production comes from livestock products. Average livestock density is 100
animals per square kilometer. In 1975, the total value of industrial round-
wood extracted from the project area (about 4.7 million m3) was estimated to
be about US$75 million (60%), using border prices, compared to the total pro-
duction of the country of US$125 million. Wood products and paper produced
in the project area comprise about 5% of the project area's total production
of manufactured products. Forestry employment is currently also of importance
to some 5,000 forest villages in the project area.
III. THE PROJECT
A. Objectives
3.01      The project objectives are to increase roundwood production in the
currently underutilized forests of North Turkey; to improve forest management



- 8 -
planning on some 5 million ha of these forests; to create additional employ-
ment for forest villagers; to provide additional raw material to some 3,500
mainly small private sector village sawmills and to about 25 major forest
industries located in the region, many of which are now operating at less than
hallf their capacity because of roundwood shortage; and for several new large
scale SEKA and ORUS industries currently in the planning stage, including a
SEKA pulpmill complex for which the Government is seeking Bank financial sup-
port; and help meet demand elsewhere in Turkey. The project is intended to
save forest product imports and strengthen an ongoing Government program for
development of forest villages. The project will comprise a seven-year time
slice from 1979 to 1985 of a long-term development program for the area, which
ccivers the period 1975-95 and which was prepared by a joint Government-FAO/
UNDP team over the last three years and which program has been fully accepted
byr Government. Project design is based primarily on this work. A seven-year
period was selected by both the Government and the Bank as the minimum period
required to evaluate results of the proposed reforestation program, bearing in
mind that it takes at least two years to develop forest nurseries and develop
laind for planting. It is impossible to adequately evaluate industrial planta-
tion survival rates and potential yields in less than five years following
planting. A shorter time slice would consequently be technically unsound.
B. Project Works
3.02      The project will finance:  (a) the construction of about 26,000 km
of forest roads, village access and logging extraction roads; (b) stabiliza-
tion of 25,000 km of existing and newly constructed roads; (c) seven new
mechanical workshops for equipment maintenance; (d) an intensified forest
management program including reforestation; (e) planting of currently non-
productive lands with fast growing tree species; (f) erosion control works in
fcrest which form part of critical water catchment areas; (g) range improve-
ment in potential grazing areas with special emphasis on pasture improvement
and the initiation of pilot rotational grazing schemes at the village level;
(h) construction of new forest nurseries for seedling production; Ci) equip-
ment needed for intensification of forestry research and revision of current
management plans; (j) logging equipment needed for extraction of logs from
steep inaccessible areas which cannot be harvested by manual methods (compris-
ing about 10 to 15% of the project area); (k) technical assistance and train-
ing of forest villagers in both forestry and log extraction techniques; (1)
on-the-job training of machinery and equipment operators; (m) forest protection
and conservation works including fire towers; (n) fencing of regeneration areas
to prevent browsing by livestock; and (o) pilot wild life and environmental
protection prog;rams in forest areas and National Parks. Annual targets of
project implementation and the responsibilities of each agency are shown in
Table 3.1 and the estimated schedule of expenditure is in Annex 2 (Table 3).

3.03      The actions being financed under the project include special emphasis
on the introduction of technology which will extend the currently short logging
season through the provision of all-weather roads, logging equipment to permit
extraction from inaccessible areas, intensified forest management and refore-
station.  The extension of the logging season would ease the current conflict
between labor requirements for agriculture and forestry operations during the
peak planting and harvesting seasons, thus making it possible for forest
villagers to increase the proportion of their annual income deriving from
forest work (para 7.06).  It will extend log harvesting into inaccessible
areas by, for example, use of skyline logging systems commonly used for
ext:raction operations in similar country in the Pacific Northwest region of
the U.S.A.; intensify forest management with special reference to establish-
merit of fast growing industrial plantations with selected indigenous and
exotic species which, with a 20-year cycle, have the potential to produce up
to ten times more industrial wood per hectare than slower growing natural
forests, introduce erosion control measures in steep catchment areas, including
wider application of the "gradoni" terracing technique 1/; introduce a moni-
toring system for checking sediment load in streams flowing from forest areas
and determining the effects of activities of upstream logging operations and
graziers; introduce new forest management planning methods based on shorter
cropping rotations; and concentration of forestry and extraction operations in
ordler to reduce log production costs. Many of the innovatory techniques,
including establishment of industrial plantations being adopted in the project,
are the culminaltion of over a decade of continuous research and development
carried out by ithe Government's Forestry Directorates in conjunction with
te,hnical assisitance experts financed through FAO/UNDP and other aid programs.
3.04      Project actions directly related to forest village improvements
(construction of village access roads and range management improvements) are
parts of a major ongoing program of forest village improvement being imple-
mented by the slpecially created Forestry Directorate, ORKOY. ORKOY's program
has been described in para 1.10.
C. Cost Estimates
3.05      Total project costs over seven years (Table 3.2 and Annex 2, Table 1),
including physical contingencies and price increases, are estimated at TL 17.6
billion ("S$915 million). Direct foreign exchange costs are TL 1.8 billion
(U5$92.5 million) or 10% of total project cost.  Indirect foreign exchange
costs, including reserve procurement by the Ministry of Forestry, are estimated
at TL 4.4 billion (US$230.5 million) or 25% of total project cost. Civil
works estimates were prepared by the MOF and the FAO-CP preparation team and
ares based on acitual costs of similar works being undertaken by MOF. Esti-
mates for foreign equipment are based on quotations and on bid prices obtained
for similar equipment recently purchased for the Akdeniz Forest Utilization

or both, depending on the site.

project. They are net of taxes and duties from which MOF are exempted. Con-
sultants costs have been estimated at US$67,000 per man-year. Base costs are
at September 1977 levels. Contingencies amount to 73% of base cost, mostly
accounted for by local price increases. Physical contingency allowances are
5% and price contingency estimates assume increases in international prices of
7.5% for 1977-79 and 7% for 1980-85, and in local currency project costs of
25% for 1977, 20% for 1978, and 15% for 1979 and 10% for 1980-85. These
latter are based on expected general price increases of 35% for 1977, 25% for
1978, 20% for 1979, 16% for 1980, 12% for 1981-85. They were adjusted for
lagged and lower rates of increases expected for major cost items including
government salaries; the latter, which comprise about 35% of local costs, are
not expected to keep pace with the latest forecasted rate of inflation.

D. Financing
3.06      The Bank loan of US$86 million would finance US$85 million of
equipment and machinery, including scientific equipment for the Forestry
PLanning and Project Monitoring Unit (FPMU) and US$1 million for technical
services and training (para. 4.06). The loan would finance 93% of direct
foreign exchange requirements or 9% of total project costs. Suppliers credits
have been obtained from Brazil for the remainder of direct foreign exchange
costs totalling US$6.5 million. Local currency requirements of US$822.5
miLllion (90% of total project costs) which include indirect foreign exchange
costs (US$230.5 million), items which are manufactured in Turkey and reserved
for local procurement by MOF will be financed by OGM which, as a revenue
generating agency, enjoys almost full financial autonomy. The MOF has three
main budgets of which the "Revolving Budget" (or Fund), which totalled TL 6.4
billion in 1977, is the largest. This covers all expenditures related to
production and sales and is entirely financed by the sales and other revenues
of the MOF. It does not need Parliamentary approval except for the investment
expenditures as part of the total Ministry investment program. The second
budget, the "Arnex Budget", which amounted to TL 1.5 billion in 1977, primarily
covers forestry activities which are national in nature or are not directly
related to production, e.g. research. This is financed almost entirely by the
Revolving Fund by transfer of the stumpage fee but must be approved by the
Parliament.  The third budget, the Ministry Budget, is financed by a national
budgetary allocation, which was TL 0.9 billion in 1977, and covers most of the
national overhead expenditures, e.g. salaries. Full details of the budgeting
mechanisms of the MOF are given in the appraisal report of the Akdeniz Forest
Utilization project (Report No. 240a-TU, Volume 2, Annex 3). All operating
and investment costs would be fully covered by the sales revenue (see para.
6.01). OGM also has substantial accumulated equity, which amounted to TL 3.7
billion in 1976, and will operate on an entirely cash budget. During nego-
tiations, agreement was reached that the present system of financing of the
MOF will not be altered without prior consultation with the Bank during the
lfe of the project.
E. Procurement
3.07      Under the proposed Bank loan, the Ministry of Forestry would procure
equipment and machinery, totalling about US$86.0 million including contin-
gencies to be purchased under the project.  Items will be bulked and tendered
subject to international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank
GroUP'S "Guidelines for Procurement," save for small items estimated to cost
le'ss than US$50,000 up to a limit of US$500,000 total. For these items quota-
tions will be obtained from three suppliers. Lists of this equipment are
shown in Annex 2, (Table 2). It was agreed that import licenses will be
issued promptly to all successful bidders for equipment contracts put to
irLternational competitive bidding. Goods manufactured in Turkey may be
granted a margin of preference in accordance with Bank procedures. In the



- 13-
event that equipment and/or machinery proposed to be purchased under interna-
tional competitive bidding and to be financed under the Bank loan is reserved
by the Government for local procurement, an equivalent amount of the loan
would be cancelled.
3.08      The MOF has reserved procurement of certain types of vehicles and
equipment, assembled and/or manufactured in Turkey and which they customarily
purchase on the local market (Annex 2, Table 2), costing some TL 1,058 million
(US$155 million) excluding contingencies. This equipment will be purchased
locally and paid for from the "Revolving Budget" of the MOF (para. 3.06).  MOF
has had no difficulty in the Dast in obtaining their equipment requirements
because of the size of their orders and the liquidity of the "Revolving Bud-
get" and do not anticipate any.  Moreover, such reserved procurement would
facilitate standardization of certain types of vehicles and equipment.  Agree-
ment was obtained during negotiations that all vehicles and equipment reserved
by MOF for local procurement and listed in Annex 2, Table 2 would be purchased
in accordance with the annual schedule in said Table 2.
F. Disbursement
3.09      The Bank loan will be disbursed against 100% of the foreign
exchange expenditures on imported machinery and equipment, foreign consul-
tants and training abroad of staff, and 100% of the ex-factory cost of
locally manufactured equipment if awarded after international competitive
bidding. The estimated schedule of disbursement is over seven years as
shown in Table 3.3.

District (Isletme)
Sub-district (Bolge)
Four Directorates within the Ministry of Forestry will be concerned with
development of project infrastructure and production and one Directorate,
ORUS, as well as one State Economic Enterprise (SEKA) will be concerned with
utilization of forest production. Seventy percent of the project roundwood
extraction and transportation operations will be carried out by forest vil-
lagers using their own chain saws, hand tools and trucks. All of these items
are locally manufactured and adequate forestry credit schemes already exist
through ORKOY for their purchase.
OGM - The General Directorate of Logging Production and Forest
Manage%ent is responsible for forest management, production
sales and infrastructure operations. It has 16 Conservancy, 116



- 16 -
Divisional, 728 District Forest Offices, and 9 Workshops already
located in the project area, with a total of 1,245 professional
and 390 technical staff. Each Divisional Office is a self-
accounting, unit; overall financial control and auditing are
centralized in OGM Headquarters in Ankara. OGM will implement
the project road construction except for those village access
roads constructed by ORKOY and log extraction programs and those
reforestation operations relating to regeneration of natural forest
in logged over areas.
AGM - The General Directorate of Afforestation and Erosion Contol
implements all other reforestation, afforestation, and erosion
control forestry activities, and also undertakes range improvement
activity in and around forest villages. In the project area, it has
10 District Offices, one forest research institute with various
substations, a Tree Seed Improvement institute, and a Soils Research
Station. There are some 240 professional and 320 technical grade
staff. AGM will implement the project forestry works related to
establishment of industrial plantations, afforestation of degraded
forest, erosion control, forest maintenance, protection and range
improvement.
ORKOY - The General Directorate of Forest Village Affairs handles all
aspects of development in those villages situated actually within the
forest boundaries. It has 12 offices in the project area and 55
professional staff. It will be responsible for planning of the
project village road component, for the construction of certain
village access roads and planning of the range improvement works and
will be consulted on all matters relating to the project's involve-
ment of forest villagers in forestry and extraction operations.
MPG - The General Directorate of National Parks and Environmental
Protection will implement environmental protection and wild-
life breeding programs in the project area. The project includes
provision for external consultant assistance for the formulation
of more inclusive environmental, conservation and protection
programs for the project area, which Government is willing in
principle to fund from its own resources.
ORUS - The Forest Industries General Directorate of MOF will provide
a major market for project output and a representative of ORUS will be
periodically co-opted to the project monitoring team in order to ensure
effective i-orward planning of wood production targets and integration
with the raw material requirements of ORUS Forest Industrial Enterprises.
In addition to the above, close liaison will be maintained with SEKA, the Gov-
ernment's pulp and paper SEE concerning the pulpwood requirements of SEKA's
existing and planned pulp and paper mills.  During negotiations, agreement
was reached that the Forestry Monitoring Unit (FPMU) would consult annually
ORUS and SEKA as to their wood requirements for the coming year when preparing
annual work programs.

B. Forestry Planning and Project Monitoring Unit (FPMU)
4.02      Achieving effective coordination and improved forest management plan-
ning have been constraints to efficient forest management in the past. The
problem is essentially that of ensuring integrated forward planning of field
operations by the several Directorates in order, for example, to coordinate
the reforestation operations more closely with extraction; and to optimize the
road network needed for forest exploitation and protection. Accordingly, under
the project, the MOF's Planning Unit, presently staffed with six professionals,
two of which are permanent and four of which are seconded to the Unit from
operational directorates, reporting as it does directly to the Undersecretary
of MOF and which has been continuously involved in project design and formula-
tion, will be expanded to form a Forestry Planning and Project Monitoring Unit
(FPMU). In order to undertake this increased work program, it was agreed
FPMU's current staff and budget resources will be strengthened to at least 12
forestry professionals by December 31, 1978. FPMU will coordinate all project
activities in conjunction with the four Directorates implementing project
components. It will consolidate the annual district work programs for each of
the 16 forest conservancies (as delineated by OGM in consultation with AGM,
ORKOY and MPG) to reflect: (a) the long-range forest management plans for
each district of a conservancy as they are prepared by the proposed management
planning teams (para 4.06); and (b) the annual district and sub-district work
programs for each conservancy of QGM, AGM, ORKOY and MPG. Agreement was
obtained during negotiations that these 16 annual conservancy work programs
will be prepared and submitted to the Bank for review and comment prior to
August 15 of the year preceding the year of implementation.
4.03      FPMU will have a total of 12 full time forest professionals drawn
from:
BPD 1/                  2
OGM                     6
AGM                     2
ORKOY                   1
MPG                     1
12
Agreement was obtained that FPMU will be provided with at least five vehicles
to ensure the mobility of its staff not later than September 30, 1979.
4.04      Of critical importance to the project's success will be revision of
the current working plans for the forests in the 16 conservancies through which
will be introduced proposals for more intensive forestry management incorporat-
ing shorter rotations and reforestation with fast growing species.
1/   The existing Planning Department of the MOF.

4.05      As part of the Bank financed Akdeniz Project, consultant services
were provided to MOF to assist in preparing sample management plans for two
forest regions in the south and for training of Turkish forestry personnel in
improved management planning methods. The project will build on this experi-
ence. It is proposed to complete revision of management plans for 5 million
ha of the projeczt area forest by 1985, i.e. all the project area's high
productive forest. In order to achieve this target and thereby improve the
martagement of the most productive forest and optimize exploitation, MOF esti-
mates that it will be necessary to have at work at least 30 management planning
teams, responsible to OGM, comprising at least three forestry professionals,
by not later than September 30, 1980. Agreement to this effect was obtained
during negotiations. Project costs include US$0.25 million for the purchase
of specialized equipment FPMU requires for photo-interpretation and computer
work. For monitoring of project progress, FPMU working in conjunction with
OGM, AGM, ORKOY and MPG field staff, will assess physical progress, prepare
quarterly reports for submission to the Bank on project progress, identify
project bottlenecks and ensure such consultation with the Directorates as may
be necessary for resolving such bottlenecks. It was agreed that these reports
wiLl be submitted.
C. Consultancy Services, Technical Assistance and Training
4.0)6     The project includes provision for the foreign exchange cost for 144
man-months of training fellowships for Turkish personnel overseas in various
aspects of forestry management and extraction at a cost of about US$150,000
ancl 12 man-years of expatriate technical consultancy assistance costing about
US$i800,000 (US$67,000/man-year). This would include three man-years for
management planning, one man-year for extraction techniques, one man-year for
administration of workshops, one man-year for mechanized plantations, one
marl-year for reforestation and afforestation site evaluation, one man-year for
wildlife conservation and national park development, and four man-years for
shcort-term consuiltants in various specialities. Draft terms of reference are
available (Annex 3, C5) and were agreed upon during negotiations. Agreement
was reached during negotiations that consultants will be employed before
December 31, 1978 according to the specialties required and under terms and
conditions acceptable to the Borrower and the Bank.
4.C7      The total cost of the project's technical assistance and training
component is estimated at some US$950,000 - all of which is foreign exchange.

/1   MOF's estimate of production.
Industrial roundwood production has historically grown at 6% and it is planned
that this growth rate be maintained (para 2.01). The project would remove the
main constraint to achieving this growth rate since it would provide equipment
to construct logging roads in unexploited areas. Presently accessible areas
would have been fully exploited by 1981 and any further extraction would lead
to over-cutting. The proposed 6% annual increase in forest production is
based on projected cutting plans assuming forest access road construction at
the levels proposed under the project and is considered attainable in view of
the MOF's performance over the 1970-76 period.
5.02      Of the sustained annual yield of 10 million m3 of industrial round-
wood, about 65% is of coniferous species and about 35% deciduous, the most
important category being coniferous sawlogs which make up 38% of total output.
The annual value of output at full development would be TL 11.4 billion
(US$594 million) in financial prices and TL 11.3 billion (US$588 million) in
economic prices. Details of project output are shown in Table 5.2.

B. Markets and Prices
5.03      The project output is expected to be entirely domestically consumed.
About 69% will supply local industries already in existence or under construc-
tion, including the Balikesir integrated mill; about 13% will be required by
SEKA and ORUS for the Karadeniz pulp and paper mill with its associated saw-
mills for which the Government is seeking Bank financing assistance; and the
remainder will be used by new private enterprises. These enterprises would
benefit from the government's incentive schemes to encourage industries to
locate in less developed regions. About 40 applicants for mills, who have
completed feasibility studies, have already been given preliminary approval
by the government. The project area is expected to contribute about 70% of
the roundwood needed to meet national demand, which is summarized below.

of the two previous Bank-financed projects. 2/
5.05      The Republic of Turkey owns the forests in the project area.
Basically Ministry of Forestry's pricing policy aims to cover costs (i.e.
stumpage plus extraction and overhead costs). Forty percent of project output
wiLl be sold by open auction and as in the past, minimum reserve prices will
be calculated which will adequately cover these costs. For the other 60% to
be sold to priority users, i.e. SEKA, ORUS, other Government Departments and
Forest Villagers, selling prices for wood are fixed, also based on the prin-
ciple of covering costs. Price fixing formulae established by MOF are satis-
factory. The open market (auction) prices were in line with world market
levels until 1976 when they rose significantly; up to 40% above international
prices for some items. This discrepancy is largely due to the restriction on
roundwood imports. During project appraisal, it was not considered appropriate
to try to persuade GOT to liberalize trade of roundwood in the present context
of extreme balance of payments difficulties faced by Turkey. The economic
analysis was based on international prices. The financial analysis was based
on weighted average domestic prices to reflect expected revenues of the
Miniistry of Forestry (Table 5.4). It was agreed that if this system is
altered during the life of the project the Bank will be promptly notified and
the borrower will allocate funds necessary for adequate project financing.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
6.01       The project is a continuation and extension of the MOF's ongoing
forest exploitation program.  This program has historically generated an
operating surplus and OGM has substantial stocks and liquid reserves which
amounted to TL 2.7 billion in 1976. DGM will continue to generate a surplus
during the project as shown in Table 6.1.

With a positive cash flow throughout project investment period, MOF can fi-
nance the project investments on a cash basis, following their normal practice
and OGM will not require incremental working capital to implement the expan-
sion. The financial rate of return, based on incremental output attributable
to investments, is 70%. The rate of return calculation including details
of all costs is shown in Annex 2, Table 7.
VII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS
A. Benefits
7.01      The project will contribute to meeting national objectives of
raising output through efficient utilization of natural resources, protect-
ing the environment, industrial development coupled with import substitution
and improving incomes and living standards of the rural poor.
Forest Management and Production
7.02       In addition to providing roads infrastructure for extraction of in-
dustrial wood at a sustained level of 10 million m3 ub, the project would help
to ensure the adoption of modern forest management methods. These include



- 25 -
the use of shorter rotations, establishment of industrial plantations using
fast growing species of greater productivity than the natural forest, and the
introduction of mechanized cable logging systems in about 15% of the project
area which is inaccessible by road. Thus, the project would prepare the ground
for further intensification of forest management and production beyond 10 mil-
lion m3.
Environmental Impact
7.03      The project would also help combat problems of erosion in the project
area. In particular, the project's range improvement, erosion control and
forest protection components, which constitute 15% of total project costs,
would have major effects on protecting Northern Turkey's watersheds. Range
improvement works would provide alternative grazing for forest villages and
reduce the adverse impact of grazing on tree regeneration and erosion. A
consultant environmental scientist, who was included in the project prepara-
tion team (see FAO-CP Preparation Report, Annex 9), investigated the possible
adverse impact of the forest industrial development which would follow imple-
mentation of the proposed project (particularly the proposed Karadeniz pulp
mill). Government has been alerted to this issue and the government's
Environmental Committee will be consulted during preparation of the feasibility
studies of the Karadeniz pulp mill project. The environmental consultant also
made recommendations for expansion of the wildlife conservation programs in
the project area and for preservation of nature reserves which would retain
part of the ecosystem intact, preserve gene pools and provide a control area
for assessment of the ecological impact of land use changes. Consultant
services would be provided by the project to help develop these recommendations
for implementation (para 4.07).
Forest Industries Imports
7.04      By substituting for imports of roundwood and manufactured forest
products, the project would save over US$500 million equivalent in foreign
exchange per annum at full development. The project will also contribute
to developing industries in which Turkey has a natural competitive advantage.
The project is part of an integrated effort to develop forest resources,
rationalize existing industries and to develop new capacity, which were all
studied under the UNDP-FAO projects. Recommendations for existing industries
are beginning to be implemented and investments for new capacity are under
preparation.
B. Beneficiaries
7.05      The benefits of the project, which amount to over TL 4 billion at
full development, would accrue to the government. This would include a net
contribution to the national Treasury of about TL 2.3 billion per annum.



- 26 -
7.06      Although the project has not been specifically designed to improve
rural incomes, the project addresses the most important problems of the forest
villagers. First, it makes forestry a more secure source of regular employ-
ment. Secondly, it ensures additional funds for ORKOY's Village Development
Program. Thirdly, it helps develop forest pasture, the only available resource
for viable develpoment other than the forest in many villages. Finally, it
breaks isolation from markets and employment by the provision of village roads.
At present, the log harvesting season is limited by the lack of all-weather
roads to the dry summer season lasting between 80 and 160 days. This would
be extended undier the project to between 175 and 225 days and would provide
employment during otherwise slack seasons, and would not only reduce under-
employment but would also make life in forest villages more secure and viable.
Direct employment in forestry operations would nearly double, from 18.6 million
to 32.8 million man days per annum, providing 165,000 new jobs with an average
annual wage of TL 3,800 in additional income. Project works, mainly road
construction, would require another 94 million man days over 7 years.  The 3%
village development tax levied on all OGM sales, and the project itself, would
support ORKOY's forest village program. In one way or another, the project
would improve the lives of almost all the five million inhabitants of the
prDject forests. These people are among the poorest group of the population.
Statistics are Jscanty but indicate per capita incomes ranging from TL 1,000
(US$62) 1/ to TL 5,000 (US$311) in 1976 compared to the national average of
TL 15,800 (US$9'90) and the poverty level of TL 3,500 (US$218).
C. Economic Rate of Return
7.07      The project as designed was compared with three alternatives.  First
it was assumed that in the absence of the project MOF would not undertake sig-
nificant alternative investments. In this case all forestry operations would
cease by 1982, since their existing equipment has been planned to be scrapped
by that date. On this assumption, the project's rate of return would be 76%.
It is possible, however, that some of the equipment will still be usable for
some years beyond 1982 but is is difficult to make judgments on this with any
degree of precision. Another possibility is that it would be possible to
phase down production more gradually as follows: from the planned level of
7 million m3 in 1979 to 50% in 1982 (3.5 million m3), to 25% in 1985 (1.75 mil-
lion m3), to 10%, in 1987 (0.7 million m3), and to zero in 1998. This phased
reduction in output would involve some road building costs (although the forest
would be over cujt which is contrary to the principles of sound forest manage-
ment), but neither new machinery nor any other investments would be made.  In
this second case the rate of return would be about 50%.
7.08      This suggests that the rate of return should be between 49 and 76%,
the latter is regarded as the basic rate of return in view of the uncertainty
concerning the useability of the equipment beyond their normal lives and since
1/   US$1 = TL '16.053, 1976 exchange rate.

road construction and other investments required to achieve the level of pro-
duction, assumed under the without project alternative, have not been estimated
in detail. In any event, these rates of returns do not take into account the
full benefits of industrial plantations, protection against fire, disease and
illegal exploitation which would eventually increase the annual allowable cut
beyond 10 million m3, nor the benefits which are difficult to quantify, which
include the effects of land conservation and improvement works, national parks,
village roads, range improvements and other village development efforts.
7.09      A third alternative would be to continue the level of current pro-
duction (5 million m3) indefinitely by undertaking additional investments in
road building and forestry operations, while maintaining the forest stock.
In the absence of a detailed feasibility study for this alternative, the incre-
mental investment cost in this case was assumed to be about half the project
costs. This is a conservative assumption since there are economies of scale
relating to road densities required for economic wood extraction. A smaller
project would also make less of an impact on the problem of removing over-
mature trees. The project's rate of return as compared to this alternative
would be virtually the same as for the first alternative (72%), indicating
that the maintenance of the current level of production, while avoiding
overcutting, is a marginal proposition. These assumptions have been recorded
and discussed (Annex 3, C10).
7.10      The estimated return may appear unusually high but is to be expected
because the project has large sunk costs. Not only has much of the infrastruc-
ture been developed in the form of major roads, depots, administrative buildings,
and know-how, but the standing forest can be immediately exploited under sound
management without depleting the national stock. The project investment costs
are low relative to operating costs but clearly remove bottlenecks which hitherto
prevented systematic exploitation of valuable natural resources.
7.11      Quantified benefits include industrial roundwood output which was
valued as traded goods and fuelwood which was valued at its open market price
(para 5.05). Information obtained in the field and from OGM and ORKOY staff
indicate that during the off-season unskilled labor has few employment
opportunities. Off-season labor was valued at TL 40 to reflect the wage (net
of moving costs to town) at which the villagers would be prepared to work in
the town. This compares with TL 120, the peak season rural wage. Fuel was
valued at its border price and major transfers were deducted from costs. An
opportunity cost for land was introduced for areas which have marginal use for
agriculture as indicated in land use capability studies, and for areas which
are closed to grazing during regeneration. Domestic prices of non-traded goods
and labor were adjusted by the standard conversion factor, 0.82, to translate
them into border prices. 1/ Physical contingencies of 5% are included in all
investment and recurrent costs. Details are shown in Annex 2, Tables 8, 9 and
10.
7.12      Tests of the rate of return's sensitivity to major assumptions show
the following results.
1/   This is equivalent to the use of a shadow exchange rate of TL 23.5 per
US$1.0 rather than the official rate of TL 19.25.

Table 7.1: Sensitivity Analysis
Economic Rate
of Return
(a) Reduction in roundwood prices or in incremental
production by 20%:                                             43
(b)  Project implementation slowed down by four years:                 70
(c)  Increase in all investment and operating costs by 20%:           49
(d)  Increase in road construction costs by 20%:                       70
(e)  Unskilled labor valued at peak market wage:                       60
(f) Processing capacity in addition to those existing
and under construction not installed and surplus
output exported to Europe:                                     64
VIII. PROJECT RISKS
8.01      Risks of the project proving uneconomic due to adverse conditions are
low. The main element of risk is that if the road construction targets were not
achieved for some unforeseen circumstances, then it would be necessary to over
cut the accessible forest to maintain industrial production at planned levels
to meet demand. However, MOF has shown itself to be capable of implementing
large scale forestry extraction and management programs; and even if implemen-
tation were slowed down by four years, the rate of return would still be 70%.
It is possible that construction of processing capacity might be delayed or
that domestic demand does not increase at the rates expected. However, the
surplus could easily be exported to Europe whose import needs have been pre-
dicted to increase and where Turkey would have a major advantage of geographic
proximity. In this case, the rate of return would still be 64%. Local price
inflation would not be expected to jeopardize project financing because of the
project's positive cash flow and since revenues from industrial roundwood, an
important construction material, are likely to increase in line with inflation.
Devaluation of the lira would not pose any financing problems since the direct
foreign exchange costs represent a small portion of total operating costs.
While the sensitivity tests show a large decline in the rate of return if
international prices of roundwood were to fall, this is a function of very
high rates of return and does not pose a special risk. Moreover, world market
prices are expected to increase in real terms.
IX. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
9.Cl      Agreements having been reached on the principal issues referred to
in Chapters 3, 4 and 5, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$86 mil-
lion to the Government of Turkey for a term of 17 years with a 4-year grace
period at an interest rate of 7.5% per annum.
