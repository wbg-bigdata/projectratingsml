APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        The Indonesian transport system comprises marine services which
linl, the islands, and highways and railways which provide the inlarnd
transport facilities. Land transport is well developed in Java with an
extensive railway and highway network, w-hile in Sumatra railways have been
developed only in some parts and the road network is limited to basic links
between principal cities.  Air transport is still limited but is increasing
rapidly. Most transport facilities have been neglected and require rehabili-
tation and modernizing.
ii.       This report appraises a project for the rehabilitation of the
Indonesian State Railways (Perusahaan Jawatan Kereta Api - PJKA), with the
objective of enabling the railways to reestablish and maintain both their
proper economic role in the transport sector and their financial viability.
The proposed loan of US$48 million equivalent in support of the Project
would be the first Bank Group assistance to Indonesia for railway purposes.
iii.      The Indonesian State Railways is the largest railway system in
Southeast Asia. In 1972 the railways carried 4.6 million tons of freight
traffic and about 40 million passengers; they play an important role in
the economy of the country. The management of the railway is under the
Ministry of Communications and it is operated as an agency of the Government.
Until 1971 it was a statutory corporation, but for many years revenues had
been barely sufficient to meet working costs excluding depreciation. In
consequence, maintenance, repair and renewals were neglected and quality of
service suffered. Where modern equipment is available the railways are able
to offer good service at low cost. In the main, however, operations are
still hampered and costs are inflated by outmoded and ancient equipment, poor
track and inadequate standards of repair and maintenance.
iv.       The five-vear Railway Investment Plan prepared by PJKA, and
accepted by the Government and the Bank,wil] be incorporated in the Govern-
ment's Second Five Year Plan (1974-1979). The objective of the PJKA Plan
is rehabilitation of the railways and improvement of operating and mainten-
ance standards through training and technical assistance. The total
estimated cost is Rp 103 billion (US$248 million equivalent). Implementation
of the Plan will assure a substantial improvement in the quality of rail
service, some increased capacity consonant with the traffic forecasts,
lower operating unit costs and ultimate elimination of operating deficits.
v.        The Project comprises the first three years of the Plan, from
1974/75 to 1976/77, and is estimated to cost US$158 million equivalent,
of which US$98 million equivalent is in foreign exchange. Included in



- ii -
the Project are the renewal and rehabilitation of track, signalling, tele-
communications, locomotives and rolling stock, the equipment of workshops
and depots with modern machinery, the building-up of inventories, and exten-
sive training and technical assistance to optimize the benefits from the
nroposed investment. Also included in the Project is a comprehensive
recovery plan designed to help PJKA break even financially by no later
than fiscal year 1979/80. The proposed loan will finance that part of the
foreign exchange component of the Project not covered by Government
rcsc-urces and bilateral loans. It will finance track material and plant,
signalling, telecommunications, diesel locomotives, passenger and freight
cars, machine tools, spares and components, and technical assistance and
training.  Procurement will be through international competitive bidding in
accordance with the Bank's guidelines except for components and spares for
existing euipDment, estimated to cost TJS$6.5 million or about 14% of the
proposed loan.
vi.       The overall rate of economic return on the total investment is
estimate<l at over 20,'.  The financial benefits will also be substantial.
A realistic estimate of the cost reductions which the rehabilitation program
wil] induce indicates that by 1979/80, the railways should be able to
reestablish their viability. While tlhe financial rate of return on the
incremental investment will be substantial, the overall rate of return,
based on the present day depreciated value of all railway fixed assets, will
probably be little more than 1% in 1979/80.  Even so small a return in the
short span of five years represents a satisfactory reversal of the trend
tow,ards rising costs and increasing deficits caused by almost three decades
of neglect and increasing inadequacy of service. The economic and costing
studies have established that there is a sound economic role for the rail-
ways to play in Indonesia. The Plan and Project represent the minimum
investment needed to assure that they do so.
vii.      In view of the dilapidated state of the railways' assets and the
inability of PJKA to service debt for the next several years, the Government
h is agreed that the proceeds of the loan and bilateral loans, if any, needed
to finance the Project should he passed on to PJKA in the form of equity.
In 1979/S0 PJKA should again be viable. The Government can then consider
the reconversion of PJKA to a statutory corporation, and the extent to which
P,TKA should assume liability for debt service.
viii.     The Project will be suitable for a Bank loan of US$48 million
equivalent to the Government of Indonesia for a period of 20 years, including
five years of grace.

APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of !tndonesia has asked the Bank to help finance
rehabilitation of the main lne railway systems of Java and North and
South Sumatra. These lines constitute about 55% of the 6,800 km Indonesian
railway system. The Project would consist of the investments covered by
the first three years of the 1974-79 railway development plan - part of the
Government's Second Five-Year Plan.
1.02      The total cost of the Project is estimated to be Rp 65 billion
(US$158 million) and the foreign exchange content US$98 million. The loan
would provide US$48 million, and bilateral commitments or the Government's
own reserves are expected to cover the balance of the foreign exchange needs
of the Project.
1.03      At the request of the Government, the Federal Republic of Germany
financed a technical aid project (1969-71) for management and planning
assistance to the Indonesian Railways and conmissioned Deutsche Eisenbhan
Consulting GMBH (DECONSULT) to undertake the work. DECONSULT's final
report, completed in September 1972, included the identification of
investments required for the rehabilitation and modernization of the rail-
ways. These proposals formed a basis for extensive discussions with PJKA
and the Government on the formulation of a railway project suitable for a
Bank loan. The present Project is the result of these discussions and
extensive field inspections by the Bank.
1.04      This will be the first Indonesian Railway Project.  Three credits
have been made for highways, one of $28.0 million in 1969 (Credit 154-IND)
one in 1971 of $34 million (Credit 260-IND) and one in 1973 (Credit 338-IND)
of $14 million. A DFC Credit (310-IND) of $10 million has been partially
used for the rehabilitation of shipping through Bank Pembangunan Indonesia
(BAPINDO) - a national development bank. The disbursement of Credits
154-IND, 260-IND and 388-IND is proceeding satisfactorily. A credit of
$8.5 million (318-IND) for rehabilitation of regular inter-island shipping
services was made in 1972. The credit is being disbursed slowly because
of problems in finding creditworthy borrowers.
1.05      This report is based on the findings of an appraisal mission in
September 1973, composed of Sir Gordon Mackay, railway specialist (consultant),
W. Hughes, economist, 0. S. Murthy, engineer, and F. Sander, financial
analyst (consultant).

II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Indonesia is the world's largest archipelago, comprising about
3,000 islands with a land area of 1.9 million km lying along the Equator.
The island of Java is one of the most densely populated areas in the world
(1,500 persons per sq mi). Sumatra is more sparsely populated but has the
most important export-oriented activities. Java is more subsistence-oriented
but still exports substantial amounts. The population is about 124 million
of which about 80 million live on the main island of Java (1971) and 20 mil-
lion on Sumatra.
2.02      The country is rich in natural resources, one of the most important
being sulphur-free oil, accounting for about 53% of export income. Oil is
assuming an even more important role as a result of recent price increases
and expanding production. Secondary industry is still in its early stages,
with only small factories for textile production, food processing, vehicle
assembly, and metal fabrication. Basic industry is virtually limited to the
manufacture of fertilizers, cement and paper. Many other industrial ventures
are being planned, including nickel refining and aluminum plants.
2.03      Gross national product at current market prices was estimated at
about US$10.7 billion equivalent, or about $88 per capita in 1972. Economic
growth during the period 1968-72 was about 7% p.a. in real terms and similar
growth is expected in the coming five years. Prices were stable between
1968 and 1972, but the drought of 1972 and the substantial increase in the
money supply in 1973 has led to a recurrence of inflation. The contribution
of the oil production sector to the economy, particularly after oil price
increases, will have a favorable influence on the country's internal and
external economic situation.
B. Transport Sector
General
2.04      The Indonesian transport system depends chiefly on highways and
railways and inter-island marine services. Land transport is well developed
in Java with an extensive railway and highway network, whereas in Sumatra
railways have been developed only in some parts, and the road network is
limited to basic links between principal cities. On the other islands,
except for a small railway on Madura, transport facilities are limited to
a few roads in areas around ports and towns. Air transport volume is still
very limited, but has increased rapidly in the last few years.
2.05      In January 1974, the President indicated the broad outlines of
the Second Five Year Plan (Repelita II) which commenced in April.
The Government's strategy is to continue the present rehabilitation program



-3-
for infrastructure and to gradually upgrade the country's transport facilities.
Repelita II also expands the program to improve rural transport, and great
stress is being placed on a regional approach.
2.06      Roughly 10% of Repelita II expenditure is earmarked for transport
(this does not include private investment in road vehicles, ships or invest-
ment of any sort in aircraft); in addition, up to another 10% will go to
transport through various revenue sharing schemes. The largest single ex-
penditure is expected to go to highways.
Road Transport
2.07      The highway network consists of about 82,000 km of all standards,
about 15,000 km paved. In 1971, the road transport fleet totalled 400,000 ve-
hicles of which only 60% were in use because spare parts for many older makes
are difficult to obtain. Most trucks are over ten years old and their aver-
age capacity does not exceed 3.5 tons.
2.08      Road transport is most intensively developed in Java, where a
number of roads carry in excess of 2,000 vehicles per day. Sumatra has
about the same length of roads, but many fewer vehicles. The two islands
together account for about 60% of the highway network and 80% of the vehicles
in the country. After years of neglect, the present Government has emphasized
rehabilitation of the road network. This work was supported under the first
IDA credit for highways (154-IND).
2.09      The Government is now undertaking the improvement of almost 8,000 km
of roads with primary emphasis on pavement strengthening. A proposed fourth
highway project now under preparation is based on the program. Meanwhile,
the second and third IDA highway projects are aiding major reconstruction of
several main roads in Sumatra and Sulawesi. The increased expenditure on
highways under Repelita II will require corresponding increases in the tech-
nical staff of the highway authorities.  A large scale training program for
highway maintenance is being implemented under the third highway project and
it is hoped to continue this type of assistance under future highway projects.
Railways
2.10      Railways are confined (with one minor exception in Madura) to only
two islands, Java with about 4,700 km and Sumatra with about 2,000 km (Maps
10814 and 10815). The system was built up to its present size during the
70 years prior to the World War II, at which time there were six separate
systems and 40% of the network was owned privately. Nationalizatiou took
place in the 1940's and 1950's. Lines built to move primary products to
foreign markets suffered with declining exports of these products in the
1950's and 1960's and, as with most public infrastructure in Indonesia,
railway facilities were allowed to deteriorate. The railway system and
operations are described in detail in Chapter III and the investment program
is described and evaluated in Chapters IV and V.



-4-
Ports and Shipping
2.11      The country has about 300 ports, but the large traffic volumes are
concentrated in 10 ports in Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi and Kalimantan. Port
procedures represent the most serious impediment to transport flows in
Indonesia and their modification could result in significant increases in
port capacity and in general reduction in shipping costs. However, major
changes will take a long time. Studies of short-term port requirements have
been completed with assistance from the Netherlands. The main ports are
being improved with assistance from Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Nether-
lands and Japan. A master plan study of Tanjung Priok (Jakarta), the
largest general cargo port (about 30% of total), was recently begun by a
Canadian firm financed under an IDA Technical Assistance Credit.
2.12      The inter-island shipping fleet suffered from the same neglect
as other modes of transport and the 1972 IDA Credit of US$8.5 million
equivalent was designed to assist in the rehabilitation of part of this
fleet.
River Transport
2.13      With the exception of the Citandui River in Java, coimercial river
transport is limited to 10,000 km of navigable waterway in Kalimantan, Sumatra
and West Irian. Fourteen rivers totalling 4,000 km in Kalimantan and Sumatra
were recently studied by Belgian consultants, and the Government is considering
possible navigational improvements. Logs (Indonesia's second largest export)
are the most important movement.
Pipelines
2.14      Pipelines are under the control of the state-owned oil company -
Pertamina. There is presently only one in operation, a 27 km 12" products
line. Another 420 km are under construction or planned and are expected to
divert significant volumes of traffic from road and rail (some 380,000 tons
from rail by 1976).
Aviation
2.15      There are 47 airports (seven open to international traffic) and
facilities vary widely. Frequent deficiencies, as identified in a recent
study by Aviation Planning Services, are the weak runways, insufficient runway
length and inadequacy of navigational equipment. Most needs are for equipment,
and bilateral finance is likely to be available to support these purchases.
A study to prepare a master plan for Jakarta International Airport is to
start shortly.



-5-
C. Transport Planning
2.16      As explained above, the efforts of the government in the field of
transport planning and investment have in recent years concentrated on the
rehabilitation of the main transport network. This emphasis is to continue
during the Second Five Year Plan period, but it will be supplemented by
the provision of new infrastructure necessary not only for the exploitation
of newly-found resources but also in support of the government's regional
policies. A recently created planning department in the Ministry of
Communications is to help in evaluating projects.
2.17      Although only two ministries, Works and Power in the case of
highways and the Ministry of Communications in the case of other modes, are
responsible for proposals for investment in transport which are then reviewed
by the National Planning Council (BAPPENAS), selection of projects in recent
years has been made in a rather haphazard manner. This has been partly
because of lack of qualified technical staff to prepare, evaluate and rank
investment priorities. Due to the scarcity of experienced staff, transport
planning is not well organized and investment projects are prepared generally
without adequate analysis. In order to improve this situation, the Govern-
ment retained a group of consultants between 1969 and 1973 to assist
transport planning for BAPPENAS and the Ministry of Communications. The
consultant services were financed by the UNDP, and the Bank acted as
executing agency. These consultants have contributed in collecting and
analyzing transport data and setting up procedures for investment project
review, but their tasks are far from completed. It will be some years
before the Government has all the required staff and therefore some continued
outside expert assistance is necessary. The Government intends to retain
for the Ministry of Communications, with financing from the Bank Group's
technical assistance credit (451-IND), about five advisors (with initial
contracts for 2 years) on transport coordination, investment programming,
pricing and accounting. In addition, UNDP funds are available for provid-
ing advisors to assist BAPPENAS in project evaluation and resource evaluation.
2.18      The Bank's Resident Staff in Indonesia is currently engaged in a
review of the transport sector, examining past achievements and considering
measures required for improving efficiency and performance in the sector.
This should be of assistance in formulating future strategy for economic
assistance to the sector.
III. THE INDONESIAN STATE RAILWAYS
A.   Organization and Management
3.01      The Indonesian State Railways is the largest railway system in
Southeast Asia, handling about 4.9 million tons and 1.1 billion ton-km of
freight traffic and about 30 million passengers and 2.7 billion pass-km
p.a. (1973). By a Presidential Decree of September 15, 1971, the Government
decided to change the Railways from a statutory corporation under the Minister



- 6 -
of Communications to a government agency - or PJKA - under the same Minister.
As a corporation, the Railway theoretically had powers to maintain its own
budget, to raise funds, to contract and to institute legal proceedings and
was expected to operate on business principles and be financially viable.
In practice, however, the organization was not strong enough financially to
stand on its own feet as a corporation.
3.02      Details of the Government's control of PJKA and of PJKA's current
internal organization are given in Annex 1 and the accompanying organization
charts.
3.03      The conversion of the Railways into a government agency, resulting
in the loss of their legal personality, legalized a position which already
existed. As a government agency PJKA has its own management and accounts
and a separate section of the national budget. 1/ The powers of the
Minister in regard to policy matters and his responsibility to provide
railway services to the public through PJKA remain unaltered; and the powers
of the previous Board of Directors in regard to executive matters have been
vested largely in a sole Chief Director. The Government has indicated that
it wishes PJKA to operate commercially and become financially viable as soon
as possible. Once this goal has been achieved, the Government can consider
recreating the railway as a corporation (see Chapter V).
3.04      The limitation of the Chief Director's powers on policy matters
does not interfere with the effective day-to-day management of the railway,
and communications between the Ministry and the Chief Director are generally
good. To assist PJKA to be responsive to the needs of users and to foster
commercial practice, the Government is setting up consultative councils
(a) at the national railway, and (b) at divisional railway levels (see next
para). The Bank will cooperate in defining the duties and functions of
these councils which are to be introduced at the earliest practical date.
3.05      The Chief Director is supported by a divisional organization
which delegates considerable management responsibility to six divisions,
three in Java and three in Sumatra. This works reasonably well but coor-
dination is hampered by distance and poor telecommunications. The provi-
sion of better telecommunications under the Investment Plan should improve
the situation.
3.06      In general, management is good in spite of problems related to past
neglect, inadequate finances, obsolete and badly maintained equipment and
relatively inexperienced staff at the operating level. Assistance In easAing
these problems will be found in the proposed Project, which will rehabilitate
1/   The budget arrangements are not yet in force; PJKA's accounts will
not be ready for inclusion in the state budget until FY75/76, beginning
April 1, 1975.



-7-
the plant and equipment and provide technical assistance, the need for which
is accepted by the Government and PJKA. Details of the technical assistance
to be provided under the proposed loan are outlined in Annex 2.
3.07      Management's organizational structure has to be strengthened to
permit more efficient control. Measures outlined in Annex 1, to allow closer,
more specialized control and to redace present bottlenecks, have been
discussed with the Bank and are in ,rocess of introduction.
B. Staff
3.08      Since 1966, the nutnber of staff employed by the Railways has
decreased from 88,586 to a figure of about 60,000 (July 1973). The Govern-
ment, in conjunction with PJKA, intends to continue the policy of selective
early retirements to achieve a net reduction of 12,000 and a total staff of
48,000 by 1979. Staff employed and their costs and productivity for 1972
projected through 1979 are shown in Table 1. Over the period, there will
be a varying number of inactive staff receiving severance pay (Table 10,
page 3).
3.09      The reductions in staff will be facilitated by increases in staff
efficiency made possible by new investments under the Five Year Development
Plan (e. g., dieselization), by operational and management improvements and
by stmplifications in organization and procedure and by increased training
of both new and existing staff, on the job and overseas, supported by a
program of short-term technical assistance. The Government and PJKA agree
that reduction of skilled staff will be carefully controlled and coordinated
with the output of effective training programs so that the efficient execu-
tion of the Project is not prejudiced.
3.10      Emoluments for all cadres of staff are low, ranging in 1973 from
about Rp 7,000 to about Rp 65,000 per month. These emoluments, which are
in line with other Government paid services, include family and other
allowances, and payments in rice and sugar. Housing is free. A program
begun in 1971 increases all basic salaries through 1975 at the rate of 100%
p.a. of that in 1970, which then averaged Rp 20,000 p.a. The cost of these
increases is being offset, to a great extent, by progressive decreases in
the number of staff. The relation of projected staff costs (which make
allowance for further salary increases) to estimated operating expenses
remains satisfactory at around 40%. Staff productivity, which is currently
on the low side, is expected to increase to a satisfactory level.
C. Accounting and Audit
3.11      Budget preparation, bookkeeping and presentation of the final
accounts are the responsibility of the Chief Finance Officer, who reports to
the Director, Commercial. Under the same Directorate, there is a Controller,



- 8 -
whose staff carry out the duties of internal audit. The system should be
modernized. For example, the classification of expenditure fails to provide
the data needed for financial management and costing, and internal audit
does not include inventory verification, which is carried out by officers
employed by and responsible to the Stores and Purchasing Department. The
Government and PJKA agree that the nost suitable manner of revising the
system would be to engage a firm of public accountants, established in
Indonesia, to assist and advise the staff of the railway. PJKA will also
revise its accounting and internal audit procedures in accordance with
accepted standards of modern practice and will establish a traffic costing
system by June 30, 1976.
3.12      The Government Audit Department has an office in PJKA headquarters
in Bandung and sub-offices in each of the Regions. The officer in charge
is a qualified accountant of considerable ability and energy, and the conduct
and scope of the work of his subordinates attain standards acceptable to the
Bank.
D. Railway Property
3.13      Annex 3 describes in detail the physical assets of PJKA.
Track and Structures
3.14      PJKA operates a system of 6,793 route-km almost wholly of 1,067
mm gauge, of which 182 km are double track and 110 km are electrified on
1,500 volts DC. There are six geographically unconnected systems serving
the islands of Java, Madura and Sumatra (Maps 10814 and 10815). Of these,
the most important is in Java - 4,834 route-km, of which 2,792 are mainlines.
The latter are laid mostly with 41.52 kg/m and 33.4 kg/r rail while the
branch lines have 25.7 kg/m rails. Sleepers are mostly hardwood and ballast
is broken stone or gravel. The track is maintained by manual labor.
About 20% of sleepers on the mainlines and 35% of those on branch lines are
in poor condition. Track fittings need large scale replacement. The
ballast is inadequate except for a few sections on the mainlines of Java.
In the absence of systematic methods of maintenance, the standard of track
is unsatisfactory. Speed restrictions have been imposed over long
stretches. Bridges and other structures are generally in satisfactory
condition.
3.15      PJKA was planning to rehabilitate the mainlines in Java for speeds
of 100 km/h. Apart from the heavy investments involved, adequate maintenance
of track for such speeds on relatively narrow gauge track raises serious
problems. It has been agreed by the Government that, during the Plan period,
maximum permissible speeds would not be raised from the present limits of
80/90 km/h.
3.16      Telecommunications rely on the telephone and a radio network linked
to a few stations. The signalling is mainly mechanical and varies from



-9-
modern type operated by double wire and tokenless block instruments to out-
moded wooden lever frame and disc typeat. Improved signalling is necessary
on considerable sections of the main line. Except on a few sections in
Java, there is little centralized train control. A sophisticated radio
train despatch system between Jakarta and Cirebon has recently been brought
into commission. A cheaper selector operated telephone network on existing
wires, similar to systems which have been working satisfactorily on other
railways in Southeast Asia, would be adequate for train despatch and exten-
sion of radio train despatch will not be undertaken during the period of the
Project unless the Bank otherwise agrees. For administrative purposes an
expanded radio network supported by teleprinter circuits is required.
Motive Power and Rolling Stock
3.17      Table 2 shows the details and age of the motive power fleet and
rolling stock on the books of PJYA as of June 30, 1973. The fleet includes
570 steam and 311 diesel locomotives, about 22,000 freight cars and 2,500
passenger cars. A large part of the motive power and rolling stock is
either out of commission or too old to function efficiently. A major reason
for the high repair ratio is lack of spare parts.
Workshops and Maintenance Depots
3.18      Locomotives and passenger and freight cars are repaired and main-
tained in five workshops in Java and two in Sumatra as well as about 35 line-
maintenance depots (Annex 3). With the gradual withdrawal of steam locomo-
tives and wooden body passenger cars, three workshops at Mangarrai (near
Jakarta), Jogjakarta and Surabaya, should suffice in Java, with two small
workshops serving Sumatra. Part of the Madiun Shop (Java) will be utilized
for permanent way work.
3.19      All the workshops except Jogjakarta are very old and ill-equipped.
While the output suffers from lack of imported spare parts, better produc-
tion planning, methods and control are needed. To achieve this, technical
assistance and training form part of the Project.
3.20      Line-maintenance depots are ill-equipped, resulting in light
repairs being transferred to workshops. The Project provides for better
equipment for the depots.
3.21      The bridge and structural fabricating workshop at Bandung is
capable of producing 1,000 tons of steel bridge girders per annum. Capacity
will be expanded to 2,000 tons p.a. under the Project.

E.  Traffic
Freight Traffic
3.22      Annex 4 describes past traffic trends and forecasts the future.
PJKA's revenue-earning freight traffic for the period 1962-72 is shown in
Table 3. From 1962 through 1966 ton-km carried declined by about 23% be-
cause of poor quality of railway service, increased competition from road
transport for short hauls, and reduced production of rubber, coffee and
coal.
3.23      Between 1967 and 1972, the traffic increased at about 9% p.a.
because of the improved economic climate and as a result of modest additions
to rolling stock. In 1973, traffic again increased, by 7%, to over 1.1 bil-
lion ton-km (Tables 4 and 5).
3.24      For the period 1974 through 1979, the composition of rail traffic
is expected to change because of a drop in the proportion of traffic in
oil and oil products (due to the construction of oil pipe lines) and an
increase in the proportion of agricultural and forestry products. Table 6
shows mission's forecasts of PJKA's freight traffic from 1974 through 1979.
The average overall rate of growth for the period will be just under 5% p.a.
Passenger Traffic
3.25      Table 7 shows the PJKA's passenger traffic from 1962 through 1973.
During this period, passenger traffic decreased, from 7,049 to 3,352 million
pass-km. The growing competition from road transport including "civic
missions" by the military, the poor and unreliable service offered by the
railways) reduction in operations on branch lines, and the cancellation of
some commuter services because of lack of locomotives and passenger cars,
all contributed to the decline. During 1973 there was a further sharp drop
of about 20Z in pass-km. This was the result of further contraction of train
services, coupled with a substantial increase (about 30%) in basic passenger
fares introduced in May 1973, which discouraged short-distance passenger
traffic. However, overall passenger revenue increased in 1973.
3.26      Table 7 shows the forecast of PJKA passenger traffic for the
period 1974-79. The forecast for 1979 at 40.4 million passengers and
3,724 pass-km is only slightly higher than the 1972 levels. The railway
remains a major carrier of long-distance passengers, and many of the services
are overcrowded. With the renewal and rehabilitation of track and passenger
cars ensuring faster and more regular passenger services, it is reasonable
to expect passenger traffic to recover, especially for long distances.1/
1/   During negotiations the Bank was advised of a recent Government decision
to use PJKA for reasons of safety and orderly transportation, for the
movement of all passengers under the Transmigration Program from East
and Central Java to Sumatra.



- 11 -
F. Operations
3.27      Tables 4 and 5 summarize operating statistics.  The most signi-
ficant feature of operations in Java is the predominance of passenger
services. Another feature of note is the poor availability of both motive
power and rolling stock, due to lack of spares and inadequate repair
facilities.
3.28      Many mixed trains are operated on main lines.  A study of the
need for mixed trains will be included in the terms of reference of the
team to provide technical assistance in the field of train operations
(Annex 2).
3.29      In 1972, the average net load of freight trains was only 101
tons in Java, and 80 tons in Sumatra. Serviceable freight cars ran only 50
km per day. Substantial improvements in operations could be achieved
through more intensive utilization of diesel locomotives, including
extended locomotive runs, especially for through freight services.
3.30      As part of the recovery plan included in the Project (para 4.10),
PJKA's operations will be improved by the end of 1976/77 to realize an
increase of 20% in average net train loads in Java and 25% in Sumatra, together
with an increase of 10X in car-km per car day, improvement in diesel locomo-
tive availability from 70% at present to 83% and freight car availability
from 83% to 95%.
IV. THE INVESTMENT PLAN AND THE PROJECT
A. The Investment Plan
4.01      A five-year Railway Plan prepared by PJKA has been accepted by the
Government and the Bank and will be incorporated in the transport sector of
the Government's Second Five Year Plan (1974/75-1978/79).1/ The main objec-
tive of the Plan is to remedy the neglect of the past 25 years and, by
creating adequate facilities and training for proper repair and maintenance,
to assure"the sustained provision of more efficient railway service. Annex
5 describes in detail the proposed investment, which is estimated to cost
Rp 103 billion (US$248 million equivalent) with a foreign exchange component
of US$150 million equivalent.
1/   The original Railway Plan, based on a report submitted by DECONSULT,
a firm of consultants commissioned by the Federal Republic of Germany
as part of technical and requested by the Indonesian Government, was
revised following the appraisal mission's discussions with PJKA and
the Government.



- 12 -
4.02      The Plan does not include investment for urban rail transport
in Jakarta, which has recently been intensively studied. The Goverment
has agreed to furnish the Bank with the results of the studies and will
not undertake any major PJKA investment in this project without the prior
agreement of the Bank.
4.03      The main items included in the Plan (Table 8) are:  the rehabil-
itation of the main lines of Java and to a limited extent those of Sumatra;
rehabilitation and improvements of signalling and telecommunications; re-
habilitation of 59 diesel locomotives, 290 passenger cars and 4 diesel rail
cars; the procurement of 60 diesel locomotives, 10 sets (of two cars each)
of electric rail cars, and 12 sets (of two cars each) of diesel rail cars,
61 passenger cars, 300 bogie freight cars (including 120 ballast hopper cars);
fitting air brakes on about 7,500 freight cars and automatic couplers on
about 670 freight cars; improvements to repair facilities; re-stocking of
inventories and training and extensive technical assistance in management
and operations.  The technical assistance is expected to be through teas
of expatriates from large railways working in the field alongside Indonesian
counterparts for limited periods ranging from two to three years (pars 13 of
Annex 5). A summary of the Plan is as follows:
Rp Billion      US$ Million
Estimated         Estimated
Total    F.E.   Total      F.E.

Total                     103.0   62.2    248.3   150.0
4.04      Track rehabilitation in Java includes (i) the north line in Java,
(ii) other sections of the main line system and (iii) maintenance tools
and plant. The North line includes completion of re-laying of track between
Jakarta and Semarang and limited expenditure beyond Semarang (Annex 5, para
1).
4.05      Improvements to telecommunication will include a radio and tele-
printer network connecting major centers of railway activity.
4.06      With the rehabilitation of existing diesel locomotives, their
better utilization and the acquisition of 60 new locomotives, PJKA should
be in a position by 1979 to run all main line services in Java and the
majority of main line services in Sumatra with diesels. The recovery plan
(para 4.16) includes a phased program of withdrawal of steam locomotives
(Annex 5, page 11).



- 13 -
4.07      Also included in the recovery plan, and consequent upon the
rehabilitation of passenger and freight cars and their better availability,
is the scrapping of many over-aged cars presently lying unused in the yards
(Annex 5, paras 8 and 9).
4.08      Due to lack of foreign exchange, PJKA's stocks of spare parts
and components have been badly depleted. The Plan provides for re-stocking
inventories.
4.09      To get the fullest realization of benefits from the investments,
the Plan provides for extensive technical assistance in all important aspects
of PJKA's activities, supplemented by a well coordinated program of staff
training in both management and operational fields (Annex 2).
B. The Project and the Proposed Loan
4.10      The purpose of the Bank's involvement in the Project is to
assist PJKA in effecting improvements in its functioning through technical
assistance in most aspects of its operations, building up of inventories,
rehabilitation of its assets, and generally through identifying priority
areas requiring investments. The proposed Project consists of improvements
and investments during the first three years of the Plan, aimed at enabling
the railways to regain and maintain, their proper economic role and financial
viability. It includes a recovery plan agreed between the Government and
the Bank designed to allow PJKA to break even not later than fiscal year
1979/80. The Project includes the rehabilitation of track and signalling,
the rehabilitation of 59 diesel locomotives, 120 passenger cars, 4 diesel
cars; the procurement of 40 diesel locomotives, 10 sets of electric rail
cars and 12 sets of diesel rail cars, 61 passenger cars, 200 bogie freight
cars; fitting of air brakes on about 3,680 freight cars and automatic
couplers on 670 freight cars; and technical assistance in most fields of
railway operation. Details are as shown in Table 9. The total cost of the
Project is estimated at US$158 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
cost of US$98 million equivalent, of which the proposed loan will finance
US$48 million.  Items to be financed by the proposed loan are detailed in
Annex 6. A summary of the Project and loan expenditure is shown below.

(c) a built-in allowance of 10% for physical contingencies on civil and track
works.



- 15 -
C. Execution of the Project
4.11      PJKA are competent to execute the Project, with the technical
assistance provided in the Project.
4.12      The cost estimates for equipment, components, spares and other
material are based on latest known prices. Price contingencies on imported
goods are based on assumptions of 12% p.a. increases and an 18-month average
delivery period, resulting in an overall provision for the Project period
of 20% over current cost estimates. The overall local provision for contin-
gencies is 25Z made up of 10% built-in provision for civil and track works,
with a further 15% for price contingencies.
D. Procurement and Disbursement
4.13      Procurement of all items financed under the loan will be through
intehnational competitive bidding, in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines
except for certain components and spare parts required for equipment already
in service estimated to cost about US$6.5 million. Non-competitive procure-
ment will be negotiated mainly with original suppliers in consultation with
the Bank.
4.14      PJKA will employ consultants or agents acceptable to the Bank to
assist in the preparation of tender documents and in handling the procedures
required by the Guidelines for Procurement under Bank loans. The proposed
loan will be disbursed against the full c.i.f. cost of imports and the
foreign exchange costs of technical assistance; an estimated disbursement
schedule is shown in Annex 7.
4.15      Any saving under the loan will be used to finance additional, but
similar, Project items, subject to review and agreement with the Bank.
E. Financing of the Project
4.16      The following table summarizes the financing plan of the Project:
Financed from:                       RP Billion    US$ Million        X

- 16 -
4.17      During the three years of the Project, PJKA will be unable to
contribute funds for capital investment. In later years, when the benefits
of the rehabilitation plan are realized, PJKA's contribution will be substan-
tial, as indicated in para 5.12.
V. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC EVALUATION
A. Financial Background
5.01      The financial discipline of PJKA's operations has for many years
been governed by the principle that cash operating costs should not exceed
operating revenue. This objective has generally been achieved, although
at the expense of unduly restricting maintenance and repair expense.
Provision for depreciation has been merely nominal. All funds for capital
investment, whether for replacement or for increased capacity, have been
provided by the Government, but such capital transactions in recent years
have not been recorded in the railway's books.
5.02      It has been necessary therefore to quantify and evaluate the
capital assets in productive use, to calculate depreciation, and from
the resultant data to reconstruct the existing financial position and
make projections of the future, commensurate with the approved traffic
foreeast. The resultant figures are shown in Table 10, Income Account,
Table 11, Cash Flow and Table 12, Balance Sheets.
B. Rates, Fares and Costs
5.03      On May 2, 1973, PJKA increased both freight and passenger
tariffs substantially. The new passenger tariff fixes fares on a graduated
scale for individual trains and categories of train related to the standard
of speed, comfort and service offered. A passenger may, for example, pay
more for a third class ticket on a superior train than for a second class
ticket on an inferior one. A high minimum fare is prescribed to discourage
short-distance travel. The principles upon which the passenger fare struc-
ture is based are sound. Long-run variable cost constitutes the floor for
pricing, and quality of service dictates the ceiling. The cost statement
for the Jakarta-Bandung express service, presented in Table 13, shows a
substantial excess of receipts over costs; although fares are relatively high,
the service is well patronized, reflecting the public's evaluation of the
superiority of railway service over road on this route.
5.04      The revised freight tariff follows traditional patterns of
charging on the basis of "what the traffic will bear." As in the previous
years, it consists of six class rates. On the basis of 1973 costs the
tariff has the following deficiencies:



- 17 -
(a)  All class rates are too low at distances below 100 km;
(b) Class 6 is too low at all distances; and
(c) the minimum wagon-load for charging is 9 tons for a
two-axle wagon, but no differential preference is
given for loading to maximum capacity although the
cost differential per ton of net load as between 9
tons and 15 tons per wagon (the maximum for a two-axle
wagon) is 33%.
These three weaknesses will be corrected not later than May 31, 1975.
5.05      It has been further agreed (a) that PJKA's tariffs will be revised
from time to time in the light of costs and market conditions and (b) that
the revenues from each freight and passenger class will meet long-run
variable operating costs and make a contribution towards fixed costs. Tech-
nical assistance is being provided to assist with the costing requirement.
A detailed cost analysis relating to the past 3 years is included in Table
14.
C. Financial Prospects and Targets
5.06      In Table 10, the forecast income account to 1979 is shown.
The forecast incorporates all foreseeable increases in wage and material
price levels, offset by economies which may realistically be expected from
staff reductions and from dieselization, mDdernization and improvement of
operating standards. Depreciation is included, and is based on the replace-
ment value of existing productive and renewable plant and equipment, with
such additions as are needed to handle the traffic projection, and service
lives related to acceptable standards of utilization of the assets. The
resulting figures for depreciation range from Rp 5,040 million in 1973 to
Rp 6,500 million in 1979.
5.07      On these bases, it is projected that PJKA will cover all operating
costs, including depreciation, in 1979/80 and earn a small return on the
investment, about 1-1/4%.
5.08      In 1979/80, therefore, PJKA should have attained a financial
situation in which consideration could again be given to re-establishing
it as a statutory corporation, with financial autonomy and the ability
to finance a large part of its capital investment (see para 5.14). Until
then, as agreed with the Government, there is little alternative but to
consider the Government's contribution to railway investment as a
contribution to equity, on which a return is unlikely to be earned before
1979. At that time, a decision can be made in the light of longer-ranged
financial projections as to what return PJKA should pay to the Government
for the latter's investment in the railways.



- 18 -
5.09      In the meantime, PJKA remains short of sufficient working cash
for efficient operation. It will be necessary for the Government to cover
PJKA's operating cash deficiencies, probably to late 1976, and in addition
to provide now sufficient funds to bring PJKA's working cash balances up
to an adequate level, assessed at six weeks' (i.e., about 12%) of the
annual working cash requirements at the level of operation current at the
relevant time. This has been agreed and substantial progress has already
been made towards reaching this level.
5.10      Other financial targets on which agreement has been reached are
as follows:
(a) that in the light of the findings of studies currently
being made by consultants (DECONSULT) of the financial,
economic and operating justification of feeder lines in
Java, and of the recorded financial results of the West
Sumatra and Aceh railway systems, the Government will
decide by October 1975 whether these lines are to be
continued in operation and, where they are, will coupensate
PJKA for any losses incurred thereon;
(b) that until the Project shall have been completed no
capital expenditure shall be incurred outside the
Project exceeding, say US$1,500,000 in any one year, or
US$500,000 on any individual work; and
(c) that PJKA shall achieve operating ratios of 140 by 1974/75,
improving to 131 by 1976/77 and to 100 or better by 1979/80.
D. Fihancing of the Plan
5.11      The financing of the Plan is forecast as follows:
Rp Billion    US$ Million    %
Funds Required
Capital development and rehabilitation
program (Repelita II), 1974/75 to
1978/79                                    103.1          248.3      97.1
Other capital investment                      1.5            3.6       1.4

- 19 -
5.12      Completion of the Plan is assumed to carry over into 1979/80.
In each year from 1974/75 onward, provision of Rp 250 million is made for
unforeseen works not included in Repelita II. It will be noted that, assuming
the projection to be realistic, the local currency needs of the Plan will
be provided 27% from PJKA cash generation and 73% from Government resources.
As, however, PJKA contributions are, in effect, benefits which will accrue
from the investment, they naturally increase over time, while Government
contributions correspondingly decrease, as shown below:
PJKA       Government        Total
Rp million
1974/75      (1,853),         8,211         6,358
1975/76      (1,220)          7,717         6,497
1976/77      (  328)         10,118         9,790
1977/78       2,106           5,475         7,581
1978/79       4,993             551         5,544
1979/80       8,144             -           8,144
Total      11,842          32,072        43,914
5.13      Bilateral lending is not yet fully committed, but there is
little doubt that it will become available.  The possibility of a further
Bank Group operation is not overlooked, but the need for it can only be
assessed after the Plan has been underway for some time.
E. Reconstructed Balance Sheet
5.14      Balance sheets, reconstructed on commercial lines, are shown
in Table 12. All capital investment financed by borrowing or from the
Government and PJKA's own resources is classified as Government equity
investment in the railways up to the end of the period of the projections.
From 1979/80 onward, PJKA should be able to provide all local currency
required for future investment and to accept responsibility for debt in
respect of any further borrowing for railway development. At that time its
re-establishment as a public corporation could be considered.
F. Economic Evaluation
5.15      As already mentioned, the relative importance of the railway
system has declined in recent years with the development of other modes
of transport, which is a normal phenomenon. However, this has been
seriously aggravated by the neglect of both physical assets and operational
efficiency for almost 25 years, which led to the inability to offer a
service comparable with that provided in the 1940's, and consequent loss
of traffic. In spite of inadequate facilities, the railways still retain
important traffic on medium and long haul routes that give them a competitive



- 20 -
advantage over any alternatives. The basic rationale for PJKA's 1974-79
Investment Plan and the accompanying measures for managerial and operational
improvements proposed is that by reducing costs and providing more attractive
services, they will retain traffic which they would lose if the railways'
plant and equipment were allowed to deteriorate further, and also recover
some of the traffic lost in recent years because of PJKA's inability to
accept it.
5.16      Tne 1974-79 Investment Plan is a coordinated program of
rehabilitation and modernization designed to enable the railways to
perform efficiently and carry the rail traffic forecast during the Plan
period. Most of PJKA's investment will be devoted to the rehabilitation
of main trunk lines and the replacement of rolling stock for services on
these lines. Rehabilitation now will prevent further rapid deterioration
of assets and increase in costs of maintenance of essential lines. If
the Plan is not implemented, declining quality of service and diminishing
capability to move traffic will result in diversion to other, more
expensive, modes of traffic and, where there are no such alternatives,
to the cessation of traffic.
5.17      The benefits from the various items in the Plan (moderniza-
tion of workshops, rehabilitation and replacement of freight and passenger
cars and motive power, the rehabilitation of track, etc.) are interdependent
and will be realized through complementary improvements in the areas of
management, operations and training. Thus, although during the preparation
of the Plan all the items proposed for inclusion were scrutinized closely,
these have been grouped together for purposes of cost/benefit analysis.
Costs
5.18      All investment in physical assets under the Plan have been allo-
cated to freight and passenger services on the Java and Sumatra systems,
either directly, in the case of freight and passenger cars, or in proportion
to the relative amount of capacity which the investments will provide for
each service on each of the islands, in the case of locomotives and track.
Investment in training and technical assistance has been allocated to the
four main groups of investment according to the assessed degree of improve-
ment needed to achieve adequate standards of efficiency in each of the
relevant areas of operation. Operating costs are projected at constant
prices for each of the forecast levels of traffic volume (Table 15).
Benefits
5.19      The benefits arise from the reduction in costs in operation of
the services, especially because of increased use of diesel traction, and
from avoided costs of diversion of traffic to higher-cost modes of transport
if the railway investment were not to be undertaken. In implementing the
Plan, about 260 main line steam locomotives in Java and about 131 in Sumatra
would be retired from service, resulting in substantial cost reductions.
Without the rehabilitation of passenger and freight cars, it would be neces-
sary to purchase new cars to carry the level of traffic offered and expected
or divert the traffic to roads at a higher cost. Building up of adequate



- 21 -
inventories which hitherto have been completely depleted would result in
improved maintenance and better availability of rolling stock. The substan-
tial technical assistance to be provided will contribute to an all-round
improvement in operational efficiency. The benefits described above do not
include improvements in safety associated with investment in signalling,
track, ballast, bridges, and to that extent the benefits are understated.
Rate of Return
5.20      The economic rate of return has been calculated for four groups of
investments. Over an assumed life of twenty years, the economic rate of
return would be:
Java      Sumatra
Freight movement.          33%         29%
Passenger movement         14%         27%
The overall rate of return on the investment during the Plan would be 23%.
Assuming that investment costs (rail and road vehicle) increase by 15%,
the economic return would be 19%. If investment costs increase by 15%,
railway operating costs incrdase by 15% and road transport costs decrease
by 15%, the rate of return wduld be 15%. These returns are satisfactory.
Economic return calculations are shown in Table 15.
VI. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION
6.01      During negotiations agreement was reached on the following principal
points:
(a)  the carrying out by PJKA of a comprehensive recovery plan
embracing:
- provision of technical assistance (paras 3.06 and 4.14);
- strengthening of PJKA's organizational structure (para 3.07);
- phased staff reductions (para 3.09);
- modernization of accounting and establishment of traffic
costing (para 3.11);
- improved operations (para 3.30); and
- tariff revisions (paras 5.04 and 5.05),
which together will help PJKA to achieve an operating ratio of
100 or better by no later than 1979/80 (para 5.10) (c));
(b)  provision of funds by the Government for capital investment
(para 5.08) and for adequate working capital (para 5.09).



- 22 -
(c) action to compensate PJKA for losses on unprofitable lines
retained in service (para 5.10) (a)).
6.02      The proposed Project provides a suitable basis for a Bank loan
of US$48 million to the Government of Indonesia.

APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
Indonesian State Railways
Notes on the Organization and Management of PJKA
A.   The Railway as a Corporation
1.        By Presidential Decree (Peraturan Pemerintah) No. 22 of May 25,
1963, the railways were organized as a Perusahaan Negara Kereta Api (PNKA),
or statutory corporation under the Minister of Communications. Under this
decree PNKA had powers to maintain its own budget, to raise funds, to sue
and be sued, and was expected to operate on business principles and be fi-
nancially viable. In practice, however, PNKA was not strong enough to
stand on its own feet as a corporation: its revenues were barely sufficient
to cover working costs and the Government's financial support was needed
for the maintenance of operations and for capital investment.
B.  The Change to a Government Agency
2.        In the circumstances outlined above, the Government decided to
change PNKA into a government agency or Perusahaan Jawatan Kereta Api
(PJKA), and a Presidential Decree No. 61 was published to this effect on
September 15, 1971. As a government agency, although without legal personality
PJKA has its own management and accounts and is to have a separate section
of the national budget, with its accounts kept separate as distinct from
a government department. The accounts will not be ready for inclusion in the
state budget until fiscal year 1974/75, beginning April 1, 1974.
3.        The conversion of the railways into a government agency is, in
effect, legalizing a position which already existed; and the change is
being made easier by the fact that the terms and conditions of service of
the railway staff are in line with those of the Government. The only material
alteration - which has already been made - has been to abolish the Board of
Directors (consisting of the Chief Director and four technical Directors
responsible for the day-to-day management of the railway) and vest the powers
of the Board solely in the Chief Director. The powers of the Minister and
his responsibility to provide railway services to the public through PJKA
remain unaltered, and the Government has indicated (a) that it wishes PJKA
to operate commercially and become financially viable as soon as possible;
and (b) that given the achievement of this goal, it would consider changing
the railway back to corporation status.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
C.   Relations of PJKA to the Government
4.        The relations of PJKA to the Government are shown in Chart A
to this annex.  The Minister .of Communications in addition to having respon-
sibility for the railways is In chargd of road transportation (excluding
road construct:ion), sea transport and ports, inland waterways, aviation,
telecommunications and tourism. In exercise of his responsibility for PJKA,
the Minister gives directions of a general character, controls both the
capital and working expenditure budgets (in conjunction with the Ministers
of Finance and of the National Planning Board), and sets the upper limits
of rates and fares. He exercises these powers directly or through a
Director General of Land Transport and Inland Waterways.
D.   Powers of the Management
5.        Responsibility for the day-to-day management of PJKA is vested in
a Chief Director, appointed for a period of five years, who reports to the
Minister through the Director General of Land Transport. The powers of
the Chief Director are circumscribed in relation to senior staff appoint-
ments, changes in staff policy, the authorization of capital expenditure,
changes in budget allocations already authorized, and increases in tariffs.
In general, however, apart from some physical difficulty arising from
having the Headquarters of PJKA at Bandung, 189 km from the seat of the
Government at Jakarta, communication between the Chief Director, the Director
General of Land Transport and the Minister is good and the limitation of
the Chief Director's powers is reasonable in relation to PJKA's status as
a government agency.
E.   Organization of PJKA
6.        Organizationally, the railway is divided into six regional divi-
sions (three in Java and three in Sumatra) called the Eksplotasi and 15 sub-
divisions of technical staff called the Inspeksi. The organization support-
ing the Chief Director (Chart B to this annex) consists of four Directors
at Headquarters with responsibility for the operations of all railway
activities shared departmentally between them; six Chiefs of Ek8plotasi
(Divisional Managers) and 15 Inspeksi (sub-divisions of the technical
staff). The Chiefs of Eksplotasi report directly to the Chief Director and
the Inspeksi go for guidance to the functional departments at Headquarters
under the four Directors. This divisional organization, which delegates
considerable management responsibility and status to the Chiefs of
Eksplotasi, has its justification in the geographical spread of the system
over two islands (Java/Madura and Sumatra) spanning some 3,000 km and in
the previous history of sectionalism and regional independence (up to
1945, when there were 13 different railway companies, including the State
Railway).



ANNEX 1
Page  3
F.   Weaknesses in the Organization
7.        Overall, the support organization outlined above works reasonably
well but distances and poor telecommunications cause some difficulties to
the central management in coordinating all aspects of the railways working.
Efforts are being made to improve this situation through the provision of
better telecommunications (to be extended under the Railway Five Year In-
vestment Plan) and the introduction of operational changes such as central-
ized wagon control.
8.        Other weaknesses are:  a shortage of experienced staff in the
middle and lower ranges of management; a lack of adequate operational and
financial data for day-to-day management; an inadequate accounting system.
There is also need for traffic costing to provide a basis for tariff
adjustments and investment evaluation; and there is a lack of stores exper-
tise in forecasting the spares and other material needs of PJKA and in taking
timely action to see that these needs are met.
9.        The organizational structure of management also needs strengthening
- a process which has already begun. Until recently, one Director (for
Operating/Transportation) had responsibility for all civil engineering (way
and works), for locomotive running, for traffic operations, for signalling
and telecommunications and for ferry services. This is too wide and diverse
a span of work to be covered by one officer. Responsibility for locomotive
running has now been transferred to the Director responsible for locomotive
workshops/maintenance and consideration is being given to setting up a
separate "fixed installations" or civil engineering directorate, which would
also assume responsibility for signalling and telecommunications. This
would leave one Director to concentrate on operations and commercial services.
Proposed changes to central management designed to give closer, more spe-
cialized and efficient control, are below.
G.   Proposed Changes in Management and Organization
Present                Proposed          Principal Areas of Control
Director Personnel       Director Personnel  Personnel; training; welfare
Director Commerce        Director Finance    Accounting; internal audit;
statistics; costing
Director Operating/       Director Transpor-  Trains; ferries; tariffs; marketing;
Transportation            tation              claims
Director Civil      Way and works; signalling and
Engineering         and communications
Director Supply/          Director Mechanical Workshops; depots; traction;
Workshops                Engineering         electrical engineering
Director Stores     Stores purchase and issue;
inventory control
Additionally there is need to ensure that the Chief Director's Office has adequate
expertise for research and planning and investment evaluation purposes. The
recent appointment of two economists is a step in this direction.

APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
Outline of (A) Training and (B) Technical Assistance Proposals
A.   Training
Consultants' (DECONSULT) Proposals
1.        The Railways' needs for training were examined in 1972 by consult-
ants (DECONSULT, Germany), who recommended:
(a) for general railway training - the enlarging of the
existing training schools at Bandung and Jogjakarta
from 250 study and bed places to 775 study and 650
bed places;
(b) for mechanical workshops and depot training - the
provision of training facilities near the main work-
shops of Mangarrai (Jakarta), Jogjakarta and
Surabaya and, for Sumatra, at Palembang;
(c)  for permanent way training - the provision of a
specially equipped and manned train to travel
round the system and train staff on the job;
(d) for management training - the building of a staff
college, possibly in Bandung; and
(e) for teacher training - the financing of technical
assistance.
The consultants estimated the implementation of their proposals
to cost US$2.15 million in foreign exchange and Rp 1.6 billion (US$3.85 million)
in local currency, and the proposals have been accepted in principle by
the Government and PJKA.
Normal Recruitment
2.        PJKA has no difficulty in recruiting elementary and secondary
schoolboys and students from technical institutes with the required standards
of education. PJKA, however, does have difficulty in getting university



ANNEX 2
Page 2
graduates, particularly those with engineering qualifications (civil, mechanical
and electrical) because the initial pay and prospects with the railway are
not so good as in commerce, particularly in the oil industry.
3.        With regard to recru'tment at the lower levels, an unusual feature
is that Government regulations do not allow the employment of boys before
the age of 18. As many boys eligible for railway work leave school at ages
up to 15, there is an awkward gap to be filled at a formative age. It is
filled to some extent by technical institutes.
Exceptional Recruitment
4.        To meet exceptional requirements related to the ongoing pre-
mature retirement of staff, PJKA is making wide use of (a) advertisements;
(b) the Office of Manpower Placements; and (c) the Department of Education.
Special selection arrangements have been set up and extensive use is being
made of Indonesian Army facilities for selection and pre-service training.
B.   Technical Assistance Program
A summary of the estimated costs of technical assistance for the
period 1974/75-1976/77 is given on page 5 of this annex. The proposals are
summarized below:
(a) Mechanical workshops and depots - Teams of mechanical
specialists, versed in modern workshop practice and
production planning and control, to work in the shops
and depots to obtain the maximum benefit from the
improved facilities created by the investment. Proposed:
Estimated periods of assistance will be for two years;
the teams of specialists are to include one mechanical
engineer of wide experience, at headquarters; two
specialists, one senior and one junior, in each of the
major shops at Jogjakarta and Mangarrai; one senior
mechanical engineer at Surabaya; and one specialist
(junior mechanical engineer level) to work at each of
three depots in Java and Sumatra. Nominated counterparts
to be provided in all cases.
(b)  Track rehabilitation and maintenance - track engineers and
inspectors to be made available to work with the Inspeksi
and the Eksplotasi in the major task of setting standards and
ensuring sound rehabilitation and systematic track maintenance.
Proposed: Estimated periods of assistance will be three years.
One civil engineer of wide experience, at headquarters, and
three senior and six junior specialists for the three Eksplotasi
in Java, to work alongside qualified counterpart staff.



ANNEX 2
Page 3
(c) Statistics - there is a lack of adequate statistical and
financial data for management control and planning purpose.
Expert assistance is required to determine the statistics
needed and the most economical and effective methods of
securing their timely and accurate production. Proposed:
One railway statistics specialist posted at PJKA headquarters
for a period of one to two years to advise and help imple-
ment changes and to train his Indonesian counterpart(s).
(d) Accounting - there is a need to update and improve the
accounting system in general and in particular the
classification of accounts and expenses in order that a
better basis can be provided for managerial and cost control
and for traffic costing. Proposed: The assistance of a
firm of international public accountants to be obtained for
a period of about one year. Its task shall include training
and advising Indonesian counterpart staff.
(e) Traffic costing and tariff preparation - there is a need to
establish a routine - which the staff of PJKA can maintain
on a continuing basis - in the principles, processes and
techniques of traffic costing, to provide a basis for tariff
adjustments and investment evaluation. Proposed: One
financial specialist (senior) for a period of about two years,
and one specialist in tariff preparation for one year, employed
at headquarters. Counterpart training will also be undertaken
by the specialists.
(f) Operations - there is need for the progressive improvement
of train and wagon control, time-tabling and the preparation
of new manuals and regulations to cover operating practices
and for a study of the necessity for mixed train operations.
Proposed: One railway specialist with wide operational
experience, and one junior specialist, at headquarters to
work for a period of about two years in conjunction with
three specialists in movement control, one in each Eksplotasi
in Java.
(g) Stores - there is understocking of required spares and
materials on PJKA, resulting in a loss of operational capacity.
Financial constraints have contributed to this position,
but there is also need for the reorganization of stores pro-
cedures and methods of inventory control to ensure systematic
forecasts and budgeting of needs and the initiation and follow-
through of timely action. Proposed: One senior inventory
specialist at headquarters for a period of about one year.



ANNEX 2
Page 4
(h) Technical assistance and staff training - there is need
for an experienced railwayman to assist the Chief Director
in coordinating the technical assistance effort: he will
also oversee the expansion of training schemes.
(i) Planning - to assist the management in transportation
planning, investment analysis and project evaluation,
one specialist to be employed at headquarters for a period
of two years.
(j)  Overseas training - overseas training for selected PJKA
staff up to 800 man-months would be necessary. The training,
which will be in all fields of railway operations, will give
emphasis to those techniques and practices appropriate to
PJKA's system and technical requirements and to those
activities which are relevant to the implementation of the
recovery plan.
PJKA should assign sufficient qualified and experienced staff to
work on a full-time basis as the courterparts of the specialists referred
to above and thus permit PJKA to reap the full benefits of their assistance
and training.

Description of Railway Property
A.   Track and Structure
1.        Indonesian State Railways operate a system of 6,793 route-km (182 km
double track of which 55 km are electrified, on 1,500 volts DC) distributed
in the islands of Java, Madura and Sumatra. The network functions as six
geographically unconnected systems (Maps 10814 and 10815 distributed as
follows:
Location             Gauge (millimeters)       Route Length (km)
Java and Madura            1,067                    4,741
600                      93
South Sumatra              1,067                      644
North Sumatra              1,067                      542
West Sumatra               1,067                      263
Aceh                         750                      510
6,793
2.        The gauge is for the most part (6,190 km) 1,067 umn   Of the total
6,793 route-km, 4,552 km are main lines and 2,241 km are secondary feeder
lines. The most important lines are in the island of Java - 4,834 km of
which 2,792 km are main lines and 2,042 are feeder lines. About 20% of the
track of the whole system is laid with heavy rails (41 kg/m and 41.52 km/m),
29% with medium rails (33.4 kg/m and 38.0 kg/m) and the balance of 51% with
rails ranging from 25.7 kg/m to 30.22 kg/i.  The sleepers are mainly of
hardwood with some of pressed steel troughs; sleeper density is 1,450 per km
on the main line and 1,250 on the branch lines. About 20% of sleepers on the
main line and about 30/35% on branch lines are in poor condition. Ballast
is of crushed stone or gravel. Although the minimum depth of ballast under the
sleepers has been specified as 200 mm to 250 mm (8 in - 10 in) on the main
line and 150 mm (6 in) on the branch line, there is an acute shortage of
ballast except on a few sections of Java main lines. The ballast that exists
is mixed with soil and is caked up. The track fittings are old, mostly rigid
type; however, recently elastic and Pandrol types have been introduced. Due
to inadequate renewals, a large percentage of fastenings and some of the points
and crossings need replacement. The current permissible maximum speed on the
main lines in Java is 90 km/h but many speed restrictions exist due to the
poor condition of track. About 1,100 km of track has been welded (panels of
85 m length). PJKA has plans to weld an additional 700 km of track.



ANNEX 3
Page   2
3.        The ruling gradient on the main lines is 1 in 100 on the plains
and 1 in 50 in hilly terrain. The permissible axle loads on the main lines
of Java vary from 20 tons to 12 tons, but a large portion is fit for 15 tons
and over. The permissible axle load in South Sumatra is 13 tons and in North
Sumatra 11 tous. The maximum curvature is 8.75 degrees on the main lines
and 11.3 degrees on the branch lines.
4.        Maintenance of track leaves much to be desired.  This is due not
only to inadequate renewals of rails, fittings, sleepers and ballast but
to neglect of systematic maintenance over the past several years. There is
heavy creep, and track has sunk in long stretches on the north line and
on the Jakarta-Merak line in Java. Cleaning of ballast to ensure satisfac-
tory drainage of the track bed has not been undertaken as a regular measure
for ensuring good track maintenance. The maintenance of bridge structures
is satisfactory; however, a program of strengthening and replacement of old
bridges for higher standards has been undertaken. Other structures are
adequately maintained.
B.   Signalling and Telecommunications
5.        Most of the stations on the main lines with frequency of trains
of 12 or more per day are provided with signalling installations of Siemens
and Halske type. Other stations are provided with mechanical signalling
of differing older types. Out of the 396 stations in Java, 193 stations
have Siemens' system with 85 of them provided with section block. The other
203 stations have the older systems of signalling. In Sumatra, out of 147
stations (including 31 in West Sumatra) 24 stations have been provided with
Siemens installations with no section block; the balance have Alkmar (60
stations) and wood handle type (62 stations). For speeds of trains now
operating especially in Java, the signalling system urgently needs modern-
izing.
6.        The present telecommunication network of PJKA for administrative
control and for limited collection of wagon particulars, consists of a
radio network (HF-SSB) which links through a single side band the larger
offices like the headquarters, Eksplotasis (divisional offices) and the
Inspeksi (sub-divisions). The radio communication is possible only during
daytime because of limited frequency allocation by the communication council.
For other operational needs, the telecommunication system now depends on
Morse telegraph (types T, B, A) and telephones (also types T, B, A). For
train dispatch work, on most important sections such as Cikampek-Bandung
and Surabaya areas, additional sector telephones with selective calling
are used. Modern teleprinter equipment is functioning on southern Java
main lines. Recently a radio train dispatch system between Jakarta and
Cirebon has been brought into commission. A good telecommunication system
is essential for control of train operations, wagon distribution and move-
ment. PJKA have proposed a radio network connecting important centers
of railway activity in Java together with a satisfactory and adequate
system of train dispatch using a selector operated telephone system on
existing land lines. Such systems have been working satisfactorily on
several railways in Southeast Asia under conditions similar to those in
Indonesia.

C.   Workshops and Depots
7.        PJKA has 7 mechanical workshops (5 in Java and 2 in Sumatra)
for the overhaul, repair and maintenance of locomotives and rolling
stock. They are:
(Mangarrai   (Jakarta)    -  Passenger Cars (steel body)
(Surabaya                  -  Freight Cars
Java      (Jogjakarta                -  Diesel Locomotives
(Madiun                    -  Steam Locomotives
(Samarang                  -  Passenger Cars (wooden body)
Sumatra)
(South))     Lahat                      -  General - for all types of stock.
Sumatra)     Medan (Palubrayan)         -  General - for all types of work.
(North))
8.        All the workshops except the one at Jogjakarta are very old.
Many of the machines still have belt drive from counter-shafting.  Out of
1,600 items of serviceable machinery and equipment, 680 items are over 30
years old. The workshops are also deficient in adequate handling facilities
and tools and gauges.
Mangarrai Shop (near Jakarta)
9.        This workshop has to repair and maintain about 1,000 passenger
cars (steel body). The output in the past has been only about 250 coaches
per annum. This low output is partly due to lack of spare parts and partly
due to poor equipment. PJKA proposes to modernize the workshop to enable
it to increase output to about 500 passenger cars per annum. Production
planning, controls and methods also need to be greatly improved.
Surabaya Shop
10.       PJKA's workshop at Surabaya is a large unit handling the overhaul,
repair and maintenance of its freight car fleet in Java. It carried out
periodical and unscheduled repairs to about 2,600 freight cars in 1972.
The capacity needed is about 4,000 wagons p.a. By the addition of some items
of equipment like wheel set lathe, wheel set press, axle shaft lathe,
welding machines, forklift truck and overhead travelling cranes, and with
some technical assistance, it would be possible to improve the production
to required levels and reduce the repair time in this workshop.
Jogjakarta Shop
11.       This shop, which repairs and overhauls diesel locomotives, is by
far the best of PJKA's workshops. However, for improved production, not
only for the periodical overhaul of about 380 diesel locomotives but for
overtaking the huge backlog in rehabilitation of the large number of grounded
locomotives (69 in Java), this workshop needs additional machine tools and
modernization. During 1972 the outturn of periodical overhauls was only



ANNEX 3
Page 4
37 locomotives with a large number (255) of unscheduled repairs of the
locomotives. The practice of bringing locomotives to the shop for repairs
which normally are carried out in well organized depots in other countries
is wasteful. PJKA proposes to remedy this by adopting partial unit replace-
ment techniques and through better stocking of spare parts in depots. The
required out-turn from Jogjakarta whrkshops is about 80 periodical general
overhauls per annum, together with about 190 biannual intermediate overhauls.
Through the acquisition of some machine tools including a balancing machine,
a spring rolling machine, welding machine, grinding machine for collector,
a 2,500 hp hydraulic brake test equipment and a few fork lift trucks, PJKA
proposes to increase the production in this workshop to the required level.
Introduction of better production methods and progress planning, through
technical assistance, are essential to achieve this.
Madiun Shop
12.       This workshop carries out repairs and overhaul of steam locomotives
in Java. The holdings of steam locomotives of PJKA is expected to decrease
rapidly and the activity in this workshop will diminish according to the
pace of dieselization of motive power. The machinery and equipment in the
workshop are very old. Some serviceable items like lathes and milling and
other machines, together with part of the sheds, with modifications, will be
used in the scheme for the setting up of a permanent way rehabilitation
workshop.
Lahat and Medan (Palubrayan)
13.       These workshops in South and North Sumatra are general purposes
railway worlkshops handling the repairs, overhaul and maintenance of steam
and diesel locomotives, and freight and passenger cars. The equipment is
old; but except for minimal additions to equipment for the better maintenance
of diesel locomotives PJKA does not have plans for investments. The diesel
sections of these workshops can undertake normal overhaul operations of
diesel locomotives if adequate supplies of spare parts and major components
are made available from the parent workshop at Jogjakarta.
i3ridge Shop (Bandung)
14.       PJKA owns a bridge and structural fabricating workshop at Bandung
with a capacity of 1,000 tons of steel bridge girders per annum. The replace-
ment program of old and weak bridges and miscellaneous fabricated steel
structures of the railways needs the expansion of the existing facilities
to increase the production to 2,000 tons per annum.
Leo ts
15.       PJKA has 35 depots for locomotives and cars spread over the system.
Most of them, especially the diesel locomotive depots, are ill equipped and
do not have many necessary types of equipment like lifting jacks, tools and
gauges. This has resulted in throwing additional burden on the main diesel
workshop in Jogjakarta. PJKA proposes, in addition to stocking adequate
spares and components in the depots, to equip them with the necessary



ANNEX 3
Page 5
facilities for efficient day to day maintenance Of the locomotives. The
depots for passenger and freight cars will also be adequately equipped with
better tools and handling facilities and a stock of spare wheel sets to
ensure minimum detention to rolling stock in the depots.
D. Motive Power and Rolling Stock
16.       rhe details of the fleet of locomotives and rolling stock of PJKA
with their ages are given in Table 2. In brief, the holdings as of June 1973
were:

/f   73% if cars awaiting scrapping but still in partial service are
considered as in service.
Out of the total 570 steam locomotives 284 are in poor condition;
73 diesel locomotives out of a total of 311 diesel locomotives are out of
commission stabled in the workshops due to lack of spare parts and components.
Only four out of 10 diesel railcars are serviceable, also due to insufficient
spare parts. Out of 1,029 (excluding 1,468 awaiting scrapping) serviceable
passenger cars, 370 passenger cars are under or awaiting repairs. A large
number of passenger cars awaiting scrapping have wooden bodies; 1,436 cars
are over 40 years old.
17.       The freight car holding of PJKA is 24,660 in terms of four wheelers
(2 axle) of which 15,167 (in terms of,2 axle cars) are over 40 years old.
About 6,800 cars have been stabled in yards and sidings impeding mobility.



ANNEX 3
Page 6
Some of the old cars are used for carrying departmental traffic and for
commodities like stone, sand and other building material while moving short
distances. A systematic scrapping and disposal program of the old freight
cars is necessary to clear the yards and sidings.
E.   Marshalling Yards
18.       The main freight marshalling yards in Java are at Jakarta and
Surabaya. They each handle 700-750 cars per day. These two terminal yards
and the intermediate yards at Cikampek, Cireb,on, Samarang and Bandung have
adequate capacity for future traffic. Mobility in the yards will improve
when the stabled wagons are cleared away. The marshalling yards in north
and south Sumatra are adequate for the level of traffic expected for some
years to come.

APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECr
Traffic Trends and Forecasts
A.   Freight Traffic
1.        About 82% of PJKA's traffic (ton-km) is carried in Java and the
balance equally in North and South Sumatra. PJKA's revenue earnings, freight
traffic statistics for 1962 and from 1966 through 1972 are shown in Table 3.
From 1962 through 1966 freight traffic declined on the average by 7.5% p.a.
(compounded) in tons and 5.3% p.a. in ton-km. This decline was the result of
poor quality of railway service, increased competition from road transport
for short hauls, and reduced production of rubber, coffee and coal.
2.        Since 1967 the traffic has tended to increase due to the improved
economic climate and as a result of modest additions to rolling stock. From
1968 to 1972 freight traffic grew at the average rate of about 8.5% p.a. in
tons and about 9% p.a. in ton-km. This pattern of continuing growth in
freight traffic has been maintained during 1973 (7.9% in tons and 7.3% in
ton-km - Tables 4 and 5), increasing from 4.56 million tons to 4.92 million
tons, and in terms of ton-km from 1,038 million to 1,112 million. In Java,
the percentage increase during 1973 was even higher (10% in tons and 9.5%
in ton-km - Table 4). During the period 1966-72 the average haul of import-
ant commodities like kerosene, gasoline, cement, soya beans, timber and
miscellaneous goods declined from 210 km to 170 km. This was offset somewhat
by increases in the lengths of haul for rice and sugar.
3.        The traffic density on PJKA (964,400 traffic units per main line
route-km) is relatively low, even making allowance for the high percentage
of branch lines on the system. 1/ However, freight net ton-km per route-
kim improved from 126,680 in 1966 to 163,700 in 1973.
4.        A summary of the commodity-wise traffic for 1962 and 1972 shown
in Table 3 indicates some change in its composition during the period:
1/   Traffic unit = Ton-Km + Pass-Km - Main lines 4,550 km.

5.        The proportion of agricultural products, forestry products and
miscellaneous traffic was lower in 1972, while the share of petroleum and
oil products and building material increased. Short and medium haul traffic
in these categories was obviously diverted to other modes of transport.
The increased percentage of building material is largely accounted for by
short-lead traffic in sand and stone which is not attractive for road
trucks. For the period 1974 through 1979, the composition of rail traffic
is expected to remain basically unchanged except for a drop in the propor-
tion of traffic in oil and oil products (due to the construction of oil pipe
lines) and an increase in the proportion of agricultural and forestry products.
6.        The commodity-wise analysis of future traffic made by the con-
sultants (DECONSULT), taking into account the projected developments in
the industrial, agricultural and other fields, placed the rate of growth of
freight traffic for 1972 through 1979 at 6.25% p.a. in Java, 7% p.a. in
North Sumatra and 9% p.a. in South Sumatra. Table 6 shows mission's fore-
casts of PJKA's freight traffic from 1974 through 1979. These forecasts
are mainly based on the study by DECONSULT but have been adjusted downward
except for Java) in consultation with PJKA. For the whole of PJKA system
the average overall annual rate of growth for the period 1973 through 1979 will
be about 5.5% in tons, and in terms of ton-km slightly less (about 4.9%).
The rate of growth expected in the initial years will be lower (about 4.5%),
stabilizing at about 6.25% as the benefits of the Government's measures for
development in the fields of agriculture, forestry and industry are relized.

7.        The traffic is expected to increase in timber, fertilizers,
sugar, rice, building material and general goods, while there would be
a decrease in the traffic in kerosene, and gasoline (due to the projected
construction of pipelines). In Java, the increase in rice and sugar traffic
is the result of demand of long-haul transport expected for movement from
surplus regions of East and Central Java to Western Java and to the Port
of Surabaya for export. The rail movement of fertilizer in bulk from ports
to warehouses is likely to increase substantially. Freight traffic develop-
ment in Sumatra is expected to grow at a higher rate (7% p.a.) because of
the long hauls.
B.   Passenger Traffic
8.        About 90% of PJKA's passenger traffic (pass-km) is carried in
Java, with about 7.6% in South Sumatra, and the balance in North and West
Sumatra. Table 7 shows the PJKA's passenger traffic from 1962 through 1973. -/
During this decade the passenger traffic decreased, especially during the
years subsequent to 1966 when it declined at an average rate of about 8% p.a.
to 4.1 million passengers and 3,352 pass-km in 1972. Reasons for the decline
were: the growing competition from road transport including "civic missions"
by the military, the poor and unreliable service offered by the railways (due
to deterioration of track and rolling stock), reduction in operations on
branch lines, and the cancellation of some commuter services because of non-
availability of locomotives and passenger cars. During 1973 there was a
further sharp drop of about 28% in the number of passengers carried from
40.1 million to 28.8 million. This was the result of further deterioration
in train services, coupled with a substantial increase (about 30%) in basic
passenger fares introduced in May 1973. The increase in passenger fares
discouraged short-distance passenger traffic. Overall passenger revenue in
1973, however, increased.
9.        In forecasting the level of passenger traffic in 1979, DECONSULT
considered expected population and income growth, the trends of development
of higher-class traffic in Java and the general improvement in the quality
of service expected from rehabilitation of the main lines of PJKA. The
consultants concluded that passenger trips could grow at an annual rate of
3% over the 1972 level in Java and North Sumatra and at 5% in South Suatra,
with a higher rate of growth in terms of pass-km because of the anticipated
increase in the average length of Journey of the higher class passengers in
Java.
10.       In the light of the sharp drop in 1973 of passenger traffic,
the mission substantially modified estimates in consultation with
PJKA. Table 7 shows the forecast of PJKA Passenger Traffic for the period
1974-79. As against 40.1 million passengers and 3,352 million pass-km
1/ The traffic statistics do not include ticketless passengers and the
large number of passengers who travel on freight trains. DECONSULT
estimated that about 7.5% of passengers do not buy tickets.



ANMEX 4
Page 4
carried by PJKA in 1972, the forecast for 1979 is placed only slightly higher,
at 40.4 million passengers and 3,724 pass-km. Due to long neglect with
practically no repairs or improvements to its assets, the passenger services
on PJKA have progressively deteriorated. Even so, the railway in Indonesia
is a major carrier of long-distance passengers, and many of the services
are overcrowded. With the rehabilitation of track and passenger cars
ensuring more regular and speeded up passenger services and with better
control of ticketless traffic and elimination of unauthorized travel on
freight trains, it is reasonable to expect passenger traffic to recover,
especially for long distances.
11.       The mission considers that during the period 1974-79 passenger
traffic will grow from the low level of 1973 at an average rate of about
5.75% p.a.1/ However, for the first year, when the full besefit or rehabili-
tation would not be available, the growth will be smaller, at 3.75%.  It is
expected to stabilize at about 2% p.a. in 1979.
1/   During negotiations the Bank was advised of a recent Government decision
to use PJKA, for reasons of safety and orderly transportation, for
movement of all passengers under the Transmigration Program from East and
Central Java to Sumatra.

INDONESIA
APPRAISAL OF A RAILWAY PROJECT
Investment Plan 1974/75 through 1978/79 - Main Items
1.   Rehabilitation of North Line (Jakarta - Samarang - Surabaya)(7.5% of
Total Expenditure)
Based on a study carried out by Japanese consultants, the Government
had approved the re-laying of the entire route known as the North Line from
Jakarta to Surabaya (725 km) with R14A rails (42.18 kg). The track was to
be laid on wooden sleepers with additional ballast and made fit for speeds
up to 100 km/h. The bridges were also to be strengthened. Part of the
scheme, namely the Jakarta - Cirebon section (207 km), has recently been
completed. Of the balance of 518 km the plan provides for extending the
layihg of R14A rails and strengthening the bridges on 165 km which together
with 48 km of track strengthened a few year ago, will cover section Cirebon
- Samarang. This section carries more traffic than the section Samaraug -
Surabaya. The scheme for relaying of track beyond Samarang will be deferred,
but improved maintenance through lifting of track, provision of additional
ballast and replacement of worn fittings will be carried out as a measure
of safety for maximum permissible speeds of 80/90 km/hr.        -
2. Rehabilitation of Main Line Track Other than North Line (29.6% of Total
Expenditure)
Except for a few sections in Java, the track on main line in Java
and Sumatra is in very poor condition. Lack of funds, for replacement of
worn track material and for adequate maintenance during the past 25 years,
has caused progressive deterioration in its condition. Severe restrictions
limiting the maximum permissible speed to between 40 and 55 km/h have been
imposed over fairly long stretches on the main line in Java. In one stretch
of 20 km between Bandung and Kroja the speed has been limited to 20 kmn/h
because of the worn condition of the rails. The Plan provides for rehabilita-
tion of the following sections of the main lines in Java:
(a) Cirebon - JogJakarta - Surabaya,
(b) Bandung - Kroja,
(c) Jakarta - Merak,
(d) Kalisat - Banjuwanji, and
(e) Malang - Bitar.
As a mPAsure of ensuring safety in operation, replacement of
unserviceable sleepers, track fittings, and renewals of worn crossings and
switchings will be undertaken on other sections of main lines in Java and



ANNEX 5
Page 2
North and South Sumatra. Broadly, the Plan provides for renewal of about
102 km rails, 1.35 million sleepers, fastenings for 1,670 km of track
wherever defective or missing, 2.8 million m3 of ballast, 262 sets of
complete turnouts, and defective switches and crossings.  The improvement
of track drainage, repairs to bridge piers and welding of 650 km of tracks
also form part of the rehabilitation operations.
3.   Tools and Plant for Track Maintenance (1.9% of Total Expenditure)
The permanent way maintenance gangs are not fully equipped with
simple tools like track gauges, spirit levels, ballast rakes, track lifting
jacks, beaters, crow bars and track spanners. Besides equipping the gangs
with the full complement of tools required for systematic maintenance of
track, it is necessary that a track repair workshop at Madiun be set up and
equipped with adequate plant for carrying out repairs to points and casings,
cropping, strengthening and welding of rails and repairs to steel sleepers.
The necessary plant will include handling equipment including an overhead
travelling crane and a portal crane. In view of the large quantity of
ballast required for rehabilitating track on the main lines, production of
ballast by manual labor will be supplemented by production from two mechanical
crushers owned and worked by PJKA. The Plan provides for the procurement
of the tools and plant described and for the setting up of the track repair
workshop at Madiun, utilizing part of the facilities released from the steam
locomotive workshop.
4.   Rehabilitation and Improvement to Signalling (4.5% of Total Cost)
Except for the sections of Jakarta - Bogor, Cikampek - Bandung,
Surabaya - Malang and Jakarta area, where the train services are frequent,
the main lines of PJKA system are equipped with old and obsolete type of
signalling which need renewal. For the permissible speed of 80 - 90 km/h
it is necessary, not only for safety of operation but for improved train
working, that the standard of signalling be upgraded. The Plan provides for
installing Siemens-Helskie type with tokenless block instruments on the main
lines of Java and some sections of Sumatra. Eighty percent of this mechanical
block system can be manufactured locally with imported material like signal
wire, signal/point levers and shafts for lever frames, electrical plunger
locks and block instruments. Improved signalling will be provided for 157
stations on Java main lines and 33 stations in Sumatra.
5.   Improvement to Telecommunication and Train Dispatch System (2.6Z of the
Total Expenditure)
There is urgent need for better train and wagon control arrangements
throughout PJKA system and for better communications between the headquarters,
the "Ekplotasis", important railway yards, workshops and other centers of
activity. To achieve this, a UHF radio link with carrier frequency should
be set up; the general telephone networks at the headquarters and other
important stations should be improved and adequate teleprinter exchange
facilities, and a selector operated network on existing lines to serve a train
dispatch system installed. The Plan provides for a radio link connecting



ANNEX 5
Page 3
the important centers like Cirebon, Samarang, Surabaya, Cikampek, Bandung,
Surakarta, Jogjakarta and Madiun. (Jakarta, Cirebon and Baduang are already
on a radio link recently installed.)
7.        Improvements to the general telephone networks in Jakarta, Bandung,
Samarang, Surabaya, Jogjakarta and Madiun areas are required; also establish-
ment of a teleprinter network with, in Java, a single unit automatic tele-
printer exchange with capacity of 30 subscribers and voice frequency tele-
graphy equipment; for Sumatra subscriber equipment is required; all these
form part of the Plan. A train dispatch and control system with selector
operated network on existing line wires covering all the =ain lines of Java
is included in the Plan. Such train dispatch and control systems are found
to be adequate and are working satisfactorily in countries where conditions
are similar to those prevailing in Indonesia. The renewal of worn out
controller equipment on some of the sections like Cikampek - Bandung - Banjar,
Cirebon - Samarang - Surabaya, Samarang - Surakarta - Nadiun - Surabaya also
form an important part of the plan.
6.   Extension of Dieselization (12.2% of Total Expenditure)
(Rehabilitation and Procurement of Additional Diesel Locomotives)
PJKA's motive power consists of 570 ateam locomotives (including
182 shunting), 311 diesel locomotives (including 137 shunting), 11 electric
locomotives and 10 diesel rail cars. Because of heavy arrears of repairs
due to lack of spare parts (and the consequent resort to extensive cannibali-
zation) the availability of main line locomotives is extremely low - 60% steam,
59% diesel, 37Z electric and 40% rail cars). A total of 444 steam locomotives
are over 30 years old and 160 are over 40 years old; 94 steam locomotives
are earmarked for scrapping. During the Plan, old steam locAoetives will be
phased out, 59 diesel locomotives rehabilition, and 60 new diesel locomotives
acquired. All the main line services in Java will have been dieselized by
1979, resulting in the withdrawal from service of about 260 stem locomotives.
At the same time, the steam locomotive fleet of 200 in Sumatra will be reduced
by 130 locomotives (pages 7 and 8 of this Annex.)
7.   Rehabilitation of Existing Diesel Rail Cars and Acquisition of New Diesel
and Electric Rail Cars (2.6% of Total Cost)
PJKA own ten diesel powered rail cars. Due to lack of spares and
components, six of them are out of service. Rail car services are popular
and the plan provides not only for the rehabilitation of the old diesel cars,
but the procurement of 10 electric car sets of one power car and one trailer
each, and 12 diesel car sets of two cars each. The new rail cars will be
operated between Jakarta - Bogor (electric), Jakarta - Cirebon and Jakarta -
Merak (diesel). The old rehabilitated diesel rail cars will continue to work
in Jogjakarta region.
8.   Rehabilitation and Acquisition of Passenger Cars (6.6% of Total Cost)
PJKA have on their books, 2,184 bogie and 313 four wheeler
passenger cars (Table 2). Of these, about 1,000 cars, mainly of wooden



ANNEX 5
Page 4
body construction, are over 50 years old and 1,437 are over 40 years old;
361 cars procured in 1951/52 have been out of commission over a long period;
they are badly corroded.  The Plan provides for the scrapping of about 1,040
passenger cars (mainly wooden body) and the rehabilitation of 290 steel body
cars including equipping then with air brakes.
The'availability of passenger cars which at present is only 73%
(as compared with the generally accepted norm of 90%) will be improved to
90%.  When workshop facilities are modernized and spare parts are readily
available. The utilization of the fleet will also be improved when the large
number of mixed trains on the main lines is reduced and passenger services
are rationalized and run with greater efficiency as contemplated in the
Plan. On the basis of these improvements, page 10 of this Annex shows
the details of the requirement of passenger cars to the end of the Plan
period after allowing for the scrapping of unserviceable cars. It will be
seen that, besides rehabilitating 290 cars and diesel rail cars, the
procurement of 61 passenger cars (third class) and 22 sets of rail cars
(one power car and trailer each) is necessary. The required investment is
included in the Plan.
9.  Freight Cars (8.1% of Total Cost)
The total number of freight cars (2 lxle and 4 axle) an the books
of PJKA in 1973 was 22,279 (24,660 in terms of axle cars). (See Table 2.)
Of these 14,807 (15,167 in terms of 2 axle) are 40 years old or over. Old
wagons have not been taken off the books under a regular scrapping program,
but a large number (estimated presently at about 6,800) are stabled and not
actually in use. Including these, PJKA proposes to scrap 11,175 freight
cars (11,978 in terms of 2 axle cars - 9,000 by 1976/77). A further 1,000
wagons could be expected to be scrapped by 1979, retaining in service 10,104
cars (11,682 in terms of 2 axle cars). As a result of improvement to repair
facilities, the present bad repair ratio of 10% will be reduced to 5S. Better
wagon control and reduction in terminal and yard detentions will result in
better utilization of available freight cars. The average set train loads of
freight trains will be improved from the present 111.0 tons (Java) to 162
tons in 1979. Car-km per car day will be improved from 52.3 km (Java) to
56 km in 1979.  Car turnaround will be reduced from 8.3 days in 1973 to
7.3 days in 1979 (Java). On the basis of these improvements PJKA's
requirements of additional freight cars by 1979 will be 300 bogies (600 -
2 axle cars) including 120 ballast Hopper cars (see page 9 of this Amex).
In addition to the procurement of 300 bogie freight cars, the Plan provides
for the improvements to the freoight car fleet for achieving better freight
train operation. A total of 7,500 freight cars procured after 1957 will be
fitted with air brakes; of these 670 which now have hook couplers will be
equipped with automatic couplers (the rest are already so fitted).
10. Rehabilitation and Improvements to Workshops and Depots (3.2X of Total
Cost)
The equipment, tools Rnd handling facilities in the,three major
workshops in Java at Jogjakarta (for diesel locomotives) Mangarrai (for
passenger cars) and Surabaya (for freight cars) need urgent odernisation.



ANNEX 5
Page 5
These three workshops will in future handle all the repair work on locono-
tives and rolling stock of PJKA. The percentage of main line diesel
locomotives out of commission due to inadequate repair facilities compounded
by inadequate spares held in workshops and depot is 31%; a normal figure
would be 15%. Of the serviceable freight cars (excluding stock to be scrapped)
about 10% is under and awaiting repairs; a normal figure would be 4-5%.
The general availability of passenger cars (excluding those stabled for a
long time due to heavy corrosion needing extensive rehabilitation) is about
83%; a normal figure would be 90%. To improve the situation and to bring
down the bad repair ratio to normal levels, the Plan includes the replace-
ment of worn equipment and the procurement of some additional machine tools,
handling and testing equipment, welding sets and compressed air facilities.
The diesel depots which have inadequate facilities will be modernized by
the provision of lifting jacks, air compressors, cranes, testing equipment
and adequate tools. For expediting the repair operations in workshops and
depots, through until replacement, some major components like engines, trans-
mission, bogies and wheel sets will be stocked as part of the tools and
plant in the workshops and depots.
11. Bridae Workshop
The present workshop manufacturing steel bridges at Bandung is
capable of producing 1,000 tons of steel bridges per annum. The replacement
program of overaged steel bridges and miscellaneous fabricated steel
structures required by the railways, requires expanding the capacity of the
existing shop to 2,000 tons/annum. The Plan provides for the essential
expansion of the fabricating shop.
12.  Re-stocking of Inventories of Spare Parts for Locomotives, Freight and
Passenger Cars and Raw Materials (3.8% of Total Expenditure)
This item of the Plan covers the cost of normal stocks of spare
parts for locomotives, freight and passenger cars and raw material like steel
sections, spring steels, ferrous and non-ferrous metals, parts of train
lighting equipment, track material, and signalling equipment. Over the
years, PJKA's stock of such items has been badly depleted. Restocking of
the inventories is essential for ensuring reasonable standards of maintenance,
efficient functioning of the repair facilities and for better utilization
of existing assets.
13. Technical Training and Technical Assistance (5.2% of the Total Expenditure)
(See Annex 2)
The technical training facilities on the PJKA at Bandung and
Jogjakarta are inadequate and need not only expansion, but upgrading of the
standards. With the setting up of training facilities for mechanical staff
near the major workshops at Jogjakarta, Mangarrai (Jakarta) and Surabaya,
and for Sumatra at Palembang, the needs of workshops and depots will be
met. A staff college for management training for the higher cadres of
PJKA's staff and the provision of a specially equipped and manned train to



ANNEX 5
Pag   6
travel around the system to impart training on the job to peranent way
staff are included in the Plan. While the abowre will form part of the
permanent training schemes built into the organtization of PJKA to ensure
adequate training facilities not only to fresh recruits at the varioss levels
and different categories, but for refresher courses, there Is urgent need
for technical assistance from groups of expatriates from large railays,
working in the field alongside their Indonesian counterparts for lidited
periods ranging from two to three years. Because of the heavy leeway to
be made good in effecting improvements in planning and production control
in workshops, in introducing methods of systematic track maintenance, in
effecting improvements in train and wagon fovenent, in proper stocking of
stores and inventory control, in the compilation of statistics and costlng
and accounting methods, the quickest way to achieve the desired results
would be to assist the PJKA staff on the job in the day to day functioning
in these fields. This will ensure the most effective and expeditious means
of realizing the benefits expected from the investments proposed during the
Plan. Besides such assistance, there is need for the employment of procurement
consultants or agents who will assist PJKA in the expeditio. procurement of
goods and equipment required for the Project. Further, some "overseas" train-
ing for selected staff up to 800 man-months giving emphasis to those techniques
and practices appropriate to PJKA's system and technical requirements is
included in the Plan. A high level railway specialist at PJKA headquarters
working directly under the Chief Director, will coordinate the technical
assistance efforts.
Under technical training PJKA have proposed the setting up of a
laboratory for soil testing and soil mechanics. Adequate facilities exist
at the laboratories in Bina Marga Workshops (road wing) built and equipped
by USAID for soil testing and research. PJKA could make use of these
laboratories.

(c) Other Materials
The estimate for 1979/80 is based on the following assumptions:
The 1972 consumption of material was about 30% below the standard
necessary for efficient repair and maintenance.
Volume of output in 1979 will be 25% greater than in 1972.
Price inflation will be about 40%.
Hence: Expenditure 1979 will be:
1.30 x 1.25 x 1.40 x Rp 1,715 million (expenditure 1972)
Rp 3,900 million.

(b)  that rail passenger traffic demand will accord with the forecast to 1979/80 and increase thereafter at 3% p.a.;
(c)  that, in the absence of railway investment, the excess of demand over rail capacity will be diverted to road;
(d)  that in such case the rail cost per pass-km will increase from Rp 3.02 in 1973/74 to Rp 4.62 in 1980/81;
(e)  that road cost per pass-km, at standards of comfort, safety and service equivalent to rail, is Rp 4.50;
(f)  that a bus costs Rp 10 million; can carry the equivalent of 4 million pass-km p.a. and has a service life of 5 years of 500,000 km;
(g)  that if tle railway investment program is undertaken, the railway will have capacity up to 470 million pass-km; and
(h)  that, if the proposed investment program is undertaken, the railway cost per pass-km will decline from Rp 3.02 in 1973/74 to
Rp 2.12 in 1980/81.

Assumptions:  (a)  that without railway investment the railways' capacity to carry freight will decrease by 50% in the next 12 years;
(b)  that the demand for railway freight transport will accord with the forecast to 1979/80 and increase thereafter at 4% p.a.;
(c)  that, in the absence of railway investment, the excess of demandover railway capacity, will be diverted to road;
(d)  that, in such case, the rail cost per net ton-km will increase from Rp 9.40 in 1973/74 to Rp 12.20 in 1930/81;
(e)  that road costs per net ton-km are now Rp 12.00, but that with improved road standards and larger trucks are likely to fall to Rp 10.00
by 1980/81;
(f)  that, at constant prices, future investment in trucks and/or locomotives and freight cars will be as follows:
Capital cost                  Capacity                     Capital cost                   Estimated  life
