CHONGOING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A.    PROJECT BACKGROUND
With the national economic and social development of Chongqifg municipality, the municipal
people's government of Chongqing has fully realized the importance of increasing the ratio of
urbanization and speeding up the construction of urban infrastructure and improvement of the
environment. In order to spur the development of national economy in Chongqing in a sustainable
manner, increase the economic growth rate, improve the living environment of the people and
enlarge the extent to which the various groups of the whole society can benefit from the
improvement, the people's government of Chongqing municipality has selected a series of specific
environment improvement and infrastructure construction projects in a number of districts, cities
and counties within its territory and has input a huge amount of funds to them. In 2001, the
municipal government obtained a loan of US$200 million from the World Bank for urban
environment construction in a move to perfect Chongqing's infrastructure function and social
livelihood facilities in urban and rural townships and promote the urbanization process. For the
reasons of reduced number of subprojects and reduced volume of works, changes in the source of
funds and smaller amount of bidding funds than the investment budget, there will be a US$60 to 70
million saving of the World Bank loan and the municipal government has decided to continue.using
this saved sum of money for constructing environment facilities and infrastructure in Chongqing.
Chongqing Urban Environment Saving Loan Project consists of five environment improvement
projects and three water supply projects. They are: Comprehensive environment improvement of
Bachuan and Huaiyuan Rivers in Tongliang County; Comprehensive environment improvement of
Laixi River (Longshui section) in Dazu County; Comprehensive environment improvement of
Taohuaxi River (Longshui section) in Changshou District; Urban Water Supply Project in Bishan
County; Comprehensive Environment Improvement Project of Binan River in Bishan County;
Comprehensive Riverside Environment Improvement Project in Wulong County; Water supply
project in Shuangfu Township, Ji.angjin City and Water Supply Project in Dongyang Township,
Beibei District. The locations of these eight projects are as shown in Fig. 1.
The construction of these sewage treatment plants is helpful to mitigate the burden of pollution
caused by sewage, improve the ecological environment, and improve the residents' living
conditions and quality, while the construction of these water plants is helpful to solve the problem of
water supply for industrial production and domestic livelihood. The construction of these
comprehensive environment improvement projects is helpful to improve not only the flood-
containing capability of the riverbanks and protect the riverside area from flood, but also improve
the urban road transportation, urban natural environment and living environment as well as the
overall functions of the city. Generally speaking, these projects are helpful to beautify the city,
improve the environment for tourism and investment, spur the economic development in the
involved districts, counties and cities and quicken the urbanization process.
The construction of these projects will bring about direct benefit to 1.5 million people living in an
area of 1,329 square kilometers. The success of these projects will promote the sustainable
development of society and economy in the project area
These projects will be constructed in a period of 24 months from October 2004 to October 2006.

B.        IMPACTS OF THE PROJECTS
By land acquisition (or occupation) and house demolition, this project will permanently acquire land
of 1595.8mu, demolish house areas of 42514.2M2, affecting 46 villages in 8 rural townships of 7
counties (cities or districts) totaling 4,525 people in 1,146 households, of which 420 people in 122
households will be affected both by land acquisition and house demolition. As the land taken by the
urban environment projects is mostly shaped             in narrow   strips, the impact of land acquisition        is
limited with an average impact rate of 3% and the highest impact rate is only 32%. In addition,
according to the socioeconomic survey, the major income of the resettled people comes mainly
from non-agricultural sources. Therefore, land acquisition will not cause a major impact on the
resettled persons' income form agricultural production. See Table 1 for a list of affected population,
households, institutes, enterprises, and shops.

CHONGOING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
In addition, the people affected by these projects include 124 people of the vulnerable
group in 53 households, of which 36 are rural households and 17 are urban
households. The project package will affect 33 types of ground attachments and public
facilities.
C.     POLICIES ON RESETTLEMENT COMPENSATION
The policies applied to the resettlement for these projects are based on the Land Administration
Law of the PRC, Regulations on Land Administration in Provisions for Urban Residence Demolition
and Relocation in Chongqing Municipality (issued in Ordinance No. 53 by Chongqing Municipal
People's Government on March 1999) and Measures for Compensation for Land Acquisition in
Chongqing (issued in Ordinance No. 55 by Chongqing Municipal People's Government on
September 1999) laws and regulations promulgated by the  local district, county or city
governments and World Bank policies regarding involuntary resettlement.
The major policy principles are:
1) Measures are acquired to reduce the negative impact of resettlement to a minimum;
2) Compensation and resettlement plans made can improve the resettled persons' living
standards or at least restore them to the previous level;
3) The resettled persons are adequately consulted to give them chance to fully participate in the
making and implementation of the resettlement plan;
4) All the affected properties are compensated for at the replacement cost;
5) The displace persons are paid all the compensation for the losses before land acquisition and
house demolition.
The following polices are to be implemented:
(1) Compensation for permanent acquisition of land
When the rural collective-owned land is acquired, all the losses shall be reasonably compensated.
The compensation for acquiring farmland shall include the land compensation, resettlement
subsidy and compensation for ground attachments and crops. In the case of acquiring farmland,
land and resettlement compensation shall be paid at the rate of 10 to 30 times as much as the
average annual yield of the farmland in the past three years; in the case of acquiring garden land,
the land and resettlement compensation shall be paid at the rate of 1.2 times as much as the
compensation rate for farmland; in the case of acquiring ftshponds, the land and resettlement
compensation shall be paid at the rate of 1.3 times as much as the compensation rate for farmiand
in the case of acquiring non-farmland, the land compensation and resettlement subsidy shall be
paid at the rate of 1/2 of the rate of compensation for farmland; in the case of acquiring state-
owned riverside.shallow land, compensation is made for the crops on it only. In the case of
acquiring enterprise or institution's land, compensation shall be made at the evaluated land price.
See Table 4 for the rate of compensation for permanent acquisition of land.

(6) Policies regarding compensation for affected shops
The shop owners shall receive compensations for loss of land and houses at the replacement price
and at the same time receive facility compensation, financial subsides and resettlement allowances.
After receiving the monetary compensations, they may choose to purchase shops. Temporary
discontinuation of operation of shops during construction of the project shall also be compensated
for.
(7) Compensation for affected public facilities, ground attachments and sparse trees shall be made
at the replacement price.
(8) Illegal buildings and temporary structures not demolished in time shall be compensated for at
the replacement price for buildings.
D.     HOUSE REBUILDING PLAN
The house-rebuilding plan involves 66 urban households, 122 rural households, 18 enterprises and
institutions, and 38 shops.
(1) Rehabilitation of urban and rural residential houses
These projects will cause the demolition and relocation of 11,288.9m2 of urban residences,
affecting 330 persons in 66 households and 16,283.1m2 of rural residences, affecting 420 persons
in 122 households. After receiving the compensation at the replacement price, the affected persons
may choose to purchase cheap uniformly constructed resettlement apartments, new commercial
apartments or second-hand apartments. In addition, the rural residents may choose to build their
own houses.
Those who purchase cheap resettlement houses may buy such houses at the compensation price
and at the space standard of 18 m2 (17m2 in Tongliang County) per person. For limitation of
design, the excessive space is to be purchased at a rate 50% as much as the construction cost if it
is not more than 5m2 and if the space is in excess of 5m2 but less than the space of the
demolished house, it may be purchased at the combination price (construction cost plus land price).
Any part exceeding the space of the demolished house is to be purchased at the market price of a
commercial house. The demolisher shall construct facilities such as water and ground leveling in
the resettlement area; water and power supplies shall be constructed in the resettled houses.
Those who choose monetary compensation and purchase commercial houses in the affected
localities may be exempted from the tax derived from the 18m2 (17m2 in Tongliang County) per
person space standard. For those who cannot afford to buy commercial apartments, resettlement
houses or second-hand houses, the local government shall provide cheap rent houses after they
have received the compensation.
Rural residents who choose to build their own houses by themselves shall be provided with sites
free of charge by the local government at the average per-capita space standard. They shall build
such houses according to the plan made by the village or township.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
Facilities such as water, power and gas supplies, transportation, communications and cable TV
systems shall be constructed in the resettlement areas and commercial residential centers.
Schools, post offices, banks, food markets, bus stops, hospitals and other facilities shall be
constructed around the residential area to convenience the residents. The resettled persons may
choose to buy apartments of different grades in the residential area at their own will. These houses
are much better than their former houses (most of which were built in the 1970s to 1 980s) in quality,
structure, environment and accessibility. The second-hand houses are mostly old houses left by
the enterprises and institutions and are also better than their former houses in location, quality and
structure. Part of the vulnerable group suffering domestic poverty shall be provided with cheap-rent
houses by the government.
(2) Affected enterprises
These projects will affect 15 enterprises, of which two are no longer in production, one operates
seasonally and one is not running well. Three enterprises are affected by land acquisition only, six
are to be completely relocated and the rest are to be partly demolished. Enterprises whose land is
acquired will receive land compensation at the estimated land price, while those to be completely
relocated may, after receiving the compensation for construction land and buildings, choose to
move into the local industrial parks or planned new urban areas. As the transportation,
supplementary facilities and environment are uniformly planned, such enterprises will have better
operating conditions than before. The'income loss of the employees of such enterprises during the
transition period will be compensated for. Enterprises to be partly demolished may choose to
rebuild their houses or use the compensation for other purposes.
(3) Affected institutions
The proposed projects will affect three institutions including two whose old offices are to be
demolished. These two institutions have new offices and will receive house compensation. The
Shuren College partly demolished will rebuild backwards.
(4) Affected shops
The projects will affect 38 shops of which 36 are to be completely demolished and relocated and 34
of them are located in Dazu County. These shops are all on the ground floor of the building of
which the second floor serves as the domestic living area. Two shops in Wulong County will not be
demolished and only their operation will be temporarily affected during construction of the project.
The 36 affected shops are all run by the families and these families will receive compensation at
the displacement price with which they can purchase shops of a similar floor space and structure in
similar locations. The shop owners may choose to purchase shops to continue operation or use the
compensation for other investments.
The two affected shops in Wulong County are operated on rent. The tenants can be resettled in
two ways: in the first place, the demolisher provides the tenants houses that can be rented as
shops including shops of similar location and rent rate and helps them look for and arrange new
production houses. The tenants shall receive a movement allowance at the rate of RMB15/m2. The
owners of both shops shall receive compensation for loss of rent. In the second place, the tenants
shall be compensated for loss of income (including wages) due to discontinuation of operation
during the period of temporary impact and the owners of the two shops shall be paid a
compensation for loss of rent at the rate of RMB20,000 per year, which can be calculated
according to the actual duration of impact.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
REsETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
E.    INCOME REHABILITATION PLAN
The socioeconomic survey shows that, for the affected farmers, the income from land accounts for
13-40% of their total income and the majority of income comes from non-agricultural activities,
accounting for more than 60%. Wages earned by working as migrant laborers in the city constitute
the major source of non-agricultural income, accounting for more than 43% of the total amount. As
the urban environment projects are mostly built on narrow strips of land, most of the farmers will
not have their land completely acquired. The average rate of impact caused by land acquisition is
3% and the highest rate of impact is 32%. Therefore, land acquisition will bring about no major
impact on the income of the affected persons. See Table 7 for detail.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
Farmers whose land is permanently acquired shall be reasonably compensated at the rate of
RMB21,450-45,000/mu. The affected persons may choose from the following three alternatives for
production resettlement:
1) Reallocation of farmland, by which the farmland is reallocated among the villages and the land
compensation and resettlement subsidy received after reallocation are divided equally among
villagers. Dazu County will adopt the method.
2) Monetary compensation: by which farmers in villages where the per-capita space of farmland
after land acquisition is more than 0.5 mu are resettled by monetary compensation, that is, the
land compensation and resettlement subsidy are paid to the affected persons depending on the
space of land acquisition.
3) Change of status by which farmers in villages where the per-capita space of farmland is less
than 0.5mu are resettled by having their status as agricultural population changed into non-
agricultural population. These people will thus receive a sum of RMB16,000 as land
compensation and resettlement subsidy. After the number of status-changed persons is
decided, the farmland given up by them may be reallocated among villagers remaining in the
village depending on their willingness.
The status-changed farmers affected by land acquisition may be resettled by monetary
compensation, insurance, social security support, etc.
1) Monetary compensation, by which the land compensation and resettlement subsidy are paid to
the status-changed persons to allow them to make a living;
2) Resettlement by basic social endowment insurance, by which those who are above 16 years of
age but have not yet reached the age of retirement specified by the state government may, by
presenting their urban resident register and ID card, apply for the, basic endowment insurance
for urban workers at the local social insurance agency. Those who have secured this type of
insurance and have actually paid the premium for 15 years and longer may receive endowment
insurance money on a monthly basis after they have reached the age of 60 years for men and
55 years for women.
3) Resettlement by social security support, by which those status-changed persons may apply for
the minimum urban resident subsistence-allowance if the average income of them and their
family members living together is lower than the minimum local subsistence level of urban
residents. The level of the allowance is determined according to the cost of clothing, food and
shelter necessary to maintain a decent life for a local urban resident and in consideration of the
cost of water and fuel (coal or gas) and compulsory schooling of their young children. The
standard of urban minimum subsistence allowance in the affected localities are respectively:
RMB185/person/month in Beibei District, RMB145/month in Jiangjin County, Changshou
District, Tongliang County and Bishan County, RMB115/person/month in Wulong County and
RMB130/person/month in Dazu County.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
For those farmers losing farmland, the local government will establish a complete labor service
system to provide assistance to them. The relevant labor service agency for the affected people will
be founded one month before land acquisition to help the resettled person get employed through all
possible channels. Such help includes, for example, giving the status-changed persons free access
to the job market, collecting job information from the local sources and providing it to the resettled
persons one month before land acquisition and then publishing such information once a month
afterwards, providing free vocational training to the status-changed persons (Such training is
mainly oriented to the demand of the local job market. For instance, in Dazu County, the training is
oriented to the acquisition of metalworking skills, and in Bishan County, it is oriented to the
acquisition of shoe-making skills, etc.). The labor service agency will also consult the enterprises
being constructed or seeking expansion and provide them with certain preferential incentive
policies (such as being exempted from part of tax if they employ the status-changed persons) in
order to make it easier for these persons to get employed.
F.     REHABILITATION OF VULNERABLE GROUPS
The vulnerable groups refer to those groups of people most easily harmed by these projects as
well as those to whom the environment in which they live makes them unable to adjust themselves
to the changes brought about by the construction of these projects. The vulnerable groups include
mainly impoverished families, families consisting of handicapped persons, families consisting
mainly of women, families consisting of alone-living old people (single and aged more than 65
years and having no legal supporters) and families of ethnic minority people.
The projects will affect 124 persons in 53 families of the vulnerable group including 75 people in 15
impoverished families, 18 people in 18 families having handicapped members, 13 people in 7
families consisting mainly of women, and 18 people in 13 families consisting of old people living
alone, and will affect no families of ethnic minority people.
Except the policies described above, the vulnerable groups shall enjoy the following preferential
policies.
(1) The land compensation and resettlement subsidy may be paid, at their will, to the county public
welfare bureau or county (village) rest house or their children who will take care of them in the rest
of their lives.
(2) Those vulnerable groups affected by house demolition and having difficulty getting adequately
sheltered shall be provided with assistance according to the situation such as by providing cheap-
rent houses, offering vocational training to the laborers in their families and providing them with job
information and guidance to increase their chance of getting employed.
(3) For those vulnerable groups who choose to build their owr houses, the demolisher shall assist
them in building the houses and offer free agricultural technical training to their children and help
them develop agricultural production to increase their income from farming.
(4) Land shall be restored first for those vulnerable groups affected by land occupation.
(5) During construction of the project, prior consideration shall be given to employing the children of
the vulnerable groups to do jobs requiring no special skill.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
G.     BUDGET AND IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
The total resettlement budget for constructing the projects is RMB103 million, including RMB38.862
million in making compensation for permanent acquisition of land, accounting for 38%, RMB9.817
million in making compensation for demolishing urban and rural residential houses, accounting for
10%, RMB16.993 million in making compensation for the affected enterprises and institutions,
accounting for 17%, RMB3.512 million in making compensation for the affected shops, accounting
for 3% of the total budget. The total resettlement expense will be included in the cost of the whole
project package. The major source of fund includes the developer own fund and loans of the local
govemments. The budget for each individual project is as shown in Table 8.
The compensation for land acquisition and house demolition is paid to the resettlement agency by
the project owner. The resettlement agency then pays the land compensation and resettlement
subsidy to the affected villages or households. The crop compensation is paid directly to the
affected households. The village leadership divides the land compensation and resettlement
subsidy in different ways. The house compensation is paid to the owner of the house by the
resettlement implementation agency in installments as stipulated in the house demolition and
relocation contract, the compensation for affected enterprises, institutions and shops is paid directly
to their owners, and the compensation for infrastructure, ground attachment and sparse trees
directly to its owner. Those copies of compensation contracts and payment receipts must be kept in
the project owner and county PMOs at the same time. The fund circulation process chart is as
shown in below.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
The owner of each project in the respective districts, cities and counties is the executive agency for
constructing the project and shall, in resettlement activities, designate special-duty personnel to
supervise and manage the process. Its major responsibility includes authorizing the designer to
prepare the resettlement action plan, participating in resettlement surveys, confirming the
resettlement action plan, consigning or organizing resettlement action, supervising and managing
the resettlement implementation, paying money, reporting the progress of resettlement to the
district, city or county PMOs and furnishing internal monitoring reports.
The resettlement-executing agency performs the resettlement work in two ways: firstly, the owner
entrusts the resettlement work to the district, city or county land administration bureau and
demolisher; secondly, the owners carry out the resettlement plan by themselves. Of the eight loan
saving projects, seven's are to be carried out using the first option. The resettlement executing
agency in Dazu County is project owner itself. See Table 9 for detail.
The urban or rural township resettlement work group, village committee and villager group
participate in the project survey and assist in the preparation of the Resettlement Action Plan, take
part in the engineering survey, organize public participation, publicize policies regarding
resettlement, carry out, insect, monitor and record the resettlement activities within the township,

Founded in 1993, Chongqing PMO is highly experienced in managing and implementing WB-
assisted projects. However it is the first time for the WB-assisted project offices of the affected
districts, cities and counties to handle such projects and they lack experience in resettlement
implementation and management. To ensure the smooth implementation of this resettlement action
plan, municipal office will strengthen organizational capability in the following aspects:
1) Staff reinforcement: the organization at each level will be made up of specialized technical
personnel and managerial personnel who must be adequately qualified in technology and
management;

2) Intensified training: since March 2003, experts have been invited several times to train major
staff members of each organization on such subjects as World Bank's operation policy (OP4.12)
regarding involuntary resettlement, laws and regulations on land acquisition and house
demolition, conduction of socioeconomic surveys, and production and livelihood rehabilitation
for resettled persons and further training will be provided for workers involved in the work on
land acquisition and resettlement for constructing the proposed projects, including resettlement
polices, implementation and management of resettlement, resettlement monitoring and
evaluation, etc.;
3) Providing sufficient support in finance and equipment to improve work efficiency;
4) Strengthening the reporting system and intensifying internal supervision and monitoring to
solve any problem found;
5) Establishing an external supervision and evaluation mechanism and an early warning system.
PUBLIC CONSULTATION AND DISCLOSURE
In compliance with the resettlement policies, laws and regulations issued by the central
government, Chongqing municipal government and local governments of districts, cities and
counties involved, in order to protect the legal rights and interests of the resettled persons and
entities, and minimize dissatisfactions and disputes, great importance will be attached to the
participation of the resettled people in the whole process of policy making and plan development
and implementation to widely hear their suggestions and views.
While the settlement plan is being prepared, the plan maker, project owner, each district, city or
county project office, land administration bureau, resettlement office, township government and
village committee has held several discussions with the affected persons before fixing the
compensation rates and resettlement alternatives.
Before the project is executed, the resettlement office will distribute the resettlement booklets
among the affected villages. The affected residents will then obtain the booklets from the
residential committee, village committee, which contains detail on project profile, project impacts,
polices on compensation, project executing institution, channel to lodge complaints and grievances,
etc.
Up to August 2004, the reseKtlement plan reviewed and approved by the World Bank have been
placed in each district, city or county resettlement office and library and public notices issued on
major local newspapers or cable TV so that the affected persons can get a full understanding of the
reseKtlement plan and be aware of their own rights.

upon receiving the arbitration result, bring a lawsuit to a civil law court in case of objection to any
aspect of the resettlement plan.
K.     MONITORING AND EVALUATING
According to the World Bank's guide for monitoring and evaluating, an internal and external
monitoring mechanism will be established during planning and implementing the proposed
environment projects in Chongqing. Internal monitoring will be carried out by the municipality and
each district, city or county PMOs, while extemal monitoring by an independent supervision and
evaluation agency chosen by competitive.bidding. The supervision and evaluation group shall be
made up of highly experienced resettlement and socioeconomic experts.
The subject for internal monitoring includes mainly: progress of resettlement, compensation for and
rebuilding of resettlement houses, space of land acquisition, compensation for land acquisition,
labor force resettlement, rehabilitation and reconstruction of infrastructure, allocation and use of
resettlement funds, handling of complaints and grievances, staffing of each resettlement agency
and personnel training, working schedule, function performance and efficiency of each resettlement
agency, etc.
The emphasis of external supervision and evaluation is placed on the rehabilitation of production
and living standards of the affected persons, which includes:
1) Monitoring of typical resettled resident households (10%): payment of urban resident
compensation fund, availability of resettlement houses, and income rehabilitation; availability
of house sites for resettlement of rural residents, progress of house construction, payment of
compensation fund, quality of houses constructed, etc.;
2) Monitoring of typical shops (20%): payment of shop compensation fund, availability of
resettlement houses, progress of relocation, rehabilitation of production, and rehabilitation of
employees' income;
3) Monitoring of enterprises and institutions (20%): payment of compensation fund, land
acquisition for new sites, houses construction, progress of relocation, production rehabilitation,
rehabilitation of employees' income.
In addition, it is necessary to monitor resettlement progress, compensation rates and allocation of
fund, capability of executing agencies, depth and effect of public participation by resettled persons,
operation and efficiency of mechanisms handling complaints and grievances, etc.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGOING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
Each district, city or county PMOs will prepare one internal monitoring report every three months
and submit it to Chongqing PMO, which will prepare a year-end summary statement to be
submitted to the World Bank. The independent external monitoring agency will produce one
monitoring report every half a year. The basic survey will be conducted in December 2004 and the
first issue of the monitoring report will be produced in August 2005 and the second issue in
February 2006. Monitoring and assessment reports (Issue 3 to Issue 5) will be submitted from
August 2006 to August 2007.
After the project is completed, post evaluation will be conducted on the basis of monitoring and
evaluation already made and using the relevant theory and method to evaluate the successful
experience and lessons to be learnt in the resettlement of residents, shops, enterprises and
institutions and provide experience usable to later resettlement activities for constructing small city
projects in Chongqing.
L.     REVIEW ON THE IMPLEMENTED RESETTLEMENT OF CUEP
Chongqing Urban Environment Project (CUEP) consists of five components, namely, Chongqing
Urban Waste Water Component, Chongqing Urban Solid Waste Component, Fuling Waste Water
Component, Shizhu Water Supply Component and Wanzhou Water Supply Component. The two
components of Shizhu and Wanzhou did not acquire land and demolish houses and thus no
resettlement involved.
According to the RAP confirmed by WB, totally this project would permanently acquire land of
3550.84mu, demolish house areas of 247184.95M2, affecting 13418 people in 3193 households.
The total budget is RMB762 million. See table 10 for details.

On the basis of the project progress schedule, the resettlement began to implement in 2001 and
planned to fulfil in 2004. By the end of 2003, the completed land acquired was 2705mu, 76% of the
planned; house demolition area was 245000M2, 91% of the planned: resettlement fund paid was
about RMB540 million, 710% of the planned.

CHONGOING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
As a joint team, Southwest Transportation University and Chongqing Social Science Institute is
independent monitoring agencies of the project. Up to now, five monitoring reports have been
submitted. These reports revealed that: the project construction has been in smooth progress;
owners and executing agencies of local governments paid compensation in time without delaying,
skimping and embezzling the resettlement fund; the planning, construction, environment of
resettlement sites and house structure are fully consulted with APs, and the income and housing
condition of the APs are a bit better than before; and the resettled are satisfied with the relocation.
At the same time, these reports also put forward that on the resettlement sites of Jiguanshi and
Tangiatuo farming markets were not built up and allocated in time to the APs based on the
resettlement plan. Chongqing municipal government and CPMO have already paid more attention
to the problems, and made a commitment to solve the resettlement problems according to the
action plan agreed by WB,
During the implementation of saving loan project, to draw lessons from the ongoing CUEP is very
necessary. Besides establishing the resettlement external independent monitoring institute, PMOs
should establish resettlement internal monitoring mechanism; reseKtlement implementation
agencies should participate in the RAP preparation, and understand the WB involuntary
resettlement policies. They should implement the resettlement in the light of RAP confirmed by WB,
and periodically submit reseKtlement internal monitoring reports to project owners and PMOs.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
OBJECTIVE OF THIS RAP AND DEFINITION OF RESETTLEMENT TERMINOLOGY
This Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is prepared according to the relevant national and local laws
and regulations effective in the People's Republic of China and the clauses in OP4.12: "Involuntary
Resettlement" of World Bank Operation Guidelines. The purpose of preparing the document is "to
provide the affected people with such a resettlement and rehabilitation plan so as to ensure they
benefit from the project and have their living standards improved or at least restored to the pre-
displacement level after the project is completed."
The term "affected people" is defined as follows:
"Affected people" refers to those people whose standard of living is being or will be adversely
affected due to the implementation of the project or affected by the temporary or permanent
acquisition of their ownerships, rights or interests to any houses, lands (including house sites,
farmlands and pastures) or other movables or immovable or the negative effect on their businesses,
takings and jobs or inhabitations and habits.
'Affected people" may either be individuals or legal persons such as enterprises and public
institutions. The definition of "affected people" does not limit the permission of their legal
registration and livelihood or businesses being carried out within the affected area nor limit the
compensation for the damage of their properties and includes the following:
(1) All the people regardless of their legal rights and interests or whether they are present when
their properties are acquired and
(2) People not given permission to reside in a particular area.
Therefore, all these people will be considered and recorded as affected people regardless of their
properties, lands or locations.
If the acquired lands or properties of more than one person or household are to be used or
compensated for, compensation and rehabilitation will be made depending on the damage and
impact received on their rights and living standards. The definition of affected people has a direct
relationship with the adverse impact of the project regardless of their legal rights and interests.
The term "compensation" is defined as follows:
Compensations should be made to all the people affected by the project to improve or at least
restore their living standards and for the damages caused to their properties. The compensation for
damages of properties will be made at the price as if there are bought new and not at a reduced or
discounted price based on depreciation or other reasons. All the affected people should be given
the rights and interests derived from the impacts they receive, and, except for being given the
compensation for the property damage, they should also be subsidized for rehabilitation. Those
who are affected by the project but have no properties, rights and legal permission for residence
and are engaged in businesses, land cultivation or building construction without should be treated
as equal to those who have properties, rights and legal permission for residence and are qualified
to have their livelihood restored and property damages compensated for.
The term "resettlement" is defined as follows:
"Resettlement' refers to the arrangement made for people affected by the project in production or
livelihood activities so that they can benefit from the project. This mainly involves the following:
(1) Movement of shelters;
(2) Seeking reemployment for the affected people;

(3) Making rehabilitation of (or compensation for) the loss of lands, work places, trees and
infrastructures;
(4) Restituting welfare for those whose living standards (or quality) is adversely affected (such as
harmed by polluting gases) due to land acquisition and resettlement;
(5) Restoring or compensating for the affected private or public enterprises; and
(6) Restoring cultural or public properties adversely affected.
The term "rehabilitation" is defined as follows:
'Rehabilitation" means to bring back the capability of the affected people to continue their
production activities or improve their living standard or at least maintain it at the level before the
project is constructed.
The ultimate purpose of this "Resettlement Action Plan' is to enable those affected by the project to
have their damages compensated so that their living standard is improved or kept at the level
before the project is constructed. To achieve this purpose, the plan outlines rehabilitation measures
so that the affected people can regain their income to enable them to live on. Meanwhile, the
affected business and production resources (including shops and enterprises), public properties,
infrastructures and cultural relics will also be improved or at least restored to the level before the
project is constructed.

CHONGOING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
Since approval of the loan ($200 million) it has become apparent that there will be significant
savings from the loan (estimated at approximately $60 to $70 million), which may be re-allocated
for existing and/or new project components. The basis for this estimate is the trend in procurement
activities, namely:
(a) Bid prices of already awarded contracts average between 50 percent and 60 percent of the
estimated prQject costs indicated in the Project Appraisal Document;
(b) Reductions in the scope of works,
(c) Cost reductions arising from refined detailed engineering design, and
(d) Loan savings due to works being completed along with ongoing bund road works, ahead of
schedule using Chongqing's own funds.
1.2 THE CHONGQING URBANISATION & ENVIRONMENT PROJECT (CUEP Il)
As of November 2002, Chongqing Municipality began to enter in a dialogue with the World Bank
concerning a second possible loan to finance both urban and environmental projects in Chongqing.
As initially outlined the project focussed on four broad sectors:
* Infrastructure construction to support the development of business parks;
* Water Supply;
* Bund Roads (including fiood control/protection);
* River Harness (Wastewater and Flood Control/Protection).
A list of the projects initially presented for financing by the World Bank is presented in TABLE 1-1
below.
As the preparation of a number of the below projects was relatively well advanced, it has been
proposed that these projects cowld be possibly financed using the loan savings from the first urban
environment project in Chongqing, the CUEP.

1.7 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE IMPACT CAUSED BY THE PROJECT
During the periods of planning, designing, construction and resident resettlement, the designer and
project owner have acquired some effective measures to minimize the impact of the project on the
local society and economy of the project area.
1.7.1 PROJECT PLANNING AND DESIGNING PERIOD
Optimise the design to avoid as much as possible densely populated areas or multi-story or high
buildings as an effort to minimize the area of land acquisition and house demolition and
resettlement and the number of non-voluntary resettlement of residents.
When designing the sewage treatment plants and water supply plants, a number of site alternatives
are provided to find out the one involving the least demolition and resettlement of houses.
When planning green belts and pedestrian passageways, their widths have been determined
section by section according to the actual situation to avoid as much as possible demolishing and
relocating permanent buildings within the project area.
When planning the pressurizing pump stations, due considerations have been given to the
technical requirement for water supply pipeline route and the actual topographical conditions along
the route and the sites chosen are far from the residential area. This not only makes it easier to lay
out the pipeline but also minimizes the impact of the project on the domestic life and production
activities of the local residents.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
The water delivery and distribution pipelines will be laid along the highway route or follow the
existing pipeline route to minimize land acquisition and house demolition and avoid affecting the
local residents' domestic life and production. In addition, under the condition of ensuring safe
supply of water, single pipeline will be adopted to minimize the space needed for construction and
transportation. In places along the highway route where there are residential houses and it is
impossible to lay pipes, a bypass route will be followed to void resettlement of residents.
1.7.2 CONSTRUCTION PERIOD
At the construction period, special efforts such as improving the construction techniques,
strengthening the management and separate operation and separate rehabilitation will be made to
minimize the impact on the local people caused by land acquisition and construction operations
and at the same time make it convenient for the affected people to proceed with their work and
daily lives.
Temporary occupation of land will be minimized or avoided and exploitation of local materials for
construction will be avoided. Materials will be purchased from the market. All the temporary
buildings for construction will be arranged in the range of acquired land to avoid additional
occupation of land. Though temporary excavation and occupation are unavoidable in pipeline
construction, positive measures will be taken to minimize the impact.
The construction period and the time of land occupation will be shortened as much as possible to
minimize the impact on the shop business of the affected farmers.
Rehabilitation of demolished facilities will be planned and arranged in advance. In actual practice,
the local conditions will be made the best use of to ensure safety, effectiveness, promptness and
accuracy and minimize the adverse effect on the people living nearby.
If technically feasible, priority will be given to using local transport facilities and labour services so
that the affected local people can benefit from the project.
1.7.3 LAND ACQUISITION AND RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN AND ITS
IMPLEMENTATION PERIOD
When land acquisition and resettlement of people are inevitable, the following measures will be
acquired to minimize the impact on the local people.
Ensure that every affected group of people get the compensation for all their damages at a price as
if the property were purchased new and that they are properly resettled and restored to share the
benefit brought about by the project.
On the basis of the socio-economic survey and further analysis of the local situation, a reasonable
and practicable resettlement plan should be prepared to minimise the projects impacts of house
demolition and land acquisition and ensure resettled persons' income rehabilitation.
Make detailed plans to safeguard the interests of the resettled persons, announce the policies and
practices about compensation in time, accept openly the claims of the resettled persons and the
resettlement office will solve any problem occurring through consultation with the resettled local
people to ensure they receive no or the least impact on their domestic lives.
Encourage public participation and accept the monitoring of the masses

3 SOCIO-ECONOMIC SURVEY OF PEOPLE AND UNITS AFFECTED
To further understand the socio-economic situation of the affected area and obtain
fundamental facts about the affected people, the project office in compliance with the
requirement of the World Bank carried out a preliminary survey of the socio-
economic situation of the affected area in April 2003 to provide data for analysis. In
September 2003, the project office, while continuing investigations into the quantity
of tangible work, conducted a sample survey of the socio-economic situations of the
affected families, enterprises, institutions and shops. The survey took the form of
questionnaires and interviews and involved 1,848 rural residents (accounting for
40% of the total affected population), 270 urban residents (accounting for 38% of the
affected population), 18 enterprises and institutions (accounting for 100% of the total
number) and 38 shops (accounting for 100% of the total number).
3.1 FUNDAMENTAL FACTS ABOUT THE AFFECTED NATURAL VILLAGES
The permanent land acquisition for the project will affect 36 villages in 8 townships of

Note:   Tongliang County's fish-breeding centres are located in the rural area and will be compensated for at the
standard for farmland. The houses will also be compensated for at the standard for farmhouses. As the affected
enterprises of other counties or districts are all located in the urban area, they will be compensated for at the
urban land price and house compensation.

Note:    Most of the shops in Tongliang County are run in the ship-owners' own residences and located in the out-of-
the-way intersection of urban and suburban areas while the shops in Dazu County are mostly located in the
urban area. Therefore the standards of compensation in the two counties differ considerably from each other.
The shops in Wulong County are most affected temporarily and will be moved elsewhere for operation.

CHONGOING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGOING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
6   PRODUCTION AND LIVELIHOOD REHABILITATION PLAN
6.1 RESETTLEMENT PLAN
6.1.1 REHABILITATION OF PERMANENTLY LAND ACQUISITION
Farmers whose land is permanently acquired shall be reasonably compensated at the rate of
RMB21,450-45,000/mu. The affected persons may choose from the following three alternatives for
production resettlement:
1) Reallocation of farmland, by which the farmland is reallocated among the villages and the
land compensation and resettlement subsidy received after reallocation are divided
equally among villagers. Dazu County will adopt the method.
2) Monetary compensation: by which farmers in villages where the per-capita space of
farmland after land acquisition is more than 0.5 mu are resettled by monetary
compensation, that is, the land compensation and resettlement subsidy are paid to the
affected persons depending on the space of land taken.
3) Change of status by which farmers in villages where the per-capita space of farmland is
less than 0.5mu are resettled by having their status as agricultural population changed into
non-agricultural population. These people will thus receive a sum of RMB1.6 as land
compensation and resettlement subsidy After the number of status-changed persons is
decided, the farmland given up by them may be reallocated among villagers remaining in
the village depending on their willingness.
The status-changed farmers affected by land acquisition. may be resettled by monetary
compensation, insurance, social security support, etc.
1) Monetary compensation, by which the land compensation and resettlement subsidy are
paid to the status-changed persons to allow them to make a living;
2) Resettlement by basic social endowment insurance, by which those who are above 16
years of age but have not yet reached the age of retirement specified by the state
government may, by presenting their urban resident register and ID card, apply for the
basic endowment insurance for urban workers at the local social insurance agency. Those
who have secured this type of insurance and have actually paid the premium for 15 years
and longer may receive endowment insurance money on a monthly basis after they have
reached the age of 60 years for men and 55 years for women.
3) Resettlement by social security support, by which those status-changed persons may
apply for the minimum urban resident subsistence allowance if the average income of
them and their family members living together is lower than the minimum local subsistence
level of urban residents. The level of the allowance is determined according to the cost of
clothing, food and shelter necessary to maintain a decent life for a local urban resident
and in consideration of the cost of water and fuel (coal or gas) and compulsory schooling
of their young children. The standard of urban minimum subsistence allowance in the
affected  localities  are  respectively:  RMB185/person/month  in  Beibei  District,
RMB145/month in Jiangjin County, Changshou District, Tongliang County and Bishan
County, RMB115/person/month in Wulong County and RMB130/personlmonth in Dazu
County.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
For those farmers losing farmland, the local government will establish a complete labor service
system to provide assistance to them. The relevant labor service agency for the affected people will
be founded one month before land acquisition to help the resettled person get employed through all
possible channels. Such help includes, for example, giving the status-changed persons free access
to the job market, collecting job information from the local sources and providing it to the displace
persons one month before land acquisition and then publishing such information once a month
afterwards, providing free vocational training to the status-changed persons (such training is mainly
oriented to the demand of the local job market. For instance, in Dazu County, the training is
oriented to the acquisition of metalworking skills, and in Bishan County, it is oriented to the
acquisition of shoe-making skills, etc.). The labor service agency will also consult the enterprises
being constructed or seeking expansion and provide them with certain preferential incentive
policies (such as being exempted from part of tax if they employ the status-changed persons) in
order to make it easier for these persons to get employed.
6.1.2 HOUSE-REBUILDING PLAN
The house-rebuilding plan involves 66 urban households, 122 rural households, 18 enterprises and
institutions, and 38 shops.
(1) Rehabilitation of urban and rural residential houses
These projects will cause the demolition and relocation of 11,288,9m2 of urban residences,
affecting 330 persons in 66 households and 16,283.1m2 of rural residences, affecting 420 persons
in 122 households. After receiving the compensation at the replacement price, the affected persons
may choose to purchase cheap uniformly constructed resettlement apartments, new commercial
apartments or second-hand apartments. In addition, the rural residents may choose to build their
own houses.
Those who purchase cheap resettlement houses may buy such houses at the compensation price and
at the space standard of 18 m2 (17m2 in Tongliang County) per person. For limitation of design, the excessive
space is to be purchased at a rate 50% as much as the construction cost if it is not more than 5m2 and if the
space is in excess of 5m2 but less than the space of the demolished house, it may be purchased at the
combination price (construction cost plus land price). Any part exceeding the space of the demolished house is
to be purchased at the market price of a commercial house. The demolisher shall construct facilities such as
water and ground leveling in the resettlement area; water and power supplies shall be constructed
as planned. Those who choose monetary compensation and purchase commercial houses in the
affected localities may be exempted from the tax derived from the 1 8m2 (1 7m2 in Tongliang County)
per person space standard. For those who cannot afford to buy commercial apartments,
resettlement houses or second-hand houses, the local government shall provide cheap rent
houses after they have received the compensation.
Rural residents who choose to build their own houses by themselves shall be provided with sites
free of charge by the local government at the average per-capita space standard. They shall build
such houses according to the plan made by the village or township.
Facilities such as water; power and gas supplies, transportation, communications and cable TV
systems shall be constructed in the resettlement areas and commercial residential centers.
Schools, post offices, banks, food markets, bus stops, hospitals and other facilities shall be
constructed around the residential area to convenience the residents. The resettled persons may
choose to buy apartments of different grades in the residential area at their own will. These houses
are much better than their former houses (most of which were built in the 1970s to 1 980s) in quality,
structure, environment and accessibility. The second-hand houses are mostly old houses left by
the enterprises and institutions and are also better than their former houses in location, quality and
structure. Part of the vulnerable group suffering domestic poverty shall be provided with cheap-rent
houses by the government.

(2) Affected enterprises
These projects will affect 15 enterprises, of which two are no longer in production, one operates
seasonally and one is not running well. Three enterprises are affected by land acquisition only, six
are to be completely relocated and the rest are to be partly demolished. Enterprises whose land is
acquired will receive land compensation at the estimated land price, while those to be completely
relocated may, after receiving the compensation for construction land and buildings, choose to
move into the local industrial parks or planned new urban areas. As the transportation,
supplementary facilities and environment are uniformly planned; such enterprises will have better
operating conditions than before. The income loss of the employees of such enterprises during the
transition period will be compensated for. Enterprises to be partly demolished may choose to
rebuild their houses or use the compensation for other purposes.
(3) Affected institutions
The proposed projects will affect three institutions including two whose old offices are to be
demolished. These two institutions have new offices and will receive house compensation. The
Shuren College partly demolished will rebuild backwards.
(4) Affected shops
The projects will affect 38 shops of which 36 are to be completely demolished and relocated and 34
of them are located in Dazu County. These shops are all on the ground floor of the building of
which the second floor serves as the domestic living area. Two shops in Wulong County will not be
demolished and only their operation will be temporarily affected during construction of the project.
The 36 affected shops are all run by the families and these families will receive compensation at
the displacement price with which they can purchase shops of a similar floor space and structure in
similar locations. The shop owners may choose to purchase shops to continue operation or use the
compensation for other investments.
The two affected shops in Wulong County are operated on rent. The tenants can. be resettled in
two ways: in the first place, the demolisher provides the tenants houses that can be rented as
shops including shops of similar location and rent rate and helps them look for and arrange new
production houses. The tenants shall receive a movement allowance at the rate of RMB15/m2. The
owners of both shops shall receive compensation for loss of rent. In the second place, the
pennants shall be compensated for loss of income (including wages) due to discontinuation of
operation during the period of temporary impact and the owners of the two shops shall be paid a
compensation for loss of rent at the rate of RMB20,000 per year, which can be calculated
according to the actual duration of impact.
6.2 PROJECT IN TONGLIANG COUNTY
The project will acquire 221.32 mu of land for permanent use and 37.8 mu of land for temporary
use, affecting 57 people in 13 rural households, 26 people in 5 urban households, 41 people in 2
enterprises or institutions, 4 people in 2 shops. Altogether 2,898.71m2 of houses will be
demolished, affecting 819 people in 194 households, and 308 people need to be resettled by
production.

6.2;1.1    ANALYSIS OF IMPACT CAUSED BY LAND ACQUISITION
The project will permanently acquire 221.31 mu of land, which includes 161.33 mu of farmland,
3.35 mu of garden, 54.45 mu of forest, and 2.18 mu of fish pond, affecting 693 people in 4 villages
of Bachuan Township, and 308 people need to be resettled by production.
The sewage treatment plant project will acquire 64.95 mu of land, including 57.3 mu of farmland,
3.15 mu of garden, and 4.5 mu of forest. The flood-preventing embankment work will acquire
156.36 mu of land, including 104.03 mu of farmland,.0.2 mu of garden, 49.95 mu of forest and 2.18
mu of fishpond.

Table 6-1 shows that Yantu receives the greatest impact of the project. Currently there are 987
people and 323 mu of farmland in Yandu Village. The project will acquire 42.02 mu of farmland,
affecting 248 people in 62 rural households, and 127 need to be resettlement by production. The
land acquired accounts for 13% of the total area of farmland. Before acquisition, the per-capita
space of farmland is 0.33 mu and after acquisition, it becomes 0.28 mu, down by 7%. If the
average annual turnover of one mu of farmland is RMB1, 258, the per-capita annual income will
reduce by RMB63. As the per-capita income of this village was RMB2, 964 in 2003, land
acquisition will reduce it by about 2%. The contribution of agriculture and secondary and tertiary
industries to the income is respectively 8% and 92% (with the secondary and tertiary industries
calculated as a whole).
Obviously, the major source of income of the labourers affected by the project is from the
secondary and tertiary industries and land acquisition will cause no significant impact on their
income.

RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
6.2.1.2   REHABILITATION OF INCOME
(1) Resettlement plan
Through repeated consultation with the affected villagers, the following resettlement alternatives
will be provided for this project:
(D Changing status
Affected by land acquisition in construction of the project, the per-capita space of farmland of the
residents in Yandu Village will be not yet 0.3 mu and that in Tiyu Village not yet 0.5mu. Therefore
the affected labourers in both villages may choose to be resettled by having their status changed.
Each status-changed person may receive land compensation, resettlement subsidy and crop
compensation totalling RMB17,000. As the four villagers are all located in the planned expansion
area of the county seat, their land will be gradually taken in the next few years in the ongoing
urbanization process, the affected labourers in other two villages may choose to get resettled by
having their status changed. If some villagers who can have their status changed but are not willing
to do so, the village committee will resettle them by reallocating farmland among the villagers, that
is, the land given up by those who are not affected by land acquisition but are willing to have their
status changed will be reallocated to the former and the latter will have their status changed and
receive land compensation and resettlement subsidy.
(2) Monetary compensation
Those affected farmers who are willing to remain in the rural area to contact land for farming rather
than having their status changed will receive land compensation and resettlement subsidy
depending on the space of land taken from the resettlement agency at the rate of RMB30,000 per
mu.
Based on the current deposit interest rate of 2.79% for 5 years term, excluding tax on interest rate
20%, the real deposit rate is 2.232%. If the affected deposit the compensation RMB30, 000 in the
bank for 50 years, they will get about RMB997 each year, which is more than their current yearly
net income RMB1 50 from cultivated land.
) Livelihood support
The status-changed persons may enjoy the basic endowment insurance and minimum subsistence
allowance for urban residents. Those who have secured basic endowment insurance and have
actually paid the premium for 15 years and longer may receive endowment insurance money on a
monthly basis after they have reached the age of 60 years (for men) and 55 years (for women). In
Tongliang County, the minimum subsistence allowance is paid RMB145/month, which is RMB482
more than their average annual income of RMB1,258 from farming.
For those villagers who have chosen to get resettled by receiving monetary compensation and
whose families include surplus labourers, the village committee will provide them with training on
agricultural production technology and help them restructure their farming business to improve
income, such as developing greenhouse vegetable planting using the advantage of being close to
the urban area.
The local government will establish a complete labour service system to provide assistance to the
affected villagers such as providing them with information on employment, vocational training,
consultation with the local enterprises, etc. to pave the way for them to get employed.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
The four affected villages are close to the cities and most of them are located within the planned
area for construction of the new city. The construction of the new city and the new founded
enterprises and those seeking expansion in the development zones provide a lot of job
opportunities for the rural labour force (See TABLE 6-2). The local government will help the
affected labourers to get employment through training, providing employment information and
discussions with the enterprises. In this way, they can get a monthly wage of RMB400-800 and
their income level will restore or get even higher than it used to be.

6.2.2 REHABILITATION OF TEMPORARY LAND OCCUPATION
The temporary occupation of land for this project involves five villages of Bachuan Township.
Altogether 37.8 mu of land will be occupied including 21.6 mu of collective-owned land. Crop
compensation for land temporarily occupied will be paid in such as manner that the loss in one year
of occupation will be compensated for as 2.5 quarters, which means a total sum of compensation
money of RMB2,500. Constructing the project will occupy the land for about one year and the
compensation obtained is much higher than the actual loss as the average annual output value of
the farmland is only RMB1, 200 per mu. Therefore, the farmers' livelihood will not be affected.
After the project is completed, the affected choose how to restore the land. The constructor re-
cultivates the farmland occupied and retums it to the affected; village and group organize to check
and accept.
6.2.3 REHABILITATION OF URBAN RESIDENTIAL HOUSES
The resettlement of urban residents' houses for constructing this project in Bachuan Township will
involve 26 people in 5 households, totaling563.79m2. Residents whose houses have been
demolished will be resettled by monetary compensation (the standard being RMB400 per m2 for
brick+concrete structure houses and RMB350 per m2 for brick+wood structure houses, land prices
included). The affected people receiving the compensation money have three alternatives to make,
namely, to buy houses at a preferential price, purchase commercial houses and rent cheap-rent
houses.

CHONGOING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
(1) The resettled persons may choose to buy resettlement houses provided by the government at
a reduced price. They may buy such houses at the price equivalent to the compensation and at
the space standard of 17m2 per person. For limitation of design, the excessive space is to be
purchased at a rate 50% as much as the combination price (construction cost and land price
included), if it is not more than 5m2 and if the space is in excess of 5m2 but less than the space
of the former house demolished, it is may be purchased at the combination price. Any part
exceeding the space of the former house demolished is to be purchased at the price of
commercial houses. The demolisher is responsible for smoothing the ground and providing
water, power and gas supplies to the affected households.
The resettlement area is located in the planned new urban area and complete with various
supplementary facilities and well-developed transportation and communication. There is a road
system based on the G319 national highway route and the highway connectivity has reached a
total distance of 2,516 km. There, the 'five industries and one zone" (namely, the strontium salt
industry, building material industry, metallurgical and mechanical machining industry, silk and
garment industry, farm product processing industry and West Chongqing Technology Park)
have acquired shape. Furthermore, the newly built houses are much better than the former
houses in structure and quality and the resettled persons will feel more convenient than before
in livelihood, work and their children's schooling. They will notice dramatic improvement in
living standard and quality.
(2) For families who are not willing to purchase houses provided at a preferential price or built their
own houses on sites provided free, they might use the compensation money received to
purchase commercial houses in the city. The compensation should include the iand price,
which enables them to buy new or second-hand houses in Tongliang County. There is a rich
supply of new and second-hand houses in Tongliang County. The new house buildings are
fully equipped and built at places with convenient transportation facilities. The second-hand
house buildings are houses left by many enterprises and institutions. They are relatively
convenient in location and good in structure In comparison with the resettled person's former
houses (which were mostly built in the 1980s and are inferior in quality and structure), these
houses, whether they are uniformly constructed by the government or self-build by the resettled
persons or are new commercial houses or second-hand houses, are much better in quality,
structure and location. What is more, those who purchase commercial houses in Tongliang
County will be exempted from all the purchase fees and taxes. See TABLE 6-3 for information
about the supply of new commercial houses and second-hand houses.
(3) Those who cannot afford commercial houses and resettlement houses should be provided
cheap-rent houses by the government.
6.2.4 REHABILITATION OF RURAL RESIDENTIAL HOUSES
The resettlement of rural residents' houses for constructing this project in Bachuan Township will
involve 57 people in 13 households, totalling 1714.07m2 . Residents whose houses have been
demolished will be resettled by monetary compensation (the standard being RMB220 per m2 for
brick+concrete structure houses, RMB206 per m2 for brick+wood structure houses and RMB55 per
m2 for simple structure houses, land prices not included). The affected people receiving the
compensation money have three alternatives to make, namely, to construct their own houses, buy
resettlement houses at a preferential price, and purchase commercial houses. In the former case,
the resettlement agency shall pay compensation to the owner of the house demolished and at the
same time provide him free of charge with a house site. In the latter two cases, the resettlement
agency shall pay the affected household compensation not only for the house demolished but also
the house site taken.

(1) For those who choose to build their own houses, the local government shall provide free of
charge house sites at the space rate of 30m2 per person. The demolisher is responsible for
smoothing the ground and providing water and power supplies to the affected households. The
resettled persons may choose to build multi-story houses with the ground floor used as a shop
for business. It is known through survey that the resettled persons can perfectly build houses of
the same area as their former houses in the resettlement area with the compensation money
received.
(2) The resettled persons may choose to buy resettlement houses provided by the government at
a reduced price. They may buy such houses at the price equivalent to the compensation and at
the space standard of 17m2 per person. For limitation of design, the excessive space is to be

work and their children's schooling. They will notice dramatic improvement in living standard and
quality.
For families who are not willing to purchase resettlement houses or build their own houses, they
may use the compensation money received to purchase commercial houses in the city. The
compensation should include the land price (RMB180/m2). As they will be compensated for house
sites at the space rate of 30m2 per person and the price of urban land price (of RMB180m2), the
compensation enables them to buy new or second-hand houses in the urban area of Tongliang
County. There is a rich supply of new and second-hand houses in Tongliang County. The new
buildings are fully equipped and built at places with convenient transportation facilities. The
second-hand house buildings are houses left by many enterprises and institutions. They are
relatively convenient in location and good in structure in comparison with the resettled person's

CHONGOING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGOING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
6.2.5  RESETTLEMENT OF ENTERPRISES, INSTITUTIONS AND SHOPS
The project will affect 41 people in 2 enterprises and institutions with houses to be demolished
totalling 225.5 m2 in space, and 4 people in 2 shops with 395.35m2 of houses to be demolished.
The enterprises and institutions whose houses are to be demolished chose to get monetary
compensation and decided not to rebuild the houses. The fish-breeding centre can get
compensation for its farmland being permanently occupied and will receive a total amount of
RMB187,200 as resettlement subsidy and crop compensation. In addition, the three brick+concrete
guardhouses demolished will be compensated for at the rate of RMB220/m2 as if they were bought
new. Since the centre decided not to rebuild the houses, it can get compensation for the loss of
house site (at the rate of RMB9, 600 per mu for rural house sites). Thus the total compensation for
houses is RMB123, 100. The affected employees of the fish-breeding center are all migrant
workers and the project-executing agency will inform them 2 months before land acquisition take
place so that they have sufficient time to get reemployed.
Bachuan Township Enterprise Office has only one empty house to be demolished and therefore its
demolition will not affect the office's normal work. As the office is an institution whose land was
provided by the government free of charge, it can get the house compensation only.
Since all the shops to be demolished were made by the owners from part of their residences, they
are all willing to get resettled by getting house sites provided by the government after receiving
compensation for house demolition and loss of operation income to build their own houses. In the
resettlement area, they may chose to build multi-storry houses with the ground floor used as the
shop for business. The demolisher is responsible for smoothing the ground and providing water,
power and gas supplies to the area. As the resettlement area is located in the planned new urban
area with complete supplementary facilities and well-developed transportation and communications
systems, the affected shop owners can expect an improved business atmosphere.
See TABLE 6-4 and TABLE 6-5 for the resettlement of the affected enterprises, institutions and
shops.

Of the three handicapped people, two will be affected by both land acquisition and house
demolition and one by land acquisition only. Zhou Xinghui and Zhang Jiankang are one family
living separately. Because their house to be demolished is fairly large in floor space, the
compensation enables them to self-build houses on sites provided to them free of charge. In the
process of building construction, the village committee will offer assistance.
For those vulnerable groups affected by land acquisition, the land compensation and resettlement
subsidy may be paid to their children who take the responsibility for arranging their livelihood. The
village leadership will offer vocational training for the labourers in their families or provide them with
employment information and instruction to make it easier for them to get employed.

From TABLE 6-7, it can be seen that Mingugang Village has the largest space of acquired land,
which is 56.76 mu, affecting 118 people and 82 people need to be resettled by production, and that
Yujian Village has the smallest space of acquired land, which is 3.1 mu only, affecting 10 people
and 7 people need to be resettled by production. Mingguang Village has 1 group, where has 2867
people and 2208mu farmland. The project will acquire 56.76 mu of farmland, accounting for 2.6%
of the total farmland, which affects 118 people, and 82 need to be resettlement by production. The
per-capita annual income of Mingguang Village is RMB3250, including industrial income RMB2275,
agricultural income RMB975 that accounts for 30% of the total income. If the average annual
turnover of one mu of farmland is RMB500, the per-capita annual income will reduce by RMB132,
less than 1%.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
From the above analysis, it can be seen that the impact of land acquisition on the farmers' total
income will be limited. The survey reveals that the farmers in these villages rely very little on the
farmland, which seems to have lost its appeal to them. At present, more than 90% of the villagers
are engaged in the metal ware industry and about 50% of them run small metal ware plants in their
houses. Those who do not run metal ware workshops in their houses normally have their family
members working in the metal ware enterprises in the urban area nearby. The income from running
their own businesses and working in the enterprises account for 81% of the villagers' non-
agriculture income and their income from farming constitutes a fairly small part. Moreover, most of
them now do not work in the field themselves but instead hire other people to do it from them. It
can be said definitely that the livelihood of farmers. living in the project area will not change
significantly due to land acquisition.
6.3.1.2   REHABILITATION OF INCOME
By extensive discussions with the villagers, it is decided that they will be resettled by reallocation of
farmland and the land compensation and resettlement subsidy will be paid equally to each
household.
The affected villages can get a total amount of RMB3.19 million as compensation for land
acquisition and subsidy for resettlement, of which Mingguang Village gets RMB1.218 million,
Xingguang Village RMB0.423 million, Yujian Village RMBO.066 million, Longdong Village
RMB0.751 million and Yongyi Village 0.734 million. The land compensation and resettlement
subsidy for each mu is RMB21, 450-40,800. Based on the current deposit interest rate 2.79%
above 5 years, excluding tax on interest rate 20%, the real deposit rate is 2.232%. If the affected
deposit the compensation RMB21,450-40,800 in the bank for 50 years, they will get about
RMB713-1458 each year, which is more than their current yearly net income RMB600(RMB220)
from dry land(paddy field).
After receiving the compensation, the villagers may continue to invest in small metal ware
workshops. This will help them make their current income level of RMB600-700 per month even
higher. Those villagers (accounting for about 10% of the total population) who live on farming can
expect to get a high income from agriculture by renting the farmland of other villagers.
Longshui Township has a long history in making metal ware products the business is fairly large in
scale with a complete sales network in operation. Currently some 50,000 people are engaged in
this industry, which turns out products of 20,000 sizes in 200 varieties and 12 categories.
Advanced technologies are widely employed in the hardening centre, surface-treating centre and
grinding centre. Some famous brands like Jinzhong, Yonghong and Wangsheng are selling well on
both the domestic and overseas markets. The metal transaction market, metal ware market and
metal ware tourist centre have now been constructed and put into operation. With an annual sales
volume of RMB1, 800 million, Longshui Township has become the largest production. and
distribution centre for small metal ware in Southwest China.
There are a number of enterprises around the affected villages, which are doing quite well. The
owners of these enterprises have promised that they will provide some jobs for the labourers in the
affected villages. See TABLE 6-8 for statistics of these enterprises.

From the table above, it can be seen that the five villages have a sufficient capability to arrange the
affected farmers to work in the enterprises and their income will therefore be better than it was
before land acquisition.
6.3.2 REHABILITATION OF TEMPORARY LAND OCCUPATION
Temporary occupation of land for constructing the project will affect five villages. Altogether 27.6
mu of land will be temporarily occupied; the compensation for temporary land occupation will be
made according to the annual yield of these dry fields. Half a year of occupation will be
compensated for as one whole year with the per-mu 'compensation being RMB1, 800. Since the
project will temporarily occupy the land will last for 6 months, the loss of yield is then RMB1,
000-1200/mu as the period is regarded as one year. Therefore, the compensation received is more
than the actual loss caused and the farmer' livelihood will not be affected by the temporary
occupation of land.
As for the rehabilitation of land temporarily occupied, a preliminary agreement has been reached
between the affected villages and the project executor, which stipulates that the constructor shall
smooth the land, loosen the ground compacted by engineering machinery and improve the quality
of soil and the land-administration agency will conduct acceptance of the restored land.
6.3.3 RESETTLEMENT OF URBAN RESIDENTS
To construct the project, the houses of 60 urban families in Longshui Township will be demolished,
affecting 298 people, with a total floor space of 10,345.09 m2.
All the houses of these urban residents affected by the project are above 45m2 in space. See
TABLE 6-9 for statistics of the space distribution of the houses.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
6.3.5 RESETTLEMENT OF AFFECTED ENTERPRISES
The project will cause two enterprises to be resettled, affecting 38 people, and 1,993.71 m2 of
houses will have to be demolished.
The two affected enterprises are Grease Refinery and Post And Communication Equipment Plant,
which houses will be completely demolished. According to the compensation rates, the enterprises
will get compensation at the rate of RMB226/m2 for their brick+concrete structure houses and
RMB205/m2 for brick+wood structure houses, and be paid compensation at the rate of RMB1 15/M2
for house lands, and be paid for the damage of facilities and financial subsidies for resettlement
and reconstruction. According to the general plan of Longshui Township authorities, the affected
enterprises will be resettled by monetary compensation in the industrial park area of the township.
The affected enterprises can buy the land of the industry park at preferential prices (RMB8O, 000-
120,000/mu). The compensation enables them to rebuild new factories in the industry park. The
resettled enterprises may then make preparations for reconstruction in advance so that
reconstruction takes place before demolition to minimize impact on the enterprise and employee.
Longshui industrial park was approved in 2003 by Chongqing municipal government as one of
Chongqing's 30 feature industrial parks. The park covers a planned area of 6 square kilometres. At
present, construction of the first 1.55 km2 of the park has been initiated, of which 0.78 km2 has
been completed. Currently 93 enterprises have moved into the area, generating an annual
industrial output value of RMB520 million, sales income of RMB478 million and profit of RMB118
million.
See Table 6.11 for the resettlement of affected enterprises.

6.3.6 RESETTLEMENT OF AFFECTED SHOPS
The project will cause 34 shops to be demolished and resettled, affecting 164 people, with a total
space of 1,746.68 m2. These shops have the following features: (1) made from residential houses
along the road or riverside, (2) run by the owners themselves and helped basically by the their
family members, and (3) engaged in metal ware products.
The socio-economic survey involved inquiries into the preferences of the shop owners concerning
resettlement. Through discussions between the demolisher and shop owners in consideration of
the actual condition of the places where the shops are located, it is decided that the resettlement
will take the form of monetary compensation.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
After demolition and resettlement, the shop owners will receive house compensation (at the rate of
RMB1,980/m2 for brick+concrete structure houses, RMB1,780/m2 for brick+wood structure houses
and RMB1,280/M2 for simple structure houses, all including land price). The financial subsidy for
movement of facilities and compensation for damages caused by closure of business will be
amount to a total amount of RMB3.2569 million and this means that each shop can get RMB63,
000 on the average. The shop owners may use this compensation money to purchase business
houses of better location and space (Longshui Teacher's st., business side walk st.) in Longshui
Township. See TABLE 6-12 for information about the shop market in Longshui Township.
The shops affected by the project will be resettled in Nanyuan residential area, which was
developed by Dazu Nanyuan Real Estate Co. and has a total floor space of 12,00Om2. The average
selling price of the houses is RMB36G/m2. The houses have been designed into different layouts
with sizes ranging from tens of square meters to more than one hundred square meters to suit the
requirements of the resettled families. The residential area is complete with water, power and gas
supplies, transport facilities and communication and cable TV systems. Schools, post offices,
banks, grocery market, bus stops, hospitals and other infrastructures have been built around the
area to convenience the residents.
The employees of the demolished shops are mostly family members of the owner except for a very
few migrant workers. The project executing agent will inform these migrant workers 2 months
before land acquisition takes place to allow enough time for them to get reemployed. Rescannable
compensation will be made for losses caused during movement and closure of business at the rate
of RMB120/M2 depending on the operation of these shops. As the shops in Longshui Township are
engaged mostly in metal ware industry and the places to which the shops are moved are all busy
areas of the township, these affected shop owners can perfectly expect an income level not lower
than before as long as they properly manage their business in their new houses.
See TABLE 6-12 for the resettlement of affected shops.

6.3.7 REHABILITATION OF AFFECTED VULNERABLE GROUPS
The project will affect 25 households, of which 3 are affected by land acquisition and 21 by house
demolition. The floor space of the residential houses to be demolished ranges from 5Om2 to 30Om2.
The affected households include 15 impoverished families, most of which consist of unemployed
labourers, 5 families with handicapped members, 3 families consisting mainly of women and 2
families consisting of old people living alone. The impoverished families are those who have laid-
offs and haven't found jobs of higher salary. See TABLE for detail.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
Of the affected vulnerable group's families, four are rural families with three (affected by land
acquisition) in Mingguang Village and one (affected by both land acquisition and house demolition)
in Xingguang, including 3 handicapped persons and I impoverished person. The source of their
family income is chiefly farming. If the village authorities launch the collective land development
plan such as growing vegetables on a large scale, they will give priority to hiring them or renting the
land of the vulnerable group' families, and priority will be given to training the labourers of the three
families in skills and then arranging them to work in the enterprises. As for the impoverished family
in Xingguang Village, the village leadership will help them build their own house.
The other vulnerable group's families are all urban families affected by house demolition. As their
houses are mostly larger than 80m2 in floor space, according to the compensation rates, the money
they receive will be enough to enable them to purchase new or second-hand houses. For those
whose houses area is below 50m2, if troubled by sheer poverty and unable to afford to buy houses,
the government will provide them with cheap rental houses, which are chiefly located on Longgu
Road and Gunang Street. These houses are within 80-90 m2 in floor space and monthly cost
M22
RMB1.2/m for brick+concrete structure and RMBO.6/m2 for brick+wood structure. Though cheap
in rent, these houses are located in places with convenient transport systems and complete
supplementary facilities such as shopping centres, hospitals and schools to ensure the quality of
the vulnerable group's livelihood. In comparison with their former houses demolished, these
houses are superior in all aspects.
On the other hand, for the surplus labourers in the vulnerable group's families, the government will
give priority to arranging them to work in the local enterprises. As Longshui Township has metal
ware product as its major industry and boasts the iargest metal ware market in China, it poses no
problem to arrange a few labourers from the vulnerable group's families.
Following the custom of respecting and caring about the old in Longshui Township, the government
will pay visit to the affected people's homes in all major traditional holidays. Through such visits,
the government is able to know how this vulnerable group are living and find out the problems they
have in daily life and feed back the information to the project owner and independent supervisor.
6.3.8 REHABILITATION OF AFFECTED INFRASTRUCTURES AND GROUND ATTACHMENTS
(1) The affected power poles in Mingguang Village are used to supply power to the farmers'
homes nearby and pumps for irrigation and will lose their function with the land being occupied.
The loss incurred will be compensated for by monetary means.
(2) The toilet is used by the residents living nearby and will lose its function with the land being
acquired. The project owner will compensate its owner for the loss.
(3) The stone. pavement demolished will be replaced by new embankment.
(4) The wharf is a simple passenger wharf and will be rebuilt when constructing the embankment.
(5) The fruit trees and bamboos will be compensated for by monetary means during land
clearance.
(6) The natural gas pipeline and power line will not be demolished until they are constructed in
other suitable locations so as to minimize impact on the residents around the construction area.

The project will acquire 243.74 mu of land including 14.5 mu of enterprise land for permanent use
and 94.82 mu of land for temporary use, affecting 189 people in 56 households, and cause
7,941.9m2 of houses to be demolished, affecting 459 people in 123 households, and 194 people

The project will acquire 243.74 mu of land for permanent use including 186.78 mu of farmland and
0.8 mu of fishpond, affecting 277 people in two villages in Duzhou Township and three villages in
Fenghuang Township and 194 people need to be resettled by production.

____________in coming years <03    1
From TABLE 6-14, it can be seen that the percentage of per-capita space of farmland to be
affected is 5%-9% and Madao Village will receive the heaviest impact of land acquisition. The
village will have 18 mu of farmland to be acquired, accounting for 14.6% of the total space of
farmland and 23 people will be affected and 16 labourers need to be resettled by production. After
acquisition, the per-capita space of farmland will become 0.89mu, down by 9%. If the average
annual per-mu yield of the farmland is RMB500, land acquisition will cause the yield to drop by
RMB45. As the net per-capita income of this village was RMB2, 487 in 2003, land acquisition will
bring it down by 2%.
The above analysis shows reveals the fact that land acquisition has no major impact on the per-
capita income of all the affected villages. Moreover, about 20% of the labourers in each of the five
villages no longer rely on their land for making a living. The income they get by working as migrant
workers accounts for 50% of their total income. Therefore, land acquisition does not constitute a
major impact on the villagers.

CHONGOING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
6.4.1.2   REHABILITATION OF INCOME
(1) Resettlement plan
Through extensive consultations with the affected villagers, resettlement will be arranged in the
following ways:
6 Changing status
As all the five affected villages are located in the planned area for construction of the county seat,
the land will be acquired gradually in the coming years in the ongoing urbanization process.
Therefore, resettlement of the affected villagers may take the form of changing status depending
on the actual condition and villagers' willingness. For those who can have their status changed but
are unwilling to do so, the village committee will reallocate land among the villagers, that is, to
allocate farmland give up by villagers not affected by land acquisition but are willing to have their
status changed to the former and the latter will have their status changed and receive the land
compensation and resettlement subsidy. The status-changed persons will receive a total amount of
RMB16,000 as land compensation and resettlement subsidy.
Q Monetary compensation
The project-executing agency will pay compensation to farmers who choose to stay in the rural
area for farming rather than having their status changed according to the space of land taken from
them. The five affected villages may receive a total amount of RMB5.2634 million as land
compensation and resettlement subsidy, including RMB3.175 million for Yanqiao Villager,
RmB0.963 million for Xinghua Village, RMBO.395 million for Huohua Village, RMBO.227 million for
Kejiaping Village and RMB0.504 million for Maodao.
Each mu of land taken can be compensated for RMB 28,000. Based on the current deposit interest
rate 2.79% above 5 years, excluding tax on interest rate 20%, the real deposit rate is 2.232%. If the
affected deposit the compensation RMB28, 000 in the bank for 50 years, they will get about
RMB930 each year, which is more than their current yearly net income RMB650 from cultivated
land.
(Livelihood support
The status-changed persons may enjoy the basic endowment insurance and minimum subsistence
allowance for urban residents. Those who have secured basic endowment insurance and have
actually paid the premium for 15 years and longer may receive endowment insurance money on a
monthly basis after they have reached the age of 60 years (for men) and 55 years (for women). In
Changshou District, the minimum subsistence allowance is paid RMB145/month, which is more
than their average annual income of RMB1,000 from farming.
For those villagers who have chosen to get resettled by receiving monetary compensation and
whose families include surplus labourers, the village committee will provide them with training on
agricultural production technology and help them restructure their farming business to improve
income, such as developing greenhouse vegetable planting using the advantage of being close to
the urban area.
The local government will establish a complete labour service system to provide assistance to the
affected villagers such as providing them with information on employment, vocational training,
consultation with the local enterprises, etc. to pave the way for them to get employed.
The five affected villages are close to the cities and most of them are located within the planned
area for construction of the new city. The construction of the new city and the new founded
enterprises and those seeking expansion in the development zones provide a lot of job
opportunities for the rural labour force (See TABLE 6-15). The local government will help the
affected labourers to get employment through training, providing employment information and
discussions with the enterprises. In this way, they can get a monthly wage of RMB400-800.

6.4.2 REHABILITATION OF TEMPORARY LAND OCCUPATION
This project will occupy 94.82 mu of land for temporary use including 84.5 mu of collective-owned
land and 10.32 mu of state-owned land Crop compensation for the land temporarily occupied will
be paid in such as manner that the loss in one year of occupation will be compensated for as 2.5
quarters, which means a total sum of RMB25 million in compensation. Constructing the project will
occupy the land for about o'ne year and the compensation obtained is much higher than the actual
loss as the average annual output value of the farmland is only RMB1, 600 per mu. Therefore, the
farmers' livelihood will not be affected.
After the project is completed, the constructor will re-cultivate the farmland occupied and return it to
the village and group, and the village and group organize to check and accept.
6.4.3 RESETTLEMENT OF RURAL RESIDENTS
The resettlement of rural residents' houses for constructing this project in will involve 189 people in
56 households of 7 villages in Duzhou and Fengcheng Townships. Altogether 7,941.9 m2 of houses
will be demolished. Residents whose houses have been demolished will be resettled by monetary
compensation (the standard being RMB215 per m2 for brick+concrete structure houses, RMB190
per m2 for brick+wood structure houses and RMB50 per m2 for simple structure houses). The
affected people receiving the compensation money have three alternatives to make, namely, to
construct their own houses on sites provided free by the demolish, purchase resettlement houses
at a preferential price and purchase commercial houses. In the former case, the resettlement
agency shall pay compensation to the owner of the house demolished and at the same time
provide him free of charge with a house site. In the latter two cases, the resettlement agency shall
pay the affected household compensation not only for the house demolished but also the house
site taken.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
(1) For those who choose to build their own houses, the local government shall provide free of
charge house sites at the space rate of 3Om2 per person. The demolisher is responsible for
smoothing the ground and providing water and power supplies to the affected households. The
resettled persons may choose to build multi-story houses with the ground floor used as a shop
for business. It is known through survey that the resettled persons can perfectly build houses of
the same area as their former houses in the resettlement area with the compensation money
received.
(2) The resettled persons may choose to buy resettlement houses provided by the government at
a reduced price. They may buy such houses at the price equivalent to the compensation and at
the space standard of 1 8m2 per person. For limitation of design, the excessive space is to be
purchased at a rate 50% as much as the combination price (construction cost and land price
included), if it is not more than 5m2 and if the space is in excess of Sm2 but less than the space
of the former house demolished, it is may be purchased at the combination price. Any part
exceeding the space of the former house demolished is to be purchased at the price of
commercial houses. The demolisher is responsible for smoothing the ground and providing
water, power and gas supplies to the affected households.
(3) For families who are not willing to purchase houses provided at a preferential price or built their
own houses on sites provided free, they might use the compensation money received to
purchase commercial houses in the city. As the project-executing agency pays the house site
compensation at the space rate of 3Om2 per person at the price of RMB300/m2, this
compensation enables them to buy second-hand houses in Changshou District. Many of the
second-hand house buildings in Changshou District are houses left by enterprises and
institutions. They are relatively convenient in location and good in structure. Furthermore, those
who choose to get resettled by monetary compensation and purchase commercial houses in
Changshou District will be exempted from all the purchase fees and taxes. See TABLE 6-16 for
information about the supply of new commercial houses and second-hand houses.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
The uniform resettlement houses (the layout types are among 80-120m ) and resettlement area are
located in the new urban area of Taohua Township and complete with various supplementary
facilities and well-developed transport and communication systems. Taohua New City is the future
political centre of Changshou District, as all the major district government agencies will be moved
here. A number of public facilities have been planed, which include administrative offices,
apartments, commercial and financial establishments, entertainment, medical and sanitation
institutions, green spaces and other urban infrastructures. As the area is located at the joint of the
Chongqing-Fuling and Chongqing-Wanzhou expressways, urbanization of the area has been in
fast development since these expressways were opened to traffic. According to the schedule, the
area will reach its planed size in 3 to 5 years. The Taohua New City Area covers an area of 6.7 km2
with a planed population of nearly 100,000 million. Since the existing old city area is too small and
too densely populated, 30,000 residents will be moved to the new city area and so will be the
district government agencies, institutions and functionaries and a number of schools will be built
there, all of which will bring about 20,000 people this area. Further, the construction of chemical
industrial park and special product Industrial park will enlarge the area to 36km2. As the design of
both parks does not include the residential area, about 20,000 people will go to reside in the
Taohua New City area. With the quickening of the urbanization process, it is estimated that 6,000
people will go to reside in the new city area each year. This means an increase of 30,000 people in
5 years. The city plan requires that the new city area will take shape in 3 years and completed in 5
years with a total population of 99.100.
The newly built houses are better in structure and quality and the resettled residents will feel more
convenient in daily life, work and their children's schooling than before. Their living standard and
quality of life will be much improved. The field survey shows that more than 90% of them prefer to
build their own houses.
6.4.4 RESETTLEMENT OF ENTERPRISES
The project will affect three enterprises by land acquisition and 14.5 mu of land will be acquired.
Since the land to be acquired is left unused, land acquisition will not affect the operation of the
enterprises. They can get the compensation for loss of land only at the rate of RMB200,000/mu.
The price is subject to change according to the actual assessment when the compensation is
made.
6.4.5 RESETTLEMENT OF AFFECTED VULNERABLE GROUPS
The project will affect five people of the vulnerable group in three families, one consisting of
handicapped people and two of old people living alone. See TABLE 6-17for detail.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
These three families are all affected by temporary land occupation and house demolition. They
have remained land in their families. Through consultation with them, none of them are willing to
get resettled by changing status. After receiving the monetary compensation, they are willing to
build their own houses on the house sites allocated to them free of charge and the village
committee will assist them in house construction. At the same time, the project constructor will give
priority in restoring their land temporarily taken.
The village leadership will provide free technical training for the vulnerable group and help them
develop agricultural production to get better income and at the same time provide vocational
training for the labourers in their families and supply them with information about employment and
guidance to increase their chance to get employed.
6.5 BICHENG WATER SUPPLY PROJECT IN BISHAN COUNTY
The project will acquire 37.01 mu of land for permanent use and occupy 40.7 mu of land for
temporary use, affecting 296 people in 91 households including 54 labourers.

This project will acquire 37.01 mu of collective-owned land including 34.55 mu of farmland and 2.46
mu of wasteland, affecting 210 people in three groups of Huangjiao and Wuli Villages in Binan
Township and 54 people need to be resettled by production: The Qiancengyan water supply plant
project will acquire 27.B mu of land including 26.2 mu of farmland and 1.6 mu of wasteland,
affecting 146 people and 46 people need to be resettled by production. The pressurizing pump
station will acquire 9.21 mu of land including 8.35 mu of farmland and 0.86 mu of wasteland,
affecting 66 people and 9 people need to be resettled by production. See TABLE 6-18 for the
impact on each village.

From the table above, it can be seen that Group 5 of Huangjiao Village will receive the heaviest
impact-21.7 mu of farmland will be acquired, accounting for 37% of the total space of farmland.
The per-capita space of farmland will decrease by 0.12 mu or 36%, affecting 166 people and 39
people need to be resettled by production. If the average annual yield of the farmland is RMB500
per mu, it will go down by RMB93. As the annual per-capita income of people in Huangjiao Village
is RMB3, 101, land acquisition will reduce their income by about 3%.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
It is found from the survey that the land acquired is sloppy, difficult to toil and poor in yield and
none of the farmers are willing to cultivate. In addition, the agricultural output value of the two
villages account for about 1/4 of the total turnover. The income from farming, which is 12.7%, of a
rural family constitutes only a small part of its total income but the income from working in the
urban area accounts for a lion's share, which is 87.3%. Therefore, the impact caused by land
acquisition on the two villages will be quite limited.
6.5.1.2   REHABILITATION OF INCOME
(1) Resettlement plan
Currently there are many job opportunities for farmers in Bishan County. Young labouring people
are now seldom engaged in farming but instead go to work and run business in the city. Through
analysis of the scale of economic development, features of the agro-economic structure, per-capita
ownership of land resources and composition of the villagers' income and repeated hearing of the
comments of the villagers' representatives, it is agreed that the villagers affected by land
acquisition will be resettled in the following manners:
(1) Changing status
The affected farmers may choose to have their status changed and receive a total amount of
RMB16,000 as land compensation and resettlement subsidy. The village leadership will reallocate
land among villagers.
.For those who can have their status changed but are unwilling to do so, the village committee will
reallocate land among the villagers, that is, to allocate farmland give up by villagers not affected by
land acquisition but are willing to have their status changed to the former and the latter will have
their status changed and receive the land compensation and resettlement subsidy.
(2) Monetary compensation
For those affected farmers who are willing to remain in the rural area to contact land for farming
rather than having their status changed, the project-executing agency will make compensation
according to the space of land taken.
The two affected villages may receive a total amount of RMB1.408 million as land compensation
and resettlement subsidy, including RMBO.205 million for community 3 and RMBO.922 million for
community 5 of Huangjiao Village and RMBO.2805 million for Wuli Village.
Each mu of land taken can be compensated for RMB31,943-42,500. Based on the current deposit
interest rate 2.79% above 5 years, excluding tax on interest rate 20%, the real deposit rate is
2.232%. If the affected deposit the compensation RMB31,943-42,500 in the bank for 50 years,
they will get about RMB1,061-1,284 each year, which is more than their current yearly net income
RMB650 from cultivated land.
(3) Livelihood support
The status-changed persons may enjoy the basic endowment insurance and minimum subsistence
allowance for urban residents. Those who have secured basic endowment insurance and have
actually paid the premium for 15 years and longer may receive endowment insurance money on a
monthly basis after they have reached the age of 60 years (for men) and 55 years (for women). In
Bishan County, the minimum subsistence allowance is paid RMB145/month, which is more than
their average annual income of RMB600 from farming.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
For those villagers who have chosen to get resettled by receiving monetary compensation and
whose families include surplus labourers, the village committee will provide them with training on
agricultural production technology and help them restructure their farming business to improve
income, such as developing greenhouse vegetable planting using the advantage of being close to
the urban area.
The local government will establish a complete labour service system to provide assistance to the
affected villagers such as providing them with information on employment, vocational training,
consultation with the local enterprises, etc. to pave the way for them to get employed.
In the past 20 years, township enterprises and private businesses have experienced a fast growth,
which have accounted for more than 90% of the county's industrial sector and become the major
part of the local economy. Machine building, building materials and shoe making have become
three mainstay industries in Bishan County. Large enterprises such as Bishan Anzi Cement Mill
and Chongqing Dajiang Motorcycle Engines Co. Ltd. have come into being. In Bicheng Township,
there are Aokang Shoe-making Co., Chuandong Shock Absorbers Factory, Shudong Machinery
Plant, Shazhichuan Leather Shoe Factory, Bluelight Motorcycle and Car Parts Factory,
Qiangrenzhou Leather Shoes Factory, Kerse Leather Shoes Factory, Zongshen Three-wheel
Motorcycles Co. and Bicheng Knitting Mill. The ordinary workers in these enterprises receive a
salary of RMB600-1,200. The township and enterprises and private businesses in Bicheng
Township provide 3,000-4,000 jobs each year, including cleaners, cargadors and construction
workers. According to the survey, the average monthly salary of the ordinary workers in the local
enterprise is about RMB500-600. By acquisition such measures, the farmers' income will increase
as the enterprises keep growing so that it will not be lower than it was before land acquisition or
even higher.
6.5.2 REHABILITATION OF TEMPORARY LAND OCCUPATION
The temporary land occupation for this project is caused by the construction of water supply
pipelines. This will affect two villages and 40.73 mu of land will be temporarily occupied. The
occupation of land will last for not yet three months (but will be regarded as three months when
making compensation). According to the rates of compensation for loss of crops during temporary
occupation of land, the compensation will be RMB1, 200/mu for farmland and RMB1, 400/mu for
fishpond. As the loss of crops and fishes during one quarter is about RMB500/mu and RMB800/mu
respectively, the compensation is much higher than the actual loss of farmland and fishpond.
The temporarily occupied land will be restored after use by the constructor. As the operation on the
temporarily occupied land includes trench cutting, pipe laying and backfilling, the constructor will
restore the land by cutting and backfilling the ground section by section according to the actual
condition. Each section will be restored in no longer than 2 months. By this method, the impact
caused by temporary occupation of land will be reduced to a minimum.
In one word, after getting the compensation, the affected villagers' livelihood will not deteriorate but
instead will recover to the level before land taking.
6.5.3 REHABILITATION OF AFFECTED VULNERABLE GROUPS
The vulnerable groups to be affected by this project are old people's families in Huangjiao village.
Their conditions are as follows:
Zhang Guangming, aged 97, lives in Huangjiao Village. There are 12 members in his family with a
total space of farmland of 1.4 mu, of which o.65 mu will be occupied permanently for constructing
the water plant. The annual income of the family is RMB14, 720 mainly eared by his children from
working away from home. The income from farming accounts for only a very small part in the total
income. Therefore land acquisition will produce no major impact on the financial standing of their
families.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
Zhu Yuqing, 84 years of age, lives in Huangjiao Village. The family consists of the old couple only
without any children and has a space of farmland of 0.7 mu, of which 0.3 mu will be occupied
permanently for constructing the water plant. The annual income of the family is RMB4, 000 and
farming is the major source of income.
There are three altematives to resettle these disadvantaged people:
Alternative 1: Change status and leave them in the family. The project owner pays the land
compensation and resettlement subsidy to them (or their children) through the village leadership so
that they spend the rest of their life in the family. Their children bear all the cost of supporting them
and at the same time they enjoy all the welfare given to the urban residents.
Alternative 2: Reallocate the land. If the old person (or his children looking after him/her) wishes to
get farmland, the village leadership will coordinate and uses their chance of status change to get
the farmland of other people in the village who are not affected by land acquisition but wish to
change status. In this way they will get the farmland they want. By land reallocation within a narrow
scope, the old people's families can get more farmland and by providing them with technical
training and assistance to restructure their farming, their livelihood can recover to the level before
land acquisition.
Alternative 3: Resettle by public welfare. The land compensation and resettlement subsidy for
these people are paid to the local public welfare bureau. In this way Zhu and his wife can pay
regular visit to the public welfare bureau to get their subsistence money. Or the land compensation
and resettlement subsidy are paid to the neighbourhood rest home in Bicheng Township where the
old couple will be acquired care of for the rest of their life.
Moreover, during construction of the water plant, priority will be given to employing the children of
the vulnerable group to do some work of low technical requirement such as ground smoothing,
excavation and soil removal on the construction site so that they can get some income.
Following the custom of respecting and caring about the old in Longshui Township, the government
will pay visit to the affected people's homes in all major traditional holidays. Through such visits,
the government is able to know how this vulnerable group are living and find out the problems they
have in daily life and feed back the information to the project owner and independent supervisor.
The project owner will then come up with solutions according to the actual situation.
6.5.4 AFFECTED GROUND ATTACHMENTS
The affected ground attachments will be compensated for by the project-executing agency and
rebuilt by the farmers.
6.6 BINAN RIVER PROJECT IN BISHAN COUNTY
This project will acquire 537.045mu of land for permanent use and 26 mu for temporary use,
affecting 100 people in 30 rural households and 101 people in 8 enterprises and institutions.
Altogether 12,729.5 m2 of houses will be demolished, affecting 842 people in 209 households and
483 people need to be resettled by production.

The project will permanently acquire 537.045 mu of land including 314.01 mu of farmland, 15.5 mu
of fish pond and 8.1 mu of riverside shallow land, affecting 700 people in 7 villages of Bicheng

From TABLE 6-19, it can be seen that Xinta Village will receive the heaviest impact. There are
currently 1,039 people and 756 mu of farmland in the village. The project will acquire 88.5 mu of
farmland, accounting for 4.36% of the total space of farmland and affecting 172 people including
121 labourers. The land acquired accounts for 1.6% of the total space of farmland. After
acquisition, the per-capita space of farmland will diminish by 0.64 mu, down by 12.3%. If the
average annual yield of the farmland is RMB500 per mu, the per-capita income from farmland will
go down by RMB61. As the net annual per-capita income of the village was RMB3, 022, it will go
down by 5% after land acquisition.
Apparently, land acquisition will create no significant impact on any of these villages.
6.6.1.2    REHABILITATION OF INCOME
(1) Resettlement plan
Through extensive consultations with the affected villagers, resettlement will be arranged for this
project in the following two ways:
( Changing status
As all the seven affected villages are located in the planned area for construction of the county
seat, the land will be acquired gradually in the coming years in the ongoing urbanization process.
Therefore, resettlement of the affected villagers may take the form of changing status depending
on the actual condition and villagers' willingness. The status-changed persons will receive a total
amount of RMB16,000 as land compensation and resettlement subsidy and their land will be
reallocated among villagers.
For those who can have their status changed but are unwilling to do so, the village committee will
reallocate land among the villagers, that is, to allocate farmland give up by villagers not affected by
land acquisition but are willing, to have their status changed to the former and the latter will have
their status changed and receive the land compensation and resettlement subsidy. The affected
.farmers may choose to have their status changed and receive a total amount of RMB16,000 as
land compensation and resettlement subsidy. The village leadership will reallocate land among
villagers.

For those affected farmers who are willing to remain in the rural area to contact land for farming
rather than having their status changed, the project-executing agency will make compensation
according to the space of land taken. Each mu of land taken can be compensated for RMB34,850.
Based on the current deposit interest rate 2.79% above 5 years, excluding tax on interest rate 20%,
the real deposit rate is 2.232%. If the affected deposit the compensation RMB34,850 in the bank
for 50 years, they will get about RMB1,158 each year, which is much more than their current yearly
net income RMB500 from cultivated land.
The seven affected villages will get a total amount of RMB1 1.895 million as land compensation and
resettlement subsidy.
Q) Livelihood support
The status-changed persons may enjoy the basic endowment insurance and minimum subsistence
allowance for urban residents. Those who have secured basic endowment insurance and have
actually paid the premium for 15 years and longer may receive endowment insurance money on a
monthly basis after they have reached the age of 60 years (for men) and 55 years (for women). In
Bishan County, the minimum subsistence allowance is paid RMB1451month, which is more than
their average annual income of RMB600 from farming.
For those villagers who have chosen to get resettled by receiving monetary compensation and
whose families include surplus labourers, the village committee will provide them with training on
agricultural production technology, and help them restructure their farming business to improve
income, such as developing greenhouse vegetable planting using the advantage of being close to

Motorcycles Co. and Bicheng Knitting Mill. The ordinary workers in these enterprises receive a
salary of RMB600-1,200. The township and enterprises and private businesses in Bicheng
Township provide 3,000-4,000 jobs each year, including cleaners, cargadors and construction
workers. According to the survey, the average monthly salary of the ordinary workers in the local
enterprise is about RMB500-600. By acquisition such measures, the farmers' income will increase
as the enterprises keep growing so that it will not be lower than it was before land acquisition or

CHONGOING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGOING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
At present, the ongoing urban construction and enterprises now in operation and those under
construction in the development zones may provide a great number of job opportunities for the
affected people (See TABLE 6-20). It consists of the machine-building centre that integrates the
functions of development, production and sales and West-China Shoemaking Park that integrates
the functions of shoemaking, technical information provision, and technical training and product
distribution.
The Park Area covers a total space of 11.4 km2 of which 1.4 km2 is used as the start-up zone, 1.98
km2 as the expansion zone and the rest as far-future planning zone. The planned target of this park
area is to finish constructing 6 km2 of it within 5 years (from 2003 to 2007) to introduce 120
enterprises that produces high value-added products and are relatively large in size. The total
investment of these enterprises will amount up to RMB4 billion with an annual output value of over
RMB15 billion. In five years time, these enterprises are expected to generate a total tax revenue of
RMB1.2 billion, or at least RMBO.4 billion by 2007 and employ 70,000 people.
Currently, altogether 22 industrial enterprises have been introduced into this park area, covering a
total space of 2,417.26 mu, of which 406,000 m2 of houses have been constructed with a total
construction investment of RMB81.574 million. The designed total output value of the completed
space is RMB4.79591 billion, meaning every square kilometre of the area will generate a yield of
RMB2.97883 billion. Up to the end of November 2003, the park has turned out an output of
RMBI1.79623 billion and tax revenue of RMB52.11 million, employing more than 6,000 people. So
far, construction of the 1.4 km2 start-up area has finished and 19 enterprises has moved into it,
including 8 that have been in operation such as JINGUAN AUTOS and HONGYU PRECISION
MACHINES, 4 that will get into operation such as the ZONGZAO THREE WHEELERS and 7 that
are under construction such as the SHUANGXING GROUP.

6.6.2 RESTORATIONREHABILITATION OF TEMPORARY LAND OCCUPATION
The temporary occupation of land for this project involves 26 mu of land Crop compensation for
land temporarily occupied will be paid in such as manner that the loss in one year of occupation will
be compensated for as 2.5 quarters, which means a total sum of compensation money of
RMB2,500. Constructing the project will occupy the land for about one year and the compensation
obtained is much higher than the actual loss as the average annual output value of the farmland is
only RMB1, 200 per mu. Therefore, the farmers' livelihood will not be affected.
After the project is completed, the affected choose how to restore the land. The constructor re-
cultivates the farmland occupied and returns it to the affected; village and group organize to check
and accept.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
6.6.3 RESETTLEMENT OF RURAL RESIDENTS
Altogether 4,193.49 m2 of rural residential houses will be demolished for constructing this project.
The resettled residents will be resettled by monetary compensation (the standard being
RMB270/m2 for brick+concrete structure houses, RMB220/m2 for brick+wood structure houses,
RMB150/m2 for earth+wood structure houses, and RMB60 for simple structure houses). The
affected people receiving the compensation money have three alternatives to make, namely, to
construct their own houses, purchase cheap resettlement houses, and purchase commercial
houses. In the former case, the resettlement agency shall pay compensation to the owner of the
house demolished and at the same time provide him free of charge with a house site. In the latter
two cases, the resettlement agency shall pay the affected household compensation not only for the
house demolished but also the house site taken.
(1) For those who choose to build their own houses, the local government shall provide free of
charge house sites at the space rate of 3Dm2 per person. The demolisher is responsible for
smoothing the ground and providing water and power supplies to the affected households. The
resettled persons may choose to build multi-story houses with the ground floor used as a shop
for business. It is known through survey that the resettled persons can perfectly build houses of
the same area as their former houses in the resettlement area with the compensation money
received.
(2) The resettled persons may choose to buy resettlement houses provided by the government at
a reduced price. They may buy such houses at the price equivalent to the compensation and at
the space standard of 18m2 per person. For limitation of design, the excessive space is to be
purchased at a rate 50% as much as the he combination price (construction cost and land price
included) if it is not more than 5m2 and if the space is in excess of 5m2 but less than the space
of the former house demolished, it is may be purchased at the combination price. Any part
exceeding the space of the former house demolished is to be purchased at the price of
commercial houses. The demolisher is responsible for smoothing the ground and providing
water, power and gas supplies to the affected households.
(3) For families who are not willing to purchase houses provided at a preferential price or built their
own houses on sites provided free, they might use the compensation money received to
purchase commercial houses in the city. As they will be compensated for house sites at the
space rate of 3Dm2 per person at the price of RMB300/m2, the compensation enables them to
buy new or second-hand houses in Bishan County seat.
(4) Those who purchase commercial houses in Tongliang County will be exempted from all the
purchase fees and taxes. See TABLE 6.22 for information about the supply of new commercial
houses and second-hand houses in Bishan County. Many of the second-hand house buildings
in Bishan County are houses left by enterprises and institutions. They are relatively convenient
in location and good in quality and structure. Furthermore, those who choose to get resettled
by monetary compensation and purchase commercial houses in Bishan County will be
exempted from all the purchase fees and taxes. See TABLE 6-21 for information about the
supply of new commercial houses and second-hand houses.

According to the general plan of Chongqing municipality, Bicheng Township will be the traffic gate
in the west and a small industrial and commercial city chiefly for farm product processing and
distribution. By 2020, the population will be 150,000 in the township and 13.16 km2 of land is
planed for construction with per-capita space of 87 m2 . The uniform        resettlement houses and
resettlement area are located in the new urban area of Bicheng Township and complete with
various supplementary facilities and well-developed transport and communication systems. The
newly built houses are better in structure and quality and the resettled residents will feel more
convenient in daily life, work and their children's schooling than before. Their living standard and
quality of life will be much improved. Through discussions with the affected rural residents, more
than 90% of them are willing build their own houses.
6.6.4 RESETTLEMENT OF ENTERPRISES AND INSTITUTIONS
This project will affect 101 people in 8 enterprises.
See TABLE 6-22 for the resettlement of the affected enterprises and institutions. The two concrete
slab-casting yards, cotton mill and Datong Machinery Plant choose to get resettled by monetary
compensation and rebuild the houses themselves. Shuren College whose office, classroom and
dormitory buildings will be demolished will rebuild them on a new location near the original site and
reconstruction will be arranged during the vacation to minimize causing impact on the normal
operation of the college. In either case, the land price for these enterprises will be compensated for
at the evaluated actual price.
The enterprises or institutions whose enclosure wall and pump house are demolished may use the
compensation to rebuild them.

RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
The affected enterprises and institutions will be exempted from any taxes and fees during
resettlement and recovery. The rights and interests of the workers in the enterprise, institution and
shops will not be affected during resettlement, which include salary, medical care, social security,
dividend, bounty, etc. and measures will be acquired to ensure that they do not lose their jobs due
to resettlement. The workers of Xinta Concrete Slabs Casting Yard and Concrete Slabs Casting
Yard are almost migrant workers. The project executing agent will inform these migrant workers 2
months before land acquisition takes place to allow enough time for them to get reemployed. The
employees in Farm Supplies Company will continue working in new site. The affected one worker
in Pump station of Fuji Machinery Plant will still work in the plant.

These vulnerable groups will be affected by land acquisition, none of which choose to get resettled
by changing status. The land compensation money and reseKtlement subsidy may be paid to their
children who take the responsibility for arranging their livelihood. Meanwhile, free technical training
will be offered to their children to help them develop agricultural production so that they can get
more income. Vocational training, information about employment and guidance will be offered the
labourers in the vulnerable group's families to increase their chance of getting employed.
6.7 PROJECT IN WULONG COUNTY
The project will acquire 395.75 mu of land for permanent use and 30 mu of land for temporary use,
affecting 12 people in 4 rural households, 6 people in 1 urban household, 28 people in 3
enterprises, and 12 people in 2 shops. Altogether 3,495m2 of houses will be demolished, affecting
697 people in 216 households, and 544 people need to be resettled by production.
6.7.1 REHABILITATION OF PERMANENT LAND ACQUISTION

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
From TABLE 6-24, it can be seen that this project has no significant impact on the four villages
because only a small percentage of farmland will be acquired. Of the four villages, Zitong Village is
affected most. Altogether 64.5 mu of land is acquired; accounting for 15% of the total space, and
159 persons are affected of whom 143 need to be resettled by production. The per-capita space of
farmland is 0.38 mu after acquisition, down by 1 .6%. The average annual yield of farmland in the
village is RMB500 per mu and land acquisition will reduce this figure by RMB8. As the per-capita
net income of the village was RMB2, 356, Apparently, the project has no significant impact on the
four villages by land acquisition and just as the land acquired accounts for only a small part of the
total area of farmland, the impact of land acquisition on the farmer's income is thus quite limited.
According to the survey, all the farmland to be acquired is within the flood-affected area and thus
either seeding or harvesting will be significantly affected each year. After the embankment is
completed, part of the farmland originally affected by flood but not acquired will have a better yield.
Therefore land acquisition of the project has no significant impact on the local residents.
6.7.1.2   REHABILITATION OF INCOME
1.   Resettlement plan
As all the four affected villages are located in the planned area for construction of the county seat,
the land will be acquired gradually in the coming 5-10 years during the ongoing urbanization
process. Therefore, resettlement of the affected villagers may take the form of changing status
depending on the actual condition and villagers' willingness. The status-changed persons will
receive a total amount of RMB16,000 as land compensation and resettlement subsidy.
2.    Monetary compensation
For those affected farmers who are willing to remain in the rural area to contact land for farming
rather than having their status changed, the project-executing agency will make compensation
according to the space of land taken. Each mu of land taken can be compensated for RMB45,000.
Based on the current deposit interest rate 2.79% above 5 years, excluding tax on interest rate 20%,
the real deposit rate is 2.232%. If the affected deposit the compensation RMB34,850 in the bank
for 50 years, they will get about RMB1,497 each year, which is much more than their current yearly
net income RMB600 from cultivated land.
The four affected villages will get a total amount of RMB8.913 million as land compensation and
resettlement subsidy.
3.   Livelihood support
The status-changed persons may enjoy the basic endowment insurance and minimum subsistence
allowance for urban residents. Those who have secured basic endowment insurance and have
actually paid the premium for 15 years and longer may receive endowment insurance money on a
monthly basis after they have reached the age of 60 years (for men) and 55 years (for women). In
Bishan County, the minimum subsistence allowance is paid at the rate of RMB145/month.
For those villagers who have chosen to get resettled by receiving monetary compensation and
whose families include surplus labourers, the village committee will provide them with training on
agricultural production technology and help them restructure their farming business to improve
income, such as developing greenhouse vegetable planting using the advantage of being close to
the urban area.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
The local government will establish a complete labour service system to provide assistance to the
affected villagers such as providing them with information on employment, vocational training,
consultation with the local enterprises, etc. to pave the way for them to get employed.
According to a survey of the income level of status-changed persons in Wulong County in the past
three years, the average annual income of those engaged in the secondary and tertiary industries
in the city will be about RMB5,000 to 6,000 by 2005, which is much higher than it used to be
before resettlement.
6.7.2 REHABILITATION OF TEMPORARY LAND OCCUPATION
Temporary land acquisition will affect three villages. Altogether 30 mu of land will be acquired for
temporary use, including 17 mu of collectively owned land. The temporary occupation of farmland
will necessitate the compensation for loss of crops. As the farmland will be acquired for one year
and two growing seasons will be affected which will be compensated for as 2.5 seasons, each mu
of farmland may receive a crop compensation of RMB2,500. If calculated in terms of the annual
yield of farmland in one year, the temporary occupation of land will bring about a loss of RMB1,500
per mu. The compensation is thus more than the actual loss of the farmland. This means that the
villagers' livelihood will not be affected.
The temporarily acquired land will be restored and returned to the village by the constructor.
6.7.3 RESETTLEMENT OF URBAN RESIDENTS
This project will involve the demolition of 1,450m2 of residential houses including 380m2 of urban
residences and 1,070m2 of rural residences, affecting 18 persons in 5 households. The urban
resettled persons may receive monetary compensation at the rate of RMB450/m2 (land prices
included)for brick+concrete structure houses, and the rural resettled persons may receive
RMB270/m2 for brick+concrete structure houses (including land price). They may, at their option,
purchase houses in the urban area at a reduced price.
Those who purchase commercial houses in Wulong County seat will benefit from a preferential
policy that allows them to buy a space of 18m2 per person at the compensation price. For limitation
of design, the excessive space is to be purchased at a rate 50% as much as the combination
cost(construction cost and land prices included)if it is not more than 5m2 and if the space is in
excess of 5m2 but less than the space of the former house demolished, it is may be purchased at
the combination price. Any part exceeding the space of the former house demolished is to be
purchased at the price of commercial houses.
Those who are not willing to purchase cheap resettlement houses may use their compensation to
buy commercial or second-hand houses in the urban area. See TABLE 6-25 for information about
the supply of houses for resettlement.
There is only one urban residence to be resettled. The owner of the residence has another house
and the residence in question is currently being rented by other people. The tenant of the residence
will be offered, 3 months before demolishing the house, information about the vacancy of houses
and help in finding the house and during movement. The owner of the house will be paid of
monetary compensation for the house as well as for the loss of rent for a period of 6 month at the
rate of RMB300 per month. Compensation will also be made for the damage of telephone line,
cable TV and other facilities and allowances for movement, transition and installation of water and
power supplies will be provided. As this family has a residence in the urban area, they may use this
sum of compensation money to continue doing business or purchase houses in the urban area to
let out.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
6.7.4 RESETTLEMENT OF RURAL RESIDENTS
For constructing this project, four rural residential houses will be demolished. The displace persons
may receive compensation at the rate of RMB270/m2 for brick+concrete structure houses and
RMB180/m2 for earth+wood structure houses.
The Changtu River improvement component will affect one family, whose land will be acquired and
house demolished. The family includes two adults and one child. They make a living by doing small
business in a rented shop in the urban area. Currently their income comes mainly from business
and has little reliance on land. As the project-executing agency will pay them compensation for
house site at the space rate of 3Om3 per person at the price of RMB150/m2, the compensation they
receive will enable them to buy new or second-hand houses in the city. So after moving into the
city, their living standard will not degrade and their work, livelihood and their child's schooling will
become even more convenient. The other three families will not be affected by land acquisition.
Except the one to be demolished, Chen Honglin's family has another house measuring about
500m2 in floor space nearby. Though consultation, the family is willing to get resettlement by
monetary compensation. Chen Jianming's family includes two adults and one child and they
currently make a living by working for others. Through consultation, they are willing to get resettled
by monetary compensation. With this sum of money they can purchase a new or second-hand
house in the city at a cheap price. Tan Chunpo's family consists of four members. The family
makes a living by working for others. After their house is demolished, they are willing to get
resettled by receiving monetary compensation. Similarly, they can use this sum of money to
purchase a new or second-hand house in the urban area. As this family has difficulty getting
employed in the city, they will be provided with assistance such as giving free technical training to
the two labourers in the family so that they can find jobs in the city. In this way their living standard
can be restored to at least the former level.
From TABLE 6-25, it can be seen that the residential centres now being developed in Wulong
County seat can provide houses of various spaces and internal structure types. These residential
centres are normally complete with facilities and convenient transport system. There are also an
ample supply of second-hand houses in the city, most of which are house buildings of local law
courts, banks, power supply company, Xinhua book store and other institutions. These houses are
still good in quality and structure and are located in areas with convenient transportation. They are
available in different internal structures for the resettled persons to choose from. Therefore, after
moving into the city, the resettled residents will expect a considerable improvement in living
standard and quality.

6.7.5 RESETTLEMENT OF ENTERPRISES
The project will affect three enterprises with 2,045 m2 of houses to be demolished.
See TABLE 6-26 for the resettlement of the affected enterprises. After receiving the monetary
compensation, the enterprises may decide whether or not to reconstruct their houses. The concrete
slab yard has not been in operation for years and reconstruction is out of the question. The tobacco
re-drying plant may use the compensation fund to renovate the existing empty houses into
dormitory for the migrant workers and therefore reconstruction is unnecessary. The material
recovery company may use the compensation fund to rebuild houses on another site provided free
by the planning department of the local government. These enterprises will get compensation for
economic losses caused by resettlement because they will receive compensation not only for the
loss of houses but also for the loss of land. Resettlement of the material recovery company in
another place will be arranged as early as possible to enable early reconstruction and
rehabilitation.

6.7.6 RESETTLEMENT OF SHOPS
The project will affect 12 persons in 2 shops. They will receive a compensation of RMB45,000.
Both shops are run on rent. Since the construction of the project will cause the shops to temporarily
stop operation, the demolisher will, three months before construction of the project, provide the
renters with other houses including shops in similar location and at similar rate of rent and help
them find the houses and arrange operation. Moreover, the owner of the two shops will be paid
compensation for rent losses of one year at the rate of RMB20, 000. The duration of compensation
is 10 months in principle but may be adjusted according to the actual time of impact.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGOING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
There are many shops by Fuzian Road, Furong Road and Jiangshe Dong Road for the resettled
ship-owners to choose from. The annual rent rate of these shops is similar to that of the existing
ones, which is about RMB20, 000. The demolisher should help the renters to move before
* construction so as not to affect their business operation and should pay them movement allowance
at the rate of RMB1 5/mi.
6.7.7 REHABILITATION OF VULNERABLE GROUPS
The project office has also surveyed the vulnerable groups to be affected by the project. while
conducting the socio-economic survey (See next Table). This project will affect 11 families of the
vulnerable group, which include 4 families having handicapped person(s), 2 families consisting
mainly of women and 5 families consisting of old people living alone. All of these families will be
affected by land acquisition. Their source of income includes rental money earned from alienating
or letting out collectively owned land paid to each family member and the compensation paid by the
township government and village leadership. The total sum of the two amounts is about
RMB200/month. From the finding of the survey, it can be seen that the land to be acquired by the
project from the vulnerable group is not significant in space and, since the farmland in the land-
acquisition area will be flooded each year and original yield of the farmland is already subject to the
impact of flood, land acquisition actually has no major impact on the income of the affected people.

For this project, the vulnerable group will be affected by land acquisition. Some of them     will be
resettled by changing status.
Those people of the vulnerable group who would like to have their status changed will be included
in the urban social security system. The qualified ones may enjoy the basic urban endowment
insurance, medical insurance, unemployment insurance and minimum subsistence support
(RMB115 per person/month). On the other hand, the land compensation and resettlement subsidy
may be paid to their children or the public welfare bureau or rest house and the latter will take care
of them in their daily lives. Meanwhile the labourers in their families will be provided with vocational
training and information and instructions on employment so that they have better chance of
employment.

RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
For those vulnerable people not to change status, the land compensation money and resettlement
subsidy may be paid to their children who take the responsibility for arranging their livelihood.
Meanwhile, free technical training will be offered to their children to help them develop agricultural
production so that they can get more income.
6.7.8 REHABILITATION OF AFFECTED INFRASTRUCTURE AND GROUND ATTACHMENTS
'The affected infrastructure and ground attachments will be restored by their respective owners after
being compensated for by the project owner. Of these facilities, the cell phone relay tower, high
and low voltage power lines and other special faculties will be built in other locations before
demolishing the existing ones so as not to affect the livelihood of the residents and operation of the
enterprises, institutions, and shops nearby.
6.8 PROJECT IN JIANGJIN CITY
The project will acquire 12.36 mu of land for permanent use and 101.71 mu for temporary use,
affecting 279 people in 79 households and 19 people need to be resettled by production.
6.8.1 REHABILITATION OF PERMANENTLY LAND ACQUISITION
6.8.1.1    ANALYSIS OF IMPACT
This project will acquire 12.36 mu of land for permanent use, affecting 126 persons in 39
households in 4 villages. As the total space of land to be acquired is relatively small with the per-
capital space of land decreasing only by 0.001 mu, land acquisition will have no significant impact
on the villagers (See TABLE 6-28).

According to the field survey, of the affected villagers, Gong Yong's family in Luopan Village is
affected the most by land acquisition with 1.2 mu of farmland to be acquired. The four-member
family has a total space of farmland of 3.68 mu with a monthly income of RMB1,500. The male
labourers of the family often go out to work as migrant workers and get a relatively stable income
annually. The female labourers stay at home farming. There is still a space of 2.48 mu of farmland
left after acquisition. As the yield of land in the area is poor, they are willing to get resettled by
receiving monetary compensation rather than reallocation of land. Yuan Zhongwen's family in
Taping Village receives the least impact of land acquisition with only 0.03 mu of land acquired. The
four-member family has a total space of farmland of 1.85 mu with a monthly income of RMB1,200.
'Land acquisition will produce no impact on their living standard.

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
Also according to the survey, a majority of villagers in these two villages are working locally or
elsewhere as migrant workers. Land acquisition actually has no practical impact on their income.
6.8.1.2   REHABILITATION OF INCOME
1    Resettlement plan
Unsatisfied with the low yield of farmland, the villagers affected by permanent land acquisition are
unwilling to get resettled by relocation of land. A consensus has been reached through consultation
that they will be resettled by receiving monetary compensation. According to the rates of
compensation, the two villages will get a total amount of RMB310,000 as land compensation and
resettlement subsidy. At the consent of a majority of 2/3 of the affected villagers, the land
compensation and resettlement subsidy will be paid to the affected labourers according to the
space of land acquired. Thus, each of the affected labourers can get a total of RMB16,379 with the
land compensation and resettlement subsidy putting together.
Each mu can be compensated RMB 25,184. Based on the current deposit interest rate 2.79%
above 5 years, excluding tax on interest rate 20%, the real deposit rate is 2.232%. If the affected
deposit the compensation RMB25, 184 in the bank for 50 years, they will get about RMB837 each
year, which is more than their current yearly net income RMB492 from cultivated land.
After receiving the compensation money, they may grow cash crops on the remaining space of
farmland and enlarge the scale of animal husbandry. Therefore, it is quite possible that their
livelihood can be restored to the former level.
2.    Livelihood support
The following arrangements will be made to resettle the labourers in the affected villages:
(1) The local government agencies will discuss with the nearby enterprises to persuade them to
give priority to employing the affected villagers. There are seyeral major enterprises in the
affected area such as Tiantian Printing Co. Ltd. which generates an annual output of RMB10
million, Jingu Xinxing Machinery Plant, which runs import and output business in container
connecting bolts, and a liquor production and sales base. Now the Shuangfu Industrial Park
Area is acquisition shape, where 25 enterprises has moved in, introducing a total investment of
RMB430 million. Of these enterprises, Chongqing Meike Motor Technology Co. Ltd. with a total
investment of RMB200 million is now clearing the site for constructing its houses, Chongqing
Ruili Machine Manufacturing Co. Ltd. has already been in operation, Chongqing Changgu
Industrial & Trading Co. is now constructing its workshops, etc. After the water supply project is
completed, more and more enterprises will be attracted into the industrial park area.
Doubtlessly this will promote employment in the project area. The affected local villagers may
take part in the construction of these enterprises. Unskilled villagers will be provided with
vocational training. It is found from the survey that the average income level of the ordinary
workers in the local enterprises is within RMB500-600. As the enterprises grow in business,
the farmers working in these enterprises can expect a growth in income.
(2) With the execution of the water supply project, the constructor will give priority to employing the
local labourers to take part in the civil works. As most of the villagers have worked in
construction companies as masons, carriers, reinforcement bar binders, they are highly
experienced in doing such specialized jobs.
(3) A monitoring mechanism will be established to ensure that the resettled persons get properly
resettled and compensated so that their production and livelihood will not be lower than the
level before resettlement.

CHONGOING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
6.8.2 REHABILITATION OF TEMPORARY LAND OCCUPATION
The project will take 101.7 mu of land for temporary use, affecting 10 villages in one township.
Through consultation with the local villagers, it is agreed that compensation for temporary
occupation of land will be made in such as way that the loss of yield in one farming season will be
compensated for as if it were in two farming seasons at the rate of RMB900 per mu for loss of
crops and RMB1, 200 for loss of fishes. Since the land temporarily acquired will undergone
operations such as trench excavation, pipe laying and backfilling, it is known that the constructor
will carry out the excavating and backfilling operations section by section along the alignment and
each section of land will be restored in no longer than one month. This arrangement will reduce the
impact of temporary occupation of land to a minimum. To sum up, after receiving compensation,
the livelihood of the residents in the villages will not be adversely affected and can even restore to
the level before land acquisition.
6.8.3 REHABILITATION OF VULNERABLE GROUPS
The project will affect four handicapped people in four families located respectively in Halloo,
Gaohu and Guanghua Villages. According to the survey, Chen Jiezhong's family in Hailuo Village
has 1.41 mu of farmland of which 0.3 mu will be permanently acquired and family's average
monthly income is RMB800. Song Jieren's family in Gaohu Village has 1.9 mu of farmland of which
0.2 mu will be permanently acquired and the family's average monthly income is RMB500. Li Jun's
family in Hailuo Village has 2 mu of farmland of which 0.1 mu will be temporarily acquired and the
family's average monthly income is RMB1,000. Wang Zhouliang's family in Guanghua Village has
1.1 mu of farmland of which 0.4 mu will be temporarily acquired and the family's average monthly
income is RMB1,200. All of them have a stable income from working as migrant workers and only a
small part of their farmland will be acquired. Therefore land acquisition will virtually has little impact
on them. After being properly compensated, their livelihood will restore to the level before land
acquisition.
The two handicapped people's families affected by permanent land acquisition will not only receive
monetary compensation and resettlement subsidy but also be given priority in having the healthy
members of the families settled. For the other two handicapped people's families affected by
temporary occupation of land, the local govemment will consult the constructor to have their land
restored first and pay them the crop compensation. in time. As each of these families also includes
normal members, they will take case of the handicapped ones in the family. According to the
Official Document No. JCN(2003)173, these handicapped people will be exempted from the
agriculture tax, which will further relieve them of financial burden. After receiving the monetary
compensation duly paid to them, they can expect that their living standard will be restored to the
level before land acquisition.
Generally speaking, all measures possible will be acquired to help and support the impoverished
vulnerable group so that their livelihood is restored to the former level and gradually becomes well
off.
6.8.4 REHABILITATION OF INFRASTUCTURE AND GROUND ATTACHMENTS
The project will temporarily take 1,680 m2 of the section between Wenjiadian and Huangjiayuanzi
on the Jin-Ma highway route from July 1, 2004. According to the actual condition, the temporary
passageway will be constructed separately in half the width to avoid blocking the traffic.
Construction will begin five days after acquisition the land and be completed and traffic restored in
two days' time. Meanwhile, compensation will be paid to the highway management agency
according to Article IlIl: "Rates of compensation for Highway Assets in Chongqing" of Annex 1 of
Chongqing Municipal Communication Commission's Official Document No. YJW(2000)325.

The three power line poles affected by the Level II pressurizing pump station will be moved slightly
off the construction site. Thus before constructing the pump station, the switching off and on of
power will be so timed as to avoid the peak hours of power consumption by the local residents. Any
arrangement regarding the use of power will be duly announced to the local residents so as to
minimize the impact caused by switching off of power. After the power line poles are resettled,
construction of the pump station will have no impact on the local residents' livelihood as due to the
interruption of power supply.
For the 855 fruit trees affected by the project, their owners will be compensated at the rate of
RMB45 per piece according to the standard set.
6.9 PROJECT IN BEIBEI DISTRICT
The project will take 23.2 mu of land for permanently use and 8.1 mu of land for temporary use,
affecting 64 persons in 19 villages and 24 persons need to be reseKtled by production.
6.9.1 REHABILITATION OF PERMANENT LAND OCCUPATION
6.9.1.1   ANALYSIS OF IMPACT
The project will permanently take 23.2 mu of land including 19.9 mu of farmland and 3.3 mu of
state-owned land. Of the total space of land acquired, the water purification plant component will
take 17.8 mu and the high-elevation water tank component will take 2.1 mu. This will affect 50
people in two groups of two villages in Dongyang Township, Beibei District and 24 people need to
be resettled by production.

The group has 146 mu of farmeand and a population of 242 persons in 80 families. Before land
acquisition the per-capita space of farmsand is 0.6 mu and it becomes 0.53 mu after land
acquisition. Land acquisition will actually affect 45 persons in 12 families including 21 labourers.
The per-capita income of the village was RMuJB2, 360 in 2003.

CHONGOING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
It is obvious that the project will take a small space of farmland and affect a small number of people
and families. This means each affected family still has sufficient farmland to cultivate. According to
the survey, the family affected most seriously by land acquisition has only 0.3 mu of farmland
acquired and they still have 0.8 mu left. The fact is that the major income of that family is from
secondary and tertiary industries and farming accounts for only an insignificant part of the total
income. As for other families, the land acquired accounts for even a smaller part of the total space.
It is known from the survey that since there are many non-agricultural job opportunities, very few
young labourers are engaged in farming and most of them work, run business or do other things in
the city. Obviously, as the major source of income of the affected labourers is the secondary and
tertiary industries, land acquisition will cause no significant impact on them in terms of income.
6.9.1.2    REHABILITATION OF INCOME
(1) Resettlement plan
Through discussions with Dongyang Township government, project owner, Jingtan Village
committee and affected villagers, it is agreed that all the farmers affected by land acquisition will be
resettled by receiving monetary compensation and the land compensation and resettlement
subsidy will be paid to the affected farmers.
The affected two villages can receive a total amount of RMB580,000 as land compensation and
resettlement subsidy. Each mu can be compensated RMB22,100-29,750. Based on the current
deposit interest rate 2.79% above 5 years, excluding tax on interest rate 20%, the real deposit rate
is 2.232%. If the affected deposit the compensation RMB22, 100-29,750 in the bank for 50 years,
they will get about RMB734-988 each year, which is more than their current yearly net income
RMB550 from cultivated land.
(2) Livelihood support
G As most of the villagers in the project area work, run business or do other things in the
city, the resettlement subsidy will be paid to the affected labourers themselves. This sum
of money will enable them to continue their present careers. The public welfare bureau will
employ technical personnel to train the surplus labourers and arrange them to work in the
nearby enterprises. The jobs available to them are mostly unskilled workers, security
guards, banisters, housekeepers, and cleaners with a wage level of RMB400-600 per
month. See next TABLE 6-30 for the basic facts about the candidate enterprises.

() The project after complete will provide the affected labourers (about 20 of them) with the
following jobs: pipeline repairers, water gauge reading recorders, operators, security
guards, and cleaners. These jobs require no special skill and provide the workers with a
monthly wage of about RMB300-500.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
(I The village committee will use the land compensation to construct infrastructure,
restructure the village's agricultural production, and improve the re-cultivation index of
farmland to restore the yield to the former level.
The ultimate goal of restoring production and improving the livelihood of the affected persons can
be achieved by taking the measures described above to increase the yield of the diminished
farmland and encourage the affected villagers to work outside.
Beibei Silkworm Breeding Farm has 800 mu of state-owned land. As there is no building to be
demolished, the project will have no significant impact on the farm except for a number of mulberry
trees. The project owner will help the farm to restore production by relocating the affected mulberry
trees or make compensation for the loss at the specified standard. Through consultation with
Beibei District National Land Administration Bureau and the breeding farm, the project owner will
compensate the enterprise for the land acquired at the rate of RMB120,000 per mu and RMB36 per
square meter as land alienation fee.
6.9.2 REHABILITATION OF TEMPORARY LAND OCCUPATION
The project will take 8.1 mu of land for temporary use in two villages, which will receive crop
compensation at the specified rate of RMB1, 100 per mu. The project will temporarily occupy the
land for three 3 months (or one quarter and any occupation longer than one quarter to be regarded
as two quarters). If the occupation causes the loss of yield in one quarter, the damage is about
RMB1, 000 per mu, which means that the compensation is more than the actual loss and therefore
the villagers' livelihood will not be affected by temporary occupation of land.
The temporarily acquired land will be restored by the constructor as initially agreed upon between
the affected villages and the project-executing agency. And the village and group organize to check
and accept.
6.9.3 REHABILITATION OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND GROUND ATTACHMENTS
Rehabilitation of demolished facilities must be planned and arranged in advance and carried out in
a safe, efficient, timely and accurate manner to minimize adverse impact on the residents living
nearby.
The resettlement and reconstruction of power poles and lines will be carried out according to the
agreement signed three months before commencement of project construction between the project
owner and the power line owner. As the resettlement and reconstruction of power lines will cause a
certain impact on the enterprises and residents around the project area, the project owner will in
consultation with the power line owner have the standby power poles and lines erected before
moving the existing ones so as to mitigate the impact. The project owner will prepay to the power
line owner part of the cost of resettlement and reconstruction work and final settlement of the cost
will be made by the two parties at the replacement price. The power line owner will do his best to
finish the resettlement and reconstruction before commencement of project construction to
minimize impact. The price quoted by the power line owner takes effect after being appraised by a
disinterested assessment agency.
The affected tractor trails will be reconstructed by the project owner before project construction.
New passageways will be constructed to replace the existing ones, which should be convenient to
the pedestrians so as not to affect the daily life of the villagers.
Other affected ground attachments will be compensated for by the project owner and restored by
their respective owners. Compensation for such ground attachments will be based on the policies
described above, in consideration of the local situation and in compliance with the World Bank
requirements.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
6.10 INTEGRATION WITH HOST RESIDENTS
The residents affected by the project will get resettled in three ways, purchasing uniformly
constructed resettlement houses at a lowered price, building their own houses on sites provided
free by the project owner, and purchasing commercial houses.
In the former two cases, the resettled persons move into the same place and will mingle with one
another fairly easily because they are urban or rural residents from the same district, county or city
and have similar production and living customs and social and cultural background.
For those who purchase commercial houses in the city, they will give due consideration to the need
of work and daily life as well as social relations. The affected urban residents who purchase houses
in places familiar to them will have little problem in integrating with other residents in the area. For
the affected rural residents, they will also be able to mingle with other residents in the residential
area fairly easily because they come from suburban areas close to the city and most of them have
worked in the city and are not unfamiliar with the urban environment.
Through the above analysis, it can be concluded that the residents affected by the project will have
no problem in integration with other residents when they move into the resettlement area.

CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
7 PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
7.1 STRATEGY FOR PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
In compliance with the resettlement policies, laws and regulations issued by the central
government, Chongqing municipal government and local governments of districts, cities and
counties involved, in order to protect the legal rights and interests of the resettled persons and
entities, minimize dissatisfactions and disputes, and develop better policies regarding resettlement
and practical measures as well as resettlement plan in consideration of the nature of the project,
great importance will be attached to the participation of the resettled persons in the whole process
of policy making, plan development and execution of the project.
When conducting the feasible study of the project at the preparation stage, the project office has for
several times solicited the city, district and county governments, local people's congresses, political
consultant conferences, NGOs, affected residents in the project areas and village committees
involved in land acquisition for their comments and suggestions on resettlement.
In August 2003, the project office founded a working team to conduct a quantitative survey on
material impacts of land acquisition and resettlement. All representatives of the affected by the
project participated in the survey. The project office has also solicited the village committees and
resettled person's representatives for comments and held extensive consultations with them. The
survey covered the local socio-economic situation the project-affected areas and psychological
reaction of the public. The survey included door-by-door visits to the local residents to get an
understanding of their attitudes toward resettlement and the project. The extensive concrete
information obtained from the survey helps to lay a solid foundation for developing the resettlement
plan.
In the future, the following procedures and methods will be employed to encourage public
participation and consultation:
(1) Direct participation of the resettled persons in resettlement activities
Delegates will be elected proportionally from the resettled residents to collect public comments and
requirements and suggests in collaboration with the village committee and give regular briefings.
(2) Consultations between the project owner and the resettled persons on ways of resettlement
(3) Holding consultative meetings.
Consultative meetings attended by delegates from the resettled residents, village committees and
women (accounting for at least 30% of the total number of delegates) will be held six months
before land acquisition to brief them on the latest developments and hear their comments and
suggestions.
(4) Holding public conferences
Public conferences will be held three moths before land acquisition and execution of the
resettlement plan to continue to explain to them the related policies, applicable regulations, rates of
compensation and resettlement plans so that they are informed in advance and have enough time
to make arrangement.
(5) Publicizing policies regarding land acquisition on the media
(6) Issuing public notices on land acquisition

CHONGQING MUNICIPALITY - THE WORLD BANK
CHONGQING URBAN ENVIRONMENT PROJECT
RESETTLEMENT ACTION PLAN
The notice will mainly include information on brief introduction to the project, scope of land
acquisition, resettlement policies (including rates of compensation), institutions in charge of
resettlement, resettled rights and obligations, complaints and claims, monitoring and evolution, etc.
(7) Publicizing the resettlement plan
The resettlement plan reviewed and approved by the World Bank will be placed in the municipal
resettlement office and public libraries before the assessment of the project is made and public
announcements will be issued on major local newspapers so that the resettled and NGOs can get
reference to the resettlement plan.
(8) Resettlement information booklet
Before the project is executed, the resettlement office will distribute the resettlement booklets
among the affected villages. The affected residents will then obtain the booklets from the village
committee, which contains detail on project profile, project impacts, polices on compensation,
project executing institution, channel to lodge complaints, etc.
7.2 PUBLIC OPINION SURVEY

resettlement-executing agency, which in turn pays the land compensation and resettlement subsidy
to the affected villages. The crop compensation is paid directly to the affected households. The
village committee distributes the money in different ways of resettlement. The house compensation
is paid by the resettlement-executing agency in separate times to the owner of the house according
to the agreement signed. The compensation for the institutions and enterprises is paid by the
resettlement-executing agency directly to the owners of such institutions and enterprises and the
compensation for infrastructures directly to the owners of such infrastructures. Those copies of
compensation contracts and payment receipts must be kept in the project owner and county PMOs

the whole process of resettlement from the preparation to implementation is placed under internal
monitoring and control.
12.1.1 EXECUTING PROCEDURE
During the execution period, the district, county or city project office and executing agency collect
information about resettlement according to the samples acquired from monitoring and transmits
the record of current activities promptly to the municipal project office to ensure continuous
monitoring of the executing process. The municipal project office then conducts periodic inspection
of the executing process. In the above monitoring mechanism, information registers of a
designated format will be used to keep a continuous flow of information from the villages and rural
or urban townships to the district, county or city project office and the municipal project office.
12.1.2 CONTENT OF MONITORING

depending on their willingness.
* The status-changed farmers affected by land acquisition
may be resettled by monetary compensation, insurance,
social security support, etc 1) Monetary compensation, by
which the land compensation and resettlement subsidy are
paid to the status-changed persons to allow them to make a
living; 2) Resettlement by basic social endowment
insurance, by which those who are above 16 years of age
but have not yet reached the age of retirement specified by
the state government may, by presenting their urban
resident register and ID card, apply for the basic endowment
insurance for urban workers at the local social insurance
agency. Those who have secured this type of insurance and
have actually paid the premium for 15 years and longer may
receive endowrnent insurance money on a monthly basis
after they have reached the age of 60 years for men and 55
years for women. 3) Resettlement by social security
support, by which those status-changed persons may apply
for the minimum urban resident subsistence allowance if the
average income of them and their family members living
together is lower than the minimum local subsistence level
of urban residents. The level of the allowance is determined
according to the cost of clothing, food and shelter necessary
to maintain a decent life for a local urban resident and in
consideration of the cost of water and fuel (coal or gas) and
compulsory schooling of their young children. The prevailing
standard of urban minimum subsistence allowance in the
affected localities are respectively: RMB185/person/month
in Beibei District, RMB145/month in Jiangjin County,
Changshou District, Tongliang County and Bishan County,
RMB115/person/month   in   Wulong    County   and
RMB130/person/month in Dazu County.
*  For those farmers losing farmland, the local government will
establish a complete labour service system to provide
assistance to them. The relevant labour service agency for
the affected people will be founded one month before land
acquisition to help the resettled person get employed
through all possible channels. Such help includes, for
example, giving the status-changed persons free access to
the job market, collecting job information from the local
sources and providing it to the displace persons one month
before land acquisition and then publishing such information
once a month afterwards, providing free vocational training
to the status-changed persons (Such training is mainly
oriented to the demand of the local job market. For instance,
in Dazu County, the training is oriented to the acquisition of
metalworking skills, and in Bishan County, it is oriented to
the acquisition of shoe-making skills, etc.) The labour
service agency will also consult the enterprises being
constructed or seeking expansion and provide them with
certain preferential incentive policies (such as being
exempted from part of tax if they employ the status-changed
persons) in order to make it easier for these persons to get
employed.
Other      a   Compensation for land and resettlement is exempted from
any tax and legal fee

securing related formalities for transferring residence
certificates and changing schools for their children.

Note: The compensation for crops grown in seed-breeding fields designated by the government
may be 30% higher than the rate of compensation for grains. The rate of compensation for
special-purpose fish ponds (including the loss of fishes) is the same as that for vegetables.
Vegetables grown in vegetable-growing areas designated by the government are
compensated for at the same level as vegetables in general. lntercrops are compensated for
as a single type of crop. No separate compensation will be made for separately grown trees
after the compensation calculated according to the rate listed in the table above is made for
crops.
