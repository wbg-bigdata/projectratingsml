CREDIT AND PROJECT SUKNARY
Borrower:           Republic of Guinea-Bissau
Beneficiary:        Junta Autonoma dos Portos da Guine-Bissau (JAPG)
Amount:             SDR 14.9 million (USS16.0 million equivalent)
Terms:              Standard
On-lending Terms:  The Government would on-lend US$1 1.0 million equivalent of
Credit proceeds to JAPG, for 20 years, including 5 years
grace, with interest at 11.0 percent per nnnum, and the
exchanRge risk being borne by JAPG.
Project
Description:        The project would provide technical assistance to the
Ministry of Transport and Tourism (NTT) and the Junta
Autonoma dos Portos da Guine-Bissau (JAPG) and rehabi-
litate and improve port infrastructure and operations.
The main project components are: (a) technical assistance:
gi) to NTT for improvement of transport planning and
management, reorganization of the road and river transport
sector, and operation of a new independent transport com-
pany; and (ii) to JAPG to improve port operations, and to
establish management and accounting systems; (b) civil
works, including rehabilitation of the existing commercial
berth at Bissau port, four river ports and four ferry
ramps, and construction of an office and apartment
building for technical assistance experts and training;
(c) supervision of the construction of a new commercial
quay; and (d) provision of navigation aids.
*     Project Benefits
and Risks:          The major economic benefits of the proposed project would
be savings in ship-time for ocean-going vessels visiting
Bissau port, savings in time spent in port by the fishing
fleet, savings in river transport cost through reduced
turnaround time of barges, avoidance of traffic diversion
to more expensive road transport and avoidance of the cost
of removing the existing commercial berth if not
rehabilitated. Unquantified project benefits will result
from improved transport sector planning, better allocation
of traffic between modes and more efficient port
operations and management.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AID RECONKMEDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT CREDIT
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA-BISSAU
FOR THE BISSLU PORT PROJECT
1.       I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
Development Credit to the Republic of Guinea-Bissau for an amount in various
currencies equivalent to Special Drawing Rights 14.9 million (US$16.0 million
equivalent) on standard IDA terms to help finance the Bissau Port Project.
.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.       The latest economic report on Guinea-Bissau (3529-GUB), dated May 21,
1982, has been circulated to the Executive Directors. The following assess-
ment of the current situation and prospects of the economy is based on the
conclusions of that report and updated figures provided by U.N. sources.
Country data appear in Annex I.
The Setting
3.       Guinea-Bissau is a small nation of about 810,000 inhabitapts (1982)
located on the West African coast between Senegal and Guinea. Together with
th2 Archipelago of Bijagos, the country covers an area of 36,135 km2 (13,938
mi ). The territory is generally flat with a few hills and a coastline inter-
rupted by six large estuaries which run far inland. Its soils are mostly
alluvial and fertile; rainfall is sufficient for a variety of crops, but the
country is not immne from drought. The society is segmented, with several
ethnic groups. Bissau is the national capital, the countryes largest city,
and its main port.
4.       Guinea-Bissau became independent in 1974 and has since been governed
by the sole political party (PAIGC) as a non-aligned centrally planned eco-
nomy. The Government controls the modern sector of the economy, with a small-
holder sector prevailing in agriculture. Politically, Guinea-Bissau has been
quite stable, despite a major change in the party leadership in late 1980.
5.       Guinea-Bissau's economic situation has been difficult. During the
struggle for independence, part of the limited economic infrastructure was de-
stroyed. The country's administrative capacity was reduced with the exodus of
I/ Parts I and II are substantially the same as in the President's Report
for the Second Petroleum Exploration Promotion Project (P-3404- GUB
dated February 24, 1983) which was approved by the Executive Directors
on March 15, 1983.



-2-
the Portuguese, and it had to depend on international assistance for most
essential .supplies. To rehabilitate and develop the economy, the government
relied on the growth of the public and parastatal sector, but lack of admi-
nistrative experience and unwise investment policies led the country into
serious deficits and external indebtedness. Today, Guinea-Bissau is still
among the poorest countries in the world. GDP per capita is around $200
(1980), life expectancy at birth is 42 years, and three-fourths of the popu-
lation is illiterate.  Safe water is available to only one-tenth of its
people. Waterborne diseases are rampant and mortality rates reach 20 percent
among children.
6.       In spite of this grim situation, the country has a potential for
development in the longer term. With good quality soils and large unculti-
vated areas, agricultural output could adequately meet domestic demand for
foodstuffs and raise export earnings. There are promising indications that
commercial development of petroleum, bauxite and phosphates will be possi-
ble. A small manufacturing sector could evolve based on traditional skills
and local raw materials. Identified resources in fisheries (200 km of conti-
nental plateau) and forestry (65% of the national territory) could generate
substantial foreign exchange in the medium term and provide the basis for a
small manufacturing sector.
Structure of the Economy
7.       Agriculture is the most important resource of Guinea-Bissau.  It
accounts for 41% of GDP, most of the country's employment, and 60% of goods
exports. The sector is basically subsistence-oriented, producing rice (the
main staple), sorghum and millet; agricultural exports are mainly groundnuts
and palm kernels. Performance has been poor owing to lack of incentives, in-
adequate infrastructure, and unfavorable weather conditions. Agricultural
value added has actually declined, leading to increased food imports and a
drop in official exports. An overvalued exchange rate (since 1978, the
Guinean peso has been pegged to the SDR, while in the same period the main
trade partners have devalued by around 20-25%) and lack of producer incentives
have contributed to smuggling of export crops as well as some food crops (e.g.
rice) which are produced in the country. Project assistance in agriculture
has been provided by the European Development Fund, the Swedish International
Development Authority and the United States Agency for International Develop-
ment. Its results, although limited in scope, have been satisfactory in terms
of increased productivity and crop diversification.
8.       The fisheries sector is still far from being fully developed, and its
contribution to GDP is only about 2%. The sector's evolution has been based on
(a) the establishment of joint ventures (with the USSR, Algeria, and Senegal
and France) to handle the capture and marketing of fish products; and (b) pro-
vision, through bilateral agreements, of licenses for foreign boats to operate
in Guinean territorial waters. Industrial production is currently about 1,000t
per year (supplemented by about 4,000t from artisanal fishing), compared to an
estimated potential of 300,000 tons per year. However, catches of foreign
boats are substantial, having reached 80,000 tons in 1980. The government is
taking steps to resolve the problems encountered by the joint ventures and to
improve artisanal output by providing fishermen with improved equipment and
adequate marketing support.



-3-
9.       With 65% of its territory covered by forests, Guinea-Bissau has a
good potential for forestry development. However, of an estimated potential
output of 120,000 tons of timber per year, only 8,500 tons are now produced
(2,500 tons for export). The sector is managed by a state-owned company which
is receiving SIDA assistance to improve its management and diversify its
activities.
10.      The industrial sector is still undeveloped (10% of GDP), comprising
some old plants for hulling rice and groundnuts, a few bakeries, some icemak-
ing units, and several repair shops for transportation equipment. Modern
*      plants include a large brewery, an assembly plant for Citroen cars, a ground-
nut processing plant, and several units which were created during 1975-79. The
industrial sector was the most affected by the lack of planning and project
evaluation capacity in the years immediately after independence. At present,
most industrial units work at 30% capacity, hampered by insufficient imported
raw materials and spare parts, and lack of adequate management and trained
workers. Of some 35 public and mixed enterprises, only one showed a profit in
1981.
11.      Transport infrastructure is a major constraint on development.  The
North is served by roads in need of repair and rehabilitation, a situation
being remedied by an on-going IDA-assisted project. The rice growing region in
the South, with the most promising agricultural potential for domestic con-
sumption, is badly served. Inland ports and feeder roads are equally poor. The
port of Bissau, which handles most of the country's foreign trade, has inade-
quate facilities. Its commercial berth is rapidly deteriorating and its navi-
gation aid system needs major rehabilitation. Transport operations, equally
divided between road and river, is inefficient due to inadequate sector orga-
nization, monopolies of public enterprises, and poor truck and barge opera-
tions.
Recent Developments
12.      Economic growth in Guinea-Bissau has been disappointing.  After a
modest growth of about 3.0% p.a. during 1975-79, real CDP appears to have
declined by about 5% in 1980. Agricultural production was affected by rainfall
shortages, and industrial output declined owing to the lack of imported
supplies (raw materials, intermediate goods, fuels, spare parts), constrained
by shortages of foreign exchange. This trend continued in 1981.
13.      The current difficult situation of Guinea-Bissau stems from policies
followed after independence. Despite substantial international assistance,
inadequate aid management led to a mushrooming of projects, many of them ill-
conceived, and to a dispersion and overlapping of efforts. Investment financed
from abroad was high (20-25% of GDP), but until 1980 most of it was allocated
to infrastructure and the social sectors. The rural sector lacked investment
and production incentives. Consequently, agricultural output was sluggish,
with foodstuffs unable to meet domestic demand, and exports insufficient to
generate foreign exchange for satisfying the demand for imported consumer
goods and providing inputs to the modern sector. Farmers, already hurt by the
overvalued currency and export taxes, lacked incentives to increase output.
Capital flows, althougn large, covered only part of the current account defi-
cit, so that foreign reserves declined drastically and net foreign assets have
been negative since 1978. Meanwhile, the role of the public sector grew well



-4-
beyond domestic financial capacity, with the result that bank credit financed
around 50% of budget current outlays.
14.      The new Government (in office sinze 1981) is committed to remedying
the major economic disequilibria while rerewing emphasis on agricultural
development. Lts announced intentions are promising: to curb the public
financial deficits, adjust the official Guinean peso exchange rate, reorganize
the state trading sector, give greater prominence to private enterprise in the
distribution sector, revise the structure of farmgate prices, and strengthen
project selection criteria.
15.      Preliminary data for 1981 indicate that some steps have been taken in
the direction outlined above. For the first time since 1975, agriculture pro-
jects had the highest share in the public inivestment program. The current bud-
get posture improved slightly and public investment was halved. The current
budget deficit was still at a high 15% of GDP and bank credit continued to
finance this deficit and part of the investment outlays. Growth in money sup-
ply decelerated from 70% in 1980 to 13% in 1951.
16.      Guinea-Bissau's external payments position remains difficult. Between
1977 and 1980, imports of goods and services (mainly capital goods and food-
stuffs) grew three times faster than exports, leading to a resource balance
equal to 30% of GDP. In spite of substantial capital inflows and foreign
grants (averaging US$28 million and US$31 million respectively) overall defi-
cit reached US$8 million in 1980. In 1981 the situation improved; imports
were kept constant and exports of palm and fish products increased by 20%.
Net inflows of medium and long-term capital continued to grow, partly to cover
the growing debt service which reached US$10.1 million in 1981, or about 70%
of exports. At end-1981, external debt was at US$102 million (US$169 million
including undisbursed); payment difficulties had increased and arrears on
medium and long-term loans were estimated at US$18.4 million (US$41 million
including arrears on short-term loans and suppliers credits). Help from the
INF was provided in 1981 (an SDR 1.9 million compensatory financing facility),
and from Portugal in 1982 under bilateral assistance.
17.      Guinea-Bissau's government has shown an encouraging recognition of
past errors in economic policies, and a convincing commitment to rehabilitate
the nation's economy, but the legacy of a heavy investment program, large
borrowing on unsuitable terms, and other unwise policies is now being felt.
An IMF mission visited Bissau in March 1983 to help prepare a sound program of
financial rehabilitation and exp-ore means to improve the difficult external                 x
payments situation. The Government has also requested the UNDP to organize a
donors conference in 1983, for which the public investment program is being
reviewed.
18.      The recovery will be difficult in spite of the Government's commit-
ment. A consisten' policy to expand exports is urgently required. The neces-
sary devaluation will require political courage. To support the efforts of
this young nation to place its economy on a sound footing, heavy inflows of
external assistance are now required. In view of the country's extremely
limited fiscal capacity, and its high debt service burden, external project
financing will need to cover a large share of project costs and non-project
financing would be desirable. External capital assistance will have to be
provided on very soft terms.



-5-
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN GUINEA-BISSAU
19.      The number of IDA operations relative to that of other official
development agencies is modest, largely due to the high level of existing aid
flows. At mid-1982, IDA commitments accounted for 9% of total external debt
outstanding, including undisbursed.
20.      IDA's first operation in Guinea-Bissau was a US$9.0 million credit
(Cr. No. 878-GUB of February 9, 1979) to finance a Roads Project which pro-
vides for the rehabilitation and maintenance of 226 km of asphalt roads and
338 km of gravel roads, the purchase of equipment, materials and spare parts,
and technical assistance and training. This credit was supplemented in January
1980 by an EEC Special Action Credit of US$1.0 million which is being applied
primarily to finance local costs of the project. IDA's secbnd operation in
Guinea-Bissau was a US$6.8 million credit (Cr. No. 1095-GUB of January 13,
1981) to finance exploration promotion in the petroleum sector, followed by a
credit of US$ 13.1 million for a second petroleum exploration promotion pro-
ject approved on March 15, 1983.
21.      Future IDA operations in Guinea-Bissau in the medium term will con-
tinue to assist in the rehabilitation of its infrastructure. Reviews of the
development needs of agriculture and eduction sectors, now in progress, may
open the way for direct participation of IDA in these sectors, to supplement
bilateral aid programs. The Government has also requested technical and
financial assistance to strengthen the key economic ministries, and to revi-
talize some of the country's troubled public enterprises.
PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
The Transport System
22.      Most domestic and international traffic flows through Bissau and its
port, although small amounts of goods are transported by land to and from
neighboring Senegal. River transport accounts for 52% of tonnage, mainly in
the south, while road transport accounts for the remaining 48%, primarily in
the north and east. Except for international passenger traffic, air transport
is negligible. The distribution among modes of transport is appropriate, based
on economic transport costs.
23.      Road System.  Guinea-Bissau's road infrastructure eomprises 2,240 km
of roads, of which 427 km are paved. The extent and location of the roads are
acceptable, but maintenance is inadequate and is being improved under on-going
and planned road projects. In the north and east, the road network consists of
trunk roads with modest traffic, and feeder roads for local use. In the south
and west the roads serve mainly as feeders to the river ports, and carry
little traffic.
24.      The first priority in the road sector is the rehabilitation of the
existing network and the reorganization of the inadequate ferry boat system.
This is being addressed under the First Highway project, and will be continued
under the Second Highway project which is under preparation. The ramps for
the main ferries will be rehabilitated under the proposed project.



-6-
25.      Air Transport.  In addition to Bissalanca international airport in
Bissau, the country has 17 landing strips, of which only ten are in good con-
dition. There is little domestic traffic and future expansion is not antici-
pated. The national airline, Linheas Aeireas da Guine-Bissau (LIA), serves all
domestic traffic but less than 25% of international traffic. While LIA is well
run, its development is hampered by maintenance and telecommunications
problems.
Transport Institutions
26.      Public Management in the Sector.  The Ministry of Transport and
Tourism (NTT) is nominally responsible for planning and policy making in the
sector. In practice, however, MTT exercises little effective control. It
exerts virtually no control over the state transport companies and has neither
a national plan for transport nor a clearly stated transport policy. MTT's
organizational problems are compounded by its lack of competent staff. Of its
40 employees, only one has had professional training.
27.      Road user taxes are insufficient (they cover only about 60% of road
infrastructure maintenance costs), and distort competition in favor of the
public sector. The tax structure has been recently improved, with the removal
of tax exemption for the public sector, and the taxation of diesel oil. How-
ever, the average taxation level is still insufficient. The Government has
agreed to carry out, by June 30, 1984, a study on adequate taxation levels to
cover road costs. The conclusions of the study will be discussed with the
Association, and its findings followed up within the framework of the Second
Highway project under preparation. (Section 4.03 of Draft Development Credit
Agreement).
28.      The Transport Companies.  River and road transport are subsidiary
activities of two public trading companies, Armazens do Povo and SOCOMIN,
which share a monopoly on the import and distribution of consumer goods and
agricultural inputs, and the collection of agricultural products in the vil-
lages. Each provides road and river transport; they are the only means of
transport for private commodities. They also own most of the existing trans-
port fleet and have a monopoly on scheduled inter-city road and river ser-
vices. The two companies have major management and operation problems. Their
rate of equipment availability is only 40% and their rate of capacity utili-
zation is only 20%. The service they provide is poor and expensive, a factor
which limits the development of rice, fruit, and vegetable production.
29.      Action Plan for Sector Institution Building. The above issues have
been discussed between the Government and the Association, leading to a deci-
sion to implement major policy changes to strengthen the transport sector's
institutions and improve its operations. Agreement was reached on an Action
Plan for Sector Institution Building (Schedule 4 of Draft Development Credit
Agreement) which includes the following measures:



-7-
(a)  Preparation of a new charter for MTT to strengthen its role in
transport policy definition and implementation, planning, coor-
dination, regulation, and supervision of state enterprises. The
new charter would include the creation, by June 30, 1984, of two
new departments to be responsible for these general areas. The
proposed project provides technical assistance for both depart-
ments and requires the appointment of local counterparts by June
30, 1984;
(b) The transfer of responsibility for transport from the public
trading companies to a new national transport company, so as to
make transport more efficient and subsequently give producers a
choice between this company and independent transporters. The
Government has agreed to the creation of this new company, and a
study in this regard, scheduled for completion by mid-1983, is
being financed by the AfDB. The proposed project includes tech-
nical assistance to the new company for its organization and
initial operations through the provision of five experts in key
positions: Director General, Director of Road Transport, Direc-
tor of River Transport, Director of Finance, each for three
years, and an Administrative Director for two years. Disburse-
ment on this component will be subject to the Government's
presenting an organization plan for the new company acceptable
to the Association (Section 3.06 of Draft Development Credit
Agreement); and
(c) The creation of a transport association by June 30, 1984, under
the control of PTT, with representatives of Government, private
and public transporters, and users, in order to support the
development of an independent transport industry. The transport
association would facilitate access for its members to foreign
exchange for spare parts and fuel and provide MTT with an appro-
priate forum for improving transport regulations.
The Port Authority
30.      The Junta Aut'onoma dos Portos da Guine-Bissau (JAPG), under the
tutelage of the NTT, currently operates without a clearly defined organization
or attributes. Its legal base is a pre-independence statute which has not been
ratified or updated.  JAPG's operations are loosely supervised by MTT.  Within
the framework of the proposed project, the Government has agreed to revise
JAPG's statute and provide it with managerial and financial autonomy. A draft
statute, acceptable to the Associatiou, has been prepared by consultants
financed under an advance from the Project Preparation Facility.
31.      JAPG is responsible for operations at Bissau Port, the only deep-
water port in the country, as well as some twenty river ports. It is also
responsible for cargo handling, equipment and infrastructure maintenance and
repair, and investment in port facilities. Port operations are unstructured
and inefficient. JAPG's staff is not trained and there is virtually no man-
agement information system. As a result, port and cargo operations are not
tightly controlled, and ship movement is not clearly separated from cargo
handling in JAPG's organizational structure. Due to an acute shortage of
qualified staff, infrastructure and equipment maintenance, personnel admin-



-8-
istration, finances, supplies and stores control and technical studies are not
sufficiently developed. A new organization for JAPG will be prepared by June
30, 1985, in consultation with the Association, with the assistance of experts
financed under the proposed project. (Section 2.09 of the Draft Project
Agreement).
32.      JAPG's Reorganization.  To address JAPG's serious management and
technical problems, the Governiaent and the Association have agreed to a number
of actions, which would include the following:
(a) The appointment of five international recruited experts to the
key positions of Director General (also in charge of port opera-
tions), Director of Finance, Director of Cargo Handling and
Storage, Director of Workshops, and Administrative Director.
During their first year, these experts will be fully responsible
for designing JAPG's new organization and management system.
Concurrently, nationa] counterparts will be trained abroad,
financed under the proposed project, who will eventually replace
the expatriates. The proposed project would finance three years
of technical assistance for the management experts (two years
for the Administrative Director). The nomination of counter-
parts acceptable to the Association will be a condition of
disbursement for this component. (Section 2.08 of the Draft
Project Agreement).
(b) The preparation, by January 1, 1985, of a plan to reduce JAPG's
staff by about 300 redundant positions, and its implementation
by December 31, 1985. JAPG currently has some 1,035 staff, 535
permanent employees and about 500 temporary workers. Reducing
this number to about 700 will serve to improve staff productiv-
ity to a level comparable to that of similar ports; and
(c) The provision of formal and on-the-job training for higher and
intermediate level staff as well as for manual labor through a
program established in conjunction with KlTT. Training abroad
for top level staff will be financed under the proposed project
for the general manager, director of cargo handling, financial
director, director of maintenance, director of workshop and
director of general administration; training for intermediate
level staff has already been provided by other donors. For
manual labor, technical assistance will be provided under the
proposed project to organize JAPG's training department to
prepare a modular training system, and to train future local
trainers.
33.      The effect of the technical assistance to be provided under the
proposed project will be to improve port efficiency. In this respect, JAPG
has agreed on the following operational targets: (i) ship-waiting time should
be close to zero by FY1987; tonnage per day at quay will increase up to 370t
in FY1987; (ii) tonnage per gang hour wi'll be at least 7 tons in FY1987; (iii)
average staying time of merchandise in the port will be less than 12 days by
FY1986, and (iv) the rate of availability of cargo handling equipment will
increase up to 70% in FY1987.

The Port Subsector
34.      Bissau Port. The port of Bissau, 80 km from the ocean, on the
northern shore of the River Geba estuary, is reached by a channel passing
through numerous shoals. The channel, which has suffered only minor silt-
ation, has a minimum depth of tOm below low-water level. The port has a
sheltered harbor, with good anchorage ground located between the town of
Bissau and the Ilheu do Rei islet.
35.      The port has a T-shaped commercial wharf with a single berth 130m
long and 25m wide for 5-10,000 dwt ocean-going vessels. Siltation has reduced
its minimum depth alongside to about 5.Om at lov -ater. Smaller ships (500-
2,000 dwt) are able to berth inside the T-head depending on length and draft.
The wharf, built in 1952, is of reinforced concrete deck supported by rein-
forced concrete beans, diagonals and piles. ibout 120 beams are in need of
urgent repair and some of the diagonal members are severely damaged, with
extensive cracks and considerable corrosion of the reinforcing steel. The
fender svstem is also damaged or gone, and the original water and lighting
systems are out of order.
36.      A second T-shaped pier, of lesser depth, known as the Navy Jetty, is
used mainly by the naval units and small passenger vessels. A coastal ship-
ping quay wall (known as the Bolola quay), is used for unloading fish and
cargo from barges, but it is inaccessible at low water. A petroleum terminal,
known as DICOL wharf, some 2.5 km west of the commercial berth recently col-
lapsed; products are currently imported through a buoy-berth. This wharf was
the only facility suitable for ship-bunkering.
37.      River Ports.  Coastal shipping and river navigation play an important
role in transportation, since 85% of the population lives near a navigable
waterway, and distances on the major domestic trade routes are frequently
shorter by river than by road. River transport is also the only reliable
means of passenger transport in the southern part of the country during the
rainy season when most of the roads become impassable. There are some 20
coastal or river ports regularly served by barges.  Most of these ports, which
consist of a small wooden or concrete pier, are severely damaged through poor
maintenance, and in urgent need of repair. The proposed project includes the
rehabilitation of four of these ports, mainly in the south, that play a major
role in marketing agricultural inputs, supplying Bissau with staple food from
the south, and supplying the provinces with products from Bissau.
38.      Traffic.  In 1981, traffic at Bissau port totalled 134,000 tons,
consisting of 87,000t of international general cargo traffic (of which 70,000t
were imports) and 47,000t of domestic coastal traffic.  International traffic
grew at about 2% between 1975 and 1981, due to increases in cereal imports
resulting from the decline in rice production. Consistent with the estimated
limited potential for economic development in the medium term, forecasts
assume an overall growth of about 3.5% p.a. during the 1980's, with imports
remaining moderate (2.5%) since the completion of on-going rice projects is
expected to result in a decline in rice imports. Exports are expected to grow
at about 6% p.a., from an average 19,000t in 1979-81 to about 33,000t in 1990,
due to an expected recovery in exports of groundnuts (following marketing
system reorganization, presently underway), locally processed fish products,
palm kernel and wood products. Should agricultural development be less suc-



-10-
cessful than expected, imports would be higher than forecast, and exports
lower. Total traffic in this case could well exceed the forecast level. The
Government is developing the fishing industry with assistance from foreign
partners, and forecasts assume that landings in Bissau will reach 8,000t of
high value species (sole, shrimp, red mullet, etc.) by 1990 (about 8% of the
current total catch of the foreLgn fleet for these species). About half the
fish landed will be frozen and the other half processed.
39.      River traffic has traditionally been an im'ortant mode of inter-
regional transport.  Total barge traffic decreased from about 55,000t in 1975-
77 to about 35,000t in 1978-81. However, traffic resumed increasing since
1979 and reached 42,000t in 1981. Traffic fluctuation reflects the poor per-
formance of agriculture and the varying volume of international food relief
aid.  A 4% annual growth rate is expected after 1985 as river traffic develops
with the islands and the rice growing areas of Tombali in the south, where
barge traffic will be concentrated because it is cheaper than road trans-
port. In the north and northwest where the road network is being improved,
traffic forecasts assume a continued slight decrease during the 1982-85 period
due to the gradual diversion of barge traffic to road transport.
40.     -Management, Accounting and Auditing.  JAPG currently operates on a
cash basis. Technical assistance will be provided under the proposed project
to set up a financial department, a commercial accounting system and a cost
accounting system. From FY1985 onward, JAPG's accounts will be audited
annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Association under terms and
conditions agre'ed upon with the Association (Section 4.02 of Draft Project
Agreement), and financed for the first three years under the proposed pro-
ject. JAPG will present annually to the Association the updated three-year
corporate plan including a manpower plan, an investment plan and a financial
plan, from January 1, 1985 onward (Section 4.09 of draft Project Agreement).
41.      Financial performance.  JAPG operates at a considerable loss (46% of
revenue), due to overstaffing and an insufficient tariff level. Tariffs cover
only cash outlays for operations, and are inadequately structured, undercharg-
ing domestic traffic and serv-ces provided to ships. While JAPG has a low
level of indebtedness, it has not serviced its debt to the Government since
FY1975.  However, it has sufficient cash reserves to operate under normal
conditions.                A
42.      Financial forecasts.  JAPG's future financial objectives are to: (a)
become financially self-supporting; (b) improve productivity, in order to
avoid excessive tariff increases; and (c) restore its borrowing capacity.
However, due to the high cost of port construction under the Port Development
Program (para. 45), JAPG is expected to be viable only on a cash basis in the
long run, while on an accrual basis it will continue to show a sizeable defi-
cit until 1989. In order to ensure that future increases in working expenses
(mostly staff costs) are consistent with increases in port revenues, and do
not jeopardize JAPG's financial viability as they currently do, agreement was
reached with JAPG that it will reduce its total staff costs from their current
level of 96% of operational revenue, to less than 50% in FY1984, 35% in FY1985
and 25% from FY1986 onward (Section 4.05 of Draft Project Agreement). To en-
sure that cost reduction is not achieved at the expense of necessary port
infrastructure maintenance, JAPG will present to the Association for consult-
ation by December 31 of each year a maintenance program including a mainte-



-11-
nance budget. In the past, up to seven months of revenues were held as re-
ceivables, which caused chronic cash shortages. Agreement -was reached with
JAPG that once the commercial and financial departments are reorganized, re-
ceivables will be reduced to less than three months of revenues by end 1984
and less than 2.5 months of revenue for FY1986 onward (Section 4.08 of Draft
Project Agreement).
*      43.       JAPG's investment plan for FY1982-1987 amounts to about GP 1.6 bil-
lion, as compared to a forecast annual revenue of GP 120 million in Ff1984.
If this level is exceeded, the port will be unable to meet resulting financial
commitments, even with concessionary borrowing.  Agreement was reached with
JAPG that during 1982-87 it will not undertake any capital investment in any
year for more than the equivalent of US$100,000, in addition to the project
and the construction of a new 260m deep-water berth, without prior consult-
ation with the Association (Section 4.07 of Draft Project Agreement).
44.      Also, in order to ensure JAPG's creditworthiness prior to incurring
more debts, overdue debts will be rescheduled and paid over four years
(Section 4.03 of Draft Project Agreement). This would ensure that JAPG is
capable of servicing the debts arising from its investment and financing
plans, financing woreking capital increases and contributing to future capital
investment. Its debt service coverage ratio should be at least 5.5 in FY1984,
4.0 in FY1985, 2.3 in FY1986 and 2.0 in FY1987. (Section 4.04 of Draft Project
Agreement).  Also JAPG will maintain a debt/equity ratio of at least .75 in
YY1984 and FY1985, .90 in FT1986 and 1.1 for FY1987 (Section 4.04 of Draft
Project Agreement); to that end Government will transfer to JAPG part of the
funds made available by other donors in the form of equity contributions. Out
of the US$16 million lent to the Government, US$11 million will be relent to
JAPG, at an annual t1p interest rate, over 20 years with five years of
grace. The foreign exchange risk will be borne by JAPG. The overall impact
of the investment program on Government finance, taking into consideration
each donor's lending conditions to the Government and relending conditions to
JAPG, is a net inflow of revenue of GP 37 million in FY1986, GP 66 million in
FY1988 and GP 97 million in FY1989.
45.      Tariffs.  In order to raise JAPG's cash generation to required
levels, average per ton tariff will be increased from US$14 to about US$29 at
constant 1982 prices between FY1982 and FY1987. Increases beyond this level
may have adverse economic effects and divert traffic to neighboring ports. An
initial tariff increase to a level of US$21.5 per ton in 1982 prices has been
effected, and further increases of 65% in FY1985 and 25% in FY1986 are antici-
pated.  Also, the tariff structure will be improved by increasing charges on
ships and rentals more than charges on merchandise, so that for each category
of service, the tariff covers at least operating costs. Under a policy such
as described, JAPG will achieve a sustainable cash situation in the long run
and be capable of satisfactorily meeting all its financial obligations.
Despite this stringent financial policy, JAPG will be unable to produce a
positive net result until FY1988, but will show an improving financial rate of
return on revalued net fixed assets, increasing from the current negative
value to 2.5% from FY1988 onward.

PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
46.      Studi-s for the construction of a new port at Bissau were performed
in 1977 by an Italian consulting firm under Kuwait Fund financing. At the
Government's request, the Association reviewed the consultants proposals and
advised Guinea-Bissau that the construction of a new port was not justified by
foreseeable traffic levels. The Association suggested that the rehabilitation
and expansion of the existing port facilities were preferable.  The Government
agreed to the Association's recommendation that a feasibility study be pre-
pared for a more modest project, including economic justification, financial
analysis and project design. In November 1980 the Association approved a
US$800,000 advance from the Project Preparation Facility under which consul-
tants were retained to perform this feasibility study. Their main recommenda-
tion was the construction of a new 260m general cargo berth estimated to cost
about US$28 million, rehabilitation of the existing commercial berth and four
river ports and provision of cargo handling equipment and navigation aids.
47.      The project was appraised in February 1982 by the Association, the
Kuwait Fund and BADEA. It was agreed during appraisal that the Arab donors
jointly finance the 260m berth and the cargo handling equipment. Later, the
Association advised the Government that it estimated the rate of return on the
proposed new general cargo berth to be about 9% rather than 13% as calculated
by the consultants. The Association indicated that a scaled-down berth of
130m would reduce the cost of this component to about US$21 million and would
yield a return of 13%. However, the Government and the Arab donors decided to
proceed with the 260m berth as designed by the consultants. It was then agreed
that the overall project would be considered a two-part Port Development
Program. Part A would include the rehabilitation of the existing commercial
berth, four river ports, and four ferry ramps, the provision of navigation
aids, and institutional support to the MTT and JAPG through technical assis-
tance for organization, planning, management, port operations and training.
Part B would be the construction of a new 260m deep-water berth for general
cargo, and the provision of cargo-handling equipment. The consultants prepared
tender documents and civil works contracts for both Parts A and B. Contractors
for civil works were prequalified in August 1982 in accordance with Bank Group
guidelines.
48.      Part A is estimated to cost US$16.4 million equivalent; Part B about
US$32.5 million equivalent. The Government has requested that Part A and the
supervision of the construction of the new quay (US$1.0 million) be financed
by the Association and Part B jointly by the Kuwait Fund (US$10.0 million),
BADEA (US$10.0 million), the Saudi Fund (US$8.5 million) and the OPEC Special
Fund (US$3.0 million). The proposed project is for Part A of the Development
Program plus the supervision of the construction of the new quay; however, the
total cost of the Program as a whole (estimated at $48.9 million) has been
taken into account in assessing JAPG's future financial position.



-1 3-
49.      The main objectives of the proposed project are: ti) to improve MTT's
capability in transport sector planning and supervision cf transport sector
companies through technical assistance; (ii) to establish an autonomous trans-
port company to improve access to rural areas; (iii) to increase the effi-
ciency of port operations and management by providing technical assistance and
training to JAPG; (iv) to ensure the ability of Bissau port to continue han-
dling traffic by rehabilitating its rapidly deteriorating commercial berth and
providing necessary navigation aids; (v) to ensure the efficiency of handling
river traffic by rehabilitating four river ports and four ferry ramps; and
(vi) to ensure the availability of technical assistance by alleviating the
housing shortage through the construction of an apartment building.
50.      Negotiations for the proposed Credit were held in Bissau from April
26 to 28, 1983, with a Government delegation led by the Minister of Transport
and Tourism. Staff Appraisal Report No. 4311-GUB is being distributed sepa-
rately to the Executive Directors. Supplementary project data appear in Annex
III.
Project Description
51.      The project consists of the following components:
(a) Technical assistance to MTT, including transport policy for-
mulation, organization of a transport association for transport
industry, and creation, management and operation of an inde-
pendent transport company;
(b)  Technical Assistance to JAPG, including project preparation and
construction supervision, training in port operations and man-
agement, external auditing, and organization of a training
system;
(c) Civil works, including rehabilitation of the existing commercial
berth at Bissau port; rehabilitation of four river ports at
Binta, Caboxanque, Cacine and Cadique; rehabilitation of four
ferry ramps at Enxude, Sao Vincente, Joso Landim and Farina; and
provision of an office and apartment building in Bissau for
technical assistance experts and training purposes;
(d)  Supervision of the construction of the new commercial quay in
Bissau Port; and
(e)  Navigation aids, in the channel leading to Bissau port and in
the rivers leading to the project ports, and the purchase of a
buoyage vessel.
Project Cost, Financing and Disbursement
52.      Total project cost is estimated at US$17.36 million equivalent, of
which US$16.00 million (92%) is in foreign currency. Costs are net of taxes
from which the project would be exempt. Estimates for civil works and navi-
gation aids reflect June 1983 prices and are based on international prices for
similar works and equipment and recently executed projects in Western Africa.



-14-
Estimates for technical assistance are based on an average of US$8,000 per
man-month including per diem, transportation and other reimbursable items.
Physical contingencies are 10% on civil works and 5% on navigation aids. Price
contingencies are: 'a) 12% annually on local expenditures; and (b) 8% in 1983,
7.5% in 1984 and 6% in 1985-1987 on foreign expenditures.
53.      The proposed IDA Credit of SDR 14.9 million (US$16.0 million equi-
valent) will finance 92% of total project costs. It vill be disbursed against
94% of total expenditures for civil works, 100% of total expenditures for
navigation aids and 88% of total expenditures for construction supervision and
technical assistance. The IDA Credit includes US$800,000 equivalent for re-
financing the advance from the Project Preparation Facility. The Government
and JAPG will provide US$1.36 million equivalent (US$0.67 and US$0.69 respec-
tively) to cover the project's local costs.
54.      Of the proceeds of the IDA Credit, US$11.0 million equivalent will be
on-lent by the Government to JAPG at l1l per annum, for 20 years, including 5
years grace, under a subsidiary loan agreement, with terms and conditions
satisfactory to the Association (Section 3.01(c) of Draft Development Credit
Agreement). The execution of the subsidiary loan agreement will be a condi-
tion of Credit effectiveness (Section 6.01 of Draft Development Credit Agree-
ment). Disbursement for technical assistance and training to JAPG will be
subject to the selection of counterparts acceptable to the Association, and
disbursements for technical assistance to the new national transport company
will be subject to the Association's agreement on that company's organiza-
tional plan and counterparts (Para. 3 of Schedule I of the Draft Development
Credit Agreement).
Project Implementation
55.      JAPG is responsible for project implementation except as regards
technical assistance to MTT and provision of navigation aids, for which NTT
will be responsible . Tender documents have been prepared by the consultants
and agreed upon by the Association. Tendering under international competitive
bidding is scheduled for July 1983 and contract award in December 1983. Con-
struction is expected to begin in early 1984 and be completed by late 1987.
All civil works will be awarded to the same contractor and will be supervised
by independent consultants under terms and conditions satisfactory to the
Association (Section 2.02 of the Draft Project Agreement). The consuitants
will report to a Project Management Unit under the direction of the Minister
of Transport and Tourism and composed of the Directors General of the Minis-
tries of Transport and Tourism, Public Works, Economics and Finance, the State
Secretariat for Planning, and JAPG. The Association will assist the Govern-
ment and JAPG in preparing terms of reference for consultants for technical
assistance and training, and for supervision of civil works and navigation
aids. The Government will implement the Action Plan for Sector Institution
Building.
Environmental Impact
56.      None of the proposed works should affect the ecology of the city of
Bissau, the port, or adjacent water areas, since all rehabilitation works are
confined to existing facilities that have operated in the same location for
several years.



-15-
Project Benefits and Risks
57.      The economic rate of return of the proposed project is about 21%.
Quantified economic benefits are: (a) ship-time savings for ocean-going ves-
sels calling at Bissau port; (b) savings in river transport costs through
reduced turnaround time of barges; (c) savings on avoidance of traffic
diversion to more expensive road transport; (d) savings on avoidance of cost
of removing the existing commercial berth if not rehabilitated; (e) savings in
time spent in port by the fishing fleet; and (f) additional benefits to the
local fish processing plants.
58.      Technical assistance and training provided under the proposed project
will increase the efficiency of port operations and management, improve ;APG's
accounting system and support Government's efforts to reorganize the transport
sector. It will assist the Government in planning its investment on rational
bases and in implementing a taxation system which would lead to improved cost
recovery from road users and a better allocation of traffic between modes. No
attempt has been made to estimate the rate of return on technical assistance
and training, which represent 32% of total project costs. Both are essential
for the long-term efficiency of the sector and will greatly enhance the imple-
mentation of future projects in the sector.
59.      Guinea-Bissau may face some difficulties with the recruitment of
necessary qualified staff and counterparts to the expatriate experts. Assur-
ances were obtained from MTT and JAPG that recruitment will begin without
delay. The possible shortage of local funds for financing even the small
portion of project local costs is also a risk. Civil works have been designed
in accordance with standard engineering principles and do not involve signifi-
cant or unusual technical risks.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRURENTS AND AUTHORITY
60.      The Draft Development Credit Agreement between the Republic of
Guinea-Bissau and the Association, the Draft Project Agreement between JAPG
and the Association, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided for in
Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the Association are
being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
61.      Special conditions of the Draft Development Credit Agreement and the
Draft Project Agreement are referred to in the text and listed in Section III
of Annex III to this report. The execution of the Subsidiary Loan Agreement
between the Government and JAPG for on-lending of US$11.0 million equivalent
of the IDA credit proceeds is a condition of Credit effectiveness. (Section
6.01 of the Draft Development Credit Agreement.)
62.      I am satisfied that the proposed Development Credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of the Association.
