                         Implementation Status Overview
                         Since May 2012, the project has continued to make progress and achieved most planned activities and progress is rated Moderately Satisfactory. Through September 2012, 65
                         percent of the “deliverables? from the Annual Work Plan 2012 were delivered. A substantial number of activities are ongoing and are expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
                         Several small sub-projects were completed including the construction of the Covane Lodge &the water provision (Limpopo NP), the honey bee farming/ harvesting sub-projects in
                         Maputo SR and Chimanimani SR, and horticulture and boreholes near Zinave NP. The construction works in Banhine National Park have been completed and are near completion in
                         Zinave National Park. The construction works being implemented in Chimanimani National Reserve and Maputo Special Reserve are well under way, however, have experienced
                         delays. Some important activities identified in the last mission have not progressed as planned including delays in appointment of the Chair/Board of ANAC, the preparation of
                         Tourism Concession Manual and completion of some of the infrastructure works which could affect the project outcomes.
