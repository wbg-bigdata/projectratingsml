THIRD WAPDA POWER PROJECT
Credit and Project Summary
Borrower:            Islamic Republic of Pakistan.
Beneficiary:         Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA).
Amount:              US$45.0 million (IDA); and about US$35.0 million
(EEC Special Action Credit).
Terms:               Standard IDA and EEC Special Action Account.
Relending            From Government to WAPDA:  25 years, including 5 years
Terms:             grace, with interest at 8.75% per annum; the Govern-
ment will bear the foreign exchange risk.
Project
Description:       The project consists of four years (1979/80-1982/83)
of WAPDA's secondary transmission development program
which is essential for providing for the transmission
and distribution of power from existing or planned
generating facilities and for improving system efficiency.
The project comprises (a) the construction of about
2,700 miles of 220 kV, 132 kV and 66 kV transmission
lines; (b) the construction, expansion and conversion
of about 210 substations of 220/132 kV and 132/66/11 kV
with a total capacity of about 4,800 MVA; and (c) storage
facilities for project materials and equipment. The
project also includes studies for (i) a load dispatch
system, and (ii) conversion of the 220 kV Karachi-Tarbela
transmission system to. 500 kV operation. The principal
risk is the possibility of slippage in the construction
program, with consequent cost overruns and loss of
revenues. This risk will be reduced by the establishment
of a project management team which will be responsible
for the efficient implementation of the project.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
PROPOSED CREDITS TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR THE THIRD WAPDA POWER PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on two proposed
credits to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for the equivalent of US$80.0
million on standard IDA and EEC Special Action Credit terms to help finance a
third WAPDA power project.  One credit of US$45.0 million would be made from
IDA resources; a second credit of about US$35.0 million would be made from the
EEC Special Action Account and administered by the Association in accordance
with the terms of the Agreement of May 2, 1978, between the Association and
the European Economic Community. The proceeds of the credits would be relent
to the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) for 25 years, including
5 years of grace, with interest at 8.75% per annum.
2.        The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), the Kredit-
anstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW, Germany), and the Asian Development Bank
are expected to participate with loans of US$14.5 million, US$18.0 million,
and US$25.0 million equivalent respectively.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
3.        The most recent economic report "Pakistan:  Economic Developrnents
and Fifth Plan Review" (No. 2394-PAK, dated April 12, 1979) was distributed
to the Executive Directors on April 18, 1979.
4.        Economic performance during most of the 1970s has compared unfavor-
ably with the record of rapid growth of output and exports during the 1960s.
GDP has grown at about 4.0% per annum in real terms, compared to more than 6%
during the 1960s, and rapid population growth has meant that there has been
little increase in per capita incomes. Output in the major productive sectors
(agriculture and manufacturing) has risen even more slowly than GDP - at
about 2.5-3.0% per annum - and GDP itself achieved a growth rate of 4% only
as a result of expansion in construction, government and service industries.
During the last two years, however, a more rapid upturn in GDP exports and
agricultural output has taken place, although some major crops have continued
to suffer setbacks.
5.        To a considerable degree the disappointing performance in the 1970s
has been due to factors outside the Government's immediate or direct control.
The decade began in crisis with the war with India and the separation of
Bangladesh, and there followed a series of economic and climatic misfortunes
which undermined the basis for growth. These included a poor monsoon in
1/   Parts I and II are substantially the same as Parts I and II of the
President's Report on the Fourth Agricultural Development Bank Project
(No. P-2635-PAK, dated October 25, 1979).

1974/75 and serious floods in 1972/73 and 1975/76, as well as the petroleum
crisis and the subsequent world recession. Moreover, political instability
and uncertainty have continued to have serious economic implications. However,
the policy response to these problems has also in many respects been inade-
quate, contributing significantly to the economy's disappointing performance.
Changing attitudes to the private sector, illustrated by a series of national-
izations that began in 1972, had a depressing effect on private investment,
while legislation served to increase real wages in the industrial sector at a
time of other cost increases and increasingly difficult export markets. Major
increases in public investment have more than offset declining private invest-
ment, but public investment has been concentrated in capital-intensive,
long-gestation projects which in many cases have yet to result in increased
production. This investment contributed to a massive deterioration in the
trade account, itself aggravated by Government policies designed to protect
the consumer from the implications of stagnating production. To finance
imports, and to cover serious shortfalls in public saving, the Government
resorted to heavy borrowing from abroad, including a major increase from OPEC
countries during the mid-1970s. Workers' remittances have increased very
substantially over the last few years, but a very large trade deficit and
rising debt repayments have imposed a serious strain on the balance of pay-
ments while the problem of domestic resource mobilization has continued to
constrain economic development.
6.        A start has been made in the process of policy adjustment and mea-
sures have been implemented which go some way towards solving the country's
serious resource management problems. The issue price of wholemeal wheat
flour to the public was recently increased by 25%, an important step towards
reducing the high level of subsidies. The agricultural processing industries
(except the vegetable ghee industry) have been denationalized, the area open
to private investment has been greatly extended, credit and tax incentives
(especially for export) have been improved and improvements have been recorded
in the labor situation. Agricultural support prices have been maintained, and
in some cases increased, and an effort is being made to improve input avail-
ability and other supporting services to the farmer. Finally, a review of
Government investment and related priorities was undertaken in the context of
the preparation of the revised Fifth Plan which, while still over-optimistic
in many of its projections, recognizes the need to redirect the pattern of
economic development away from large public industrial and other long gesta-
tion projects and towards the agricultural and social sectors.
7.        These measures have in part been responsible for the first major
upturn in the economy since the FY73/FY74 commodity boom. GDP rose by 6%
during FY78 and at a similar rate in FY79; and exports, in real terms, by
11% and 29% respectively. Nevertheless, despite some favorable developments,
prospects for future growth remain uncertain. For the immediate future, this
uncertainty relates to worrying trends in the overall financial management of
the economy. Several tax and tariff increases which were announced in the
FY80 budget have somewhat improved the budgetary outlook; but the external
payments position has continued to deteriorate, with increasing dependence
on short-term borrowing and reserves drawn down to undesirably low levels.
For the longer term, the most disturbing features are continued low levels of



- 3 -
productivity in agriculture, the lack of any significant recovery in private
investment and the rapid growth in population.
8.         Despite the fact that the economic situation provides little room
for maneuver, and despite the policy changes that have already taken place,
further measures appear essential if the basic issues limiting economic growth
in the longer term are to be adequately addressed. These issues include the
farm-level factors affecting low productivity in agriculture; the structure
and competitiveness of the industrial sector; the factors lying behind conti-
nued rapid growth in population; the need to redirect social service expendi-
tures; the deterioration in the performance of public sector enterprises and
the administrative machinery generally; the low elasticity of tax revenues
and the problems of public resource mobilization; and the large trade deficit
and the continued dependence on capital inflows from abroad.
9.        Agriculture remains the economy's mainstay, accounting directly for
roughly a third of GDP, employing about 60% of the labor force and, directly
or indirectly, providing nearly two-thirds of total exports. Repeated set-
backs in agriculture have undermined growth and thrown doubt on the input-
based strategies followed in recent years. The FY78 wheat crop was attacked
by rust and, for this and other reasons, declined by 10%. This setback
fortunately was temporary and a sharp recovery in wheat output was recorded in
FY79. Also of concern have been the persistent problems besetting cotton;
production in FY79 fell to 2.7 million bales compared to nearly 4 million in
the early 1970s. However, the current crop, not yet fully harvested, is
said to be encouraging and likely to reach 3.6 million bales. Rice production
in FY80, similarly in the process of being harvested, is also said to be good.
The sugar crop, on the other hand, has been poor recently, and it is clear
that despite encouraging signs a number of fundamental factors continue to
limit agricultural productivity at levels well below the potential implied by
the resources and technologies already available. Thus, while considerable
potential still exists for the additional use of fertilizer and other inputs,
it appears also essential to give greater priority to evolving complementary
policies and programs which have a direct impact at the farm level. Major
improvements are possible in the water delivery system and in the general
level of agricultural practices; high priority therefore needs to be given to
water management programs and to projects designed to establish a systematic
and effective research and extension service. Without such initiatives,
agricultural growth in the longer term will suffer and the benefits from the
available inputs and resources will remain well below their technical potential.
10.       Industry contributes about 15% of GDP and during much of the 1950s
and 1960s provided a major stimulus to growth. Growth rates in manufacturing
production have, however, declined from about 10% per year during the 1960s
to little over 2% during most of the 1970s, although since the prese!nt Gov-
ernment came to power there has been some recovery in both manufacturing
value added and exports. The major structural change in the industrial sector
since 1973 has been the expansion of the public sector from about 10% to about
25% of industrial assets. Private investment declined markedly as a result
of nationalization fears, rapid cost inflation, labor problems, adverse export
market conditions and problems in raw material supply. The textile industry,



- 4 -
in particular, which accounts for about 40% of value added in large-
scale industry, has suffered from problems of inefficiency, excess capacity
and a lack of competitiveness in foreign markets, while manufacturing growth
generally has been affected by the poor performance of public sector enter-
prises. A recovery in world markets and export incentives have together
contributed to a recent revival in yarn exports, but a more fundamental
improvement in industrial investment depends on a period of reasonably pro-
longed stability and a shift in the overall balance of production towards
higher value added products which are responsive to market opportunities and
preferences. Also important will be progress in, and results from, oil
exploration for which there appears to be considerable potential.
11.       While it is clearly vital to re-establish a base for more rapid
growth in the commodity-producing sectors, it is also true that rapid growth
in population, currently running at about 3% per annum, has seriously handi-
capped the country's ability to improve living standards. Family planning
programs have unfortunately had little effect and there have been few changes
in the socio-economic environment of a type that usually accompany declines
in fertility. Rapid population growth places severe burdens on Government
resources simply to maintain education and health programs at their current
inadequate standards. However, without higher literacy rates, improved health
facilities and a reduction in child mortality, it is doubtful that population
growth rates can be much reduced. Expenditures on social services remain
comparatively low and undue emphasis has been given to such elements as higher
education and urban health facilities. High priority needs therefore to be
given not only to increased allocations for family planning and social service
expenditure but also to its redirection to serve the wider interests of the
population and the economy.
12.       Policies that face the longer term issues in both the productive
and the social sectors will take time to have an appreciable effect and will
have to be implemented in the context of continued domestic and external
resource constraints. Domestic resource mobilization has become a major prob-
lem area in the economy. Public sector development expenditures increased
from 5.5% of GDP in FY71 to 11.2% in FY77 and to an estimated 10.3% in FY79,
while non-development expenditures more than trebled. Public sector savings
declined, and indeed were negative from FY72 to FY75, although they recovered
and remain marginally positive. The scope for non-inflationary domestic
borrowing has been limited and financing public expenditures has become
heavily dependent on external and domestic bank borrowing. Foreign assistance
financed no less than 70% of development expenditures in FY76 although this
fell to 53% in FY79 because of a decline in aid disbursements. To improve
domestic resource mobilization, additional taxation and improvements in tax
administration are needed; non-development expenditures must be restrained,
possibly through selective reductions in subsidies; and the contribution of
public enterprises should be enhanced, for instance through tariff increases.
Given the limits to domestic and external borrowing, and the constraints on
increasing revenues and decreasing current expenditures, it remains essential
to limit the size and adjust the content of the public investment program.
Emphasis needs to be given to providing adequate resources for agriculture and
other areas where substantial and rapid increases in production and exports



appear possible, as well as to the social sectors, which have been neglected
in recent years. Conversely, the proportion of resources devoted to capital-
intensive industrial and long-gestation projects should be reduced.
13.       The external position has been greatly assisted by rapidly rising
workers' remittances from abroad, notably from the Middle East; these rose
from US$130 million in FY73 to US$578 million in FY77, to US$1,166 million
in FY78 and to an estimated US$1,400 million in FY79. This increase has, how-
ever, been more than offset by a massive deterioration in the trade balance
with the result that the current account deficit increased from about US$130
million in FY73 to more than US$1,000 million in FY75. The huge increase in
remittances reduced the current account deficit to US$600 million in FY78 but
the deficit again rose to over US$1 billion in FY79, largely due to a 30%
increase in the value of imports, itself in part the consequence of last
year's poor wheat crop. While suspension of debt payments to Iran, short-term
borrowing and a run down in international reserves kept the external sector
manageable in FY79, the options for FY80 are much more limited. Scheduled
debt service will rise substantially and net aid flows--according to Government
figures--will remain at only about US$350 million. Allowing for a somewhat
lower current account deficit than expected by the Government, a US$200 million
loan from Saudi Arabia to the Zakat Fund, and additional short-term financing,
the gap remaining to be financed appears to be in the region of US$200 million.
Foreign exchange reserves at present are very low and will remain tight unless
additional resources (e.g., from the IMF, debt relief or quick-disbursing
non-project aid) become available.
14.       Total external debt outstanding at the beginning of FY79 amounted
to about US$7.2 billion of which US$4.1 billion was due to bilateral members
of the Pakistan Consortium, US$1.1 billion to OPEC, US$1.2 billion to multi-
lateral agencies and the balance to other bilateral and private lenders.
Contractual debt service to multilateral and bilateral aid agencies rose from
US$313 million in FY73 to US$397 in FY78 although the burden of these payments
was eased to US$200 and US$261 million respectively as a result of debt relief
arrangements. The four-year debt relief agreement with Consortium countries
expired on June 30, 1978, and as no further agreement was reached debt service
payments rose sharply in FY79. Contractual payments in FY80 are expected to
amount to over US$600 million and considerably more in subsequent years. As
a proportion of exports, non-factor service payments and workers' remittances,
debt service rose from about 15% in the FY75-77 period to around 17.5% in
FY79. Pakistan obviously needs to exercise care in protecting its ability to
borrow to meet future requirements, and to restrict commercial borrowing to
a minimum. For this reason, Bank Group lending to Pakistan is currently con-
fined to IDA credits. Pakistan's debt to the Bank and IDA at the end of FY78
was about 15% of its external public indebtedness. The share of tthe Bank
Group in total debt service is now about 9%.
15.       Pakistan's resource endowment, especially in the Indus Basin system,
is substantial and during the 1960s the economy demonstrated a considerable
capacity for growth. Rough estimates suggest that the economy could grow at
perhaps 5-6% per annum over the next five years, and that this could be
accompanied by a wider distribution of the benefits of growth than was



- 6 -
achieved during the 1960s. A start has been made in the process of policy
adjustment, but it is clear that a wide range of further initiatives are
necessary to deal with the causes underlying the economy's disappointing
performance over much of the 1970s. Only if these new policies and programs
are pursued consistently over a number of years will the basis for longer-term
improvements in living standards for the population as a whole be established.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN PAKISTAN
16.       The cumulative total of Bank/IDA commitments to Pakistan (exclusive
of loans and credits or portions thereof which were disbursed in the former
East Pakistan) now amounts to approximately US$1.7 billion. During its long
association with Pakistan, the Bank Group has been involved in almost all
sectors of the economy. Through FY79, 38% of total commitments were for
public services, 30% for agriculture, 31% for industry (of which 9% was for
industrial imports) and 2% for education. Lending for public services has
amounted to almost US$700 million and has included loans and credits for
railways, electric power, gas pipelines, Karachi Port, highways, telecommu-
nications and water supplies. A large part of past lending for agriculture
was for Indus Basin projects. Lending for industry has been mainly through
the Pakistan Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation (PICIC). For most
projects for which loans and credits are being disbursed, construction is now
going ahead satisfactorily. The principal problems being encountered are
that the rates charged by some of the public services have not kept pace with
inflation and, hence, some utilities are not earning adequate returns. Annex
II contains a summary statement of Bank loans and IDA credits as of September 30,
1979, and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.
17.       Lending operations in Pakistan have three main objectives.  One of
these is to support the directly productive sectors of the economy and, in
particular, to increase production of import substitutes such as foodgrains,
edible oils, fertilizer and engineering goods and to sustain export growth
in cotton yarn and textiles, rice and a large number of other industrial and
agricultural products. The main part of Bank Group assistance for industry
will continue to be through financial intermediaries. The most important
part of future lending for agriculture is expected to be for the Government's
program to increase productivity in the Indus Basin by controlling salinity
and improving the utilization of surface irrigation and groundwater. The
Bank is the Executing Agency for a UNDP technical assistance grant for
improving agriculture and water planning in the Indus Basin.
18.       Another objective is to support the necessary expansion of, and
to improve the institutions which are responsible for, the principal public
services which have benefitted from Bank Group lending in the past, namely,
the Telegraph and Telephone Department, Karachi Port, Water and Power Devel-
opment Authority, Pakistan Railways, Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Company and
the Lahore Water and Sanitation Agency. A number of these agencies are beset
by institutional weaknesses. In some cases, improvements are being made with
technical assistance financed under loans and credits. In other cases, where



-7 -
the problems are of such a nature that action by government is required, the
Bank Group is encouraging GOP to take remedial measures.
19.       A third objective is to extend lending operations into areas which
will help to bring economic development to the poorest strata of the popula-
tion. This shift implies increased lending for agriculture and rural develop-
ment and will involve significant lending for projects complementary to the
Indus/Tarbela works. In the urban sector, Bank missions have worked with
municipal authorities on the plans for the urban development of Karachi,
whose population now exceeds 4 million, and Lahore, Pakistan's second largest
city. A Karachi master plan was completed in 1974 with the assistance of
consultants financed by UNDP. Within the framework of the plan, a project
was proposed and appraised for urban upgrading in the Lyari section of the
city. This project, however, has been deferred indefinitely due to Government
reconsideration of the project cost and financial arrangements. Planning in
Lahore is at a much earlier stage than in Karachi and the immediate need is
for technical assistance. Accordingly, the IDA credit for the second Lahore
water supply, sewerage and drainage project includes provision for the financ-
ing of urban studies in Lahore. The emphasis being given to agricuLture and
other projects with a low foreign exchange component justifies the financing
of some local expenditures in specific cases.
20.       A number of projects for Bank Group financing are current-Ly under
appraisal or being prepared in Pakistan.  These include a third highways
project, a Karachi bulk water supply project, a grain storage project, a
further irrigation and drainage project, a further credit to PICIC and a
vocational education project.
21.       IFC has made investments in eleven Pakistan enterprises for a total
of US$63.6 million, of which US$54.1 million was by way of loans and US$9.5
million by equity participations (these are shown in Annex II). About US$29.4
million remains outstanding. The enterprises assisted by IFC include three
in the field of pulp and paper products, two in textiles and one each in
cement, steel, fertilizers, food processing and petrochemicals. IFC is also
a shareholder of PICIC.
PART III - THE POWER SECTOR IN PAKISTAN
22.       Pakistan's domestic energy resources are characterized by sizeable
reserves of natural gas, substantial hydro potential but only limited known
reserves of crude oil and exploitable coal, and no uranium. Thus, while hydro
and natural gas have been developed extensively and now account for one half
of total energy requirements, indigenous coal and crude oil supply a much
smaller proportion of requirements. As in most countries in South Asia, a
large part of internal energy requirements is still met by non-commercial
energy sources such as firewood, animal dung, bagasse and maize stalks, which
constitute the bulk of energy supplies in rural areas.



23.       Total hydro potential in Pakistan is estimated at about 40,000 MW,
of which about 10,000 MW could be developed economically. With the full
development of the Tarbela, Mangla and Warsak dams by 1985, there will be
in operation about 3,300 MW of hydro power. The geographical configuration
of Pakistan is such that hydro stations are located in the mountainous north,
while thermal power stations are in the flatter center and south. Thermal
stations play an important role in meeting power needs of the country through-
out the year and in supplementing supplies in the northern grid during low
water months (March-May). During the high water months (July-September) when
hydro energy capability is at its maximum, power is transmitted south enabling
thermal stations to economize on fuel and carry out phased overhauling and
maintenance.
24.       Two main Acts pertaining to the power sector are the Electricity
Act of 1910 and the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) Act of
1958. The Electricity Act is a statutory instrument governing the sector
and inter alia enables the Government to issue licenses for the generation
and distribution of electric power in various areas of the country.
25.       The WAPDA Act inter alia confers on WAPDA the power and obligation
of a licensee under the Electricity Act. WAPDA and the Karachi Electric
Supply Corporation, Ltd. (KESC), which generates and distributes power in
the Karachi area to about 310,000 customers, are the two main entities in
the power sector, with WAPDA accounting for about 80% of the public power
supply in Pakistan and KESC and a few small licensees accounting for the
remaining 20%. There have been suggestions in Pakistan from time to time
that part of WAPDA's transmission system and all of its distribution systems
should be transferred to either the Provinces or to federal distribution com-
panies, but no specific proposals to that effect have yet been put forward.
Under Loan No. 1208T-PAK (Second WAPDA Power Project), it was agreed that the
Bank would be consulted in sufficient time for an exchange of views prior
to any legislation or action which would alter the structure of the power
sector in Pakistan. This arrangement will continue under the proposed project.
26.       The Water and Power Development Authority, created in 1958 and en-
tirely owned by the Government, operates, except in the Karachi area, through-
out the remainder of the country. WAPDA has a dual function: development of
water resources for irrigation and the development and operation of power
systems. In its role in the development of water resources for irrigation, it
constructs storage dams, barrages, canals and tubewells. The dams, including
Tarbela and Mangla, two of the largest earth-rock fill dams in the world,
remain under its control but other irrigation works are turned over to the
Provincial Governments for operation and maintenance after commissioning.
In its role in the power sector, WAPDA constructs and operates power plants,
transmission and distribution systems and serves about 2.5 million customers.
27.       Excluding about 230 MW of private generation, the installed power
generating capacity in Pakistan on June 30, 1979, was 3,430 MW, of which
2,685 MW was installed in the WAPDA system and 745 MW in the KESC system.
The WAPDA system depends mainly on hydro sources with consequent variability
of output, while the KESC system is 80% thermal with the balance nuclear



- 9 -
power. Although the two systems have been recently linked with a network of
220 kV and 132 kV transmission lines, power transfers from one area to another
have been limited by the capacity of the lines. Moreover, long lengths of
secondary transmission lines and inadequate distribution facilities have led
to high power losses. The Government intends to place greater emphasis in
future on the development of transmission and distribution facilities in order
to redress this imbalance. To overcome existing limitations on transmission
capacity, 500 kV transmission lines are now being constructed from larbela to
the dyderabad/Karachi area, with intermediate substations at Faisalaebad,
Multan and Guddu; thiis will integrate fully the hydro resources of the North
with the thermal stations of the Center and South. In addition, secondary
transmission lines, grid substations and distribution systems will be extended
and reinforced to connect about one million new customers during the Fifth
Five-Year Plan (FY79-83).
28.       About 47% of the financial allocations for the power sector in the
Fifth Plan is earmarked for power generation, 34% for transmission and the
balance for distribution and minor projects. Although earlier Government
proposals for expenditures on new generating facilities were reduced in the
final version of the Fifth Plan, the Plan nonetheless provides for expendi-
tures on major new projects during the latter part of the Plan period which
could lead to excess generation capacity beyond 1983 if economic growth and
power demand turn out to be lower than the Government's present expectations.
A careful review of the prospective longer-term growth of power demand is
necessary before the Government commits itself to these major new generation
projects. The Government will, together with WAPDA and KESC, carry out a
long-term demand forecast by June 30, 1980, and on the basis of the results
of this forecast will consult with the Association on the size and composition
of the investment program in the power sector (Section 3.04 of the (Iraft IDA
and Special Action Credit Agreements).
WAPDA
29.       WAPDA is organized in two "Wings", a Water Wing, responsible for
all matters concerning irrigation, water supply and flood control, and a
Power Wing. It is one of the largest employers in Pakistan with permanent
staff of about 66,000, about 57,000 of which are attached to the Powqer Wing.
WAPDA's power operations have grown rapidly in recent years and, as discussed
below, changes in its organization have become necessary to cope with this
expansion.
30.       Under an ongoing loan to WAPDA for power development, funds were
provided for management and accounting consultants to help strengthen the
financial function and introduce an effective management information system
for WAPDA's power operations. In line with the consultants' recommendations
WAPDA has created four senior financial posts. Three of these posts, one in
each of the three operating groups (generation, transmission and distribution),
have been filled. While WAPDA has had difficulty in recruiting a General
Manager, Finance, it has recently identified a suitable candidate and nego-
tiations are in progress. WAPDA has entered into a contract with accounting
consultants to implement the recommendations already made for improving WAPDA's



- 10 -
accounting system. WAPDA will implement these recommendations in accordance
with a timetable acceptable to the Association.
31.       As indicated above (paragraph 27), WAPDA's power system is suffering
from excessively high losses which rose from 30.9% of generation in FY71 to
37.6% in FY77. The high losses are due principally to the excessive length
and loading of WAPDA's transmission lines, theft and bad metering. In consult-
ation with the Association, WAPDA has developed an action program to deal with
these problems, and losses were reduced in FY79 to 34.2%, reversing the his-
torical trend. In order to improve further on these results, WAPDA has
established a unit to implement programs satisfactory to the Association for
the reduction of losses due to theft and inaccurate metering to not more than
5% by June 30, 1982, and for their ultimate elimination, and for the reduction
of transmission and distribution losses to not more than 16% by June 30, 1984
(Section 4.04 of the draft Project Agreement). The proposed project will
itself play a significant role in helping to reduce losses.
Previous Bank Group Involvement
32.       The proposed Credit would be the Bank Group's third lending opera-
tion for the development of WAPDA's power system. There has also been previous
participation in the Indus Basin projects, including Mangla and Tarbela dams,
and a series of four loans to KESC between 1955 and 1967 for generation,
transmission and distribution facilities. The first lending operation for
WAPDA was a credit of US$23 million in 1970 for a project to augmment trans-
mission substation capacity. Although late by about three years, principally
due to delays in procurement, the project has now been completed. The second
lending operation was a Third Window loan of US$50 million (Loan 1208T-PAK) in
1975 to finance part of the 500 kV transmission system. This project was
delayed by about nine months, due to the late appointment of consultants and
slowness in awarding contracts, but is now proceeding satisfactorily. Lower-
than-expected contract prices have led to cancellation of savings of $15
million of the loan. The implementation arrangements of the proposed project
incorporate the experience gained in the previous two projects.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
33.       The proposed project was appraised in September/October 1977 and
reappraised in October/November 1978 after GOP and WAPDA had completed a
number of required preliminary actions. During this period co-financing
possibilities were sought and found, enabling the scope of the project
to be significantly expanded. However, subsequent to negotiations, further
co-financing had to be sought as one prospective contributor withdrew because
of a general cutback in its aid program. The Appraisal Report (No. 1942a-PAK)
on the project is being distributed separately to the Executive Directors.
Additional data on the project are given in Annex III. Negotiations took
place in Washington in April 1979. The Pakistan delegation was led by Mr.
Aftab Ahmad Khan, Secretary, Finance and Economic Affairs.

Project Description
34.       The project covers four years (FY80-83) of WAPDA's program for
secondary transmission development. The main components of the project are:
(a) transmission lines: erection of about 2,700 miles of
220 kV, 132 kV, and 66 kV single and double circuit
lines;
(b) substations: construction, expansion and conversion of
about 210 substations of 220/132 kV and 132/66/11 kV with
an aggregate capacity of about 4,800 MVA;
(c) construction of storage facilities for project materials
and equipment; and
(d) studies of (i) a load dispatch system; and (ii) conversion
of the 220 kV Karachi-Tarbela transmission system to 500 kV
operation.
The proposed project is a crucial segment of WAPDA's investment program in
the power sector over the next four years. The transmission lines and sub-
stations to be constructed under the project will be required to transmit
and distribute the power generated by facilities which are already estab-
lished or which will come on-stream during this period. The project will
ensure a comprehensive, integrated approach to the development of WAPDA's
secondary transmission facilities and will make a substantial contribution
to improving the efficiency of WAPDA's power system.
35.       In addition, the project has provided the Association with the oppor-
tunity to address a number of other critical issues relating both to WAPDA's
operations and to GOP's policies and programs in the power sector. Tese
include the strengthening of the financial organization of WAPDA's Power Wing
(see paragraph 30), actions to be taken by WAPDA to reduce power losses
(paragraph 31), the level and structure of power tariffs (paragraphs 41-42),
and a review of the Government's plan for further expenditures on new genera-
tion facilities (paragraph 28).
Implementation
36.       Engineering, preparation of bidding documents, procurement and
supervision of project construction will be performed by WAPDA's staff, which
has gained experience under the two previous Bank-financed power projects.
Construction will normally be carried out by contractors, although in some
cases it will be undertaken by WAPDA. Because of the size and complexity
of the project, WAPDA has established a project management team which will
be responsible for project implementation.
Cost and Financing
37.       Total project costs, including contingencies, taxes and duties,
are estimated at about US$506 million equivalent, of which US$132 mil'Lion



-- 12 -
would be in foreign exchange. Taxes and duties are estimated at US$59 mil-
lion. A physical contingency allowance of 5% has been included in these
estimates to allow for variation in the scope of work; price contingencies of
11% per year for local costs and 8% per year for foreign costs have also been
provided. Since 1975 wholesale prices in Pakistan have risen an average of
about 8% per year; during the next three years, the inflation rate is pro-
jected to be around 11% per annum.
38.       The proposed IDA Credit of US$45.0 million would finance about 34%
of the foreign exchange cost of the project. The remainder of the foreign
exchange requirements is expected to be provided by the Asian Development
Bank, US$25 million; the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW-Germany), US$18
million; the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), US$14.5 million;
and the European Economic Community (EEC), US$29 million, from its Special
Action Account. The EEC would also provide US$6 million towards local expendi-
tures, making a total contribution from the Community of about US$35 million.
Other local currency costs would be met by WAPDA's internal cash generation
and Government loans and equity contributions. The IDA and EEC Credits would
be relent to WAPDA for 25 years, including 5 years grace, at 8.75% per annum;
this is the Government's current relending rate of foreign funds to revenue-
earning agencies. The ADB, KfW and CIDA funds are expected to be on-lent on
similar terms. The Government would bear the foreign exchange risk. Arrange-
ments for the KfW loan are well advanced. Effectiveness of the KfW loan is a
Condition of Effectiveness of the proposed credits. The ADB loan is not ex-
pected to be signed until mid-1980, and the CIDA loan, which is not required
until late 1981, is expected to be signed around the end of 1980. This fits
in with the implementation requirements of the project. In the event that
these loans should not materialize, the Government would arrange other financ-
ing, either from its own resources, or from additional external borrowings,
in order to carry out the project.
Procurement and Disbursement
39.       Materials (except local materials required for civil works) and
equipment to be financed from the IDA and EEC Special Action Account Credits
would be procured under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) in accordance
with Bank Group Guidelines, except that procurement of materials and equipment
to be financed by the EEC Special Action Credit will be limited to the EEC
member states and developing countries which could be recipients of Special
Action Credits. Domestic suppliers participating in ICB would be accorded a
15% preference or the prevailing import duties, whichever is lower, in bid
comparison.  Materials and equipment of less than US$50,000 equivalent per
contract, up to an aggregate of US$500,000 equivalent, would be procured in
accordance with WAPDA's procedures which are satisfactory. Also, small civil
works for the more than 200 scattered substations and warehouses, of less
than US$200,000 per contract, up to an aggregate of US$6 million equivalent,
the amount to be financed by the EEC Special Action Credit, would be procured
through WAPDA's procedures. Because of their small size and scattered loca-
tions, these works are not expected to be of interest to foreign contractors.
IDA funds would be disbursed as follows: (i) 100% of foreign expenditures for
imported materials and equipment and 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory)



- 13 -
for locally manufactured materials and equipment; and (ii) 100% of expendi-
tures for consultant services. EEC Special Action Funds would be disbursed
as follows: (i) 100% of foreign expenditures and 95% of local expenditures
for civil works; (ii) 100% of foreign expenditures for materials and equip-
ment and 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locally manufactured
materials and equipment; and (iii) 70% of local expenditures for goods pro-
cured locally.
Financial Aspects
40.        WAPDA's financial operating results in the past have not been satis-
factory mainly because of inadequate power tariffs and the large amount of
system losses. This situation has necessitated government financing a large
portion of WAPDA power capital expansion, which has placed a heavy burden on
scarce budgetary resources. To improve WAPDA's finances, it was agreed under
the previous loan (No. 1208T-PAK, dated February 19, 1976) that: (i) tariffs
would be increased in steps during the period 1976/77-1979/80 to permit by no
later than the end of FY80 the financing of 30% of power investments in every
consecutive three-year period through net internal cash generation; and (ii)
the Government would each year, until FY80, make capital contributions (free
of dividend and interest) to WAPDA equivalent to the shortfall between the
actual amount of net internal cash generation and 30% of annual investment
expenditures for power.
41.        The Government has been slow in granting WAPDA the necessary tariff
increases to meet this self-financing requirement. Moreover, past tariff
increases have often exempted domestic and tubewell consumers, who together
account for about 40% of sales.  This has not only reduced WAPDA's revenues
but has also created distortions in the tariff structure. With a view to
rationalizing the tariff structure, WAPDA will complete a tariff study by
December 31, 1979, and implement, beginning July 1, 1980, the recommendations
of the study in accordance with a program satisfactory to the Association,
the Government and WAPDA (Section 4.06 of the draft Project Agreement). The
Association is providing assistance to the organizational unit in WAPDA which
is carrying out the study.
42.        The Government has allowed a general increase in WAPDA's power
tariffs of 25%, effective July 1, 1979, and will allow further increases of
at least 10% in July 1980 and 10% in July 1981. These increases will enable
WAPDA to achieve the 30% self-financing target by FY81, one year later than
envisaged under Loan No. 1208T-PAK. The proportion of WAPDA's self-financing
of its capital expenditures would increase to the 40% level beginning with
FY83, thereby further alleviating the strain on the Government's budget. The
Government will continue to provide, through FY82, equity funds to finance,
together with WAPDA's internal cash generation, at least 30% of its annual
capital expenditures. WAPDA will make annual reviews of the adequacy of its
tariffs and inform the Association of the results of the reviews (Section 3.02
of the draft IDA and Special Action Credit Agreements and Section 4.05 of
the draft Project Agreement).
43.        Government departments and agencies have often been slow in paying
bills, thus aggravating WAPDA's financial position. The Government will



- 14 -
ensure that all federal and provincial agencies and departments pay electricity
charges within three months after receipt of WAPDA's bills and settle arrears
owing to WAPDA as of September 30, 1979 by March 31, 1980 (Section 3.03 of the
draft IDA and Special Action Credit Agreements).
Benefits and Risks
44.       As the project is part of WAPDA's total investment program in the
power sector during FY80-83, it is not possible to separate in a meaningful
manner the portion of the incremental benefits attributable to it. However,
it is possible to calculate an internal rate of return based on a time slice
of WAPDA's total investment program. A comparison of capital, fuel and
operating and maintenance costs with the incremental revenues (valued at the
average tariff level) attributable to this investment program yields a rate of
return of 11%. The project is a crucial segment of WAPDA's investment program
to expand and improve generation, transmission and distribution facilities.
The transmission lines and substations to be constructed under the project
are required to enable available power to reach the load centers and to meet
economically the growing demand for power. One of the main benefits of the
project will be a reduction of system losses and an improvement of the power
factor. These improvements are estimated at the equivalent of 550 MW of
generating capacity, a saving equivalent to about US$300 million. The project
should also contribute towards strengthening WAPDA's Power Wing both technic-
ally and financially, and towards providing the necessary basis for decision-
making on future investments in the power sector. The project is not expected
to create environmental problems.
45.       The principal risk is the possibility of slippage in the construc-
tion program, with consequent cost overruns and loss of revenues and continued
high power losses. The establishment of a project management team to be
responsible for efficient project execution should minimize this risk.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
46.       The draft Development Credit Agreement between the Islamic Republic
of Pakistan and the Association, the draft EEC Special Action Credit Agreement
between the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Association as Administrator
of the EEC Special Action Account established with funds contributed by the
member states of the EEC, the draft Project Agreement between the Association,
the Administrator and WAPDA, and the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement are being distri-
buted to the Executive Directors separately. Special conditions of the Credit
are listed in Section III of Annex III. Additional conditions of effective-
ness include the fulfillment of effectiveness conditions of the KfW loan
(Section 5.01(c) of the draft IDA and EEC Special Action Credit Agreements).
The ADB and CIDA loan agreements are expected to be signed in mid- and late
1980 respectively. This is consistent with the implementation requirements
of the project.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Credit No. 771       Tarbela Dam:  US$35.0 Million Credit of March 10, 1978;
Effective Date: April 4, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1982
This credit, together with other additional contributions arranged
in 1978, is intended to help finance the repairs and additional works required
to complete the project. In September 1973, the Indus River was diverted
through tunnels on schedule to enable the final stage -- the construction of
the closure section of the dam -- to be undertaken. By end-June 1974, the
main embankment had been completed to full height, and the first impoundment
began on schedule in July 1974. In early August, difficulties were encoun-
tered in the operation of the tunnel gates and damage to one of the tunnels
necessitated the emptying of the reservoir and repair of the tunnels and
outlet structure. Agreement was reached with the parties of the Indus Basin
and Tarbela Development Funds whereby special contributions were made by a
number of parties, including IDA (Credit 581-PAK), to help with the cost of
repairs and additional remedial works. The stilling basins suffered further
damage in August 1975 and again in April 1976. Stilling Basin 3 has now been
repaired and has operated satisfactorily. Serious erosion in the plunge pool
below the service spillway during 1977 necessitated additional protection
works. A first phase of these works was completed during the 1977/78 con-
struction season and further works were completed in 1978/79. Since 1975
irrigation requirements from the dam have generally been met. Power gene-
ration by the first four units began in 1977.
Loan No. 1372        Tenth Railway:  US$35.0 Million Loan and US$25.0 Million
and              Credit of March 8, 1977; Effective Date:  May 9, 1977;
Credit No. 684       Closing Date: June 30, 1982
The Tenth Railway Project is proceeding satisfactorily. Procure-
ment for the telecommunications and signalling system is underway.   However,
due to difficulties in supply sources, procurement of wooden sleepers has been
delayed. While PR may be placing too much emphasis on passenger services,
the development of freight services is going in the right direction through
increases in hauling distance and ton kilometers.
1/   These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding
the progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any
problems which are being encountered, and the action being taken to
remedy them. They should be read in this sense, and with the under-
standing that they do not purport to present a balanced evaluation
of strengths and weaknesses in project execution.

ANNEX II
Credit No. 206       Engineering Education:  US$4.0 Million Credit of
June 29, 1970; Effective Date: July 14, 1971; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
The Credit provided US$4.0 million to finance the relocation of
the NED University of Engineering and Technology, Karachi (formerly NED
Engineering College) and technical assistance for the upgrading of University
staff. Most of the new physical facilities are now in use. In response to
a new staff development plan prepared by the Government, the Association
has granted a final extension of the Closing Date (until December 31, 1979)
to allow for completion of equipment procurement and an ongoing fellowship
program for teaching staff.
Credit No. 422       Third Karachi Port:  US$18.0 Million Credit of July 19,
1973; Effective Date: December 14, 1973; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Credit No. 492       Fourth Karachi Port:  US$16.0 Million Credit of July 8,
1974; Effective Date: September 18, 1974; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Construction work on the Juna Bunder Berths is currently about
21 months behind schedule. Quay piling was substantially completed in June
1978 and shed construction is now scheduled for completion by September 1979.
The initial and subsequent delays in construction of the Napier Mole Bridge
will mean that completion is likely to be delayed until early 1981 - about
3 years behind schedule. Most of Credit 422 has been disbursed. Construc-
tion of the oil berth has been completed. Contracts for channel dredging
works and dredger procurement have been awarded by KPT. A study commissioned
by KPT will shortly put forward recommendations for rationalizing the port
tariff structure. An interim tariff increase averaging 100% was recently
approved by the Government.
Loan No. 1326        Development Finance Company - PICIC:  US$25.0 Million
Loan of September 14, 1976; Effective Date:
November 29, 1976; Closing Date: December 31, 1980
This loan has been fully committed and at end-August, 1979, disburse-
ments amounted to US$22.6 million.
Credit No. 510       Third Telecommunications:  US$36.0 Million Credit of
September 12, 1974; Effective Date: October 25, 1974;
Closing Date: December 31, 1979
The project covered by this Credit is proceeding reasonably satis-
factorily, but is about 12 months behind schedule. Procurement action for
all the main equipment items has been substantially completed, installation of
plant and equipment is making good progress, and about 70% of the additional
subscribers' lines are in service. As part of the project, T&T was to have
been reorganized so as to function more effectively along commercial lines



- 25 -
AIINEX II
and to have been given a greater degree of autonomy. This reorganization,
important to improving the efficiency of operation of the sector, was delayed
but has now been initiated. The Closing Date has been extended by one year
to December 31, 1979 to permit the project to be completed.
Credit No. 546        National Development Finance Corporation (NDFC):
US$30.0 Million Credit of May 15, 1975: Effective
Date July 17, 1975; Closing Date: November 30, 1980
The Credit has been fully committed and US$25.4 million had been
disbursed as of end-August, 1979. The Closing Date, originally September 30,
1979 has been postponed to November 30, 1980 on account of one sub-project.
Loan No. 1107         Fourth Sui Northern Gas:  US$60.0 Million Loan of
May 15, 1975; Effective Date: July 5, 1975; Closing
Date: December 31, 1979
Project activities are generally on schedule. A re-estimate of
final project costs (including the additional pipelines and distribution
systems authorized by the Bank) indicates savings in foreign ex,-hange expendi-
tures of about US$10.8 million. It is proposed to amend the project descrip-
tion to allow the Borrower to use about US$2.3 million of these savings
towards a larger pipeline between Meyal and Dhulian and dehydration facilities
for handling additional gas from the Meyal field.
Credit No. 620        Seed Project:  US$23.0 Million Credit of March 29, 1976;
Effective Date: November 29, 1976; Closing Date:
December 31, 1980
Physical progress of the project has slowed down in the last few
months, due primarily to inexperience of the Punjab and Sind Seed Corporations
(PSC and SSC) in dealing with local and foreign private contractors. Addi-
tionally, frequent changes in management of PSC have had adverse effects.
Despite good progress on Corporation farms, the quality of crops produced is
still severely constrained by the quality of the pre-basic seed provided by
the research institutions. The Government has responded to IDA's recommenda-
tions for changes to improve the situation. Commissioning of two of the PSC
seed plants is now scheduled for January 1980; the third will be delayed by
about six months.  The scheduled commissioning date for the SSC is August
1980.
Credit No. 630        Second Lahore Water Supply, Sewerage and Drainage
Project US$26.6 Million Credit of June 8, 1976; Effective
Date: September 21, 1976; Closing Date: December 31,
1980
The majority of works have been contracted after some design delay
and retendering. Construction is about 2 years behind schedule. Due to
this delay and general inflation, the project cost is estimated to have
increased by about 24%. The engineering consulting service financed by UNDP
is being strengthened and extended to cover the prolonged project period.

ANNEX II
Technical assistance provided by ODA (UK) for engineering and financial
management, leak detection and training has been reorganized to better meet
the needs of the project.
Loan No. 1208-T      Second WAPDA Power:  US$50.0 Million Third Window Loan
of February 19, 1976; Effective Date: April 30, 1976;
Closing Date: December 31, 1980
Construction of the 336-mile transmission line between Faisalabad
(formerly Lyallpur) and Guddu and installation of associated equipment is in
progress with completion scheduled for December 1980. Virtually all bidding
documents for equipment and materials have been issued and awards made on the
major items. Due to lower-than-expected prices, estimated savings of $15
million have been cancelled.
Credit No. 648       Khairpur-Il Tile Drainage and Irrigated Farming Development
Project: US$14.0 Million Credit of July 22, 1976;
Effective Date: March 14, 1977; Closing Date: July 31,
1982
Overall progress is about 21 months behind schedule due to delays
in achieving credit effectiveness. With the recent completion by WAPDA and
their consultants of the project plan report and construction of ancillary
works and facilities, WAPDA would be able to maintain consistent and season-
able progress in the critical task of the drain pipe installations after
delivery of most of the heavy equipment, which took place in mid-1979.
Credit No. 678      Third Education:  US$15.0 Million Credit of February 18,
1977; Effective Date: July 6, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
The project provides facilities for: (a) general teacher training
and an experiment in an adult functional literacy program and related studies;
and (b) agricultural education to assist in developing higher and middle level
agricultural manpower, farmer training and related studies. Project implemen-
tation is about five months behind schedule, but the project is now making
reasonable progress. The Educational Master Plan, covering manpower and
enrollment projections as well as other activities concerning future develop-
ment at Sind Agricultural University, was completed in April 1979. About 85%
of civil works contracts have been awarded and about one-third of the works
completed. Tendering for about one-half the project equipment is in progress
and the balance is expected to be tendered shortly. A technical assistance
contract was signed with UNESCO in early 1979 and recruitment is in progress.
Loan No. 1366-T    Punjab Livestock:  US$10.0 Million Loan of February 18,
1977; Effective Date: August 3, 1977; Closing Date:
December 31, 1982
Project implementation has been poor due to frequent changes in the
management of the Punjab Livestock Board (PLB). Lately, PLB has improved
the viability of the Lahore Milk Plant and has made progress in establishing



- 27 -
ANNEX II
Village Livestock Associations. Investments in abbatoir now appear unjusti-
fied and other components are being financed from other sources. The future
of the project is being reviewed with the Government. The Government has been
advised that construction of the milk plant will depend on the outcome of the
ongoing consultant's feasibility study and on PLB taking further action to
improve the viability of the existing facility.
Credit No. 751       Hill Farming Technical Development:  US$3.0 Million
Credit of December 1, 1977; Effective Date: March 7,
1978; Closing Date: September 30, 1981
This project is proceeding satisfactorily. Most of the construc-
tion has been completed or is nearing completion. The aerial survey has
been carried out; demonstration farms have been established; and the pilot
vegetable and apple schemes, forestry and livestock activities are operating
closely to the time schedule envisaged.
Credit No. 754       SCARP-VI:  US$70.0 Million Credit of January 19, 1978;
Effective Date: December 28, 1978; Closing Date:
June 30, 1985
The project is about one year behind schedule due to the delayed
appointment of consultants, who are assisting with project design and
implementation.
Credit No. 755       Hazara Forestry:  US$1.7 Million Credit of January 29,
1978; Effective Date: July 14, 1978; Closing Date:
December 31, 1983
There has been some progress in different project activities, but
implementation is still well behind schedule, notably in the silvicultural
work. Steps to improve this situation have been agreed with the project
authorities.
Credit No. 813       Punjab Extension and Agricultural Development:  US$12.5
Million Credit of June 6, 1978; Effective Date:
September 12, 1978; Closing Date: June 30, 1984
The project implementation plan has been finalized. A short delay
has occurred in appointing key staff. The T&V system is operating in the
project area and is also being implemented in the rest of the Province.
While some minor operational snags remain, general progress is satisfactory.
.
Credit No. 846       Fauji Fertilizer:  US$55.0 Million Credit of September 14,
1978; Effective Date: December 19, 1978;
Closing Date: June 30, 1982
Engineering and procurement are well advanced and site preparation
is underway. The marketing program is being implemented according to schedule
and construction of the housing colony at the project site is well underway.

Credit No. 867       Toot Oil and Gas Development:  US$30.0 Million Credit of
January 12, 1979; Effective Date: April 25, 1979;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981
The project is currently at an initial stage. The key drilling
component has encountered some difficulty; special technical consultants will
help correct technical problems. A new drilling contract will be entered
into in early 1980.
Credit No. 877       Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP) Mardan:
US$60.0 Million Credit of February 7, 1979; Effective
Date: October 16, 1979; Closing Date: June 30, 1986
Consultants to assist WAPDA in the preparation of detailed designs,
specifications and procurement documents have been appointed. The Credit
has just been declared effective.
Credit No. 892      Primary Education:  US$10.0 Million Credit of April 18, 1979;
Effective Date: October 23, 1979; Closing Date: June 30,
1985
The Credit has just been declared effective. Consultants for training
and evaluation components have been engaged.
Credit No. 922       Sind Agricultural Extension and Adaptive Research Project:
US$9.0 Million Credit of June 12, 1979; Closing Date:
