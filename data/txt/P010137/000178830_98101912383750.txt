PAKISTAN
THIRD WAPDA POWER PROJECT
I. THE POWER SECTOR
Background
1.01      An efficient, sound and broad-based power supply system is basic
to the social and economic development of Pakistan. Since 1959 power gener-
ation capacity in Pakistan has increased 20 fold, from a meagre 174 megawatts
to 3,660 megawatts (1979), of which hydro capacity accounts for 46 percent and
thermal capacity for the remaining 54 percent. Power consumption per capita
in Pakistan has increased nearly 74 fold, from an insignificant 2 kWh/capita
in 1947 when the country came into being, to 147 kWh/capita today, and it is
likely to rise to 225 kWh/capita by 1983. Since 1959 the number of consumers
has shown a seven-fold increase and revenue from the sale of electricity has
multiplied more than eighteen times.
1.02      Total hydro potential in Pakistan is estimated at about 40,000 MW
of which about 10,000 MW could be developed economically. With the full
development of the Tarbela, Mangla and Warsak projects by 1985, there will
be in operation about 3,300 MW of hydro power. The geographical configuration
of Pakistan is such that hydro stations are located in the mountainous north
while thermal power stations are in the flatter center and south. Thermal
stations play an important role in meeting power needs of the country through-
out the year and in supplementing supplies in the northern grid during low
water months (March-May). During the high water months (July-September) when
hydro energy capability is at its maximum, power is transmitted south enabling
thermal stations to economize on fuel and to carry out phased overhauling and
maintenance.
1.03      During the period 1978/79 through 1982/83 the scheduled commission-
ing of additional thermal and hydro generating plants by the Water and Power
Development Authority (WAPDA) will increase its capacity from 2,685 MW to
3,950 MW and a large program of extension and reinforcement of its 220 kV,
132 kV and 66 kV transmission networks will be required to improve the voltage
situation and reduce losses as well as to supply the new loads. The Govern-
ment of Pakistan (GOP) has asked the Association to assist in financing the
last four years of this transmission reinforcement and development program.
An IDA Credit of US$45 million is proposed as part of a financing plan to
which the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the Canadian International Development
Agency (CIDA), Kreditandstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of Germany and the Euro-
pean Economic Community (EEC) are also expected to contribute (see paragraph
4.06).
Previous Bank Group Involvement in the Sector
1.04      The proposed credit would be the Bank Group's third lending operation
to WAPDA for power. There has also been previous participation in the Indus
Basin Development Project, including Mangla and Tarbela, and a series of four
loans/credits were made to the Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, Ltd. (KESC)



-2-
between 1955 and 1967 for generation facilities. The first credit for WAPDA
of US$23 million (Credit 213-PAK) was made in 1970 to finance a project to
augment the transmission substation capacity of the power system. Although
late by about three years, the project has now been completed. A second
lending operation for WAPDA power, a Third Window loan (Loan 1208T-PAK) of
US$50 million (subsequently reduced by US$15 million due to savings achieved
under international competitive bidding) was made in 1975 to finance part
of a 500 kV transmission system to eventually create the backbone of a high
voltage grid connecting the hydro resources of the north with the thermal
generation in the center and south to provide the most economic means of
supplying power throughout the country.  The start of the project was delayed
by about nine months due to late employment of consultants and slowness in
awarding contracts. Despite this delay, the project is now proceeding
satisfactorily.
Energy Resources
1.05      The energy sector is described in detail in Annex 1; energy resources
in Pakistan are described briefly in the following paragraphs.
1.06      Pakistan's domestic energy resources are characterized by sizeable
reserves of natural gas, substantial hydro potential, but only limited known
reserves of crude oil and exploitable coal, and no uranium. Thus, while hydro
and natural gas have been developed extensively and now account for one half
of total energy requirements, indigenous coal and crude oil supply a much
smaller proportion of the requirements. As in most countries in South Asia,
a large part of internal energy requirements are still met by non-commercial
energy sources stich as firewood, animal dung, bagasse and maize stalks, which
constitute the bulk of energy supplies in rural areas.
1.07      Natural gas which was first discovered in the mid-fifties has been
an important component of Pakistan's primary energy resources.  Total proven
"recoverable" reserves are estimated at 9.0 trillion cubic feet (225 million
tons of oil equivalent) of which about 18.5% has been used. Recent discoveries,
still to be fully evaluated, could raise reserves to about 17 trillion cubic
feet which would meet foreseeable internal demand until at least the year 2000.
1.08      Extensive coal deposits have been identified but the quality is
generally poor, having a high ash and sulphur content and a low heating value.
The largest known coal field is at Lakhra, producing coal of a quality suit-
able only for mine-head power generation. Proven recoverable reserves are
currently estimated at between 150-170 million tons (65-75 million tons of
oil equivalent).
1.09      Due to the slow pace of exploration activity, oil reserves are not
precisely determined and estimates vary widely even for oil fields already
in production. Estimates of recoverable reserves range from 35 million to
400 million barrels (4.8 million tons to 55 million tons). Production is
limited to six fields and is currently (1977/78) about 9,900 barrels/day
(0.45 million tons/year) and covers 13% of current requirements. The produc-
tion target for 1982/83 is 36,800 barrels/day which would translate into an
average annual growth rate of about 30% p.a.



-3-
1.10      Until recently liquid petroleum gas (LPG) was a relatively unimport-
ant by-product of crude oil refining. In 1976 production totalled about
22,000 tons and it is estimated that by 1982/83 about 236,000 tons could be
produced. Indications are that substantial surpluses would exist by 1982/83.
1.11      With regard to hydro resources, a large part of the hydro potential
is located on the Indus and Jhelum rivers in the north. This potential has
been estimated at about 25,000 MW, of which 1,567 MW has been exploited to
date. In the period 1978/79 - 1982/83 an additional 1,330 MW will be
installed so that by 1982/83 about 12% of the potential will be exploited.
1.12      The larger unexploited hydro sites identified to date are about
18 totalling about 17,000 MW and ranging in size from 110 MW - 2,000 MW. To
further improve available information on the hydro potential and to assist
future planning of generating facilities, WAPDA will carry out a study, sup-
plemented by field investigation, to rank identified hydro sites according to
technical and economic merit. A feasibility study of the 1,760 MW Kalabagh
site on the Indus river downstream of Tarbela is also planned.
1.13      Smaller hydro sites in the range of 100-200 kW are numerous but
costs/kW are high. The Technology Development Organization of GOP is working
on micro hydro plants with the objective of developing an indigenous tech-
nology with simple design, low costs, and civil works that can be carried
out by the local people who would benefit from the plants.
Sector Organization
1.14      The two main Acts pertaining to the power sector are the Electricity
Act of 1910 (as modified in 1964) and the Water and Power Development Authority
(WAPDA) Act of 1958. The Electricity Act is a statutory instrument governing
the sector and inter alia enables the Government to issue licenses for the
generation and distribution of electric power in various areas of the country.
Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA)
1.15      The WAPDA Act inter alia confers on WAPDA the power and obligations
of a licensee under the Electricity Act. Under the Indus Water Treaty of 1960
between India and Pakistan, WAPDA was designated as the agency responsible for
implementing a series of civil engineering works to aid in the replacement
of river flows diverted to irrigation uses in India. The extensive program
of works known as the Indus Basin Project is of a multipurpose nature and
includes a large power component. The Project includes two of the largest
earth-rockfill storage dams in the world at Mangla and Tarbela permitting the
installation of 800 MW of generating capacity at Mangla and 2,100 MW at Tarbela
(Map IBRD 11215 R2).
1.16      Agricultural development in the Indus Basin and WAPDA's power system
are closely related, with irrigation pumps absorbing 27% of the power systems
output, thus depending heavily on the generating capacity of Mangla and
Tarbela.



- 4 -
1.17      WAPDA is the major partner in the power sector, accounting for 80%
of the public power supply in Pakistan. At the end of 1978/79 WAPDA's in-
stalled capacity totalled 2,685 MW of which 1,567 MW were hydro, 715 MW
steam thermal, and 403 MW gas turbines, to serve 2.53 million consumers.
Karachi Electric Supply Corporation, Ltd (KESC)
1.18      Under the Electricity Act KESC was granted a license to generate
and distribute electric power in the Karachi area. KESC is a private stock
company with GOP directly holding 40% of the shares and Government controlled
banks and insurance companies holding 30%. The remaining share capital is
held by private individuals.
1.19      KESC accounts for the remaining 20% of the public power supply in
Pakistan. At the end of 1978/79 KESC's installed capacity totalled 745 MW
of which 493 MW were steam thermal, 137 MW nuclear, 100 MW gas turbines and
15 MW diesel. KESC presently serves about 310,000 consumers in Karachi and
its environs.
Others
1.20      Similarly, various other licenses were conferred under the Electricity
Act to various companies for distribution of electricity purchased in bulk from
WAPDA. Bulk purchases from WAPDA for this purpose account for about 13% of
WAPDA's sales. The principal licencees distributing power generated by WAPDA
are: (i) the Multan Electric Supply Company (MESCO); and (ii) the Rawalpindi
Electric Power Company (REPCO). In addition licenses are issued for the instal-
lation of captive generating plant, mainly for industrial purposes. The total
installed capacity of such plant amounted to about 230 MW at the end of 1978/79.
The Power Market (WAPDA and KESC)
1.21      At the end of 1976/77 the combined maximum demand of WAPDA and KESC
totalled 2,003 MW; generation amounted to 10,742 Gwh and sales to 7,150 Gwh.
Based on those figures the average annual load factor was 61.2% and system
losses were high at 3,592 Gwh or 33.4% of generation.
1.22      The total number of consumers served were 2,325,000 (2,015,000 by
WAPDA and 310,000 by KESC). This would indicate, on the assumption of 7
persons/consumer and a population of 74 million (1976/77), that the benefits
of electricity were available directly to about 22% of the population.
1.23      During the period 1970/71-1976/77 the average annual growth rate of
generation and sales of electricity in Pakistan was 6.9% and 5.1% respectively
and of maxium demand 10%. Annual growth rates, however, varied considerably:
generation, 1.9%-12%; sales, 1.6%-10.5%; and maximum demand 2.4%-13.7%. Losses
in the period under review increased from 26.4% of generation in 1970/71 to
33.4% in 1976/77. As a consequence, the average annual generation growth rate
exceeds the sales growth rate. The load factor varied from a high of 69.7 in
1970/71 to 61.2 in 1976/77. For a system with the characteristics found in
Pakistan an average load factor of 62% is not unreasonable. The higher load
factor in 1970/71 through 1975/76 is attributable to load shedding during the



- 5 -
peak demand periods because of inadequate generating facilities to meet the
peak. This restriction, which was lifted in 1976/77 resulted in the lower
load factor in that year and accounts for the substantial growth in maximum
demand in 1976/77 over 1975/76 of 13.7%, affecting the average annual demand
growth rate for the period under review. Table 1.1 shows the annual develop-
ment of the power market.

Forecast Growth of Demand and Energy
1.24      The forecasts presented in this report are based on data provided
by GOP but they differ from the official forecasts prepared by the Planning
Commission and the two utilities. The official forecast depended on the
successful implementation of programs in various sectors of the economy as
well as on the availability of finance to achieve the desired objectives.
Following discussions between the mission and the Government it was mutually
agreed that the basic assumptions which were made have proven too ambitious.
For instance, generation and sales of electricity in 1975/76 and 1976/77,
were seriously affected by industrial stagnation, weather conditions which
affected agriculture production, and political unrest. While an improvement
is expected over the next four years, it is unlikely that previously set
targets can be met. A factor which influences the forecast was the growth
in generation and sales in 1977/78 of 19.0% and 17.5% respectively. This
sudden growth took place because of the commissioning of new units at Tarbela
and additional units at Karachi with the resultant elimination of previous
power rationing. Such growth is not expected to continue in future years.
A growth rate in sales of about 13% per annum has been forecast for the short
term and taking into account a reduction of losses from 34.5% of generation
(1977/78) to 21.6% (1982/83) and an average annual load factor stabilized at
62%, generation and maximum demand are forecast to grow at about 9% per annum.
This is demonstrated in Table 1.2. The revisions made would allow the post-
ponement of the commissioning of some of the thermal plant, which was within
the investment program, beyond 1982/83 (see footnote to para 1.30).

1.25      The above forecast to 1982/83, which was prepared by WAPDA and
reviewed by the mission, is adequate for the purpose of short term planning
but the current economic situation and the uncertainty underlying the forecast
make it essential that a revised longer term, and more detailed forecast be
prepared by WAPDA, KESC and the Planning Commission at the earliest opportu-
nity (see para 3.14). Such a forecast should take into account the result of
the fuel pricing study to be made in connection with the Toot Oil Project
(Credit 867-PAK), the gas utilization study which is being carried out, the
electricity tariff study discussed in Chapter III and realistic plans for
economic development, tubewell electrification and rural electrification.
These matters were discussed during negotiations and GOP agreed to carry out
such a long term forecast, based on accepted methodology, together with WAPDA
and KESC, and the results of the forecast would be reviewed with the Asso-
ciation by June 30, 1980. It was further agreed during negotiations that,
based on the results of the forecast, GOP would consult with the Association,
by December 31, 1980 on the size and composition of its investment programs
in the power sector.
Existing Facilities

about 230 MW of private generating facilities) is summarized below:

located in the center and in the south.



peak demand periods because of inadequate generating facilities to meet the
peak. This restriction, which was lifted in 1976/77 resulted in the lower
load factor in that year and accounts for the substantial growth in maximum
demand in 1976/77 over 1975/76 of 13.7%, affecting the average annual demand
growth rate for the period under review. Table 1.1 shows the annual develop-
ment of the power market.

Forecast Growth of Demand and Energy
1.24      The forecasts presented in this report are based on data provided
by GOP but they differ from the official forecasts prepared by the Planning
Commission and the two utilities. The official forecast depended on the
successful implementation of programs in various sectors of the economy as
well as on the availability of finance to achieve the desired objectives.
Following discussions between the mission and the Government it was mutually
agreed that the basic assumptions which were made have proven too ambitious.
For instance, generation and sales of electricity in 1975/76 and 1976/77,
were seriously affected by industrial stagnation, weather conditions which
affected agriculture production, and political unrest. While an improvement
is expected over the next four years, it is unlikely that previously set
targets can be met. A factor which influences the forecast was the growth
in generation and sales in 1977/78 of 19.0% and 17.5% respectively. This
sudden growth took place because of the commissioning of new units at Tarbela
and additional units at Karachi with the resultant elimination of previous
power rationing. Such growth is not expected to continue in future years.
A growth rate in sales of about 13% per annum has been forecast for the short
term and taking into account a reduction of losses from 34.5% of generation
(1977/78) to 21.6% (1982/83) and an average annual load factor stabilized at
62%, generation and maximum demand are forecast to grow at about 9% per annum.
This is demonstrated in Table 1.2. The revisions made would allow the post-
ponement of the commissioning of some of the thermal plant, which was within
the investment program, beyond 1982/83 (see footnote to para 1.30).

1.25      The above forecast to 1982/83, which was prepared by WAPDA and
reviewed by the mission, is adequate for the purpose of short term planning
but the current economic situation and the uncertainty underlying the forecast
make it essential that a revised longer term, and more detailed forecast be
prepared by WAPDA, KESC and the Planning Commission at the earliest opportu-
nity (see para 3.14). Such a forecast should take into account the result of
the fuel pricing study to be made in connection with the Toot Oil Project
(Credit 867-PAK), the gas utilization study which is being carried out, the
electricity tariff study discussed in Chapter III and realistic plans for
economic development, tubewell electrification and rural electrification.

Existing Facilities
1.26      The total installed capacity in Pakistan at June 30, 1979 (excluding
about 230 MW of private generating facilities) is summarized below:
Installed Capacity (MW)
Hydro   Steam   Nuclear   Gas Turbine   Diesel   Total
WAPDA              1,567    715        -           403           -      2,685

located in the center and in the south.



-7-
1.27      WAPDA and KESC are presently interconnected by two 132 kV trans-
mission lines of limited capacity which do not allow for substantial power
interchanges. By 1977/78 the total length of WAPDA's primary and secondary
transmission line was about 8,800 miles (14,160 km) of which only 9% was, at
that time, at 220 kV. The bulk of the transmission system length was at 132
kV, 66 kV and 33 kV (56% was at 66 kV and 33 kV). The 11 kV distribution
lines had a total length of about 35,300 miles (56,800 km).
1.28      At the same time WAPDA had in service a total of 334 substations
with an installed transformer capacity of 6,949 MVA. Of these, 196 (1,634
MVA) were at the 66/33 kV, 66/11 kV and 33/11 kV level; 132 (3,516 MWA) at
the 132/66 kV and 132/11 kV level; and 6 (1,799 MVA) at the 220/132 kV level.
1.29      Thus, 132 kV facilities and lower account for 91% of transmission
lines and 98% of substations.
Future Development
1.30      The sector expansion program for the Fifth Plan (1978/79-1982/83)
has been modified by GOP 1/ to conform to the mission's load forecast and
assumes an effective loss reduction program. The generation expansion pro-
gram includes: hydro 980 MW (WAPDA); thermal 410 MW (WAPDA 210 MW; KESC 200
MW) and gas turbines 350 MW (WAPDA 125 MW; KESC 225 MW) for a total of 1,740
MW, increasing installed capacity to 5,020 MW and low water capability from
2,550 MW to 3,700 MW. Reserve capacity during low water months would vary
between 90 MW in March 1979 to about 220 MW in March 1983. With the exception
of March 1980, when there is no reserve capacity, it is adequate and reasonable
in subsequent years. Private generating capacity is expected to increase from
230 MW to about 400 MW.
1.31      Expansion and rehabilitation of transmission and distribution systems
are vital to achieve the objectives set by the government. Extra High Voltage
(EHV) system studies carried out by Meta Systems of Canada have shown justifi-
cation for a 500 kV transmission system which should be built from Tarbela
to the Hyderabad/Karachi area in order to fully integrate the hydro-electric
sources in the North with the thermal plants and market in the Center and
South. Such an interconnection would allow the full use of the hydro capa-
bility during the high water months (July-September) and would give thermal
support to the system from the Center and the South during low water months
(March-May). This interconnection, which constitutes a "bulk power expressway",
would also reduce fuel expenses (for spinning reserves) and generating capacity
requirements through the pooling of the reserves of WAPDA and KESC.
1.32      During the period 1978/79-1982/83 two 500 kV lines will be completed
from Tarbela to Faisalabad (the first is already operational and the second
will be operational in 1982/83). Financing is being provided by the
1/   Modifications include postponing beyond 1982/83 some of the proposed
thermal developments (including the proposed nuclear plant - see para
3.17) and dropping some of the proposed gas turbine plant from the
program.



Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA). One of these lines will
be extended from Faisalabad to Hyderabad/Karachi, with intermediate sub-
stations at Multan and Guddu, for completion in 1982/83. Initial operation
is envisaged at 220 kV. Financing of this line is being provided by Loan
1208T-PAK and by the Kuwait Fund. The entire 500 kV interconnection will be
converted to 500 kV operation with the commissioning of the last Tarbela unit -
unit 12 - scl,"-d f i aarly  98C5.
1.33      In addition a substantial prograrm to extend, to convert to higher
voltage, and to reinforce the 220 kV, 132 kV and 66 kV system is required.
These secondary transmission systems are essential to improve voltage condi-
tions, reduce losses, and to supply new loads.
1.34      Distribution systems will also need to be reinforced and expanded
to enable the connection of about one million new consumers during the Fifth
Plan.  By 1982/83, this will bring the benefits of electricity to about 27%
of the population, compared to 22% in 1976/77.

II. THE BENEFICIARY
Legal Status and Authority
2.01      The beneficiary would be WAPDA, a semi-autonomous government agency
chartered in 1958 to provide for the unified and coordinated development of
the water and power resources of the country. WAPDA also has responsibility
for executing the Indus Basin Project which includes the two multi-purpose
storage dams at Mangla and Tarbela. While as a government agency, WAPDA has
no share capital and pays no income taxes, it has been remitting to Government
an annual amount of PRs 20 million in payment for assets transferred from
Government during the early years of WAPDA's formation.
2.02      The Act establishing WAPDA conferred on it unusually broad powers
to carry out its work. While these have been somewhat eroded over the years
by Government regulations, WAPDA still retains a good deal of autonomy.
However, any change in tariffs requires Government approval and, like all
state enterprises in Pakistan, its investment plans and annual capital
budgets have to be approved by the Government. WAPDA's supervisory agency
is the Ministry of Water and Power.
Organization and Management
2.03      WAPDA is organized into two "wings":
(a)  Power Wing:  Responsible for construction and operation of
power generation, transmission and distribution facilities
throughout the country, except for the Karachi area which
is served by KESC and various small licensees which buy
in bulk from WAPDA and distribute.
(b)  Water Wing:  Responsible for the overall planning of water
resources; water utilization and measures to combat water-
logging and salinity; and detailed planning, investigations
and design of surface and groundwater projects.
The two wings function largely independently of each other, each headed by
a Managing Director who is also a Member of the Authority (para 2.07). The
Water Wing constructs projects on behalf of the Federal and Regional Govern-
ments and upon completion turns them over to these bodies for operation. The
Power Wing constructs generation, transmission and distribution facilities,
and also operates these systems from generation to ultimate consumer.
2.04      The Power Wing is under the Member, Power in his capacity as
Managing Director. He has under him six General Managers respectively in
charge of generation; transmission and grid stations; distribution; planning,
design and protection; stores; and coordination. Each General Manager has a
number of Chief Engineers responsible for various departments. WAPDA's
organizational chart is shown in Annex 3.



- 10 -
2.05      Since 1960 WAPDA has substantially completed the Indus Basin pro-
jects and has significantly developed both water and power resources. During
this period the operational side of the Power Wing, that is the generation,
transmission, distribution and sale of electricity, has emerged as a major
responsibility in terms of management effort and finances administered.
This change in emphasis, from development to power system operations serving
more than two million customers, has been an evolutionary process and the
few ad hoc modifications in the organization to meet this change have not
been fully successful. Concentration on development at the expense of
operations has resulted in limited emphasis on commercial and financial
management, a lack of clearly stated operational objectives and insufficient
management effort directed to the Power Wing's commercial operations.
2.06      Legacies of this history are two major weaknesses that require
correcting:
(a) the low level that the financial function occupies
within WAPDA; and
(b) the lack of competent financial staff.
These weaknesses are related: because the financial function has been rele-
gated to a relatively low level, there is a generally low caliber of staff
and little productive work. What information does flow from the accounting
staff is viewed by management with skepticism as to its reliability. This
role of finance has precluded WAPDA from attracting qualified, competent
financial staff.
2.07      WAPDA's most senior body, referred to as the Authority (normally
known as a board), consists of the Chairman and Members Power, Water and
Finance; all are Government appointees. The Act implies that the Authority
is to be a policy making body; however, over the years it has been drawn into
day-to-day operations so that in fact its members operate as the senior
managers, reserving to themselves all substantive decisions as well as many
of lesser importance which has tended to delay the decision making process.
In an attempt to streamline management, the Members, Power, Water and Finance
were designated Managing Directors to function as the chief executives of
their respective organizations below board level. This was a step in the right
direction, but it has been largely frustrated by the rapid turnover in Members
of the Authority, and by the lack of a reporting system to provide managers
with reliable and meaningful information for monitoring their operations and
areas of responsibility. During the last eight years there have been four
Chairmen and five Members each for Power and Finance. Members of the Authority
and Government officials in Islamabad agree that this constant change is not
in the best interests of WAPDA.
2.08      In line with WAPDA's consultant's recommendations (para 2.14),
IDA has proposed to WAPDA that it take early action to strengthen the Power
Wing's financial organization by:
(a) creating the post of General Manager, Finance (ranking
equal to other General Managers) and sufficiently senior



finance posts in each of the three operating groups
(generation, transmission and distribution); and
(b) recruiting competent staff to fill these four posts.
WAPDA has advised that these posts have been created and that the three opera-
tional groups' posts have been filled.  While WAPDA has had difficulty in
recruiting a suitable General Manager, Finance due to the salary scale that
WAPDA is able to offer, it is understood that it has recently succeeded in
locating what appears to be a suitable applicant for the position, but who
would need a period of about a year for familiarization with WAPDA's operations.
The present proposal is to utilize WAPDA's current consultant in the post as
a specialist advisor simultaneously with his supervision of implementation of
the new accounting system until the above applicant or a suitable alternative
is finally recruited and has had time to properly settle in the position.
The specialist advisor would be closely involved in the financial operations
of the Power Wing, lending strong support to the financial general manager
who would initially be appointed General Manager, Finance Designate. During
negotiations it was agreed that the services of the specialist advisor for
finance would continue to be provided by the present consultants under a
contract with terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. Also, during negotia-
tions IDA discussed with Government the matter of rapid turnover in senior
management and an understanding was reached that an endeavor would be made
to reduce the past rapid turnover of occupants of senior posts. Increasing
continuity of senior staff and strengthening the financial function to pro-
vide meaningful management reports should promote and facilitate decentral-
ization in decision-making.
2.09      With the continued expansion of the Power Wing and the diversity
in the nature of the operations of the two wings, their separation should
be considered. However, given the magnitude and nature of WAPDA's problems
at this time and the consultant's recommendations for reshaping the Power
Wing's operations along commercial lines (para 2.14), it is believed that
this is not the time for an immediate and fundamental revision of the entity's
structure. Therefore, for the time being the present WAPDA organization
combining the two wings would be acceptable. At a later stage however serious
consideration should be given to the separation of the two wings, which has
been a recommendation of previous studies.
2.10      There have been indications that Government was considering creating
four federal organizations, one in each province, and transferring all distri-
bution facilities and part of the transmission system from WAPDA to these
organizations, but this appears to be dormant at this time. WAPDA and Gov-
ernment have been reminded that, in accordance with agreements reached under
Loan 1208T-PAK, before any change of this nature the Bank is to be notified
in sufficient time for an exchange of views. During negotiations this agree-
ment was reiterated in the legal documents.
Accounting
2.11      The Power Wing maintains separate accounts to reflect its operations;
however, the present accounting system is based on the one that existed in



- 12 -
the Government's Public Works Department and is designed to account for cash
expenditure without regard for commercial considerations. It is inadequate
for providing a service to management for monitoring costs, measuring perform-
ance or assessing progress against a budget.
2.12      The two departments providing accounting service have been:
(a)  Chief Accountant WAPDA (CAW), resporsible for construction
accounting and the recording of head office expenditure;
and
(b)  Chief Accountant Power (CAP), responsible for operations
accounting, including distribution and minor generation
and transmission expenditures.
Tpe accounting organization has been confused by there being two departments
overlapping in responsibility and reporting to different. members of management.
The CAW and CAP each has been accounting for different aspects of Generation
and Transmission. The CAW has been reporting to the Member, Finance while the
CAP has been reporting to the General Manager, Distribution, although he is
also the accountant for Generation and Transmission. The lack of an inte-
grated accounting function for the Power Wing has not allowed sound financial
management. WAPDA is now taking steps to correct this situation by beginning
to establish an accounting organization along the lines recommended by its
consultants.
2.13      The same lack of consistency that has characterized the organiza-
tional structure is found in the systems of accounting, where the confusion
results from ad hoc changes to the Public Works Department and government
accounting procedures which have resulted in a hybrid system, neither
government-type nor commercially-oriented. It is conceptually difficult to
understand and ill-suited to the Power Wing's accounting and managerial
requirements.
Management/Accounting Improvements
2.14      As part of the project financed under Loan 1208T-PAK, WAPDA engaged
consultants (Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co.) to make a study of the WAPDA
Power Wing in order to make recommendations for improving its operations.
The consultants have carried out an in-depth study of the organization, man-
agement and accounting practices of the wing and have made sound recommenda-
tions for redirecting the operations more along commercial lines. The major
recommendations include strengthening the financial function through creating
certain senior finance posts and recruiting suitably qualified financial staff
to fill them, establishing an accounting system consistent with modern public
utility practices and designing an effective management reporting system
suitable for the Power Wing.
2.15      The consultancy assignment included the implementation phase, but
because of delays in carrying out the first part of the assignment due to
conceptual problems with new approaches and the need for time consuming com-
mittee discussion of changes in deeply rooted methods and procedures, the



- 13 -
consultancy contract expired before implementation could commence. However,
WAPDA has now retained the same consulting firm to assist with the imple-
mentation.
2.16      There is a great amount of work to be done in the financial/
accounting area in order for WAPDA to begin operating according to sound
financial and management principles. Arising from the work carried out by
the consultants, attention should be directed towards and priority given to
the following five areas of work:
(a)  the commercial and accounting procedures recommended by
the consultants and agreed with WAPDA should be implemented;
(b) a system of financial planning and control should be intro-
duced;
(c) the recommendations contained in the consultant's report on
"Stores Management" dated July 19, 1977 should be carried out;
(d) the work currently in progress on fixed asset accounting
should be completed; and
(e) project expenditure recording should be improved to ensure
better financial control and accountability on large invest-
ments.
During negotations agreement was reached that implementation of the above
systems and procedures would be completed by June 30, 1980.
Staff and Training
2.17      WAPDA is one of the largest employers in Pakistan.  Its permanent
staff numbered about 66,000 at June 30, 1978. Including contractors and
temporary labor the number would be about 82,000. Of this total, approxi-
mately 57,000 or 70% are attached to the Power Wing, including some 1,200
engineers. When compared to some other power utilities elsewhere in the
world, the number of Power Wing staff is large in relation to the number of
electricity customers.
2.18      The Power Wing's main training facility presently in operation is
the Training Institute at Faisalabad where basic training is given to junior
engineers, line superintendents, and sub-station staff in design, construc-
tion, maintenance and protection of distribution, transmission and grid
systems. A class of line superintendents is also trained exclusively in con-
struction of distribution lines and sub-stations. Each course is of sixteen
weeks duration. There is also some training in accounts under the general
supervision of the Chief Accountant, Power involving both classes and on-the-
job training. During the last few years, WAPDA's training program has been
allowed to slip so that its effectiveness is questionable. The present
Chairman however recognizes the value of an effective training program and
is taking steps to revitalize and broaden it.



- 14 -
2.19      Arrangements have been made with CIDA to send a specialist team to
Pakistan to give technicians and engineers on-the-job training and a CIDA
reconnaissance mission was in Pakistan during the period October/November
1979 to investigate WAPDA's needs for training expertise in maintenance and
operational techniques.
2.20      Training schemes have been sanctioned to set up five training
centers in the Power Wing's Generation Department, which has been without a
formalized training program. A center is being established at each of the
hydro stations at Mangla and Tarbela, at each of the steam power stations at
Multan and Guddu, and at the gas turbine power station at Nishatabad.  These
centers will provide training for new engineers and technicians in hydro and
thermal generation. Also refresher courses will be given to the engineering
and technical staff. Lecture halls and libraries have been provided at each
center and quarters are being constructed to accommodate the staff to be sent
from the power stations for training.
2.21      Other training arrangements include a new facility that is being
established at Tarbela for the training of officers of all categories, from
general manager/chief engineer down to junior engineers, in management,
finance and engineering disciplines. Five training centers are being opened
at Peshawar, Hyderabad, Shalamar, Sahiwal and Sargodha where the linesmen
from throughout the system will be given field training.
2.22      One of the more effective forms of training in the areas of manage-
ment and accounting will be through the consultants who will be assisting in
implementing the new systems (para 2.15). The consultants will attempt to
involve the maximum number of WAPDA staff which will not only ensure that
as many persons as possible will be familiar with the new procedures but
will provide a good source for developing a training cadre within WAPDA.
Billing and Collection
2.23      According to WAPDA's records it has managed to keep its accounts
receivable at about three months' level of billings, which is not unsatisfac-
tory. WAPDA's present system of accounts however does not permit a meaningful
analysis of accounts receivable; the age of the arrears is not ascertainable
and any management reports covering this area are out of date by the time they
are issued and suspect as to reliability. It does, however, appear that the
calculation of bills, whether manual or by computer, is reasonably efficient,
though the manual system is very labor intensive and subject to clerical
errors. Billing and collection are areas in which the consultants have made
recommendations for improvement so that a timely and meaningful analsyis can
be made and appropriate action taken to correct deficiencies.
2.24      Collections from private consumers are not a problem while those
from Government are, with the latter estimated to have amounted to about 40%
of total receivables at April 30, 1979. WAPDA shows Government receivables
at this date as amounting to PRs 211 million (US$21 million equivalent).
During negotiations assurances were obtained that Government would ensure
the settlement by all Government agencies and departments of their current
electricity bills within three months after receipt of the bills, and settle



- 15 -
their arrears owing to WAPDA as of September 30, 1979 by no later than
March 31, 1980. Steps to effect these undertakings were discussed. The
Pakistan Delegation agreed that, if necessary, the Federal and Provincial
Governments would deduct the amounts owed to WAPDA by Government agencies
from the funds allocated in the budgets for these agencies and pay these
amounts to WAPDA by March 31, 1980. It further agreed that the Government
would ensure that adequate provisions were made in the budgets of Federal
and Provincial agencies for the payment of current bills.
Audit
2.25      Under the WAPDA Act, the Auditor General (AG) of Pakistan is respon-
sible for auditing the Authority's accounts.  He discharges hs responsibility
through one of his special groups, the Director WAPDA Audit, which employs
some 400 staff. They are attached to WAPDA on a permanent basis and are
located at all points of its operations. Under Loan 1208T-PAK it was agreed
to accept temporarily the AG as the independent auditor since WAPDA's account-
ing system was so deficient that a judgment could not be made as to the quality
of the Government audit. The Bank however reserved the right to monitor the
present audit arrangements and, if necessary, to ask that an additional in-
dependent auditor be appointed. Present arrangements are that the Preliminary
Audit Observations together with the balance sheet, income statement and any
other relevant statements of the Power Wing are accepted for the time being
as satisfying the Bank's audit requirements. The observations are normally
issued within four to six months of the close of the fiscal year.
2.26      Under the present circumstances, it is recommended that the exist-
ing audit arrangements continue for the time being, until WAPDA's accounts
are in a state that will enable a judgment to be made on the quality of the
Government audit. A target date for this coincides with the timetable agreed
on priority areas of work cited in para 2.16, which includes an improved system
of accounting. Regarding the financial statements and the Preliminary Audit
Observations, it was confirmed during negotiations that these would be furnished
to the Association within six months of the fiscal year end.
Insurance
2.27      Prior to July 1, 1977 WAPDA had been carrying insurance with the
National Insurance Corporation of Pakistan (NIC), a Government irsurance agency
under the Ministry of Commerce. Over the years WAPDA experienced difficulty
in settling its claims with NIC and decided to self-insure its major equip-
ment with effect from July 1, 1977. It is currently allocating PRs 7 million
to an insurance reserve fund. During negotiations, it was agreed that WAPDA's
Power Wing would develop an insurance program consistent with sound public
utility practice. To this end, the Power Wing, with outside assistance, would
review the matter of insurance, including, inter alia, making an analysis of
WAPDA's exposure to possible risks, estimate the amount of losses that WAPDA
is willing and able to assume, and then develop an insurance program accord-
ingly. It was further agreed that IDA would be provided with the results of
the review by March 31, 1980, and that the new insurance program would be
established by September 30, 1980.

III. WAPDA'S PROGRAM
3.01      The general outline of the sector's program was covered in Chapter I
of this report and considered WAPDA and KESC as a combined system. With the
conversion to 500 kV operations of the transmission "expressway" from Tarbela
to Karachi by 1985, a viable integration of the WAPDA and KESC systems will
have been achieved. As from 1985 onwards, to fully achieve the benefits of
this integration, both systems should be operated in such a manner that the
total costs of the two systems are minimized. To achieve this objective, con-
sideration might therefore be given, in due course, to merge WAPDA's Power Wing
and KESC.
Existing WAPDA System
3.02      Before the commissioning of the first four Tarbela units (700 MW),
in 1976/77, the installed capacity of WAPDA totalled 1,935 MW made up of hydro,
867 MW, steam thermal, 715 MW and gas turbines, 353 MW. The net capability of
these plants during the low water months was about 1,475 MW and the estimated
peak demand was 1,620 MW. Severe rationing of power and load shedding was
taking place whenever units were out of service for repair.
3.03      Transmission lines at 220 kV connected Tarbela, Burhan, Mangla,
Lahore, Faisalabad and Multan. All other transmission was at 132 kV and
66 kV. The length of these lines and the loads carried at these voltages are
excessive, causing part of the high system losses described in paragraph 1.23.
It may be noted that the transport capability (MW) of a transmission line for
a given distance (miles) increases about 5 times when the transmission voltage
is doubled and enables losses to be reduced by about 75%.
3.04      Distribution at the 11 kV level also  has high losses due to the
excessive length and loading of circuits. Because of the priority given to
the connection of new consumers, available funds were inadequate to also
provide for system improvements with the result that distribution losses
increased annually.
3.05      To reduce transmission and distribution losses will require large
investments in (i) higher voltage transmission lines to transfer large blocks
of power; (ii) conversion of existing 132 kV lines to 220 kV and 66 kV lines
to 132 kV; and (iii) additional substations - 132/66 kV; 132/11 kV; and 66/11
kV in order to reduce the length of existing 11 kV circuits thus increasing
their capability and reducing their losses. Improvement of power transport
capability can, however, be obtained now by the installation of capacitors
on the 11 kV circuits to improve the system power factor. WAPDA is already
in the process of installing about 450 MVAR of 11 kV capacitors which are
currently available, but a further 1,200 MVAR of capacitors will be needed
over the next five years to improve the system power factor to about 0.90.
WAPDA is also requesting the Government to make it mandatory for all motor
loads to be equipped with power factor correction equipment.



- 17 -
3.06      Theft and bad metering is another cause of losses which affect
WAPDA's financial operations. They were estimated at about 11.5% of energy
generated in 1976/77 equivalent to about Rps 275 million of lost revenue in
that year alone. Some of the theft is suspected to be in connivance with
WAPDA's own employees. WAPDA's management is aware of this problem and has
taken some steps to investigate and reduce such losses. Measures being taken
include (i) installation of meters on all 11 kV feeders in order to locate
high loss areas; (ii) upgrading of the quality of employees used for meter
reading; and (iii) making area managers responsible for high loss situations.
In addition, WAPDA is requesting the government to make certain changes in
the Electricity Act of 1910 to simplify the prosecution of theft cases.
3.07      Total losses have increased at a rate of about 11% p.a. during the
period 1970/71-1977/78 reaching a high of 37.6% of energy generated in 1976/77.
In this year about 400 MW of generating capacity was needed to compensate for
losses in excess of normal operations. Table 3.1 below gives the history over
the last few years of demand, generation, sales and losses on the WAPDA system.
A similar table (1.1) in Chapter 1 gives the same information for the combined
WAPDA-KESC systems.

3.08       It is not possible to determine the actual losses in each portion of
the system but a reasonable estimate can be made of the 1976/77 losses and the
expected improvements that could be achieved during the Fifth Plan period.
This is demonstrated in Table 3.2.

(Expressed as a percentage of generation)
3.09      Measures already taken by WAPDA during the last 12 months - espe-
cially in the area of theft and bad metering - have resulted in a reduction of
total losses from 37.6% in 1976/77 to 34.2 in 1978/79, reversing the historic
trend. A further reduction to 24% should be possible by 1982/83. Following
agreement reached during negotiations WAPDA has since established a team to
implement a program for the reduction of losses due to theft and inaccurate
metering to not more than 5% by June 30, 1982 and for the ultimate elimination
of such losses. WAPDA also agreed during negotiations to implement a program
satisfactory to the Association for the reduction of excessive tranmission and
distribution losses to a level of not more than 16% by 1983/84.

3.10      Table 3.3 demonstrates that the agricultural load accounts for just
under 24% of sales but for only about 14% of revenues.  There are no time
restrictions on the operation of pumps and the question could therefore
be raised whether measures designed to interrupt pumping loads between the
hours of 6 PM to 10 PM - WAPDA's system peak - could significantly reduce the
system peak and thus provide for better utilization of existing facilities.
These pumping loads total about 350 MW of which about 45% is public and about
55% private. The public load (about 150 MW) could be controlled without
difficulty and should be moved off-peak. With regard to the private pumping
load, (about 200 MW), WAPDA in the past has considered putting these on an
interruptible basis but refrained from doing so because (i) there are no
separate feeders for pumping loads, and villages and some town areas fed
by such feeders would be affected; and (ii) time-switch meters were not con-
sidered a viable alternative because of possible interference with them and
because power outages would affect their operation. The question of restrict-
ing the use of irrigation pumps during the peak period was discussed during
negotiations and the Pakistan delegation agreed that a study would be made
of different methods of achieving this, including the installation of "ripple
control." In the meantime, the delegation agreed that the possibility of
separating the connection of villages from the public pumping systems would
be examined so that the pumping loads could be disconnected during peak
periods without inconveniencing other consumers. Progress in these matters
will be monitored during future project supervision missions.

Iariffs
3.11      The last detailed study of tariffs was carried out during 1967-1969
and new tariffs were introduced in July l969. Since that date, increases have
been granted on a percentage basis but usually either residential or agricul-
tural customers, or both, have been exempted from an increase for political
reasons. The history of the average sale price per kWh during the last few
years is shown in Table 3.4 below:
Table 3.4
Average Sale Price of Electricity
Average Sale Price
Year        paisa per kWh    U.S. cents.kWh        Percent Increase
1972/73         13.96               1.41                  3.1

1978/79         35.02               3.53                 19.8
3.12      The above table reflects tariff increases which, while significant,
were insufficient to facilitate gradual and deliberate progress toward the
target of achieving a 30% self-financing level by FY80 required under Loan
1208T-PAK. A more satisfactory trend would have required an average revenue
of 39.86 paisa/kWh in 1976/77 instead of 27.64 paisa. As discussed in
Chapter V, a further tariff increase of about 50% above the current level
would have been required in 1979/80 to meet WAPDA's self-financing target.
3.13      The past practice of exempting residential and agricultural consumers
from tariff increases has distorted tariffs between classes of consumers. In
particular, residential and agricultural consumers with relatively high costs
to serve are being subsidized at the expense of commercial and industrial
consumers. Following discussions and agreements reached during negotiations,
WAPDA has since established a unit to carry out tariff analyses. These
analyses would be based on the results of the energy pricing and load forecast
study discussed in Annex 1 and paragraph 1.25, and would determine the cost of
supply to individual consumer categories. Such analyses would also determine
the necessary restructuring of tariffs to better reflect the objectives of a
rational energy policy, and provide consumers with incentives to shift demand
to off-peak periods. To establish a bench mark of the cost to the economy of
providing electricity services, the average long range marginal cost of
supply should also be determined. In connection with a Bank-sponsored seminar
on public utility tariffs, the Bank assisted WAPDA in developing terms of
reference for carrying out such a tariff study.  It was also agreed during



- 21 -
negotiations that WAPDA would (i) complete the tariff study by December 31,
1979; (ii) obtain the views of GOP and the Association on the recommendations
arising from the study; and (iii) implement, beginning July 1, 1980, the
recommendations of the study in accordance with a program satisfactory to
GOP, WAPDA and the Association.
Load Forecasting Within WAPDA
3.14      Load forecasting within WAPDA is the responsibility of the Power
Market Survey Division. A survey of prospective consumers is made and
relevant data from the public and private sectors on proposed agricultural
and industrial development are reviewed.  A forecast on this basis, without
correlation to historic and forecast economic development may result in higher
demand forecasts than are reasonable. The forecast in this report assumes
an annual growth rate of sales, in the short term, of about 13.5%. Allowing
for a reduction in system losses, the annual growth of generation would be
about 9%. These growth rates are based on extrapolations of historic trends,
excluding the years 1975/76 and 1976/77 which were affected by economic stag-
nation and political unrest. The revised load forecast, which is to be made
(see para 1.25), will take into account the results of the energy pricing and
tariff studies to reduce the uncertainties presently underlying the present
forecast. This will then enable the generation investment program of plants
scheduled for commissioning during the Sixth Plan period to be firmed up,
indicating necessary investments during the Fifth Plan. Table 3.5 summarizes
the expected growth of WAPDA's system. (Growth for the combined WAPDA and
KESC systems is shown in Table 1.2.)

3.15      The question could be asked whether the assumption of a 13.5% annual
growth of sales is realistic in view of a historic growth rate of 8% on aver-
age for the period 1970/71-1977/78. Given that the years 1975/76 and 1976/77
were periods of industrial stagnation and political difficulties, the supply



- 22 -
situation was compounded by WAPDA's financial and technical constraints. The
technical constraints were to a large degree overcome by the recent commis-
sioning of the first four Tarbela units and the financial constraints will be
reduced by the proposed project, designed not only to rehabilitate the exist-
ing secondary transmission system, but also to expand this system to new areas
to meet potential demand. The growth rate of 19% experienced in 1977/78 is an
indication of this latent demand and is an indication that, if anything, the
assumption of a 13.5% annual growth of sales, in the short term (1978/79
through 1982/83), is likely to prove conservative.
Investment Program
Generation
3.16      Financing of generating facilities scheduled for commissioning
during the Fifth Plan is essentially assured. Table 3.6 summarizes the
facilities, the year of commissioning and the sources of finance:

/b   Size of units to be increased; consultant has been appointed to
study the matter and put up recommendations.
These generation additions will increase WAPDA's capacity from 2,685 MW to
3,950 MW by 1982/83 and the low water capability from 1,945 MW to 2,782 MW
(including reserves). With a firm interconnection of the WAPDA and KESC
systems, these additions would be sufficient to meet the estimated demand.
3.17      Because of the substantial variation of hydro output between the
high water and the low water months due to head conditions, (Mangla: Unit
capability 100-50 MW; Tarbela: Unit capability 175-57 MW; and Warsak: Sta-
tion capability 240-80 MW), WAPDA's generation development strategy is the
installation of a hydro-thermal mix of generation facilities to take this



- 23 -
into consideration. During the high water months hydro capability would be
fully utilized, and thermal generation would be reduced thus saving fuel and
allowing maintenance to be carried out. During the low water months hydro
plants would operate on base and thermal plants would be utilized essentially
to cover intermediate and peak demand. Excepting Tarbela which will be com-
pleted in 1985, there are presently no hydro plants that have reached a stage
of investigation which would permit them to be built and commissioned in the
Sixth Plan. For the longer term, WAPDA has allocated about US$6 million
equivalent in the current plan period for a ranking study and planning and
investigation of major potential hydro projects, and a sum of about US$13
million for a feasibility study of the Kalabagh hydro project (1,750 MW).
In the interim period generating facilities scheduled for commissioning during
the Sixth Plan, whose construction will commence during the Fifth Plan, are
all thermal - the principal ones being Lakhra (coal-fired), for which a pre-
liminary feasibility study has already been made, and an oil or gas fired
plant located near one or the other oil or gas fields in the central region.
The Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission also plans to construct a 600 MW nuclear
plant at Chashma. These proposals would be subject to reconsideration when
the load forecast and other studies are completed (see para 1.25).
Primary and Secondary Transmission and Substations
3.18      One 500 kV line from Tarbela to Faisalabad is currently in opera-
tion. A 500 kV line from Faisalabad to Guddu is under construction and will
be extended to the Hyderabad/Karachi area. The commissioning of this line
is as follows:
Section Multan - Guddu               1980/81
Section Multan - Faisalabad          1980/81
Section Guddu  - Hyderabad           1982/83
Section Hyderabad/Karachi            1982/83
Initially these sections will be operated at 220 kV and will be converted to
500 kV operation with the completion of the Tarbela plant by early calendar
year 1985. With the existing 220 kV lines from Tarbela to Mangla, Lahore,
Faisalabad and Multan, these 500 kV lines will more effectively interconnect
the major power plants with the load centers. Provision has been included
in the Project for consultants to carry out a study of the problems arising
from the 220 kV to 500 kV conversion program. Additional 220 kV transmission
lines and substations will be required to remove bottlenecks to, and in, the
basic 132 kV systems. These lines are: Guddu-Dadu (single circuit) to meet
the increasing demand on the right bank of the Indus at Kandhkot, Shikarpur,
Larkana, Radhan and Dadu presently served by a double circuit 132 kV system
on the left bank of the Indus; Tarbela-Mardan (double circuit) bypassing the
Burhan bottleneck to meet the increasing demand in the Peshawar area;
Faisalabad-Sahiwal (double circuit) to supply the 132 kV system on the left
bank of the Ravi river serving the area between the Ravi and Sutlej rivers
presently mainly supplied from Multan and Lahore; the Ghakar substation pro-
viding a 220/132 kV connection to the Mangla-Lahore 220 kV transmission line;
and the 220 kV line (single circuit) Guddu-Sibi serving the Quetta area and
presently operated at 132 kV. These 220 kV lines would relieve presently
overloaded 132 kV circuits and improve voltage conditions.



- 24 -
3.19      At the 132 kV and 66 kV transmission and substation level a load
flow study by WAPDA has shown that to meet the load growth, to improve the
service to existing consumers, and to reduce losses, an extensive rehabilita-
tion and expansion program is essential. A scheduled program for the five
year period 1978/79-1982/83, is shown in Annex 5.
Distribution
3.20      In the past, targets established for distribution were constrained
by shortages in available funds. The Fifth Plan has set the following
priorities: (i) industrial and agricultural connections; and (ii) rural
electrification.  The yearly targets are:
New connections
General consumers                140,000
Industrial consumers              11,000
Agricultural consumers            14,000
Village electrification                  1,000
11 kV lines (excluding RE)               1,000 miles
400 V lines (excluding RE)               1,000 miles
3.21      A more planned approach will be taken for rural electrification than
in the past, utilizing economic criteria rather than electrifying villages
that lie within a certain range of a transmission line or substation. From
the overall allocation of about Rs 5,300 million for distribution, about one
third will be utilized for rural electrification, i.e., about Rs 1,700 million
or about US$170 million (US$35 million per annum). This is not unreasonable,
amounting to about 6% of total investments.
Operational Strategy
3.22      WAPDA's power dispatching operations can be substantially improved.
With WAPDA's expanding size and the introduction of 500 kV lines, it will be
imperative to modernize existing dispatching capability. A study covering a
load dispatch control system designed for economic load dispatch, load flows,
stability and short circuit analysis in order to achieve optimum operations
will be financed by ADB under the Project. The study, which will examine the
combined WAPDA/KESC systems, will also consider an improved and compatible
telemetry and telecommunication system between generating plants, substations
and load dispatch center.
System Expansion Costs
3.23      The system expansion program assumed in this report for the Fifth
Plan 1978/79-1982/83 is given in detail in Annex 6 and will require a total
expenditure (including escalation and interest during construction) of around
US$2,700 million including a foreign exchange cost component of about US$900
million. The investments are summarized in Table 3.7.

3.24      The balance between generation, transmission and distribution,
as indicated above, has been greatly improved. The average investment per
incremental kW of demand is about US$1,000 (including escalation and interest
during construction) and corresponds to an historic cost of about US$660
(1977/78). This is not unreasonable, especially given the system character-
istics and the rehabilitation work to be carried out.

IV. THE PROJECT
Project Description
4.01      The proposed project covers the last four years of WAPDA's
Secondary Transmission Program 1978/79 - 1982/83 subdivided into the follow-
ing components:
(a)  Transmission lines:  erection of about 2,700 miles of
220 kV, 132 kV and 66 kV single and double circuit lines
with estimated total costs of US$238 million of which
US$20 million would be in foreign exchange;
(b)  Substations:  construction, expansion and conversion of
216 substations of 220/132 kV and 132/66/11 kV with an
aggregate capacity of about 4,800 MVA at an estimated
total cost of US$268 million of which just over US$111
million would be in foreign exchange;
(c)  Construction of storage facilities for the project materials
and equipment; and
(d)  Consulting services for (1) a load dispatch system study
and (2) a study of the problems arising from the 220 kV to
500 kV conversion program.
The Project is described in detail in Annex 7.
4.02      To determine the quantities of materials and equipment required,
WAPDA prepared detailed schedules of equipment requirements for each line
and for each substation which have been specifically identified. Neverthe-
less, reasonable allowances should be allowed for variations in locations
and equipment requirements during the execution of the project to take into
account changes in forecast loads.
4.03      The proposed Project has taken into account co-financing f-cm various
sources (see para 4.06), thus permitting the identification of a cumsprehencive
secondary transmission project which should make a substantial contributio. to
improving the efficiency of WAPDA's power system. In addition, the approach
taken greatly reduces the ad hoc, piecemeal manner which has characterized
past transmission system development, would help to coordinate the financing
of the several foreign donors interested, and would permit donors to have a
coordinated approach to the critical institutional and other issues in the
sector and, in particular, permit the basic problem facing WAPDA of high
power losses to be addressed more effectively.
Estimated Costs
4.04      The estimated costs of the principal features of the Project are
shown in Table 4.1 below and in more detail, together with the parts of the
Project to be financed from the different sources in Annexes 8 and 9.

4.05       Prices were determined from similar work being completed in 1976/77
and subsequent years, appropriately escalated to give base 1979 prices. A
physical contingency of 5% has been included to allow for variations in the
scope of work and a price contingency of 11% per annum for local costs and 8%
per annum for foreign costs has been allowed through the construction period.
This has resulted in an overall price increase of 30% on local costs and just
under 12% on foreign costs. The latter figure is comparatively low because
(a) fixed price equipment contracts are anticipated and some 80% of the foreign
expenditures will be incurred during the first two years.



28 --
4.06      To finance the foreign exchange costs of the proposed Project, the
following sources of finance are expected to be available:
(i)  CIDA (tied)                US$14.5 million (1981/82 & 1982/83 trans-
mission lines)
(ii)  KfW, Germany (untied)    US$18 million equivalent (equipment for
30 specified 132/66 kV grid substations)
(iii)  ADFB (untied)              US$25 million (220 kV gridstations, capa-
citors and telecommunication equipment)
(US$24 million)
(iv)  EEC Special Action         US$29 million equivalent (equipment for
Account (Tied) 1/          132/66 kV gridstations)
(v)  IDA Proposed Credit         US$45 million (yard structures, equipment
(untied)              for 132/66 kV gridstations, 1979/80 and
1980/81 transmission lines and construction
equipment)(US$44.2 million)
Total                 US$131.5 million
4.07      The above aggregate amounts would finance the foreign exchange cost
of equipment estimated at US$129.7 million plus the cost of a load dispatch
control study estimated at US$1.0 million to be financed by ADB and a study
to examine the problems of the 220 kV to 500 kV conversion program estimated
at US$0.8 million to be financed by IDA. The EEC credit of US$35 million
equivalent would also finance around US$6 million of local costs which would
comprise, principally, gridstation foundations, control rooms and warehouse
facilities for storage of project materials and equipment.
Engineering and Construction
4.08      Engineering, preparation of specifications and bidding documents
and supervision of construction will be carried out by WAPDA's own staff,
although some assistance will be required with engineering and design of the
220 kV system. WAPDA will engage the services of a consultant, satisfactory
to the Association, for this purpose. With the experience gained from Credit
213-PAK, Loan 1208T-PAK and other similar work, this arrangement is satisfac-
tory. Construction will normally be accomplished by local contractors but in
some cases will be done by WAPDA's own work forces.
4.09      The Project is part of a complex program comprising a large number
of works which must be carefully coordinated to ensure phased commissioning
of each complementary aspect as required. To ensure that this is handled
1/   The Special Action Account is tied procurement of goods or services
supplied from (i) any of the Member States and (ii) any developing
country which is a member of the Association and could be a recipient
of a special action credit.



- 29 -
efficiently, it would be necessary to establish a project management team,
the first task of which would be to prepare a system for project management
and control through the design, procurement and construction stages. This
was discussed during negotiations and WAPDA agreed to establish such a team
and prepare procedures satisfactory to the Association setting out the frame-
work for project management. WAPDA also agreed that, if necessary, consult-
ants would be engaged to assist in establishing its management and control
procedures.
4.10      WAPDA has since established its project management team and, with
the assistance of the Association, has prepared a manual setting out its
project management procedures. This has been the subject of detailed discus-
sion between WAPDA and an appraisal updating mission subsequent to negotia-
tions. The steps taken by WAPDA are satisfactory to IDA. Future missions
to supervise the progress of construction of the Project should ensure con-
tinuing compliance with the agreed procedures. A project implementation
schedule is shown in Annex 10.
Procurement and Disbursement
4.11      With regard to the IDA credit all contracts for materials (with the
exception of local materials required for civil works) and equipment required
for substations and transmissions lines to be financed from the proceeds of the
proposed credit will be subject to international competitive bidding in accord-
ance with the Association's Guidelines. Documents for individual contracts
above US$250,000 equivalent would be subject to prior review by the Association.
Some Pakistani participation is envisaged, particularly steel for transmission
towers and switchyard structures, conductors, insulators and hardware. In
these cases a domestic preference of 15%, or the prevailing import duties, if
lower, would be applied to bid comparison. Contracts for materials and equip-
ment of less than US$50,000 equivalent up to an aggregate of US$500,000 would
not be subject to ICB, and would be procured in accordance with the borrower's
procedures which are satisfactory. Disbursements from the proposed credit
would cover:
100% of the foreign exchange cost of imported material
and equipment or 100% of the ex-factory price of locally
manufactured material and equipment procured through inter-
national competitive bidding, and 100% of the cost of
consultants.
4.12      Contracts for materials and equipment to be financed from the Spe-
cial Action Account which is established with funds contributed by member
states of the European Economic Community, and which is administered by the
Association are treated in a similar fashion to that described in paragraph
4.11 above except that ICB is confined to the member states and any develop-
ing country which is a member of the Association and could be the recipient
of a special action credit. In addition to equipment and materials, civil
works and other local expenditures up to about US$6 million equivalent would
be financed from the Special Action Account. Contracts below US$200,000
equivalent and aggregating not more than US$6 million equivalent would be
procured in accordance with the borrower's procedures. In any case, such



- 30 -
expenditures, which would mainly comprise small civil works for the more than
200 scattered substations and associated control rooms and storage facilities,
are not expected to be of interest to foreign contractors. Disbursements from
the proposed EEC Credit would cover:
100% of foreign expenditures and 95% of local expendi-
tures for civil works and erection of equipment; or 100%
of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment
and materials, including construction equipment; or 1.00%
of local expenditures (ex-factory) for locaMly manufactured
equipment/materials procured through ICB; or 70% of local
expenditures for equipment/materials procured locally
other than through ICB.

Completion Report
4.14      During negotiations, WAPDA agreed, by not later than December 31,
1983, or such later date as may be agreed between WAPDA and the Association,
to prepare and submit to the Association and the co-financing agencies a
Completion Report, of such scope and detail as reasonably requested on the
execution of the Project, its initial operations, its costs and benefits, an
analysis of achieved reduction in losses with a comparison to targets estab-
lished, the performance by the Beneficiary and the Association of their
respective obligations and the accomplishment of the purposes of the Credit.

V. FINANCES
Background
5.01      The basic information on which this section is based is derived from
the Power Wing's accounts, which are kept independently from those of the Water
Wing. However, the lack of proper accounts has hampered the availability of
full and timely data.  This has required that financial projections be based
on assumptions regarding recent and current accounts. These have been agreed
with WAPDA. While these assumptions are reasonable and provide a basis for
assessing future trends, they will need to be reviewed periodically in the
course of executing the program.
Tariffs - Earnings Covenant
5.02      The WAPDA Act authorizes the Authority to set its own charges for
electricity, but in practice the Authority must obtain the Government's
approval before new rates become effective. Present tariffs are set out
in Annex 11 and discussed in para 3.11.
5.03      The Act stipulates that:
"The rates at which the Authority shall sell power shall be
so fixed as to provide for meeting the operating costs, in-
terest charges and depreciation of assets, the redemption at
due time of loans other than those covered by depreciation,
the payment of any taxes and a reasonable return on invest-
ment."
The Government has never specified what constitutes a "reasonable" return.
The earnings covenant under Credit 213-PAK (the first Bank Group lending
operation to WAPDA in 1970) called for revenues to be sufficient to earn an
annual rate of return of at least 8% on average revalued net fixed assets
in service. However, WAPDA has only partially revalued its assets (para 5.04)
and it appears that revaluation would increase the stated value by about 80%
as of the end of FY78. A combination of low tariffs, high system losses and
lower sales and revenues because of inability to meet demand has prevented the
meeting of the earnings covenant.
5.04      At the time of appraisal for Loan 1208T-PAK in 1975, WAPDA's poor
financial situation was demonstrably deteriorating still further. The rate
of return covenant was not being met and was proving to be impracticable.
The Government strongly objected to revaluing WAPDA's assets (though the
foreign exchange component was revalued to the extent of the devaluation of
the Pakistan rupee in 1972 for outstanding foreign borrowings); hence, WAPDA's
assets continued to be recorded at historical cost, thus precluding a real-
istic rate base on which to calculate a rate of return. At the same time
WAPDA's financial requirements to finance a reasonable portion of its expansion
program called for unacceptably high rates of return on historically valued
assets. Also the magnitude of a rate increase required to immediately reach
an acceptable level of self-generated funds appeared unattainable in light of
Government's reluctance or inability to grant sufficient rate increases.



_. 3?"? -
5.05      The reassessment of the situation at the time of the 1975 apprai-
sal had the aim of retaining the financial objectives of improving WAPDA's
financial position while seeking an acceptable solution for assisti-ng WAPDA
in attaining those objectives. Recognizing that a satisfactory level of self-
generated funds could only be achieved over a period of time, and that WAPDA
was in need of capital contributions free of dividend, interest and repay-
ment obligation, the following cash generation covenant was agreed for Loan
1208T-PAK, replacing the rate of return covenant under Credit 213-PAK:
(a) tariffs to be increased in steps during the period
FY77-FY80 to permit bv no Inter than th^ end of FV80
the financing of 30% of power investments through net
internal cash generation in every consecutive three-
year period. The performance test was to be made on
the ba3is of historical three-year periods for the
first time in FY80 for the three fiscal years 1978-
1980 and annually thereafter for the respective past
three fiscal years;
(b) the first tariff increase was to be at least 20%,
effective not later than March 31, 1977; and
(c) to improve WAPDA's capital structure, the Government
in each year until FY80 was to make dividend and interest
free capital contributions equivalent to the shortfall
between the actual net internal cash generation and the
targeted 30% of annual power investments.
5.06      There has been compliance in respect of item (b) above.  Another
tariff increase and a new fuel adjustment surcharge 1/, together raising
charges by an estimated 24%, became effective July 1, 1978. However,
domestic and tubewell consumers, which account for some 40% of sales, were
partially exempt. In addition to prejudicing WAPDA's earnings, which were
already inadequate, this has created further distortions in the tariff struc-
ture. It is undesirable that these consumers should be largely exempt from
rate increases at the expense of an ever-increasing cross-subsidy from other
customers. With a view to rationalizing the tariff structure, a tariff study
is being undertaken (para 3.13).
5.07      Government has also complied with item (c).  Based on the agreed
tariff increases (para 5.09), forecasts show that capital contributions
may be required in FY80 and that in FY81 WAPDA would reach a level of internal
cash generation sufficient to finance at least 30% of annual power investments.
1/   The new fuel clause reads:  A fuel adjustment surcharge will be added
to each kilowatt hour sold during the billing month, such surcharge is
to be equal to the total cost of fuel consumed by WAPDA during the
twelve months preceding the previous two months divided by the kilowatt
hours sales of all customers during the said period expressed to the
nearest paisa.



- 33 -
5.08      Financial forecasts showed that in order for WAPDA to meet the earn-
ings covenant under Loan 1208T-PAK by self-financing 30% of its power invest-
ments during the preceding three years, a tariff increase of 50% would have
been required to be effective July 1, 1979. This was more of an increase at
that time than would have been necessary had Government allowed phased tariff
increases in the time frame agreed in the earnings covenant. However, a
tendency has been for Government to believe that since the test period was not
until 1980, increases could be deferred -- even though it was appreciated that
early and sufficient adjustments would facilitate compliance with the tariff
covenant.
5.09      During negotiations the Pakistan delegation stated that a 50% tariff
increase by July 1, 1979, would be unrealistic and unacceptable in the current
circumstances in Pakistan, because, inter alia, an increase in the ration shop
price of wheat of 40% had recently been announced and other price increases
which will have a direct impact on the general public were included in the new
budget. Tariff increases as finally agreed are: 25% effective July 1, 1979
(this increase was made effective on the agreed date), and two additional
increases, each of at least 10% by not later than July 1, 1980 and July 1,
1981. Forecasts show that these increases would enable WAPDA to meet the
present 30% self-financing requirement by FY81, one year later than provided
under the Loan Agreement for the Second Power Project. Also, the proportion
of WAPDA's capital expenditure financed from its own internal sources is shown
to increase to the 40% level beginning with FY83, a level which it is proposed
that WAPDA should maintain. During negotiations it was agreed that WAPDA
would annually, by March 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 1980, complete,
and furnish to the Association, a review of the adequacy of its electricity
tariff, and make necessary adjustments thereto to enable WAPDA, beginning with
FY83, to provide at least 40% of its power investments through net internal
cash generation in every consecutive three-year period (See Annex 12 for
calculation). It was further agreed that until FY83, the Government would,
by September 30 of 1980, 1981, and 1982, provide to WAPDA such funds which are
required by WAPDA to enable it to finance not less than 30% of its capital
expenditures for electricity operations during the preceding fiscal year,
the said funds to be made available free of interest and without obligation
of repayment.
5.10      The present form of earnings covenant is well suited to WAPDA's
situation at this time because (i) it addresses directly the need for financ-
ing a heavy investment program by judging the adequacy of WAPDA's tariff level
against the power development requirements, and (ii) avoids controversies with
the Government over the question of asset revaluation which is a prerequisite
for a meaningful rate of return. Nevertheless, it would be desirable for
WAPDA to be able to calculate a rate of return for comparison purposes.
During negotiations, it was recorded in the Agreed Minutes of Negotiations
that IDA supports the Asian Development Bank's proposal that the Power Wing
make a physical verification of its fixed assets and value these assets on a
current basis. This action, together with fixed asset accounting being
introduced as part of the new system (para 5.16) would enable WAPDA to cal-
culate a meaningful rate of return.
5.11      Forecasts show that in reaching the targeted level of earnings, the
average revenue per kWh sold would increase from the present 35.02 paisa



- 34 -
(USg 3.5) to 53.88 paisa (USN 5.4) in FY82. The charge per kWh of USU 5.4
equivalent is considered reasonable for Pakistan. Forecasts take into account
an improvement in system losses.
Past Operations
5.12       Income statements for FY76 - FY78 are shown in Annex 13.  The follow-
ing table gives a summary of the operating results:
Year ending June 30                                 1976    1977    1978
kWh generated (millions)                                8,268    8,734  10,091

Operating revenues                                      1,312    1,611   1,991
Operating expenses                                      1,025    1,169   1,205
Operating income                                          287       442      786
Net (income/loss) after interest and
payment to Government                                   (33)       28      297
Net internal cash generation after debt service          (145)      (79)    255
Rate of return on historically valued assets                4.0%      5.5%    8.6%
Rate of return on revalued assets (estimated)              (0.3%)    0.7%    2.5%
Net internal cash generation as a percentage
of capital investment                                    (7.8%)   (4.0%)   8.1%
5.13      While the foregoing figures show that operating results are improving,
they have not been satisfactory. Tariff increases have helped, but the addi-
tional revenues have been insufficient. In two of the past three years, WAPDA
has either incurred a net loss or barely broken even, and debt service has
exceeded internal cash generation. In addition to generally low tariffs, two
significant factors bearing on this situation are the large amount of system
losses (discussed in Chapter III), as shown by the percentage of kWh sold to
kWh generated, and the lower revenues as a result of the exemption from tariff
increases of domestic and agricultural tubewell consumers, which account for
about 40% of sales.
5.14      Other factors that have contributed to the unsatisfactory operat-
ing results are: (i) Government's undertaking of projects with low financial
returns, such as rural and tubewell electrification; (ii) price level rises
and (iii) a general lack of control of expenses. The latter is a major
weakness and should be helped by the accounting system and procedures to be
implemented under the guidance of consultants (para 2.15). It will enable
WAPDA to focus on better cost control, on more clearly stated operational
objectives and on a more commercially oriented operation.

Present Financial Position
5.15      Balance sheets for FY76-FY78 are shown in Annex 14.  The present
book value of fixed assets is shown at historical cost, which is a requirement
for Government agencies (para 5.04). A high proportion of the assets has been
commissioned in the last few years, the amount of gross fixed assets having
almost doubled within the last four years. Almost all plant additions have
been from the expansion programs except assets valued at PRs 1,972 million
transferred to WAPDA by Government.  The value of these transfers was equiva-
lent to 16% of the value of fixed assets in operation at June 30, 1978.
5.16      The new system of accounting will include fixed asset accounting
and will provide for the classification of fixed assets which will be the
basis for calculating depreciation. In the meantime, WAPDA has been applying
a composite rate for depreciation of 3-1/2% which is realistic and which is
used in the forecasts.
5.17      The capitalization as of June 30, 1978 is summarized as follows:
US$ Million
PRs Million       Equivalent    %
Equity
Government investment               1,972             199        14
Government equity contributions   1,287               130         9
Retained earnings                     825              84         6
Total Equity                    4,084             413         29
Long-term Debt                       10,119           1,022        71
Total Capital                  14,203           1,435        100
The foregoing figures reflect the capitalization of WAPDA on the basis of
assets being recorded at historical cost; therefore, with the assets under-
valued, the debt/equity ratio is overstated. If assets were revalued (para
5.03), it is probable that the debt/equity ratio would be about 50/50.
Financing Plan
5.18      A forecast of sources and applications of funds for the five-year
period FY80 - FY84 is shown in Annex 15. The assumptions used are shown in
Annex 16 and include upward tariff adjustments and execution of the construc-
tion program as planned. Following is a summary of the financing plan for
the WAPDA Power Wing as a whole during the four years FY80 - FY83, during
which the proposed project will be implemented.

5.19      The financing plan shows the Government providing funds to WAPDA
amounting to PRs 5,643 million (loan and equity) over the four-year period.
However, there would, in fact, be a net flow of funds from WAPDA to Government
by virtue of WAPDA's operations. When taking into account those funds accru-
ing to Government in respect of customs duties, sales tax and debt service,
the net flow from WAPDA to Government during the four-year period is shown
to be of the order of PRs 4,000 million.
5.20      The amounts of funds shown in the financing plan are large in both
relative and absolute terms, and illustrate the characteristic capital inten-
siveness of power infrastructure. During this four-year period, fund require-
ments are expected to total PRs 22,244 million (US$2,247 million equivalent,
including a foreign exchange requirement of US$784 million), consisting of an
estimated capital investment of PRs 21,852 million (US$2,207 million equiva-
lent), and an increase in working capital of PRs 392 million (US$40 million
equivalent).



- 37 -
5.21      Included as sources of funds are borrowings amounting to PRs 13,431
million (US$1,357 million equivalent), of which PRs 5,611 million are local
funds to be lent by Government and which form part of WAPDA's Government-
approved capital program. An additional PRs 59 million will be provided under
the proposed EEC Credit. Of the remaining PRs 7,761 million (US$784 million
equivalent) in foreign exchange, US$377 million has already been arranged or
is in the process of being arranged, leaving US$407 million yet to be obtained.
The capital program, which is designed to meet the country's power require-
ments, was agreed with the mission, WAPDA and GOP's Planning Commission and
represents a scaled down version of the one originally put forward by WAPDA.
The project is designed to utilize additional generation for which foreign
exchange is already provided and which is in the process of being built, and
would not be affected were there delays in that part of the program for which
foreign exchange is still not yet arranged.
5.22      The proposed project, estimated to cost PRs 5,010 million (US$506
million equivalent, including a foreign exchange component of US$132 million),
represents 23% of the total capital program during this period. The IDA and
EEC Credits would provide US$74 million of the project's foreign exchange
component, equivalent to about 56% of the project's foreign costs. The
balance of the foreign exchange requirement is expected to be met from
co-financing sources: the Asian Development Bank (ADB), US$25 million;
Germany, Kreditandstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW), US$18 million; and Canada,
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), US$14.5 million (para
4.06).
5.23      The on-lending terms from GOP to WAPDA for the proposed IDA and EEC
credits would be at 8.75% for 25 years, including a five-year grace period -
Government's present terms for on-lending foreign funds to Government-owned
revenue earning agencies. The terms for Government rupee loans are at 11.75%
for 25 years, including five years of grace 1/. The Government would bear
the foreign exchange risk.
5.24      Also included as a source of funds are government equity contribu-
tions estimated at PRs 32 million to be provided to WAPDA as stipulated in
the earnings covenant under Loan 1208T-PAK (Annex 12).
5.25      The foregoing financing plan shows WAPDA providing 40% of its
requirements from internal cash generation, after debt service; borrowings
would amount to 60%, of which only 4% would be the sum of the proposed IDA and
EEC Credits (3%) and the unwithdrawn amount of Loan 1208T-PAK (1%). Consider-
ing the heavy investment program, the self-financing of 40% of the next four
1/   During the three-year period 1975/76 - 1977/78, the average annual in-
crease in the Wholesale Price Index in Pakistan was 8.6%. However,
recent trends indicate a rising level of inflation. The projections
in this report use an inflation rate of 11% p.a. for local costs and
8% p.a. for foreign costs which are considered realistic. The current
interest rate for government loans for working capital and investment
purposes is between eleven and twelve percent.

years' capital requirements is satisfactory. The financing plan provides
that WAPDA will meet the earnings covenant and improve its financial position
through tariff increases while maintaining rates at a reasonable level (para
5.11).
Future Finances
5.26      Forecast income statements, balance sheets and sources and appli-
cations of funds statements for FY's 79-84 are shown in Annexes 13, 14 and 15,
respectively; notes and assumptions are shown in Annex 16. A summary of fore-
cast operating results for the six-year period is as follows:

Debt/equity ratio (historically          61/39  63/37  63/37  62/38  61/39  61/39
valued assets)
5.27      Revenue projections are based on increases in generation of elec-
tricity, tariff increases and a gradual reduction in system losses. Operating
expenses, including fuel costs are forecast based on system expansion and
planned thermal generation. Depreciation is taken at a 3-1/2% composite rate,
which is realistic (para 5.16). These six-year forecasts show operating
revenues and expenses increasing at an average annual rate of about 26% and
22%, respectively. On the basis of the forecasts, WAPDA will have reached in
FY81 a level of earnings permitting it to finance 34% of the average previous
three years' (including FY81) power investments from average net internal cash
generation for the same three years, and beginning with FY83 to finance in the
40% range of power investments on the same basis. This will satisfy the new
earnings covenant. The rate of return that would be earned on roughly revalued
fixed assets during this period would range between about 5% and 12%. This
assumes an 80% undervaluation of assets at the end of FY78.
5.28      Forecast balance sheets (Annex 14) show WAPDA's financial position
at the end of each year, FY79 through FY84. The balance sheets reflect the
substantial expansion expected in gross fixed assets in operation - from
PRs 12,290 million at June 30, 1978 to PRs 41,117 million at June 30, 1984.
In financing this expansion, long-term debt is expected to increase by
PRs 15,238 million (1.5 times) and equity by PRs 12,133 million (3 times),
resulting in the strengthening of the capital structure: the debt/equity
ratio is shown to improve from 71/29 in FY78 to 61/39 in FY84 mainly as a
result of increased retained earnings. The coverage of debt service by
internal cash generation would be satisfactory, ranging between 1.6 and 2.3
times.

VI. JUSTIFICATION
6.01      The transmission lines and substations provided by the Project are
required to meet the growing demand to enable power available from new or
expanded generating stations to reach the load centers. One of the main
benefits of the project will, however, be a reduction of system losses and
an improvement of the power factor thus enabling existing generating plant
and facilities to meet a higher demand. These improvements alone will release
about 550 MW of capacity, thus saving at least US$300 million equivalent or
nearly 60% of the proposed project investments. A further benefit will be
a reduction of the loading and length of existing 11 kV distribution circuits.
6.02      The Project forms a part of an overall plan to expand and improve
generation, transmission and distribution facilities. Nearly all generation
facilities for the fifth plan period are under construction and are being
financed by other agencies. The financing and construction of major trans-
mission and the 500 kV transmission linking Tarbela to the Hyderabad/Karachi
area are well under way. USAID, and CIDA both have plans to assist with
sizeable credits for distribution and rural electrification materials. Thus,
with generation, EHV transmission and, to a large part, distribution and rural
electrification taken care of, the Project (secondary transmission) constitutes
an integral and critical part of the expansion program and must be completed
to achieve the objectives.
6.03      Because the Project comprises a part of WAPDA's complex development
program, it is not possible to separate in a meaningful manner that portion
of incremental revenues that could be attributable to it and therefore an
internal economic rate of return (IERR) on the project cannot be computed.
However, it is possible to calculate an IERR based on a time slice (1978/79
to 1982/83) of WAPDA's investment program. A comparison of capital, fuel and
operating and maintenance costs with the incremental revenues valued at the
average tariff level, attributable to this 5 year investment program, yields
an IERR of about 11% which is near the opportunity cost of capital (see Annex
17, for details). This indicates that average tariffs are close to the mean
incremental cost of supply, based on the five-year investment program.
Project Risks
6.04         The project, comprising the last four years of the Secondary
Transmission Program, is part of WAPDA's overall development program and
the principal risk area is the possibility of slippage with consequent cost
overruns and loss of revenues. This risk will be reduced considerably with
the establishment of a management team to supervise the progress through all
stages to completion.
6.05         Providing the project can be kept on schedule there should be
little risk of significant cost overruns as equipment costs are based on
similar works currently in progress in Pakistan and adequate provision has
been made for cost escalation.

The Energy Sector
1.        Pakistan's domestic energy resources are characterized by sizeable
reserves of natural gas, substantial hydro, but only limited known reserves
of crude oil and exploitable coal, and no uranium. Thus, while hydro and
natural gas have been developed extensively and now account for one half of
total energy requirements, indigenous coal and crude oil supply a much smaller
proportion of the requirements. As in most countries in South Asia, a large
part of internal energy requirements (50%) are still met by non-commercial
energy sources such as firewood, animal dung, bagasse and maize roots, which
constitute the bulk of energy supplies in rural areas.
Natural Gas
2.        First discovered in the mid-fifties, natural gas has been an import-
ant component of Pakistan's primary energy resources. Total proven "recover-
able" reserves are estimated at 9.0 trillion cubic feet (225 million tons of
oil equivalent) of which about 18.50% has been used. Recent discoveries, still
to be fully evaluated could raise reserves to about 17 trillion cubic feet
which would meet foreseeable internal demand until at least the year 2000.
Coal
3.        Extensive coal deposits have been identified but the quality is
generally poor, having a high ash and sulphur content and a low heating value.
The largest known coal field is at Lakhra, producing coal of a quality for
mine-head power generation. Proven recoverable reserves are currently esti-
mated at between 150-170 million tons (65-75 million tons of oil equivalent).
Oil
4.        Due to the slow pace of exploration activity, oil reserves are not
precisely determined and estimates vary widely even for oil fields already in
production. Estimates of recoverable reserves range from 35 million to 400
million barrels (4.8 million tons to 55 million tons). Production is limited
to six fields and is currently (1977/78) about 9,900 barrels/day (0.45 million
tons/year) and covers 13% of current requirements. The production target for
19782/83 is 36,800 barrels/day which would translate into an average annual
growth rate of about 30% p.a.

LPG
5.        Until recently LPG was a relative unimportant by-product of crude
oil refining. In 1976 production totalled about 22,000 tons and by 1982/83
about 23,600 tons could be produced. Indications are that substantial sur-
pluses would exist by 1982/83.
Hydro
6.        The river Indus and its tributaries - Kabul, Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi,
Beas, Sutlej - form a link between two great national reservoirs, snow and
glaciers in the North and the groundwater of the Indus plain. With the imple-
mentation of the Indus Water Treaty in 1960, Pakistan received 4 rivers -
Indus, e bul, Jhelum and Chenab - with a combined flow of 175 billion m /year
(5,550 m /sec on average).
7.        About one half of the Indus river flow comes from large glaciers and
although the flows are seasonal, variations from year to year are relatively
small. Of the main 3Indus flow below the confluence with the Kabul river about
72% or 88 billion m occurs in the four months June to September. The Jhelum
river's characteristic vary. The mean annual flow is about 1/3 of the Indus,
is more variable and only 54% (15 billion m ) are concentrated in the months
June to September.
8.        From the viewpoint of hydro-electric potential, the Kabul and Chenab
rivers are of less importance. Almost all of the hydro potential is thus
located on the Indus and Jhelum rivers in the north. This potential has been
estimated at about 25,000 MW, of which 1,567 MW has been exploited to date.
In the period 1978/79-1982/83 an additional 1,330 MW will be installed so that
by 1982/83 about 13% of the potential will be exploited.
9.        The larger unexploited hydro sites identified to date are about 18
totalling about 17,000 MW and ranging in size from 110 MW - 2,000 MW. To fur-
ther improve available information on the hydro potential and to assist future
planning of generating faccilities, WAPDA will carry out a study, supplemented
by field investigation, to rank identified hydro sites according to technical
and economic merit.  A feasibility study is also planned of the 1,760 MW
Kalabagh site on the Indus river downstream of Tarbela.
10.       Smaller hydro sites in the range of 100-200 kW are numerous but
costs/kW are high. The Technology Development Organization of GOP is working
on micro hydro plants with the objective of developing an indigenous tech-
nology with simple design, low costs, and civil works that can be carried
out by the local people who would benefit from the plants.
Historical Energy Growth Patterns and Forecast Demand
11.       The breakdown of commercial energy demand by primary energy sources
shows that natural gas and hydro electricity have become increasingly important.



- 43 -
ANNEX 1
Page 3
The change in relative consumption patterns is a direct consequence of govern-
ment policy which has aimed at replacing petroleum consumption by natural gas
and hydro electricity. Current projections show that this trend is likely to
stabilize in the future.

Source:   The Fifth Plan 1978-83:  Energy
12.       In the period 1973/74-1977/78 hydro increased its share from 14.85
to 20.6% due to the commissioning of units at Mangla and Tarbela. With the
further expansion at Tarbela a further increrase to 24.4% is forecast by
1982/83. The share of natural gas, 35.4% in 1973/74 and 34.1% in 1977/78 is
forecast to remain stable accounting for 35.45% in 1982/83. The share of crude
oil (net of exports) shows a declining trend from 42.2% in 1973/74 to 38.6%
in 1977/78 with a further decline to 34.3% forecast for 1982/83. In absolute
terms, however, oil and petroleum products will show an increase from about
168 trillion BTU in 1977/78 to about 220 trillion BTU in 1982/83. Overall,
the growth rate of commercial energy demand is forecast for the five years
1977/78-1982/83 at 8% p.a.
13.       The principal consuming sectors are industry (including fertilizer
production), 42%; followed by transportation, 17%, and power, 17%. As of 1975,
the consumption of commercial energy per capita was 0.12 tons of oil equiv-
alent which compares with a world average of 1.37 tons, an average for devel-
oping countries of 0.27 tons, and 0.15 tons and 0.02 tons, respectively, for
India and Bangladesh.
Energy Policies
Resource Development
14.       GOP's policy in the development of energy resources is aimed at a
reduction of dependence on imported energy. Emphasis has, therefore, been
placed on the development and use of hydro energy; the construction of extra
high voltage transmission lines from Tarbela to the south to reduce trans-
mission losses and fuel consumption; the exploration for fossil fuel resources



- 44 -
ANNEX 1
Page 4
and the development of proven oil and gas fields; the promotion of use of gas
by industries; and the maximization of the use of coal resources.
15.       Based on the above general policy guidelines the Planning Commission
in the Ministry of Finance has suggested the following measures to encourage
energy production and consumption efficiency, and to reduce demand growth:
(i) reduction of power system losses; (ii) economic dispatch and load manage-
ment; (iii) direct use of gas for space heating; (iv) load factor improvement;
(v) rehabilitation of the secondary transmission system; and (vi) improved
distribution systems.
16.       The importance that has been attributed to developing indigenous
energy resources is reflected in the volume of resources allocated to the
energy sector in the period 1978/79-1982/83. Approximately Rs 35,500 million
(US$3.6 billion) is allocated to energy sector investment which represents
22% of total public investment during the period.
17.       The bulk of the investment is in the power sector - Rs 27,900 mil-
lion of which Rs 21,500 million is by the W4ater and Power Development Authority
(WAPDA); Rs 2,600 million by the Karachi Electricity Supply Company (KESC);
Rs 3,000 million by the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC); Rs 800
million by the Multan Electricity Supply Company (MESCO) and the Rawalpindi
Electric Power Company (REPCO) (both licenses distributing WAPDA power);
and for power projects in underdeveloped areas.
18.       Only modest investment is contemplated for coal.  In the oil and
gas subsector, however, about Rs 5,600 million has been earmarked for public
investment.
2.   Institutional
19.       Four Ministries are involved in planning of the energy sector:
Finance and Planning; Water and Power; Petroleum and National Resources; and
Science and Technology. Overall planning is carried out by the Planning Com-
mission - under the Ministry of Finance. Although considerable progress has
been made at the policy level to provide the incentives to bring about a rapid
development of Pakistan's resources, a policy-making body is still lacking to
formulate and coordinate a coherent energy policy, especially in regard to
pricing of various energy products which have adversely affected supply and
demand patterns.
3.   Pricing
20.       Energy pricing policy has been guided by a two-fold strategy.  On
the production side, incentives have been provided to stimulate exploration
for and development of petroleum. Well-head prices for new oil discoveries
are based on import parity. On the consumer side, the government has endeav-
oured to protect key productive sectors as well as some consumers from the
major repercussions that would have been caused by a sudden rise in domestic
prices for electricity and petroleum. As a consequence, cross-subsidization



- 45 -
ANNEX 1
Page 5
policies have been adopted in regard to electricity tariffs and petroleun
products.
21.       The Planning Commission recognizes that energy pricing suffers from
distortions. For instance, the prices per million BTU vary from Rs 100 for
high octane gasoline to Rs 9 for gas for use in the cement industry. In
particular, natural gas prices are low in comparison with alternative oil
products.
22.       To rectify this situation and to assist GOP to formulate policies
and programs in the energy sector, a study is to be undertaken in connection
with the Toot Oil Project (Credit 867-PAK) with the objective of reviewing
relative costs and prices among petroleum products and between alternative
competing fuels to identify adjustments which would lead to a more economic
consumption pattern.

THIRD POWER PROJECT
Secondary Transmission Program - FY 1979/80 - 1982/83
ProJect Description
The Project covers the last four years of WAPDA's Third Secondary Tranmission
Grid Program (1978/79 - 1982/83) and comprises (a) the erection of about 2,700 miles
of 220 KV, 132 KV and 66 KV single and double circuit lines and (b) the construction,
expansion and conversion of 216 substations of 220/132 KV and 132/66/33/11 KV with
an aggregate capacity of about 4,800 KVA. The Project also includes the construction
of warehouses for the storage of equipment and materials and two studies covering
(i) a load dispatch system and (ii) problems arising from the 220 KV to 500 KV
conversion program. The materials and equipment required for the construction program
are shown in detail below.

Notes and Assumptions for Financial Forecasts
INCOME STATEMENT
Sale of Electricity
Forecast sales of electricity are based on projected plant expan-
sion. This is realistic inasmuch as the demand potential is estimated to
be in excess of WAPDA's capacity to supply throughout the forecast period.
Increase in sales is forecast at an average annual increase of about 13.5%
through FY84.
Average Revenue per kWh Sold
The average revenue per kWh sold reflects the 25% tariff increase,
which was effective July 1, 1979, and two agreed increases of 10% to be
effective July 1, 1979 and 1980.
Other Operating Revenue
Other operating revenue consists principally of the fuel surcharge.
Fuel Cost
The cost of fuel has been forecast taking into account existing
fuel prices and planned thermal generation in each of the forecast years.
A provision has been made for an annual 10% price escalation. At July 1978,
the cost of fuel to WAPDA was as follows:

Operation, Maintenance and Administration
Forecasts assume an annual increase of 20%, 9% for the system's
expansion and a price increase of 11%. WAPDA has been making a provision
for bad debts of .005% of revenues billed, and the annual allocation being
made to an insurance reserve fund amounts to Rs 7 million (see para 2.27
of text); forecasts assume the same provision and allocation.
Depreciation
WAPDA is applying a composite rate of depreciation of 3.5%. This
rate is realistic and has been used in the forecasts (see para 5.16 of text).
Other Income
Other income includes interest, sale of scrap and rental of office
space, and is shown to increase nominally.
Payment to Government
WAPDA has been remitting Rs 20 million annually to Government for
assets earlier transferred to WAPDA. Forecasts show this payment continuing.
BALANCE SHEET
Cash
Cash balances are projected on the basis of two months' cash operat-
ing expense.
Inventories
Inventories are forecast as a percentage of fixed assets in opera-
tion. Materials management being one of the areas under review for improve-
ment, the forecasts show the percentage declining from 3.5% in 1978 to 2.5%
in FY84.
Accounts Receivable
Forecasts assume that as in the past WAPDA will maintain its
accounts receivable within a three-month billing level.
Other Current Assets
Other current assets include receivables, advances and clearing
accounts. Taking into account the annual increase in electricity generated
and consumers connected, forecasts assume an annual 10% increase.



ANNEX 16

Current Liabilities
Current liabilities include payables, deposits and clearing accounts.
Forecasts assume that current liabilities would maintain the same ratio to
current assets as the average that prevailed during the three fiscal years
ending June 30, 1978.
Price Escalation
Annual inflation factors of 11% and 8% have been allowed respec-
tively for local costs and foreign costs.

THIRD WAPDA POWER PROJECT
Internal Economic Rate of Return
1.        The internal economic rate of return (IERR) on the project has been
calculated based on a time slice of WAPDA's overall investment program for
the period covered by the project (1978/79 - 1982/83). For the purpose of
this calculation all costs and benefits are in constant 1978/79 rupees -
border prices. Construction costs are net of interest during construction
and exclude costs of generation projects which will come on stream only after
1984, and for which incremental benefits are not claimed. Operation and main-
tenance costs are based on 2.5% of the capital cost of thermal installations
and 0.5% of the capital cost of transmission/distribution (in 1978/79 prices).
The average tariff levels (in 1978/79 prices) of 0.3502 rupees per kwh sold in
1978/79 and 0.4150 from 1979/80 onwards were taken as the proxies in establish-
ing the benefit stream and this was multiplied by the standard conversion
factor of 0.85 to convert to border prices. Since consumer surplus is
ignored, this is a minimum estimate of benefits.
2.        The streams of costs and benefits based on the above assumptions
and those detailed in paragraph 3 are shown in Table 1. An internal rate of
return of about 11% was obtained which is near the opportunity cost of capital
in Pakistan, and thus demonstrates that the mean level of current tariffs is
close to the average incremental cost of supply, based on the five-year invest-
ment program.

3.        General Assumptions
(a) O&M and administrative costs in market prices are converted
to border prices by using the standard conversion factor
of 0.85;
(b) the benefit stream is obtained by multiplying the kWh sales
for each year by (i) rupees 0.3502 per kWh in 1978/79 and
0.4150 from 1979/80 onwards (in 1978/79 prices); and (ii) the
standard conversion factor (0.85);
(c) local construction costs are converted to border prices by
using the local construction cost conversion factor of 0.82;
this is based on a conversion factor of 0.75 applied to a
30% cost component for unskilled labor, and the standard
conversion factor (0.85) applied to the remaining 70% of
local costs;
(d) fuel costs were based on the 1978/79 international prices
for the grades of fuel used.
