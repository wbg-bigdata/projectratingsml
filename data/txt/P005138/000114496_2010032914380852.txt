                      SCHEDULE 4
           Terms and conditions of onlending
          under the Subsidiary Loan Agreement
   The following terms for onlending the proceeds of the
Loan from the Borrower to PBDAC shall be included in the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement:
   The Borrower, acting through its Central Bank, shall
maintain the following two accounts for purposes of
repayment of and interest payment on the Subsidiary Loan:
   (a)   The Local Currency Account: to which there
shall be debited the equivalent in Egyptian pounds of
currencies withdrawn from the Loan Account to meet
expenditures incurred and paid by PBDAC in Egyptian
pounds. Such equivalent shall be determined as of the
respective dates of withdrawal from the Loan Account.
Amounts debited to said account shall be repaid by PBDAC
to the Borrower over a period of 20 years, including a
grace period of five years, with interest at the annual
rate determined, from time to time, by the National
Investment Bank of the Borrower to be applicable to
PBDAC; and
   (b)   The Foreign Currency Account: to which there
shall be debited all amounts of foreign currencies (that
is all currencies other than Egyptian pounds) withdrawn
from the Loan Account to meet expenditures incurred and
paid directly by PBDAC in said foreign currencies. Debt
service payments with respect to amounts debited to such
account shall be made by PBDAC to the Borrower (i) over
the same maturity period specified for the Loan pursuant
to Schedule 3 to the Loan Agreement, (ii) at the same
rates of interest applicable during such maturity period
to the Loan pursuant to Section 2.05 of the Loan
Agreement, and (iii) in the Egyptian Pounds equivalent
(determined as of the respective dates of debt service
payments in accordance with the commercial banks'
exchange rates) to the amounts of currency or currencies
in which the Borrower's debt service obligation, with
respect to such amount, shall be payable to the Bank.
                      SCHEDULE 5
                    Special Account
Page  10
1. For the purposes of this Schedule:
   (a)   the term "eligible Categories" means the
Categories set forth in the table in paragraph 1 of
Schedule 1 to this Agreement;
   (b)   the term "eligible expenditures" means
expenditures in respect of the reasonable cost of goods
and services required for the Project and to be financed
out of the proceeds of the Loan allocated from time to
time to the eligible Categories in accordance with the
provisions of Schedule 1 to this Agreement; and
   (c)    the term "Authorized Allocation" means an
amount equivalent to $3,000,000 to be withdrawn from the
Loan Account and deposited into the Special Account
pursuant to paragraph 3 (a) of this Schedule.
2. Payments out of the Special Account shall be made
exclusively for eligible expenditures in accordance with
the provisions of this Schedule.
3. After the Bank has received evidence satisfactory to
it that the Special Account has been duly opened,
withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation and subsequent
withdrawals to replenish the Special Account shall be
made as follows:
   (a)   For withdrawals of the Authorized Allocation,
the Borrower shall furnish to the Bank a request or
requests for a deposit or deposits which do not exceed
the aggregate amount of the Authorized Allocation. On the
basis of such request or requests, the Bank shall, on
behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from the Loan Account
and deposit in the Special Account such amount or amounts
as the Borrower shall have requested.
   (b)   (i)    For replenishment of the Special
                Account, the Borrower shall furnish to
                the Bank requests for deposits into the
                Special Account at such intervals as the
                Bank shall specify.
         (ii)   Prior to or at the time of each such
                request, the Borrower shall furnish to
                the Bank the documents and other
                evidence required pursuant to paragraph
                4 of this Schedule for the payment or
                payments in respect of which
                replenishment is requested. On the basis
                of each such request, the Bank shall, on
                behalf of the Borrower, withdraw from
                the Loan Account and deposit into the
                Special Account such amount as the
                Borrower shall have requested and as
                shall have been shown by said documents
                and other evidence to have been made out
                of the Special Account for eligible
                expenditures.
All such deposits shall be withdrawn by the Bank from the
Loan Account under the respective eligible Categories,
and in the respective equivalent amounts, as shall have
been justified by said documents and other evidence.
4. For each payment made by the Borrower out of the
Special Account, the Borrower shall, at such time as the
Bank shall reasonably request, furnish to the Bank such
documents and other evidence showing that such payment
was made exclusively for eligible expenditures.

5. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 3 of this
Schedule, the Bank shall not be required to make further
deposits into the Special Account:
   (a)   if, at any time, the Bank shall have determined
that all further withdrawals should be made by the
Borrower directly from the Loan Account in accordance
with the provisions of Article V of the General
Conditions and paragraph (a) of Section 2.02 of this
Agreement; or
   (b)   once the total unwithdrawn amount of the Loan
allocated to the eligible Categories less the amount of
any outstanding special commitment entered into by the
Bank pursuant to Section 5.02 of the General Conditions,
shall equal the equivalent of twice the amount of the
Authorized Allocation.
Thereafter, withdrawal from the Loan Account of the
remaining unwithdrawn amount of the Loan shall follow
such procedures as the Bank shall specify by notice to
the Borrower. Such further withdrawals shall be made only
after and to the extent that the Bank shall have been
satisfied that all such amounts remaining on deposit in
the Special Account as of the date of such notice will be
utilized in making payments for eligible Expenditures.
6. (a)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any payment out of the Special Account: (i) was made
for an expenditure or in an amount not eligible pursuant
to paragraph 2 of this Schedule; (ii) was not justified
by the evidence furnished to the Bank, the Borrower
shall, promptly upon notice from the Bank: (A) provide
such additional evidence as the Bank may request; or (B)
deposit into the Special Account (or, if the Bank shall
so request, refund to the Bank) an amount equal to the
amount of such payment or the portion thereof not so
eligible or justified. Unless the Bank shall otherwise
agree, no further deposit by the Bank into the Special
Account shall be made until the Borrower has provided
such evidence or made such deposit or refund, as the case
may be.
   (b)   If the Bank shall have determined at any time
that any amount outstanding in the Special Account will
not be required to cover further payments for eligible
expenditures, the Borrower shall, promptly upon notice
from the Bank, refund to the Bank such outstanding
amount.
   (c)   The Borrower may, upon notice to the Bank,
refund to the Bank all or any portion of the funds on
deposit in the Special Account.
   (d)   Refunds to the Bank made pursuant to paragraphs
6 (a), (b) and (c) of this Schedule shall be credited to
the Loan Account for subsequent withdrawal or for
cancellation in accordance with the relevant provisions
of this Agreement, including the General Conditions.
