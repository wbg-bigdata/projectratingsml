MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
FOR AN AGRICULTURAL STORAGE PROJECT
1.       I submit for approval the following memorandum and recommendation on
a proposed loan to Egypt for US$40.0 million. The proposed loan would be for
20 years, including a five-year grace period, at the standard variable
interest rate linked to the borrowing costs of the Bank, and would help
finance an Agricultural Storage Project. The Principal Bank for Development
and Agricultural Credit (PBDAC) would contribute the remaining US$63.1 million
of the project cost.
2.                 .  Agriculture is an important sector in the Egyptian
economy contributing about 20Z of GDP and providing employment to 382 of the
work force. Agroclimatic conditions give the country a comparative advantage
in the sector. However, because of the severe land constraint (the per capita
arable land is only 0.05 hectares, one of the lowest in the world), pervasive
state intervention which has distorted farmers' incentives, and iradequate
support services, Egypt moved, in the last three decades, from a -aet exporter
to a significant importer of agricultural commodities. In 1987, the value of
agricultural commodity im?orts (excluding production inputs) was US$2 billion,
and the agricultural trade deficit exceeded US$1.5 billion. This deficit is
an important factor in the country's deteriorating foreign exchange
situation. To alleviate the situation, the country has, in response to a
continuing dialogue with the Bank and other donors, taken a number of measures
to improve sectoral efficiency through a policy reform program. These include
relaxation of several regulatory laws, removal of price controls and acreage
restrictions on most crops, phased programs to eliminate subsidies, and
lifting of trade restrictions in much of the agricultural sector. Further,
GOE has also taken steps to improve the efficiency of basic services to the
farmers, notably through an on-going reform of the agricultural research and
extension system. However, its input delivery system, though well organized,
is constrained by the shortage of covered warehouse capacity. This shortage
causes both quality deterioration as well as physical losses and adds to the
avoidable foreign exchange burden of GOE. Conservative estimates put these
losses at US$33 million per annum. In the related area of agricultural input
marketing too, GOE is looking at ways of enhancing efficiency and
competitiveness and has commissioned a study to develop alternative options.
3.       Much of the agricultural storage system is managed by PBDAC through
an extensive network of open-air storage sites which include some warehouses.
These facilities, though well-distributed within the country, are very
inadequately developed. Most fertilizers, and all grains and animal feed are
stored in the open. With over six million tons of annual throughput, the
physical and quality losses resulting from direct exposure to sunlight, heat,
moisture, insect, bird and rodent damage and nonrecoverable spillage on bare
ground are heavy. The country cannot continue to incur these losses;
therefore, constructing new warehouses and improving their management is an
urgent issue.

-2-
4.       Rationale fo Bank Involvement. Egypt annually imports the bulk of
its food and feedgrrains requirements and sizeable quantities of fertilizers
and pesticides. This causes a mounting pressure on the country's foreign
exchange resources. At the same time, its ability to properly store these
commodities (except for imported wheat) is grossly deficient, and heavy losses
are incurred by PBDAC--the principal agency responsible for procurement and
distribution of most of the inputs. While the Bank has supported a number of
projects in Egypt which focused on increasing the country's agricultural
production, it has not yet financed any infrastructure project to reduce
wastage in storage and handling of agricultural commodities. GOE has accorded
a high priority to improved agricultural storage in the current Five-Year
Plan, and has also accepted some donor assistance to construct some
warehouses. But the overall scale of activities has remained very small. At
the same time, the private sector is shy of investing in agricultural storage,
inter alia, due to the long-term nature of the investment and the emergence of
other more lucrative business opportunities in the wake of GOE's on-going
sectoral reform program. The proposed project is intended to assist GOE to
(i) take an overall view of the country's net storage requirements;
(ii) identify appropriate and economic designs, capacities and locations for
new warehouses; and (iii) efficiently implement the project with the required
technical and financial assistance. This would strengthen, in a substantial
way, a weak link in Egypt's agricultural marketing chain, provide farmers with
agricultural inputs in bags of proper weight and quality, and create an
infrastructure which is a necessary prerequisite for an efficient marketing
system.
5.       Project      ives.  The main objectives of the project are:  (i) to
assist the country to modernize and expand the agricultural storage
infrastructure; and (ii) to improve the handling of agricultural inputs,
grains and animal feed through appropriate mechanization and the training of
storage personnel. This would help GOE to (i) reduce physical losses in the
storage and distribution of agricultural inputs; (ii) minimize the
deterioration in the quality of products handled; (iii) reduce product
handling and storage costs; and (iv) improve the efficiency in fertilizer and
animal feed transport. In addition, the project would also assist GOE plan
appropriate infrastructure for the bulk storage and distribution of imported
feedgrains at selected ports and inland locations.
6.       ProjeDt DiDti0!.  The project would provide for (i) the
construction of nearly 0.9 million tons of covered warehouse capacity for flat
storage; (ii) the repair and rehabilitation of existing capacities of about
0.5 million tons; (iii) the construction of a 60,000 ton temporary bulk
handling and storage facility for imported yellow corn near the port of
unloading; (iv) the procurement of handling and other equipment needed for new
and rehabilitated warehouses; (v) the hiring of engineering consultants to
assist in the design, procurement and construction/inttallation of these
facilities; (vii) the technical assistance for developing management
information systems, rationalized transportation arrangements and suitable
training programs; (vii) the upgrading of the management and technical skills
of the staff responsible for storage operations; and (viii) a study to develop
an investment proposal for the importation, handling, storage and distribution
of feedgrains (mostly yellow corn).

7.       The total cost of the proposed projects to be implemented over a
five-year period, is estimated at US$103.1 million equivalent, with a foreign
exchange component of US$40.0 million (391). A breakdown of costs and the
financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement
and disbursements, and the disbursement schedule, are shown in Schedule B. A
timetable of key project events and the status of Bank Group operations in
Egypt are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. A map (IBRD No. 21442)
and the Staff Appraisal Report, No. 7590-EGT, dated April 25, 1989 are also
attached.
8.       Actions Agreed.  The main actions agreed with GOE/PBDAC are the
following: (i) the conditions of loan effectiveness would include (a) the
execution of a subsidiary loan agreement between GOE/PBDAC which is
satisfactory to the Bank, (b) the selection of engineering consultants
satisfactory to the Bank, (c) the appointment of a Project coordinator, and
(d) the finalization of the selection of at least On sites (401 of total) for
construction of warehouses; (ii) GOE would make available to the Bank the
findings of the study which is currently being undertaken by PBDAC to develop
options for enhancing private participation in the distribution of
agricultural inputs, and would subsequently exchange views with the Bank as to
the measures and the time-table for implementing the selected option; (iii)
PBDAC would conduct a mid-term review of the Project not later than December
31, 1992; (iv) PBDAC would follow, in its network of agricultural warehouses,
sound environmental protection practices as spelled out in the Project
agreement; and (v) GOE/PBDAC would comply with the Bank's procurement
procedures and ensure full cost recovery.
9.       Benefits.  On completion, the project would annually save about
60,000 tons of fertilizers, 17,000 tons of animal feed, and 22,000 tons of
grains valued at US$22 million equivalent in 1988 constant dollars. In
addition, it would introduce cost effective transport and distribution
arrangements of agricultural inputs. By reducing the rodent and insect
infestation problems and the spillage of fertilizers and toxic material on
bare ground, the project would have a favorable environmental impact. The
internal economic rate of return is 22X.
10.      Risks.  Implementation delay is a potential risk.  This risk is
minimized through GOE's agreement to hire engineering consultants to assist
PBDAC in the preparation of detailed designs and specifications and the
supervision of construction. Delays and shortfalls arising out of GOE's
budgetary procedures are obviated by PBDAC agreeing to provide the counterpart
funds required for project implementation and operation of the storage
facilities. Land acquisition will not slow down project implementation, as
almost all the sites are already in the possession of PBDAC. A second risk is
that GOE sectoral reforms may lead to the divestiture of PBDAC's commercial
functions which would necessitate the transfer of storage facilities to
successor institutions/agencies. However, in designing the Project, careful
consideration has been given to this aspect; the project as designed is
neutral to ownership. Furthermore, the design and capacity of the warehouse
modules proposed in the Project (1,000 ton units with possibility of further
subdivisions, if necessary), have been governed, inter alia, by the
consideration that these structures will eventually be owned/operated by

private business enterprises. The Project Agreement also provides for a
midterm review to-examine the need for change, if any, in the design and scope
of the project.
11.      Recommendatioa.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the
Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.
