MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF SRI LANKA
FOR A COLOMBO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
1.    I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendaton on a
proposed development credit to the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for SDR 24.8
million (US$39.0 million equivalent) to help finance a Colombo Environmental Improvement
Project. The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 40
years. Part of the proceeds of the credit would be onlent to the Colombo Municipal
Council (CMC) and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDl) for 20
years, including six years of grace, on a variable interest rate basis not below the average
weighted deposit rate on interest bearing deposits of domestic commercial banks and
adjustable every six months. The Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) would bear the
foreign exchange risk.
2.    Background. Sri Lanka has a richly varied natural resource base, a moderately
expanding population covered by extensive social services and an adult literacy rate of almost
90%. With such an economic infrastructure and human resource base, GOSL is gearing up to
propel the economy into the mainstream of growth by fostering private sector-led and
environmentally friendly industrial growth, stimulating agriculture to diversify into new crops
and export-oriented products, and consolidating Sri Lanka's natural, strategic position by
developing the Colombo port into a competitive regional transshipment center.
3.    The Colombo Metropolitan Area (CMA), which comprises the Colombo Municipal
Council (CMC) and 30 other local authorities in the Colombo, Kalutara and Gampaha Districts
of the Western Province, is the most developed region in Sri Lanka. With over four million
inhabitants, the CMA contains a quarter of Sri Lanka's total population, accounts for above
70% of the country's industrial activities, and generates over 40% of the island's gross domestic
product. This concentration of population, industrial and commercial activities in about 5% of
the total land area of Sri Lanka, places a severe strain on the existing municipal infrastructure.
Notwithstanding GOSL's preference for a more balanced regional development, most of the
new industrial growth can be expected to be sited in the CMA, which is already bearing the
brunt of existing urban and industrial pollution.
4.    With the foresight that Sri Lanka has the opportunity to pursue economic (levelopment
in an ecologically sensitive manner, GOSL has taken a series of legislative initiatives toward
protecting the environment. The National Environmental Act of 1980 establishes a.
comprehensive national environmental policy. In 1982, GOSL created the Central



-2 -
Environmental Authority (CEA) with policy and regulatory functions. Under the National
Environmental (Amendment) Act of 1988, three new instruments were introduced for
enhancing environmental protection; these are the requirement of Initial Environmental
Examination and Environmental Impact Assessment for approval of projects, the designation of
environmental protection areas, and the environmental protection license scheme to enforce
industrial effluents discharge standards.
5.    To set a framework for tackling priority environmental issues, GOSL with IDA's
assistance prepared a National Environmental Action Plan (NEAP) in 1991. Many of the
actions in the NEAP are directed to address the pollution problems and environmental
degradation in the CMA; these include the deteriorating quality of surface and groundwater,
pollution from the use of open dumps for solid and hazardous wastes, and degradation of the
area's water bodies caused by uncontrolled discharge of domestic and industrial wvastewaters.
Beira Lake, a distinctive landmark in the center of Colombo and once an economic and
aesthetic asset, is now a polluted water body and a public health hazard. Industrial wastewater
pollution has been especially severe in the Ratmalana/Moratuwa area south of Colombo where
the Lunawa Lagoon, which supported a significant fisheries industry a decade ago, is totally
devoid of aquatic life today. Stemming from the NEAP and with the assistance of international
consultants engaged under the IDA-executed Metropolitan Environmental Improvement
Program, the preparation of an Environmental Management Strategy (EMS) and Action Plan
for Greater Colombo was completed in 1994. The proposed project is based on the prioritized
actions in the Colombo EMS.
6.     7hile the existing legislation covers the entire range of environmental concerns, there
is a lack of implementation and enforcement. Apart from the shortage of funds for investment
in urban infrastructure, the lack of institutional capabilities at the CEA to enforce the existing
regulations and standards, and insufficient local government attention to adequate cost recovery
measures are constraints to implementing environmental management programs. To help
address the above constraints, the proposed project would assist the CMC and other local
authorities to operationalize sound solid waste management systems and seek private sector
participation under concession arrangements. The project would also provide technical
assistance to strengthen UDA's capability in integrated urban planning, with a particular focus
on environmental planning and management. Institution-building technical assistance to CEA
would be provided under the proposed Sri Lanka Environmental Action I Project which is
under preparation.
7.    Rationale for IDA Involvement. The proposed operation is consistent with IDA's
country assistance strategy for Sri Lanka. The strategy discussed by the Board of Executive
Directors on December 10, 1992 seeks and supports reforms by GOSL to (a) improve the
climate for private initiatives and for export growth and diversification; (b) improve public
sector management of human and physical resources with a view to preserving the country's
outstanding social achievements and encouraging private sector participation; and (c)
strengthen public finances through containment of current expenditures and a more rapid
divestiture of Government holdings in public enterprises. The strategy also supports programs
that contribute to improved environmental management and long-term sustainable economic



-3 -
development, particularly through lending support in urban infrastructure. The proposed
project responds to GOSL's priority for addressing growing environmental problems related to
the concentration of economic activity in and around Colombo. The project complements and
reinforces the Bank group operations such as the Colombo Urban Transport Project (Cr. 2495-
CE) and the proposed Sri Lanka Environmental Action I Project in their institutional support
for key agencies involved in environmental protection activities. The project would also
support GOSL's effort to seek private participation in delivering urban infrastructure services
under Build, Operate and Own (BOO) and concession contracts. IDA is well-placed to
provide assistance because of its involvement in the formulation of the NEAP and Colombo
EMS and its ability to catalyze, through policy dialogue with GOSL and project financing, the
implementation of interventions needed to improve waste management and safeguard the
environment.
8.    Project Objectives. The overall objective of the project is to contribute to a sustainable
environment for the long term economic and social development of the CMA. Soecific
objectives of the project are to: (a) improve municipal solid waste management and services
in the CMC and participating local authorities; (b) reduce wastewater pollution in the Beira
Lake catchment area and selected industrialized zones; (c) develop the capabilities of local
governments and institutions to plan and manage municipal services in a sustainable,
environmentally beneficial manner; and (d) assist in mobilizing private participation in the
development and operations of urban infrastructure services.
9.    Project Description. To achieve the project objectives, the project consists of the
following components:
(a)    municipal solid waste management comprising: (i) construction of a sanitary
landfill of 3.5 million cubic meters capacity to replace open dumps -- operation
of the landfill will be contracted out to a private sector operator; (ii) provision
of equipment for safe collection, transport and disposal of clinica' wastes
generated in the CMA; and (iii) technical assistance to CMC and other local
authorities in the CMA for contracting out solid waste collection services and
for developing a long term solid waste disposal strategy;
(b)   industrial wastewater pollution abatement for (i) construction of sewer
networks in the two industrialized areas, Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela, to collect
and carry industrial and domestic wastewaters to two separate wastewater
treatment plants to be built and operated by private investors; anc (ii) technical
assistance for the solicitation and evaluation of BOO/BOT proposals for the
two wastewater treatment plants mentioned above;
(c)    Beira Lake catchment pollution control for (i) connection of wastewater outlets
to the sewerage system, rehabilitation of pumping stations and addition of a
sewer line; and (ii) technical assistance for formulating further restoration
measures for the lake;



- 4 -
(d)   institution building technical assistance to UDA for strengthening its
capabilities in integrated urban planning, including support for the
establishment of a geographic information system for Greater Colombo, and
consultancy services for updating the Colombo Development Master Plan and
preparing a Trincomalee regional infrastructure development plan; and
(e)   project implementation support consultancy services.
10.   The project cost is estimated at US$49.0 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$20.9 million equivalent (43%) and taxes and duties estimated at about
US$4.6 million equivalent. IDA will finance US$39.0 million equivalent (100% of the foreign
exchanges and 64% of the local costs). A breakdown of project costs and the financing plan
are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of disbursement, and the
disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events
and the status of Bank Group operations in Sri Lanka are presented in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 12878-CE, dated
June 2, 1995, is being distributed separately.
11.   Project Implementation. Project implementation responsibilities rest with CMC for the
municipal solid waste management component, with NWSDB for the wastewater collection
systems at Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela, and with UDA for the Beira Lake catchment pollution
control and institution-building technical assistance. The credit proceeds would be passed on
to CMC, NWSDB and UDA under separate Project Implementation Agreements to be
executed between GOSL and each of the above agencies. Consultants from reputable
international engineering firms will be engaged to assist in carrying out procurement and
construction supervision. Taking into account the lack of local expertise in modem sanitary
landfills, construction and operation of the landfill will be procured through two separate but
linked contracts. One contract (Contract A) comprises detailed design and phased construction
of the landfill site and other associated facilities, and procurement of mobile equipment
required for the landfill operation; the second contract (Contract B) will commence once initial
construction is complete and the site is ready to receive wastes and will include operation of the
landfill site and progressive restoration of the finished surface. These two contracts will be
tendered under one package and awarded at the same time to the same contractor following
international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures. The proposed credit would finance
Contract A only; CMC and other participating local authorities would jointly meet the operating
costs of the landfill under Contract B subject to the contractor's meeting industry standard
efficiency norms.
12.   To enhance public participation and support for the project implementation, UDA will
carry out an environmental public awareness program under the project; also, a Public
Consultation Panel comprising five representatives from citizens' groups including non-
governmental organizations and four representatives from the concerned Government agencies
has been established. The composition of the panel, its terms of reference and modality of
operations have been agreed with IDA. The panel will invite public comments through



- 5 -
organized forums, conduct semi-annual review of project progress and make recommendations
to the project implementing agencies.
13.   The project implementation is starting and is given top prionrty by GOSL.
Prequalification of contractors for the landfill contracts is now underway; contracts are
expected to be awarded by March 1996. Terms of reference and shortlists for project
implementation support consultancies were agreed and proposals invited; consultants are to be
appointed by October 1995.
14.   Project Sustainabilitv. The project is designed to enhance the environment of the
CMA. The public awareness program and consultation process will continue throughout the
project implementation period to maximize the project results. These, together with the cost
recovery mechanisms agreed under the project, will ensure project sustainability
15.   Agreed Actions. During negotiations agreements were reached with GCSL and
project implementing agencies as follows:
(a)    CMC and other local authorities using the landfill will: (i) open smcd maintain
an escrow account with a financial intermediary for the purpose of making
payments to the landfill operator; (ii) commencing at least three inonths prior to
the date when the site is ready to receive wastes, make monthly deposits into
the escrow account based on the projected tonnages of wastes and the cost-
sharing formula agreed by CMC and participating local authorities; and (iii)
maintain the balance in the escrow account at a level sufficient tc cover three
months of the operating expenses of the landfill;
(b)   commencing January 1, 1996, CMC and NWSDB will establish a dedicated
source of funding for the operations of the Colombo sewerage system
satisfactory to IDA; and
(c)    GOSL will: (i) cause to be completed by June 30, 1997 an industrial effluent
discharge standards compliance program for the industries in Ratmalana and
Ekala/Ja-Ela; and (ii) arrange funds from alternative sources for the
construction of the two wastewater treatment plants in the event that private
sector interest fails to materialize.
16.   On actions to be completed before credit effectiveness, (a) CMC will appoint a
supervisory consultant for the solid waste management component; (b) NWSDB/UDA will
appoint consultants for design and construction supervision of the wastewater collection
systems and the Beira Lake catchment area sewerage works; and (c) NWSDB will appoint a
consultant to assist with the solicitation and evaluation of BOO/BOT proposals for the
wastewater treatment plants.
17.   Environmental Aspects. Because the project involves construction of a major sanitary
landfill, it is a category A project under IDA's Operational Directive for environmental



-6 -
screening. As part of the project preparation, a full environmental impact assessment (EIA) of
the proposed sanitary landfill was prepared by international consultants on behalf of the
Borrower in accordance with IDA's guidelines. The landfill site at Welisara was chosen from
a shortlist of six sites after detailed evaluation. Located approximately 10 km north of
Colombo, the landfill site covers approximately 50 hectares. The area is not suitable for
cropping because of salinity and does not contain flora and fauna of ecological significance.
More than 90% of the required land is owned by GOSL; population displacement by the
landfill is minimal, involving only one family who has accepted the compensation package for
resettlement. Potential significant negative environmental impacts pertain to surface/ground
water contamination which may be caused by improper handling of waste construction
materials during construction of the landfill site or escape of leachate during operation. The
ELA fully addresses these potential impacts and recommends appropriate mitigation measures.
The design of the landfill will incorporate a range of environmental protection measures to
ensure that development and operation of the landfill site does not result in unacceptable
residual impact on the surrounding environment. The proposed credit includes financing of
potable water supply and other infrastructure for the local community residing adjacent to the
landfill site.
18.   Project Benefits. The project addresses underlying causes of environmenta degradation
in the CMA and will benefit over 3 million people who reside in or commute to the project
area. The replacement of open dumps with a controlled sanitary landfill will eliminate
contamination of surface and ground water from open dump seepage or leachates, improve
urban environmental conditions and landscape aesthetics. Improved management of hospital
wastes through specialized collection and safe disposal will lower public health impacts of
uncontrolled disposal of infectious and pathological wastes. The two industrial areas at
Ratmalana and Ekala/Ja-Ela account for about 60% of water-polluting industries in the CMA;
the project-supported sewerage investments would therefore lead to a significant reduction in
the overall pollution contribution of the industrial sector and a general improvement in the
population health in the areas concerned. The interventions in the Beira Lake catchment will
help reduce associated environmental and health hazards and open the way for environmentally
sustainable development of the lake's surrounding area in the longer term. Besides the above
direct benefits, the project would serve to catalyze private participation in the delivery of
critical urban infrastructure services traditionally undertaken by the public sector. This is
expected to contribute to increased service coverage, improved service quality and efficiency.
The project would also have a significant demonstration effect to sensitize other urban
authorities to adopt better managed and environmentally sound wastes management systems.
19.   Since the project has significant environmental and social benefits which are not
easily quantifiable, a rate of return calculated based on the magnitude of cost recovery
would not measure the economic merit of the project; thus, no attempt has been made in
this regard. Instead, using a cost effectiveness approach, the project's physical
investments have been subjected to systematic comparisons of alternatives in terms of
capital and recurrent costs, suitability under local conditions, institutional requirements
and environmental impacts. The selected alternatives would effectively integrate both
environmental and economic objectives, and contribute to enhancing public health and



- 7 -
productivity. The cost recovery measures adopted under the project and private sector
participation in the provision and operation of wastes management services would lead to
a minimal fiscal impact on GOSL's budgetary resources and ensure project sustainability.
The project design incorporates monitoring indicators of both physical progress and
developmental impact.
20.   Project Risks. Potential project risks are: (a) shortfalls in cost recovery to sustain the
operations of the project supported investments; (b) weak enforcement of industrial wastewater
discharge standards, which would reduce pressure on industries to utilize the joint wastewater
collection and treatment systems; and (c) lack of adequate response from the pr.vate sector for
the two wastewater treatment plants. These risks have been recognized and agreement has
been reached on specific actions to minimize their impact (para 15).
21.   Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed development credit wVould comply
with the Articles of Agreement of Association and recommend that the Executive Directors
approve the proposed credit.
