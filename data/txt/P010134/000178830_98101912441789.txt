STAFF PROJECT REPORT
APPRAISAL OF THE SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT-
MAHAKALI HILLS
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Over the past two decades, development activities in Nepal have
been mainly concentrated in the Terai and Kathmandu Valley. This results
from the lack of viable strategy for development of the Hills and Mountains
areas, difficulties of access to these areas, and inadequate resources (both
financial and human).
1.02      The consequence has been a continuing deterioration in the environ-
ment and quality of life in the Hills and Mountains, an area which accounts
for 65% of the population of the country and 83% of its land. Increasing
population pressures on land are giving rise to greater fragmentation of
holdings, lower crop yields leading to a declining ability to meet subsistence
needs and wasting soil and forest resources. Further, limited opportunities
for employment outside agriculture in Hill and Mountain areas necessitate a
search for work and food in other parts of the country. These problems of the
Hills and Mountains are further compounded by the low level of administrative,
social and technical services available.
1.03      In 1975, IDA agreed to assist in the development of the two Hill
districts of Rasuwa and Nuwakot. This integrated rural development project
(Credit 617-NEP) became effective in July, 1976. The project contained
provision for preparation of a second rural development project and which has
been prepared by the Agricultural Projects Services Center of Nepal, with
assistance from the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program. The report "A Feasibility
Study of Integrated Rural Development Project for Mahakali Hills" of November
10, 1978, was the basis of a request from His Majesty's Government of Nepal
(HMG) for IDA assistance in implementation of a project covering the devel-
opment of the three Hill districts of Dandeldhura, Baitadi and Darchula and
located in the far west of Nepal.
1.04      This report is based on the findings of an IDA appraisal mission in
November/December 1978, comprising Mr. C.P.R. Nottidge, Ms. M. Nguyen (IDA),
Messrs. M. Fitzpatrick (Irrigation Consultant), R. Noronha (Sociology Consult-
ant) and R.V. Ramakrishna (Agricultural Consultant).



II. BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Nepal, one of the least developed countries, is divided physically
into three broad ecological zones: the Terai (plains), Hills and Mountains.
These three zones cover respectively 17, 68 and 15% of the total area (140,800
km2).
2.02      Population.  The population of Nepal is now estimated at about 13
million and is distributed as follows: 58% Hills, 34% Terai and 8% Mountains.
The annual national growth rate of 2.1% has shown no perceptible signs of
decrease over recent years. Nearly 96% of Nepal's population lives in rural
areas and for 95% of these residents agriculture is the main source of
livelihood.
2.03      Agricultural Production.  Paddy, wheat, maize and millet form
between 80-90% of the Nepalese diet, except in the high Hills where barley
and potatoes form a significant portion. Cash crops are a minor component of
agricultural production and are produced mainly in the Terai, comprising, even
then, only 8% of total cropped area. Yields are generally low and offer much
scope for improvement.
2.04       In general, the overall picture is one of growing dependence of the
Hills on foodgrains from other parts of the country - mainly the Terai. In
1976, it was estimated that only 8 out of 55 Hill and Mountain districts showed
a food surplus. Increasing population pressures in the Hills and Mountains
necessitates the search for new cultivable areas, but these are not freely
available and involve moving further up steep hillsides, destroying the tree
cover in the process. Trees are destroyed not only in developing new areas
for cultivation but also for wood and foliage required for house building,
fuel and fodder.
2.05      Livestock plays an important role in the way of life of rural Nepal
and forms an integral part of the subsistence diet, more particularly in the
Hills. Almost every farm household maintains some animals; cattle, buffalo,
sheep, goats, pigs and poultry, all providing sources of milk and meat, wool,
manure, draft power and, in some instances, means of transportation. Pro-
ductivity is low, however, because of indifferent genetic stock and poor
feeding. The most serious constraint on livestock production is scarcity of
adequate feed.
2.06      Nutrition.  Zonal differences in production of major food crops are
considerable and when translated into terms of caloric requirements for mini-
mum subsistence, the average family in the Mountains now has enough food for
about 190 days; in the Hills, for 225 days; and in the Terai, for 540 days.
The declining potential of the Mountain and Hill zones to provide subsistence
for its residents is reflected in high infant mortality rates (estimated at



- 3 -
200/1,000 live births), a death rate of children between the ages 1-4 esti-
mated at 39/1,000 and a general lowered resistance to disease. People of Hill
and Mountain areas attempt to overcome food shortages through migration - both
within Nepal and out of the country (mainly to India). Furthermore, employ-
ment opportunities outside agriculture in these areas are almost non-existent.
2.07      Communications.  Despite the fact that Nepal's road system has been
expanding rapidly in recent years, the majority of Hill and Mountain districts
still remain inaccessible to motor transport. Movement of goods in these
areas is by porterage and pack animals with people and animals moving on a
network of long established trails. There are few foot suspension bridges
over larger rivers and either temporary wooden bridges (usable only in the dry
season) or primitive ropeways limit access to many areas for much of the year.
These crossings are the cause of a number of deaths each year.
B. Supporting Services
Agriculture Extension, Research and Training
2.08      Agricultural extension in Nepal is generally weak, reflecting inade-
quate staff and training, limited research and lack of facilities. Extension
at farm level is by Junior Technical Assistants (JTA), supervised by Junior
Technicians (JT) and District Agricultural Officers (DAOs). Hill areas have
about one JTA to every 7,000 farmers. A program to train Village Agricultural
Assistants (VAA) was introduced in 1975 to counteract the national shortage of
JTA and to increase local participation in agricultural extension activities.
VAA have proven to be effective extension agents.
2.09      Agricultural research is carried out at 7 research stations, 6 agri-
cultural farms, 22 horticultural farms, 8 livestock farms and 6 fish farms
located throughout the country. Responsibility for research lies with the
Department of Agriculture (DOA) and major emphasis is given to cereal devel-
opment programs. The major weaknesses in the research efforts are the almost
total absence of adaptive crop trials, particularly in Hill areas.
2.10      Traditionally, the Livestock Section of DOA has been primarily
concerned with livestock health; current staffing and training facilities
reflect this orientation although there is a strong awareness of the need to
strengthen livestock production extension services.
2.11      Agricultural Credit and Input Supply.  Prior to 1974, private money-
lenders predominated as the principal source of credit to the farming commu-
nity and lending from institutional sources provided only 20% of total farmer
requirements and reached about 18% of all farmers. The role of institutional
credit, however, was greatly enlarged under the Fifth Plan. Main responsibil-
ity for handling these needs was placed with the Agricultural Development
Bank, Nepal (ADBN). In 1974, Commercial Banks were also instructed to start
lending for agricultural development, but so far, the volume of lending is
small.



- 4 -
2.12      As the credit needs of small farmers were still not being met, in
early 1976, centrally managed cooperatives and village committees were reor-
ganized into the Sajha Cooperative Program (para 2.14). ADBN was given
responsibility for providing Sajha Managers and their training and assumed
a greater role in provision of credit to the program. Most short-term loans
are now disbursed through the Sajha movement whilst longer term loans are made
directly to beneficiaries. Lending operations of ADBN have increased substan-
tially from Rs 35.6 M in 1972/73 to Rs 198.0 M in 1976/77.
2.13      Inputs.  Farmers are usually faced with shortages and late delivery
of inputs because the Agricultural Inputs Corporation (AIC) has difficulties
with procurement, transportation and distribution, due to limited resources
and Nepal's landlocked position.
2.14      Cooperatives and Sajha.  Despite assistance from ADBN, the coopera-
tive movement did not grow rapidly. In order to reach more farmers, link
economic development with political decentralization at the grassroots level,
and mobilize local savings, HMG introduced the Sajha development program in
May 1976.  The goals of Sajha are to provide credit (both for production and
consumption), inputs, marketing facilities and to sell consumer goods (salt,
kerosene, coarse cloth, diesel oil, rice and sugar).
2.15      Marketing.  Different systems of marketing of agricultural products
exist in the Terai and the Hills.  In the Terai, where commerce is more highly
developed, the greatest percentage of trade is in the hands of itinerant
traders and agents (of millers and exporters).  In the Hills, however, which
lack traditional markets and where the constraint of accessibility exists,
traders are few, and the small and fortuitous agricultural surpluses are sold
directly by producers who carry them to the nearest market. In both the Terai
and Hills, agricultural marketing is further hampered by poor marketing
information, inadequate storage, and the lack of a standardized system of
measurement and grading.
2.16      Forestry.  Present forest area in Nepal is estimated at about 4.5
million ha. Given its accessibility, the sub-tropical Terai has been the prin-
cipal area of commercial exploitation and settlement. However, much of the
Hills forest has also been lost through settlement and over-exploitation for
fuel wood and animal fodder or green manure. In many areas, this denudation
has led to increased erosion. The Department of Forestry has not been able
to remedy the loss of forest stock, though some areas have been closed to
permit natural regeneration.
2.17      Cottage Industries.  Cottage industries represent an important
source of employment and incremental earnings in an economy dominated by small-
scale agriculture. Woolen goods (carpets, jackets, etc.), handloom products,
woven garments, forestry and fiber products, metal goods and food processing
are the main activities.
2.18      The Department of Cottage and Village Industries (DCVI) is respon-
sible for promotion, technical assistance and training. The Cottage Indus-
tries and Handicrafts Emporium Ltd., a public limited company functioning as
a subsidiary of DCVI, provides marketing assistance, bulk purchases raw



- 5 -
materials, offers resale services and handles the sales of spare parts and
equipment. ADBN and commercial banks provide credit to small and cottage
industries and a credit guarantee scheme is in operation.
2.19      Education.  In 1976/77, it was estimated that 59%, 14% and 10% of
the children of the relevant age groups were enrolled in primary, lower second-
ary, and upper secondary schools, respectively. The rapid expansion of educa-
tional facilities aggravated defects in the system: emphasis on theoretical
training; low female enrollment (an economic and cultural problem); a wide-
spread shortage of trained teachers; and few technical education institutions.
HMG has adopted the goal of 100% enrollment of primary school age children by
1987. Further, to encourage school enrollment, free textbooks are provided
for all primary school children in 25 designated "remote districts" and for
poor children (an estimated 15% of enrollment); and from 1978 all girls
receive free textbooks. In addition, teachers' salaries have been raised
and those working in remote areas will receive "hard living" allowances
(equivalent to 100% of base salary). HMG's education policy and programs
are implemented and supervised by the Ministry of Education (MOE), which
decentralizes responsibility to District education offices.
2.20      Health.  Improved basic health services are a necessity in Nepal
with its rapidly expanding population, high infant mortality rate, and
prevalence of major diseases. As in other sectors, however, Nepal is faced
with both manpower and budgetary constraints. The Fifth Five-Year Plan
(1975-80) expressed the goal as the "provision of minimum health services to
the maximum number of people." The approach adopted involves the creation of
rural health posts, providing minimal services, with the assistance of local
panchayats. Health posts are linked with district hospitals. The Ministry
of Health (MOH) is charged with overall responsibility for health programs and
institutions. At the district level this responsibility is delegated to
District Health Offices.
2.21      As part of efforts to improve the health of those living in rural
areas, HMG has made efforts to improve village water supplies. To accelerate
their development HMG initiated a program in 1970 with the assistance of
UNICEF and WHO. The Local Development Department of the Ministry of Home
Panchayat (MOHP) is responsible for implementation and provides technical
studies and financial support for schemes identified by district panchayats.
2.22      Postal Services.  Postal facilities in most rural areas are poorly
developed, with services such as provision of money and postal orders, saving
schemes and letter insurance being confined to the bigger towns. For those
living in rural areas, basic facilities can only be obtained at a series of
widely scattered sub-offices, located in rented buildings and operating on a
part-time basis. Collection and delivery of mail in these areas is by runner.
C. Administrative Organization
2.23      The political system of Nepal is based on the partyless Panchayat
system under the active leadership of His Majesty the King. Responsibility



- 6 -
for the running of day-to-day affairs is vested in the Cabinet. There are
sixteen ministries, most being represented at regional, zonal and district
level.
2.24      The Panchayat system which encompasses the political and develop-
mental organizations has three tiers. At the lowest level is the village
panchayat or for areas with a population of 10,000 and more, a town panchayat.
The next level is the district panchayat. At the highest level is the national
panchayat whose 125 members are elected by members of district panchayats.
2.25      Administratively, Nepal is divided into four Development Regions,
running from north to south and each comprising Mountain, Hill and Terai
areas. Each Development Region is sub-divided into Development Zones, varying
from 3 to 5 in number, which are further divided into Districts.
2.26      The working of the Panchayat system and assistance in local devel-
opment is the responsibility of the MOHP headed by a minister and responsible
to the National Panchayat. The Local Development Department (LDD) of the
Ministry is its executive arm, through which technical assistance and funds
are channeled to panchayats.
2.27      District and Village Panchayats.  MOHP undertakes training of
officials and elected members and provides staff and development funds. The
major responsibility for local development lies with village and district
panchayats. Village panchayat programs are initiated at village meetings
and submitted to the district panchayat for technical clearance and financial
assistance from grants which the LDD places at the disposal of district
panchayats for this purpose. Village panchayat projects are implemented
through local implementation committees composed of village panchayat chair-
men, district assembly members and voluntary workers. Technical supervision
is provided by district panchayat staff.
2.28      The responsibility for planning and implementation of district
panchayat development programs lies with the Secretariat of district panchayats
(para 2.30). After approval by the district assembly, development programs
are submitted to concerned departments for technical approval and provision
of funds. During implementation, projects are supervised by technical staff
of the appropriate department.
2.29      MOHP provides a multipurpose development worker to each village
panchayat and who also acts as secretary of the panchayat. Such workers not
only serve as a liaison between the district administration and village
panchayats, but also provide administrative support, especially in respect
of record keeping and accounting.
2.30      District Administration.  Under the District Administration Plan
(DAP), the Chief District Officer (CDO) is the administrative head of all
government functionaries of line ministries operating at the district level.
District officers of these line ministries are merged into a District Secre-
tariat, which also functions as the Secretariat to the district panchayat.
DAP defines two areas of responsibility of the CDO as maintenance of law and
order and district development. Execution of the latter function is entrusted
to a Panchayat Development Officer (PDO) under the CDO's supervision.



2.31      Line ministries retain technical supervision of staff at district
level whilst delegating administrative and financial responsibility to the
CDO for the preparation and implementation of district development plans.
Popular participation in development is established through coordination
committees, chaired by the district panchayat Chairman and comprising the CDO
and representatives of line ministries and district panchayat. The District
Secretariat is responsible for implementation of approved projects.
III. DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY AND RURAL DEVELOPMENT IN NEPAL
A. The Fifth Development Plan
3.01      In the initial period of development, Nepal had no alternative but
to commit most of its resources to the development of an economic infrastruc-
ture, and programs of this nature claimed the major portion of investment up
to the end of the Fourth Plan (1971-75).
3.02      The Fifth Plan (1975-1980), attempted to shift investment in favor
of quick-yielding growth promoting programs of development in agriculture,
industry, water resources and tourism. The development of agriculture was
of decisive importance and top priority within the sector was given to the
development of irrigation, including minor irrigation and groundwater proj-
ects. The Government also took measures to extend the use of inputs such as
fertilizer, insecticides and improved seeds. Emphasis was to be given to
afforestation and soil conservation. In hill areas, goals were to eliminate
the deficit in foodgrains production, followed by efforts to encourage horti-
culture and livestock development.
3.03      In the industrial sector, the Government proposed a two-pronged
strategy for cottage industries. The first, sought to develop cottage indus-
tries in the most promising growth areas in the Hills for sale in the rest
of the country or for export. The second, an approach toward self-reliance
in inaccessible areas, was aimed at catering to the needs of the local people
in those areas. The overall objective was to stimulate rural employment.
3.04      The strategy of developing growth-promoting sectors was to be comple-
mented by the development of social services by providing for such minimum
needs as basic health services, basic schooling and clean drinking water.
B. Rural Development
3.05      The Fifth Plan envisages that area based integrated development
programs will form the core of government policy for development of rural
areas. Earlier, the general approach had not been an integrated one and
efforts concentrated on one or, at best, a few facets of district development.
Most agencies had established autonomous project authorities which had gene-
rally operated through different ministries of government.



- 8 -
3.06      In early 1977, His Majesty's Government decided to formulate guide-
lines for implementation of future rural development projects and which would
be adopted by all international agencies agreeing to assist in the financing
of such projects. In light of experience gained during execution of the IDA
financed First Rural Development Project (Credit 617-NEP, para 3.10-3.12 and
Annex 1), HMG requested IDA assistance in formulating guidelines and these
were discussed with representatives of aid donors at a meeting held in
Kathmandu in mid-1977. The proposals emphasize participation of the people
in drawing up development plans and establish that implementation should be
carried out under the aegis of DAP (para 2.27-2.31), with coordination, at
central government level, by MOHP. Furthermore, it identifies priority areas
for development, training and technical assistance and indicates those compo-
nents which should normally be included in rural development projects. These
proposals have since formed the basis for project formulation and implementa-
tion.
3.07      There are now eight integrated rural development projects in various
stages of preparation/implementation (in contrast to five a year ago). They
involve development of some 30 Hill districts.
3.08      Under the draft Sixth Five Year Plan (1980-85) even greater technical
and managerial competence would be demanded of panchayats. The Plan proposes
that panchayats formulate village and district development projects covering
all sectors; that they arrange the proposed projects in order of priority;
assess financial, technical and managerial requirements for each project (inc-
luding the extent to which local resources -- financial and labor -- can be
mobilized); and continously monitor the progress of projects undertaken and
evaluate their success.
3.09      To reflect this enhanced role and to take account of an increasing
number of integrated rural development projects, HMG announced in early December
1978, a series of administrative and organizational changes which would enable
district and village panchayats to undertake increased responsibility for
development and which would improve coordination at all levels of Government
(para 7.01-7.09).
C. The First Rural Development Project (Credit 617-NEP)
3.10      This five year project became effective in July, 1976 and will
assist in the development of the two Hill districts of Nuwakot and Rasuwa
located in Central Region. Details of project content and cost are given
in Annex 1.
3.11      Project Progress.  General progress has been satisfactory.  With
some exceptions, implementation is either ahead of schedule or as forecast at
appraisal. Track and trail improvement has lagged owing to shortages of labor
during the construction season. Furthermore, shortages of well-trained staff
and lack of seed of improved varieties have contributed to a slow rate of
improvement in agricultural production. Nevertheless, considerable increases
in potato production have occurred at higher elevations and the establishment



of four small cheese/butter plants increased cash returns to livestock keeping.
As a result of recent staff changes at the regional level, the agricultural
program is now expected to gain momentum.
3.12      Despite frequent transfers and failure to fill a number of posts
(particularly in health and agriculture), district staff are now acquainted
with the project and display considerable keenness and initiative. Production
of the annual district development plan has insured local participation and
there is a marked increase in the confidence of local people toward the ability
of Government to implement programs. Interministerial coordination has been
good and the Project Coordinator effective in ensuring funding and providing
support for district staff. Reporting of progress has been satisfactory,
disbursement is 85% of estimates (the discrepancy being due to savings in
building costs and failure to meet expected development of tracks and trails)
but procurement has been cumbersome due to unfamiliarity with procedures.
Details of individual programs are given in Annex 1.
IV. THE PROJECT AREA
4.01      Location.  The project area covers the three administrative districts
of Darchula, Baitadi and Dandeldhura. These Hill districts, together with
Kanchanpur District (located in the Terai) comprise Mahakali Zone and situated
in the extreme west of the Far-Western Development Region. (Map IBRD 14189).
The project area is bordered by China to the north, India to the west and by
the districts of Bajhang and Doti in the east and Kanchanpur in the south.
The three Mainakali Hill districts cover some 5,300 sq. km, and comprise
94 village panchayat areas.
A. Agricultural and Livestock Production
4.02      Agricultural Production.  The information contained in this section
is based on pilot studies, data collected during project preparation, general
discussions with district staff and farmers, and direct observations made by
the appraisal mission.
4.03      Land Use.  The total area of project districts is some 530,500 ha,
of which 54,900 ha (10%) are under cultivation. Present estimated land use is:

4.05      Climate.  Project districts, which can be classified into five
climatic belts, range in altitude from 250 m to 7,000 meters a.s.l. The
climate, strongly influenced by the Himalayan mountain range, varies from
subtropical to arctic, with crop production and livestock raising practiced
below 2,400 meters a.s.l.
4.06      Rainfall.  Rainfall is monsoonal with about 80% of the average rain-
fall of 1,500 mm falling in the months of June, July, August and September.
The remaining 20% is accounted for by the retreating monsoon and by late
winter and summer rains.

4.07      Dry season rainfall is both low and unreliable.  Successful crop
production on soils of low moisture retention capacity is uncertain at this
time of year and hence farmers have made considerable efforts to develop
irrigation systems.
4.08      Geology.  The geology of the area is typical of the central
Himalayan region with weathered and folded phyllites, schists, slates and
dolmites commonly encountered.  Quartzite and dolomitic limestone horizons
are often crushed and fractured indicating fault zones.  These areas are most
prone to landslide occurrence.
4.09      Topography and Soils.  Reasonably flat land adjacent to rivers and
streams accounts for only 7,500 ha or less than 2% of the total area. All
cultivated land has been levelled or terraced to some extent, and this includes
areas of hill slopes as steep as 45 degrees. With inherently shallow, medium-
textured soils, constant cultivation of these upland slopes contributes to
erosion.
4.10      Red lateritic soils, derived from phyllite, predominate.  In
general, these well-drained soils can be rated slightly acidic to slightly
alkaline in reaction, medium in organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus con-
tent and high in potash.

4.11      Size of Holdings.  Detailed surveys of holding size have not been
conducted and available data is based on a series of sample surveys. It is
estimated that size and number of landholdings indicate that less than half
a hectare of land is farmed by 40% of all farmers in Darchula district, 80%
of farmers in Baitadi district and 70% of farmers in Dandeldhura district.
Holdings comprise between 5-7 fragments.

4.12      Cropping Pattern and Area under Crops.  Four distinct cropping
systems are practiced throughout project districts depending on availability
of irrigation, topography and altitude. Details are given in Annex 2,
together with crop information. Paddy, wheat, barley, maize and millet
constitute the main crops with potatoes grown at higher altitudes.
4.13      Crop Yields.  Crop yields are generally low, even under irrigated
conditions.  Present average yields are shown below:
Crop          Average Yield per Ha
(MT)
Paddy /a                  1.30
Maize                     1.00
Millets                   0.75
Wheat                     0.80
Barley                    0.55
Potato                    3.70
/a Ranges from 0.6 tons/ha for upland
paddy to 1.7 tons for lowland irri-
gated paddy.
4.14      Pests and Diseases.  Paddy and maize crops are attacked by a number
of pests and diseases. The main insect pests of paddy are stem borers, rice
bug and grasshopper; maize is highly susceptible to stem borer attack. Among
diseases, "blast" and "leaf blight" of paddy are common. Aphids-and termites
also cause considerable damage. Little care is given to seed storage. Gene-
rally no pest or disease control is practiced by farmers.
4.15      Manures and Fertilizers.  Most farmers use only organic manures, but
little attempt is made to prepare good, well rotted manure and all material



- 12 -
is left in uncovered heaps. Use of fertilizers is negligible, with total
sales throughout the project area being 30 MT in 1976-77.
4.16      Seed.  Little improved seed of main crops grown has been supplied
to project districts by AIC. Due to distance from Kathmandu and lack of
communications, the cost of improved seed is high. Poor on-farm storage
arrangements and constant use of the same seed lead to the quality of
farmers' seed being low. In most areas, farmers are unaware of improved
varieties of paddy, maize and wheat.
4.17      Horticultural Crops.  A range of tropical, subtropical and temperate
fruits and vegetables are cultivated throughout project districts and confined
to backyard gardens for home consumption. The total area under fruit and
vegetables is about 500 ha and 200 ha respectively. Mango, banana, guava and
papaya are the common tropical fruits with citrus species growing at altitudes
of 1,500 meters a.s.l. Temperate fruits are pear, peach and apricot and apple
has recently been introduced to Baitadi district. Local varieties of walnut,
often growing wild, are found above altitudes of 1,500 meters a.s.l. There
is a government horticultural farm located at Satbanj in Baitadi district and
covering an area of about 7 ha. This farm carries out varietal trials, serves
as a demonstration orchard and trains farmers. Lack of funds has, however,
restricted farm development and as a result, supply of fruit trees is limited.
Apple, peach, plum and walnuts are propagated on the station.
4.18      Agricultural Extension and Research.  Present authorized staffing
levels are limited with many posts vacant due to lack of housing, incentives
and development funds.

4.19      Against a sanctioned strength of 28 JTA, 19 posts are currently
vacant and of 12 JT, 2 posts are unfilled. JTA are the main extension
link with farmers but vacancies and lack of a systematic program of training
have resulted in a weak extension organization. Contact with farmers is
little, resulting in a low level of awareness. Furthermore, there is no
research activity and recommendations for improved practices are based on work
carried out elsewhere. In addition, there is no program of adaptive trials.
4.20      Livestock Production.  Buffalo, cattle and goat are common throughout
all districts with sheep, yak, and chauries (cross between yak and cow) confined
to higher areas of Darchula district. Information on livestock numbers is
based on local surveys:

4.21      The average number of animals per household is about 7.50, the
breakdown between districts being:

Total              8.8         6.5            7.3
4.22      Husbandry Systems.  Buffaloes are kept for milk and manure and
usually stallfed on cut grass, crop residues and fodder tree leaves.  Milk,
surplus to domestic requirements, is converted into ghee and sold to local
exporters. Cattle are maintained primarily for draught purposes and receive
little additional feed, having to rely on natural grazing. Milk yields are
low. Sheep and goats, in flocks of 100-200 animals and yaks are used for
transportation as well as for wool and meat. Chaurie are also used as pack
animals.
4.23      Animal Health Situation and Facilities.  Very little information
is available as to the animal disease position. There are only four animal
health posts in project districts - a checkpost at Darchula, two dispensaries
in Baitadi district and one at Dandeldhura. A veterinary hospital is located
at Patan in Baitadi district.
4.24      Rinderpest is now largely controlled through vaccination.  Incidence
of liver fluke is high and causes mortality in sheep and goats of about 20%.
Foot and mouth disease is common, causing heavy production losses, especially
in bovines. Hemorrhagic septicemia is endemic among buffaloes.
4.25      Veterinary facilities are poor, with existing health posts ill-
equipped and lacking drugs. There is also no program for upgrading the
quality of village livestock. Shortage of winter feed is a constraint to
improved production. It is estimated that only 30% of feed requirements come
from grazing, whereas, 15% is produced from cut grass or hay, 25% from fodder



- 14 -
trees and 25% from crop residues and home grown concentrates (including
kitchen waste). Grazing is confined to common land which is deteriorating.
Among crop residues paddy straw, rice, wheat and maize bran and legumes are
commonly fed. Wheat and barley straw and maize stover are not fed to animals.
4.26      Livestock products consist of meat, milk, ghee, hides and skins,
wool and manure. Annual total meat production is estimated at about 600 MT,
of which 30% is home consumed and the rest sold locally. Sheep, goat and
poultry contribute almost entirely to this production. Surplus milk is con-
verted into ghee and production is estimated at about 200 MT in Darchula
district, 800 MT in Baitadi district and 300 MT in Dandeldhura district.
The quality of sheep wool is coarse, with production of 1 kg per sheep per
year. Shearing is done twice yearly and production is about 14,000 kg mainly
from Darchula district. Most livestock products, especially ghee, are sold
through middlemen, with the main marketing centers at Dharmaghat, Thoobeghat
(Baitadi); Joljibi, Dhap, Kalanga (Darchula); Mahendranagar (Kanchanpur) and
Dhangadi.
B. Forest and Water Resources
4.27      Forest Resources:  Some 60% (3,300 sq km) of the project area is
under forest, ranging from sub-tropical Sal forest at altitudes below 800
meters a.s.l. through Chirpine and Oak forest in the altitude range 800 to
2,400 meters a.s.l. to alpine forests (containing Blue Pine, Fir and Rhodo-
dendron) at elevations above 2,400 m. No data has been collected defining
the amounts of commercial species and volumes of timber available for exploit-
ation.
4.28      Despite the fact that all forest land is nominally owned by gov-
ernment, continuing and uncontrolled felling occurs. In the absence of
sufficient government staff to control exploitation coupled with failure to
complete cadastral surveys defining forest limits and ever increasing demands
for arable land, forest areas now face an accelerating rate of destruction.
4.29      The three project districts fall under the administrative jurisdic-
tion of the Seti-Mahakali Forest Circle. Baitadi and Darchula districts form
the Mahakali Forest Division, with headquarters at Baitadi, whereas Dandeldhura
district operates as a separate Division with headquarters at Dandeldhura.
4.30      Erosion.  In the project area erosion is less critical as easy
access to India enables people to either emigrate permanently or supplement
their incomes through seasonal employment. In addition, there are signi-
ficantly lower pressures on land than exist elsewhere in Nepal. Consequently,
much of the forest cover is intact.
4.31      Water Resources.  Few hydrological records exist for the rivers and
streams flowing in the project area. Only one gauging station is in opera-
tion at Patan and some nine years of records are available from this station.



- 15 -
In general terms, water availability is a major constraint to development and
improvement of hill terrace irrigation, particularly in higher areas away
from valley bottoms. Water supplies in most streams are limited in the latter
part of the dry season (from February to May) and this severely limits the
area which can be developed for irrigated winter cropping or early paddy
production.
4.32      Inspection of rivers and streams indicates that heavy bed and sus-
pended sediment loads are carried during the flood season. No quantitative
estimates are available. These loads, however, certainly influence annual
maintenance requirements of all river diversions and canals, even though water
requirements, during the peak flow season, are only of a supplementary nature.
During the dry season, irrigation water will have a negligible sediment
content.
4.33      Present Irrigation.  About 3,200 ha in the project area is presently
irrigated from locally constructed schemes which divert water from rivers,
streams and springs. Water is diverted using simply-constructed diversions
which are generally damaged or destroyed during each flood season. Springs
provide limited irrigation for upper hill terraces but as these are also used
for domestic supplies, they tend to dry out early in the winter. In most
cases, little or no water control is practiced. However, in many situations,
considerable ingenuity has been demonstrated in the use of local building
materials for construction of canals and canal structures, particularly when
associated with water-powered flour mills. Timber, slate and dry stone masonry
are frequently used for cross drainage structures, canal control and outlets.
4.34      No formal irrigation schemes have been constructed in the project
area and all existing schemes are either farmers' own schemes or those devel-
oped through panchayat assistance. Maintenance of existing schemes is carried
out by farmers themselves, both on their own schemes and those partially
financed through the panchayat organization. In some areas, farmers have
created an informal organization which, through levies on those farmers
benefiting from the irrigation, is able to hire regular maintenance workers.
Farmer contributions for such work is either in kind or cash.
C. Communications
4.35      Compared with most hill areas of Nepal, the three districts compris-
ing the project area are fortunate in that they not only have foot access to
and from India at two recognized border crossings, but also are connected by
a dry season road which recently reached the district headquarters of
Dandeldhura from the western Terai at Dhangadi.
4.36      At present, some 500 km of trails interconnect villages and admin-
istrative centers. In the past, these have been constructed and maintained
by village panchayats with little assistance provided by government. Apart
from the on-going roadwork between Dandeldhura and Baitadi, there is no
vehicular access beyond the district headquarters of Dandeldhura. HMG



- 16 -
is undertaking, with the assistance of the World Food Program, the construc-
tion of a mule track from the Indian border-crossing at Jhulaghat via Darchula
to Tinker Pass on the Tibet border - a distance of some 240 km. Work started
in January, 1977 and by late 1978, some 88 km of track had been completed at
a cost of Rs 1.5 million.
4.37      A few suspension bridges and wooden bridges already exist on some
main trails, but generally river crossings consist of temporary structures
liable to flood damage during the rain season. Consequently, many areas are
isolated during the monsoon, necessitating long, difficult diversions.
D. Supporting Services
4.38      Agricultural Inputs.  The Agriculture Inputs Corporation (AIC) sup-
plies seed, fertilizer, pesticides and implements through a rented sales depot
located in each district. Inputs are distributed to cooperatives and private
dealers from these depots. In the absence of any organized program, the supply
of seed to farmers is erratic and available only in small quantities.
4.39      Fertilizer is transported by truck to Dandeldhura, Jhulaghat and
Darchula and thence by porters and mules. The present amount of inputs dis-
tributed by AIC in project districts is as under:
1976-77
District        Fertilizer    Seed    Pesticides    Implements
tons         tons     Rs '000          Rs '000
Darchula            3.05         0.87        0.83           2.26
Baitadi            23.24         1.31        2.68           7.05
Dandeldhura         4.41         2.95        1.58           1.25
30.70        5.13        5.09          10.56
4.40      The main constraint to an effective input supply program is that
AIC lacks adequate storage. Furthermore, there are no storage facilities away
from district depots and farmers have to purchase inputs at either main depots
or at the few cooperatives.
4.41      Agricultural Credit.  The Agricultural Development Bank (ADBN) is
responsible for providing agricultural credit through two branch offices, one
at Baitadi and the other at Dandeldhura. It also maintains a small office
at Darchula. The volume of business is small, with high amounts of loans
outstanding, particularly medium-term loans. Present staffing provides in
each district for one Depot/Branch Manager and three to four clerks. Loans are
presently being made to about 300 farmers and one cooperative society in
Baitadi district and 220 farmers and 3 cooperatives in Dandeldhura District.
No loans have been made in Darchula District.



- 17 -
4.42      Cooperative Societies (Sajha).  There are four cooperatives operat-
ing in the project area--one at Baitadi and three in Dandeldhura district
located at Dandeldhura, Dhawdi and Joghbura with a total membership of 739.
There is no society as yet in Darchula district. The Baitadi society maintains
three small storage depots located at Hat, Bagkhot and Liskela. Cooperatives
advance loans to members for purchase of inputs and livestock, horticultural
development, and for consumption needs. Loan recovery is generally poor and
most defaulters are those who borrowed medium-term loans for horticultural
development and purchase of livestock and implements. Each cooperative is
staffed by a manager and operates from offices and godowns located in rented
buildings. There is a District Cooperative Office at Baitadi and Dandeldhura
headed by an Auditor assisted by one Inspector and three subinspectors. This
organization audits accounts twice yearly and arranges training of cooperative
staff and farmers. Whilst audit is up-to-date, no efforts have been made to
organize training.
4.43      District Administration.  Since 1975, none of the districts in the
project area have prepared district plans and such plans as exist are prepared
by line departments and funded through the normal procedures of HMG. The main
reasons for this are a shortage of government funds and staff in all sectors,
lack of capability at district level in plan formulation; minimal participation
by the people, and a general distrust of elected officials who are often drawn
from the social and economic elite of the villages.
4.44      Education.  There are now some 430 schools - 310 primary, 105 lower
secondary and 15 secondary - with a total of about 28,000 students and 1,000
teachers. Attendance figures do not reflect variations in numbers of boys
and girls enrolling in each district. In addition, the number of trained
teachers is low. At the primary level, the percentage of untrained teachers
is 57, 63 and 88 in Darchula, Baitadi and Dandeldhura districts respectively.
The physical condition of most schools is poor: some lack roofs; a signifi-
cant percentage have unfinished dirt floors and no windows; classrooms have
makeshift partitions. Secondary schools are few in number and dispersed.
Students wishing to obtain a secondary education, often have to walk several
miles each day to attend school and thus enrollment is concentrated among
students living in nearby villages. Attempts have been made to encourage
students to enroll through the construction of hostels. These attempts have
not, however, been entirely successful largely because hostel facilities are
poor (inadequate living and poor dining facilities and lack of sanitation
are the main reasons). Most schools also lack basic teaching equipment and
aids (chalk, blackboards, a desk and cupboard for the teacher, and science
equipment). In addition, there is a lack of teacher accommodation.
4.45      Health Services.  Numerous interrelated factors are responsible
for poor levels of health in the project area: lack of safe drinking water
supplies, low level of basic health services, sub-subsistence agricultural
production and inadequate education in matters of hygiene. It is evident,
however, that the main diseases to which the population are prone are common
to all hill areas of Nepal. Infant mortality is reported to be high.



- 18 -
4.46      Health services presently are organized along lines formulated by
government. At the district level there is a small, 15 bed district hospital,
district health office and a number of health posts, each serving four to five
village panchayats. Presently, only two districts (Baitadi and Dandeldhura)
have hospitals and health offices but the hospital in Dandeldhura has no
in-patient accommodation. There are 23 health posts scattered throughout the
three districts of which only one is in non-rented accommodation. In addition,
health services suffer from shortages of staff, staff housing and regular and
adequate supplies of drugs.
4.47      Postal Services.  A District Post Office located at district head-
quarters is responsible for providing supervision of outlying offices. The
office at Baitadi, besides offering full postal services, provides for savings
and handles money orders, whilst that at Dandeldhura issues and cashes money
orders but offers no facilities for savings. The office at Darchula provides
for postage only. All offices operate in rented accommodation, lack furniture
and fittings, often necessitating mail to be sorted on the dirt floor. Scat-
tered throughout each district are 43 sub-post offices and which provide
minimal services. Mail travels to and from and throughout the project area
by a series of runners who cover some 10-15 miles before handing the mail on
to the next runner. There are no official relay stations.
4.48      Cottage Industries.  Little detailed information is available con-
cerning cottage industries, but at present, 198 small industries (generally
involving less than Rs 500 of capital investment) are registered throughout
the project area. Production of woolen goods predominates, with cotton weav-
ing, woodwork, beekeeping and metal work making up the balance.
4.49      Except for wool-based industries (largely carpet weaving) which
are mainly concentrated in Darchula district, other enterprises are widely
dispersed throughout the three districts. Most products are consumed locally
with the little marketable surplus, mostly woolen goods, exported to India.
Staff shortages within the Department of Cottage and Village Industries
lead to the absence of extension and training.
E. Socioeconomic Background
4.50      The population, an estimated 333,000 in 1978, is divided into some
53,500 households, living in villages and administratively grouped together
into 94 panchayats each with an average population of 3,500. The village
population is stratified into castes which rigidly prescribe the occupations
which can be undertaken. Changes have, however, taken place but there is,
generally, a coincidence between the social and economic elite. For most,
agriculture is the main occupation. Supplementary sources of income are
livestock, labor in the fields of others, porterage, cottage industries, and
construction. It is estimated that other employment contributes 30%, 24% and
35% of secondary sources of income in Darchula, Baitadi, and Dandeldhura

4.51      Food Consumption.  Cereals and potatoes constitute about 85% of the
average diet, the balance is obtained through the consumption of pulses, vege-
tables and animal products (meat is rarely consumed). A food balance sheet
(Annex 2, Tables 1-4) prepared for each project district shows that only
Dandeldhura district could support its population in 1976-77 at little more
than minimum subsistence level. None of the districts, however, produced
enough food to support their populations at average subsistence levels. The
situation in 1977 was as follows:
Average Number of Days for Which Homegrown Food Suffices
Average Subsistence /a Minimum Subsistence /b
Darchula              200                       233
Baitadi               250                       300
Dandeldhura           340                       412
/a Calculated at 2,500 calories per Adult Consumption Unit
(ACU) per day for Baitadi and Dandeldhura and 2,700 for
Darchula.
/b Calculated at 2,000 calories per ACU per day for Baitadi
and Dandeldhura and 2,200 for Darchula.
4.52      An attempt has recently been made to determine average expenditures
per farm household, the components of the household budget, and the average
income needs based on minimum nutritional levels. 1/ On the basis of the cost
of food sufficient to provide a minimum subsistence of 2,256 calories per day
per person and the lowest cost of other necessary items, it was further esti-
mated that in the Far Western Region (of which the project area forms part),
59.2% of households and 51.8% of the population (approx. 1.4 million) were
below the poverty line. The figures are too high since they are based on a
caloric intake per person, not per adult consumption unit, but, however,
indicate the general poverty prevailing in the project area. Furthermore,
a significant percentage of the population lives at a high level of indebted-
ness. Past surveys in this regard indicate that 34%, 26% and 60% of the
households in Darchula, Baitadi and Dandeldhura districts, respectively, were
in debt. The main sources of credit are traders, wealthier patrons and local
moneylenders.
4.53      Migration and Labor Surplus.  Other sources of income and employment
are limited and a significant percentage of the population continue to move
out of the area in the off-season (mainly between November and April) to try
and supplement incomes. As shops and employment are not to be found easily,
the movement is to the Terai (Kanchanpur District) and across the Mahakali
river into India. Migration takes two forms, either permanent or seasonal.
Permanent migrants form a small percentage but have increased over the past

tribution and consumption patterns in Nepal (preliminary). Kathmandu,

decades, rising to 14.3% of the population in 1976. 1/ Seasonal migrations
account for a greater percentage and estimates vary from 40% to 10% of the
adult male population. From studies, it is obvious that the reasons for
migration are complex and not necessarily work-related, although the need
for employment is the major reason.
4.54      A question of significance for the project is whether migrants
would stay in their villages during the off-season if sufficient employment
opportunities existed within the project area. Nearly 78% of migrants sur-
veyed stated that they would. It is estimated that during the period from
November to April, labor available for construction work would be some
18,000 persons.
V. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
5.01      The five year project would help develop the three hill districts
of Dandeldhura, Baitadi and Darchula in which 53,300 families reside. The
principal aim of the project would be to raise agricultural production to
levels whereby farmers could meet full family subsistence. The project
comprises:
(a) Improvements to agricultural production through provision
of agricultural extension, farmer and staff training, wider
use of seed of improved varieties, and adoption of better
husbandry practices. Availability of inputs would be
increased through establishment of cooperatives, provision
of small warehouses and credit. Services to farmers would
be centered at a number of administrative service centers
located throughout the project area;
(b) Livestock development through improved animal health
services and upgrading of buffalo;
(c) Development and improvement of hill and river terrace
irrigation;
(d) Establishment of anti-erosion measures to protect roads
and other infrastructure either developed or improved
under the project;
(e) Improved health care through construction of district
hospitals and health posts and provision of staff,
equipment, drugs and medicines;
(f) Upgrading of facilities at lower and upper secondary
schools, construction of student hostel accommodation
and provision of teaching aids and staff;
1/   See NPC and CEDA.  Migration in Nepal.  Kathmandu, 1977.



- 21 -
(g)  Development of panchayat facilities through construction
of community and recreation centers, and village water
supplies; improvement of shallow wells, and provision of
training;
(h)  Improvement of communications through upgrading of exist-
ing trails and construction of footbridges;
(i)  Development and improvement of postal services and cottage
industries; and
(j)  Construction of buildings and housing and provision of
staff, equipment and vehicles necessary for project
implementat ion.
B. Detailed Features
1.   Agricultural Development
5.02      The project area is remote, has poor communications and income
levels are such that farmers are in no financial position to invest in costly
agricultural inputs. The project therefore emphasizes the adoption of low
cost measures for raising productivity. To implement these proposals, the
project would:
(a)  Develop district level schemes for overcoming distri-
butional problems presently constraining the wider use
of seed of improved varieties;
(b)  Upgrade infrastructure to facilitate farmers' access to
agricultural credit and inputs, especially for irrigated
land;
(c)  Encourage greater planting of vegetable and fruit crops in
order to improve diets; and
(d)  Upgrade the ability of the agricultural extension service
to advise farmers on low cost measures for raising agri-
cultural production.
5.03      Crop Seed Improvement.  Substantial improvements in production
are possible through wider use of seed of improved crop varieties. At
present, there is no organized program for seed production or distribution,
and farmers plant seed which has not been replaced for a long time, has low
viability, is full of impurities and of poor genetic potential. Under the
project, emphasis would be given to replacing existing seed, but as this
would take time, initial efforts would be directed to encouraging farmers
to improve seed storage and to clean and grade their own seed before sowing.
To this end, each service center (para 5.12), would have a small hand win-
nower which could be used by farmers wishing to clean seed. Simultaneously,



- 22 -
a seed exchange and multiplication program would be introduced so that at the
end of the project period about 40% of the cultivated area would be planted to
improved varieties. Responsibility for providing a supply of good seed would
lie with AIC.
5.04      Each season, small packets of seed sufficient to plant one ropani
of land (1 ha = 20 ropani) would be distributed to selected farmers in each
village in exchange for an equivalent amount of their own seed. This seed
would be dressed and packaged with instructions of recommended practices
and would cover the paddy, wheat, maize and potato crops. Farmers would
gradually bulk this seed until they had replaced existing varieties with
improved varieties.
5.05      The success of such a seed multiplication program depends on the
availability of improved varieties suited to the different ecological con-
ditions found throughout the project area. Crop research or comprehensive
variety trials have not been carried out. However, DOA has planted a number
of field demonstrations on farmers' fields and have obtained some information
concerning the performance of recommended varieties in the project area.
This information indicates that two paddy varieties--IR24 and Chainung 242--
have successfully outyielded existing varieties. New maize varieties have
been tested throughout the Hill areas of Nepal and those recommended for
project districts are two composite varieties--Khumaltar Yellow and Rampur
Yellow. In Baitadi and Dandeldhura districts, these varieties mature in 120
days, whereas local varieties require only 90-100 days. In view of this
difference, introduction of the new varieties has been slow, but as their
yield potential is more than double that of present varieties, it should be
possible to increase the area cropped. Most wheat research has been carried
out in the Terai, but three varieties have been planted in Hill regions. Of
these, two are high yielding--Lerma 64 and RR 21. A third variety, NL 30, has
also shown promise, particularly under rainfed conditions. Suitable Indian
potato varieties are available, but have only been tried out in Darchula
district on a limited, but nevertheless successful, scale. Seed is plentiful
and could be obtained from the neighboring state of Uttar Pradesh. In order
to carry out the seed exchange program and the seed multiplication scheme,
existing staff and facilities of AIC would be strengthened. Estimates of
annual seed requirements, details of cost and staff required, are given in
Annex 7, Table 3.
5.06      Agricultural Credit and Input Storage.  In the fourth and fifth
project years, it is anticipated that farmers would start to benefit from
the effects of the seed exchange program, an improved agricultural extension
service and the irrigation development program. It is likely, therefore, that
there would be an increased demand for production credit. To satisfy these
needs the project would provide incremental short-term credit sufficient to
cover the needs of seed replacement and to meet the fertilizer and plant
protection requirements of all irrigated land in the project area. It would
also provide staff and facilities for ADBN to enable them to carry out the
credit program. The project would strengthen district cooperative offices



- 23 -
to enable supervision of all cooperatives and provide training to members.
The project would also provide staff and warehouse facilities (3 district
stores of 200 MT capacity and 22 cooperative stores of 20 MT capacity) for
AIC. Details are in Annex 7, Table 3.
5.07      Agricultural Development Bank.  At district level the project would
provide for the construction of a small office with furniture and equipment to
supplement existing facilities. No additional staff would be required to carry
out the credit program. Details of credit are given in Annex 7, Table 3.
5.08      Sajha Cooperatives.  Over the project period, 22 cooperatives would
be established and located at proposed service centerss. Each society would
be provided with a small office, a 20 MT warehouse and a manager (provided by
ADBN) and storeman. Details are given in Annex 7, Table 3.
5.09      Cooperative Department.  One office in each district would be con-
structed, equipped and staffed to ensure timely audit and supervision of
societies to be established under the project. Funds would also be provided
to ensure the training of about 500 members annually and 22 managers of
societies. Details are given in Annex 7, Table 3.
5.10      Horticultural Development.  The project area has potential for
horticultural development. As part of general efforts to increase food produc-
tion, the facilities at the horticultural farm at Satbanj (Baitadi district)
would be expanded to supply fruit trees and vegetable seed to farmers in all
project districts. The number of farmers covered under the program would total
4,000 in Darchula and 8,000 each in Baitadi and Dandeldhura districts.  Efforts
would be made to encourage farmers to plant a fruit garden of some 160 square
meters.  In addition, vegetable seed would be supplied to 3,600 farmers in
Darchula district and 4,600 each in Baitadi and Dandeldhura districts. As the
Satbanj horticultural station would supply the increased needs of fruit trees
and vegetable seed, the project provides for the incremental cost of operating
the station and for purchase of equipment and furniture and construction of
staff quarters. Details are given in Annex 7, Table 4.
5.11      Agricultural Extension Services.  As farmers lack the financial
resources to invest in costly inputs, the project would stress the widespread
adoption of low cost measures for raising agricultural production. Major
emphasis would be placed on improved agronomic practices, including correct
spacing, better placement of farmyard manure, control of insect pests and
improved seed storage. Attention would be paid to improved methods of pro-
ducing farmyard manure. Despite the fact that no research work has been
carried out, universally applicable good farming principles are known that
would bring about substantial improvements in yield. In order to carry out
these proposals, the project would strengthen and expand the agricultural
extension service, both at district and panchayat level. This would be
brought about by the construction of 22 small administrative service centers
and offices located at district headquarters. For location see Map IBRD 14189.

5.12      Service Centers.  Each center would, on average, cover 4-5 panchayats
and be located with regard to concentrations of population and present farming
activity. Each center, constructed from locally available materials, would
comprise a small office building for use by extension and other visiting
government staff. Office and training equipment and staff quarters would
also be provided. Also located at service centers would be a small livestock
dispensary (para 5.19), Sajha Office and store (para 5.08), post office (para
5.62) and community hall and resthouse (para 5.39). Location and phasing of
centers are shown below:

District Level Organization
5.13      A District Agricultural Development Officer (DADO) would be in charge
of each district, assisted by an Assistant District Agricultural Development
Officer (Asst. DADO), one Junior Technician (JT), two Junior Technical Assist-
ants (JTA) and clerical staff. The Asst. DADO would be primarily responsible
for liaison with AIC and for the seed development program. Facilities would
be developed at district headquarters and would include an office building
containing an information hall, where presently lacking, staff quarters and
office and training equipment. Each service center would be headed by a JT,
assisted by one JTA for every two panchayats and 3 Village Agricultural
Assistants (VAA) for each panchayat. Other staff would consist of one store-
man and a messenger. Total staff needs of the project are given below and
would be phased over a four-year period.

5.14      Extension Methodology.  VAA would operate part-time at panchayat
level and would be farmers actually engaged in working of their land. VAA
would be selected for their progressive outlook, leadership qualities and
willingness to serve the community. VAA would be given regular training at
frequent intervals within the project area (para 5.15) and would be organized
so that they are able to meet farmers frequently and according to a scheduled
program. JT and JTA would also prepare their tour schedules in such a manner
as to be able to meet VAA frequently in the field. Each VAA would be expected
to carry out five simple demonstrations each year.
5.15      Training.  In order to provide farmers with timely advice, a specific
schedule of visits by extension staff would be prepared by each DADO. All
staff would undergo periodic training as shown below:

5.16      To assist in developing training programs, a Training and Communi-
cations Officer would be appointed (para 7.11) and would operate from project
headquarters at Patan where a small training center would be constructed.
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that detailed training proposals
would be submitted to IDA for comment within twelve months of credit

effectiveness. DADO and JT would be responsible for training of JTA and VAA
and would be assisted by an Agronomist based at Project headquarters (para
7.11) who would also assist in drawing up programs.
5.17      In order to carry out the extension program, the project would pro-
vide buildings, staff quarters, office and training equipment and staff for
both district and service center levels. Details are given in Annex 7,
Table 2.
2.   Livestock Development
5.18      Among constraints to livestock production are adequate veterinary
health coverage, advice to farmers on health care and feeding of animals
and programs to improve the genetic quality of farm animals. To help improve
animal health, the project would construct, staff and equip a small veterinary
dispensary at each service center (para 5.12) to provide assistance to farmers
with sick animals and to initiate programs for inoculation and dosing of live-
stock. Emphasis would be placed on immunizing buffalo and cattle against
rinderpest and hemorrhagic septicemia and sheep and goats against enterotoxemia.
Anthelmics would be provided for treatment of internal parasites in domestic
stock. Drugs and equipment would also be made available for dosing sheep
and goats against liver fluke and lung worm. Advice on improved livestock
husbandry practices would be provided by a district level extension unit
operating through dispensaries. Subjects to be covered would include feeding
of livestock and overall improvement of animal health.
5.19      Veterinary Dispensaries.  Under the project, 21 veterinary dispens-
aries located at service centers would be built and equipped -- 6 in Darchula
district, 8 in Baitadi district and 7 in Dandeldhura district. Construction
would be phased at the same rate as that of service centers (para 5.12). Each
dispensary would be staffed by 2 JTA and 2 stockmen and adequate supplies of
vaccines, drugs and medicine provided, The existing veterinary hospital at
Patan would serve as an additional center in Baitadi district besides acting
as headquarters for a Veterinary Surgeon and who would provide technical
guidance to dispensaries. This hospital would be strengthened to include the
renovation of existing buildings, provision of fencing, furniture, equipment
and staff. To provide assistance to dispensaries in carrying out annual
inoculations and dosing of livestock and to help contain sudden outbreaks
of disease, two teams of inoculators would be stationed at the Veterinary
hospital, under the control of the Veterinary Surgeon. Each team would
consist of one JT, two JTA and one stockman. Over the project period, it
is anticipated that some 126,000 head of livestock would be inoculated.
5.20      To help control ectoparasites of sheep and goats which are prevalent
throughout the project area, three dipping tanks would be constructed at Shera
in Baitadi district and Dhulinga and Khanangea in Darchula district. These
locations form the main entry points for flocks during seasonal migrations of
animals into these districts. Dipping would be carried out twice yearly under
the direction of the veterinary surgeon.
5.21      Located at each veterinary dispensary would be one buffalo bull
(Murrah breed) which would be available to farmers for upgrading the quality



- 27 -
of their animals. To ensure rotation of stud bulls and to provide replace-
ments in the case of death or sickness, eight buffalo bulls would be kept at
the Veterinary Hospital at Patan. Housing for buffalo bulls would be included
in building costs of each dispensary. Accommodation for bulls already exists
at Patan. Details of cost are given in Annex 7, Table 5.
5.22      District Level Extension.  At district level, an organization would
be established to carry out a livestock extension program. An Assistant Live-
stock Officer would be in charge, assisted by one JT, one JTA and supported
by a clerk and a stockman. The district office would be located in the same
building as DADO. Staff quarters would be provided. Operating through dis-
pensaries, this organization would provide training of JT and JTA at refresher
courses held at regular intervals and would organize field days for farmers at
which emphasis would be placed on increased use of crop residues for livestock
feeding. Assistance in developing training courses would be given by the
Training and Communications Officer, the Agronomist and Livestock Officer
(para 7.11). Staff required to carry out the livestock development program
is given below:

5.23      Marketing of Livestock Products.  Ghee is the main livestock product
of the project area. Little is known, however, about returns to producers,
marketing channels and overall quality. Under the project, funds would be
provided to the Dairy Development Corporation (DDC) to carry out a study to
determine improvements to marketing and production of ghee and to initiate
a pilot program to implement recommendations arising out of the study. Assur-
ances were obtained that DDC would undertake the study within twelve months
of credit effectiveness.
3.   Irrigation Development
5.24      One of the greatest needs of farmers in the project area is for
improved irrigation facilities, to help ensure that existing works are not
repeatedly destroyed during the rainy season, to provide year-round irrigation
to areas currently only supplied during the rains, and to build new diversions
to supply presently non-irrigated areas.
5.30      Irrigation Potential.  With the assistance of government officers
and panchayat leaders, some 22 irrigation schemes were identified during
project preparation. The net command area of these schemes, by district,
is given below:



- 28 -
District            Net Area

Darchula               126
Baitadi               555
Dandeldhura           523
Feasibility studies of six schemes have been prepared as part of the prepara-
tion report and implementation of those which are economically viable can
proceed early in the project period. In addition to those already identified,
it is considered very likely that further small schemes would be proposed in
future District Development Plans and, consequently, allowance has been made
under the project for a somewhat larger irrigation development program. It
is estimated that some 1,365 ha would come under either new or improved
irrigation. This includes 1,105 ha of partially irrigated land improved to
full irrigation and 260 ha of rainfed land improved to partially irrigated.
A schedule of identified schemes is given in Annex 5, Table 1. The location
of schemes is shown on Map IBRD 14190.
5.26      Agricultural Objectives.  The general agricultural objectives of
irrigation development are to increase agricultural production so that farmers
may at least become self-sufficient in food production. More specifically,
cropping patterns proposed, include rice as the main subsistence crop and wheat
as the second, winter crop. Since the remoteness of the hill areas restricts
marketing opportunities, no cash crops have been included in proposed rotations.
5.27      Proposed Development.  Irrigation development in the project area
involves two main types of systems:
(a) Gravity irrigation systems in valleys and lower terraces with
diversion structures of larger tributaries and streams; and
(b) Improvement and development of hill terrace irrigation using
water from perennial and seasonal streams.
The general objective is to design schemes simple enough for farmers to under-
stand and operate and so that they are easy to construct, using as much of
local resources as possible. In all cases, initiative for development would
be generated by participating farmers and expressed through formulation of the
annual District Development Plan.
5.28      Distribution of supplies at the on-farm level would tend to follow
traditional practices of basin flooding from terrace to terrace. To some
extent, on-farm distribution may be improved by the construction of small
farm ditches aligned along property boundaries. All canals crossing contours
would be provided with adequate check/drop structures to prevent erosion
damage. As far as possible these would be built of local materials.
5.29      Of the schemes already identified, many would require technical
inputs for design and implementation which are not available at district
level. It is intended that these larger schemes would be undertaken by the
Department of Irrigation through their regional directorate in Nepalgunj,
while smaller schemes would be undertaken by LDD acting through the CDO and



- 29 -
DTO offices. In general terms, an arbitrary division between "large" and
"small" schemes is used by government and is usually set at 50 ha for projects
in hill areas. However, it is considered more important that technical com-
plexity should be the deciding criterion and final division of responsibility
should be determined with the assistance of the PC during the course of proj-
ect implementation.
5.30      "Major" Irrigation Schemes.  These schemes are proposed for valley
bottoms or lower terraces which can be commanded from contoured canals with
permanent headwork structures or perennial water sources. Commanded area would
generally be larger than 50 ha and main canal length would vary from 2 km to
9 km. A schedule of the 10 schemes identified during project preparation
and considered suitable for implementation by the Irrigation Department is
given below. Three of these have been studied in more detail and project
designs and cost estimates prepared as part of the preparation report.
Details of cost are given in Annex 7, Table 6.

5.31      "Minor" Hill Terrace Schemes.  Existing hill terrace irrigation
schemes are inefficient as diversion works are uncontrolled, canals do not
have escape facilities for removing excess water and maintenance standards of
poorly constructed canals are low. This results in high transmission losses.
Priority would be given to the improvement of existing main canal and distri-
bution works where resultant water savings can be utilized to ensure a second
irrigated crop. Wherever possible, water saved would be used to extend the
command area to additional terraces. Of the schemes identified during project
preparation, some five covering 232 ha are considered suitable for implementa-
tion by the LDD/DTO organization. In addition, it is considered most probable
that further small-scale village level schemes would be presented in district
development plans during the course of the project, and allowances have been
made for such development. Details of cost are given in Annex 7, Table 17.



- 30 -
4.   Forestry Development
5.32      In view of the fact that considerable areas (334,000 ha) of the
Mahakali Hills are under forest, it was decided at appraisal that protection
and exploitation of these areas were beyond the scope of a rural development
project. In addition, two of three project districts lack cadastral survey.
As a result of the Bank's recent sector report, a National Forestry Project is
currently under preparation by HMG with assistance from FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Program, completion of which is expected in mid-1979 and which will be pre-
sented to IDA for possible assistance in implementation. Development and
protection of forest areas within project districts would be covered under
this project.
5.   Health Services
5.33      Health services throughout project areas would be improved by con-
struction and upgrading of three 15 bed hospitals and 25 health posts; by
construction of three District Health Offices and staff accommodation, and by
increasing the supply of drugs, surgical, obstetric and medical equipment for
hospitals and health posts, and increasing the number of staff. Location of
health posts and hospitals is shown on Map IBRD 14189.
5.34      A new hospital and accommodation for in-patients would be constructed
at Dandeldhura. However, HMG has not yet decided whether to move the Evan-
gelical Mission Hospital, Pokhara, to Dandeldhura, or to absorb the hospital
within the Ministry of Health. In the event that the Mission Hospital is moved
to Dandeldhura or absorbed by HMG the proposal to construct in-patient accom-
modation at Dandeldhura and the concomitant proposals for increased staff and
equipment would not be implemented. Assurances were obtained that Secretary,
MOH would inform the Association, not later than eighteen months after credit
effectiveness, as to its decision in respect of movement of the Evangelical
Mission Hospital at Pokhara. Hospitals are institutions to which in-patients
are generally brought when their illnesses are terminal. Relatives are com-
pelled either to find accommodation near the hospital (which is rare) or to
walk several miles back and forth from their homes. There are also few eating
houses in the project area and hospitals provide food for neither patient nor
relative. The project would construct simple accommodation for relatives of
patients at each district hospital and provide living space equivalent to 50%
of the number of beds, together with facilities for the preparation of meals.
5.35      The project proposes to increase the existing number of health posts
by only two, both to be sited in Baitadi District. Existing health posts are
located in temporary and inadequate accommodation and the project would replace
these with suitable buildings. All construction would be under the supervision
of the Ministry of Health.
5.36      The project does not propose to increase the number of staff at
hospitals and health posts to the approved numbers as previous experience
under Credit 617-NEP indicates that such increases are not attainable. The
project particularly emphasizes increases in Jr. AHWs and panchayat and ward



- 31 -
level workers and who are the main source of contact with villagers and the
channel through which health education, hygiene and population control are
transmitted. Details of cost are given in Annex 7, Table 8.
6.   Education
5.37      The project would upgrade lower secondary and secondary schools
through provision of improved buildings and libraries; construct five hostels;
provide teaching aids for all schools; and, in cooperation with voluntary aid
agencies, increase the number of teachers in areas of critical deficiency --
mathematics and science. All construction would be supervised by the Ministry
of Education.
5.38      The provision of funds for teaching aids would, in particular, cover
blackboards, chalk, a desk for teachers, and a cupboard in primary schools;
expanded equipment for lower secondary schools; and science equipment for
secondary schools. Voluntary agencies would provide, on an average, four
science/mathematics teachers for secondary schools in the project area during
the project period. Details are given in Annex 7, Table 9.
7.   Panchayat Development
5.39      The project seeks to remedy deficiencies presently existing in
facilities available to residents of the project area. This would be accom-
plished through the construction of 22 multi-purpose panchayat community
centers with rest houses, by strengthening the staff of CDO offices, by pro-
viding for communication and discussion of the DAP, by training of staff and
panchayat members (particularly panchayat secretaries), and by providing for
expatriate technical assistance. Details are given in Annex 7, Table 10.
5.40      Multi-purpose community centers to be constructed at service centers
would not only comprise offices and accommodation for line department offi-
cials of HMG, but also act as a small assembly hall for panchayats and for
other community activities. In addition, since panchayat members have to
travel great distances and meetings last several hours (often into the night
after agricultural and other activities have finished), the project makes
provision for the construction of small panchayat rest houses.
5.41      A common area of deficiency is the ability to prepare and maintain
accounts. The project would strengthen the staff of CDO offices by addition
of an accountant, with supporting staff and equipment. It would also be the
responsibility of the accountant to assist village panchayat secretaries and
members of the district panchayat in developing basic expertise in accounting.
5.42      Training is essential to familiarize officials and panchayat members
with the components of district planning, methods of resource mobilization,
and techniques of monitoring and evaluation. This training would first
familiarize secretaries with components of the project. Thereafter, panchayat
secretaries would be given two weeks' training each year to upgrade their
skills. All training would be conducted at the Training Center to be con-
structed at Patan.



- 32 -
8.   District Technical Offices (DTO)
5.43      In the project area, the technical wing of each CDO's office is
already established but is poorly equipped and insufficiently staffed to
undertake the volume of work envisaged under the project. In addition, there
is little opportunity for district engineers to discuss technical problems
with more senior, experienced engineers within the MOWT organization.
5.44      Under the project, DTOs would be upgraded and strengthened, and a
senior engineer stationed in Patan to provide technical assistance to each
DTO in the form of design inputs, technical coordination and assistance with
construction. Staffing levels--at present, one Engineer is assigned to each
office--would be increased in order to undertake project works. A schedule of
staff requirements is shown in Annex 7, Table 15.   MOWT would be Fesponsible
for building new DTOs comprising an office, storage facilities and accommoda-
tion blocks for technical staff and their families. Office equipment would
include drawing and survey instruments, camping equipment and normal adminis-
trative requirements. No motorized vehicles are considered necessary. Pro-
vision is made for the purchase of horses and for their upkeep.
5.45      In addition, MOWT would establish a technical support unit at project
headquarters in Patan to provide technical inputs and support fcer DTOs and to
liaise with other related Departments. Staff requirements for'this District
Technical Support Unit (DTSU) are given at Annex 7, Table 16 and consist of a
Divisional Engineer supported by a Buildings Design Engineer and other neces-
sary Overseers, Draughtsmen and Surveyors.
5.46      DTSU would also be responsible for establishing, in conjunction with
the Meteorology Division of DIHM, a meteorological station either in Patan or
at the horticultural station at Satbanj.                       i
5.47      Training.  As part of project implementation, DTSU would arrange,
in conjunction with CDOs and DTOs, for a number of training programs to be
undertaken. These would aim at introducing simple survey and construction
techniques to villagers in order that they would be able to undertake an
increasing part of the investigation and supervision of village-level develop-
ment works. These courses would be organized in conjunction with water supply
technician training schemes offered by LDD/UNICEF.
9.   Village Water Supplies
5.48      In addition to general, country-wide activities, UNICEF has concen-
trated their attention on certain districts under their "Noted", or bilateral,
projects. These projects are being increased in number and under Phase E, it
is intended to implement some 75 rural water supply schemes in the three dis-
tricts of Dhoti, Dandeldhura and Baitadi. In view of the proposed project,
UNICEF has agreed in principle to include Darchula in the Phase E "Noted"
project. A condition of credit effectiveness would be that LDD had concluded
an agreement with UNICEF for inclusion of Darchula District under its village
water supply program Phase E.



- 33 -
5.49      LDD would be the responsible government implementing agency and,
as with other water supply schemes, villagers would be expected to make a
significant contribution towards the capital cost through the donation of
voluntary labor and provision of locally available materials. Training of
village level technicians would also form an important part of project imple-
mentation in order to improve the level of construction supervision and
subsequent maintenance.
5.50      In many cases, the sole source of drinking water for villages in
the project area is from small wells and springs. Under the project, some
225 wells would be improved through the construction of shelter structures,
provision of outlets and protection from waste-water drainage. Responsibility
for the program would rest with LDD who would use the technical staff of DTOs
for necessary surveys and construction supervision. Detailed costs are given
in Annex 7, Table 7.
5.51      To avoid duplication of financing, UNICEF would continue to assist
HMG in the implementation of piped water supplies in the area. However, UNICEF
would have difficulty in providing such infrastructure items as housing and
storage. The project would, therefore, include the provision of some staff
housing and storage for materials and fittings at LDD project headquarters to
be established at Dandeldhura.
10.  Soil Erosion
5.52      A Divisional Erosion Control Office would be established in Patan
to carry out erosion control works and undertake training and extension
activities in the project area. Details of staff requirements are given in
Annex 5, Table 2 and a schedule of buildings and equipment given in Annex 7,
Table 14.
5.53      Erosion control activities would concentrate on protection of the
Dandeldhura-Baitadi road which, although not yet complete, will be accessible
for dry-season 4-wheel drive vehicles by the time the project is underway.
Protection works would include the stabilization of gulleys which the road
alignment crosses, using wire-crate and dry boulder check dams to reduce
overall bed slopes. In addition, denuded areas of hill slopes adjacent to
the road would be revegetated by planting suitable grass and tree species.
5.54      Control measures would also be undertaken in association with other
project infrastructure to be developed, particularly irrigation schemes entail-
ing lengthy main canals contoured along hillsides. Again, such measures would
principally involve stabilization of gulleys threatening project works and
revegetation of denuded areas.
5.55      In addition to construction of protection works, the Divisional
Office would arrange for a number of local people to receive training in
erosion control principles and practices with a view to their returning to
their own villages and developing a wider awareness of the importance of soil
conservation. Detailed costs are presented in Annex 7, Table 14.



- 34 -
11. Development of Trails
5.56       Existing major trails would be upgraded, widened and improved.
Improvement works would involve trail widening; strengthening and stabilizing
steep slopes where erosion hazards endanger the trail; realignment in some
places to avoid particularly difficult sections or to improve gradients; con-
struction of wooden bridges and suspension or suspended bridges and development
of a maintenance program based on the panchayat organization.
5.57       In all cases, the identification of and construction priority of
bridges and trail improvement works would be carried out by the village and
district panchayats and presented in the annual District Development Plan.
Technical studies, designs and implementation would be carried out by tech-
nical staff of DTSU and DTOs, with specialist inputs provided by the
Suspension Bridge Division or LDD, as and when necessary. Existing trails
and those proposed for improvement are shown on Map IBRD 14190.
5.58       Some 250 km of main trail and 340 km of secondary trail would be
improved as follows:
Main Trail                        Length (km)
Mahendranagar - Dandeldhura                 125
Pokhara - Bajhang - Satbanj                  40
Barakot - Binabasti                          22
Gokuleshwar - Dehathala                       8
Darchula - Kalanga Chetti                    55
250
Minor Trail
Rupal - Dehimandu                            68
Patan - Dehathala                            64
Sormali - Patan                              30
Sankarpur - Chokham                          56
Rauleshwar - Thalakanda                      33
Sormala - Baitadi                            46
Gwalekh - Julaghat                           15
Gokuleshwar - Dhap                           28
340
5.59       Timber Bridges.  Since lack of permanent crossings are the main
constraint to continuous access, a number of bridges are proposed for construc-
tion under the project. Where crossings are of short span and site conditions
permit, these will be of local timber using boulder-rubble cratework for any
necessary abutments. It is estimated that about 128 timber bridges would be
constructed, 40 in Dandeldhura District, 68 in Baitadi and 20 in Darchula.
Final numbers and locations would be determined during project implementation.



- 35 -
5.60      Suspension Bridges.  Some 19 bridge sites have been identified
during project preparation and their location is shown on Map IBRD 14190.
Their locations are at traditional crossing points on existing main trails.
However, the exact locations will depend largely on the results of technical
studies to be carried out during the project. Of 19 bridges, it is estimated
that 16 would be short to medium span suspended bridges while 3 would probably
be longer span suspension type bridges. The latter would have spans of around
90 m and would require either a well-braced timber or steel tower and well-
anchored wind brace cables on each side. Standard designs and simple con-
struction techniques have been developed by the Suspension Bridge Division of
HMG Roads Department. Smaller span bridges, on the other hand, can often be
more simply designed and constructed using local materials. An implementation
schedule is given in Annex 5, Table 9 and indicates the phasing of the various
project activities.
5.61      Maintenance.  During the project period, an annual trail maintenance
program would be undertaken. This would combine routine repair works after
each monsoon season with any minor improvements necessary, such as dry-stone
retaining walls or cross-drainage facilities. Similarly, bridge maintenance
work would, as far as possible, be organized by district or village panchayats
using semi-skilled village technicians trained during the course of construc-
tion. Major maintenance works requiring imported materials would be undertaken
by the Suspension Bridge Division, acting through the Divisional Office at
Patan. These works would continue to be funded by government, though any
unskilled labor element would be contributed by local people. A detailed cost
breakdown is given in Annex 7, Table 13.
12. Postal Services
5.62      To improve postal services, the project would provide furniture
and fittings such as sorting tables, racks, safes, etc., for all existing
post offices so as to enable the proper and timely handling of mail and to
allow for an expansion of services. To improve mail delivery and expand
services, an extra-departmental post office would be constructed and staffed
at each service center to be set up under the project. Fifty small relay
stations would be constructed at strategic locations to provide shelter
for mail runners. Details are given in Annex 7, Table 11.
13. Cottage Industries
5.63      Except for woolen products, little is known about market pros-
pects for cotton goods, iron and wooden products and leatherwork, as these
items are generally produced for home consumption and face severe competition
from items of Indian manufacture. Consequently, a study would be carried out
in the project area to determine:
(a) Existing levels of skill of those participating in cotton,
metal, wood and leather good production;
(b) Existing quantities and quality of goods produced;



- 36 -
(c) Existing sources, prices and availability of raw materials;
(d) Existing marketing arrangements and prices paid for goods; and
(e) Existing financial arrangements.
The study would make recommendations on:
(a) The type of support required by each sub-sector;
(b) Measures required to improve productivity, quality and
marketing of various products;
(c) Training requirements of cottage industry workers; and
(d) The role and responsibilties of public and private agencies
in marketing, training, technical assistance, supply of
materials and provision of credit.
5.64      DVCI would carry out the study and the project provides for 6 man-
months of expatriate consultant time to head the study and for the services
of two locally engaged consultants, one responsible for technical aspects of
the study and the other for marketing. Assurances would be sought at nego-
tiations that the cottage industry study would be initiated within twelve
months of credit effectiveness.
5.65      In parallel with the study, the project would support the develop-
ment of wool-based cottage industry and would establish, equip and staff
three district cottage industry centers located at each district headquarters.
Office space, training facilities, storage and accommodation for DCVI staff
would be included. In Darchula district where most wool-based industries are
located, two small buildings would be constructed (attached to service centers)
for training purposes in remote areas. At these centers, training equipment,
including improved looms, spinning wheels and raw materials, would be located.
Trainees would receive a small stipend (Rs 7.50 per day) during training.
5.66      To improve DCVI staff quality, the project would provide for over-
seas training of 4 district staff in production of woolen goods (2), cotton
weaving (1), and marketing (1). Training would consist of three months in
India. Priority of those selected for training would be given to locally
resident staff and that those selected would undertake to serve in the
project area for at least two years from the date of return.
5.67      To assist cottage industry workers in purchasing equipment, improved
tools and raw materials, the project would provide credit to be channeled
through ADBN. Details are given in Annex 7, Table 12. Controlled goods,
which include cotton yarn, are allowed entry into Nepal only through desig-
nated points. The nearest such official point is located in Kanchanpur
District and a branch office of the Cottage Industries and Handicrafts



- 37 -
Emporium is responsible for importing, for the entire Mahakali Zone, equip-
ment and raw materials from India as well as exporting finished products.
The project would upgrade the existing branch office by providing additional
storage, staff and equipment. Details are at Annex 7, Table 12.
14. Technical Assistance
5.68      Through a UNDP technical assistance agreement, three internationally
recruited staff would be employed for three years to assist in project imple-
mentation. An Assistant to the Project Coordinator would help develop pro-
cedures and expertise at district level in planning, budgeting and project
implementation and assist in setting up a system for project monitoring,
disbursement and accounting. A Civil Engineer would work with staff of DTSU
and DTOs in planning, design and implementation of work programs for project
buildings, bridges, trail improvement, and construction of hill terrace irri-
gation. A Socio-economist would formulate and develop procedures for monitor-
ing the socio-economic impact of the project on participants and assist in
analysis of data collected. The Socio-economist would design and carry out
such ad hoc studies as are necessary to monitor progress and provide guidance
to project management in project implementation. It would be a condition of
credit effectiveness that HMG had made arrangements satisfactory to IDA for
the employment of the technical experts required. The signed UNDP Project
Document in respect of technical assistance would satisfy this condition so
that IDA could initiate staff recruitment. Details are given in Annex 7,
Table 19.
15. Project Monitoring and Evaluation
5.69      The Socio-economic Unit set up under the first Rural Development
Project (Credit 617-NEP) has provided data regarding project progress and
also pointed to areas of concern and suggested ways to resolve such problems.
The utility of the unit has been well accepted and has become an integral part
of the Project Coordinator's Office. The unit, however, lacks a supervisor
with experience in designing, conducting, and interpreting surveys relevant
to project's goals and is understaffed. The project would strengthen the
existing socio-economic unit, to be located in the office of the Chief Project
Coordinator, through the appointment of additional staff and provide under
technical assistance an expatriate supervisor of the unit (para 5.68).
Furthermore, it would train local counterpart staff and provide funds for
project evaluation.
5.70      Project Monitoring.  The unit would be responsible for designing
a baseline survey of the three project districts, which study would, inter
alia, include the collection of information relating to: present farm produc-
tion and landholding sizes in different ecological zones; the division of
labor between agriculture and household activities, including their relative
contributions to household income and the time taken in the performance of
daily household tasks; an estimation of the availability of labor for project
works and the potential effect of caste prohibitions on such availability;
supplementary sources of income (for example, livestock, cottage industries)



- 38 -
and their relation to landholding sizes; access to governmental services and
attitudes towards officials and elected representatives; and present family
incomes and indebtedness.
5.71      The project would also periodically monitor the progress of project
implementation through surveys of the impact of new irrigation works, and
effects on cropping intensity; the extent of employment generated by proj-
ect works, including who the beneficiaries of such works are; access to
agricultural inputs; and adoption of new agricultural practices. The unit
would also be responsible for preparing, under the supervision of the Chief
Project Coordinator, the semi-annual project reports.
5.72      Project Evaluation.  The project, acting through the Socio-economist
would provide funds for the employment of a firm or individual consultants on
a short-term basis to: assist in determining the causes of any problems, or
unanticipated changes in implementation that occur during project implementa-
tion; and prepare the project completion report. The project would also
provide funds for feasibility studies and preparation of a further rural
development/agricultural project. Details of costs are at Annex 7, Table 18.
16. Project Management
5.73      The project provides for the development of project headquarters to
be located at Patan in Baitadi District. For location, see Map 14189. An
office building, staff quarters and a training center would be constructed
and water and electricity supplies and office and training equipment provided.
Details are at Annex 7, Table 15.
VI. COST ESTIMATES
6.01      Total estimated five year project cost, including contingencies,
is NRs 160.4M (US$13.45M) and which includes a negligible amount of taxes and
duties. Details, summarized below, are in Annex 7, Table 1. Foreign exchange,
amounting to 30% of total project cost is US$4.OM. Cost estimates are based
on findings during appraisal, updated to March 1979, and are inclusive of
allowances for transportation to the project area. Physical contingencies of
10% have been added to construction costs of all buildings and 15% to costs
of trails, piping, irrigation and erosion control works. Price contingencies
are estimated at about 21% of project cost and based on the following:
1979/80      1980/84
Civil works and all
other project costs              8%           8%
Equipment and vehicles           0.5%           6%

Percent                        (11)    (81)   (8)
6.03      The IDA credit of US$11.0 M would finance all foreign exchange costs
(excluding UNDP financing) and 86% of local costs, equivalent to 81% of total
project cost. HMGN would contribute about 11% and UNDP 8% (through technical
assistance) of total project cost.
6.04      IDA funds would be channeled through the Ministry of Finance to
participating ministerial budgets. Agricultural credit funds (US$350,000) 1/
would be on-lent to ADBN at 6% and 4% per annum for short- and medium-term
loans, respectively, equivalent to present rediscount facilities of the
Central Bank. In line with present policy, ADBN would lend to cooperatives
at 10% and 8%, who, in turn, would on-lend to farmers at 14% and 11%, for
short- and medium-term loans respectively. Funds for technical assistance
would be from UNDP under existing procedures. Interest margins would be
adequate to cover all operating expenditures and charges, including taxes
and borrowing from all sources and are sufficient to maintain adequate
reserves to meet reasonable bad debt risks. Inflation in Nepal over the
past three years has averaged 6.7% per annum and is not expected to exceed
7% annually over the next three years. Therefore, the proposed rates to
the ultimate borrowers would be positive in real terms and compare favorably
with real interest rates in other developing countries.
6.05      Procurement.  Procurement of equipment, furniture and vehicles
(US$908,000), involving contracts above US$100,000 would be on the basis of
international competitive bidding (ICB) in accordance with IDA guidelines.
Orders of less than US$100,000 would be purchased under HMG procurement
procedures which are satisfactory. Because of the remoteness of the project
area and small size of individual schemes, it would not be practical to group
civil works contracts (US$5.8 M) for ICB or local competitive bidding (LCB).
Consequently, civil works would either be undertaken by the Ministry concerned,
using local labor, with the exception of works on "major" irrigation schemes
(US$659,000) which would be subject to LCB. Assurances were obtained that
the above-mentioned procedures would be followed.
6.06      Disbursement of funds would be on the following basis:
(a) 90% of local expenditures for civil works carried out
either by contract or by force account;
1/   Net of price contingencies.



- 41 -
(b)  100% of foreign expenditures for directly imported equipment,
furniture and vehicles and 100% of local expenditures (ex-
factory cost) for locally manufactured goods and 90% of
local expenditure for other goods procured locally;
(c)  90% of agricultural and cottage industry subloans disbursed
by ADBN;
(d)  100% of foreign expenditures for training;
(e)  100% of total expenditures for consultant services; and
(f)  90% of local expenditures for salaries and allowances of staff
engaged in the project in agricultural and livestock development,
cooperatives, AIC, health, cottage industry, civil engineering,
training and in project management, monitoring and evaluation.
Disbursement against civil works carried out by force account and by contracts
costing US$5,000 equivalent or less and against (c) and (f) above would be
made against statements of expenditures. The documentation for which would
not be submitted for review but would be retained by HMG and made available
for inspection by accredited IDA representatives during the course of project
supervision. Requests for disbursement against other items would be fully
documented. Disbursement estimates are given in Annex 6, Table 1. Any funds
remaining in the Credit Account upon project completion would be cancelled.
6.07      Accounts and Audit.  HMGN would cause participating Government Min-
istries, ADBN, DDC and AIC (a) to establish and maintain separate accounts
for the project in accordance with sound accounting practices and insure that
these accounts would be audited annually by an independent auditor acceptable
to IDA; and (b) to send certified copies of the audited account and auditor's
report to IDA within 12 months after the close of each fiscal year. The audit
report would be required to include inter alia, a statement that funds dis-
bursed against statements of expenditure had been used for the purpose for
which they were provided. Assurances were obtained that the above-mentioned
accounting and audit procedures would be adopted.
VII. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Central Level
7.01      In December 1978, His Majesty the King, acting on the advice of a
special committee set up for the purpose, decided to reorganize and strengthen
the arrangements for execution of rural development projects. This rearrange-
ment entailed, firstly, the establishment of a new committee at Cabinet level,
chaired by the Prime Minister and responsible for setting overall policy on
matters of panchayat development and secondly, a series of administrative
changes within MOHP to cater to an increasing number of international agencies
involved in integrated rural development projects and to improve project
coordination, particularly at the Zonal level (para 7.04). At the Central



- 42 -
Government level, these changes involve the setting up of a Central Coordinat-
ing Committee (replacing the previously established Project Coordinating
Committee), chaired by the Minister of Home Panchayat and including represent-
atives of the National Panchayat, Back-to-the-Village National Campaign Com-
mittee (BVNCC), Secretaries of involved Line Ministries (designated as Project
Officers - para 7.02) and with Member/Secretary, a Central Project Coordinator
(CPC), holding the rank of Additional Secretary. To assist CPC in carrying
out his duties, five new administrative divisions have been established within
MOHP, responsible for resource mobilization, training, research, coordination
and panchayat development. A Joint Secretary would be in charge of each
division. CPC, operating through the five administrative divisions, would
ensure inter-project coordination, funding, provide general administrative
support in project implementation and monitor and evaluate progress. For
details see Chart.
7.02      While responsibility for implementation of individual project compo-
nents still rests with designated Project Officers from the ministries and
agencies involved 1/, overall responsibility for coordination of project
planning and implementation would be vested in MOHP and exercised by the
Central Coordinating Committee (CCC).
Zonal Level
7.03      A Zonal Coordinating Committee (ZCC) would be established for rural
development projects within each zone. It would be chaired by the Zonal Com-
missioner and comprise Chief District Officers, Regional Directors of line
departments, BVNCC District Chairmen, District Panchayat Chairmen and have
the PC as member/secretary. Assurances were obtained that ZCC would be
established and maintained.
7.04      While the provisions of DAP are expected to resolve many of the
issues that may arise in execution of the- project at district level, there is
need to ensure coordination of policies and programs at the Zonal level. To
these ends, there would be a full-time PC (of at least joint secretary level)
appointed from MOHP and who would be under the general direction and supervi-
sion of CPC. PC would be assisted by an expatriate assistant appointed under
the technical assistance component of the project and would be located within
the project area at Patan. Assurances were obtained that a full-time Project
Coordinator would be appointed with qualifications and experience satisfactory
to the Association.
1/   The ministries participating in the project would be the Food, Agriculture
and Irrigation (agricultural extension, research, training and livestock
development); Forests (erosion control); Home Panchayat (project imple-
mentation, village water supplies, trails and small foot bridges); Health
(hospitals and health posts); Education (schools, hostels, teachers);
Works and Transport (tracks, minor irrigation and large suspension bridges);
Land Reform (cooperatives); Industry (cottage industries); and Finance.
In addition, the Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) (farm
credit), and the Agricultural Input Corporation (farm inputs) will be
represented on the Central Coordination Committee.



- 43 -
7.05      The responsibilities of ZCC would be to coordinate project activ-
ities of participating ministries and agencies in the project area; keep under
regular review the progress of the project, by means of semi-annual reports
to be submitted by the Project Coordinator; review and evolve, as necessary,
procedures for smooth project implementation and monitoring; and identify
bottlenecks hindering project progress and prescribe, as necessary, remedial
measures to overcome them. In addition the committee would provide guidelines
on (i) directives and nature of support which should be given by central line
agencies to the districts; and (ii) time schedules for planning, preparation,
approval and implementation of sub-projects; endorse district plans insofar as
these relate to the project, such endorsement being by way of common consent;
and meet, on a quarterly basis, or more frequently if deemed necessary by the
chairman or by at least two members.
7.06      Project Level.  The project does not envisage any departure from
the standard procedural rules of Government insofar as they apply to planning
approval, budgetary procedures or the responsibilities of the Ministry of
Finance relating to budgetary submissions, approvals, compilation and trans-
fers. PC would play an important role in preparation of financial estimates
and district development and would assist CDOs and District Secretariats in
the preparation of these development plans and detailed implementation sched-
ules within the broad framework of: (i) project proposals; (ii) requirements
of DAP; and (iii) technical guidelines from central line agencies. Although
PC's role would be advisory, he would have the responsibility of drawing
disputes and conflicting priorities irreconciliable at the district level to
the attention of the relevant ministries and central agencies and, if neces-
sary, to the ZCC for resolution. PC would also provide assistance and advice
to central line departments of Government in the timing, phasing and contents
of their inputs to district plans. PC would then present completed plans to
ZCC in good time for endorsement and to assist District Secretariats in making
any subsequent revisions which may be considered necessary by ZCC and there-
after ensure their timely submission for-approval to CCC. Finally, PC would
monitor the process whereby each concerned ministry and agency makes identi-
fiable budgetary requests for financial provision to implement the planned
project components and would collate such requests for the ZCC and the
Finance Ministry.
7.07      Although withdrawals from the IDA credit would be by way of indivi-
dual applications by line departments through their ministries to the Ministry
of Finance, accounting responsibilities in this regard would remain with the
Accountant General. For easier administration, CPC would be delegated respon-
sibility for submitting withdrawal requests to IDA.
7.08      District and Village Level.  Execution of individual project compo-
nents in the field would be in accordance with regulations published under the
District Panchayat Act and would be undertaken by local staff of participating
ministries, in coordination with village and district panchayats and under the
guidance of CDO. This is in consonance with DAP.
7.09      The District Secretariat, with assistance from the PC, would prepare
a District Development Plan in consultation with the district panchayat.
Participating ministries/ agencies would then provide technical clearance of



- 44 -
their components through their designated project officers. Individual com-
ponents of the plan would then be implemented under the direct supervision
of the technical functionaries of the concerned ministries, but under the
overall guidance of the CDO and with the support and cooperation of the
district panchayat. Assurances were obtained that District Development
Plans would be submitted to IDA for comment and that budgetary allocations
to districts would be made in amounts sufficient for the project.
7.10      Project Staffing.  Existing levels of staffing of all participating
departments would be supplemented by additional project staff (Annex 7, Tables
1-19), who are available, and whose costs (NRs 17.3 M) represents less than 11%
of total project costs. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that staff
would be appointed as scheduled in Annex 7. Furthermore, assurances were
obtained that HMG, would provide sufficient land for project buildings.
7.11      Project Management.  The PC's Office would be established in Patan
to provide technical and administrative support to district development pro-
grams. Besides PC, technical support would be provided by an Agronomist,
Training and Communications Officer, Livestock Officer and staff of DTSU.
Administrative support would come from a Programs Officer (to assist with
district planning and budgeting) and clerical and accounting staff. Through
Technical Assistance (para 5.68) additional support would be provided by an
Assistant to PC, a Socio-economist, and a Civil Engineer to be attached to
DTSU.
7.12      Project Monitoring & Evaluation.  Monitoring of project implementa-
tion would be conducted on a day-to-day basis by the PDO, under the guidance
of CDO. Project Officers would ensure that project components under their
purview were being satisfactorily implemented. PC would, however, be respon-
sible for overall monitoring of project progress and would keep ZCC and IDA
informed on a regular basis. HMG would carry out an evaluation of the socio-
economic impact of the project on selected areas of project districts. Tech-
nical assistance (para 5.68) would be provided to help develop procedures for
monitoring and for analysis and interpretation of data.
VIII. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND INCOMES
8.01      Cropping Patterns and Yields.  Present cropping pattern and yields
are discussed in detail in Chapter IV and Annex 3. In the "future without
project" situation, no significant change would be expected except for a slight
shift from local to improved crop varieties. Under the project, the provision
of improved agricultural extension and supporting services would increase
yields of traditional crops. Irrigation development would provide full irri-
gation to about 1,105 ha of presently partially irrigated land, and partial
supply to about 260 ha of rainfed land. Cropping intensity, however, would
remain unchanged at 147% for the project area overall since the amount of
incremental irrigation financed under the project is relatively small (about
2% of the total net cultivated area). Consequently, benefits are reflected
through yield improvements rather than increased cropping intensity. Detailed
cropping patterns are presented in Annex 3, Table 1 and summarized below:

Paddy and wheat yields would increase significantly due to the availability of
suitable improved varieties whereas, the prospects for increasing maize, millet
and barley yields, are somewhat limited. However, present low yields offer
much scope for improvement, through adoption of improved cultural practices and
use of better seed.
8.03       Incremental Production.  At full development, paddy production is
expected to increase by some 8,250 tons, wheat by 4,730 tons, maize by 5,000
tons, millet by 3,000 tons, potatoes by 1,650 tons, barley by 1,560 tons,
pulses and oilseeds by 220 tons each, fruit by 570 tons and vegetables by 500
tons. Production increases from livestock through improved extension services,
inoculation and dosing programs would result in increased production of milk,
meat, wool, hair and dung valued at NRs 5.70 M annually. 1/
1/   Gross value of production in financial prices.



- 47 -
8.04      Marketing.  Almost all increased production would be consumed on farm
to help meet subsistence needs (para 9.04). Ghee would be marketed across the
border in India where there is a high demand for the product. Incremental wool
production would be readily absorbed in the project area since wool based
cottage industries presently have to import wool from Tibet and India. Conse-
quently, no marketing constraints are foreseen for any incremental production
resulting from project actions.
8.05      Farm Incomes.  Choice of farm models is based on representative farm
sizes and cropping patterns for the various ecological zones found in the
project area (Annex 2). For purpose of analysis, farm models would cover
zones where a paddy-wheat rotation is practical (Zones I & II); that covering
the maize-millet-wheat rotation (Zone III); and the high altitude zone (Zone
IV) where potato production predominates. Two representative farm sizes would
typify each zone: 0.5 ha, representing small farms, amounting to about 90% of
all holdings and 70% of cultivated area; and a 1.5 ha farm, representing larger
farms, amounting to about 10% of holdings and 30% of the area. Basic assump-
tions used in analysis of farm budgets is given in Annex 2, Table 5. On the
basis of these assumptions, net farm incomes are estimated in Annex 3, Table 3
and summarized below:
Zones I & II          Zone III        Zone IV
Farm Size (ha)      W       WI    W2       W       Wi    W      W1

W: future without project, WI future with project (extension)
W2: future with project (extension and irrigation)
Net farm incomes would increase by 50-130%. Small farmers (0.5 ha) would have
higher incremental income per ha due to more intensive cropping.
8.06      Distribution Effects.  In comparing project area income levels with
those of the average national income, it must be noted that figures presented
above, which include the imputed value of home consumption valued at farm gate
prices, have to be adjusted for the difference between farmgate and local
retail prices (about 25%). Furthermore off-farm incomes would have to be
included. Assuming an average family size of 6 people, the per capita income
of the poorest group under the "future without project" situation is estimated
at NRs 240 or about 17% of the national figure of NRs 1,400 1/. At full
development per capita incomes would increase to NRs 340 or about a quarter
of the national average. Per capita incomes of larger farmers (1.5 ha farms)
is estimated at about NRs 280 or about 20% of the national average. Under the
project per capita income of this group would increase to NRs 580 (40% of the
national average).
1/   At present, the per capita income is estimated at US$120 and which is
assumed to be constant at full development of the project (about 1990).

IX. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
9.01      Production Benefits.  At full development, the project would increase
foodgrain production by 20,000 tons, potatoes by 1,600 tons, pulses and oilseed
by 440 tons and fruit and vegetables by 1,000 tons. In addition, livestock
programs would increase milk, wool, hair, dung and meat production by NRs 1.8 M
annually. 1/ As a result, the net foreign exchange saving would be about US$2
million per annum.
9.02      Employment Benefits.  Increased production from the project would
help reduce underemployment on farms and over the project period development
of infrastructure would provide about 4.0 M man days of employment, mainly in
construction.
9.03      Other Benefits.  Due to scarcity of data, some benefits that would
be generated by the project are difficult to quantify. These include higher
prices for milk, horticultural and cottage industry products, improvements in
crop and livestock quality and reductions in arable land lost as a result of
the erosion control program. Benefits from social and welfare programs are
also non-quantifiable. Mlore importantly, the project would help slow down
permanent migration from the project area, which in turn would reduce popu-
lation pressures on scarce land resources elsewhere in Nepal.
9.04      Nutritional Impact.  Under the "future without project" situation,
production of food would suffice the average family for about 295 days at
minimum subsistence levels (2,000 calories per day for an adult) or about 250
days at average subsistence levels (2,500 calories per day). At full develop-
ment, increased production resulting from project actions would raise food
levels to about 410 days at minimum subsistence levels and 330 days at average
subsistence levels. Assumptions underlying the assessment of the nutritional
impact of the project are presented in Annex 3, Table 4.
Economic Evaluation
9.05      Assumptions underlying the economic evaluation of the project are
presented in Annex 4. Shadow prices have been used to correct price distor-
tions of non-traded goods caused by tariffs and trade restrictions, and to
reflect seasonal characteristics of the labor market. Where possible, bene-
fits and costs associated with each component have been evaluated separately.
Economic Rates of Return (ERR)
9.06      The Project.  Economic costs of agricultural, horticultural,
livestock and irrigation development and those of trail and bridge construc-
tion and erosion control together with costs of project administration and
operation and maintenance have been included in the analysis. Costs and
benefits of social and welfare programs have not been included as benefits
are non-quantifiable. Quantifiable project benefits include those generated
1/   Net incremental benefits in economic prices.



- 49 -
from improved agricultural extension and supporting services, livestock and
horticultural programs. Discounting costs and benefits over a 20 year period,
the economic rate of return (ERR) for the project is estimated at 21%. Costs
and benefits are detailed in Annex 4, Table 4.
9.07      Agricultural Development.  Quantifiable benefits attributable to
agricultural development are yield improvements caused by adoption of improved
cultural practices and a shift to a wider use of improved crop varieties. At
full development, it is assumed that about 40% of the crop area would be
planted to improved and higher yielding varieties; average yields of major
crops would increase by about 30-50% or at a compound rate of 1.1 to 1.5% per
annum from present yield levels.  At full developmeat, net economic incremeatal
benefits would be about NRs 28.2 M annually (Annex 4, Table 3). Capital and
operating costs of agricultural extension and training, credit and input
supply, and a fraction (about 20%) of project administrative costs have been
included in the analysis. Assuming a build-up of benefits over 5 years and
discounting these over a period of 20 years, the ERR of this component is
estimated at 50%. Detailed streams of costs and benefits are presented in
Annex 4, Table 4. The high rate of return of this component is due to low
investment cost per ha and per farm family (about US$25/ ha of cropped area and
US$40 per agricultural household over the project period).
9.08      Irrigation Development.  The project would provide full irrigation
to about 1,105 ha of existing but partially irrigated land and a partial sup-
ply to a further 260 ha of rainfed land. The incremental oater s ipply would
largely be used to irrigate paddy, wheat and potato crops. At full develop-
ment, annual incremental benefits generated by irrigation would be about
NRs 2.0 M. Capital and operating costs of both "major" and "minor" schemes
as well as a fraction of project administrative costs (aboujt 15%) have been
included in the analysis. Assuming a 5 year build up period and discounting
costs and benefits over a period of 20 years, the ERR of the irrigation compo-
nent is estimated at 12%. Detailed streams of costs and benefits are presented
in Annex 4, Table 4.
9.09      Livestock Development.  Benefits from livestock development are gene-
rated from extension efforts as well as innoculation and dosing program. By
the end of the project period, it is assumed that these programs would cover
about 25% of total buffalo population, 10,000 oxen and 21,000 cows (about 20%
of total cattle population). The impact of livestock programs would be to
reduce mortality rates, and to improve milk yields of these animals by 10%.
The 3% reduction in mortality rates is translated into savings of milk from
female animals, and additional manure collected. No benefits are attributed to
work oxen because of difficulties in quantification. Incremental benefits from
dosing sheep and goats and by dipping arise from a reduction in lambing losses,
which would be reduced from 30% to 20%. Benefits coming from these animals are
quantified through incremental production of wool and meat. Net annual incre-
mental benefits would amount to about NRs 1.25 M at full development. Any
benefits derived from the breeding program for buffalo have not been quantified.
Costs, include the capital and operating costs of extension, inoculation and
dosing programs, as well as 5% of project administrqtiori costs.  Tre ERR :F
this component is estimated at 15%. Detailed cost and benefit streams are
presented in Annex 4, Table 4.



- 50 -
9.10      Horticulture Development.  The horticultural development program
would cover about 40 ha of additional fruit trees and 100 ha of vegetables.
It is estimated that about 600 tons of fruit and 500 tons of vegetables would
be produced annually and valued at NRs 2.0 M. Costs are difficult to assess as
advice to growers would be given in the normal course of extension activities.
Consequently, the ERR has not been calculated for this component. However, net
benefits are included in the analysis of the project as a whole.
Sensitivity Analysis and Project Risk
9.11      A sensitivity analysis has been carried out to illustrate the effects
of various factors on the viability of the project.
Economic Rate of Return
(a)  Basic Case                                    21
(b)  Standard Conversion Factor = 1                19
(c)  Construction costs increased by 50%           18
(d) Decrease in projected value of
production by 20%                          16
(e) Full benefits reached 5 years
later than anticipated                     17
(f) Construction costs increased by
50% and yields decreased by 20%            14
The results show that there is moderate sensitivity to increases in construc-
tion costs and to assumptions used in estimating projected yields.
9.12      In view of the remoteness of the project area, the greatest risk
lies in the availability and willingness of government staff to live and work
in project areas. The project is designed to minimize this risk by providing
accommodation, project allowance and social amenities to create sufficient
incentives for staff participation. Lack of communications and means of trans-
portation may also affect farmers' participation in the project. To minimize
this risk, activities would be decentralized to service centers throughout the
project area. In addition, tracks and trails would be improved to facilitate
delivery of inputs.
X. AGREEMENTS SOUGHT AND RECOMMENDATIONS
10.01     During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) Detailed proposals for agricultural training would be sub-
mitted to the Association for comment within twelve months

APPRAISAL OF SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - MAHAKALI HILLS
The First Rural Development Project (Credit 617-NEP)
1.        Project Content.  The Project comprises:
(a) Development of more intensive agricultural extension accom-
panied by wider use of improved crop varieties, establishment
of farmer and staff training, improvements in marketing of
horticultural produce and upgrading of research stations;
(b) Livestock development through improved animal health ser-
vices, small cheese/butter plants, a livestock market, an
exchange program for improved sires, and improved fodder
resources;
(c) Establishment of a district organization for improvement
and extension of hill and river terrace, and river valley
irrigation;
(d) Improvements in availability of inputs through provision
of small warehouses and credit;
(e) Soil erosion control;
(f) Health centers and development of village water supplies;
(g) Tracks and footbridges and upgrading of existing trials; and
(h) Improvement of cottage industries.
Total estimated project cost, inclusive of contingencies, is NR 136.0 mil-
lion (US$10.9 million). The IDA credit of US$8.0 million covers all foreign
costs and 52% of local costs. Through a UNDP financed technical assistance
credit of US$500,000, two internationally recruited staff are assisting
implementation in the fields of administrative assistance to the Project
Coordinator and development of minor hill irrigation schemes. The UNDP
credit also provides assistance in project monitoring and evaluation.
2.        Project Management.  While responsibility for implementation of
specific components of the project rests with designated Project Officers



- 53 -
ANNEX 1
Page 2
from the ministries and agencies involved, 1/ overall responsibility for
coordination of project planning and implementation is vested in the Ministry
of Home Panchayat and exercised by a Project Coordinating Committee (PCC),
chaired by the Minister of Home Panchayat. The PCC, comprising designated
Project Officers, sets guidelines for implementation of the project, is
entrusted with ensuring proper coordination among participating ministries
and agencies, and regularly reviews and monitors progress. The Chief
District Officers (CDOs) from Rasuwa and Nuwakot are also PCC members.
3.        A Project Coordination (PC) appointed from the Ministry of Home
Panchayat, is a PCC member and secretary. PC advises and assists District
Secretariats and coordinates with the various ministries in developing detailed
development plans and implementation schedules within the framework of the
project proposals. He also assures the timely presentation of these plans to
PCC. PC also coordinates and monitors the provision and use of project funds
by the various ministries and agencies, and assures that procedures required
by the Association for withdrawal of funds are complied with.
4.        Health.  The project provides for the construction of 15 health
posts over a period of five years; employment of additional personnel and
increase in the amount of drugs for each health post. The number of health
posts opened has exceeded annual targets. There are now 2 new, adequately
staffed, health posts in the project area. There are, however, a few prob-
lems: 14 other existing health posts are presently located in rented accom-
modation. This is the result of financial procedures adopted by the MOH which
were at variance with project procedures, viz., the Ministry required pre-
payment for construction of the posts. This problem has now been resolved.
The supply of drugs under the project lasts only 3-6 months, but this problem
is common to the entire country. The funding for drugs has now been raised
so as to allow for approximately 8 months' supply. Further increases would
be unadvisable for two reasons: firstly, it would create too noticeable a
difference between project health posts and others located elsewhere; and,
secondly, HMG would not be in a position to continue the level of funding
after the project period.
5.        Cottage Industries.  The performance of this component has consist-
ently been good. The project target is training of 300 weavers in the use
of improved looms which would then be sold to trainees on installment, and
1/   The ministries participating in the project are the Fcod, Agriculture
and Irrigation (agricultural extension, research, training, irrigation
and livestock development); Forests (reafforestation, regeneration and
erosion control); Panchayat (project implementation, village water sup-
plies, trails, small foot bridges, fuel and fodder plantations); Health
(health posts); Works and Transport (tracks, large suspension bridges);
Land Reform (cooperatves); Industry (cottage industries); and Finance.
In addition, the Agricultural Development Bank of Nepal (ADBN) (farm
credit), the Dairy Development Corporation (butter and cheese plant),
and the Agricultural Input Corporation (farm inputs) are represented
on the Project Coordination Committee.

Page 3
the provision of credit facilities.  There are now 6 training sub-centers at
which 125 trainees (including 33 women) have received, or are being given,
training.  The success of this component has induced the DCVI to consider
expanded training facilities and the inclusion of other types of training
(such as in leather and blacksmithy). This expansion would follow a market-
ing study presently being conducted.
6.        Cooperatives.  The original project goal of 25 cooperatives was
reduced at the request of the panchayats to 18 (12 in Nuwakot district and
6 in Rasuwa). It was felt that it would be more valuable to strengthen exist-
ing cooperatives and broaden their membership base, than to open new coopera-
tives. After the decision to reduce the total number was arrived at in 1977,
a concerted membership drive, together with increased popular participation
in decision-making, has increased membership (from about 10 to 18% of the
eligible population). An innovative form of group credit was started at
Tupche, in Nuwakot district, with the assistance of ADBN. The scheme, known
as the Small Farmer's Group Credit scheme, involves the provision of credit
to farmers, who are otherwise not eligible for credit for productive purposes
under the normal ADBN or commercial bank criteria. This covers the fields of
reafforestation, minor irrigation and purchase of buffaloes. This scheme has
been comparatively successful and is now being extended to other parts of
Nepal.
7.        Socio-economic Unit.  One of the most useful components of the
project is this unit. Despite problems in replacing the original expatriate
head of the unit, it has continued to produce studies that are important
inputs for management decisions.
8.        Soil Conservation and Reafforestation.  These programs are being
successfully implemented on schedule with the establishment of three nurseries
(producing 4,100 man days of employment), 350 ha of reafforestation (8,000 man
days of employment), 200 ha of forest demarcation for protection purposes
(1,500 man days of employment), 70 ha of protective afforestation, road pro-
tection along 12 km of main road (2,500 man days of work) and construction of
stone walling and protection works along 5 km of endangered trails.
9.        Other District Development Programs.  Under the project, it was
intended that LDD would implement a wide range of projects including village
water supplies, minor irrigation schemes, trails, small suspension bridges and
fodder and fuel tree establishment. Most of these were intended to be imple-
mented through the strengthened Public Works wing of the CDO's office, or the
District Technical Office (DTO), in conjunction with staff from Ministry of.
Works and Transport (MOWT) and the Irrigation Department. In practice, each
department has tended to isolate its own activities although LDD have retained
financial responsibility for part of the minor irrigation and suspension
bridge components. These are being implemented by DTO staff from MOWT.
10.       During the course of the project, successive district development
plans have identified a large number of village level projects for implement-
ation by LDD or DTO. Lack of suitably trained junior staff has, to a certain



- 55 -
ANNEX 1
Page 4
extent, delayed the implementation of these projects and, to overcome this
short-fall, a village-level technician training program has recently been
initiated. It is intended that the successful trainees will return to their
villages and assist DTO staff, as and when required, to survey and supervise
the construction of such works as simple buildings, small bridges, irrigation
canals and water supply systems. However, 10 panchayat offices have been
renovated or constructed, 1 assembly hall built, and 72,000 man days of work
provided in track and trail improvement, construction of technical offices
and other buildings, improvement to minor irrigation schemes and construction
of two suspension foot bridges. Twenty village water supplies have been
designed and costed, of which six are now complete.
11.       Irrigation.  Irrigation development under the Project was intended
to be based on a strengthened DTO staffed by officers from the Irrigation
Department the LDD and the MOWT. Administratively, the staff would have
reported to the CDO who would be responsible for all development works carried
out in the District. In practice, however, irrigation activities have tended
to divide between the "large" schemes undertaken by the Irrigation Department
who retain their regionally based organization structure, and the "small"
schemes undertaken by LDD.
12.       The latter organization, because of technical manpower constraints,
have only retained financial responsibiity while all technical and associated
administrative matters are dealt with at the District level. The DTOs, staffed
through the Technical Division of the MOWT, thus have become increasingly
responsible for the implementation of all local construction work including
minor irrigation works.
13.       Increasing local awareness and appreciation of developmental oppor-
tunities have resulted in greatly improved District Development Plans and an
increased desire on the part of local people to be involved in project imple-
mentation at both identification and implementation stages. The program has
resulted so far in completion of the main works associated with the Battar
irrigation scheme (240 ha) and improvements to six minor schemes.
14.       As described above, the responsibility for implementation of irriga-
tion schemes has been divided between the Irrigation Department and the DTO/
LDD organizations. In the case of Rasuwa and Nuwakot Districts, this divi-
sion was determined before the formulation of each year's development plan,
and scheme size was the only deciding criteria.
15.       Schemes undertaken by the Irrigation Department have utilized Nepali
contractors for river and canal structures and, at the request of local pan-
chayats, canal excavation works have become increasingly the responsibility
of local farmers. The smaller village-level schemes are intended to be much
less dependent on imported technology and consequently, the engineering works
have been simplified as much as possible so that all construction can be under-
taken by local labor Generally, some 20% the total project cost is committed
by the farmers benefitting from the irrigation facilities, either in the form
of contributed labor or in cash. Finance for materials and skilled labor is

provided through the CDO's office and construction works are supervised by
staff of the DTO. These arrangements are formalized by agreements entered
into between the CDO's office and the village panchayat represented by the
pradhan panch or panchayat chairman.

Present Cropping Patterns and Crop Details
1.        Cropping Pattern and Area under Crops.  Four distinct cropping
systems are practiced throughout project districts depending on availability
of irrigation, topography and altitude. Details are given in Annex 2
together with crop information. Paddy, wheat, barley, maize and millet
constitute the main crops with potatoes found at higher altitudes.
(a) In the case of Khet land (fully irrigated), the main crop
is paddy, followed generally by winter wheat. Such land
is mostly found at lower altitudes and accounts for about
16% of the total cropped area. Common rotations are:
Cropping Pattern        % of Total Cropped Area
Paddy - Wheat                      11

(b)  Under rainfed farming conditions, which are most common
throughout the project area, maize is the important crop
grown during monsoon months, and is usually followed
by winter wheat or barley or intercropped with millets.
This rotation accounts for 35% of the cropped area:

(c)  As the preferred food of all project farmers is rice, wherever
rainfall and soil conditions permit, upland paddy is grown
instead of maize and is followed generally by winter wheat.
This cropping patterns covers about 29% of the cultivated
area:

3.        Crops.  Given below are some features of the important crops grown:
(a) Paddy. Grown mainly in valleys at lower elevations and up
to an altitude of 2,000 meters where favorable soil and water
conditions exist. Where irrigation is available, nurseries
are raised and transplanting is practised, whereas, under



-59-
ANNEX 2
Page 3
rainfed conditions, both transplanting and broadcasting of
seed occur.  In upland areas, Ghaiyya (local variety) paddy
is grown and which is resistant to drought but gives, how-
ever, low yields. Local paddy varieties are generally grown,
but at lower altitudes. Small acreages of the improved
varieties IR24 and Chainan 242 are now being introduced.
(b) Maize. Always grown under rainfed conditions where paddy
is not possible and in upland areas. Local, short duration
varieties are common. However, some improved varieties are
being tested - Rampur Yellow and Kakani Yellow - but are of
longer duration and may not prove satisfactory under pre-
vailing rainfed conditions.
(c) Finger Millet. Generally grown as an intercrop with maize,
but also in some higher areas in pure stand. 'When grown as
an intercrop, millet is germinated in seed beds and trans-
planted between the rows of maize. Local varieties are gene-
rally planted but yields are low.
(d) Wheat. Grown in winter under residual moisture conditions,
following paddy or maize.  The crop is irrigated wherever
possible. Local varieties are still widely planted and yields
are low. AR21, an improved high yielding variety, is being
cultivated by a few farmers.
(e) Barley. Grown at high altitudes under rainfed conditions,
using residual moisture and yields poorly.
(f) Pulses. During monsoon months pulses are also grown as a
mixed crop. Peas, lentils and gram are grown in winter.
Soyabean is a popular pulse crop.
(g) Mustard. An important winter oilseed crop also grown over
limited areas as a main crop, but mainly as a mixed crop
with wheat and barley.
(h) Potato. This is an important subsidiary food crop grown in
winter. Local varieties are grown with low yields, but
improved Indian varieties are grown successfully in adjacent
areas of Uttar Pradesh.

crop for an owner-cultivator.

Projected Food Balance Sheet for Project Area: 1990
I. Without Project
1. Population: (i) Rates of growth:
Darchula, 1.2% p.a. for 5 years (from 1978); 1.5% for 7 years
(upto and including 1990)
Baitadi, 2.05% p.a. for 5 years; 2.00% for 7 years
Dandeldhura, 2.2% p.a. for 5 years; 2% for 7 years.
Without the project it should be expected that Darchula's population will
continue to decline, mainly through permanent migration, until the prospects
of migration as a solution to the problems of the District diminish (the
result of lack of available land for further settlement). This would raise
the population growth rate in Darchula, but nowhere near the other two dis-
tricts. With increasing population pressure in Baitadi, population growth
rates will gradually decline and should stabilize around 2%. Dandeldhura
should experience the highest growth rate because of land available for
settlement. Available land should become scarce within five years because
of: (a) settlement; (b) more effective measures on the part of HMG to
prevent further settlement in, mainly, presently forested areas.
(ii) Population profile: Assumed to be the same as in
1977.
2. The area of lands leased is assumed to be the same as at present
(i.e., 9.45% overall). Also unchanged are the amounts retained as seed, and
sold/bartered, and tax rates.
3. Rates of conversion/milling, and caloric value: no change.
4. Assumed that cereals and potato will constitute 80% of dietary
requirements, mainly because of shortages of these items.
5. Average subsistence taken at 2,500 cals/ACU/day; minimum subsis-
tence at 2,000 cals/ACU/day.
6. Storage: Loss reduced to 13% because it is assumed that some
better techniques of storage will filter, especially with the extreme shor-
tage of food that will result without project.
II. With Project
1. Population: (i) Rates of growth:
Darchula, 1.5% p.a. for 5 years; 1.8% for 7 years. Greater growth
rate than at present mainly because of project and improved
employment opportunities locally.
Baitadi, 2.1% p.a. for 5 years; 2.0% p.a. for 7 years. Gradual
decline due to increased education, better health facilities,
economic development.

Page 4
Dandeldhura, 2.2% p.a. for 5 years; 2.0% for 7 years.  Minimal
increases during first five years because of land available for
settlement, but lower than without project because of lower
migration rate into the district from more northern districts
(Baitadi and Darchula).
(ii) Population Profile: Same as at present.
2. Rent: Lands leased assumed to increase to 10% (which is 0.55%
higher than at present).
3. Taxes: Assumed to increase as follows: (i) tenant cultivators
to pay 6% of the value of the main crop; (ii) landlords to pay 20% of the
value of the rent received; and (iii) owner cultivators to pay 9% of the
value of the main crop. This increase is comparable with the increases
introduced with the application of PDLTA.
4. Seed retention rate increased to 3%. Although this is not ideal,
it is believed that with improved agricultural practices and better seed,
farmers will retain more seed. Further, increased returns predicted will
also permit higher seed retention.
5. Sale/barter: Reduced to 2%. Reasons for this assumption: (a)
higher monetization as a result of the project; and (b) more sources of
other income receivable in cash.
6. Wastage: Reduced to 10% mainly because of: (i) better storage
facilities; and (ii) dusting with insecticide.
7. Conversion/milling ratios and caloric values remain unchanged.
It is doubtful whether the conversion/milling ratios will improve over the
next 20 years.
8. Assumed that cereals and potato will constitute only 80% of dietary
requirements because of moderate dietary changes due to higher level of
economic development.
9. Average subsistence taken at 2,500 cals/ACU/day; minimum subsis-
tence at 2,000/ACU/day.

APPRAISAL OF SECOND RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT - MAHAKALI HILLS
Basis for Economic Analysis
Official Exchange Rate (OER)
1.        For some years, HMGN has maintained a dual exchange rate, one in
terms of US dollars and the other in terms of Indian rupees. Since March 20,
1978, the rate of exchange has been set at NRs 12.0 to US$1.00, and NRs 1.45
to one Indian rupee. Conversion of border prices has been made at this rate.
Standard Conversion Factor (SCF)
2.        Tariff and trade restrictions introduce a distortion in the price
relationships between traded goods (valued at market prices), and non-traded
goods (valued at local prices). The benefits of the project are evaluated
at world market prices. In order to make the cost comparable to the bene-
fits, a SCF is applied to the price of non-traded goods and consumption.
In the absence of trade restrictions, the SCF can be approximately calculated
using the formula:
SCF      + M    1/
X +Sx +M +Tm -Tx           1
3.        On the basis of official trade data in 1974/75, 1975/76 and 1976/77,
this calculation gives an SCF of 0.95 which is consistent with a shadow ex-
change rate of NRs 12.6 to US$1. However, since this estimate does not take
into consideration quantitative restriction, it provides only an upper limit
for the SCF. On the other hand, HMGN has also encouraged exports through an
export incentive exchange rate of NRs 16 to US$1. This is consistent to a
SCF = 0.75. Because of the approximate nature of this estimate, a SCF = 0.9
has been used for the economic analysis. In order to take into account the
error in estimating SCF, a sensitivity analysis has been performed (Chapter 9).
Foodgrains Conversion Factor (FCF)
4.         The FCF is applied to the financial prices of the non-traded goods
in agricultural sector to express them in economic terms. The FCF can be
estimated with the following formula:
1/   X:  export, M:  import, Sx:  export subsidies, Tm:  import duties,
Tx: export taxes.



ANNEX 4
Page 2
FCP = Qrice x PErice + Qwheat x PEwheat + Qmaize x PEmaize
Qrice x PFrice x Qwheat x PFwheat + Qmaize x PFmaize
where     Q  =  total production in Nepal
PE  =  economic price
PF  =  financial price
5.        In theory, all traded foodgrains should be included in the formula.
However, since rice, maize and wheat account for 95% of Nepal's foodgrain pro-
duction, this formula is accurate enough for all practical purposes. This
gives a FCF = 1.30.
Prices of Agricultural Outputs
6.        The economic prices for traded goods such as rice, wheat, maize and
groundnuts are based on their border prices at the OFR. The domestic cost
component (i.e. local transport and marketing charges) are adjusted by the
SCF of 0.90. Since the historical financial price ratio is not available for
the project area, the FCF is applied to the prevailing financial prices of
non-traded food crops such as pulses, millet, potato and vegetables. Oil
crops are assumed traded, their economic prices are derived from the projected
world market price of rapeseeds. In principle, conversion factors would have
to be derived for other products such as milk, manure, wool and meat. However,
in view of the scarcity of data, economic prices of these products are derived
by applying the SCF to their prevailing financial prices. Economic prices are
presented in Annex 4, Table 1.
Prices of Agricultural Inputs
7.        Farm Labor.  During the peak agricultural months, the opportunity
cost of labor is equal to the market wage rate. At minimum employment levels,
the marginal cost of labor would be the value of additional consumption needed
to undertake field works (estimated at NRs 1.5 per man day). 1/ During the
slack months, the opportunity cost of labor would be the alternative earnings
in other non-agricultural activities such as porterage and construction labor,
or in gathering fuelwood, fodder and household works (estimated at NRs 5.0 per
man day). 2/ On the basis of labor requirements for various crops and the
cropping pattern in the project area, the following weights are assigned to
various levels of opportunity cost of labor:
1/   An adult needs an equivalent of 0.5 kg cereals (comprising 50% maize and
50% rice) per day for his minimum subsistence need of 2,000 calories per
day. The economic prices of rice and maize are NRs 3.96 and NRs 2.19 per
kg, respectively.
2/   Assuming 50% of the labor force would be involved in porterage and con-
struction works during the slack months, earning on average NRs 7.5 per
man day, and 50% in gathering fuelwood, winter fodder or household works
(estimated at NRs 2.5 per day).

Minimum employment            25                   1.5
Weighted Average                             4.9
Economic opportunity cost of labor is derived by applying SCF to the oppor-
tunity cost of labor, estimated at NRs 4.4 per man day, or about 70% of the
economic market wage rate (NRs 6.3 per man day).
8.        Draft Animals.  It is assumed that the opportunity cost of draft
animals would be equal to the rental charges, estimated at NRs 15 per pair
per day. This financial price is multiplied by the SCF to express the oppor-
tunity cost of draft animals in economic terms.
9.        Other Inputs.  Fertilizers have been valued at the projected world
market price. Pesticides and insecticides have been assumed to be traded.
Taxes are levied at 2%. Subsidies are given in terms of lump sum grant to
the AIC who is responsible for distributing all agricultural inputs. In view
of the difficulty in rationing the subsidy amount to pesticides and insecti-
cides, it is assumed that taxes and subsidies would be approximately equal.
Consequently, their economic prices are equal to their financial prices.
Economic prices of seeds are derived by applying the ratio of economic and
financial prices of relevant crops to the prevailing financial prices of
seeds.
Construction Conversion Factor (CCF)
10.       Construction of project buildings is carried out using simple
equipment, local materials and skilled and unskilled labor. For the economic
analysis, the construction conversion factor is estimated as follows:
(a)  Traded Component.  This component includes capital intensive
works which require imported materials. Since it is traded,
the conversion factor is 1.00. It is estimated that about
10% of the construction costs fall under this category.
(b)  Non-traded Component.  This component includes works that
require skill labor and locally manufactured materials.
The SCF of 0.9 is used as the conversion factor for these
works. About 35% of construction costs are included in this
category.

(c)  Unskilled Labor.  The analysis of shadow wage rates for
unskilled labor is given in para 7.  The conversion factor
of 0.70 has been applied to about 55% of construction costs
which fall under this category:
Conversion Factor
Traded Items                                    1.0
Non-traded Items                                0.9
Unskilled Labor                                 0.8
