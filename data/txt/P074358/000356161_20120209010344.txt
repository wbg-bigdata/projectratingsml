1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.        The Social Protection Implementation Project was approved on May 13,
2004. The Loan Agreement was signed on July 25, 2004 and became effective on
September 1, 2004. The Project built on the Government’s social protection and pension
reform efforts, supported by World Bank-financed investment and development policy
lending operations. The project was also expected to support the Government in meeting
the policy conditionalities of the Public Sector Management Adjustment Loan (PSMAL),
the adjustment operation prepared in parallel with the Project.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

2.        The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYR Macedonia) was
among the economically least developed of the former Yugoslav republics. Although
its economy contracted even further in the years immediately following independence in
1991, the country made significant progress in macroeconomic stabilization and
structural reforms during the 1995-1999 period. In that period, the economy experienced
an average annual positive GDP growth rate of 2.9 percent, inflation was reduced to 2.2
percent, and fiscal deficit declined to 0.2 percent. These positive trends were interrupted
by the Kosovo crisis (in 1999) and civil conflicts (in 2001) that resulted in a significant
decline of industrial production and a severe deterioration of the fiscal balance.
3.         At the time of appraisal in 2004, economic growth had slowed and
investment was sluggish. The fiscal deficit of the general budget rose to 5.7 percent of
GDP due to a significant increase in security-related expenditures, larger transfers to
social funds, new public sector hiring, higher public wages and exceptional financing to
compensate losses suffered in the wake of failed Ponzi schemes Although real GDP grew
by 3.1 percent in 2003, significant challenges remained to achieve macroeconomic
stability, a functioning market economy, sustained growth, and ultimately higher living
standards for the people of FYR Macedonia.
4.       At the time of appraisal, social assistance was characterized by weak
administrative capacity and a complex and fragmented system of social cash
benefits. Social transfers1 at around 12.5 percent of GDP for most of the first half of the
2000s, before falling to about 11 percent in 2005, were modest compared to the South
East Europe average of around 14 percent of GDP. 2 The system had developed in a
piecemeal fashion, with little consideration given to linkages between programs or
administrative efficiency. By 2002, there were as many as 0.5 million people (25 percent

of the population) living in families that received some form of social assistance benefits.
The efficiency and the effectiveness of those programs, however, remained low:
programs were not well targeted; inclusion and exclusion errors were high. The 2005
Poverty Assessment found that social transfers were responsible for reducing the poverty
headcount from 35 to 22 percent of population in 2003; it also found, however, that social
assistance programs provided greater coverage to the non poor than to the poor3. The
assessment also found that even though the Government was making efforts to improve
targeting efficiency of the means-tested social assistance program, these efforts were
hampered by inadequate benefit administration and delivery, lack of proper monitoring of
eligibility, and limited incentives for the beneficiaries to leave the system.
5.        The pension system also needed reform. In 2002, total pension expenditures
were 10.8 percent of GDP, and the Pension and Disability Insurance Fund (PDIF)
required budget transfers of approximately 3 percent of GDP in addition to its direct
contribution revenues. Moreover, the structural deficit of the PDIF was expected to grow
in the future as a result of worsening system dependency ratios, generous benefit
assessment and indexation rules, as well as the relatively easy access to occupational
early retirement and disability status. To address these issues, the Government embarked
on a comprehensive reform of the pension system. The reform included parametric
policy changes, along with efforts to improve administration through improved system of
contribution collection, record-keeping and internal controls, and strengthening of
institutional capacity in the areas of strategic planning, business process development,
human resource management and communication. In addition to the parametric
adjustments to the public pension system, legislation was passed in 2000 to implement a
structural reform introducing a mandatory funded (“second?) pension pillar. This pillar
was designed to be mandatory for new entrants to the labor market and to be voluntary
for persons who were already in the workforce. The implementation of a two-pillar
system faced a number of significant challenges including creating the fiscal space
necessary to accommodate the transitional deficit, creating adequate financial instruments
for investment of the accumulated assets, and ensuring that the institutional framework
established would be both cost-effective and consistent with sound governance principles
and long-term financial return objectives.
6.       The World Bank 2003-2006 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) included
three development objectives of direct relevance to this operation: (i) support to the
public sector management reform program, (ii) building human capital, and (iii)
protecting the most vulnerable. The CAS noted as important elements the need for
“improving the efficiency, effectiveness, quality of services and coordination of major
social protection programs, including pensions?, further “institutional strengthening of

 While in 2002 the social assistance transfers were received by 47 percent of non-poor beneficiaries, and
by 53 percent of poor, in 2003 this ratio worsened with transfers were received by 51.2 percent non-poor
and by 48.8 percent poor beneficiaries. Poor are people who are in the lowest income group (in the lowest
quintile).

major institutions of the pension system? and “reforming the social safety net which had
been lacking coordination at the system level.?4
7.        The preparation and the design of the new investment operation – the
Social Protection Implementation Project - built on the achievements of the previous
reform efforts of the Government in the areas of public sector management and social
protection. Prior to the approval of the Project, the World Bank had supported FYR
Macedonia by providing technical advice through several World Bank-financed
investment projects as well as through adjustment (development policy) lending and
Analytical and Advisory Activities5. The project was expected to assist the Government
in finalization of the social policy reform agenda supported under the PSMAL, the
adjustment operation prepared in parallel with the Project.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

8.        The development objectives of the Project were to improve the effectiveness
and efficiency of the social protection system through improved administration and
long-term sustainability of the pension system and improved targeting and
administration of cash benefits. The development objectives as well as the performance
indicators were the same across the main text of the PAD, Annex 3 of the Project
Appraisal Document (PAD) (Results Framework and Arrangements for Results
Monitoring) and the Financial Agreement. However, for regular monitoring, a subset of
different indicators was selected and tracked in the Implementation Status and Results
Reports (ISR). The indicators used for the purpose of this ICR are those used in the ISRs.

9.         A full review of the Project documentation revealed that there was a minor
discrepancy between the PDO as set out in the PAD and the PDO in the Loan
Agreement: the term targeting was consistently referred to in the PAD, but was missing
from the Loan agreement. The latter was identified during the December 2008 full review
of the Project’s documentation and was documented in the Sector Manager’s comments
filed in the Project’s ISR no. 8, archived on December 24, 2008.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

10.      The Project Development Objective was not revised. The PDIs were not
formally revised, but they are stated differently in the PAD Annex 3 (Results Framework
and Arrangements for Results Monitoring) and the ISRs.

11.        In the Social Assistance component (Component 2), the intermediate
indicators described in the PAD and intended for tracking the achievement of the
PDO were not monitored during implementation - instead, a subset of indicators was
selected for regular monitoring in the ISR. Although this practice was common at the
time, it remained an obstacle for monitoring performance and assessing final results. The
detailed findings linked to the adjustments made and the ICR team’s assessments are
elaborated in section 2.3 - Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

12.      The direct beneficiaries of the Project under the Pension Administration
component included the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy (MLSP), PDIF and its
branch offices, the private pension sector's regulatory agency Macedonian Agency for
Supervision of the Capitally Funded Pension Insurance (MAPAS), and the National
Bank.

13.      Under the Social Assistance component, the investments targeted a number of
specific departments/units at MLSP such as the Social Protection Department, Child
Protection Department, IT Department, Policy Evaluation Unit, Financial Department,
Social Inspection Department, and the social welfare centers (SWCs).

14.      In addition, the ultimate project beneficiaries were the households at the bottom
of the income distribution and future pensioners. Taxpayers - through improved
compliance and recordkeeping - would also enjoy the benefits of a more stable pension
system, which would require fewer ad-hoc revenue or expenditure side adjustments to
maintain its fiscal sustainability.

1.5 Original Components

15.      The Project included three components: (i) Pension System Administration
(hereinafter referred to as the Pension Administration component); (ii) Social Protection
Program Support (hereinafter referred to as the Social Assistance component); and (iii)
Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation.


COMPONENT 1: PENSION SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION (US$ 7.99 million)
16.      This component aimed at improving the long-term sustainability of the
pension system through improving the administration and efficiency of the existing
pension system institutions; increasing the efficiency and effectiveness in collection of
pension contributions through the introduction of monthly pension contribution record-
keeping on the individual basis; building regulatory and supervisory capacities in the
newly formed MAPAS agency and custodial capacities in the National Bank of the
Republic of Macedonia (NBRM); and improving public knowledge of the pension system
through an extensive public education campaign.
17.     Sub-component 1: Governance and management reform in the PDIF through
implementation of sound business plans/processes and improved financial management


                                            4
practices, improved human resource management, development and implementation of
internal and external communication strategy for the PDIF, as well as strengthening
policy and actuarial analysis capacities in the PDIF. It also supported the design and the
implementation of an improved pension contribution collection system and the
introduction of individual accounts for pension contributors.

18.       Sub-component 2: MAPAS Development of: (i) the regulatory framework
needed for proper functioning of the funded pension system; (ii) the design and
implementation of the MAPAS business processes and MAPAS capacity building; and
(iii) enhancement of public understanding of the funded pension system.

19.      Sub-component 3: Capacity Building at MLSP for Pension System Analysis,
Policy Development and Public Education, including: (i) identification of policy options
and preparation of draft pension legislation; (ii) capacity building for pension system
analysis and the development of future policy options; and the (iii) preparation and
implementation of the integrated pension reform public education campaign, including
organization of training, workshops and seminars, printing and distribution of the
education materials, and other activities as needed.

20.       Sub-component 4: Pension system custody (of second pillar pension assets)
capacity development at the NBRM in: (i) identification of business processes and
adequate organizational structure for the development of Custodial Department; (ii)
preparation of rules and regulations related to custody over the second pillar pension
assets, their evaluation, record-keeping and other custody-related activities; and (iii)
provision of specialized training of the Custody Department staff on the issues relevant to
the Department’s activities.


COMPONENT 2: SOCIAL PROTECTION PROGRAM SUPPORT (US$ 2.58
million)

21.     This component supported the implementation of social assistance reforms
and the development of technical and organizational capacities for policy
formulation and mechanisms to improve resource management and service delivery
in the MLSP and its strategy departments.

22.      Sub-component 1: Policy framework for streamlined, cost effective and better
targeted cash benefits, implementation of local social planning and deinstitutionalization
of social work services, and establishment of inspection, supervision and quality
assurance functions. In particular, the sub-component was aimed at supporting the
formulation of social assistance policy; models for the decentralized management of
social protection, interface between the cash benefit regime and labor market measures
managed by the National Employment Bureau (NEB); design of technical and
organizational options for reform and the formulation of operational structures for
monitoring and reviewing cash benefits and social work services; and establishment of a
consolidated inspection and quality assurance function.



                                            5
23.       Subcomponent 2: Information management systems and IT capacity
strengthening of the institutions and departments in charge of administration of cash
benefits, the delivery of social services and the interface between cash benefits managed
by SWCs and active employment measures managed by the NEB. The sub-component
was designed to ensure support for the design and implementation of business
plans/processes related to the development of integrated system for administration of
social protection programs; harmonization of data systems across key institutions and the
development of IT data transfer systems and communication links between the MLSP
and other institutions within the social protection system, including data protection and
security system upgrade of the equipment and data communications networks; as well as
training on sound information management practices and communication and information
technology development.


COMPONENT 3: PROJECT MANAGEMENT, MONITORING AND
EVALUATION (US$ 0.51 million)
24.      This component ensured effective administration and implementation of
the project by supporting the operations of a Project Management Unit (PMU) which
reported to the Minister of Labor and which was responsible for all the day-to-day
project implementation activities, including procurement, disbursement, and accounting
functions.
25.       The Policy Unit in the MLSP and the PMU were jointly tasked with
ensuring the effective monitoring and evaluation of project activities, achievements
and outcomes during and after project implementation. The Policy Unit originally
was staffed with two full-time staff and the project was aimed at supporting capacity
building of this Unit through Government financing of one more full-time staff and
through World Bank financing of two additional staff for an initial period of two years, to
be transferred in mid-2006 to the Government budget.

1.6 Revised Components
26.       Project components were not revised. There were, however, several
reallocations of the Loan proceeds among the Project sub-components which are
mentioned in the Section 1.7 below.

1.7 Other significant changes
27.        There were two amendments to the Loan agreement:
         The first amendment, approved on January 26, 2009, extended the Loan’s Closing
          Date by twelve months to June 30, 2010. The extension was approved to allow
          the Borrower to complete the development of the software for: (i) the Pension
          Payout, (ii) Financial Management Information System and Document
          Management System for the PDIF; (iii) core business functions of the MAPAS;
          (iv) the Cash Benefit MIS. It also allowed the procurement of IT hardware for the
          MLSP and the SWCs, and the networking equipment for establishing the linkages
          among the MLSP, SWCs, Employment Agency, and the PDIF. In addition,
          Schedule 1 of the Loan agreement was amended to reflect the reallocation of the


                                              6
       Loan proceeds within categories of expenditures, including increase in goods and
       consultant services, and reduction in training and incremental operational costs.
      The second amendment, approved on June 15, 2010, extended the Closing Date of
       the Loan by a further eleven months to May 31, 2011, to allow completion of the
       two critical software packages, (i) the Pension Payout software, and (ii) the
       software solutions for the Cash Benefit MIS, which were essential for the full
       accomplishment of the PDO. The amendment also included increasing the
       disbursement percentage of eligible expenditures to 100% due to the difficulties
       encountered by the Ministry of Finance to provide timely counterpart funds
       contribution to some activities; and reallocation of funds within categories
       including increase in goods and consultants services and reduction in training.
       The disbursement percentage for the incremental operating costs was not changed
       and it remained 25% from the World Bank Loan proceeds and 75% from the
       Government contribution.
28.      The restructuring did not involve the introduction of new activities, or
revisions of the project development objectives, outcomes, design, or scope.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

Soundness of background analysis
29.       The Project preparation and Project’s design including its objectives and
defined components were based on extensive research, studies and policy discussions
between the World Bank and the Government which took place over several years
preceding the Project approval. The goals and means of the project reflected
international best practice as adapted to local circumstances. The background analysis,
used as a critical input into the Project’s preparation, was grounded in the previous policy
and technical assistance work supported by the Social Sector Adjustment Credit (SSAC),
the Pension Reform Technical Assistance Project (PERTAP) and the Public Sector
Management Adjustment Credit (PSMAC).
30.       The support provided through the PERTAP was a critical factor which led
to impressive achievements in the implementation of successive governments’
pension reform agenda. The PSMAC, as a one tranche operation, supported the
medium-term strategy of the Government in public sector management, including the
fiscal sustainability of the pension system. Other parallel analytical work and technical
evidence came out of the assessments prepared by the World Bank Financial Sector
Assessment Program team in 2003 which addressed issues related to the Macedonian
financial markets as one of the key requirements for the implementation of the new
pension system and the introduction of the second pension pillar.
31.       The Project initially envisaged inclusion of reforms in social protection and
health. While the reforms in both sectors were perceived important, they were at
different stages of preparation, and this was seen as a major challenge for successful


                                             7
preparation of the Project. The team, therefore, decided to seek guidance through a
Quality Enhancement Review (QER). The QER was carried out on July 16, 2003. The
QER commended the two sectoral teams for the decision to seek their guidance at an
early stage of project preparation and highlighted the substantial risks associated with
preparation and implementation of such a complex project. The QER proposed three
alternatives: (i) a human development (HD) policy/adjustment loan in support of the
second phase of the Public Sector Management Adjustment Loan (PSMAL); (ii) an HD
investment loan focused on the introduction and application of modern information
systems in social protection and health; and (iii) separation of the two sectoral
components into two different operations: a social protection investment loan, focusing
on information systems with linked technical assistance (TA); and a multi-sectoral
(including health TA activities) TA loan linked to PSMAL II. Subsequently to the QER,
at the Project Concept Note (PCN) Review meeting of October 7, 2003, the decision was
taken to split the Project into two separate health and social protection projects. The total
financing allocated for the joint project was divided between the two projects providing
US$7.5 million the Social Protection Implementation Loan (SPIL). Since this amount
could not cover all the activities that the Government was planning to implement in the
areas of pensions and social protection, the World Bank management and the
Government agreed to increase the loan amount to US$9.8 million.


Quality of design
32.        The Project preparation was supported by a Policy and Human Resource
Development (PHRD) grant in an amount of US$397,320. The Grant financing
allowed the team to contract high level experts who engaged in pension policy review
and research, short-term and long-term pension system modeling, pension system
administration, review of the available technical support and information and
communication systems, development and staff training, etc. Social protection specialists
were hired to help the Government to fix the multiple inconsistencies between the
different databases used in the process of administration of the cash benefits, defining the
eligibility criteria for the benefits which existed at that time, etc. Their outputs, reports
and recommendations were based on the thorough review of the system of social
protection benefits supported by the available statistics at that time and the related
institutional, legal and regulatory framework. The Project’s design succeeded in
capturing the main issues and problems confronted by the Government to ensure
improved performance of its functions in delivering programs and services in pensions
and social assistance/welfare areas. The choice and definition of the indicators, though,
did generate some issues around the design of the Project’s results framework that are
discussed in section 2.3 of this Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR).
33.      Alignment of the Project’s design with the CAS (2003-2006): the Project
design and specifically its PDO reflected one of the development objectives of the CAS
which called for “improving the efficiency, effectiveness, quality of services and
coordination of major social protection programs, including pensions? and required
further “institutional strengthening of major institutions of the pension system? and
“reforming the social safety net which had been lacking coordination at the system level?.



                                             8
34.      The Government was initially interested in a Project designed to reflect
only the pension system reform requirements. Nevertheless, growing awareness about
the need for initiation of social assistance cash benefit reforms led to inclusion of a social
assistance dimension into the PDO. The Project’s design ultimately reflected both
dimensions, the pension and the social assistance, with attention initially, at the design
stage, given to the Pension Administration component, at the expense of the Social
Assistance component.
35.     The design of the Pension Administration component followed a detailed
road map of pension reform activities and related milestones, the so called Critical
Path Analysis. The Project team used this as a management and supervision instrument
throughout the Pension component preparation and also later during the component
implementation.
36.       The design of the Pension Administration component reflected properly the
needs of the pension system. Administrative improvements were needed to support the
already enacted parametric reforms and the planned structural reforms, i.e., the
introduction of mandatory and voluntary fully funded pension pillars. Along with the
development of a legislative framework for the funded pillars, the Project was to support
design and development of a new system of collection of contributions and record-
keeping by the PDIF ahead of the introduction of the second fully funded pension pillar.
Governance and management reforms aimed to improve collection performance and
financial management at the PDIF required subsequent changes. The latter entailed
reforms in PDF’s accounting, budgeting and internal controls in compliance with
international standards and revisions to the pension legislation.
37.      The Project design also reflected appropriately the high priority needs of
the Government to confront effectively the abuse of the disability pensions; thus the
design included work on the disability insurance system modifications. Furthermore, the
new second pillar legislation required strengthened regulatory capacity of the newly
introduced institutions (such as Pension Supervision Agency) and further elaboration of
the mechanics of the second pillar, including custodial functions, development of
necessary rules and regulations, continued public education, etc., as well as a plan for
financing transition costs, a wider range of investment instruments available for pension
funds, etc. Lastly, the public education campaigns at different stages of Project
implementation were planned to ensure that the public is well aware of the pension
system reforms. The design of the Project reflected all these priorities accordingly.
38.       In the Social Assistance component, too, the most serious challenges were
identified and reflected adequately in the design of this component. These challenges
included a complex set of issues related to tightening the benefits eligibility for improved
targeting, reforms in the benefits administration and establishment of vertical and
horizontal interfaces between the MLSP and the SWCs, and the MLSP and other key
institutions in the system such as PDIF, Employment Office, Health Insurance Fund
(HIF), Tax Office, etc. It also included reforms in the legal and regulatory framework
governing the child benefits, improving inspection and quality assurance functions of the
MLSP, improving the interface between the social assistance benefits and monitoring the
employment status of beneficiaries, etc.



                                              9
39.      Notwithstanding the solid preparatory work on the design of this Project
component, and the comprehensive approach to the social safety net reform, the
ICR team assesses the design of this component as rather ambitious, from both
design and implementation aspects. An issue which should have been better
understood at the time of Project design was the considerable institutional capacity
constraints faced by the Government. While the MLSP Pension team and the institutions
of the pension system were relatively better staffed and had already gained experience in
the system reform, the capacity of the MLSP social assistance team at that time was
rather modest. It could not have been realistically expected that capacity constraints
would disappear given the scarcity of trained specialists and financial constraints which
limit government agencies' ability to attract experts. This design shortcoming haunted
the project during its implementation and is largely to blame for the underperformance of
the Social Assistance component.


Lessons learned
40.       The following lessons learned from previous operations were incorporated
into the design of the Project: (i) the need for strong Government ownership and
subsequent involvement of the respective Government agencies in the Project
implementation; this played a crucial role in ensuring the Project’s success and
sustainability; (ii) the need for realism and flexibility of the implementation timetable
supported by project management instruments such as a detailed critical path analysis;
(iii) paying due attention and respect to the political economy of the planned pension and
social assistance reforms through incorporating and executing public education
campaigns; (iv) adherence to the parametric reforms in the pension system preceding the
Project and development and application of subsequent pension modeling tools used for
identification of the next generation of the pension system reform; (v) completion and
operational readiness of the Project implementation arrangements during the Project
preparation which ensured that implementation could start with no delays.


Risk assessment
41.      Most of the risks were well identified, and the subsequent mitigation
measures were adequate. Nevertheless, the risk related to the Information Technology
capacities of the client agencies to effectively design, procure and implement IT software
solutions was under-rated. In this context, World Bank experience with IT procurement
suggests that the length of time needed for implementation of the Project was also under-
estimated. Likewise, the capacity constraints, reflected in the lack of full understanding
of the complexity of the social protection policy actions and interventions financed
through the Project, were underestimated.

2.2 Implementation
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
42.      Overall, the Project was successful in delivering most of the outputs
anticipated under the Project’s components, particularly in the case of the Pension


                                           10
component. The delays in implementation which led to two extensions of the Project’s
closing date by 23 months were partially resolved, with both dimensions of the PDO
successfully achieved.
43.       The Project’s ISRs rated the quality of implementation either Highly
Satisfactory or Satisfactory. The only time when both the progress towards
achievement of the PDO and the overall implementation progress were rated Moderately
Satisfactory, was when the likelihood of achieving the PDO indicator of improving the
targeting of social assistance was put at risk by the need to re-tender the selection of the
developer for the strategically important Cash Benefit Management Information System
(CB MIS) software. The contract with the first supplier for the CB MIS, after two
extensions, was terminated in March 2010 in spite of the fact that the original contract
completion date was November 15, 2009. The contract was terminated due to incapacity
of the contractor to finish the work. The second attempt for the selection of the system
developer that took place in May 2010 failed. Only the third selection was successful.
Timely identification of procurement problems by the team, appropriate team’s advice to
the Government and subsequent actions taken by the Government reduced the risk of
repeated problems with the third round of bidding and allowed for the selection of a
contractor for the task. Nevertheless, the delays caused by the first two failed
procurement attempts could not be fully compensated. The Cash Benefit MIS software
could be neither completed nor tested prior to the Project closing date. The World Bank
team and the Government agreed to transfer the remaining unfinished contractual
obligations for the completion of the Cash Benefit MIS software to the new related
investment operation – the Conditional Cash Transfer Project (CCTP). Fortunately, soon
after the closing of the SPIL Project the CB MIS was operationally accepted. The CB
MIS is soon expected to start to deliver the anticipated outcomes related to improved
administration efficiency and, ultimately, improved targeting of the cash benefits.
Factors that positively influenced implementation
44.       One positive factor was the strength of the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) managed by a Project Director who was a senior and experienced official of
the MLSP. The PIU was the successor of the SPIL Project Preparation Unit with staff
hired to ensure adequate preparation of the necessary project documents for the
procurement of goods and services for the first year of the project so that project
implementation could begin without any delay. With the Project of high strategic priority
and strong government ownership, and the Project director and PIU with a good track
record, the Project was able to get off to a strong start.
45.       The effective implementation arrangements were reinforced by several
additional structures established as standing working bodies representative of
decision makers and other participating institutions in Project implementation,
including: (i) Steering Committee for Pension Reform, which provided leadership and
facilitated the cross-sectoral activities necessary for the successful implementation of the
pension reform; (ii) Pension Reform Working Group, consisting of representatives of the
MLSP, Ministry of Finance, NBRM and directors of the PDIF, MAPAS, and the PIU
Pension Coordinator; and in later stages of Project implementation unit; (iii) Social
Protection Working Group consisting of representatives of various MLSP departments
and representatives of the Ministry of Finance and the State Statistics Office (SSO),


                                            11
directors of the Employment Agency and Institute for Social Activities. The meetings of
the working groups were devoted to assisting the PIU in implementation of different
stages of contract management; in particular the working groups would review, comment
and clear terms of reference for new upcoming tasks or review deliverables from ongoing
tasks or tasks under completion, and the meeting notes were shared regularly with the
World Bank team. Although, according to some ISRs, the meetings of the working
groups were not that frequent throughout the lifetime of the Project, they remained a good
instrument by which the Government extended its direct support to Project
implementation.

Factors that impeded implementation
46.       Both Project components involved policy work and ensuing legislative
action. For this purpose, technical assistance of international and local consultants was
sought and, consequently, hired. In the case of the Pension Administration component,
this work proceeded smoothly without any implementation delays. Within the Social
Assistance component, implementation of technical assistance activities as inputs into
legislative action required intensive efforts on the World Bank team’s and the
Government’s side to ensure selection of the most optimal policy options and their
translation into legislative action under a required timeframe. However, institutional
capacity constraints in the MLSP delayed implementation. Eventually, the new Law on
Social Protection was adopted with a twelve months delay.
47.       The Project components also had a heavy focus on development of new
business processes, software development to support these new processes and
procurement and installation of IT hardware for their implementation. Some of
these complex interventions hampered the Project implementation and led to delays
which ultimately had to be resolved by allowing more time for implementation and
extension of the closing date. In the case of the first large tender aimed at procuring a
supplier to develop the Cash Benefits MIS, the originally selected company failed to
deliver the software. The MLSP, terminated the contract with that supplier and made a
decision to re-launch a new bid. The new invitation for bids was announced on May 21,
2010. The second ICB, however, ended with an attempt of misrepresentation of
information in the process of the bid evaluation. This was revealed by the World Bank
team and immediate corrective actions were taken while the case was reported to the
World Bank’s Integrity department. These delays required two extensions of the closing
date of 23 months and the transfer of the remaining tasks for the completion and
operationalization of the Cash Benefits MIS from the SPIL to the CCTP project.
48.      In summary, while the implementation difficulties due to procurement and
capacity constraints adversely affected implementation, there was continuously
strong commitment at the top level of successive governments, at the level of the lead
line ministry, the MLSP, and the Project Director and the PIU to facilitate
communications among the various institutions and other actors and to implement the
reform program.

Design
49.       In general, the Project indicators were relevant and measurable. The PAD
included a comprehensive set of PDO and intermediate outcome indicators. However, as
discussed below, several outcome indicators did not reflect well the PDO and project
components.       For example, for measuring the achievements of the Pension
Administration component, the Project established both quantitative and qualitative
indicators. Some indicators - such as the number of employees trained in using actuarial
models or the number of MAPAS employees trained in supervisory practices - are quasi-
quantitative: the exact numeric targets are presented as evidence of delivery of project
objectives, but there were no explanations in the PAD or the ISRs as to why the selected
target values would indicate that the objectives were substantially met.
50.       The outcome indicators selected for the pension part of the PDO - improved
effectiveness and efficiency of the social protection system through improved
administration and long-term sustainability of the pension system - were not entirely
appropriate for translating the PDO into relevant and measurable outcomes.
51.      In terms of effectiveness (improved administration of the pension system), the
interim result indicators (disability assessment costs, benefit assessment processing
times) adequately measure some facets of the system's administrative performance, but
were insufficient to measure all aspects of efficiency.
52.       The indicator "increased number of pension benefit requests processed within
30 days" is appropriate and measurable. At the same time, the target value attached to the
indicator (90%) did not take into account that awarding disability pensions is a long
process and obtaining records from other ex-Yugoslav republics remains time-
consuming, lengthening average processing times as long as people with cross-country
service histories continue retiring. As confirmed by the client, the indicator was reported
on the basis of old age pensions and survivor pensions only, and only for cases where all
documents were readily available. This approach is viewed as appropriate, as it filters
out factors external to PDIF. Meeting the target for this group is an important
achievement.
53.        It is unclear what information the intermediate outcome indicator "reduced
overall administrative cost of the disability assessment procedure" was supposed to
provide in relation to the effectiveness or efficiency of the disability assessment system.
The disability assessment system was ineffective largely because it failed to filter out
fraudulent uptake, but reducing administrative costs has little indicative value as to the
reliability of the assessment regime or the quality of regulations. In terms of disability,
the indicator which could have measured progress is the change in disability uptake as a
percentage of relevant demographic strata. If the inflow of new beneficiaries could be
curtailed through policy and administrative reforms, the actual cost of administration
becomes secondary. It must also be noted that data on this indicator was not compiled by
the PDIF and was not monitored during Project implementation. In the ISRs there is no
indication that this issue was addressed during supervision missions.




                                            13
54.       Regarding the achievement of the pension part of the PDO, the indicator "the
numbers of MAPAS staff trained in supervisory practices and of MLSP, MAPAS, PDIF
staff trained in operating actuarial models," was chosen as a proxy for improved
effectiveness. It is unclear what the optimal number of trained personnel would be and
whether a small shortfall compared to the target value would be a sign of failure. What is
important is that these institutions are able to perform the functions described in the PAD
- in other words, the indicators should measure output (for example actuarial reports and
analyses, on-site supervision and supervision reports per annum) which would be
achieved through these inputs (staff trained).
55.      The outcome indicator "improved financial solvency of the pension system" is a
much narrower concept than sustainability: whereas the solvency of a public pension
scheme is important from the perspective of annual deficits, in itself it reveals little about
the overall financial position of a system. Indeed, it is possible to improve the solvency
of a pension scheme, in the short to medium run, and worsen its sustainability at the same
time. For this reason - and also to foster the usage of more relevant fiscal indicators
(such as the system's unfunded liabilities) - complementing this flow indicator with a
balance sheet indicator may have better measured the policy objective of improving the
public pension scheme's sustainability.
56.      For the social assistance part of the PDO - improved effectiveness and
efficiency of the social protection system through improved targeting and
administration of cash benefits – the quantitative and qualitative outcome indicators
chosen provided an appropriate framework for monitoring the progress and
measuring outcomes; they were both relevant and measurable.
57.       In relation to targeting, the quantitative outcome indicator for the PDO,
increased share of Social Assistance expenditure going to the bottom two deciles (bottom
quintile) by at least 3%, has been consistently monitored in the ISRs starting from the
sixth ISR onwards.
58.      For the quantitative intermediate results indicator (IRI) – increased number of
social assistance beneficiaries in the lowest deciles, the target value was at least 5%
increase of the SA beneficiaries in the bottom quintile. While the target value was
expressed in quintiles, data was received in deciles, although this did not hinder
monitoring outcomes.
59.        The largest portion of the social assistance part of the results framework in the
PAD consisted of qualitative indicators relating to the administration part of the PDO, for
which the data were not collected due to their initial unavailability but also due to the
initial relatively lower priority attached to the Social Assistance component activities in
the early stages of Project implementation. The qualitative indicators were observable
and measurable. If used, they could have established the causal links between the
Project’s inputs, activities, outputs, and intended outcomes. These untracked qualitative
indicators would have tracked and shown the degree of readiness and (near) completion
of the unified Cash Benefits MIS (CB MIS) as one of the main deliverables attributable to
the interventions financed under the Social Assistance component.
60.      One quantifiable and measurable interim indicator, the reduction of social
worker time spent on social benefits administration, was introduced into the ISR results


                                             14
framework at the time of the Mid-Term Review, which took place in February 2007, with
a view to measure the impact of the introduction of the new unified CB MIS and the
centralized data registry on administrative efficiency. However, no study was conducted
to set the baseline and the target value of the indicator. The actual value of this indicator
would become evident only after the CB MIS becomes fully functional, expected to take
place beyond the lifetime of this Project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Financial management
Rating: Satisfactory
61.      Financial management arrangements were Satisfactory throughout most of
the implementation period. Audit opinions on annual project financial statements were
clean, identifying no issues. Quarterly financial reports (IFRs) were submitted to the
World Bank in a timely manner and the reports were assessed to be reliable, with a few
exceptions in the early stages of implementation when, due to accounting software
deficiencies the reports contained some inaccuracies (certain items and figures not
reconciling etc.) which were resolved once the initial problems with the software were
“fine-tuned?. In general, the accounting system was acceptable, although it needed some
adjustment in the early phases of implementation in order to be fully reliable and
accurate. Appropriate internal controls and procedures were instituted for the project and
applied in practice. The financial management function was properly staffed throughout
implementation by a qualified and experienced specialist. The Designated Account
opened in the National Bank of Macedonia was properly administered. Disbursements
under the Loan proceeded according to plan. By the closing date US$ 9,445,518.04
equivalent had been disbursed or 96.46% of the loan proceeds.

Procurement
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
62.       Goods and consulting services were procured in accordance with the
“Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits? published by the
Bank in January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, September 1997 and
January 1999 (the Guidelines) and “Guidelines: Selection and Employment of
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers? published by the Bank in January 1997 and
revised in September 1997, January 1999 and May 2002 (the Consultant Guidelines), as
provided in the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement provided that some packages be
post reviewed but, at the request of the Project Director of the PMU and in agreement
with the project team, all procurement packages were prior reviewed, including
specialized trainings, workshops, study tours, and conferences financed under the project.
63.      For all procurement, irrespective of value, the Borrower used the Bank’s
standard bidding documents for goods and Request for Proposals for consulting
services, including the Bank’s regional sample documents, standard form of
consulting contracts and standard bid evaluation report forms. This facilitated the
Bank’s review of procurement documents.



                                             15
64.       The procurement staff in the PIU received additional training in
Procurement of IT Systems organized by the World Bank in Sarajevo, Project
Management in a World Bank-funded Project, Control of Project Delivery, Procurement
and Financial Management Procedures organized by International Labor Organization
(ILO) Center in Turin; and Selection and Recruitment of Consultants in WB-financed
project organized by ILO Center in Turin.
65.       Procurement was rated Satisfactory for the most part of the life of the
project until the latter part when it was rated Moderately Satisfactory. The Bank
sent a strong message to the Client regarding the deteriorating quality of bid evaluation
reports and the clear attempts of the bid evaluation committee to manipulate the
evaluation process for a number of packages under the project. This led to the Bank's
repetitive message for submission of revised bid evaluation reports, which created delays
in awarding and signing of contracts. The situation was further aggravated by the delay
in completing the procurement activities for two packages: procurement of additional
hardware equipment for the MLSP and the SWCs, and the development of CBMIS. The
problem encountered with the procurement of CBMIS is discussed in detail in paragraph
2.2 (Implementation). Although the problems were eventually resolved, it caused delays
in overall implementation resulting in two extensions of the Loan Closing Date, i.e. to
June 30, 2010 and then to May 31, 2011.
66.     Despite the problems described above, all other packages were procured
and contracts completed. There was no misprocurement case under the project.
Procurement plan was updated as required, and procurement notices and contract awards
were published as prescribed in the Guidelines.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

67.       The SPIL has provided an investment framework for continuation of the
pension reform initiated by the Government and, as such, has paved the way for
further reforms towards ensuring sustainability of the pension system in future.
Support to the Government’s efforts to preserve the long-term sustainability of the
pension system, in the absence of a follow-up pension reform investment operation, has
continued through the DPL 1, disbursed in April 2011, and a recently negotiated Policy
Based Guarantee (PBG). Policy dialogue linked to these two interventions has
encouraged the Government to introduce a number of measures to reduce the costs of the
overall system. Through tightening the eligibility criteria for survivor pensions, reduction
of valorization coefficients, reducing fees for various agencies, slowing down the
originally planned reduction in pension insurance contributions, and other policy
measures, sustainability of the pension system improved and it provides better incentives
for labor force participation and contribution compliance. At the same time, the policy
dialogue in this field will need to be maintained to prevent policy reversals and to convey
emerging best practices, especially in the field of private pension products (2nd and 3rd
pillar).
68.      The SPIL has strategically laid the ground for continued efforts towards
further strengthening of the social safety net, supported by a new investment operation
– the Conditional Cash Transfer Project (CCTP). Approved in 2009, the CCTP continues


                                            16
to support investments for further strengthening the effectiveness and the efficiency of
the social safety net through introduction of conditional cash transfers, further
improvements in the administration, oversight, monitoring and evaluation of social
assistance transfers and their linkages to building national human capital. The key
elements of the CCTP are directly attributable to the technical assistance activities
financed by the SPIL. It is expected that the CCTP will build on and extend the
improvements in the social assistance system started by SPIL, including the broadening
of its coverage, achieving greater targeting efficiency and consequently harmonizing and
consolidating still overlapping social assistance programs/benefits. The ways to achieve
these goals were paved by the new reformed legal and regulatory framework, supported
by the Project. The greater objectives of the Social Safety Net reform were addressed by
the investments financed by the Project such as the recently established network between
the MLSP and the SWC, and the Cash Benefits MIS, whose full functioning is expected
to start under the new follow-up CCTP intervention. The real intended outcome,
however, had to await the completion of the system.



3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
69.      The relevance of objectives, design, and implementation are rated High.
70.       Overall, the objectives and design of the pension parts of the project were
timely and fully appropriate for the circumstances of FYR Macedonia, addressing
all issues relevant to the successful implementation of the pension reform. Indeed,
the project achieved more than its original objectives. The technical assistance and
policy advice provided helped to establish the next steps in developing the private
pension sector and put in place the instruments necessary for further policy decisions (e.g.
portfolio choice, continuing institutional changes in disability assessment and
rehabilitation, benefit guarantees in the presence of various payout modalities to make
sure that no annuity purchased at retirement remains un-serviced for reasons of
bankruptcy, insolvency or any other reason, etc).
71.       The inter-related objectives of fiscal sustainability and administrative
efficiency of a pension system are crucial to serve the long-term policy objectives of
old age income adequacy and equity. In small, open economies like FYR Macedonia,
fiscal prudence is particularly important since the pool of public revenues, which can be
turned to augmenting insufficient pension contributions, is limited. By the time of the
Project's design, the Government had already decided to reform its pension system by
introducing parametric adjustments to the traditional social security pension scheme and
establishing both a privately managed, defined contribution, fully funded –mandatory -
second pillar and a voluntary 3rd pillar operating along principles similar to those of the
2nd pillar. The Project's primary aim was to assist the implementation of the reforms
through policy advice and intensive technical assistance. The Project’s design, its
components, instruments and objectives chosen were fully relevant to this primary aim of
the Project.



                                            17
72.       The objectives and the design of the Social assistance part of the Project
were relevant and consistent with the development priorities of both the
Government and the World Bank. Their relevance has grown over time as confirmed
by the Program of the current Government, the National Strategy on Alleviation of
Poverty and Social Exclusion (2010-2020). The Project provided a framework for a
systemic approach to the reform of the social safety net by: (i) introducing a
comprehensive definition of income for the assessment of the eligibility for social
assistance benefits, (ii) the development of secondary regulations (“the rulebooks?),
endorsed on the basis of the new Law on Social Protection, and (iii) ensuring that the
social transfers are directed towards the most vulnerable. The Government has pursued
reforms in this area and the results are being achieved.
73.       The high relevance of the objectives, design and the implementation of the
Social Assistance component has been re-confirmed by the fact that the sectoral
reforms – policy and technical assistance advice and related investments, all
supported by the Project - paved the way for the introduction of new and innovative
social protection programs such as the Conditional Cash Transfer program and the
Energy Poverty program, both legislated by the Law on Social Protection. The CCTP
program aims to positively affect the human capital in the country and reduce the inter-
generational transmission of poverty by directly linking social assistance cash transfers
with human capital development; the Energy poverty program serves as a mitigation
measure against the impact of the energy prices on the poor. The efficient targeting and
administration of both programs, the CCTP in particular, as well as further reforms of the
social cash benefits, would be impossible or at least ineffective in the absence of the CB
MIS developed under the SPIL Project.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
74.      This evaluation rates achievement of PDO as Moderately Satisfactory based
on the Project achieving both outcome indicators and most of its intermediate indicators.
The Moderately Satisfactory rating reflects the average of Satisfactory rating for the
Pension administration part of the PDO and the Moderately Satisfactory rating for the
Social assistance part of the PDO.
75.        Pension System Administration The development objective was to improve the
efficiency of social protection through improved administration and long-term
sustainability of the pension system. This objective was achieved through (a) improved
efficiency and transparency of contribution collection, (b) faster, cheaper, more
transparent and efficient administration of PDIF operations, especially in relation to
benefit assessment, eligibility and payout controls, (c) further reforms in addition to those
already in place at the beginning of the project (2004), especially in terms of disability
pensions and special entitlements, (d) building analytical capacity enabling MLSP and
PDIF to propose, evaluate, quantitatively assess potential changes to pension policy and
systemic parameters, (e) enabling MAPAS to regulate and supervise the private pension
industry and (f) assisting NBRM in performing its temporary functions as custodian to
newly established pension schemes until the commercial banks were able to assume that
function..



                                             18
76.        More efficient administrative procedures in pension benefit assessment and
payment controls as evidenced by application processing times and disability assessment
costs. The Project sought to make the eligibility control and benefit assessment more
client-friendly by shortening processing times and reducing reliance on paper-based
records unless evidence had to be obtained from abroad. These objectives were achieved
through investing in new networking hardware and software enabling PDIF staff to
access contribution histories and other relevant data without delay and by providing
training for and monitoring of client relation transactions. As a consequence, the time
necessary to process benefit applications and verify eligibility decreased from an average
of 60 days to 15 days, with over 90 percent of applications processed within 30 days and
98 percent within the legal deadlines (which are more relaxed than the project's
objectives). Control over payment termination was also improved by regular cross-
referencing of Ministry of Justice databases (citizens' registry) and PDIF beneficiary data.
Results were achieved: the share of old age applications processed within 30 days of
receiving documentation exceeded the 90 percent target value.
77.       The Project also aimed to make the disability assessment procedures more
efficient by reducing the number of stages the applicant has to submit to and more cost-
effective by relying on experts employed or contracted solely by the PDIF. These goals
were achieved - reducing the direct costs of disability assessment by half and reducing
the time an applicant had to wait for the award of disability benefits - and, in addition to
the primary outcome of faster and cheaper disability assessment, also made it possible to
apply the revised eligibility criteria of disability. More efficient disability assessment
improves targeting of benefits and thereby also renders the public pension system fiscally
more sustainable.
78.       Contribution collection improved, exceeding the target (85%) specified in the
PAD. Improvements took place in two ways. First, the system of registering contributors
and contributions as well as verifying monthly contribution payments against forms had
to be automated. This was necessary partly to improve collection rates and make
enforcement more effective, but also to prepare PDIF for batching and transferring
information and funds to private pension funds in time and without errors. Later it was
agreed that a unified collection regime was necessary to further simplify the submission
of tax and contribution returns and to permit the Public Revenues Office (PRO) the cross
checks and unified audits needed for high participation and compliance. Unified
collection was not part of the original project design; however, the outputs of the project
were fully utilized by the PRO and in the creation of a large tax payers' bureau.
79.       The collection reform entailed the introduction of electronic submission of
contribution returns, prepared with audited software conducting automatic cross-checks
and permitting wage payment orders on condition of meeting all related tax payment
obligations. The reform also introduced new business procedures allowing PDIF to
identify risks (such as when contribution returns indicated a drop in total employer
contribution liabilities) and to act on the information obtained. As a result of these
developments, collection rates increased from 76.3% in 2004 to 92% in late 2010. This
positive outcome directly served the overall development objective - improved
sustainability of the pension system - and the outputs produced under the project were
crucial to the outcome.


                                            19
80.       In terms of privileged pensions (occupational early retirement and accelerated
service time accrual), the project assisted in changing the basic principles of the system
and introducing an updated list of jobs which entitle employees to such privileges.
Together, these outcomes -and the project's outputs supporting them- are expected to
gradually reduce public pension spending, improve system dependency ratios and give
incentives for a higher labor force participation rate.
81.      The creation of an operational NBRM custodian unit was crucial to the pension
reform. Custodian institutions - typically commercial banks - are important for protecting
pension fund members' interests. They are also important in enforcing investment and
accounting regulations, controlling investment activities, and providing information, from
a source independent of pension funds, to the regulator. At the start of the Project, there
were no financial intermediaries in FYR Macedonia requiring custody services. Thus,
there were neither regulations, nor institutions that could offer such services. As a
temporary solution, it was agreed that the National Bank would act as custodian for the
newly established pension funds. The NBRM's role as custodian also meant that all -cash
and securities- accounts of the pension funds were managed by NBRM and it was also
the central bank's role to contract and control overseas sub-custodians. This sub-
component was a success insofar as the hardware, software and training provided enabled
NBRM to fulfill its role until commercial banks were licensed to offer custody services in
2009. The objective was fully achieved and is viewed as a fixed cost of introducing
private pension schemes given the constraints presented by FYR Macedonia's capital
market development.
Social Protection Program Support
82.       The PDO under this Project’s component was to be achieved through improved
(i) targeting and (ii) administration of the cash benefits, as two aspects of a social
assistance policy and administration reform supported by the Project.
83.       It is clear from the PAD that the core content of the Project supported activities,
and the associated qualitative performance indicators in the Project’s Results Framework,
were focused on improving the benefits administration as the primary outcome of the
Social Assistance component of the Project, and were less focused on targeting.
Improvements in targeting, although monitored and measured by a quantitative outcome
indicator, increase share of Social Assistance expenditure going to the bottom two deciles
(bottom quintile) by at least 3%, have emerged as an indirect result of improvements in
the benefits administration supported by the Project rather than arising from any direct
Project activities. For evaluation and attribution purposes, the objective ‘improved
targeting’ was assessed and interpreted as an outcome of the chain of Project financed
activities and results, which include the initial technical assistance inputs leading to
reforms in the legal and regulatory framework governing the social safety net. The new
Law on Social Protection and its respective implementing regulations, supported by the
Project, endorsed a revised methodology for determining income for benefit eligibility,
which led to improved income calculation, reduction of inclusion and exclusion errors
and ultimately resulting in improved targeting. The Project continued to finance
improvements in the institutional systems, capacities and infrastructure, including
technical specifications for the business processes that improved benefits administration,
network equipment for horizontal and vertical connectivity among the MLSP and the


                                             20
SWCs; IT hardware and finally the IT software which, for reasons already discussed,
could not be completed during the lifetime of the Project.
84.       The part of the development objective relating to targeting - increase share of
social assistance expenditure going to the bottom two deciles (bottom quintile) of the
population by at least 3% - was fully achieved given that the actual increase of this
indicator is over 5%. The share going to the top quintile also decreased, so the PDO
indicator – improved targeting - has been met.
85.       The quantitative intermediate results indicator No. 6 – increased number of
social assistance beneficiaries in the lowest deciles, with the target value set at at least
5% increase of the SA beneficiaries in the bottom quintile, was not met. The reasons
leading to such a result are mixed: the Project successfully supported the gradual
improvements in the legal and regulatory framework resulting in harmonization of the
definition and consistency of cash benefits, at the same time, improvements in the income
calculation caused more restrictive eligibility requirements hence gradual reduction in the
number of households receiving the social assistance cash benefits.
86.       As mentioned previously, the qualitative indicators relating to improved
administration of the cash benefits, were not tracked. These indicators were broadly
formulated implying existence of institutional systems which had not been developed in
the earlier stages of the Project’s implementation. Nevertheless, these untracked
qualitative indicators have been partially achieved under the Project as the unified CB
MIS was nearly brought to its completion. The final operationalization of the CB MIS
and the outcomes expected from its use, however, were not completed prior to the end of
the Project and had to be transferred to the CCTP.

3.3 Efficiency
87.       As indicated in the PAD and as is often the case with social protection
projects, neither economic nor financial rates of return are directly observable. In
the absence of counterfactual information, it is not possible to determine the extent to
which improved pension revenue collection is attributable to the project vs. other
institutional, macroeconomic or regulatory factors.
88.       However, indirect evidence suggests that the efficiency impact of the
pension Administration component is Substantial and has contributed to
strengthening the sustainability of pension system financing. As an immediate result
of the reformed contribution collection system in 2006, the number of insured people
registered in the PDIF increased from 348,500 at the end of 2005 to 394,882 by the end
of 2006, a 13.3 percent increase which cannot be fully explained by the pick-up in
economic activity (GDP growth accelerated from 4.4 percent in 2005 to 5 percent in
2006). As a result, the revenues of the PDIF increased by 9 percent in 2005. Strong
results were also achieved in later years with revenues growing by 10 percent and 16.6
percent in 2007 and 2008, respectively. Furthermore, the pension system introduced
through the SPIL operation was largely used to implement the highly successful payroll
reform in 2009 which streamlined wage contracting, introduced greater transparency in
labor relations and simplified wage payments. The number of insured people further
increased as a result of this reform (despite GDP contracting in 2009 due to the global


                                            21
economic crisis and recovering very gradually in 2010). As a result, the number of
contributors at the end of 2010 stood at 466,280, or 33.8 percent above the baseline value
(2004). The efficiency gains from the payroll reform was used to start the process of
gradual reduction in the social insurance contribution rates which reduces the burden on
the real sector. It also helped to moderate the impact of the crisis on the real sector and is
expected to ensure that labor costs remain competitive going forward. However, the rate
reduction is also putting a strain on PDIF’s finances which combined with the uncertain
external economic environment would require a prudent approach to pension policies in
the future.
89.       The management and control systems introduced in the PDIF have
improved the administrative procedures in the institution resulting in improved
services to insurees as well as reduced possibilities for fraud and corruption. While
there are no precise measurements of the reduced time-costs of clients in FYR
Macedonia, the customer satisfaction survey of the Public Revenues Office (the agency
that took-over the integrated collection of contribution and personal income tax in 2009)
revealed that only 5 percent of companies in 2009 found “completing and filing tax
records? a problem, down from 10 percent in 2007 which can be at least partially
attributed to the SPIL-supported reform of collection of contributions6. According to the
State Statistics Office, 2.2 percent of employees did not receive their wages in 2011,
compared to 15.6 percent in December 2005 prior to the start of the reform. Additional
benefits from the pension system reform could be expected from the development of the
financial sector as a result of the functioning of the private pension funds. These funds
accumulated savings of around 3 percent of GDP by late 2011 which can be used as a
stable and predictable source of financing for the financial sector.
90.       The efficiency gains from the Social Assistance component are expected
over the medium-term. The SPIL helped develop instruments and policies that could set
the stage for significant efficiency gains in the social protection area. More specifically,
the Project financed the development of software solutions for the CB MIS aimed at
cutting administrative time and costs, and created the conditions for design and
implementation of policies leading to a harmonized definition of income and improved
targeting accuracy, which should reduce the cost of the social assistance system.
However, the CB MIS efficiencies will only be felt once this system is operational, which
will materialize beyond the lifetime of the Project.
91.       The operationalization of the CB MIS would allow better understanding of
the effectiveness of social assistance policies and better information to support
decision making about the future development of the social assistance system,
including the options for possible harmonization of eligibility criteria between cash
benefits programs. It would be important to ensure that savings generated as a result of
the CB MIS efficiency gains remain in the social assistance area to improve the capacity
of the social safety net to protect against poverty.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
92.       The Project’s overall outcome rating is considered Moderately Satisfactory.
It is based on the overall Project’s achievements attributable to the intervention under
both Pension Administration and the Social Assistance components. The Moderately
Satisfactory rating reflects the average of Satisfactory rating for the Pension
administration part of the PDO and the Moderately Satisfactory rating for the Social
assistance part of the PDO. Such ratings were due to the following reasons.
93.       The Project directly supported the achievements of the pension administration
reform initiated by the Government. It was highly relevant, it achieved its objectives and
this is why the ICR team rated this dimension of the PDO as Satisfactory.
94.       The Project supported the Government’s comprehensive social safety net
reform. It was relevant and achieved improvements in the targeting. Nevertheless, the
overall outcome rating for the social assistance part of the PDO is Moderately
Satisfactory, due to the delayed start of the activities related to development of the
software solutions for the CB MIS and protracted procurement process. Despite two
extensions of the Project’s closing date, completion of the CB MIS system had to be
transferred to the follow up operation, the CCTP, where the anticipated results are
expected to materialize in the near future.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
95.       While the Project was not designed explicitly as a poverty reduction
operation, its ultimate objective was to contribute to poverty reduction and
significant positive impacts can be expected over the medium-term. The Project
design focused on the administration and efficiency of the country’s pension and social
assistance systems. Given the importance of pensions for poverty alleviation for a
significant part of the population, the improvements achieved in the system are critical to
the ability of the pension system to support the vulnerable. In the absence of Project
supported reforms the budgetary transfers necessary to ensure regular payment of
pensions would have been higher hence would have caused redirection of the public
resources from other priorities.
96.       The reforms in the social assistance area that were initiated under the
operation and that will be implemented over the medium-term should also have a
considerable poverty impact as targeting of the social safety net improves. The fact
that the share of social assistance expenditure going to the bottom two deciles (bottom
quintile) of the population has been increased during the Project’s implementation while
at the same time the share going to the top quintile has decreased indicates that the
Project has improved targeting. It is expected that the improved efficiency in the system
resulting from the SPIL-supported reforms will generate savings that will be used to
strengthen the ability of social transfers to protect the vulnerable.
97.      The operation did not impact gender inequalities.




                                            23
(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

98.       The main objectives of the Project were institutional strengthening and
modernization as a means of assisting the implementation of policy reforms already
legislated or planned. These objectives have been achieved. In fact, rendering MAPAS
operational was largely achieved by the Project itself. PDIF is able to perform its core
functions faster, more reliably and more transparently than before the Project. The IT
infrastructure and operational procedures have improved and allow for real-time
interchange of data and the reliance on a unified contributor registration and tax
collection system. These are crucial preconditions for better contribution compliance and
more effective enforcement which, ultimately, contribute to the rule of law, the
emergence of a taxpayer mentality and more sustainable public finances. The Project
improved analytical capacities in three institutions: (i) PDIF, (ii) MAPAS, and (iii) MLSP
and exercised a marginal but positive impact on a fourth (NBRM). These capacities are
maintained and used by policymakers.
99.       Building actuarial analytical capacity is crucial for informing policymakers
of the likely fiscal and welfare consequences of legislative proposals as well as for
estimating the impact of the changing macroeconomic, labor market and financial
sector conditions. Knowledge transfer was achieved through the development and
training in the use of an actuarial model. MAPAS, PDIF and MLSP staff received
training (although by the end of the Project only PDIF and MAPAS were able to retain
trained staff due to wage differentials among public agencies and the increasing private
sector demand for actuarial expertise). Today, both PDIF and MAPAS regularly use the
model for actuarial projections and are capable of changing the parameters of the model
as legal amendments require.
100.      Although MAPAS was established before the 2nd pillar commenced
operations, it had to be built mostly as a green-field project. There was no technical
capacity in the country to supervise pension funds and the financial sector was not
advanced enough to function as a pool of knowledge to rely on. Through investment in
hardware, software, intensive consultation with experts, study tours and training course,
the Project created a regulator with staff well-prepared to regulate and supervise the
industry created by the reform. The Project also assisted in creating the necessary by-
laws and legal amendments, the result of which is a regulatory framework mostly in line
with international best practice.
101.      Establishment of the network between the MLSP and the social welfare
centers (SWCs) improved the communications between the key agencies and
strengthened the institutional capacity and infrastructure required for more
effective administration of the social assistance benefits and other social protection
programs. This positive institutional change can be directly attributed to the Project.
The Cash Benefit MIS is expected to contribute considerably to the enhanced capacities
of the SWCs’ staff to manage the processes of application, rights determination,
assigning cash benefits, payments, etc. Yet, the real achievement of the intended
outcome has to await the completion of the system, which could not be fully attributed to
the Project itself. As discussed earlier, the finalization of the software solutions for the



                                            24
CB MIS in an advanced stage had to be handed over to another World Bank- financed
operation, the CCTP, for its final completion and implementation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

102.    Overall, the main outcomes of the Pension component appear sustainable,
however, there are risks which the Government will need to monitor and mitigate:
      The PRO will need to ensure that all information necessary for maintaining up-to-
       date eligibility records are received by PDIF to ensure contribution compliance.
      The Government's objective of increasing competitiveness through lowering labor
       taxes needs to be considered in light of the pension system's financial
       sustainability and welfare adequacy.
      Reducing contribution rates also creates risks for pension fund members through
       higher expenses and resulting lower net returns on contributions made, and places
       the decision of those members who opted into the multipillar system, in a
       different context as the expected second pillar benefits will become smaller in
       comparison to the parameters originally introduced by the reform. Second pillar
       savings may no longer be sufficient to compensate for pension rights forgone at
       the time of joining the new system. Thus, a change that appears parametric may
       alter the pension policy dialogue and may contribute to future policy reversals.
      MAPAS and PDIF will need to ensure that they can retain their skilled staff and
       institute a training schedule, which enables the relatively quick training of new
       staff to avoid loss of analytical capacity. MLSP does not have any actuaries at the
       moment and needs to rely on PDIF in terms of analyzing policy options. This
       compromises the Ministry's own policymaking functions, especially in cases
       when such policy options are considered which do not coincide with the pension
       fund's institutional interests.
103.      The success of the structural pension reform depends, to a large extent, on
the efficiency of the newly created 2nd pillar; to operate at low costs and be able to
provide payout products without generating undue upfront loads (deductions at the
time of annuity purchase). Meeting these conditions can be promoted by regulations and
supervision but without robust, liquid, deep financial markets, competing financial
service providers the pension industry cannot fulfill its promise.
104.    The greatest risks to the success of the 2nd pillar remains the lack of
domestic securities other than public debt, the absence of other financial services
companies competing for provider and advisory services. There are no annuity


                                           25
products available yet and when they start being marketed it is likely that only a limited
number of providers will offer these contracts. Policymakers and regulators could
become captive to industries solely created to serve the instrument (private pensions) of a
social policy objective (operating a pension mandatory pension system). To offset these
risks, the Government may need to consider how pension funds, and later annuitants,
could rely more heavily on foreign investments, foreign financial service providers and
products.
105.      The main risk associated with the development outcomes of the Social
Assistance component is that the CB MIS does not become operational and effective
and so does not lead to the anticipated improvements in the effectiveness and efficiency
of the benefits administration and therefore also the targeting of the social cash benefits.
As discussed in other sections of this ICR, the CB MIS, in an advanced stage, was
transferred to another World Bank- financed operation, where it is expected to achieve its
intended development impact.



5. Assessment of World Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 World Bank Performance
World Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
106.      Performance of the World Bank teams in ensuring Quality at Entry is
rated Moderately Satisfactory for reasons presented in more detail in section 2.1. In
strategic terms and given the importance which the Government attached to this Project,
the World Bank’s support was adequately framed within the country assistance
framework. A preparation facility, the PHRD, was secured, as well as complementary
support through development policy lending. Other positive pre-effectiveness activities
included several pre-appraisal reviews which led to clear definition of the planned sets of
development outcomes, and corresponding fiduciary arrangements. These positive
aspects of the World Bank performance at this stage would normally deserve Satisfactory
rating, however some inconsistencies in the Results framework, addressed in Section 2.3,
led the ICR team to rate the World Bank performance as Moderately Satisfactory.
Quality of Supervision
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
107.      The World Bank team’s performance in terms of the quality of supervision
is rated Moderately Satisfactory. On the positive side, the World Bank team was
genuinely focused on ensuring the development impact of the activities financed under
the Project. The latter was rendered possible given that the team was stable with very few
changes in its composition and with a proper skill mix which provided hands-on
attention, timely identification of technical and implementation problems and quick
reactions in providing appropriate advice aimed at effective resolution of emerging
issues. The World Bank team developed a strong partnership with the Government
counterparts creating the grounds for dialogue and open discussion about policy,



                                            26
technical and implementation issues affecting both development outcomes and project
implementation.
108.      The adequacy of the supervision inputs and processes was satisfactory. The
team was pro-active, practicing regular supervision visits and closely following up in
between such visits with the counterparts, mobilizing promptly country and sector
management whenever their attention and support would be required. Procurement and
financial management oversight were an integral part of the supervision visits throughout
implementation.
109.      Some of the ISRs could have been more candid and realistic in capturing
the weaknesses in the implementation and capacity constraints and the likely impact
of the protracted procurement process on achievement of the objectives. The existence of
a different set of indicators in the ISRs as compared to the PAD, some of which were
introduced at a late stage of implementation, did not result in the formal revision of the
monitoring framework for the Project.
Justification of Rating for Overall World Bank Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
110.     The ICR team rates the overall World Bank performance as Moderately
Satisfactory for the reasons described above.

5.2 Borrower Performance
Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

111.       The Government performance is rated Satisfactory. This rating is based
on continued and strong Government commitment and support for the Project
which was deemed by the successive governments as a Project of high strategic
relevance. Regardless of the actual level of absorptive capacities, the governments
undertook full responsibility and demonstrated full ownership over the Project’s
activities. Apart from some delays in passing essential laws (like in the case of the Law
on Social Protection), overall whenever Government’s actions, legislative, regulative,
personnel or other type of actions/decisions, were required, the government would move
rapidly to create conditions for resolution of the practical problems in Project’s
implementation. Worth mentioning are the positive effects achieved through the regular
portfolio monitoring organized by the Government and the World Bank, addressing the
short and medium-term implementation milestones, key bottlenecks and actions to be
taken by both the Government and the World Bank in the portfolio implementation,
including the SPIL. The actions were discussed at regular Government sessions while the
conclusions of these discussions—in the form of a Government decree—were
communicated to the line ministry and the World Bank. The leadership, oversight and
advisory role of the Ministry of Finance was also conducive to the ICR team’s conclusion
to rate the Government’s performance Satisfactory.

Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory


                                           27
112.      The implementing agency’s performance is rated Moderately Satisfactory.
For most of the implementation time, the MLSP through its pension and social
protection departments demonstrated unquestionable commitment to the Project
and the overall reform agenda supported by the Project. The Pension and the Social
Protection working groups were meeting on a regular basis and their participation and
contribution to the process of managing the Project supported activities secured a
stronger buy in for the reforms. Several changes of ministers and other high level MLSP
officials did not affect the continuity, political commitment and ownership of the Project.
As discussed in other sections of this ICR, however, the capacity constraints particularly
featured by the Social Protection Department had affected the Project’s implementation.
113.      The implementation arrangements coordinated by the PMU worked well.
The PMU had a good track record from the preparation stage. The PMU staff were
thoroughly professional, committed to the Project objectives and headed by an
experienced and skilled Project Director. Since the Project’s objectives, particularly
under Component 1, entailed participation of a number of agencies in implementation,
the Project Director and the PMU helped to get these structures functioning together. In
addition, the Project Director and the PMU successfully coordinated the expert based
working groups responsible for managing the technical work, timely resolution of related
implementation issues and monitoring progress of the Project’s components.
114.      The predominant part of the PMU’s work was related to their fiduciary
responsibilities and these were performed well.             These functions, including
procurement, were pursued professionally, with knowledge and integrity. In many cases,
the bidding documents and processes were prepared during the preparation stage, thus
allowing accelerated procurement procedures. At some point in the implementation,
however, the task team observed some irregularities in the regular procurement
procedures, including some failed attempts for mis-representation of facts relevant for bid
evaluation procedures. The World Bank task team’s observations were brought to the
attention of the Government and the World Bank management followed by clear
specification of remedial actions after which this practice was eliminated. These
temporary setbacks led the ICR team to rate the Implementing agency’s performance
Moderately Satisfactory.

Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

115.   Based on the reasons described above, the ICR team rates the overall
Borrower’s performance as Moderately Satisfactory.

6. Lessons Learned
116.      The time required for successful completion of projects of this scope and
level of complexity needs to be more conservatively assessed. The high demand on the
limited human capacities and staff resources was a challenge, which from time to time
impinged upon effective implementation. In the pension area, an experienced, but small


                                            28
team was responsible for managing a large number of very complex tasks and
assignments simultaneously and under great time pressure. In the social assistance area, a
less experienced team was expected to manage: (i) a large internationally hired technical
assistance contract, and (ii) the team of the contracted consulting company, where there
were some delays and confusion around the directions and the content of the proposed
reform measures. ECA’s experience with the procurement of large, complex IT projects
suggest that they are often contentious and are rarely concluded quickly.
117.       The priority given to the pension administration part of the Project led to
delays in the social assistance part of the Project. Such delays in the Social Assistance
component were due to the predominant focus of the Government on the launching of the
second pension pillar and the massive preparatory activities leading to this task. As
discussed in various sections of this ICR, the Government and the MLSP, as line ministry
in charge of the pension policy and pension system administration, followed a well
defined reform activity schedule with strictly determined milestones and adhered fully to
this high priority agenda. Although the activities constituting the two dimensions of the
PDO were managed separately, the predominant focus on the pension part of the Project
did absorb the Ministry’s human resources available for managing the high priority,
policy-oriented, and externally-financed pension reform activities. In addition, at the time
of the Project design and appraisal, awareness of the need for initiating the major social
safety net reform was still in a developing stage. When implementation of the Social
Assistance component started, other delays were encountered around the selection of
appropriate policy choices which had to be legislated and regulated to provide the
grounds and inputs for designing the new system for benefit administration. As discussed
earlier, the selection process of the contractor to develop the software had to be repeated
three times due to: (i) lack of capacity of the selected company to complete the
assignment; and (ii) misrepresentation of facts related to the bidding process.
118.      A partial reform of tax collection - in this case, pension contribution
collection - is not necessarily a hindrance to a major tax policy and tax
administration reform. Indeed, the modernized contribution collection system, the
design and implementation of which were supported by the Project, made it easier to
establish an integrated tax collection agency. This was possible not only by the quality of
the collection processes, reporting and control processes, but also because these systems
were designed taking into account the requirements of other labor tax and contribution
collection systems and could, as a consequence, be integrated with relative ease into the
Tax Authority's information systems.
119.      In the course of tax administration reforms that integrate all collection
activities under the tax authority, care must be taken to ensure that no information
is lost. Information which is of little importance to the tax authority, but is crucial for
verifying pension eligibility and assessing benefit levels, should be collected, organized
and forwarded accurately and in a timely manner to the Pension Fund.

7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners
120.     The MLSP provided comments on the draft ICR, received on January 25,
2012. They are attached to this ICR in the Annex 7. Most of the comments are taken
into account in the finalization of this ICR. One comment which was not taken into


                                            29
account relates to the statement that the data necessary for monitoring the PDO indicator
no.2, “increased share of Social Assistance expenditure going to the bottom two deciles
(bottom quintile) by at least 3%?, was provided from the beginning of the Project. This is
true, but this data was explicitly reflected for the first time in the sixth ISR (internal WB
document). Therefore, the related paragraph in this ICR does not contradict the MLSP’s
statement. Another comment which was not taken into account is about the claim that the
MLSP SPIL team has never been informed about inclusion of the Intermediate Results
Indicator no.7, the reduction of social worker time spent on social benefits
administration, into the Project’s Results Framework. As noted in paragraph 60, this
indicator was introduced into the Project’s (and the ISR’s) Results Framework at the time
of the Mid-Term Review and subsequently reflected in the Aide Memoire, from
February, 2007.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis


1.      Implementation of the SPIL began in 2004, at a time when growth in FYR
Macedonia began to intensify reflecting the macroeconomic consolidation following the
turbulences during 2001-2002 and the buoyant global demand. GDP growth averaged
4.5 percent during 2004-2005 and accelerated further to around 5.5 percent during 2006-
2008. Still, relatively prudent macroeconomic policies kept macroeconomic imbalances
moderate compared to other countries in the region. As a result, the impact of the 2008-
2009 crisis on FYR Macedonia was relatively mild. The sharp contraction in exports and
capital inflows was off-set by a generally adequate policy response and a resilient
banking sector, resulting in a GDP contraction of only 0.9 percent in 2009. The 2010
recovery was slow (growth of 1.8 percent) as investor and consumer confidence
recovered very gradually. Economic activity picked-up more strongly in the first half of
2011 with growth reaching 5.2 percent. However, growth is expected to moderate in
response to the most recent global economic turmoil. Macroeconomic policies remained
prudent with FYR Macedonia running a modest fiscal deficit level of -2.5 percent of GDP
in 2010. The ability of the authorities to manage pension system finances and social
protection spending has played an important role in their ability to keep fiscal risks
moderate even during the crisis.

2.      Living conditions did not respond to the improved performance of the economy
prior to the 2008-2009 global economic crisis and have probably deteriorated since. Even
though there was a considerable drop in the unemployment rate (down from 37.4 percent
in 2004 to 32.3 percent in 2010) it appears that the jobs created were neither skilled nor
well paid. As a result, poverty affected around a quarter of the population in 2009 and
inequality increased.

3.      The SPIL project supported improvements in the administration and sustainability
of the country’s pension system. The reforms in the pension system were triggered by
ineffective revenue collection, record-keeping and administration in the system prior to
the reform as well as the growing risks to the long-term sustainability of the pension
system. At the same time, the system encouraged informality and resulted in high labor
costs and distorted labor market outcomes.

4.     The objective of the Pensions Administration component was: (i) to strengthen the
governance and management of the PDIF (including the reform of the pension
contribution collection system); ii) to set-up and build capacity in the Pension
Supervision Agency; iii) to build capacity in key institutions for pension system analysis
and policy development, and iv) to develop the pension system custodian function.

5.      As is often the case with social protection projects, economic and financial rates
of return are not directly observable. In the absence of counterfactual information, it is




                                           36
not possible to exactly determine the extent to which improved revenue collection is
attributable to the project vs. other institutional, macroeconomic or regulatory factors.

6.      However, indirect evidence suggests that the economic and financial impact of the
Pension Administration component is significant and has contributed to strengthening the
sustainability of pension system financing. As noted in the Economic and Financial
Analysis presented in the ICR,, the fiscal gains linked to the reformed contribution
collection system were most substantial. As an immediate result of the reformed
contribution collection system in 2006, the number of insurees registered in the PDIF
increased from 348,500 at the end of 2005 to 394,882 by the end of 2006, a 13.3 percent
increase (which cannot be fully explained by the pick-up in economic activity as GDP
growth accelerated from 4.4 percent in 2005 to 5 percent in 2006). As a result, the
revenues of the PDIF increased by 9 percent in 2005. Strong results were also achieved in
later years with revenues growing by 10 percent and 16.6 percent in 2007 and 2008,
respectively. Furthermore, the pension system introduced through the SPIL operation was
largely used to implement the highly successful payroll reform in 2009 which streamlined
wage contracting, introduced greater transparency in labor relations and simplified wage
payments. The number of insurees further increased as a result of this reform (this despite
GDP contracting in 2009 due to the global economic crisis and recovering very gradually
in 2010). As a result, the number of contributors at the end of 2010 stood at 466,280, or
33.8 percent above the baseline value (2004). The efficiency gains from the payroll
reform was this time used to start the process of gradual reduction in the social insurance
contribution rates which moderated the impact of the crisis and is expected to ensure that
labor costs remain competitive going forward. However, the rate reduction is also putting
a strain on PDIF’s finances which combined with the uncertain external economic
environment would require a prudent to pension policies in the future.

7.      On a more micro level, the systems introduced in the PDIF have improved the
administrative procedures in the institution resulting in improved services to insurees as
well as reduced possibilities for fraud and corruption. Administration and operating costs
of the PDIF in 2010 were 5 percent lower in real terms compared to 2004 largely due to
more efficient payment procedures. In addition, the newly established systems identified
number of cases of fraud and corruption.

8.       While there are no precise measurements of the reduced time-costs of clients in
FYR Macedonia, the customer satisfaction survey of the Public Revenues Office (the
agency that took-over the integrated collection of contribution and personal income tax in
2009) found that 5 percent of companies in 2009 found “completing and filing tax
records? a problem, down from 10 percent in 2007 which can be at least partially
attributed to the SPIL-supported reform of collection of contributions. At the same time,
the percent of unpaid wages declined. At the same time, and as noted in earlier sections,
the duration of PDIF procedures has been shortened thus reducing costs and improving
access for insurees. Finally, there was a considerable improvement in payment discipline.
According to the State Statistics Office reports, 2.2 percent of employees did not receive
their wages in July 2011, compared to 15.6 percent in December 2005 prior to the start of
the reform. Additional benefits from the pension system reform could be expected from



                                            37
the development of the financial sector as a result of the functioning of the private
pension funds. These funds accumulated savings of around 3 percent of GDP by late
2011 which can be used as a stable and predictable source of financing for the financial
sector. Finally, the importance of a functional pension sector actuarial unit cannot be
underestimated. The unit has been able to regularly update the actuarial model and has
been actively used over the last five years in designing the policy reforms.

9.      The SPIL project also supported reforms in the social protection area, focusing on
the information management systems and IT capacity strengthening as well as developing
a policy framework for streamlined, cost effective and better targeted cash benefits.

10.     The economic and financial gains from this component are expected over the
medium-term. The SPIL helped develop instruments and policies that could set the stage
for significant improvements in the social protection area. The existence of significant
leakage in social transfers identified through the Household Budget Survey suggests that
the economic and financial gains from improved targeting could be substantial.
According to the 2009 Poverty Assessment, around 50 percent of total social protection
spending benefited the non-poor. While improved targeting cannot eliminate all leakage
(categorical transfers will remain in the future), significant gains are possible.

11.     However, reaping these gains would only be possible if the reform efforts are
continued. The early signs are encouraging with the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy
being well advanced with activities to develop a comprehensive strategy for the social
safety net reflecting the results of the functioning of the CBMIS. This could involve
consolidation of benefits, harmonization of eligibility criteria etc. It would be important
to ensure that savings generated remain in the social assistance area to improve the
capacity of the social safety net to protect against poverty.

    Component 1 “Pension System Administration?,
Sub-component 2- Pension Supervision Agency (MAPAS) Development

Results achieved:

Project objective No. 1- Development of the regulatory framework needed for proper functioning
of the funded pension system
         According to the Law on Mandatory/Voluntary Fully Funded Pension Insurance MAPAS
passes secondary regulations relevant to the second and third pillar of the pension system.
MAPAS regularly prepares and adopts secondary regulations that are now mostly directed
towards enhancement and improvement of the system. Most of the new proposals or amendments
to the original secondary regulations have been derived from the practical implementation of the
second and third pillar.
         After five years from the implementation of the fully funded pension insurance, MAPAS
is following closely all the movements, needs, alerts of the second and third pillar and changes
the legislation accordingly, always putting as a top priority the best interests of the pension funds
members.
Under the SPIL project in 2006 a local consultant was hired as a Local Technical Assistance to
support for legislative and regulatory framework for MAPAS. The Consultant reviewed the
existing structure, status, responsibilities and reporting responsibilities of MAPAS and made
analyses and recommendations for possible changes that would strengthen the ability of MAPAS
to perform its supervisory and regulatory functions in line with the best practices in order to
achieve maximum protection of pension funds members. SPIL supported the establishment of the
on-site supervision in MAPAS by financing an international expert in the 2006 and 2007. The
expert wrote the first Manual on On-site Audit of Pension Companies, Pension Funds and the
Custodian as guidelines for the procedures that the supervisor should follow when performing the
on-site control.
In 2007, with the contribution from the Dutch Grant, MAPAS worked with an international
Pension Implementation expert, who wrote a White Paper on the Third Pillar design. The White
Paper was further developed by domestic institutions and transformed into regulation. The expert
also assisted MAPAS in its development, and particularly with the proposal of overall MAPAS
strategy, budget, financing, staffing and human resource policy. The expert established the basis
for reports and bulletin preparation, as one of the crucial follow-ups of the fully funded
components. The expert prepared an extensive report with projections on paid and accrued
contributions for the next 10 years in the second pillar.
        In 2008, MAPAS worked with one of the most renowned international consultants on the
analyses of the capital and financial markets in the Republic of Macedonia. This consultant was
also supported by a local expertise. The in-depth analyses of the consultant consisted of proposals
for changes in the legislation regarding the investments of the pension funds.
        Then in 2011, a consultant was hired to assist the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy and
MAPAS with the preparation of key Secondary Regulation needed for the Law on Payment of
Fully Funded System Pension Benefits. As the fully funded components of the system are
maturing, the institutions have to be prepared for the payout phase. Therefore, SPIL covered the
entire development of this phase, from the design, through the Law (under MLSP as a SPIL
beneficiary) and the secondary regulations. Also, another consultant was hired to Review on
Regulation for the chart of accounts, the form and the content of basic and additional financial
statements of pension funds, with recommendations for changes in accordance with IAS and
IFRS.




                                                 48
The overall impression is that in the entire period of implementation of SPIL its support was
crucial for the development of the vital pieces of legislation that supported the establishment of
the system as well as its improvement and enhancement.

Project objective No. 2- design and implementation of the MAPAS business processes and
MAPAS capacity building

        Business processes and IT

         SPIL project has significantly contributed in building of IT capacity of MAPAS. The
equipping of MAPAS with the initial hardware and software from the SPIL project started in
2005 and then, over the years, it further enhanced with up-to-dated hardware and additional
software for the third pillar.
         With the first IT procurement, MAPAS equipped the data base center with servers and
other hardware necessary for hosting the IT system for controlling the second pillar. This is
equipment that enables the center to function according to relevant domestic and international
standards and rules for data base centers, including fire protection, burglary, deionization,
constant electricity supply and maintenance of constant temperature and humidity. The package
included also procurement of SW licenses for protection of the system.
         After finalizing the business process the process of creating and developing of software
solutions/modules began. By means of international tender realized through SPIL project a
company was selected to develop the most important part of the MAPAS IT System- the off-site
supervision software.
         The development of the SW was crucial for the successful implementation of the second
pillar and for successful operation of MAPAS on daily basis, enabling a day-to-day supervision of
the Pension Companies. Additional procurement of software took place in 2009, in order to
complement the existing software with modules for third pillar supervision. This software was
built upon the platform of the existing software in order to provide compatibility and in order for
both components to function as one.
         SPIL organized international tenders for procurement of hardware equipments for
MAPAS that will enable the hosting of application, operational and data part of IT system.
Besides servers this equipment includes archiving and protection of data, licenses for the
operational system and for the data base management system, as well as PCs for MAPAS
employees. The HW is projected and dimensioned to enable continuous and quality functioning
of the IT system and a continuous flow of the business processes. SPIL supported continuous
hardware updating of servers as well as user equipment in order to provide MAPAS with the
utmost technology for performing its complex and sophisticated supervisory role.
         Another IT procurement also realized through SPIL was the Digital leased line with
Internet connection. This procurement enabled adequate access of the institutions involved in the
second pillar to the MAPAS system through a public Internet connection with a precisely
dimensioned capacity that enables continuous functioning of MAPAS business processes and
control of the Pension Companies.

Capacity building

         Today, MAPAS is an institution composed of young professionals working on very
sophisticated and new matter, with already acquired expertise through specialized trainings and
courses. Large part of the staff training was realized through SPIL by participation on local and
international seminars and courses specialized in pension reform, pension supervision and
financial markets.



                                                49
         One of the most useful components was the Capacity Building of MAPAS, performed by
the consulting house from Chile – PrimAmerica. This was a tailor made training in supervision of
Pension Companies and pension funds performed by several consultants, all experts in the
relevant area, with extensive practical knowledge in supervision. Such types of trainings give
MAPAS a significant transfer of knowledge deriving from practical experience crucial for
understanding the specifics of supervision.
         Recently, MAPAS had an international consultant that trained Control sector staff on
practical aspects of pension fund accounting with accent on application of the IAS 39, 32, 21 and
IFRS 7. This was a very specialized training, which gave the MAPAS employees a real practical
insight and expertise in how to further strengthen the supervision of pension funds.
One of the most important contributions of SPIL in terms of capacity building was that from the
local IT experts hired through SPIL one of them, after the expiration of his SPIL engagement,
remained as a regular employee of MAPAS.
Actually, the implementation period of SPIL was in the years when MAPAS was financially still
weak, so, the largest and most important portion of the staff training was realized through SPIL.
In this regard, MAPAS employees could always participate on the most important seminars,
conferences and technical meetings in the pension area, happening all over the world.
         Throughout the entire implementation period of SPIL, a total of 21 employees had been
trained in: pension supervision, capital markets, IT, PR, financial analysis etc.

Project objective No. 3 - enhancement of public understanding of the funded pension system.

Starting from the second half of 2005 MAPAS intensified the activities on informing and
educating the public on the pension system reform.

Part of the activities was covered from SPIL and included: Outsourced call center with a toll free
number where citizens called to be informed on the second pillar membership process. The
Contractor provided MAPAS with very useful information on the types of questions from the
callers which was a significant input for MAPAS on structuring its consequent activities on
informing the public and working for better protection of the interests of the pension funds’
members.

In the period from the end of 2007 until mid 2009, MAPAS took active participation in the Public
Educational Campaign of the Ministry of Labor and Social Policy.

    Component 1 “Pension System Administration?,
Sub-component 3- MLSP Capacity Building for Pension System Analysis, Policy
Development and Public Education

The Social Protection Implementation Loan played a crucial role in the MLSP capacity building
in respect to the preparation of the pension legislation and development of pension system

Achievements

 Project objective No. 1- Identification of policy options and preparation of draft pension
legislation
1.1 Design of the voluntary pension system

In 2006 the mandatory fully funded pension system become operational, and the SPIL project
enabled introducing of the voluntary fully funded pension insurance (third pillar), through
financing of international consultant that defined the legal and the regulatory aspects of the third


                                                50
pillar. The consultant prepared draft third pillar pension law that was afterwards adopted by the
government steering committee. This law is in line with the EU directives and with the other
normative aspects related to voluntary pension system. The consultant also prepared list of
needed secondary regulation and outlined its content.
In order to asses the impact of the voluntary system on the macro economy and the State budget,
another consultant was hired that made the assessment of the economic impact.
The Law was adopted by the Parliament in January 2008 and the voluntary pension system
become fully operational in 2009.

1.2 Design of Law on pension payment modalities for the fully funded pension system
In order the fully funded pension system to be legislatively covered in all its aspects, though the
SPIL project an international consultant was hired that prepared detailed design of pension
benefits payout options and benefit providers in the mandatory and voluntary fully funded system.
The consultant has also prepared draft Law on pension payment modalities and list of secondary
regulation. The Draft Law was presented to the pension companies, insurance companies, Agency
for supervision of insurance and it is expected to be adopted by the Government by the end of
2011.

1.3 Creating a multiple fund scheme in the second and third pillar of the Pension System

The creating of the multiple fund scheme in the second and third pillar of the Pension System will
increase the expected value of the pensions that members will receive. A recent tendency in the
mandatory individually funded systems is the introduction of plans that offer investment options
to their members. The general objective of this project is to enable members to choose the optimal
investment portfolio compatible with their risk and return preferences in line of lifecycle pension
saving. At the same time the Law enables, MAPAS and Ministry of Labor and Social Policy to
prescribe that Pension Company may manage more than one Pension Fund.
Through the SPIL project an consultant was engaged that analyzed and described the different types
and number of pension funds for mandatory and voluntary fully funded pension insurance (multi-
funds) and different types of portfolio composition in each type of fund; analyzed the influence of
multi-funds on the individual persons in line with lifecycle pension saving and defined the
number and types of pension funds (mandatory and voluntary) in which individual person can be
a member of; described the minimum profitability regulations and the safety mechanisms
according to fund type; and gave inputs and key points for changes of the Law on mandatory fully
funded pension insurance and Law on voluntary fully funded pension insurance regarding
introduction of multi-funds. Also the consultant prepared a list of needed secondary regulations
and an outline their contents.

Project objective No. 2- Capacity building for pension system analysis and the development of
future policy options

The SPIL project helped with the strengthening of the MLSP’s Unit for analysis, planning, and
evaluation capacity. This unit has specific purpose of supporting the Ministry in taking important
decisions by preparing technical analyses and statistics. For the needs of the pension system
analysis an local consultant was engaged. The consultant made analysis of data regarding the
pension insurance programs of the Ministry and its comprising bodies, prepared projections on
functioning and implementation of the programs in this area in cooperation with the actuarial unit
established within the PDF; prepared budgeting the pension programs, monitored indicators
defined under the SPIL and other data analysis as needed for the Ministry of labor and social
policy.



                                                51
The SPIL project provided financing of training courses that strengthen the capacity of the
MLSP’s employees in pension and disability insurance area. Also the companies that
implemented public campaigns for the pension reform provided training for the employees from
the MLSP, MAPAS, and PDI Fund that strengthen their capacities on public relations.

Project objective No. 3- Preparation and implementation of the integrated pension reform public
education campaign, including organization of training, workshops and seminars, printing and
distribution of the education materials, and other activities as needed

The SPIL project supported the whole pension reform through financing two public campaigns
that educated the public of the new reformed three pillar system.

In 2006 the first public campaign was implemented in order to educate specific targeted groups
about the new reformed two pillar pension system. The implementation of the second pillar of the
reformed pension system had significant impact on a large part of the Macedonian population. A
systematic public education and communication campaign was integral part of the reform itself
and key to its successful implementation. The main goal that was achieved by this campaign was
explaining the Macedonian citizens how the two-pillar system works; develop public awareness
and understanding of the purposes and operating principles of private pension companies and
their pension funds; understanding of the benefits of private pension fund membership;
understanding of the rights of pension fund members, and informing the citizens of the type of
factors which they should take into account when choosing between pension funds.
In 2008-2009 a public campaign was implemented in order to educate the public about the
reformed three-pillar pension system.
In April 2011 the MLSP and the World Bank organized one day International Conference on
Pension Reforms and Future Challenges. The Conference marked the completion of one of the
most successful World Bank projects in the Republic of Macedonia – SPIL (Social Protection
Implementation Loan), which played a crucial role for the pension reform in the Republic of
Macedonia. At the same time the Conference celebrated the fifth anniversary of the
implementation of the fully funded pension insurance in the Republic of Macedonia.
The number of participants on the Conference reached 120, where the majority was from
Macedonia but also there were representatives from other countries in the region (Serbia, Kosovo,
Montenegro, Albania, Croatia and Turkey). The Conference had positive media coverage as well.
This Conference was an important event for Macedonia not just because it marked the fifth
anniversary of the implementation of the fully funded pension insurance but also because it
gathered the expertise of the pension field. A lot of important discussions were developed on the
future of the multi-pillar pension systems, what are the potential risks that these types of systems
are facing and what are the experiences of countries that are more advanced in the reforms.

    Component 1 “Pension System Administration?,
Sub-component 4- Pension system custody capacity development at the NBRM

   The SPIL project supported the development of the Custody Department within the National
Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) for the custody over the second pillar pension assets.

National bank of the Republic of Macedonia was assigned a task to be custodian of the mandatory
private pension funds with changes in the Law on NBRM and the Law on Mandatory Fully
Funded Pension Insurance in June 2004. This function was new not only for the NBRM, but in
Macedonia in general, because at that moment there were no custodians to pensions nor
investment funds. Therefore, implementation of this function was a challenging task in order to
establish new regulation and new systems in the country, as well as to train people to perform this


                                                52
function. The basis that was established with implementation of this function in NBRM was later
used in the establishment of custodian units in commercial banks.

Achievements

Project objective No. 1- Custodian unit established within NBRM

In order to perform custodian function, NBRM decided to open a new unit in the Payment
Systems Department. This department had most knowledge in the field, because it already:
    - Maintained accounts for banks and process denar payment orders,
    - Maintained OTC settlement system for treasury bills and bonds,
    - Had connection with the Central Securities depository, and
    - Performed settlement of the transactions with foreign reserves of the NBRM, and the
        custodian where it will perform all custodian functions to private pension funds.

With this solution, employees already had experience in custodian services (for NBRM as a
custodian's client) and NBRM could combine employees for more flexible and efficient
operations of the custodian unit.

Project objective No. 2- Custody Information System implemented

The activities in the field of the technical assistance to the NBRM included identification of
custodian business processes, preparation of rules and regulations related to custody of the private
pension funds, record keeping and other custody-related activities. Within the SPIL project, the
following activities were finished successfully in order for the new Custody Information System
to function: technical assistance for development of technical specification for Custody
Information System and its subsequent testing, procurement of Custody Information System and
training of the custody staff for the usage of the system.

In order to give legal power to the new CIS system, the following activities were finalized by
NBRM:
     - Draft Contract with the companies which will manage pension funds and
     - Custodian operational rules.
Also, NBRM made a simulation of future operations, which was discussed with the selected
pension fund companies and MAPAS. It was latter proven that this analyses helped in the smooth
start of the operations in January 2006, without any delays or unsettled orders.

Project objective No. 3- NBRM Custody Department staff trained in custody issues

People who perform operations related to the custodian were educated through above mentioned
courses supported by SPIL project. Also, people shared the knowledge between themselves after
the training. Besides the SPIL funded training, people were trained internally for all custodian
functions. All this helped in building the personal capacity of the NBRM staff related to custodian.

     Component 2 “Social Protection Program Support Component ?,
Sub-component 1- “Policy framework for streamlined, cost effective and better targeted
cash benefits, implementation of local social planning and deinstitutionalization of social
work services, and establishment of inspection, supervision and quality assurance functions?




                                                53
Although the process of achieving the goals of the Social protection component has started with
little delay that was caused with the design of the component the predetermined goals are fully
achieved.

Achievements

 Project objective No. 1- Development of policy framework for streamlined, cost effective and
better targeted cash benefits

Achievement of the goals within the first sub-component was supported through hiring of several
international and local consultants. As a result of the daily cooperation and commitment of the
consultants and employees in MLSP’s relevant sectors, Institute for Social Affairs, Social Work
Centers, Project Management Unit as well as the working sub groups, that were established in
order more effective cooperation with consultants, in 2007 the Amendments of the Social
Protection Law and in 2009 the new Law for Social protection were adopted. Also during last
five years several amendments of the Child Protection Law were adopted

Adoption of the new Socal protection law represented a legal framework for achievement of the
specified project goals and improvement of the entire system of social protection.
Within the new Law significant changes on the cash benefits system have been introduced.
Those changes contribute in the decreasing of the administration cost and better targeting of the
cash benefits: 1) simplification of the calculation of the cash benefits; 2) introduction of the
common means test that will simplify administration procedure and contributed in decreasing of
the administration cost;3) frequency of home visits on the socal protection beneficiary have been
reduced which resulted in administrative cost’s savings;4) establishment of the legal framework
for implementation of different programs from social protection area ( conditional cash transfers,
energetic poverty etc.; 5) the amount of the benefits that were previously based on the average
monthly salary paid per employee in the R. Macedonia in the previous year and were given as a
percentage of the average salary , in the new law are set as nominal amounts which will be
adjusted on yearly basis with the increase of the living expenditures for the previous year
published by the State Statistical Office in January for the current year; 6) in order to improve
targeting i.e. the SP rights are focused to the most vulnerable groups, the incomes and the SP
and CP rights that are considered as a income for each SP right are revised; 7)for some rights that
are intended for the individuals with impairments or handicap, the means test was totally
omitted , with this changes at the same time the administrative cost which are evidently
decreased and the number of the beneficiary is inconsiderably increased; 8) MLSP has adopted
new rule books for each SP rights; 9) Based on the World Bank suggestion the amount for
Parental allowance – the right within Child Protection Law , is considered as family/household
income when that family/household applies for other SP/CP rights.

The consultants and the MLSP representatives tried to make an analysis of the cash benefits and
their combination, but due to lack of relevant data base it was concluded that this analysis should
be performed after establishment of the new software decision.

Decreasing of the administrative costs and the better targeting of the cash benefits were the main
goals that should be achieved with the adoption of the Amendments of the Child Protection Law.
Amendments of the Child Protection Law were adopted in 2004, 2005, 2008 and 2009. In the
year 2010, a fair copy was made on the Law on Child Protection.

With these Amendments significant changes in the Child Protection Law have been introduced .
The changes are as follows: 1) administration of the CP benefits, that was previously carried out


                                                54
by the Local child protection units, have been transferred to the SWCs and that contributed to
administrative cost savings and at the same time the cooperation between the specialized
departments that administrated social protection and child protection cash benefits have been
strengthened and the entire social protection system became more accessible for the users of
different benefits as all cash benefits are administrated in one facility; 2) In accordance with the
law, the right to child allowance is available for all children that live in family which incomes are
under the threshold set by the Law ( due to the budget constraints, this provision of the law will
be implemented after the accession of the R. Macedonia to the European Union) within this
provision the right to child allowance becomes available for all children irrespective of the
employment status of the parents; 3) the right- One of assistance for the new born baby, the
means test was totally omitted , with this change at the same time the administrative costs are
evidently decreased and the number of the beneficiary is unchanged; 4) The amount of the
benefits that were previously based on the average monthly salary paid per employee in the R.
Macedonia in the first half of previous year and was given as a percentage of the average salary ,
now is set as nominal amount which will be adjusted on yearly basis with the increase of the
living expenditures for the previous year published by the State Statistical Office in January for
the current year; 5) the incomes and the CP and SP rights that are considered as an income for
each CP right are revised, in order to improve targeting i.e. streamline the CP rights to the most
vulnerable groups, etc.

The new laws on one hand simplify the system and on the other hand they strengthen the law
framework which inevitably leads to a decrease of the administrative costs and improvement of
the targeting. The simplification of the laws additionally will enable development of appropriate
software solution and streamline the CP rights to the most vulnerable groups to which these
benefits are most necessary as well as reduction of the time spent on benefits administration and
will decrease the overburdeness of social workers and will allow greater dedication to the
prevention.

 Project objective No. 2- Design of plans for local self-planning and de-institutionalization for
social work services

Decentralization and deinstitutionalization of the socal services that are implemented within
MLSP also was supported by the SPIL project through hiring of international consultants.

The Law framework for implementation of the entire process decentralization in Republic of
Macedonia is given in the Law on Local Self Government (2002) and the Law on financing of the
units of local self-government (2004). In line with these laws the Social Protection Law and Child
protection Law provide legal framework for decentralization and deinstitutionalization in the
social area.
The process of decentralization thought which the responsibilities and the functions from the
Ministry should be transferred to the municipalities has begun in 2004. The first steps in the
movement toward initiating decentralization have been undertaken with the transfer of
management responsibility for homes for the elderly and kindergartens to municipalities. The
process has continued with the introduction of the new non institutional forms- “day care centers
“, commissioning of NGOs to provide care services under contracts and possibilities for the
communities to provide social services and social care and to prepare and submit the plans to
MLSP.

Ministry of Labor and social policy has prepared Program for development of Social Protection
2011-2021 (Strategy) that is adopted in 2010 and many domestic and international organizations
have positive opinion. Having in mind that the decentralization is long-term process most of the


                                                 55
recommendations are already incorporated in the Strategy. The ultimate goal is decentralization
of the existing services and development of the new forms of institutional and non institutional
services in accordance with local needs and priorities. Some of the recommendations have been
incorporated in the Law on Social Protection 2009. The registration, licensing and discipline of
social services professionals are incorporated in the Law. The MLSP has formed Committee for
licensing within ISA that will be responsible for licensing and discipline of social services
professionals. The Social Protection Law set the framework for the associations of citizens,
NGOs to have the possibility to provide socal services; some of them have partial financial
support by MLSP. In order to assure the quality of the services that are provided by the
associations of citizens and NGOs, the MLSP has set the minimum criteria that should be met by
the service providers in order to be registered in the Register within MLSP. The quality standards
for many social areas have been adopted and some of them are in the draft version. Adopted
quality standards are published on the MLSP’s web side so they become available to the users of
the social services as well as to the social services providers; capacity building of the qualified
staff continues through training, workshops as well as wider pluralization of the possible service
providers (religious organization and religious groups) are anticipated within the Law.

         In parallel with the process of decentralization the MLSP has been implementing the
process of deinstitutionalization. The consultant has a positive opinion in respect to the
deinstitutionalization process in Macedonia and has emphasized                that the effective
deinstitutionalization is a long – term process, burdened with challenges and difficulties, both
practical and ethical. The process of decentralization can be accomplished successfully within the
context of a broader social services strategy, and the processes of deinstitutionalization and
decentralization should be two linked elements.

In accordance with the recommendation the deinstitutionalization process is implementing with
precautions and must be long term sustainable. Also MLSP within the deinstitutionalization’s
plans and their implementation should put emphasis on the positive rights of adults and children
that need care, to receive that care as possible within the community.

The process of deinstitutionalization in the Republic of Macedonia has begun in the middle of the
90-ties, but since 2000 it has been intensified. The starting point was the opening of the day care
centers. Up till now there are 32 daily care centers for daily and temporary care of the children,
elder, persons with impairment and other categories.
In accordance with the National strategy for deinstitutionalization ( 2008-2018) the process of
deinstitutionalization has continued with the new forms of non institutional protection –
organized living with support for an individuals over 18-teen years of age with mental
impairments . Up till now the MLSP has opened 15 living units with 66 users/beneficiaries that
have previously been situated in the Special Institute? Demir Kapija?. This form of protection
provides high quality of the social care services, at local level in their place of living that will
facilitate beneficiary integration and their acceptance by the community.

Project objective No. 3 - Improvement of the financial management framework for payment of
cash benefits and Project objective No. 4 Establishment of new business processes for
administration and payment of different kinds of social benefits;

         Improvement of the financial management for payment of the cash benefits and creation
of new business processes for payment of different social allowances by contracting one
international and one local expert was supported by the SPIL Project. Although the contract with
the international consultant was terminated we can say that there has been significant
improvement in the budgeting and payment system for the cash benefits that is additionally


                                                56
improved with the new software solution that enables complete automatization and consolidation
of the financial management system (the budgeting and monitoring process as well as budget
execution, payment process, accounting and payment of the cash benefits) between the MLSP and
the SWCs. This type of system in place will enable timely detection of problems and timely
undertaking of corrective measures. This type of solution will promote the budgeting since it will
be based on correct data and analysis, will promote the payment process, will shorten the
necessary time, minimize the possible mistakes and decrease the overburdeness of the employees.
MLSP is also in the process of changing the payment method that is currently done through the
Post Bank and Macedonian Post and has the intention of using transaction accounts for the
payment of the major part of the cash benefits (not including those benefits intended for the
people that are no able to withdraw these financial means from their transaction accounts).

Project objective No. 5 -Inspection, supervision, monitoring and quality assurance of cash
benefits as well as social services

The introduction of social inspection, supervision and insurance of the quality of the financial
benefits as well as the social services was supposed to be supported by the SPIL project by
engagement of an international consultant. Despite the multiple intents for contracting such
consultant, the interested consultants did not possess the required experience resulting in the
MLSP having to withdraw this activity. Regardless this not being done through the SPIL project,
in January 2007 the MLSP, that is, the Social Protection Department within the MLSP has
established the Unit for Social Inspection with few employees. The Unit for Social Inspection has
mandated functions: to supervise the work of the SWCs and other social institutions in order to
ensure implementation and enforcement of the relevant laws. The Unit for Social Inspection has
outgrown in Department for Social Inspection.

From the abovementioned we can conclude that the functioning of this department has a direct
influence on achievement of the goals of this subcomponent, meaning improvement of the
targeting through minimization of the possible abuse in two directions: inclusion of
households/families/individuals in need of social protection and exclusion of
households/families/individuals that have become beneficiaries through some fraud or that have
failed to comply with the law regulation.

Taking into consideration the above mentioned, it is obvious that the predetermined goals within
the first subcomponent are achieved. Although the overall situation of the achievements is not
obvious at this point, as the software solution that should include all the cash benefits, the
financial management in the SWC and the MLSP as well as the statistical reporting and
integration of all that has been acquired so far, hasn’t been completely developed. This software
solution is not yet fully developed due to the termination of the Contract with the companies that
were to develop this software, which resulted in shortening of the deadline for the development
for the new Consortium due to the project ending, but the segments of the whole (software
solution) are well elaborated and all that is needed is they to be structured into new software
solution that will improve the targeting, decrease the possible abuse, decrease the time spent on
the social benefit administration, decrease the overburden on the employees in the SWC, enable
reorganization of the staff, improve the control and create appropriate data base that will be the
basis of the analysis needed for the amendments of the laws and also the analysis of the cash
benefits and their combination, all of this supported by the CCTP Project by engagement of an
international consultant.

Although not anticipated at the beginning, within the first component other activities were
realized and proved to be necessary. Namely, the following was supported and financed:


                                               57
 digitalization of the files on the social benefits, hiring of one local consultant in the Unit for
 Evaluation of Polices.

 The need for the digitalization of the data on the social benefits arouse during the project
 implementation. Taking into consideration that the cash benefits are administrated in different
 data bases and significant part of these are administrated manually, the digitalization of the data
 was a prerequisite for the new software solution. A company was hired to develop the forms for
 the data entry and additionally developed the interim solution for the CCTP EG administration
 which was reviewed and approved by the World Bank.

     Component 2 “Social Protection Program Support Component ?,
 Sub-component 2- “Information management systems and IT capacity strengthening?

 Achievements:

 Project objective No. 1 - Harmonization of data system across key institutions through
 development of data and technology standards, strengthening of the IT support capacity of key
 institutions, up-grade equipment and data communications network to enable data sharing and
 enhance framework for data flows among key departments and agencies and Project Objective
 No. 2 -Strengthening of information management infrastructure and information technology
 capacity of key institutions and departments.

Primary an IT consultant for development of technical standards, technical specifications,
procedures and activities that should support the implementation of modern, sustainable, flexible
informational systems for the MLSP and SWC and other institutions that will intercommunicate
the data in future was hired. During the consultant engagement, the consultant along with the
MLSP staff, the Pension Disability Fund, the Employment Agency, the State Revenue Office and
others developed around 80 technical standards.

The international consultant for business analysis with the support from the local consultant and in
cooperation with the IT Unit, the Financial Department, The Social Protection Department, the
Policy Evaluation Unit, the PMU and the SWC have prepared the technical specification for the
development of the software solution for the cash benefits and at the same time the local
consultant for the network design in cooperation with the IT Unit have prepared the technical
specification for the procurement of the network equipment for the MLSP and the SWC.

On the basis of the technical specification for development of the MIS for the cash benefits,
companies were selected (Joint Venture) for development of the software solution which in
accordance with the contract was supposed to be developed by the end of January year 2010.
Despite the dedication of the MLSP staff, the companies have failed to develop and deliver even a
single module of the complex software solution. This has not been caused by the MLSP in any
way but by other factors the MLSP couldn’t influence on. This claim is supported by the fact that
despite the termination of the contract for the development of the software solution, with the
companies by the MLSP, neither of them asked for arbitration by the authorized mediator nor have
they initiated a court procedure which is a common practice. Because of this MLSP had to open
new procurement procedure. In December, 2010, a new contract was signed with another
Consortium that due to the termination date of the project (25 of May 2011) were to develop the
software in very short time. Both, the MLSP and the Consortium were aware of the time limitation
on the development of such significant and complex system on one hand and on the other its
importance from the very beginning making the realization of the MIS their top priority. The



                                                 58
MLSP has formed 26 working groups composed by MLSP and SWC representatives. The
responsibilities of the working groups members are day to day cooperation, communication and
monitoring of the development of the software sub-modules thus ensuring timely and quality
software development. However, despite the dedication of the teams, it was concluded that the
time framework is a great obstacle for the testing and the operational acceptance of certain
modules and of the system as a whole. This situation was realized by the MLSP as well as the
World Bank representatives and an appropriate solution for overcoming of this situation was
encountered. This meant that one part of the Contract is transferred to the CCT Project, and an
Amendment with the Consortium for the time extension of the contract by the 20th of August 2011
followed. This time extension provides the time necessary to perform the testing and the
acceptance of the remaining modules of the system as a whole.

On the basis of the technical specification for procurement of network equipment, a company was
contracted for procurement and installation of the active and passive network equipment for the
SWCs and the MLSP. The network equipment is installed in the SWC and the MLSP but an
amendment for this contract is being prepared that will include additional SWCs that have not
existed at the time of the preparation of the technical specification and the signing of the contract.
The network equipment is installed and functioning in the SWCs and the MLSP, was used in the
digitalization process of the cash benefits files in the SWCs and is currently used for the
administration of the CCT and social services.

Equipping of the SWCs and the MLSP with the necessary IT equipment was done by the SPIL
project in two turns. For this purpose, 466 PCs, 101 scanners, 7 fax machines, 5 projectors, 411
printers were procured and other IT equipment. This provided appropriate IT equipment for the
SWC employees that will use the new software solution. Also 5 servers were procured that are
currently placed in the data center of the MLSP and are being used for the new software solution.

The connection between the SWCs and the MLSP is supported by internet connection for all the
SWCs and their local units.

In order to strengthen the IT unit in the MLSP that has only one employee, two other IT
consultants were engaged in this component and since recently both of them made part of the
permanent MLSP staff.

The above given shows that the goals set in the second component are fully achieved – the
effectiveness and the efficiency of the social protection system have been increased by simplifying
the system and introducing the approach of equalness in the new legal acts. The targeting has been
improved which is a process that can always be improved. The achievement of this goal can be
presented as simplified as possible through the number of the social financial assistance
beneficiaries in the period 2004-2010 ( The number of Social Financial Assistance in December
2004 was 66 940 households this number in December 2011 is decreased to 45138 households).
Strategies for social protection have been adopted. The decentralization and deinstitutionalization
processes have started and they have been positively assessed by the domestic and by the
international public. The Social Inspection Department has been formed that contributes to the
increase of the effectiveness and the efficiency of the social protection system as a whole as well
as proper targeting of the social benefits towards the most vulnerable groups. The MLSP and the
SWCs have been equipped with various technical equipment. The MLSP and the SWCs have been
connected and a unique data base for them has been created. This unique data base shall decrease
the possibility for any kind of abuse and will increase the control and will also enable the
performing of interconnection of the data bases of the rest of the relevant institutions in the future.



                                                  59
This interconnection with the data bases of the rest of the relevant institutions and data exchange
will minimize the possibility of abuse but will also alleviate the document provision process for
the applicants since the number of required documents they will need to submit themselves that
support their financial and health status shall decrease substantially. This unique data base shall
serve as basis for the creation of policies and analysis as well as combination of the financial
benefits in order to improve the social protection system. Despite the fact that the SPIL project has
fully accomplished the predetermined goals in the social protection area there is always space for
improvement. That is why the Government of Republic of Macedonia and the World Bank have
signed new Loan Agreement that will finance the Conditional Cash Transfer Project and the
achievements of the SPIL Project shall serve as a solid basis for the activities of the planned
activities under the Conditional Cash Transfer Project.

     1. CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THE WORLD
        BANK, AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

 Assessment of the WB performance during SPIL preparation and implementation:

The World Bank took important role during the SPIL implementation. The Bank provided the
PMU, the MLSP and the other involved agency’s staff with great assistance in achieving the
government’s goals. The WB helped the MLSP to make strategy for achieving the plans, and
provided continuous encouragement, and knowledge during the implementation of the goals.
The solutions of most of the problems which rose during the implementation came as a mutual
effort to the involved agencies and the WB staff.

     2. LESSONS LEARNED

Team effort and management support
When reforming system that reflects several institutions, the clear role of each institution in the
reform is critical. Assigning team comprised of representatives from all the institutions, who have
clear vision about the goals, strong commitment and management support, is key for success of
this kind of reforms.
On the other hand it is also critical to have PMU staffed with qualified persons that coordinate all
the work, and make sure that the institutions have all the needed support.

Stability for success: The PMU staff was not changed during the project.

Management Information system- Developing a system that will automate the business processes
requires strong commitment from the management and delegated authority to the designated team
that works with the development company, to make decisions on a daily basis about the content of
the software. Although the business processes are part of each contract for software development,
some of the details need to be defined during the development, and here it is critical that the
assigned team has knowledge and a authority to make decisions about the details of the software.
Although, the development of software for government institutions should take phase approach i.e.
separate software development by institutions, because building a massive system that covers a
several institutions in a same time is very risky and difficult, at the end the separate software
should be connected, covering all the institutions that need to exchange data. Only on this way we
will modernize the system and automate the business processes that at the end will provide quality
services to the citizens, and true management control to the government.

                               61
 Comments from MLSP to the Draft Implementation Completion and Results Report (ICR) of
                the Social Protection Implementation Loan 4732 – MK

1. Point 28, section 1.7 “Other significant changes?, built 2

The second amendment includes increasing of disbursement percentage of eligible expenditures
to 100 % only for the disbursement category goods, consultants and training. The percentage of
disbursement category for the incremental operating costs was not changed and it remained 25%
from the World Bank funds and 75% from Government contribution

2. Point 43 from the section 2.2 “Implementation?

The delays in the development of the CB MIS were not caused only by the one failed
procurement attempt (in the ICT it is stated that there were two failed procurement attempts), but
also because of the contract termination with the first selected contractor. Namely, according to
the contract signed with the first selected contractor the CB MIS should have been developed till
15.11.2009. Afterwards two time extensions of the contract have been signed, according to which
the CB MIS should have been developed till 15.03.2010. The contract has been terminated on
24.03.2010 when it was obvious that the contractor will not develop the software. The selection
process for the new contractor took app. 7 months with one failed procurement attempt in the
middle.

3. Point 47 from the section 2.2 “Implementation?

The delays in the CB MIS development were not the only cause for the two extensions of the
project closing date. The details of the time extensions are presented in point 28 of this ICR.

4. Point 58 from the section 2.3 ?Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and
Utilization?

The dates for quantitative outcome indicator for the PDO, “increased share of Social Assistance
expenditure going to the bottom two deciles (bottom quintile) by at least 3%?, have been
provided on a regular basis to the World Bank SPIL team by MLSP from the beginning of the
project. Why these data are not monitored in the World Bank ISRs from the first ICR stays
unclear for the MLSP.

5. Point 60 from the section 2.3 ?Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and
Utilization?

The MLSP SPIL team has never been informed that during the Mid-Term Review the new
indicator “the reduction of social worker time spent on social benefits administration? has been
introduced. About this action the MLSP was informed during the first ICR team visit.
