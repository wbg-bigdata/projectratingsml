                             RESTRUCTURING PAPER




SUMMARY
The proposed restructuring includes: (i) extending the Closing Date of the Loan by
eleven months; (ii) increasing the disbursement percentage of eligible expenditures to
100%; and (iii) reallocating funds within categories of Schedule 1 of the Loan
Agreement. The proposed restructuring does not involve the introduction of new
activities, or revisions of the project development objectives, outcomes, design, or scope.

The eleven month extension is requested to ensure full utilization of the Loan proceeds
for completion of the two critical software packages which are essential for the full
accomplishment of the PDO. The increase of disbursement percentage to 100 percent for
all expenditure categories was requested due to the reduction in the Central budget funds
and inability of the Ministry of Finance to ensure timely contribution to some activities.
Finally, the proposed reallocation of expenditures reflects adjustments during the course
of implementation.

Should management agree to the proposed changes, the Bank's team requests that two
separate letters be signed, one extending the Closing Date of the Loan --which becomes
effective upon the Country Director's signature-- and another addressing points (ii) and
(iii) above, which require Government's counter-signature to become effective. The
decision to inform the Government through two separate letters ensures that the Project
would be extended on a timely manner, even if there are delays in counter-signing the
amendment letter.


PROJECT STATUS
Implementation of the activities shows visible progress with majority of the activities
either already completed or close to completion. The Project's Development Objective is
rated as Moderately Satisfactory and disbursement has reached 72.5 percent.
Implementation Performance is also rated as Moderately Satisfactory. There are no
overdue audits under the Project. The 2009 audit is expected to be received by the due
date. Audits of prior years have been submitted to the World Bank by the agreed
deadlines and had clean opinions.

The key challenges that remain under the Project are the completion of purchase and
implementation of two software packages--the Pension resolution and payment software
(PRPS) and the Integrated Cash Benefit MIS (CB MIS), essential for the monitoring of

                                            4
the benefit systems. The Bank team's assessment is that for both of these softwares to be
completed, tested and delivered, an additional eleven months would be required.



PROPOSED CHANGES
      Financing - Increase in Disbursement Percentage

On December 29, 2009, the Ministry of Finance requested an amendment of Schedule 1
to the Loan Agreement, in order to increase the disbursement percentage to 100 percent
for all expenditure categories. This request was made for all lending projects in the
Bank's portfolio in Macedonia, as there has been a reduction of state budget and the
Government does not have the funds to cover their contribution. At the same time, this
restructuring proposes that the disbursement percentage for Category (4) (Incremental
Operating Costs) remains as approved by the Board, to ensure that the Government
continues to absorb these expenditures on an increasing basis. It should be noted that as
the Government's original contribution was estimated at US$1.38 million and the Project
has already disbursed 72 percent, this implies an approximate reduction in the overall
project cost of less than 4 percent. That reduction would be off-set by project savings
accumulated during implementation, thus not causing a reduction in the scope of project
activities. The Loan amount and the terms or conditions of the loan would not change.

The reduction of project costs is shown in table 1 below.

      Reallocations

This restructuring also proposes a reallocation of loan proceeds across expenditure
category, as listed in Table 2 below.

      Extension to Closing Date

The proposed extension of the closing date would enable the Government to finalize
ongoing activities which are critical for the achievement of the Project's development
objective. In particular, the additional eleven months would enable for: (i) the
completion of the ongoing development of software solutions for the Pension Resolution

                                           6
and Payment System (PRPS) which has been delayed due to unexpected revisions in the
mapping of the business processes in the Pension Fund; and (ii) the development of the
software solutions for the integrated Cash Benefit MIS critical for improved targeting and
administration of cash benefits, and also essential for the launch of the Conditional Cash
Transfer for secondary education grants. The design of this software was delayed as the
firm hired to develop it did not deliver the expected work, leading the Government to
terminate the contract in March 2010; a new procurement process is underway to hire
another firm to do the work. However, it is not possible for this to be done within the
current timeframe.

This would be the second extension of the Project's closing date, for a total of 23 months.
Should the eleven month extension be granted, the Closing Date of the Loan would be
moved from June 30, 2010 to May 31, 2011.


      Implementation schedule

The Borrower has prepared an implementation plan for the completion of the remaining
project activities as well as a revised procurement plan reflecting the proposed eleven
month extension. Both documents were found acceptable to the Bank's team. Based on
the above, the Bank team's assessment is that within the anticipated extension, the PDO
is likely to be achieved.
