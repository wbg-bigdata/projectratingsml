PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
PERU
CHANCHAMAYO-SATIPO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 2396-PE)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Chanchamayo-Satipo
Rural Development Project (PDRCS) in Peru, for which Loan 2396-PE of US$40.0 million
was approved on March 27, 1984, and became effective on August 9, 1984. The Bank
Loan was suspended on May 12, 1987, and closed on June 30, 1990.   The final
disbursement was on July 15, 1987. Some US$7.2 million was disbursed and US$32.8
million was cancelled.
The PCR (ES, Parts I and III) was prepared by the FAO/IBRD Cooperative
Program on behalf of the Agricultural OperaLions Division, Latin America Country
Depa:rtment I. Part II, although requested, has not been received from the Borrower.
Parts I and III are based on the Staff Appraisal Report, the Loan
Agreement, the President's Report, Supervision Reports, correspondejnce between the
Bank and the Borrower, internal Bank Memoranda, the Project's Financial Statements
and Audit Reports and Progress Reports prepared by the Borrower.   For security
reasons, the PCR mission was not able to visit the project area, and therefore could
not confirm the validity of the information recorded on implementation achievements.

PERU
CHAICHAMAYO-SATIrO RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
(Loan 2396-PE)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Obiectives
1.          The principal objective of the project was to increase agricultural and
forestry production in the Chanchamayo-Satipo area of the central Peruvian jung:e
highlands east of Lima.  The project aimed at improving productivity, income and
living conditions for about 20,000 families, including 2,000 native Akerindian
families, in the area. Principal compo.._nts of the project were: (a) provision of
extension, credit and other agricultural support services - including marketing; (b)
improvement of about 427 km of rural roads and provision of associated maintenance
equipment; (c) provision of land titles; (d) improvement of forestry management; (e)
assistance for native communities; and (f) support for project management, studies
and technical assistance in various fields.
Implementation Experience
2.          The project became effective in August 1984.  Initial implementation
progress was very slow due mainly to local funding constraints. Project progress
improved in late 1986 but slowed after May 1987 when the Bank suspended all loan
disbursements to Peru due to non-payment of the debt service.  As a result only
US$7.2 million out of a total loan of US$40 million were disbursed. The Government,
however, continued tc support the project by providing US$7.8 million which were
mostly used to continue payment of staff salaries.   Investments remained very
limited.
3.          The main problem in project implementation was the failure of the Banco
Agrario (BAP) to disburse credit to participating farmers. Although the required
agreement between the BAP and the Executive Directorate (ED) of the project became
effective in 1984, only one percent of the targeted loan amount of US$20.6 million
w1s  disbursed.    This  was  due  mainly  to  financial  constraints,  as  BAP  had
d .fficulties in obtaining the required funds from Treasury, but possibly also due
to farmers' eligibility problems. As provision of credit was an important element
of the development strategy to rehabilitate, expand and intensify perennial and
annual crop plantings, the failure to implement this component heavily constrained
all other production or.ented efforts, in particular those of extension and
research.
4.          Besides these key constraints, implementation was further hampered by
guerilla incursions after 1988 and illegal forest clearing by coca planters. The



- iv -
deteriorating security situation not only affected farming activities but also
hampered project monitoring and supervision.
Pro-ect Reou .s
5.          Due to  inadequate project monitoring  no reliable agriculture  and
forestry production data aro available.   Indications,  however,  are that only
fractions of the SAR targets were achieved, as was to be expected giveon the fact
that the project was not completed.   The project's main objective,  namely to
increase crop production, was met only to a l4mited extent. As a result of this and
because of guerilla activities and intensified forest clearing by coca planters, the
project did little to improve the nutritional situation of the native communities
in the project area and to control deforestation.  Isolated achievements such as
limited improvement to infrastructure, land titling, the organization of farmers,
market committees and the promotion of "chacras integrales" (integrated farming
systems) are noteworthy but of little significance in face of the overall lack of
results. At appraisal the economic rate of return (ERR) was estimated at over 18%,
based only on quantifiable benefits from incremental crop and forest production.
As only less than 20% of the loan was disbursed and benefits could not be
quantified, no attempt was made to re-estimate the ERR.
SustainL"ilitv
6.          The implementation experience has demonstrated that under the prevailing
socio-economic anC political situation, even basic agricultural services such as
extension and research cannot be sustained. Unless a specific effort is made by
Government, even the limited development achievements of the project will be lost.
This applies especially to roads, bridges, buildings and water supply systems which
are already affected by lack of maintenance and repairs.
Findinos and Lessons Learned
7.          Owing to the drastically reduced disbursement and weak mon.itoring,
findings and lessons are rather limited. The need for a project of this kind was
unquestionable and in general the project appears to have been well designed,
responding to the development needs of the area. It could not have been foreseen
at appraisal that the socio-economic and political circumstances would deteriorate
to a level which effectively prevented project implementation.   It emerges very
clearly, however, that the institutional and operational arrangements for the
channelling of credit to farmers were not sufficiently well defined to allow an
appropriate flow of funds. As the successful achievement of the main objectives of
the project hinged on the availability of farm credit, its provision should have
been more forcefully pursued by the Bank at an early stage. The main lesson learned
from project implementation is that whenever a project depends exclusively on non-
loan sources for the financing of essential components, firm agreements on the
provision of such funds have to be in place at start-up, with advance funding
already earmarked.

-     Sector:            Agriculture
2.    Background
2.1.        The agricultural sector in Peru suffered a major decline during the
1970s.   While the population grew by 2.8% p.a.  (4.1%  in the urban areas),
agricultural production decreased by 0.6% p.a. in real terms, food imports increased
by 20% over the decade, while agricultural exports plunged by 78% and agricultural
GDP fell from 15% of the total in 1970 to 11% in 1982.  This was due partly to
severe droughts between 1970 and 1980, but mainly because of adverse Government
policies which included a sweeping land reform, inadequate agricultural input and
output pricing policies, imposition of an inefficient state-run marketing system,
insufficient credit, deficient extension and research support, and the concentration
of public investment in large-scale coastal irrigation projects with very long
gestation periods.
2.2.        By the late 1970s, the military Government had recognized the gravity
of the problems and began introducing measures to reverse this trend. This effort
was accelerated by the Belaunde Government from 1980 on, and included, among others,
the elimination of consumer subsidies; increased farmgate prices; the strengthening
of credit and support services; provision of investment incentives; and the
privatization of import, export and marketing of most agricultural inputs and
products.   While the  impact of these measures  resulted  in a 14% growth of
ayricultural output between 1980 and 1982, it was clear that further growth would
be constrained Dy the limited resource base in Peru's traditional production areas,
namely the Costa and the Sierra, and that further expansion would only be possible
by developing the Ceja de Selva with its 4.5 million km2 of fertile lands, of which
only 0.6 million km2 are being exploited. The development of this area was declared
first priority and four projects, two in the Mayo Valley in Northern Peru and two
in the Selva Central, east of Lima, were launched under the responsibility of the
National Development Institute (INADE), a cabinet-level agency. The Chanchamayo-
Satipo project is located in the Selva Central where INADE'e Pichis-Palcazu office
(PEPP) was implementing two other development projects with USAID and IDB
assistance.



- 2-
3.    Project Obiectives and Description
3.1.        The Chanchamayo-Satipo Rural Development Project (PDRCS) was the second
Bank assisted rural development project in the Ceja de Selva, after the Alto Mayo
project which had been approved in March 1983. The project area included 730,000
ha of valleys ranging from 500-3,000 m above sea level, of which about 400,000 ha
were settled land and 330,000 ha were thinly populated steep slopes.   Total
population was 160,000, of which 80% rural.   The project's objectives were to:
(i) improve incomes and living conditions for about 20,000 rural families by
expanding local agricultural (mainly fruit crops) and forestry production; and
(ii) improve the region's infrastructure base.   Some 5,500 farming families --
including over 500 Amerindian families -- were to participate direct:y in the
agricultural development components, whereas all 20,000 families were expected to
benefit from the infrastructure improvements in the area.   The project was to
coordinate area development so that the physical environment would be protected and
local native communities would be incorporated into the development.
3.2.        The project included the following main components:
(a)   an agricultural credit program for the 'irmers in the area;
(b)   ccnstruction  and improvement of access roads and support  for the
establishment of a road maintenance program;
(c)   provision of complementary production support activities,  including
agricultural research and extension services and marketing facilities;
(d)   strengthening forestry manage,nent and conservation;
(e)   land titling;
(f)   improvement of living conditions of the native communities; and
(h)   support  for project management  as well  as  studies  and technical
assistance.
3.3.        Total project cost was estimated at appraisal at US$67.5 million, of
wh_ch the Bank loan was to finance US$40.0 million (59%), including US$15.6 million
in foreign exchange, front-fee, and US$24.3 million in local costs.  The remaining
US$27.5 million were to be provided by the Government, the Banco Agrario (BAP) and
beneficiaries. Agricultural credit accounted for 31% of project costs; access roads
for another 31%; production support services for 16% (research/extension 12% and
marketing 4%); forestry 7%; land titling 7%; and project management 6%.  Direct
support to the native communities accounted for the remaining 2%, but was also
included in all the above components.
3.4.        INADE was to be responsible for general coordination and direction of
the project.   PEPP was to be directly responsible for executing all components
except for credit, research/extension and forestry, which were to be carried out
respectively by BAP,  INIPA and INFOR,  through formal  agreements.   A project



management unit in La Merced was to be in charge of day-to-day implementation, while
a liaison office in Lima would ensure inter-ministerial coordination. The Ministry
of Transport and Communication (MTC) was to assist the project in technical issues
concerning road activities.
4.    Project Design and Organization
4.1.        The project wan qenerally well prepared, its rationale responded to the
Government's policy to expand agriculture by developing the Ceja de Selva, and its
design translated a concern for development in harmony with a balanced
environmental base and with the needs of the numerous tribal communities established
in the area.
4.2.        The organization and management arrangements were adequately inserted
in the existing institutional framewor'.  Most project problems are attributable
rather to the generally adverse socic-economic condition than to design or
management deficiercies. Un cecedented economic recession and inflation, together
with serious funding problems, aggravated by the early interruption of Bank
financing, hindered normal implementation and achievement of project objectives.
These could not have been foreseen at the time of project preparation and appraisal.
S.    Project Implementation
5.1.        The project became effective in August 1984 and its implementation was
characterized by a very slow start, due to serious counterpart budget cuts which had
also delayed Bank disbursements.  An apparent improvement in late 1986 was soon
frustrated by the suspension of all Bank loan disbursements to Peru in May 1987 due
to non-payment of the debt service. Total loan disbursements amounted to US$7.2
million (18% of the loan) and US$32.8 million was canceled. The Bank loan closed
on June 30, 1990, as foreseen.   In spite of the suspension of the loan, the
Government continued to support the project activities by providing US$7.8 million
out of its own budget, which was proportionally far in excess ot the SAR financing
plan (see Part III, Table 5B).  This allowed the project to continue payment of
staff salaries, but investments remained very limited. Besides the curtailing of
loan funds, the failure of BAP to provide credit to project farmers seriously
reduced their ability to adopt improved production technology (see paras. 5.2 and
5.4). Total actual project costs were about US$15.0 million, equivalent to 22% of
SAR estimates.  However, in spite of th *e difficulties, the project managed to
achieve some results mainly in terms of infrastructure construction and services.
Its economic impact is impossible to measure due to lack of reliable data.
5.2.        Agricultural credit, although vital for the attainment of SAR production
tazgets, was not financed by the loan. It was to be provided by eAP (using Bank
Loan 2302-PE and other funds), through a subsidiary agreement which became effective
in late 1984. The targets established by the agreement included 4,370 long-term and
770 short-term loans, amounting to US$17.8 and US$2.8 million, respectively.
However, while about 3,300 loan requests had been prepared by the project, BAP
provided only about US$240,000 (1% of estimates) to project farmers. This was due
mainly to funding constraints, as BAP had difficulties in obtaining the expected



-4-
amounus from the Treasury.  Farmers' lack of eligibtlity and/or creditworthiness may
have been another reason. Detailed statistics are not available, but the financing
of only 138 ha of coffee rehabilitation and 37 ha of new citrus crops, againnt the
expected 14,000 ha and 1,150 h3 respectively, illustrate the poor performance of the
PEPP-BAP agreemeat on the provision of credit, which ceased to operate in 1988.
5.3.        The marketina component consisted of the const-uction of two fruit
packing centers with an annual capacity of 14,000 tons each, and technical
assistance to operate them. The centers were not established, due mainly to the
weakness of the Semiautonomous Agricultural Marketing Agency (PROCOMPr',A) under the
Ministry of Agriculture to which the project had delegated their implementation.
However, the project trained farmers in marksting techniques and helped them, as
well  as the Amerindian  communities,  to organize marka:ing  cor. '.ttees end to
establish retail marketing points in free fairs in the project urban centers and in
Lima.
5.4.        Rural extension was  initially very weak due to the institutional
problems of the National Institute for Agricultural Research and Extension (INIPA),
but improved after having been taken over by the project in 1986. However, owing
to lac'. of credit (see para. 5.2), technical advice to farmers had little impact ana
the transfer of improved technology was limiteu.  The extension servics, however,
successfully promoted the development of "chacras integrales", an approach that
sought to blend crop and livestock activities on the farms, with the objective o_7
ensuring farmers' subsistence while generating some surpluses for the market. It
appears that, under the given economic environment, this proved to be an appropriate
solution and was widely accepted. Extension also promoted the organization of 36
farmers' committees which were effective in improving produce marketing. It also
helped to improve food production among the native communitias, although this effort
was soon neutralized Ly guerrilla incursions (see para. 5.9). However, for lack of
adequate funding and the consequent desertion of staff, the extension service
deteriorated and practically ceased to operate after 1988.
5.5.        Research was carried out, through an agreement with the University of
La Molina, in two experimental stations in the project area. It was effective up
to  1987,  after which  it was  phased out due to  funding  constraints.    Main
achievements were the introduction, although on a very limited scale, of improved
varieties of citrus, avocados and macadamia; the introdur ion of the achiote crop;
the identification of crop diseases and their control; a c the improved management
of old coffee stands.
5.6.        Forestry.  About 1,400 "a, benefitting 668 farmers, were reforested,
some minor surveys and experiments  jre carried out, and four forest police posts
(versus the appraisal target of 6) and two nurseries (100% of target) were
constructed under this component.  However, the agreements between the project and
the National Forestry Institute (INFCR) and the Forest Police were of limited
effectiveness as a resnilt of lack of funds. Therefore little was accomplished to
control accelerated deforestation connected with the expansion of the agricultural
frontier.
5.7.        Roads.   The project constructed a loom-long bridge over the Perene
river, and constructed or improved about 186 km of access roads (44% of SAR



estimates), while road m3intenance was neglected due to l,ck of funds.   As a
consequence, project roads deteriorated very rapidly, increasing the cost of
transport of prod _ts to the markets and causing a reduction in the farmersI income.
5.8.        wand titlina was one of the nroject's most successful components.
Through agreemento with Regi6n Agraria XVI-Junin, INFOR, and the Directorate of
Cadastre, the project issued 7,384 individual land titles (49% of estimates) and 84
titles to tribal comnunities (99% of the appraisal estimate of 85). In addition,
95 (against an SAR target of 85) Amerindian reserves were demarcated.
5.9.        Native Communities.  This component aimed essentially to assist the 85
communities (about 2,000 families) established in the project area by improving
their living conditions and raising their nutritional level which had been seriously
affected over the last several years by increased deforestation. To achieve this
objective, the project set up a separate bilingual extension service through which
292 "promoters of development" were trained, and started a technical assistance
program to diversify and increase agricultural production, introduce livestock
activities, promote craftsmanship, organize marketing channels, and improve the
sanitary and nutritional conditions of these communities. Some 800 families out of
the estimated 2,000 were assisted, with promising results.   However, increased
funding constraints after 1987, exacerbated guerrilla incursions and a continuing
deforestation brought about a decline in the nutritional level of about half of the
native population.
5.10.       Proiect Management.   The effectiveness of project management, which
included qualified and motivated staff, was seriously constrained by constant
funding difficulties. Foreseen investments, already limited during the first three
years of the project, were discontinued altogether after loan suspension, when
funding became so critical that staff had to be progressively reduced from 430 in
1987 to 260 in 1988, to 90 in 1989 and to 60 in 1990.
6.    Results
6.1.        The failure of BAP to provide long-term credit for rehabilitation and
expansion of perennial crops and short-term credit for the intensification of annual
crops rendered extension efforts practically  ineffective.   Unfortunately,  no
reliable cLop production data are available, but, from the failure of the credit
component and the limited effectiveness of the extension component, it may be
concluded that the main project objectives were not achieved (see also paras. 5.2
and 5.4).  The situation was further aggravated by constant counterpart funding
constraints from the beginning of the project, compounded by the suspension of Bank
loan disbursements. Isolated achievements, such as improvements to jnfrastructure,
land titling, the organization of farmers' marketing committees and the promotion
of "chacras integrales", are of little significance in light of the overall results.
6.2.        Crucial social and environmental issues which the project intended to
resolve actually became worse during the implementation period. Owing to funding
constraints and the intrusion of guerrillas who sequestered crops and animals, the
living conditions, including the nutritional situation of the many native
communities in the area, are now actually poorer than prior to the project. For



similar reasonz, and due to intensified forest clearing by coca planters, the
attempts to control deforestation wers not successful, thus contributing to a
deterioratioi of the environment.
6.3.        At appraisal, the Economic Rate of Return (ERR) estimated at about
18.6%, was based only on quantifiable benefits from crop and forest production.
However, as less than 20% of tha loan was disbursed and only negligible credit was
provided to farmers, ve.^y few benefits could be claimed by the project.   Data
available on incremental crop and forest production are insufficient to allow a
meaningful assessment of p_:oject benefits,  ;isrefore no attempt was made to carry
out a re-estimation of the ERR.
7.    Proiect Sustainabilitv
7.1.        Due to the above adverse implementation conditions, the project failed
to build a basis for sustainable development.  In facz, the environmental situation
and the nutritional and living conditions of some of the Amerindian communities,
which the project intended to improve, visibly deteriorated during implementation.
Furthermore, expanding narcotrafficking contributed to diverting farmers from
project-proposed development objectives to apparently more profitable coca cropping.
Therefore, unless adequate financial, technical and security services are provided
to the project area, it is likely that even the limited achievements of the project
will be lost.
8.    Bank Performance
8.1.        The SAR could not foresee the rapid deterioration of Peru's economy
which seriously affected project implementation.  Technical, ecological and other
risks, such as those deriving from conflicts between settlers and Amerindians, were
adequately considered. Financial disruptions caused by disbursement suspension, as
well as drug activities and terrorism,  could not have been predicted.   Bank
supervision missions detected early the main political, technical and financial
issues and problems, and rated the project accordingly. The Bank, however, failed
to resolve the issue of farm development credit by enforcing the adherence and
implementation of the creCit agreement between INADE and BAP, which was ratified by
GOP.
9.    Borrower Performance
9.1.        The Borrower's unilateral decision to interrupt debt service payments,
which led the Bank to suspend loan disbureements, seriously compromised project
implementation.   Because of the Borrower's failure to substitute fully for the
suspended loan financing and the mounting social unrest in the country, project
activities declined sharply.   The Borrower's inability/unwillingness to provide
funds for farm credit hinde:ed the expansion of agricultural production, and
prevented the project from attaining its main objective.   Changes in national
strateg'ies and priorities which reaulted in reduced counterpart funding as well as
deteriorated transport conditions, were equally detrimental to project performance.



Due to the exceptionally adverse socio-economic circumstances and the fact that less
than a quarter of the loan was disbursed, no useful lessons could be learned from
the implementation experience, except that the combined effect of unstable
macroeconomic conditions, social unrest and narcotraffic on a project prevents its
efficient and effective implementation.
10.   Pro-ect '~elationship
10.1.       Except  for the suspension of loan disbursements by the Bank,  all
decisions affecting the project were made under a common understanding of problems
and constraints between the Bank and the Borrower, with the shared objective of
ensuring successful project implementation. However, the relationship between local
institutions was frequently unsatisfactory, particularly between the project and
BAP, and was detrimental to the implementation of the project's credit component,
and, consequently the attainment of production targets.
11.   Consulting Services
11.1.       Funding for consulting services was available for training, engineering,
road maintenance,  forestry, and project evaluation.   However, due to budgetary
constraints, external technical assistance was hired only for engineering activities
related to project infrastructure, particularly roads.
12.   Prolect Documentation and Data
12.1.       Project covenants as well as project organization and management were
clearly stipulated. The project and its SAR were based on satisfactory baseline
data.  However, due to the severe funding constraints and limited access to the
project area, monitoring of project performance was insufficient to allow a
realistic assessment of project achievements and impact.

Comrnents: The statistics of Table 4 must be regarded with caution, as discontinuation of project activities neutralized most
achievements, particularly: 1. Extension. Assistance to farmers (a) and crop areas (b) was eventually te  nated because
of lack of funds, and results were not adequately monitored. As for rural credit supervision (c), extension j.,epared 3,228
individual proposals for bank financing, but only about 7 percent of the requests were effectively financed by BAP. 2.
Native communities. The achievements of this component were to a large extent neutralized by guerrilla activities, assistance
was discontinued for lack of funds and results were limited.

l/        Total project costs were substantially below SAR estimates due to slow
project start-up and loan suspension after July 1987. The failure of the
BAP to provide credit to participating farmers has further decreased project
costs. No reliable data is available to re-evaluate the foreign exchange
component, therefore SAR percentages were applied.

Comments: Any differences due to rounding. Loan disbursements were suspended in May
July 1987. The failure of the BAP to provide credit to project farmers resulted in a
corresponding lack of contribution by producer associations and farmers. The
Govemment, however, increased its percentage contribution to allow at least completion of
essential infrastructure and recruitment of staff, as well as operating costs.

Table 6: PROJECT RESULTS
Not applicable. Due to severe funding constraints project investments were only
partially accomplished, activities were curtailed and objectives were jeopardized. Moreover,
because of lack of reliable production data due to deficient monitoring and limited access to the
project area because of civil unrest, results could not be realistically assessed.
