F. Results Framework Analysis

Program Development Objective:

The objectives of the three operations in this DPO series were to: (a) ensure predictable and
sustainable financing for the forest and wildlife sectors and effective forest law enforcement; (b)
improve mining sector revenue collection, management, and transparency; (c) address social issues
in forest and mining communities; and (d) mainstream environment into economic growth through
Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and
development of a climate change strategy.

Revised Program Development Objective:

No substantive changes (see section 1.3).

The PDO indicators below are taken from 3-year outcomes identified under the 1st operation
(DPO-1), and substantially revised as the Key Outcome Indicators during the preparation of DPO-
2. However, the outcome indicators were not given appropriate attention during the remainder of
the DPO series and therefore do not fully reflect the agreed triggers. Section 2.1 presents the PDO
indicators alongside the triggers for a clearer understanding of the disconnect between the two and
the achievements in focal areas of the Program.

1.   Program Context, Development Objectives and Design:

1.1.Context at Appraisal

Macro-economic Context

1. The first development policy operation (DPO-1) was prepared in the context of a strong
macroeconomic performance with GDP growth at 6.3 percent in 2007, down slightly from 6.4 percent in
2006. Performance was driven by several sectors (mining, finance and insurance and real estate,
construction and in services), which greatly outweighed the output declines in other sectors (such as
manufacturing, electricity and water production). Stimulus was also provided by fiscal policy, with
government services rising by 6 percent, and yielding an additional 1 percent of real GDP growth.

2. Additionally, export revenues increased due to a continuous rise in prices for cocoa and gold by 60 and
125 percent respectively over the previous seven years. However, despite a good performance of the export
sector as well as positive net capital inflows, the surge in imports (attributed in particular to a 17 percent
increase in oil and non-oil imports) led to a weakening in the country‟s external position. The current
account deficit widened to 12 percent of GDP (including official transfers) in 2007, from 10 percent in
2006.

3. Since the second half of 2006, government expenditures have risen faster than revenue collections,
leading the overall fiscal deficit to reach 7.5 percent of GDP in 2006. The main driver of growth in
government spending has been the public sector wage bill and energy sector subsidies. Nevertheless,
government spending maintained its pro-poor orientation in 2007 at 9.4 percent, though slightly lower than
in 2006 (10.5 percent) but up from 8.5 percent in 2005.

4. Fiscal and balance of payments factors have influenced the interest and exchange rates. Between
September 2007 and mid March 2008, the exchange rate (Cedis to the US$) declined by 5.2 percent (against
an already declining US Dollar), prompting the Bank of Ghana to increase its prime rate twice over the
same period to 14.2 percent by mid March 2008. Meanwhile, the consumer price index rose from 10.9
percent in 2006 to 12.7 percent by end of 2007, driven by external supply-side shocks (e.g. higher crude oil
prices, higher imported food prices) and internal pressures (e.g. higher food prices following the drought
and flood in northern Ghana and adjustments in utility tariffs).

5. At the start of implementation of the DPO series, the Ghanaian economy continued its strong GDP
growth performance (7.3 percent in 2008), driven by a surge in export revenues and sustained public and
private domestic demand for goods and services. Estimates for 2009 and 2010 suggested a significant
slowing of GDP growth (down to an average of 4 percent), due to the global slowdown and decelerated
domestic demand, and through the combined impact of fiscal stabilization, tighter credit conditions, and
lower remittances and foreign direct investment. Continued fiscal expansion in 2008, combined with
exogenous shocks led to a fiscal deficit of 15.5 percent. In response, the Government adopted a multi-year
fiscal stabilization plan, supported by the IMF, with complementary support is provided by the Bank‟s
Economic Governance and Poverty Reduction Credit (EGPRC). Government has faced some fiscal and
balance of payments challenges during the course of the NREG Program, especially with the advent of the
crisis, but has responded through sound planning in coordination with key development partners.

Sector background

6. Ghana‟s growth has historically been fueled by natural resources. At preparation, the forestry, wildlife
and mining sectors accounted for 15 percent of Ghana‟s GDP, 25 percent of Government revenues, 60



                                                      1
percent of foreign exchange, and significant employment. Over 70 percent of the population was dependent
on natural resources for their basic food, water, and energy requirements. However, absence of effective
regulatory institutions, lack of effective inter-sectoral collaboration among the natural resources sectors and
weak mechanisms for citizen participation led to institutional inefficiencies and put both sustainability and
long-term economic growth at risk. Ghana‟s resources were being depleted at an alarming rate: (i) 50
percent of the original forest has been converted to agriculture, while timber and non-timber forest products,
and biodiversity were in serious decline; (ii) mining and forestry revenues were suspected not to be well
captured; and declining environmental quality has affected the quality of life and productivity of Ghana‟s
population, notably through air pollution and inadequate clean water supply and sanitation. According to
the findings of the Country Environmental Analysis (CEA)2, the high rate of natural resource degradation
represented an annual cost of about 10 percent of GDP, representing almost half of Ghana‟s US$ 1.5 billion
annual Official Development Assistance.3

7. In this context, the Government of Ghana (GoG) decided to launch a five-year Natural Resources and
Environmental Governance (NREG) 2008-2012 program to address governance issues related to the mining
and forestry sector and to improve environmental management with the overall objective of ensuring
economic growth, poverty alleviation, increasing revenues and improving environmental protection.

Rationale for Bank assistance & contribution to higher level objectives

8. The Bank‟s involvement in NREG built upon on support already provided for natural resources
management and the environment over the previous decade, centered around the Natural Resources
Management Project (NRMP) and two related GEF grants – the High Forest Biodiversity Conservation
Project and the Northern Savanna Biodiversity Conservation Project. NRMP was envisaged as a 10-year, 3-
phase APL, but was discontinued after the initial 2-year phase because the structure of the project was
considered to be too complex, and policy and governance gaps limited the effectiveness of project
investments4. A renewed policy dialogue, anchored in a series of analytical studies shared among key
development partners, was considered necessary to identify and lay the groundwork to overcome the
systemic weaknesses (see summary of background analysis in section 2.2). Involvement of the Bank was
seen as critical in order to convene support of the other DPs, not only through its financial contribution, but
also due to the Bank‟s experience in policy lending for the natural resources and environment (NRE),
including DPOs in Cameroon and Gabon, as well as a multi-sector NRE DPOs in Brazil, Colombia,
Mexico, and Peru.

9. The program was consistent with Government‟s national priorities as described in the 2006-2009 2nd
Growth and Poverty Reduction Strategy (GPRS II), and was intended to complement the EGPRC DPO
series, allowing greater focus on natural resource and environmental policy issues. The GPRS II laid the
foundation for the NREG program with the Government‟s commitment to reducing environmental
degradation and identified priorities for environmental management through an SEA for each of the GPRS
II key pillars (private sector competitiveness, human resource development, and good governance and civil

  Out of the total US$730 million costs of lost productivity due to damage to five classes of natural assets (agriculture
land, forest and savanna woodlands, coastal fisheries and wetlands, wildlife, and Lake Volta) and of damages to
human health (incurred from urban air pollution, indoor air pollution and inadequate potable water supply, sanitation
and hygiene), the two highest costs are from timber depletion (US$270 million) and inadequate potable water supply,
sanitation and hygiene (US$180 million).

  NRMP ICR (2003): “There were several serious flaws in project design, however that were largely responsible for
the problems encountered during Project implementation. . . Project design failed to identify as a risk, that it would be
very difficult to complete the myriad of policy reforms in a complex sector such as Forestry in 2 years. Thus, the
project was overly ambitious given the number of activities in each sub-component, the number of co-financiers and
the weak human capacity?

responsibility). NREG was also aligned with the 2008-2011 CAS which has a substantial section on
sustainable management of natural resources as well as a number of specific priorities aligned with the
NREG Program, including: (a) transparent fiscal and revenue frameworks in natural resources management;
(b) the analysis and governance of extractive industries through a value chain approach; (c) engagement and
dialogue with civil society organizations and local communities; (d) increased coordination between natural
resource/environment ministries and agencies; (e) increased attention to climate change mitigation and
adaptation; and (f) sound environmental management of the oil and gas sectors.

1.2         Original Program Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators (as approved)

10. The objectives of the three operations in the DPO series were to: (a) ensure predictable and sustainable
financing for the forest and wildlife sectors and effective forest law enforcement; (b) improve mining sector
revenue collection, management, and transparency; (c) address social issues in forest and mining
communities; and (d) mainstream environment into economic growth through Strategic Environmental
Assessment (SEA), Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), and development of a climate change
strategy.

11. The PDO indicators are based on the six key outcome indicators identified in the DPO-2 & -3 program
documents, which are linked to the PDO (see annex 6). They are drawn from the 16 3-year (2008-2010)
expected outcomes in the revised NREG Performance Assessment Framework (PAF). The DPO-1 program
document did not identify key outcome indicators, but did identify 3-year outcomes for the 8 (of an original
24) program / policy objectives corresponding to the DPO triggers. The outcome indicators and baselines in
the DPO-1 document were generally qualitative, and substantially revised during the preparation of DPO-2.

1.3. Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

12. The same statement of objectives was included in all three program documents, although it was first
explicitly labeled as the Program Development Objective and linked to a set of Key Outcome Indicators in
the DPO-2 program document.

1.4 Original Policy Areas Supported by the Program (as approved):

13. The NREG DPOs supported reforms in three natural resource sectors – forestry and wildlife,
mining, and environmental protection – under the institutional mandate of three semi-autonomous
agencies, the Forestry Commission (FC), the Minerals Commission (MC), and the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA), respectively. The selection of policy areas was based on the findings of a number
of analytical studies carried out prior to the NREG preparation5 as well as policy interventions and reforms
implemented by the Government under the GPRS I.

14. The forestry and wildlife sector was identified as an important pillar of economic growth. The formal
sector employed about 120,000 Ghanaians, and is dominated by sawmills that focus on international
markets. Processed wood products accounted for only 11 percent of exports, and Government did not
capture high levels of timber values. The residual forest rent not collected by government was estimated to
be typically US$10 to US$45 million per year. Of the total industry turnover of US$500 million in 2004,
GoG captured only US$22 million. The potential of the timber industry had not been realized as market
practices were inefficient in their utilization of wood extracted, employed outdated technology and
considerably exceeded the annual allowable cut required to sustain the productive base of the industry.

Domestic demand for timber was estimated to be roughly equal to that of the export market yet there was
insufficient supply from legal sources to meet this demand. The illegal chainsaw industry provided US$ 1.3
million in income for an estimated 50,000 people in 2003, yet was un-regulated, unsustainably managed,
and wasteful due to processing of logs by chainsaw as opposed to sawmills.

15. Data across 46 forest reserves, comparing inventories in the 1950‟s, 1970‟s and 1990s showed that
forest stocks were being degraded, with a loss of 0.13m2/ha/yr in average basal area of stems. Degradation
of forest reserves accelerated dramatically in the last decade from over-logging, encroachment, illegal
logging, and bushfires. Off-reserve, losses arose from the combined expansion of farming (especially
cocoa) and demand for timber for domestic (informal) markets. The CEA estimated that timber depletion
results in an annual cost of about 3.5 percent of Ghana‟s GDP. A key challenge for the FC was insufficient
budget that hindered performance of its management, regulatory and enforcement mandates. Furthermore,
opportunities existed for attracting investment in ecotourism and plantation development, and for the
promotion of value-added processing, but had not received sufficient attention.

16. In order to ensure good governance in the forestry sector, the Government prioritized its actions under
four strategic policy areas: (i) strengthening institutional capacity of the sector to ensure effective policy
implementation and law enforcement and securing predictable and sustainable financing of the forestry
sector, (ii) promoting collaborative resource management, promoting forest and wildlife investments, (iii)
increasing supply of legal timber on the domestic market and (iv) securing the natural ecosystem and
strengthening monitoring and evaluation and information communication technology.

17. At preparation, revenues from Ghana‟s mining sector represented about 5 percent of GDP and 12
percent of Government‟s revenues and the mining industry accounted for 37 percent of Ghana‟s total
exports. Ghana has one of the worlds‟ largest gold ore reserves, ranking around tenth worldwide in gold
production and second in Africa. Ghana is also a significant producer of manganese ore, and diamonds.
Metal prices have risen greatly in recent years, and gold prices more than doubled. Nonetheless, with the
use of older calculation procedures along a sliding scale and lack of capacity for collection, it was widely
suspected that GoG was not benefitting from mining revenues as fully as it should have been, given the
increase in resource prices. Ghana‟s EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) reports also
illustrated inadequate scrutiny of mining sector revenues, estimating that this could cost Ghana a significant
amount in terms of foregone revenue.

18. At the time of the program, seven large and one medium-scale gold mining company formally
employed about 15,000 people, with an additional 5,000 working on other minerals. A further 500,000
people are estimated to work in artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM), although the actual figure is not
reliably known. Mining in Ghana has been characterized by divergent interests, cultures and institutions,
lack of clarity over legal compensation and the distribution of benefits, conflict and a lack of trust between
communities, industry and Government, as well as tensions between local communities and migrants. With
increasing gold price and government strategy to attract more foreign investment, disputes have been on the
rise. Moreover, large-scale mining operations often cause involuntary resettlement, resulting in loss of land,
livelihoods and resources for local communities. Another area of concern has been the environmental
damage resulting from mining activities, especially unregulated ASM. Conscious of these challenges, GoG
and its development partners (DPs) identified establishment of a modern policy and regulatory framework,
the improvement of mining sector revenue collection, management, and transparency and the tackling of
social issues in mining communities as critical areas for reform under NREG.

19. With respect to environmental protection, health costs related to water supply, sanitation and indoor
air pollution were identified as one of the key sources of the high cost of environmental degradation in
Ghana. EIA systems are relatively well-established in Ghana, and the country has been a regional pioneer in
the application of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). However, several challenges remained for


                                                       4
effective regulatory mechanisms, especially enforcement of compliance. There was a need to improve
coverage and effectiveness of the current EIA systems, including decentralizing the EIA review process to
avoid bottlenecks in Accra, and developing sectoral guidelines. Ghana also needed to consolidate its
leadership in SEA through mainstreaming application to sectoral policies and district plans. Monitoring and
enforcement of the recommendations of various environmental assessment tools has also been weak partly
due to resource constraints for the EPA. To enhance environmental governance, there was also a need to
establish mechanism and a platform for more comprehensive dialogue and partnership between government
agencies and sector stakeholders. In the context of an assessment of Ghana‟s vulnerability to the impacts of
climate change under the Initial National Communication to the UNFCCC, there was also increasing
appreciation of the potential vulnerability of Ghana‟s coastal zone, agriculture (including fisheries, cocoa,
cereals, and root crops production), and water resource sectors, as well as human health, poverty, and
women‟s livelihoods, to climate change and variability.

20. To improve the effectiveness of environmental management, NREG identified as key areas of reform:
(i) carrying out SEAs to inform decision-making and mainstream environment in sector planning; (ii)
improving cross-sectoral environmental management, including development and implementation of an
inter-sectoral climate change strategy; (iii) strengthening of the EIA process and compliance
bydecentralizing environment management, reinforcing monitoring and effective dissemination; and (iv)
regularizing funding for EPA and ensuring better civil society participation.

21. Two other natural resource sectors were considered for inclusion in NREG, but not carried
forward as core pillars of the program. Discussions were held with the Fisheries Department, but given
its institutional home within the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, it was considered more appropriate to
support fisheries policy reform through the Bank‟s Agricultural Development DPO series. Anticipation of
rapid development of the oil and gas sector in Ghana was growing at around the time that the NREG
Program was being developed, and consideration was given to how this sector might be supported in
parallel to mining and forestry. NREG partners were concerned, however, that the expected rapid growth
of the oil and gas sector might overwhelm the already broad NREG agenda, and, therefore, it was decided
not to address it directly under the present program.

1.5       Revised Policy Areas (if applicable):

22. No changes were made to the general policy areas during the course of the three DPOs, although
the Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) was streamlined during the preparation of DPO-2
with a reduction in the policy objectives (from 24 to 16) and targets (from more than 60 to around 40),
together with considerable efforts to tighten the indicators to make them more precise and measurable.
Support for sustainable management of the oil sector through a SEA was also included. In the context of
the third DPO, the prior action on submission of a climate change adaptation strategy to cabinet was
dropped as it was superseded by the Government‟s new policy to develop a comprehensive (i.e. adaptation
and mitigation) National Climate Change Framework. In general terms, however, attention to climate
change issues has intensified during and with support of NREG, through publication of the Economics of
Adaptation to Climate Change, and emergence of new opportunities for forest carbon financing.

1.6       Other significant changes:

23. Changes since preparation of DPO-1:

         IDA financing. During the identification and preparation of the NREG program the indicative IDA
          allocation for the Bank‟s support to the program, rose from US$3 million for the first year, to
          US$10 million, and eventually to US$20 million, when the potential for inclusion of considerable
          activities in the oil and gas sector appeared high. Following resistance from other development


                                                      5
         partners (DPs) to inclusion of major oil and gas activities, however, it was decided that the IDA
         allocation for the subsequent two years would remain at $10m per year. Despite these amounts
         being discussed and agreed with the Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning (MoFEP), it created
         an impression amongst the NREG ministries, departments and agencies (MDAs) that funding had
         been reduced relative to expectations. Whilst this was unlikely to have had much material effect on
         the implementation of the NREG program, given that absorption by the three core agencies has
         lagged behind the available funding, the perceived cut did create some tension, adding to existing
         sensitivities in the forestry sector over the Bank‟s earlier decision to discontinue support to NRMP.

        Institutional setting. When NREG was first under preparation, EPA was under the Ministry of
         Local Government, Rural Development and Environment (MLGRDE). Prior to Appraisal of DPO-
         1, however, it became effectively independent, although formally still under the oversight of the
         Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development. Then in 2009, it was included within the
         reformed Ministry of Environment Science and Technology (MEST). As a result, the routing of
         funds to the EPA for NREG activities has changed a number of times, as has the autonomy with
         which it could act. This has at times led to some delays in the transfer of funds to the EPA as well
         as in the implementation of its activities.

        Change of government. National elections were held in autumn 2008, shortly after DPO-1 became
         effective, and a new government was installed in early 2009. As with the institutional changes
         above, this did not lead to any appreciable change in the policy content of the program, but it did
         delay certain activities, particularly policy dialogue and coordination with senior levels of
         government.

2.       Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

         2.1      Program Performance:

24. The Performance Assessment Framework (PAF) for the NREG Program details annual targets
grouped under policy objectives. Six triggers were drawn from the targets for each operation6. Outcome
indicators were also specified for each policy objective at 5 years (end of the GoG NREG Program) and,
during development of DPO-2, also at 3 years (end of the Bank‟s DPO series). Annex 7 summarizes the
PAF for the 3 years of the Bank DPO series, based on the streamlined version created for DPO-2, but
including relevant parts of the DPO-1 matrix.

25. All triggers for all three DPOs were met, with the exception of the dropped DPO-3 trigger on
submission of a climate change adaptation strategy which was waived (see section 1.5 above).
However, there is a performance gap between the achievement of the triggers and achievement
against the PDO indicators, largely due to a disconnect between the triggers (which received
particular attention during the Program) and the PDO indicators (which did not). The PDO indicators
were not referenced in the legal documents, and after their initial formulation were not given much
emphasis, nor were they revised during preparation of DPO-3, despite changes to related PAF targets. The
following tables summarize achievements within each sector in relation to both the triggers and
corresponding PDO indicators, to give a clearer picture of achievement within the focal areas of the
Program than is evident from review of the PDO indicators alone. The disconnect with the triggers is
evident in the occurrence of PDO indicator targets which:


6
  Annex 6 lists all the triggers according to the exact language in the legal agreements. Triggers were used as a basis
for World Bank approval of each operation. Other DPs disbursed against a more holistic assessment of progress
against PAF targets.


                                                            6
          are not directly related to any PAF targets – e.g. survey to track perception of use of mining
           revenues at local levels, and updated legislative instrument on SEA.
          are directly related to PAF targets, but not to the triggers – e.g. increase in the legal wood supply to
           domestic markets, increase in plantation forest area, and establishment of SSM cooperatives.
          were not updated after DPO-2, and are therefore out of sync with revised DPO-3 action targets,
           e.g.:
           - increase in legal timber supply, although the end-of-DPO-3 target was only for a baseline to be
                evaluated.
           - FLEGT license to be issued, although the DPO-3 target was only for completion of the wood
                tracking pilot.
           - design and implementation of a conflict tracking tool, although the DPO-3 target was only to
                initiate development of an annual tracking mechanism.
           - establishment of 3 SSM cooperatives, although the DPO-3 target was only to conduct
                exploration in new areas after the initial areas identified appeared unsuitable.
           - long-term climate investment plan, although the DPO-3 target was only for a consolidated
                National Framework for Climate Change, which did not include the identification of specific
                investments.

                    Implementation of FLEGT systems in the formal forestry sector has progressed well through a
                    consultative process. The Voluntary Partnership Agreement (VPA) was signed with the EU,

                    been complex and slower than anticipated, and therefore issuance of the first license is somewhat
                    delayed. In the meantime, faced with a largely uncontrolled informal industry, the stocks of quality
                    timber available for the formal, export sector appear to be rapidly dwindling.
                    Ghanaian sawmills are required to provide 20% of output to the domestic market. In reality the
                    figure is probably closer to around 5%, as domestic buyers are unwilling to pay export prices. A
                    proposal to increase domestic supply by allowing chainsaw operators to retrieve stumps and residues
                    from licensed timber coupes is delayed by questions over legal rights. Other proposals, to (i) better
                    enforce the requirement on sawmills to supply the domestic market or (ii) regularize informal
                    chainsaw operators more generally, have yet to be developed into detailed policies.

                    Timber export levy was decreased from 3% to 1.5% following complaints by the timber
                     companies that this is no longer ear-marked for re-investment in the industry.
                    Conversion of timber concessions to Timber Utilization Contracts is subject to legal review.
                    Linking stumpage fees to exchange rates is under consideration, but resisted by the industry.
                    Proposals to establish a payment for environmental services (PES) system to fund forest areas are
                     at an exploratory stage.
                  Timber revenues did initially increase, but then declined in 2009 and 2010. Changes are likely due
                  mainly to cutting cycles and the general decline in the availability of valuable timber – the available
                  data do not reveal the impact of improved collection performance.
                  On revenue transparency, district revenues have been published, although dissemination at the local
                  level remains rudimentary. Ghana plans to make forestry EITI-compliant, and combining with
                  mining and oil sectors offers potentials for strengthening dissemination of sub-national revenue that
                  Ghana is attempting to pioneer through its EITI program.
                  NREG targets on the signing of leases and benefit-sharing agreements contributed to expansion of
                  plantations beyond the 15% target, but FC struggled to attract as much private sector investment as
                  desired, and most of the increase was through direct government action.

                 and NDPC have worked to introduce the use of basic SEA tools into routine local government

Independent Advisory and Monitoring Team‟s (IMAT) assessment8 for the same year pointed out a number
of weaknesses and deviations from the original means of verification (MoVs)9, suggesting that the later
joint assessment benefited from more flexibility in the interpretation of MoVs as well as the additional time
to complete delivery. Implementation against NREG work plans prepared by the MDAs also encountered
delays, partly due to delays in the transfer of funds10, but mainly to limits on absorptive capacity imposed
by staffing constraints and procurement processes. Budget performance of NREG MDAs has been steadily
improving during the course of the program, but up to September 2010, MoFEP had only transferred a total
amount of GhC 68.7 million, out of an available GhC 97 million11. These constraints on implementation
suggest that expectations on completion of all annual PAF targets to schedule were overly ambitious.

         2.2       Major Factors Affecting Implementation:

Government's commitment

27. Ownership of the NREG Program and associated matrix by the three natural resource agencies,
and engagement by Ministry of Finance & Economic Planning (MoFEP) have been strong, and is
cited as a step-change from the earlier experience in the NRM sectors under a traditional project
modality. MDAs uniformly feel empowered by and enthusiastic about the NREG process than previous
investment projects (see annex 3). The Technical Coordination Committee (TCC), led by MoFEP and
including representatives from participating MDAs and the National Development Planning Commission
(NDPC), has generally provided an effective platform for inter-agency dialogue and coordination, including
annual performance reviews and updates to the PAF. Leadership by MoFEP has been key13, and the recent
appointment of a Natural Resources Director (a former Technical Director for forestry in the Ministry of
Land & Natural Resources) is evidence of the strong engagement by the Ministry.

  For mining and environment only; forestry was not included due to an road accident that befell the IMAT‟s forestry
specialist.
9
  E.g. the establishment of an inter-ministerial environment and natural resources forum was supposed to be evidenced
by the minutes of the first meeting, but a draft TOR for establishment of the Environment and Natural Resources
Advisory Committee (ENRAC) was instead provided as ENRAC didn‟t meet until later 2010.
10
   E.g. out of the GhC 8.4 million transferred to the EPA by Feb 2010, the agency received the bulk (60 percent) only
within preceding three months. (IMAT 2010)

the assessment.

agencies in a constructive manner, leading to efficiency gains within the sector through cross-agency learning.? (MTR,

28. Nevertheless, the Program would have benefited from supplementary capacity to meet
coordination, M&E and reporting requirements, and from more engagement from senior decision-
makers around contentious issues, such as revisions to the forestry fiscal regime. NREG coordinators
in all the key MDAs, including the MoFEP NREG Program Coordinator14, have numerous other duties,
which significantly constrained program management capacity (for e.g., close oversight of PHRD and other
consultancies, development of sector strategies, monitoring and reporting). Engagement by senior policy-
makers also lagged behind engagement at the technical level, in part due to disruptions from the change of
government during the first year of the Program and the protracted institutional transition of the EPA to the
newly re-formed Ministry of Environment, Science & Technology (MEST). The Policy Committee
envisaged in the original NREG design was replaced by an Environment and Natural Resources Advisory
Council (ENRAC) with a long-term mandate, but it was not convened until late 2010, with the first
substantive meeting on policy issues occurring in February 2011. Select members of parliament have
attended some NREG meetings, but more could have been done to educate legislators on the Program and
issues.

Stakeholder involvement

29. NREG involved strong commitment to stakeholder inclusion, notably through the organization of
annual Sector Summits, but the approach to civil society inclusion could be further elaborated and
institutionalized. Many government activities related to civil society engagement and transparency have
been implemented, including a pioneering EITI program, a public environmental rating and disclosure
process, and consultation platforms at national and local level (see annex 9 for more details), but the overall
approach could have been more systematic. Although the span of activities has been wider, much of the
discussion on civil society within NREG has focused on how to coordinate input from civil society
organizations (CSOs) to workshops and dialogue. A comprehensive strategy would have given more
recognition to other aspects, such as community co-management, adoption of transparency standards,
participatory monitoring, etc. Engagement could also be strengthened at the local level. For instance, data
on district-level revenues from mining and forestry have been published but effective dissemination to
impacted communities is limited, and District and Regional Forest Forums need more support. Civil society
is increasingly vibrant and recognized as a potentially important development resource in Ghana, but
attitudes within Government still vary between individuals and agencies who appreciate the value-added of
civil society engagement15, and others which view it primarily as an issue of compliance with minimum
consultation requirements.

30. Direct support to CSOs on environment and natural resource issues was successfully piloted. In
addition to government activities, the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands (EKN) established direct
capacity-building support to CSOs, including parallel civil society reviews of the NREG Program, through
the Kasa (“speak out? in Twi) mechanism16. The multi-donor civil society facility originally envisaged in
the DPO-1 Program Document did not materialize, but Kasa commenced in the 2nd year of NREG and was
assessed to have „done remarkably well for a pilot with effectively 18 months of implementation‟, although
with some more attention needed to strategic direction and gender focus17. It promoted increased civil
society engagement in NRE issues, including through establishment of CSO platforms and working

   Notably, he is also head of the EITI Secretariat.
15
   E.g., the EPA perceives the strength of its mandate to be linked to its ability to mobilize public understanding and
concern around environmental issues, and is therefore enthusiastic on civil society engagement.
16
   Kasa‟s activities focused on (i) supporting capacity enhancement activities of civil society groups, (ii) providing
grants to civil society, research and media organizations to conduct advocacy, (iii) facilitating platforms for
information sharing with Government and DPs and (iv) documenting lessons learned to inform a longer-term civil
society advocacy mechanism for equitable natural resource and environmental governance in Ghana.

relationships with the media. CARE and DANIDA have stepped in to continue support to Kasa beyond the
initial pilot phase, but due to a change in EKN funding priorities, longer term support remains in doubt.

31. Many Ghanaian NGOs have a healthy skepticism towards government. Building the robust
relationships and understanding that will facilitate constructive dialogue is a gradual process. Overall,
NREG has seen markedly increased dialogue between government NRM agencies and civil society, but not
all CSOs are familiar with NREG, still fewer have been actively involved in government-led meetings, and
trust remains weak in some quarters. Consultations have led to increased expectations and to some
frustrations from CSOs that their feedback was not subsequently incorporated into policy18. According to
the World Bank Civil Society Monitoring program that reviewed NREG in 201019, CSOs suggested a
number of platforms for further engagement with civil society, including Publish What You Pay, a CSOs-
led transparency and accountability network, the new Ghana Oil Platform bringing together CSOs to
interface with government on petroleum matters, and the National Coalition on Mining (NCOM). NREG
has also illuminated complexities of engaging with traditional authorities. They are important stakeholders
and community representatives in their own right, and are routinely included in consultation structures, but
they have also resisted attempts to increase transparency of the use of natural resource revenues that flow to
them. The MTR also pointed out that structured involvement of the private sector in policy discussions has
been limited.

Soundness of the background analysis

32. NREG design was founded on a considerable analytical base, which identified areas of concern,
but left room for more precise policy analysis as part of the program. In particular, the Country
Environmental Analysis (CEA; World Bank, DFID, RNE, AFD 2007) evaluated the economic costs of
environmental degradation in Ghana, building on the Ghana Natural Resources Management and Growth
Sustainability Economic and Sector Work (World Bank, DFID, 2006), and the Ghana Environment Sector
Study (GESS, EKN 2006), which reviewed institutional capacity for environmental management20. The
CEA identified environmental governance as key for sustainable management of the country‟s natural
resources and this became a catalyst for the creation of the NREG budget support program. It also laid out a
broad agenda of reform, that was highly influential in the development of the PAF, e.g. making
recommendations to review fiscal regimes in forestry and mining, pay more attention to local consultation
and social safeguards in forestry and mining, introduce more transparency and competition in bidding for
timber concessions, introduce legal timber verification systems, encourage private sector involvement in
forest plantation, promote CSR by mining companies, establish programs for management of ASM, and
increase capacity for environmental management within the mining sector.

33. During NREG preparation, institutional and contextual analyses were undertaken through a
recipient-executed PHRD grant, including a Stakeholder and Risk Analysis, a Public Revenue Analysis, a
review of budget, expenditure & financial management in the NRE sectors, and a study of options to
empower civil society. The PHRD studies were useful, but could have gone into more depth and detail.
Delivery was delayed, with the result that outputs were not timely for program preparation and over 40
percent of the funds21 were returned, as the grant had to be closed once NREG became Effective.

18
   Partly this is a result of naivety amongst young CSOs, who sometimes assume that having a voice should
automatically equate to policy influence, rather than appreciating that their influence ultimately relies on the quality of
what they bring to the debate in terms of novel analysis or effective representation of broader constituencies.

   The choice of instrument and financial aspects were also informed by the “Budget Support, Aid instrument and

and the draft (2009) Public Expenditure Financial Accountability report .

34. The Program design also drew on lessons from previous Bank interventions in the NRE sectors in
Ghana, the ongoing Multi-Donor Budget Support program, a Bank environment DPO in Mexico and
an environment sector budget support program in Senegal supported by EKN. Similar Bank
environmental DPOs in Gabon and Cameroon were not cited amongst the lessons learnt, presumably
because they were considered too young during NREG preparation. Lessons focused on the need for
ownership, establishing an effective monitoring and evaluation system with sound baseline data and the
importance of public participation.

Choice of instrument

35. At the time of preparation, there was general consensus amongst DPs and GoG to make increased
use of budget support. Following earlier donor-supported interventions for the environment and in the
natural resources (particularly forestry) sectors, there was a desire to move away from isolated investments
to a sector-based approach that could tackle systemic governance issues and elevate the level of the
dialogue. A conventional, sector-wide approach was discussed, but around the time of preparation, sector
budget support (SBS) was becoming increasingly popular with a number of donors, and was seen by both
GoG and DPs as a more mature approach that would provide for enhanced ownership against a relatively
strong record of governance and development performance in Ghana. Development policy lending provided
an instrument by which the Bank could contribute to the NREG Program. In line with the donor
harmonization agenda22 and Ghana‟s good track record of implementing the EGPRC as part of a Multi-
Donor Budget Support program, close to 59 percent of lending under the current CAS is currently via
DPOs. Flexible sector-based financing is considered to have been instrumental in strengthening sector
ownership and engaging MoFEP and NDPC in the substance of the Program, ultimately leading to much
stronger support for reform.

36. Nevertheless, the transition from traditional investment lending, and the combination of SBS
(emphasizing predictable support to implementation of broad programs of activities through
strengthened sector systems) and development policy lending (focused specifically on policy reform)
within a single instrument, engendered a steep learning process and a degree of compromise. The
NREG PAF included a range of activities, which did not always have a very strong policy focus, and many
staff working on NREG have a tendency to focus on technical activities23. At a practical level, many
activities could have been achieved through a technical assistance (TA) investment operation, such as the
development of social responsibility guidelines and monitoring in the mining sector, the preparation of
climate change strategies, or the strengthening of environmental assessment systems. Some activities, such
as expansion of forest plantations, were GoG sector priorities, but were not fully reflected in NREG as they
were more investment than policy focused. The PAF contained targets for facilitation of private sector
investments in forest plantations, but two thirds of the recent growth in plantations has still come from
direct government investment. The transition to programmatic support also requires effective sector
systems, which were not well developed at the start of NREG. Progress has been made on sector systems
through the Program, but the work is ongoing. This is discussed in more detail in section 3.4b.

37. The Bank was constrained in its choices during preparation by the availability of instruments and
an initially modest financial contribution. The Bank does not have an instrument specifically designed to
work in an SBS modality (although the Program-for-Results instrument is currently in development). A
DPO could have been designed to combine with or to complement the sector support instrument being
supported by other DPs, but the initial commitment from the Bank was to provide only US$3 million

   The 2007 Ghana Joint Assistance Strategy, signed by 16 partners, included a specific commitment by DPs to
increase the amount of aid being channeled through budget support.

   Evidenced by the assertion during PAF formulation that targets on policy adoption are inappropriate as they can
only be delivered by senior decision-makers.

towards an expected first phase financing pool of US$15 million. The Bank‟s relatively minor financial
contribution was therefore intended to leverage the contributions of the other DPs, and an explicit decision
was taken during preparation not to formulate a separate policy matrix for the Bank‟s operation. The
eventual US$20 million IDA credit for the first operation was not made available until late in preparation.

38. The choice of instrument has allowed GoG to feel that it is being treated as a mature partner with
full ownership of the program, but issues of capacity and the policy content of the matrix suggest a
weakness to using a DPO alone to provide predictable funding to a multi-faceted sector program. In
hindsight, a clearer distinction between the Bank‟s DPO series and other donors‟ SBS would have helped to
sharpen the focus on key policy results.

Complexity

39. NREG is institutionally complex. The Program encompasses forestry, mining and environment,
stretching across two Ministries and three semi-autonomous government agencies, in addition to the
Ministry of Finance. The program is supported by 5 DPs, 4 of whom were active in the technical dialogue.
The scope of the dialogue leading up to NREG was originally focused on governance of natural resource
rents from forestry, mining and fisheries, but environmental management and climate change were added as
cross-cutting issues affecting the natural resource sectors. Fisheries was eventually dropped from the NREG
program as the Department of Fisheries is housed within the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, which
receives policy lending through the World Bank‟s Agricultural Development DPO series. Discussions
around the mooted inclusion the oil and gas sector are summarized in section 1.6 above.

40. This complexity brought benefits, but also came with costs. The inclusion of three NRM sectors is
felt by both GoG and DPs to have been beneficial in terms of sharing lessons on parallel activities such as
revenue management and participation of local communities, and raising the profile of cross-cutting themes,
such as environmental management and climate change. The harmonization of the support of 5 DPs around
a single program was highly appreciated by GoG, although adding to the burden of coordination, reporting
and dialogue for the MDAs. From a DP perspective, transaction costs have been higher due to the need for
greater donor coordination. An informal understanding between the DPs on division of labor in supervision
support did not function as well as intended. Overlaps in the technical dialogue remained because individual
DPs were still accountable for results across all sectors, whilst some specific gaps occurred, such as
adoption of clear responsibility for support to a second-phase PSIA study. Conversely, the need to present a
coordinated DP position limited agility at times, particularly with respect to the oil and gas sector, where the
Bank‟s interest in using NREG to respond to emerging national priorities was greater than that of other
development partners. Even within the Bank team, supervision involved both the African Environment and
Natural Resources and the Gas, Oil and Mining sector units, and staff from the latter at times felt that they
lacked the freedom and resources to engage to the extent for which separate mining operation would have
provided.

41. Multi-sector and multi-donor programs do work, but require a lot of effort, efficient working
relationships take time to crystallize, and some degree of complementarity is usually required. DPOs
routinely work across several sectors. The ICR for PRSCs 1-3 in Ghana, which provided Bank support to
the Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS) program, discusses similar themes of transaction costs and
compromise, and indicates the need for both high investment of staff resources and time for effective
working relationships to evolve. Typically however, PRSCs are able to draw on a wealth of other sector-
specific operations to support technical dialogue, and do not go into the same level of detail and breadth on
sector-specific planning and systems as NREG attempted to do under its SBS approach. This again supports
the argument for a greater differentiation of donor support and instruments than occurred under NREG.

Technical assistance & related operations

42. The NREG Program involved considerable TA, but the impact has been mixed, and overall, the
approach has not been as systematic as was originally envisaged. Development of a complementary TA
facility based on a comprehensive needs assessment was discussed during preparation and referenced in the
DPO-1 program document24, but was not hard-wired into the design – i.e. no binding commitments and
funding sources were established. Many TA activities have taken place, but the systematic approach
envisaged at design did not materialize, and the results have been mixed. Some TA has been provided
directly by DPs in addition to the budget support, and in other cases, DPs took a very active role in advising
GoG on the identification of appropriate expertise, for example:
     Robust support on public financial management (PFM) has been provided through periodic visits of
         a PFM advisor, funded by EKN and much appreciated by MDAs.
     Considerable analytical work has been carried out as part of a dialogue on Climate Change
         supported by NREG. Individual studies were largely implemented by separate DPs25, rather than
         through NREG or the National Climate Change Committee, leading to some complaints that
         pooling funds would have allowed for a more comprehensive approach.
     An Independent Monitoring and Advisory Team (IMAT), financed by the EU, was mobilized to
         backstop monitoring against the 2009 PAF, but was not fully welcomed by the MDAs and has not
         been institutionalized (see section 2.3).
     High-quality work on modeling mining revenues was carried out with the assistance of a leading
         international expert, identified with assistance of the Bank. This helped to ease concerns over laxity
         in the mining fiscal regime.
These instances have sometimes (but not always) been more effective than where TA inputs have been
managed by GoG more independently and typically limited to the use of national consultants, for example:
     Useful social analysis around conflict and CSR has been conducted in the mining sector, leading to
         the production of sound voluntary guidelines.
     A survey was conducted of the domestic timber market, but the analysis of options for increasing
         the legal supply of wood for internal consumption was cursory, and led to little implementation
         since.
     SEAs have been produced for key sectors, although translating them into tangible action has been
         more challenging.
     A local TA firm contacted by MoFEP to support the development of sector M&E systems has
         added only modest value to date.

43. The NREG DPO series has been the Bank’s central instrument for engaging in the forestry,
mining and environmental protection sectors over the last three years, although a number of other
activities have made some contributions. The Bank has supported some TA activities related to NREG
through trust funds, notably the EITI Trust Fund and work on economics of adaptation to climate change
using a number of funds. Linkage to other lending operations has been limited. Sustainable land
management, fisheries and land administration investment projects have all been worked on natural
resource issues outside the scope of those covered by NREG. An oil and gas TA project was prepared in
parallel to NREG implementation. It supported some SEA and capacity-building activities within the EPA,
and there is growing interest in improving the sharing of lessons with the NREG sectors on e.g., revenue
management and civil society engagement issues. Some targets developed under NREG, notably the
establishment of the ENRAC, were linked to Multi-Donor Budget Support program to provide additional

   DPO-1 claimed that “The DPO series will have a signaling effect in helping Ghana mobilize additional resources,
which are critical to the successful implementation o f the NREG program. This includes . . . capacity building and
technical assistance?, and discussed a technical assistance grant to accompany DPO-2.
25
   E.g., the World Bank supported the Economics of Adaptation to Climate Change country case study for Ghana, and
DFID has produced a series of policy briefs.

incentives for timely completion. Although the process began too late to inform the existing NREG PAF,
the strongest overlap in subject area has been with the design of support to Ghana from the Forest Carbon
Partnership Facility and the Forest Investment Program. These funds will support planning, capacity and
investments to enhance carbon stocks in Ghana‟s forests, are already driving much of the technical dialogue
on the forestry sector, and should complement future policy support through any continuation of NREG.

Relevance of the risks identified at appraisal and effectiveness of mitigation measures

44. Key risks identified during preparation (see annex 10) were appropriate, but risks associated with
weak implementation capacity were overlooked (other than for PFM). Envisaged political, public
financial management (PFM) and social risks materialized to some extent. The change of government
following the elections in late 2008 and the subsequent reformation of MEST slowed down some aspects of
implementation. Weak PFM systems were in part responsible for delays in release of funds to MDAs and
their effective absorption, and reforms aimed at increasing revenue collection from the commercial forestry
sector have in some cases been resisted by the timber industry in Ghana. None of these issues has been
overwhelming, however, and in the case of the PFM, TA has been effective in identifying remedial actions
and gradually strengthening performance. In hindsight, more attention could have been given to risks to
broader implementation performance, including capacity constraints on program execution, defining and
monitoring against clear policy targets, and addressing emergent sector issues.

        2.3     Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization:

M&E design

45. The M&E framework for NREG was weak. At the heart of the problem was an overly extensive
Program Assessment Framework (PAF) that substituted for under-developed sector planning
systems and did not provide sufficient focus on key results. The PAF included a set of policy objectives,
targets, outcome indicators and means of verification that were jointly identified and revised with the
Government on an annual basis. Though it was agreed that the PAF should be limited in size and comprise
only the most crucial objectives and targets of the three sectors, the DPO-1 matrix ended up including 24
program / policy objectives, and more than 60 targets for each of the first 3 years. From the outset, the PAF
was used not only to capture key policy reforms and outcomes, but a much wider set of activities and
intermediate steps. MDAs familiar with investment projects used the PAF to plan NREG-related activities
and justify their claim on resources to MoFEP. Many PAF targets were therefore output-oriented, which led
to issues of subjectivity in the subsequent performance assessments – i.e. outputs were produced, but there
were sometimes disagreements between GoG and DPs over the acceptable level of quality (see annex 3).

46. Commitment to GoG ownership hindered rationalization of the PAF. As mentioned above, the
decision was taken during preparation avoid using a separate policy matrix for the DPO, but instead to work
with the PAF resulting from broader SBS goals and a highly GoG-led process. During preparation of DPO-
2, an M&E specialist from the Bank was mobilized to support streamlining the PAF, resulting in a modest
decrease in the number of policy objectives to 16 and annual targets to 35. Three and 5-year outcome
indicators were also included for each of the 16 policy objectives. Despite agreement of the TCC on the
need to streamline, the push to achieve this within a short-term Bank mission jarred with the established
GoG-led approaches and the process left some disgruntlement on the side of the MDAs.

47. World Bank disbursement triggers did attract greater focus, but the PDO indicators linked to
them were flawed. Selection of 6 annual triggers did provide more focus, as evidenced by the higher
performance against triggers in comparison to other annual PAF targets. Three-year outcomes linked to the
6 triggers were established during preparation of DPO-2 as Key Outcome (effectively PDO) Indicators for
the DPO series. Of the 12 indicators identified, however, 5 are actually outputs (such as the design of


                                                     16
survey tools, application of fiscal models or preparation of an investment plan), mostly copied directly from
annual targets, rather than representing downstream outcomes. Those that are genuinely outcome-oriented,
typically did not have established baselines even by DPO-2, and some presented attribution issues, such as
the target to increase timber revenues by 15 percent. Each of the 3-year outcomes from which the PDO
indicators were drawn was also linked to a number of PAF targets, which explains some of the disconnects
identified in section 2.1 between the achievement of triggers and PDO indicators.

M&E implementation

48. The need to develop sector M&E systems has been accepted, but implementation progress has
been slow. At least since 2009, and with the support of a new country-based Bank M&E specialist,
development of comprehensive M&E systems for each of the NREG agencies has been on the agenda.
Recognition by the MDAs of the need for comprehensive sector M&E systems is in itself a significant
achievement that is unlikely to have been pursued under earlier project-based lending. Credible efforts have
already been made in this direction, including the establishment of Planning, Monitoring & Evaluation
Units, and the FC commissioned its own study on M&E design. Unfortunately the MDAs were let down by
weak performance of a consultancy intended to support all three. After agreement on the TOR and some
delays, a local team was engaged by MoFEP during the first half of 2011, but their value-added has been
limited as they have focused on the design of a needlessly elaborate information system, rather than
establishing appropriate indicators and monitoring protocols for each of the agencies.

49. An attempt to establish an Independent Monitoring and Advisory Team (IMAT) to reduce the
burden and increase transparency of the PAF assessment was not successfully adopted. To
systematize the PAF assessment, it was originally proposed that the government would establish, at first for
the NREG triggers and ultimately for all targets, a methodological data sheet (clarifying responsibilities,
data collection methods, means of verifications, etc.), but this was not carried through26. For the 2009 PAF
assessment, a small group of international and national consultants was recruited as the IMAT to carry out
an independent assessment. The intention was to reduce the transaction burden of the annual PAF
assessments on MDAs, MoFEP and DPs, whilst providing a more objective and transparent process, and
M&E TA support to the MDAs more generally. Nevertheless, the MDAs received it unenthusiastically as
more of a policing than a support function, due to an accident to one of the IMAT members the forestry
sector was not covered, and a joint GoG-DP performance assessment was still required. The exercise was
not repeated for the 2010 assessment.

50. The 3-year outcome indicators, including the DPO series PDO indicators, have not received
appropriate attention. With GoG focused on a 5-year NREG lifespan, the 3-year outcome targets were
inserted into the PAF essentially in relation to the Bank‟s financing schedule, but have not received
effective follow-up since 2008. There was no systematic attempt to report against the indicators at the end
of DPO-3, nor were they updated during DPO-3 preparation, despite the fact that many of the
corresponding PAF targets had changed. As a result, several of the indicators were no longer realistic in
comparison to the PAF targets expected by the end of DPO-3. Resulting disconnects between the PDO
indicators and the DPO series triggers were detailed under section 2.1.

M&E utilization

51. Use of M&E data has been limited by its availability. Information on the attainment of triggers and
broader PAF targets has been used as a basis for disbursement by the Bank and other DPs, respectively.
Assessing the contribution that PAF target have made to overall progress within the NREG sectors is harder
due to weaknesses in the outcome indicators and sector M&E systems. Weak sector M&E also made it

difficult to monitor implementation in a more detailed or real-time manner. For example, information on
EIA processing performance by the EPA was available in 2011 to verify if the 2010 target and outcome
indicator was met, but was not available in time to adjust performance ahead of the milestone.

        2.4     Expected Next Phase/Follow-up Operation (if any):

52. GoG’s 5-year NREG Program was predicated on the need for predictable, and coordinated
medium-term donor support. NREG DPs are mostly continuing support, but with some degree of re-
configuration. EKN, EU and AFD have undertaken to support the Program for the full 5 years (up to
2012), whereas the World Bank (and DFID) committed to provide support for the first three years and then
assess progress, with a view to determining the best course for further support. The indication in the NREG
Program Documents was that the Bank would be likely to continue support at least for the remainder of the
original 5-year program, but that the NREG Mid-Term Review, conducted in July 2010) and the World
Bank ICR process itself would be critical to confirming and shaping that intent.

53. Following the MTR and ICR process, an active dialogue is currently underway on preparation of
a second phase of NREG support from the World Bank. This is expected to involve a further
programmatic DPO series (likely 2 operations). The design will draw on the lessons learnt from the
previous NREG series (see Section 6) through: (i) focusing on a smaller number of key reforms,
complementary to broader investments supported by other DPs, and to FCPF and FIP activities in the
forestry sector; and (ii) including a linked TA operation to strengthen policy analysis and stakeholder
consultation. Focal areas for the DPO and TA operations will be:
    i. Forestry: (i) establish enabling environment for increased private sector, farmers and community
         involvement in forest management, (ii) enhance forest monitoring capacity.
    ii. Mining: (i) strengthen revenue forecasting; (ii) improve environmental management of small scale
         mining activities; (iii) encourage and monitor local procurement of goods and services by the
         mining industry.
    iii. Climate Change: (i) strengthen institutional structures for mainstreaming climate change; and (ii)
         strengthen capacity to design bankable projects and assess climate financing.
    iv. Environmental Management: (i) establish Strategic Environmental Assessment as a mandatory
         environmental management tool for government sectors; and (ii) enhance capacity to manage and
         monitor environmental impacts of large infrastructure development.

3.      Assessment of Outcomes

     3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation (to current country and global
         priorities, and Bank assistance strategy):

54. The development of the NREG PAF was strongly government-led, and drew heavily on joint
analysis supported by the DPs. The operation is therefore generally considered to be well-aligned with
national priorities, although some DPs put particular emphasis on specific activities (e.g. the VPA, which
was strongly supported by the EU), and some key policy areas (e.g. increasing government plantations)
were not emphasized as they were more investment- than policy-focused. The 2009-2010 IMAT review
also concluded that NREG activities were aligned with sector policies, whilst recommending the inclusion
of more institutional development targets, as well as attention to environmental management in the mining
sector. Many of the recommendations made in the CEA were incorporated into the NREG PAF, although
some differences exist:
      The CEA had a strong emphasis on competitive bidding for timber and wildlife management
         concessions, whilst the PAF focused on improving stumpage fee collection, perhaps as a more
         achievable target.



                                                    18
        The CEA focused on community-based natural resource management concepts and the scaling up
         of Ghana‟s Community Resource Management Areas. DPO-1 included assessment of existing
         groups for collaborative forest management (NGOs, CBOs, Protected Areas Management
         Advisory Boards), but subsequent targets focussed on local Forest Forums and dissemination,
         rather than active community management.
        Increasing the supply of legal timber on the domestic market was not recommended in the CEA.
        In the case of the mining sector, most of the CEA‟s recommendations are found in the NREG
         program, but additional activities are included in the PAF, such as the development of corporate
         social responsibility guidelines and the creation of the Multi-agency Revenue Task Force.
        Environmental protection activities, including establishment of an inter-ministerial coordination
         body and the need for a sustainable funding, were taken from the CEA‟s cross-cutting
         recommendations, but climate change strategy and institutionalizing SEA reflect recent priorities.
        The CEA also covered land resources and fisheries, but these were not reflected in PAF due to the
         desire to limit the number of sectors involved.

55. The NREG PDO statement is relevant to policy priorities over the last three years, but was very
broad, and could have provided more focus, particularly in regard to tackling informal forestry and
mining activities. Illegal timber harvesting and artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM – particularly
unregulated gold-mining known locally as galamsey) were already well-recognized at preparation.
Unregulated chainsaw operators are estimated to cut up to 70 percent of the trees harvested in Ghana,
supplying almost all timber for domestic consumption, and galamsey is estimated to employ several times
the formal gold-mining industry workforce. Nevertheless, whilst “forest law enforcement? is mentioned in
the PDO, the emphasis of the PDO indicators and triggers was on ensuring legality of timber supplied by
the formal sector, and informal mining is not explicitly mentioned in the PDO at all. The approach was to
build momentum by tackling more tractable issues first27, and PAF targets related to illegal forestry and
mining emphasized putting in place viable alternatives as part of the approach to “social issues?, rather than
law enforcement. These alternatives, specifically legal sources of domestic wood supply and areas for
establishing regulated ASM cooperatives, have proved hard to identify, however, and the ongoing impact of
the informal sector urges a more explicit and comprehensive strategy.

56. Overall design of the Program was relevant to the objectives, but specific design issues are
apparent. Whilst the use of a DPO was appropriate to the systemic issues that NREG was aiming to
address, tying it into a single instrument with an SBS approach that emphasized predictable inputs to the
annual budget cycle constrained the ability to condition triggers on ambitious reforms, particularly in
contentious and complex sectors such as mining and forestry. In addition, the absence of a separate TA
facility weakened the consistency of ongoing policy analysis that was needed to elaborate incomplete sector
strategies and respond to emerging priorities. Whilst triggers were realistic and generally relevant, there
were specific disconnects with the PDO indicators (as detailed in section 2.1) which compromised the
realism of achieving certain indicators by the end of DPO-3. There was also a disconnect between the
forestry PDOs and the related PDO indicators and triggers. No PDO indicators or triggers clearly addressed
“social issues in forest . . . communities? and the only indicators or triggers related to “forest law
enforcement? were restricted to verification of the formal sector and increasing legal domestic timber
supply. For mining and environment, the PDO indicators and triggers were largely based on outputs, rather
than defining unambiguous outcomes related to the development objectives.




27
 In forestry, it was hoped the establishment of robust FLEGT mechanisms in the formal, export industry under the
VPA would eventually pave the way for extension to domestic timber supply chains.


                                                        19
        3.2     Achievement of Program Development Objectives (including brief discussion of
        causal linkages between policy actions supported by the operation and outcomes):

57. Of the 6 PDO indicators (encompassing 12 targets) three are rated as partially achieved and three
as mostly achieved, but weaknesses in the results framework are more to blame than poor
implementation performance. As noted above and discussed under sections 2.1 and 2.3, there are
numerous disconnects between the triggers to which GoG committed under legal agreements, and the PDO
indicators, which were retrofitted in late 2008 and then largely neglected. In particular, the failure to update
unrealistic indicators during preparation of DPO-3 means that it would be unreasonable to judge
implementation performance solely on the basis of targets that were unachievable under the agreed program
of actions.

58. Achievements in relation to the PDOs have been substantial to the extent that these were
translated into clear triggers and targets:
    (i)     Ensure predictable and sustainable financing for the forestry and wildlife sectors and
            effective forest law enforcement. An emphasis on financial autonomy for FC around the time
            of NREG preparation has since diminished as Government has increased funding. In practice,
            the indicators and targets related to “predictable and sustainable financing? focussed on
            increasing gross forest revenue to Government, and in those terms there has been some success
            through improving revenue collection performance, updating national park fees, and significant
            growth in plantations (which will increase long-term revenues). Fundamental reforms to timber
            fees were largely blocked by industry lobbying, however, and the greatest determinant of
            revenues remains the volume of legally harvested timber, which has recently been in sharp
            decline, especially for high value wild hardwoods. FC has demonstrated its ability to advance
            implementation of a complex international FLEGT agreement, forest reserve boundaries have
            been demarcated, and a significant reduction in the incidence of wildfires has been achieved in
            northern Ghana, following implementation of the FC‟s fire management program to protect
            savanna forests. Achievements in these areas of forest law are at risk of being overshadowed by
            uncontrolled informal harvesting, however, which remains unaffected by efforts to increase
            legal supplies of domestic timber, and will also require attention to issues of tree tenure,
            reliance on wood fuel and strengthened law enforcement.
    (ii)    Improve mining sector revenue collection, management, and transparency. Very
            commendable achievements have been made under this objective. Creation and effective
            operation of the multi-agency Mining Revenue Task Force has clarified that fiscal performance
            is better than the average for international comparators, and has led to a process of both
            simplifying and strengthening of the fiscal regime. Current proposals for the 2012 budget
            would result in significantly higher revenues and a more progressive regime. Ghana has been
            validated as EITI compliant in the minerals sector, and is pioneering application of EITI
            methodologies to local revenue-sharing arrangements. MC has also developed guidelines for
            use of mining revenues by District Assemblies, although its ability to influence the behaviour
            of both Districts and traditional authorities is limited.
    (iii)   Address social issues in forest and mining communities. Greatly increased attention and
            discussion has been focused on conflict and human rights issues in the minerals sector, bringing
            together Government, mining companies and CSOs. Social Responsibility Guidelines for
            mining companies have been developed and disseminated, and monitoring tools developed.
            Although instances of conflict persist, the trend is believed to be positive, and should be subject
            to more systematic monitoring in future. Key social issues for forest communities have been
            less clearly elaborated under NREG, but establishment of district-level Forest Fora has
            provided for more regular consultation between forest managers and local communities.
    (iv)    Mainstream environment into economic growth through Strategic Environmental
            Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment, and development of a climate change


                                                      20
              strategy. Ghana‟s SEA model has been extended to a number of sectors, including the nascent
              oil and gas sector, and to routine local government planning. SEA activities have resulted in
              more transparent and participatory planning, training of more than 100 central Government and
              more than 440 district officials, more funding for environmental activities in sector plans, SEA
              tools being incorporated into NDPC planning guidelines, and mainstreaming of environment in
              government planning as evidenced by (i) strengthening of line agency and district
              environmental units and new budget lines for environmental activities, and (ii) environmental
              issues incorporated into medium-term development plans of all 170 District Assemblies and
              into 10 sector policies / plans. The EPA is now giving training to other African countries on
              mainstreaming environment into their planning system. Sectoral EIA guidelines have been
              developed and EIA service delivery and monitoring has been improved through new on-line
              systems. Awareness of and activity on climate change has greatly increased. An overall climate
              change management framework has been developed as a step towards a comprehensive
              investment plan, and several key sectors, including agriculture, forestry, transport and energy
              are moving ahead with their own climate strategies.

        3.3   Justification of Overall Outcome Rating (combining relevance, achievement of
        PDOs):

        Rating: Moderately Satisfactory

59. NREG was designed to broaden reform within the NRE sectors beyond what could be achieved through
inclusion of one or two targets under the PRSC operations, and it has achieved that goal. Achievements
have been significant, especially viewed in the context of previous NRE sector initiatives. Donors have
been engaged in supporting the NREG sectors for many years in Ghana, often with disappointing outcomes.
Implementation of new sector-based approaches and instruments has been a learning process and design
weaknesses have become apparent, but more has been achieved though NREG than in several previous
projects in terms of specific reforms, and strengthening the institutional platform for continued action (see
section 3.4b). Performance against the stated PDO indicators and broader demonstration of outcomes on the
ground has been compromised by weakness of the M&E framework. Realism is also required in comparing
to what could realistically have been achieved within 3 years, with relatively modest funding, and in the
face of long term negative resource trends driven by complex factors. Nevertheless, it has produced a step
change in the dialogue and government ownership within areas, such as improved revenue management and
transparency, and systematic application of SEA.

        3.4    Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts (if any, where not previously
        covered or to amplify discussion above):

        (a)       Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

60. The Stakeholder & Risk Analysis, conducted during the latter stages of Program preparation as
the first stage of a PSIA, made a number of recommendations for reducing social risks in the NRM
sectors, many of which were pursued by NREG, e.g.: establishing an inter-sectoral coordination
mechanism at Cabinet level; simplifying EIA processes and strengthening related consultation
requirements; developing a policy on corporate social responsibility; encouraging private investment in
forestry; and strengthening the role of communities in forest management. One area in which NREG
activities were identified as potentially increasing social risks was regulation of informal forestry and
mining activities. To date, however, activities undertaken have emphasized carrots rather than sticks,
primarily attempting to identify alternative sources of legal timber for the domestic market and areas where
artisanal mining can be accommodated. The Stakeholder & Risk Analysis concluded that risk of social


                                                      21
conflict was at the heart of the NRM sectors, as a result of discretion in decision-making due to weak
regulatory frameworks and of unclear policies on access and compensation. Conflict has been most evident
in the minerals sector, in the recent past. Activities during the NREG program have begun to lay a
foundation for dealing with these issues. CHRAJ conducted an assessment of human rights issues in the
sector, and a social conflict monitoring tool has been developed.

61. There are some indications that exploitation of Ghana’s natural resources has brought social
development benefits, but a solid information base for assessing NREG’s impact on poverty and
gender issues is only starting to be assembled. A recent (and preliminary) re-assessment of the costs of
environmental degradation in Ghana suggested that increased extraction mineral wealth in the 5 years to
2009 was compensated by increased investments in human capacity28. A focused PSIA of policy reform in
the minerals sector is now underway with support from the Bank PSIA Trust Fund, but the results were not
available in time for inclusion within the ICR. On conflict issues, work remains to be done to strengthen
resolution / redress mechanisms, and to institutionalize regular monitoring of levels, locations and causes in
order to assess the impact of NREG reforms aimed at reducing it, such as development of social
responsibility guidelines, improved transparency around local revenue-sharing, and development of local
content policies.

        (b)    Institutional Change/Strengthening (particularly with reference to impacts on
        longer-term capacity and institutional development):

62. Technical capacity within Government has been enhanced through the NREG program,
particularly in cross-sectoral areas. MC has gained considerably more understanding of social and
revenue management issues through NREG activities, helping to broaden its focus away from simply
promoting mining investments. FC has developed capacity to implement wood-tracking and FLEGT
systems, as well as to strengthen consultation processes with CSOs and local communities. EPA has
improved its capacity to process and track EIA application through its on-line register, and more than 500
government officials have been trained in the use of SEA tools. MoFEP has gained a better understanding
of objectives and activities within the NREG sectors, and is forming a Natural Resources, Environment and
Climate Change unit, which should further strengthen technical engagement in areas such as management
of natural resource revenues and climate finance. A comprehensive capacity needs assessment for the
NREG sectors was never carried out, however, and hiring restrictions continue to place constraints on the
manpower available to MDAs.

63. Institutional strengthening was the focus of the NREG Mid-Term Review (MTR). Considerable
progress has been made through NREG in comparison to earlier donor projects in the NRE sectors
which gave limited attention to broader sector management issues. The MTR employed an EU
conceptual framework for sector budget support based around 5 pillars, namely sector policy, budget and
PFM systems, sector coordination, institutions & capacity, and M&E. Key findings are summarized in
annex 11. Work remains to be done in this area in order to establish a fully effective sector program, but
awareness and willingness to act have been transformed.
     Sector policy: Attention has been given to sector policies under NREG, for instance through review
        of the Forest & Wildlife Policy, and revision of the Minerals Sector Policy. Key priorities and
        strategies would benefit from further clarification, however, in response to evolving issues.
        Numerous NRE objectives have been stated in a range of high level policy documents, and the
        challenge is to: (i) condense these into a single coherent set of high-level objectives for each sector;
        and (ii) fill the missing middle between high-level sector objectives and activity plans with a set of
        clear strategic goals. Policy documents are currently being developed which should address this,

           including a number of strategic plans and a revised Forestry Development Master Plan. The EPA‟s
           draft (2011) Strategic Plan already provides a good model.
          M&E: M&E systems remain weak within the NREG sectors, lacking of a stable set of high-level
           and strategic indicators, but development of sound sector M&E systems is firmly on the agenda.
           The Department of Forestry has been working on a set of sector objectives and has started reporting
           against quantitative annual performance targets, and EPA has set out a sound results framework in
           their draft Strategic Plan, although linkage to high-level objectives and indicators should be
           approved. Agreement has been reached that each of the three key agencies should: (i) incorporate
           clear output indicators in annual Medium-term Expenditure Frameworks (MTEFs29), and (ii)
           develop sector results frameworks which link a coherent set of high-level and strategic objectives to
           SMART30 indicators and targets.
          Budget planning & financial reporting: The quality and comprehensiveness of financial reporting
           within the NREG MDAs has been gradually improving following periodic targeted TA inputs,
           resulting in adoption of up-to-date government MTEF and financial statement formats, and
           recognition of the gains in the NREG sectors in Government Public Expenditure Assessments.
           Work remains to be done to improve inclusivity and credibility of budgeting (particularly reducing
           under-spending) and establishing integrated technical and financial reporting.
          Coordination: The Technical Coordination Committee has generally functioned well.
           Establishment of the ENRAC has been delayed, but it is now operational and expected to provide a
           key platform for defining sector policy going forward. Vertical linkages between MoFEP (and also
           NDPC) and the three NRE agencies have been significantly strengthened. EPA, in particular,
           believes this has been instrumental to mainstreaming environment, particularly in the roll-out of
           SEA tools. Although contentious issues remain between the NREG MDAs over issues such as
           mining within Forest Reserves, dialogue and understanding has increased.
          Civil society engagement: Consultation processes and transparency have increased through a
           number of activities (see section 2.2 and annex 9). Local CSOs are now more actively engaged in
           the ENR sectors, and are learning to work more effectively with media.
          Human capacity: NREG MDAs have established human capacity goals (albeit constrained by
           government restrictions on hiring new staff), and capacity has been built in specific areas via
           NREG, e.g. on PFM, on revenue modelling in the minerals sector, etc. A systematic assessment of
           capacity requirements would be beneficial, however.
          Ownership: There is consensus that the NREG Program has been game-changing in increasing
           government ownership of donor support. From the DPs‟ perspective, challenges remain in terms of
           improving the substance and comprehensiveness of sector dialogue, but expected improvements in
           sector strategies, M&E and reporting will help immensely.

           (c)     Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive and negative):

           N/A

           3.5     Summary of Findings of Stakeholder Workshops:

64. Since the start of the NREG Program, annual Environment and Natural Resources Sector Summits have
been convened, which provide a platform for the NREG MDAs to present and discuss achievements in the
presence of CSOs and media. With support from Kasa, CSOs have held their own meetings ahead of these
summits to elaborate a shared position on sector activities. In general, the CSOs raise a lot of issues and
criticisms of specific activities, particularly within the forestry and mining sectors. They also re-affirm the
need to strengthen and further formalize their own role and community engagement in sector management

activities. But they are very supportive of NREG in general, consistently urging extension of the program to
other natural resource sectors. Annex 2 summarizes discussions from the 2011 Summit.

4.      Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome

        Rating: Moderate

65. Ownership of the NREG program is strong, reforms are largely incremental, and there is little risk that
the main achievements will be reversed – e.g. on the implementation of the VPA, mining revenue scrutiny
through the work of the Task Force and EITI, and promotion of SEA as a key tool for mainstreaming of
environmental concerns. Ongoing financial support to the sectors by EKN and EU until 2013, and planned
additional support from the Bank slightly beyond that should guarantee continuation. There is more risk to
those areas which have been subject to studies and policy dialogue, but where the process of reform is still
at an early stage – e.g. increasing the supply of legal timber to the domestic market, managing ASM and
social conflict in mining sector. Here, ongoing policy engagement and technical support is also needed to
ensure design of workable interventions and maintain momentum.

5.      Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

66. On the side of both the Bank and Borrower, a huge amount of hard work and dedication was put
into the NREG Program, and has resulted in significant achievements. Where achievements have not
matched initial expectations, it has been largely due to the adjustment to a new modality of support and
related structural issues that were not fully addressed, rather than to a lack of effort or commitment.

        5.1     Bank Performance

        (a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry:

67. Overall, the Bank preparation team produced a valiant effort to convene both DPs and
government agencies and construct a complex and coordinated program responding closely to the
findings of the CEA. The Bank is regarded by both Government and DPs as having played a critical role in
the development of the NREG Program and much of the analytical work that under-pinned it, motivating
and coordinating other development partners, and providing much of the drive and international experience
for the development of a sector support program. Mobilization of a PHRD grant during the preparation
phase also started to lay a systematic basis for addressing broad sector management and governance issues,
including on PFM, stakeholder analysis, etc.

68. A number of issues were identified and discussed, but not fully resolved, during preparation,
including provision for systematic TA support, institutional strengthening and a complementary civil
society facility. The PAF was also overly extensive and output-focused, with poorly defined outcome
objectives and indicators. The selection of triggers left some disconnect with the PDOs related to forestry,
and insufficient focus on the informal mining and forestry, or on environmental impacts of mining. To the
extent that these issues were not sufficiently addressed during supervision, some responsibility is also
shared with the design of a combined DPO-SBS instrument which reduced subsequent flexibility.

69. The performance of the Bank preparation team must be viewed in context of the limitations on
independent action, and the novelty of the approach. When the Bank joined NREG preparation, it was a
minor financial contributor looking to influence, rather than direct the approach taken by other DPs, who


                                                     24
under an SBS modality had a slightly different set of priorities. Even after the Bank contribution was
increased, freedom of action was constrained, as evidenced by the appeal other DPs made directly to the
World Bank Board to block the inclusion of oil and gas sector issues in NREG. Sector DPOs, especially for
natural resources and environmental management, were a relatively new instrument in Africa, as was the
approach of combining one with a multi-donor SBS program. Programmatic DPO series were considered
very flexible instruments, and therefore assumed to provide for adaptive management during
implementation. Also, at the time of preparation, the template for results frameworks under DPOs was less
clearly developed and standardized than at present.

        (b) Quality of Supervision:

        Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

70. The supervision team inherited a complex program structure including multiple sectors and a
broad technical agenda, but managed to deliver DPOs in both of the two years following DPO-1.
Delivery of DPO-2 and -3 to schedule was a considerable achievement, helping to maintain momentum and
belief in the NREG process, and contrasting with the typical experience of slippages in sector programmatic
DPO series, including in the case of both the other environment / natural resource DPOs in the Africa
Region, in Gabon & Cameroon.

71. The processing requirements for these annual operations imposed a burden, however,
particularly given the need to coordinate across multiple sectors and donors. In a reversal of its
perception as a galvanizing force during preparation, the Bank was now seen as difficult to deal with due to
the heavy process requirements of preparing new operations each year. These requirements constrained the
annual Program cycle, whilst also diminishing the quality of technical interactions around the policy
content. GoG technical staff complained that Bank technical engagement was limited, and which led to
divergence in expectations over the form in which triggers should be met. DPs also felt that there was less
Bank engagement in joint decision-making in comparison with the preparation phase.

72. Efforts were made to address outstanding design issues, but with limited results. Given the
complex operating environment and resistance to major changes, it is likely that there would have
been a trade-off between effecting more fundamental changes and adhering to the anticipated
disbursement schedule. The Bank-led process to streamline the PAF required significant effort was spent
during preparation of DPO-2, and led to substantial, if incremental improvements, but was poorly received
by MDAs, as it was felt to be at odds with government-led processes. Efforts to improve broader M&E
systems also received a sluggish response. Support on sector planning and budgeting systems came mostly
from the Netherlands Embassy, as did the direct support to civil society. Although perfectly appropriate in
the context of donor division of labor, this generated an impression in some quarters that the Bank was
insufficiently focused on the civil society aspects of NREG. Potentially, more effort could have been made
by the Bank to improve provision of TA, M&E, and the overall focus on and clarity of objectives, but
considering the time and political capital required, any fundamental changes would probably have meant
delaying the schedule of operations. The amount of staff time spent on NREG during DPO-3 preparation
dropped significantly31 in comparison to previous years, perhaps because pushing for major changes seemed
less appropriate just prior to the end of the agreed period of support and to the scheduled MTR and ICR
reviews.

73. Following approval of DPO-1, the documentation of the management of NREG is fairly sparse.
The Program was supervised from the country office and Aide Memoires and ISRs essentially reflected the

31
  35 staff weeks in FY10 as opposed to nearly 60 during FY09 and slightly less than 100 during the original
preparation of the Program in FY07/08.

achievement of triggers and processing of new operations, rather than chronicling substantive sector and
technical discussions related to the Program32.

        (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance:

        Rating: Moderately unsatisfactory

74. NREG was a valuable, ambitious and in some respects experimental undertaking, for which Bank
leadership was both critical and highly appreciated. The new approach brought significant benefits in
terms of specific policy achievements and advancing broader sector management and governance
issues, but it also represented a high risk strategy in the context of a multi-sectoral operation with
weak existing sector systems. Inevitably weaknesses became apparent in the design. These were identified
relatively early, but the complexity of the Program, working across 5 MDAs, plus MoFEP, with 4 DPs in
addition to the Bank, and under a modality that emphasized government leadership, made it difficult to
effect timely changes, particularly in the short window between effectiveness of one operation and
preparation of the next. Ultimately, supervision prioritized adherence to the expected disbursement schedule
and letting the initial years run their course, over pushing hard for profound early changes. It also stressed
maintaining Bank support and engagement in the joint sector program, as opposed to focusing efforts on the
much smaller number of triggers. That approach has achieved significant results, and allowed GoG to learn
from their own experience, but it also permitted certain weaknesses to persist.

        5.2      Borrower Performance

        (a) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance33:

        Rating: Moderately satisfactory

75. GoG maintained a high degree of engagement and activity across a very broad multi-sectoral
agenda, with strong involvement from MoFEP and NPDC in sector activities. Progress has been
impressive in a number of important areas, such as the implementation of the VPA, analysis of mining
revenues, the application of SEA tools to government planning, and the establishment of more efficient and
monitorable on-line processing systems for EIAs. In other areas, progress has been slower, including the
management of ASM activities, providing a sustainable supply of timber to the domestic market and
revising revenue structures for the timber industry. Strong engagement at the technical level, was not
always matched at the senior policy level, which limited progress on the most contentious issues. The lack
of well-defined policy priorities contributed to the difficulty of securing high-level attention, but
establishment of ENRAC should provide a strong foundation for future engagement. Strong leadership from
MoFEP was instrumental to achievements, but staffing constraints also limited MoFEP‟s ability to
effectively manage centralized TA activities under the PHRD and later in support of M&E strengthening,
which retarded the development of sector management systems.

76. Issues that arose should be seen in the context of the novelty of the instrument to NREG MDAs
accustomed to an investment projects, and the need to adjust to new modalities. The change to sector
budget support involves much more freedom in the use of funds, but less structured support for design and

   A December 5 2008 Aide Memoire summarized discussions on PFM and streamlining the PAF in November 2008,
but AMs since initial preparation have reflected little technical (as opposed procedural) detail.
33
   Although the NREG implementing agencies are distinct, they include all the key MDAs responsible for
implementation in the targeted areas, obviating the need for separate assessment of the performance of government in
addition to the implementing agencies.


                                                         26
management of activities, broader requirements on reporting and sharing of sector information, and higher-
level accountability than is the case for a narrowly focused set of project activities:
     The onus is on the implementing agency to determine and put in place the additional staff, TA, etc.
        to absorb the additional funding and associated transaction costs. Lagging budget performance of
        NREG MDAs exposed the limitations of the human resources made available, but efficiency of the
        working arrangements has been improved over time, and the number of activities expected at the
        start was probably unrealistic.
     During PAF assessments, DPs expressed frustration at the MDAs‟ focus on delivery of outputs,
        rather than discussing their content in the context of broader sector goals. This suggests the need for
        a attitudinal shift from reporting on a limited set of activities to comprehensive sector dialogue, and
        also for understanding the distinction between triggers and MoVs.
     Complaints from GoG officers at the technical level that they are unable to guarantee high-level
        policy approvals are understandable, but not ultimately acceptable within the context of a DPO.

77. Sector management and work processes have improved. Sectors in Ghana with established sector
budget support operations, such as health and education, have also taken time to adjust to new ways
of doing business. Although ultimately the responsibility lies with government to deliver, DPs need to
support the transition through clarity on requirements. Progress in NREG has likely been constrained
by the lack of precision on strengthening of sector systems, and the overly extensive and output-focused
PAF. The lack of attention given to defining a limited set of priority outcome objectives diluted the focus of
implementers and decision-makers34. This is particularly the case in Ghana, where rapid development and
enthusiasm for innovation already tax attentions. GoG is keen to vigorously engage on many innovative
programs, such as FLEGT, EITI, climate change, SEA, etc., but staff and leadership attention is limited,
making the need to focus on priority deliverables all the more critical. Stronger existing sector strategies
would have avoided many problems, and this gap should have received more attention from the outset.

6.         Lessons Learned

78. The transition from financing individual projects to sector budget support (SBS) rejuvenated
ownership, and revolutionized multi-agency dialogue. Although difficult to quantify, the adoption of an
SBS program based around a government-led target-setting process resulted in a much greater sense of
ownership, empowerment and enthusiasm amongst the implementing MDA than previous, discrete project
investments. It also engendered a far more active dialogue between the sector MDAs, and more substantive
engagement with both MoFEP and NDPC. Particularly in the case of the environment, this engagement was
considered crucial to improving the understanding of environmental and climate change issues, and to
mainstreaming environment through e.g. development of SEA tools for government planning. It has also
allowed effective collaboration on financial performance, particularly in regard to the work of the Revenue
Management Task Force in the mineral sector.

79. A sector support program should be conditioned on solid sector planning, monitoring and
reporting. Fundamental building blocks of a sector budget support program were not in place within the
implementing MDAs at the start of NREG, particularly clear and comprehensive strategies, resource
planning and M&E systems. As a result, there have been weaknesses in budget realism and execution. More
fundamentally, a lack of clarity in overall program goals and appropriate indicators compromised
demonstration of results. Weaknesses were both understandable and clearly identified at the outset, and
have been subject to considerable incremental improvement over the three years of the Program.
Nevertheless, general assurances to improve these systems in the Framework Memorandum should have
been hard-wired through clear milestones and conditionality, to ensure basic pre-requisites of an effective
sector program were in place in more timely fashion.
34
     And also made it harder to evaluate the progress that was made.


                                                            27
80. The NREG Progress Assessment Framework (PAF) was too broad and output-focused during the
first three years; a policy matrix should focus on a small number of strategic and highly
consequential reforms to avoid losing the wood for the trees. The NREG PAF included a large number
of targets (initially 66, later reduced to around 40), many of which were based on outputs that were more
investment- than policy-focused, or yielded opaque policy outcomes (i.e., draft policy documents of
indeterminate status). This tended to obscure the dialogue on key policy reforms and outcomes. More time
was spent tracking and assessing a myriad of small activities and outputs, than on identifying strategic
priorities and analyzing the political economy or engaging senior decision-makers around critical reforms.
Bank disbursements were based on a more selective set of 6 annual triggers, which attracted greater-than-
average attention and levels of achievement. But the triggers were not qualitatively different from the far
larger number of PAF targets from which they were drawn, and upon which most efforts were concentrated.
The size of the PAF was recognized as a weakness from the outset, but once the precedent was set, major
changes were hard to effect. Ultimately, reforming the PAF was very difficult without first strengthening
sector strategies and planning tools (such as MTEFs and multi-year results frameworks). Ideally, the PAF
would have been drawn from these, but instead partially substituted for them.

81. Development policy lending has limitations when used as the primary vehicle of support to a
sector program, and may be more effective when complementing other instruments. NREG was
worked in two parallel arenas – policy reform (the primary focus of DPOs) and strengthening sector
management systems (the primary focus of SBS). These should be complementary, but delivery through a
single instrument may have complicated both. The SBS modality emphasized broad engagement in sector
activities rather than focusing on select policy issues, whereas use of a World Bank DPO template as the
key program document encouraged the use of the PAF as a primary planning tool and de-emphasized
specific investments in sector systems, such as M&E and TA. A broad sector program, addressing
challenges in institutional capacity as well as policy reform, may be better supported by a DPO in
conjunction with other types of instruments. In practice, sector DPOs, such as the forestry and environment
DPO in Cameroon, are often supported by an additional TA facility. Structured TA support would have
been especially important in NREG as the initial analytical work established a policy agenda, but not the
detailed reforms needed to pursue it.

82. Working across three sectors (forestry, mining and environment including climate change),
involving 5 MDAs and MoFEP, and harmonizing inputs of 5 DPs, multiplied transaction costs.
Structures should have been put in place to manage this complexity. Given the context at preparation,
shortly after the Accra Declaration and with only a modest initial contribution from the Bank, NREG
probably could not have gone ahead except as a multi-donor program. The multi-sector approach provided
sufficient gravitas to the program to attract strong engagement from both MoFEP and DPs, and also
strengthened cross-sector learning and cooperation. But multiple sectors and donors greatly increased
transaction, and the Bank found its freedom of action constrained. A more structured division of labor
between DPs would have increased efficiency, and could have been achieved through:
      A formal agreement between the DPs on areas of technical leadership and additional TA inputs
         (such as support for a PSIA);
      Differentiation of disbursement triggers between DPs in line with areas of technical focus; and/or
      Donor coordination based on unity of purpose rather than unity of process, i.e., designing a range of
         instruments coordinated around a single sector dialogue, rather than consolidating all inputs into
         one instrument.
One possibility would have been for the other NREG DPs to support a core SBS program based around
institutional strengthening and TA, whilst the WB DPOs focused specifically on identifying critical policy
reforms, and on high-level engagement around them. PRSC series regularly combine many sectors and




                                                    28
donors in annual operations35, but tend to be able to draw on policy dialogue supported by a range of
separate sector activities, and do not get into the level of detail of sector implementation as the NREG SBS.

83. The complexity of the policy agenda in the NREG sectors required more time and flexibility in
timing to implement ambitious reforms. The NREG policy environment is complex and demanded
ongoing policy analysis and adaptive management, for instance to address the serious challenges posed by
diffuse, informal sector activities in Ghana. However, NREG was envisaged as an SBS program with
annual disbursements providing a predictable budget supplement to each of the implementing MDAs.
Annual DPOs left less than 6 months between disbursal of one operation to delivery of prior actions for the
next, and practically no window to assess outcomes from the preceding set of actions. The imperative to
adhere to annual budget cycles constricted the space in which to address systemic issues (e.g., to strengthen
strategy, M&E or provision of TA), and created pressure to retreat from ambitious targets, rather than to
pursue contentious policy reforms36. Flexibility on the timing of targets should not have had a severe impact
on the implementation of work plans given that spending by the NREG MDAs has lagged behind budgets
and available funds. It has also been the case for many other sector DPOs, particularly in the NRE sectors37.
The CEA noted that “DPs are supporting a reform process that is not linear, and engagement mechanisms
must be flexible, responsive, and capable of being scaled up or down as appropriate.? Locking all
disbursements into the same, rigid schedule hindered a graduated and flexible response to performance.

7.       Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

         (a)      Borrower/Implementing Agencies:

84. Borrower comments (see annex 3) reflect appreciation for sector-based support and pride in
achievements, but also reveal some of the frustrations and difficulties in the dialogue around the use of the
new instrument, particularly in terms of results requirements that diverge from those of investment
operations. The flexibility and additional autonomy of budget support are welcomed, but there is still an
expectation that funding should be provided up front, and that activities and outputs are sufficient measures
of progress. Such frustrations would have been reduced by: (i) clearer sector strategies, providing for
mutual understanding of the expected linkage between activities and results from the outset, and distinct
from the PAF so that changes to PAF milestones would not be seen as changes to the sector program itself;
(ii) a smaller set of targets, which could be more reliably delivered, rather than setting numerous annual
targets, at least some of which would inevitably slip; and (iii) more results-oriented phrasing of targets to
avoid confounding the means of verification (e.g., a report) with the target (i.e., an unambiguous measure of
progress towards a specified goal as evidenced in the report). Issues raised on donor coordination and flow
of funds also reflect teething problems of introducing a new approach.

         (b)      Cofinanciers: N/A




35
   And also involve huge transaction costs and time to develop effective working relations – e.g. see the ICR for
PRSCs 1-3 in Ghana.
36
   For instance, 2 successive triggers on development and implementation of a Financial Framework for the FC were
assessed as achieved on the basis of financial reports, despite proposals for revising forestry fees being largely
blocked.
37
   The multi-sectoral Gabon NRM DPO achieved concrete targets across diverse sectors, after considerable delays to
the release of the 2nd tranche that reflected the need for time to overcome resistance to reforms. Experience with sector
policy lending across many countries suggests that initial time-lines for ambitious reform programs are typically over-
optimistic.

Annex 2.    Stakeholder Workshop Report and Results

The 3rd Environment and Natural Resources Stakeholder Summit was held in July 2011, involving
112 participants representing GoG (including the Ministers of Lands & Natural Resources and of
Environment, Science & Technology, and the CEOs of FC, MC & EPA), traditional authorities,
more than a dozen NGO representatives, several DPs, and a small number of private sector
organizations. The Summits largely present an opportunity for the NREG MDAs to present annual
progress for discussion, but the 2011 Summit also included presentations from representatives of
chainsaw operators and the National Association of Small-scale Miners, who stressed the
importance and their willingness to work together to find comprehensive approaches to informal
forestry and mining activities that recognized the reality that these activities are well-established,
economically important, and do not focus simply on a law enforcement response. As in previous
years, a communiqué was presented from a parallel civil society review of the sectors, which was
supported by Kasa and involved more than a hundred CSO representatives. The following notes
summarize main points presented in the civil society review and/or discussed during the Summit in
response to the GoG presentations.

A number of GoG activities were particularly commended:
    The formation of the Environment and Natural Resources Advisory Committee (ENRAC)
     to bring together key ministers for senior policy coordination and guidance.
    FC‟s attempts to increase the involvement of CSOs, especially in the VPA process and in
     the review and formulation of a new Forest and Wildlife Policy.
    The establishment of the AKOBEN system by EPA for environmental rating and public
     disclosure of large private sector developments, including mining operations.
    The general effectiveness of the NREG Program for highlighting issues and promoting
     policy reform, transparency and engagement was recognized in the request that additional
     sectors be included under the Program, including fisheries and land degradation /
     desertification issues.

However, more efforts were urged in a number of areas. To further promote civil society
participation and transparency, the following were proposed:
     An NREG communication and media strategy, including more frequent programs on key
        issues, establishment of a media resource center, and an awards program to recognise
        quality journalism on NRE issues.
     Disclosure of environmental audits of mines.
     Strengthened representation of CSOs on the FC Board.
     Publication of a list of timber rights holders and status of their financial obligations.
     Clearer reporting back on activities and achievement in relation to the agreements of
        previous Summits.
     Increased participation of the private sector in the Summits and in consultation structures
        more generally.

In relation to specific policy issues, the following were proposed:
     Minerals – MC‟s mission statement should emphasize promotion of local investment and
         linkages to local economies, rather than simply providing a more attractive environment for


                                                 32
    external investment. Mining should not be allowed in forest reserves. New mining
    developments should be subject to free prior informed consent of local communities,
    comprehensive cost-benefit analysis, and the principle of polluter pays.
   Forestry – More should be done to promote establishment and operation of Community
    Resource Management Areas, and SMEs in the forestry sector. More should be done to
    increase the legal supply of timber for the domestic market. Gender analysis should be
    included in review of the Forest and Wildlife Policy.
   Environment – Development of the comprehensive Climate Change Policy Framework
    should be accelerated, and emphasis should be given to local adaptation needs. Application
    of the AKOBEN scheme should be extended to additional projects and developments,
    including in the state sector.

Annex 3.    Summary of Borrower’s Comments on Draft ICR

The document has been well written and the issues well articulated, including both the programme
design and the implementation. We generally agree with most of the challenges mentioned,
especially those faced by GOG, and certainly that the programme was complex. We would
question why the Borrower performance rating is only moderately satisfactory instead of
satisfactory, given that triggers of all the 3 DPOs were met.

We would like to highlight a number of issues which presented particular challenges from the
Government perspective:
    Donor dialogue. Donor coordination and harmonization was not strong enough, which
      produced heavy transactions cost, and sometimes parallel discussions on the same topics.
      Development partners (DPs) also wanted numerous changes in the focus and objectives of
      the programme.
    Differing expectations of MoVs. Even where the means of verification (MoV) for a target
      was provided, DPs in certain instances rated the performance as “partially achieved?. For
      example if an MOV states “Report of Exploration? it means that we have to produce a
      report on mineral exploration work being carried out in the area. It does not necessarily
      mean that the exploration should have been finished as it is a complex process.
    Impatience for results. Reform processes take time, and the activities conducted under
      NREG were designed to lead to longer-term outcomes. Hence the suggestion by some DPs
      that they are not seeing results is too premature at this stage. For example, to address the
      explosion of illegal mining activities in Ghana due to the unprecedented rise in gold prices,
      a quick fix could be following by simply using security agencies to flush out illegal miners
      to, but this is not a sustainable method of solving the problem as it will simply push them
      elsewhere, or they will return after a short time, and in the meantime conflict with formal
      mines and authorities is increased. It is not realistic to see instantaneous results in dealing
      with the illegal small scale mining problem.
    Delays in release of funds. DPs generally released funds late in each fiscal year for which
      the activities were supposed to take place, with the result that there were constraints on
      funding and some activities and targets were then deferred to the next year. The time taken
      to process internal applications for release of funds to the implementing agencies was also
      part of the problem.


Having noted some problems, however, we also want to emphasis that on balance, NREG has been
a very positive development. Sector Budget Support has proven for us to be the most efficient
method of DP support, and the programme has been very useful in resourcing the NREG sectors to
address most of their challenges. Financing of the sectors have also increased tremendously from
the 2008 levels through both DP and GoG contributions. Furthermore, intersectoral collaboration
amongst the NREG agencies is stronger than ever before.

We particularly want to highlight the following specific achievements in each of the sectors:




                                                 34
1) Environment
     Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) is emerging as a major tool for developing and
       analyzing Government policies, plans and programmes (PPPs) to ensure that they
       adequately mainstream sustainability. Decision-makers have increasing confidence that
       SEA enhances sustainability of policy and planning frameworks. SEA activities have
       resulted in more transparent and participatory planning, training of more than 100 central
       Government and more than 440 district officials, more funding for environmental activities
       in sector plans, SEA tools being incorporated into NDPC planning guidelines, and
       mainstreaming of environment in government planning as evidenced by (i) strengthening of
       line agency and district environmental units and new budget lines for environmental
       activities, and (ii) environmental issues incorporated into medium-term development plans
       of all 170 District Assemblies and into 10 sector policies / plans. The EPA is now giving
       training to other African countries on how Ghana achieved so much success in
       mainstreaming environment into their planning system.
     Online EIA registration has helped shorten the EIA process and strengthen decentralization
       of the EIA system in Ghana. It has also helped EPA improve its record keeping of projects
       which have followed the EIA process.

2) Forestry
Notwithstanding the challenges encountered during implementation, the NREG programme has
significantly improved the business processes within the forestry sector including the following:
     Revision of Forest and Wildlife Policy
     Improved systems for securing forest boundaries
     Increased revenue collection rates and improved disbursement mechanisms
     Enhanced dialogued processes between major stakeholders (private sector, civil society
        organizations, resource owners and forest fringe communities)

3) Minerals
There is now better collaboration between sectors, evidenced by the joint work of EPA and MC to
strengthen environmental guidelines for the mining sector. Substantial progress has been made
towards a solution to unregulated mining by identifying areas to be set aside for formalized small-
scale mining under organized cooperatives. Under the NREG programme, about 61 areas which
had been blocked out countrywide for demarcation to small scale miners are now under a process
of being explored. So far 7 of these areas are under exploration and 8 more will be added next year
subject to availability of funds. However, robust processes take time, and progress in both these
areas will not be reflected in immediate major changes on the ground.
Also, in an attempt to reduce social conflict in mining communities, fiscal models have been
developed and are being applied to the mining companies to monitor mineral revenues that mining
companies pay to Government. The model has been applied to various mines in the country. In
addition, Guidelines for use of mineral royalties at the local level have been developed. Similarly,
Guidelines for Corporate Social Responsibility by Mining Companies in Mining Communities
have been developed and sensitization of the various Districts and Municipal Assemblies as well
as all stakeholders is on-going.

Development Partner feedback on the findings of the ICR was not received in time for inclusion.
The DP Sector Leader (representative from EKN; joint head of the GoG-DP Sector Working
Group) provided some factual updates in response to the draft document, but due to pre-occupation
with Durban Climate Change meetings, and then the end-of-year holidays, formal comments on
the conclusions of the ICR was not provided before the end of Decemember 2011.

Annex 9. Participation and Demand For Good Governance mechanisms in the NRE sectors

Ghana is seen as a leader in promoting good governance within West Africa, and has relatively strong
formal institutions, such as parliament, local government, the judiciary and the press. Activities under
NREG have reached beond these basic building blocks for engaging with broader society around natural
resources issues.

Across NRE sectors:
    Ghana is now EITI compliant. Much revenue information is already available for the mining
      sector, and EITI is being extended to the oil & gas and forestry sectors. EITI has also shown that
      strong multi-stakeholder collaboration between government, CSOs and private sector is possible
      and can lead to strong outcomes.
    A lot of dialogue on NREG issues with a range of stakeholders is already happening. Most GoG
      agencies in the NREG sector already have some consultation mechanisms for sharing
      information and discussing ideas with civil society and the private sector.
    KASA civil society funding mechanism. Although only a short-term (18-month) pilot, Kasa has
      already yielded lots of valuable lessons on the best way to support CSOs in this sector. It has
      helped to solidify some coalitions of CSOs in the sectors such as mining, forestry, water, etc…

Innovations that have worked well in particular sectors:
    Forest Fora have engaged forestry officers more pro-actively with local communities, and have
      worked closely with the Forest Watch Coalition on processes like the VPA.
    EPA has developed the AKOBEN rating and disclosure system “to motivate companies to
      improve their performance? in terms of compliance with environmental laws and regulations.
      AKOBEN explicitly recognizes the importance of public awareness in incentivizing
      environmental performance.
    The Commission on Human Rights and Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) has taken an active
      interest in conflict issues in the mining sector, carrying out an independent investigation of
      allegations of human rights abuse and conflict. The challenge now is to follow up on their
      report‟s findings more systematically, including through the legal system in some cases.
    The Minerals Commission is building knowledge and capacity to better respond to social
      issues in the mining sector. They commissioned a baseline study of conflicts in the mining
      communities, and have developed guidelines for Social Responsibility of large mining
      companies and for use of mining revenues by District Assemblies. They have also formed two
      District Mining Committees as a pilot platform for increased local consultation (drawing in part
      on the Forest Forum model). They have also recruited a senior social specialist to lead this work.

Annex 10. Six main risks identified at the appraisal of DPO-1

   ? Political risks – the main risks are the that natural resources and environmental governance are
     highly political and contested; moreover, the December 2008 Ghanaian presidential and
     parliamentary election might impact the policy reforms and lead to an increased level of
     spending

   ? Risks of a weak public finance management – the main risk associated with weak PFM are (i)
     low capacity of sector ministries, departments, and agencies to prepare comprehensive works
     plans that are costed, (ii) low budget ceilings given to line ministries to accommodate the
     additional financing requirement for the NREG program, (iii) delays in the release of funds

   ? Economic risks - Changes in the global economy or disruptions in the domestic economic may
     lead to a slow down in growth; an increase in non-concessional borrowing could result into debt
     distress

   ? Environmental risks – Unintended negative environmental effects may include attracting
     investment into the forest and wildlife sector, diversification of the mineral production,
     integration of mining into the economy, and technical focus on environment that neglects
     capacity to deliver on social and environmental realities at local level. Also increase revenue to
     the sector and boosting employment, this could induce greater rates of extraction

   ? Social risks – the three main risks comprise (i) the blockage of reforms by elites and powerful
     interest groups, (ii) negatively impact on the vulnerable groups and increase gender differences
     due to the NREG intervention and (iii) a limited participation of citizens due to insufficient
     benefits accruing to local communities and an increase of social conflict, at last in the initial
     stage, as a result of distributional asymmetries becoming publicly visible

   ? Risk of Misperception – the Bank‟s involvement could be misperceived as only aiming to
     increase revenues from extractive industries with little concern for social or environmental
     impact

Annex 11. Key findings of the NREG Mid-Term Review (August 2010) on sector management
systems

         A sector policy should be updated and clarified beyond the broad objectives laid out in the
          Letters of Development Policy. The 2009 Statement of Policies on Natural Resources and
          Environment, provides a good start, but was largely donor-driven, and should be more
          focused and specific. Medium-term strategies for each of the NREG sub-sectors are also
          needed to link policy objectives to specific targets that will inform annual plans. There is also
          need for more stability in the planning process to avoid of multiple incompletely
          implemented plans and strategies. Currently, a National Environment Policy is being drafted,
          and the FC intends to begin work on a vision for the forestry sector.

         The budget management capacity of the NREG agencies was weak at the outset of NREG,
          lacking medium term budget frameworks, annual work plans linked to consolidated budgets,
          and adequate reporting systems. The Framework Memorandum gave insufficient focus to
          PFM within the NREG agencies. Absorption of funds during the initial years has been low,
          but with technical assistance from EKN, budget management improved during DPO-2 and
          DPO-3: (i) an annual public finance action plan for 2009 and 2010 was drafted for
          strengthening financial programming and financial management; (ii) NREG activities were
          mainstreamed into the Annual Budget and the MTEF (2010-2012); and (iii) budget
          comprehensiveness improved with reporting by the FC and EPA on all funding sources.

         The Technical Coordinating Committee has been generally effective for sector coordination
          at the senior technical level, but the establishment of the ENRAC has been delayed, and
          involvement of civil society, especially the private sector, is not fully institutionalized.

         Lack of clarity on the respective roles of the NREG agencies vs their line ministries is one of
          the biggest institutional weaknesses. In the case of the EPA, clarification of roles has been a
          target within the PAF, but delivery was delayed and the draft National Environment Policy
          makes no mention of MEST. General capacity constraints are also an issue, more within MC
          and EPA, than FC. During preparation, there was considerable discussion around TA
          provision, but it was decided not to develop a parallel TA operation to avoid diluting
          government ownership. A planned comprehensive assessment of sectoral TA needs never
          took place, and whilst GoG have used NREG funding on TA, including senior international
          experts in the case of mining revenues, there is a general perception amongst DPs and some
          acceptance within GoG that the quantity and quality of TA has not been ideal, and the quality
          of outputs has suffered as a result.

         There has been limited progress on the establishment of routine sector M&E systems to date,
          but an initial scoping assessment has been conducted, and the need for such systems, linked
          to sector strategies, is accepted within each of the three NREG agencies.
