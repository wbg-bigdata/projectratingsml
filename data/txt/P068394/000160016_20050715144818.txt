        OED Mission: Enhancing developmenteffectiveness throughexcellenceand independenceinevaluation.


 About this Report
        The Operations Evaluation Departmentassesses the programsand activities of the World Bank for two purposes:
 first, to ensurethe integrity of the Bank's self-evaluation process and to verify that the Bank's work is producing the
 expected results,and second, to helpdevelop improved directions, policies,and proceduresthroughthe disseminationof
 lessonsdrawnfrom experience.As part of this work, OED annually assessesabout 25 percent of the Bank's lending
 operations. Inselecting operationsfor assessment, preferenceis given to those that are innovative,large, or complex;
 those that are relevantto upcomingstudies or countryevaluations: thosefor which ExecutiveDirectors or Bank
 managementhave requested assessments;and those that are likelyto generateimportantlessons.The projects, topics,
 and analyticalapproaches selected for assessment support larger evaluationstudies.
        A Project Performance Assessment Report (PPAR) is based on a review of the ImplementationCompletion Report
 (a self-evaluation by the responsible Bank department) and fieldwork conducted by OED. To prepare PPARs, OED staff
 examine project files and other documents, interview operational staff, and in most cases visit the borrowing country for
 onsite discussions with project staff and beneficiaries. The PPAR thereby seeks to validate and augment the
 informationprovided in the ICR,as well as examine issues of special interestto broader OED studies.
        Each PPAR is subject to a peer review process and OED managementapproval. Once cleared internally,the
 PPAR is reviewed by the responsible Bank department and amended as necessary. The completed PPAR is then sent
 to the borrower for review; the borrowers'comments are attached to the document that is sent to the Bank's Board of
 ExecutiveDirectors. After an assessment report has been sent to the Board, it is disclosed to the public.


 About the OED Rating System
        The time-tested evaluation methods used by OED are suited to the broad range of the World Bank's work. The
 methods offer both rigor and a necessarylevel of flexibility to adapt to lending instrument, project design, or sectoral
 approach. OED evaluators all apply the same basic method to arrive at their project ratings. Following is the definition
 and rating scale used for each evaluationcriterion (more information is available on the OED website:
 http://worldbank.org/oed/eta-mainpage.html).
        Relevanceof Objectives: The extent to which the project's objectives are consistent with the country's current
 development priorities and with current Bank country and sectoral assistance strategies and corporate goals
 (expressedin Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, Country Assistance Strategies, Sector Strategy Papers, Operational
 Policies).Possible ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
        Efficacy: The extent to which the project's objectives were achieved, or expected to be achieved, taking into
 account their relative importance. Possible rafings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
        Efficiency:The extent to which the project achieved, or is expected to achieve, a return higher than the
 opportunitycost of capital and benefits at least cost compared to alternatives. Possible ratings: High, Substantial,
 Modest, Negligible.This rating is not generally applied to adjustment operations.
        Sustainability:The resilience to risk of net benefits flows over time. Possible ratings: Highly Likely, Likely,
 Unlikely, Highly Unlikely, Not Evaluable.
        InstitutionalDevelopment Impact: The extent to which a project improves the ability of a country or regionto
 make more efficient, equitable and sustainable use of its human, financial, and natural resourcesthrough: (a) better
 definition, stability, transparency, enforceability, and predictability of institutional arrangements and/or (b) better
 alignment of the mission and capacity of an organization with its mandate, which derives from these institutional
 arrangements. Institutional Development Impact includes both intended and unintended effects of a project. Possible
 ratings: High, Substantial, Modest, Negligible.
        Outcome:The extent to which the project's major relevant objectives were achieved, or are expected to be
 achieved, efficiently. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Moderately Satisfactory, Moderately
 Unsatisfactory,Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
        Bank Performance: The extent to which services provided by the Bank ensured quality at entry and supported
 implementationthrough appropriate supervision (including ensuring adequate transition arrangements for regular
 operationof the project). Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory, Highly Unsatisfactory.
        Borrower Performance: The extent to which the borrower assumed ownership and responsibility to ensure quality
 of preparationand implementation, and complied with covenants and agreements, towards the achievementof
 developmentobjectives and sustainability. Possible ratings: Highly Satisfactory, Satisfactory, Unsatisfactory,Highly
 Unsatisfactory.

Summary

        Inthe last century, Turkey experienced 130earthquakes(5.0 magnitude and
above) which caused approximately 80,000 casualties, 54,000 injuries, and heavy damage
to 450,000 buildings. Between 1992 and 1999 alone, earthquakesinTurkey killed some
 18,000 people andcaused an estimated $20 billion indamage.

        Turkey i s ranked among the Bank's top 10 borrowers for natural disaster recovery
andmanagement, and is the recipient o fthe largest single fundingpackage assembledby
the Bank inresponseto a natural disaster to date - $1.2 billionfollowing the Mamma
earthquake in 1999. Since 1992, the Bank has responded to six disaster emergencies in
the context o f four loans, three of which are assessed inthis report:

    0   Erzincan Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (L35 11-TR)
        (the "Erzincan" project); Disasters addressed: Erzincan earthquake, March 1992,
        6.8 on the Richter scale; Landslides in Senirkent, July 1995, and Siitqiiler,
        November 1995.
    0   Emergency Flood and EarthquakeRecovery Project (L4388-TR) (the
        "TEFER' project); Disasters addressed: Landslides andflooding in the Western
        Black Sea region, May 1998;Adana earthquake, June 27, 1998, 6.3 on the
        Richter scale.
    0   Emergency Earthquake Recovery Project (Loan 45 18-TR) (the "Cash
        Transfer" project); Disaster addressed: TheMarmara Earthquake, August 1999,
        7.4on the Richter scale.

        The Erzincanproject contributed greatly to the rehabilitation o f that city and its
environs. The urbanhousing, consisting o f cooperative housing, government apartment
units,teachers', nurses', andmedical staff lodgings was, onthewhole, well built.Project-
financed infrastructure i s still fully functional ten years later, and the PPAR mission
observed that civil works had stood the test o ftime quite well. Only about 30 percent o f
the originally estimated number o fhousingunits were built or repaired, however, mainly
dueto corrections for inaccurate damage assessments.

        Similarly, asmaller number o f shops andoffices than expected were
reconstructed, as demandturned out to be lower. Inthe more rural neighborhoods, 2,885
barns were financed by the project and rebuilt by the beneficiaries themselves.
Disbursements lagged significantly as aresult o fproject overestimationo f the capacity of
the government to carry out the works inapost disaster context. Progress toward
development and implementationo f seismic risk prevention andmitigation measures was
less than expected, but the installationof a GPS system inthe Marmara region was
completed by November 1999 and a study to revise the ReconstructionLaw to include
aspects on disasterswas also carried out. The latter facilitated legal revisions inthe
context o fthe following project, TEFER. OED rates the overall outcome as satisfactory.
Sustainability i s rated as likely, institutional development as modest. Bank performance
and borrowerperformance are bothratedsatisfactory.

       The TEFER project assistedthe government inrestoringbasic infrastructure in
municipalities andrural areas affected by the flood and landslides by repairing structures
and facilities o f economic and social importance. Among the project's vulnerability

                                               xii

reducing investments were 13 flood protection schemes inthe West Black Sea Flood
region, and the acquisition of weather and river monitoring systems (software and
hardware). Major infrastructure achievements included the rehabilitation o f sewerage
systems, municipal andrural roads, water supply systems, and bridges.Among actions
taken to restore the local economy was the construction o f 31irrigation systems. Private
housingwas rebuilt following the Adana earthquake: 5,000 urbanhousingunitswere
constructed, and 3,13 1ruralbeneficiaries received fundingthat enabled them to complete
the reconstructiono f their houses. OED rates the overall outcome as satisfactory.
Sustainability is rated as likely, institutional development as modest.Bankperformance
and borrower performance are bothrated satisfactory.

        To help restore living conditions inthe Marmara region following the devastating
1999 earthquake, the World Bank prepared a two-stage program. In the first stage, the
Bank reallocated $267 million infunds from ongoingBank projects. The second stage
consisted o f two Bank financed projects-one for reconstruction and mitigation, and one
supporting the government's emergency cash transfer program. The reconstruction
project-the   MarmaraEarthquake Emergency Reconstruction Project, or "MEER', i s an
ongoing $737.11millionproject, o f which the Bank i s financing $505 million. It is
discussed inthe context o f this report, but is not rated. Along with MEER, the Bank
supported the government's cash transfer program for earthquake victims through the
Earthquake Emergency Recovery Loan (EERL, $252.53 million).

        The Cash Transfer project helpedthe government respond quickly and effectively
to the disaster, as distribution o frental allowances began as early as December 1999.The
fast-disbursing nature o f the loan was particularly important inthat it ensured that
displaced persons and other groups made vulnerable by the earthquake receivedadequate
assistanceparticularly during the winter months, while longer-term reconstruction efforts
got underway. It was highly advantageous that the assistancewas incash and not inkind,
given recipients' needs at the time, and interms o f the logistics o f delivering assistance to
victims quickly. The cash transfers were delivered successfully, even though there were
several constraints -highapplicant volume, time pressure, and limitedresources. OED
rates the overall outcome as satisfactory. Sustainability is rated as likely, institutional
development as substantial. Bankperformance and borrower performance are both rated
satisfactory.

        An issue commonto all three projects i s that the post-disaster assessmentprocess
was significantly flawed. All the projects that built new infi-astructure significantly
overestimated beneficiary demand for the units produced. This overestimation ledto
empty units, which inturn ledto vandalism and, insome cases, a succession o f social
problems associatedwith crime andinsecurity. It i s noteworthythat each subsequent
project built upon the lessons o f its predecessors, however.

    Among the lessons for disaster recovery suggestedby the experience o f the projects
are the following:

Bank involvement during the emergency phase can be highly beneficial. Getting cash
support to victims quickly, positively affected the economy andperhaps even affected
people's sense o f safety and security. It was a prominent first sign o f the government's
support ina time o f acute need. The promptly provided support enabled people to

                                               xiii

survive, put funds into the economy, and was reported as highly preferable to in-kind
support by beneficiaries.

Greater accuracy of damage assessments is still needed to avoid unnecessary
construction. Although there has beenprogress, and the Marmara responsehadthe most
comprehensive damage assessment o f any of the projects, moreprecise estimates o f
public andprivate infrastructurerequirements and demand would lead to significant
(financial and social) cost savings and a faster returnto normality.

Addressing the social and economic recovery aspects of emergencyprojects, although
difficult, is criticalfor the sustainability of the reconstruction investments.The Bank
has a long andpositive experience interms o f the execution o f physical components o f
projects -the physical design o f the housinginErzincan, TEFER, andMEERi s
appropriate and of good quality. The failure to create legally required social organization
necessary for upkeep and decision-making inthe housingareas causedproblems,
however. Although considerable learningtook place from one project to the next,
incorporating lessons learned from a number o f studies, and involving social scientists in
the project process, creatingthe necessary sustainable users organizations to manage
infrastructure remains an unsolved challenge.

Creating New Disaster Management Institutions takes more time than is available
under oneproject. Although it was anticipated that Bank involvement inErzincanwould
helpto prevent the recurrence o f similar damage inthe future byincreasing capacity for
hazard mitigation, such a goalproved impossible to obtain inone project cycle. As it
turns out, inTurkey institutional development took place slowly across manyyears and
several projects. Duringthe periodwhen emergency reconstructionneeds are high,
institutional development issues canbe neglected. Focus is on gettingpeople housed.
Nevertheless, through the implementation o f several projects, the idea ofpreparedness
has taken root, and become a topic o fdiscussion. Turkey's focus is moving from crisis
management to disaster preparedness.

Cash Transfer projects can make an extremely important contribution to recovery.
Gettingcash support to victims quickly, positively affected the economy andperhaps
evenaffectedpeople's sense o fsafety and security. Itwas a prominent first sign o fthe
government's support ina time o f acute need.

 1.       Respondingto EmergenciesinTurkey

OnAugust 17, 1999, Turkey lost over 17,000 citizens, and suffered an estimated $5
billiondirect economic impact from a 7.4 magnitude earthquake inits industrialcenter-
the Marmararegion. Inthe event of a similar earthquake centered on Istanbul, the risks to
the nation stagger the imagination. Not all the natural disasters that strike the country are
large scale, however. Turkey frequently experiences smaller earthquakes, flash floods
andconsequent mudslides, as well as other naturalhazards.Disasters, small andlarge,
have called for extensive assistance. Overall, Turkey is the seventh largest recipient o f
emergency humanitarianaid and the seventhhardest hit country inthe developingworld
interms ofeconomic damagesfrom disasters' (inthe period 1974-2003).2Andwith
average economic damage rising,3it becomes harder andharder to absorb the losses.

 1.1      OfTurkey's natural hazards, earthquakesaffect the mostpeople andwreak the
most economic damage. Turkey lies on the 1,400-kilometer-long Northem Anatolian
fault, which slips at a rate o f24 millimetersper year. Between 1902 and 2004, Turkey
experienced 130 earthquakes at 5.O and above on the Richter scale (15 o f which were
between 6.8 and 7.9). Intotal, these caused approximately 80,000 casualties, 54,000
injured, andheavy damageto 450,000 buildings.For the period 1974-2003, Turkey is
rankedthe fourth hardesthit country with respect to total number o f earthquake and
(earthquake-caused) tsunami disaster^.^ Because earthquakes strike areas o f varying
population density, the damage andcasualties reported from year to year are highly
variable, depending primarily on the locationo f the earthquake's epicenter. When an
earthquake hits a largeurbanarea, damages and casualties soar, as inthe case o f the 1999
Marmara earthquake. Between 1992 and 1999, earthquakesinTurkey killed some 18,000
people and caused an estimated $20 billion indamage.

1.2       Not only are earthquakes frequent, but the vulnerability o f many human
settlements i s high, especially inneighborhoods occupied by the less well-off. Self-
constructed masonry houses, where the majority o f the poor live, rarely survive
significant earthquakes. Ninety-two percent o f the country's temtory is prone to
earthquakes and 95 percent o f the population lives inthese areas. Additionally, 45
percent o fbuildings inthe four largest cities -Adana, Ankara, Istanbul, and Izmir - are
masonry houses.

Bank Support

1.3      Turkey is rankedamong the Bank's top 10borrowers for naturaldisaster
management as~istance.~Notably, Turkey is the recipient o f the largest funding package
assembled by the Bank inresponseto a natural disaster to date - $1.2 billion was
committed following the Marmara earthquake in 1999,makingTurkey the largest Bank
borrower that year.6Between 1992 and the present, the Bank has responded to six disaster
emergencies -the Erzincanearthquake, flooding and mudslidesinboth Senirkent and
Sutqiiler, flooding and landslides inthe Western Black Sea Region, an earthquake inthe
southem area o f Adana, and, finally, the devastating Marmara earthquake. These
disasters were directly addressedinthe context o f four loans. Three o fwhich are assessed
inthis report. Four loans form animportant part oftheBank's responseto these disasters.
Three o f these loans are assessed inthis report. The fourth, the Marmara Emergency
Earthquake ReconstructionProject (MEER) (L45 17-TR) i s discussed (Chapter 5) but not
assessed, as it i s still ongoing. The three assessed include:

     0   Erzincan EarthquakeRehabilitation and Reconstruction Project (L35 11-TR)
         (the "Erzincan" project);
     0   Emergency Flood and Earthquake Recovery Project (L4388-TR) (the
         "TEFER" project);
     0   Emergency Earthquake Recovery Project (L45 18-TR) (the "Cash Transfer"
         project).

BACKGROUND

2.1      OnMarch 13, 1992,Erzincancity, inNortheast Turkey experienced an
earthquake that measured 6.8 on the Richter scale, followed by an aftershock o f 6.1 on
March 15. There were about 500 fatalities from collapsed buildingsand some 700
persons were seriously injured.The central business district ofErzincan was destroyed,
andmunicipal.buildings,markets, schools, andhousingwere severely damaged. The
heaviest damage occurred inapproximately 60 buildingso f four or more stones that
collapsed, mainly along the central avenue o f Erzincan. There was extensive damage in
the surrounding rural areas as well.

2.2      A World Bankcredit for reconstruction, The ErzincanEarthquake Rehabilitation
and Reconstruction Project (L3511-TR), inthe amount o f $285 million was approved 4
months later, inJuly 1992.Parallel financing o f $190 million was providedby the
Council o f Europe. The government contributionwas $175 million. Loanproceeds were
channeled to the HousingDevelopment Administration (HDA).

2.3      Objectives. The Memorandumto the President listed the following objective:
"reconstruct essential housing, infrastructure and other facilities, and to promptly restore

economic activity inthe affected area." The loan agreement elaborated on these broad
objectives by stating that the project will "assist the Government incarrying out its 1992-
95 emergency reconstruction programfor the Erzincan region through (i)                            rehabilitation
and reconstructionof the areas affected by the earthquake, and (ii)                     development and
implementationo f seismic risk preventionand mitigationmeasures."

2.4       Two extensions of the scope of work were approved by the Board. Subsequently
addedto the list o f components were the reconstructiono fmunicipal infiastmcture and
the implementationof flood and erosion controlmeasures inSenirkent and Siitqiiler
following mudslides and floods. The project was renamed the "Disaster Rehabilitation
and Reconstruction Project."

2.5      Fundingwas made available quickly, but due to initial lack of institutional
capacity inthe project implementationunit (PIU), and the difficulties the group
                                                               '
experienced in setting up protocols with the various agencies involved in the
reconstruction, disbursement was slow - it took two years for activities to start.

2.6      Once the PIU got up to speed, and activities commenced, implementation
progressed smoothly. Infact, later, the PISJbecame well recognizedby the government
and donors as being ahighly capable emergency reconstructionunit, and was
instrumental incarrying out subsequentemergency reconstructionprojects. Housing,
bothrural and urban,was built expeditiously andto relatively highstandards.The
number o f cooperative housingunits andbarnsbuilt fell short ofthe number estimated,
however.'

THEACHIEVEMENT OFPROJECTOBJECTIVES

2.7      The project's first objective, to assist the government incarrying out its
reconstruction program, was fully achieved. The second objective, to develop and
implement seismic risk preventionandmitigation measures was only partially achieved.

Objective 1: T o assist the government in carrying out its 1992-95 emergency
reconstruction programfor the Erzincan region through rehabilitation and
reconstruction of the areas affected by the earthquake

2.8      Reconstruction went well. The project contributed greatly to the rehabilitation o f
Erzincanand its environs, especially with respect to the hospitals and public buildings.
The PPAR missionobserved that project-financedinfrastructurewas well built, and had
stood the test o f time (over 10 years hadpassed since it was built).

2.9      The urbanhousing, consisting o f cooperative housing, government apartment
units,teachers', nurses', andmedical stafflodgingsgwas, onthe whole, well built. Just
over 30 percent o fthe originally estimated number o f units o f cooperative housingwas
builtor repaired as the actual number of eligible damaged units tumed out to be smaller
thanappraised. Inthe end, it tums out that few dwellings were simplyrepaired, as people
had a strong preference for new construction following the shock.

2.10     Inruralneighborhoods, barnshadcollapsed as a result ofthe earthquake. In
response, the projectplannedto fund the reconstruction o f a total o f 4,100 storage and
cattle barns, andthe distributiono f 10,900 animals, inorder to restore some o fthe lost
capital. This was the first physical component to finish. Beneficiaries built 2,885 barns
with lumpsumpayments for construction materials. This is fewer thanthe original
estimate o f 4,100, for the same reason as the housing - inaccurate damage estimates. All
o f the barns seen by the November 2004 PPARmission were used for purposes other

7. Located inthe Housing Development Administration (HDA), inthe PrimeMinister's Office.
8. Cooperative housing: only 1,13 1units of the originally planned 3,640 were repaired or reconstructed.
Barns: only 2,885 were built, as opposedto the original target o f 4,100.
9. The project built 150 units o f nurses` lodgings, along with another 500units o f housingfor medical staff,
and 300 units o f teacher's housing, as planned. By the time o f the PPARmission, there was less need for
nurses' and medical staff lodgings, and the mission observed that this well builthousing had been
convertedto different, but related uses (e.g., laboratories).

                                                        6

 than housing livestock, with one exception. They were beingused as houses, storage
 sheds, and inone case, even a restaurant. Residents explained that the barns were not
 warm enough for the livestock, thus they hadbeen used for other purposes, or some are
 usedfor livestock inthe summer andstorage inthe winter. The project distributed 10,348
 o f the planned 10,900 animals.

 2.11     Inadditionto the shopping centers, the projectrehabilitated 512 shops, and 143
 apartments were reconstructed." The other construction works -three hospitals, public
buildings,municipal offices, anAdult EducationCenter, aHorticulture Research Center,
 a National Education Center, four municipal workshops, a Rural Affairs Building, and a
busterminal were built or repaired as plannedandto quality standards.

 2.12     Civil works and equipment underthe infrastructure components were completed
much as planned, with the exception o f 100 kilometers o froadrepairs which were
 canceled." The sugar factory chimney was repaired as planned.

Revised components:Senirkent and Siitqiiler

2.13      Inlate 1995, a first amendment inthe LoanAgreement was made. Inadditionto
extending the closing date to December 31, 1999, this amendment added the $20 million
 Senirkent Rehabilitationprogram. Though it was much smaller thanthe Erzincan
program, it was modeled after that project concept. It was designedto support recovery
from July 1995 mudslides inthe city and includedreconstruction o f essential
infrastructure, measures for flood and erosion control, hazard mitigation, and supporting
equipment." The PPARmissionobservedthat, indeed, plantationo ftrees hadtaken
place, gabion structures hadbeenbuilt, as had the flood prevention works. The latter
construction was evaluated by COEDB engineers as havingbeen built to exceed the five
hundredyear (return period) event.

2.14      In 1997 a second amendment was added to the loan, hrther extendingthe closing
date (to June 30, 2000), canceling $42 million, adding a hospital retrofitting design
component, and a $7 millionprogram for the town of Siitqiiler.

2.15      InNovember 1995, the mountainside town ofSiitqiiler inthe Western Taurus
Mountains also suffered mudslidesfrom heavy rains. The program for Siitc;iiler, a town o f
5,000, was similar to that o f Senirkent. Because the works were beginningapproximately
two years after the mudslideshadtaken place, housingreconstructionand repair needs


10. Comparing the assessedmarket rental value with the costs for the three reconstructionhepair contracts
yields a rate o f return o f 7 percent. (Erzincan ICR).There was no NPV or IRR calculated for the project
during preparatiodappraisal.
11.This was cancelled following disagreements between the Bank and the Highways Directorate on the
need for a detailed design prior to bidding, and on whether an earlier list o fbidders from another project
could be used as the short list.
12. InJuly 1995, severe rains caused disastrous mudslides inthe town o f Senirkent. 74 people died, 195
houses collapsed, the water, sewer, electricity, telecommunications, and roads networks were all severely
damaged. The three components proposed for the Senirkent Emergency Reconstruction Program(funded
through the 1995 Amendment, inmore detail were: (1) emergency works and shelter (clearing mud,
temporary repairs o f networks and houses, gabion structures, etc.); (2) reconstruction (fullreconstruction o f
previously mentioned networks, storm water drainage network, and a wastewater treatment plant [not
built]); and (3) hazard mitigation (flood controlmeasures and afforestation and erosion control activities),

                                              7

had been met and emergency repairs o f infrastructure hadbeen made. The project
covered the needed rehabilitation and reconstruction o f infrastructure and flood control
measures 20 mitigate future disasters and to restore the quality o froad access, and water,
sewerage, electricity and other services intown.

2.16     Officials reported that they had hadno problems with the infrastructure built by
the project. The wastewater treatment facility, however, hadnot beenused. Though the
ICR states that the plant was not constructed, the authorities took the OED missionto
visit a wastewater treatment facility which they described as beingconstructedwith Bank
financing  under the Erzincanloan. Officials saidthat, duringtheprojectdesignphase, the
town noted that it did not have sufficient operating fimds inits budget to cover the
expense o fmaintenance andtreatment. Subsequent to the construction o f the facility, the
municipality made a bypass, and currently the fluid i s runningoff into the creek directly,
without treatment. The PPARmission also observed that part o f the works had fallen off
the cliff on which they were built, apparently built on unstable ground.

2.17    Though the added components involving reconstruction following flooding and
mudslides in Senirkent and Siitqiiler were for the most part well executed, they extended
the loanperiodby four years, increasing supervision costs greatly inrelation to the funds
disbursed over that time period.

Objective2: The developmentand implementationof seismic risk preventionand
mitigation measures

2.18    BankinvolvementinErzincan was intendedto help prevent therecurrence o f
similar earthquake damage inthe future. To achieve this, the projectplannedto perform
several studies aimed at institutional capacity buildingfor disaster preparedness,
including separate studies on: loss-reduction, earthquake insurance industrydevelopment,
urbanvulnerability, and emergency preparedness.Inaddition, trainingwas to beprovided
for the construction industry on buildingearthquake-resistant buildings.

 2.19      While reconstruction activities were beingcarried out, the institutional
 development component received little attention. Though the earthquake hit inMarch
 1992, the institutional development activities had still not started in 1995. A first
 amendment to the project saw the addition of, among other things, a component
 providing an MIS system for the Ministryo f Public Works and Settlement (MPWS).
 Duringdiscussions for a second amendmentto the loan agreement inAugust 1997, a
 significantly abbreviated, revised institutional development component was developed
 and agreed on (see Table 1) and anew piece was added: a Geographic Positioning
 System(GPS) for the MarmaraRegionto identifythe areas o fthe highest seismic risk,
 The system is now inuse and the revised institutionaldevelopment objective was
 satisfactorily met. Also added was a component to design earthquake retrofitting plans
 for the structural systems o fhospitals located inthe provinces o f Istanbuland Izmir. The
 planswere successfully completed byBank-approved consultants, reviewedby experts at
 Bogazici University, and forwardedto the related authorities.

 2.20    Given Turkey's vulnerability to disaster, the institutional strengthening objective
 (the development and implementationof seismic risk prevention andmitigation
 measures) was highlyrelevant. A t project close this goal hadnot been attained. However,
 the ideasplantedat the time o fthe Erzincan earthquake took root duringthe course o fthe
 following 12 years, andby the time ofthe PPAR mission inNovember 2004, positive
 results were evident. Government capacity to manage disasters had increased as
 evidenced by the government's responseto subsequent disasters, andby the newly
 created emergency management agency, TEMAD, and many o fthe seismic risk
preventionandmitigation measuresthat hadbeen completed, albeit by subsequent
 emergency projects.

2.21 Consultant services. This component, coveringthe design, supervision, and
management o f the project, represents 14percent o fthe project costs. The PrU
responsible was located inthe HDA. Institutional strengthening o f the PIU and some
supporting equipment was included.


RATINGS

Outcome. The project was justified by the circumstances created by the disaster and the
need to help Turkey deal with the aftermath. The objectives were relevant to the
country's immediate needs and priorities were coordinated with the government's overall
recovery strategy. While the project failed to meet its original institutional development
objective (preparednessfor future earthquakes), the project did meet all o f its
reconstruction goals (85 percent o f the project funds), building, inter alia, quality
housing, shops andbusinesses, barns, and roads. Though it i s difficult to say how much
o fthe area's economic growth can be attributedto the Erzincanproject, the regional
economy recovered from the 10-14 percent drop following the earthquake with strong
performance in 1994 (probably due to the reconstructionactivities) and continued growth
in1996and 1997.The objectives ofthe subsequently added Senirkent andSiitqiiler


13. Thoughno campaign or training took place. This was folded into similar activities under another Bank-
financed project.

                                                 9

reconstructionprojects were substantially met, as well as the additional components o f
designing the retrofitting plans for hospitals inIzmir and Istanbul andthe installation o f a
GPS system inthe Marmaraarea. Though the project was relevant to country needs at the
time o f the disaster and substantially met its physical objectives, there were a numbero f
shortcomings, primarily inthe area o f institutional development. Efficiency was
satisfactory though hampered by initial overestimates o f fundingneededand capacity to
implement, as well by the delayed closing o f the project and subsequent addition o f small
components for other disasters. Project outcome i s rated satisfactory.

2.22      Institutional Development Impact. Institutional development goals went largely
unmet duringthe course o f the project. However, the effects of havingproposedthe
notion could be seen inthe progress made insubsequentdisaster-related projects
(discussed inthe following chapters). Without the start that the Erzincanproject gave to
several ideas o f capacity building for natural disaster mitigation, the current gains may
never have been made. Institutional development i s rated modest.

2.23      Sustainability. The sustainability o fthe project (theresilience o f future project
benefits to major project risks) can almost be rated by observation, giventhe amount o f
time that has passedsince completion. The sustainability is rated as likely.The project-
funded buildingsbuilt following the 1992 earthquake were observed to be o f good
quality. The malls are currently inuse and do not show signs o f closing. The great
majority o f the infrastructure investmentsinSenirkent and Sutquler will likely continue
to serve their functions well. The institutional development components, though not fully
carried out duringthe lifetime of the project, were eventually pickedup insome form and
implemented, such that, there is now an organization for disaster management andmany
disaster mitigation measuresbeingintroduced, including the $400 million Bank-funded
IstanbulSeismic RiskMitigationandEmergency PreparednessProject (ISMEP)
(P078359) that i s fully dedicated to disaster mitigation. Inaddition, the hospitals
retrofitting design component is also being built upon inthe ISMEPproject.


Bank Performance

2.24      The Bank responded quickly and comprehensively to the disaster, judging
borrower commitment for the physical components well. Staff spent considerable time
assisting the PIUwith procedural issues such as hiring design and supervision consultants
andthe preparationofbiddingdocuments, and Bank procedures. Importantly, World
BankResidentMission staffplayed a large and critical role inthe smooth operation of
the project. As i s common, project focus leanedtoward the physical construction
activities, as notedby a QAGreport. Little attention was paidto reestablishing economic
activity. Onbalance, however, Bank performance i s rated as satisfactory.

Borrower Performance            ,

2.25      Borrower performance i s rated satisfactory. The PIU's performance is assessed
as satisfactorybecause, though it faced a number o f challenges from the beginning, it
managed to successfully create protocols needed to work well with a multitude o f
agencies, and developed the capacity to effectively coordinate the project activities. The

                                                  10

government was in full support o f the construction and infrastructure components,
whereas there was less support for mitigation components.



3.       The TEFER Project

BACKGROUND

3.1      OnMay 21, 1998, inTurkey's WesternBlack Sea Region(WBSR), an area of
about 37,000 square kilometers with apopulation o f 2.2 millionwas affectedby flooding
that i s estimated to occur only once every 200 years inthis region. The flooding was
                                                                             l4
accompanied by several hundredlandslides lasting for several weeks thereafter. More
than 150rivers over-ran their embankments, and 478 settlements were left wholly or
partially under water. The flood damagedprivate houses, public buildings (including
schools, hospitals and housing), rural and urbaninfrastructure, telecommunication and
energytransmission systems anddestroyed crops and livestock. Total damage was
estimated at about $500million. Inresponseto a government request for assistance, the
Bankbeganpreparation ofanemergency flood project.

3.2      Duringproject preparation, on June 27, 1998, a major earthquake struck southern
Turkey. Around 150people died inAdana Province and over 1,000 people were injured,
Over 74,000 housingunits sufferedcollapse or damage, with total damage estimated in
the range of$1billion." As aresult, the Bank agreedwith the Government ofTurkey
(GOT) to include emergency earthquakeresponse and recovery assistance under the
flood project, ina $685 million multi-sectoral project, with a loan amount o f $369
million.

3.3      As the project was beinglaunched, Turkey experienced yet another earthquake,
one o f its most devastating, inthe Marmararegiono f Western Turkey with its epicenter
approximately 55 miles southeast o f Istanbul. Inresponse to this disaster, the GOT and
the Bank agreedto amendthe project's loan agreement to cover emergency construction
needs for Marmara. Under this amendment o f September 1999, $62.5 million was
reallocated-about 17percent ofthe original loan amount - for housing constructionin
the area affected by the Marmara earthquake, as well as to provide technical assistance to
the government to prepare the launchof the Turkish Catastrophic InsurancePool.

Objectives. The objectives o fthe project were to assist the GOT in: (a) restoringbasic
infrastructure inmunicipalities andrural areas affected by the flood by repairing
structures and facilities o f economic and social importance; (b) providing assistance to
restore housing inthe earthquake affected Province o f Adana; and (c) reducing
vulnerability to future floods and earthquakes.

THEACHIEVEMENT OFPROJECTOBJECTIVES

3.4      The first andthirdobjectives (restoring infrastructureandreconstructinghousing)
were substantially achieved. However, the second objective, involving vulnerability
reduction, was only partially achieved duringthe lifetime o fthe project, as the Marmara
earthquake hit as the TEFER project was beinglaunched. Realizingthe need for larger
improvements invulnerability reduction, the goals o f the objective were modified and
implemented instead under a subsequent emergency project, MEER.

Objective 1:Assist the government in restoring basic infrastructure in
municipalities and rural areas affected by the flood by repairing structures and
facilities of economic and social importance

This objective was fully achieved. Through the municipal andrural infrastructure
rehabilitationcomponent (31percent o f the appraised project cost) the project succeeded
incompletingthe repair ofthe wastewater andwater supplynetworks, roads, andbridges
inDevrek, Yenice, andKarabukdamagedbythe floodwere all completed. Itwas
decided that works necessary inBartinwere more extensive than originally thought, so
that municipality's repairs were subsequently subsumed inthe MEERproject. The
success i s particularly noteworthy given the large number o fboth minor civil works and
NCB contracts, Major infrastructure achievements includedthe
rehabilitationheconstruction of 10 sewerage systems; 1,446 km o fmunicipal and rural
roads; and 165 water supply systems, 31irrigation systems, and 93 bridges.

                                                 12

Objective2: Assist the governmentin reducingvulnerabilityto future floods and
earthquakes

3.5      Flood management and hazard risk reduction efforts got off to a slow start, and
were only partially achieved by project close. The FloodManagement and Hazard
Reductioncomponent (23 percent o ftotal appraised project cost) involved flood and
landsliderisk reduction and mitigation, modernizationofthe monitoring, forecasting, and
warningsystems, improvement o f disaster response capabilities, andthe repair and
improvement o f flood protection infrastructure. Energywas focused on the
implementation o f the physical components, while the forward-lookingmitigation
component was largely ignored. Among the project's vulnerability reducingphysical
investmentswere 13 flood protectionschemesinWest Black SeaFloodRegion, andthe
acquisition o fweather and river monitoring systems (software andhardware). Both
aspects were completed successfully. When the Marmara earthquake struck, however, the
institutional aspects o f the project's vulnerability reduction activities still hadnot gotten
o f fthe ground, save the disaster insurance study, and were incorporated into the MEER
project.

3.6      The OED mission observed some shortcomings on the ground. For instance, in
the municipality o f Devrek, properlybuilt downstream flood protection works were
observed, but the precise area upstreamwhere blockage had caused the river to flood the
town inthe first place was left untouched. Additionally, upstream, the mission observed
that debrisremoval had not beenperformed along the riverbanks, andthat debris will
inevitably enter the river, reducing the causeway and increasing the risk o f the river's
flooding unless it i s moved. The municipality does not have the equipment or the funding
to remove it.16While these difficulties are due inpart to contractor financial collapse and
a supervisory failure to grasp the implications, it i s indicative o f the difficulties in
coordinatingthe work o f different ministries. The mission understands that the
government will address the oversight this year.

3.7     The housing reconstruction component was the largest o f the four, makingup 45
percent o f the loan. It involved demolition and emergency housingreconstruction in
Adana and Cehan. Private housing rebuilt included: 5,000 urbanhousingunits, o f which
2,600 were allocated to earthquake victims, and the remainder were either allocated to
other agencies or held inreserve pendingcourt cases concerning eligibility; and 3,13 1
rural beneficiaries received fundingthat enabled them to complete the reconstructiono f
their houses.

3.8     The PPAR mission observed multiple complexes o fwell-built urbanhousing, as
well as high-quality rural housing. An independently performedbeneficiary survey o f
299 TEFER housingproject beneficiaries conducted inpreparationfor the constructiono f

MEERproject housingdetermined that the majorityofthe residents are satisfied with
their houses."

 3.9      The option o frebuilding insituwas considered, and implementedinCehan,
where 1,000 units were constructed on their original site to reduce the cost o f site
development. The ideawas considered inAdana, but the PAD notes that doing so with
multi-familyhousingreconstructionwould beproblematic becauseonly aportionofthe
inhabitants of a given buildingmight have beeneligible for disaster relief. The selected
 site inAdana was previously considered for another Bankproject and much work was
completedtowards preparation. The notion o f rebuildinginsituwas found feasible for
 single-family units inthe rural reconstruction component, however.

3.10     Assessment o f the need for housingproveddifficult, as i s common inan
emergency situation. Though the project design significantly cut the officially assessed
requirednumber of units, and only 14percent o f those needed as reported by the
assessmentwere built, the number o f unitsbuilt was still nearly double the amount
requiredto meetbeneficiary needs.'' Furthermore, anumber o f factors exacerbatethe
problem. Low uptake can be partially attributed to construction timing andbeneficiary
patience-the     ability and willingness to wait for a unit as well as their acceptance o f the
location o fthe housing. Also, inthis region, rents are sometimes paidup to two years in
advance, meaning that some of the beneficiaries had already committedto a lease
elsewhere and could not move in.Still others were reported to live elsewhere and rent out
their unit for the extra income (see Housing-Urban             and Rural inPart 11).

3.11     The PPARmissionobserved the consequences o f overbuilding. Blocks o f
unoccupiedunits hadbeenvandalized -windows were broken and doors were removed,
exposing the interiors to the elements, and units were stripped o f all fixtures, hinges,
outlets, counters, sinks, etc. Insuch a state, the physical decay o f the units will be
accelerated and makingthem owner-ready once againwill take a significant investment.
Social dynamics are affected as well. The damaged units, too, can quickly leadto a
lessened attractiveness of the complex as a whole. Not surprisingly, the units are subject
to the ongoing predations o f criminals andbarbed wire stockades have been erected
around the more densely populated zones o fthe housing area.

3.12     Also lackingwas a (legally required) management structure for maintenance o f
the commons -heating, public lighting, grounds, andrepairs. Inthe Cehanhousing
complex, where this issue was particularly evident, a highlocal government official
assured the OED mission that he would start the organizationo f a community
management structure by beginning to collect funds for improvements (essentially acting
on behalf o f condominium associations that the municipality would set up) while setting
up the structure, andthen handingit over to the condominium associationswhenthey
were up andrunning.The previouslymentionedbeneficiary survey concluded that the
lack o f associations may have beenbecauseo fbeneficiary mistrusto ftheir unknown

neighbors. The study suggestedthat lettingthe beneficiaries organize their own groupings
when assigning housingwould bemore conducive to creating trust.

3.13     For the rural housingcomponent, families chose from architectural designs and
thencontracted the construction ofthem (or builtthembythemselves). The PPAR
mission observed extremely sturdyrural housinginKiirkguler. The dimensions o f the
steel-reinforced concrete columns and beams indicated that these houses could likely
survivethe 500-year earthquake. Families received finding ininstallments, dependingon
the completion of a buildingphase- one installment came after excavation, others after
the completiono fthe foundation, construction works, and finishingwork.

RATINGS

3.14     Outcome. The project objectives were highlyrelevant to the needs o f the disaster-
affected country. The physical aspects (the bulk o fthe project) were aclzleved to a great
extent duringthe life o f the project, and some aspects o f the housing component were
later even improved usingfundingfrom MEERproject. The institutional goals were not
met duringthe life o fthe project, but did live on inthe MEERproject, and influencethe
design o f that project. Overall, the project i s rated satisfactory.

3.15    InstitutionalDevelopment Impact. The PPAR missionobserved that the
institutional capacity development initiatedduring the TEFER project has subsequently
taken hold. Although little headway was made duringthe life o f the project (largely
becausethe Marmara earthquake hit andproject ID goals were rethought, expanded, and
transferred to the still ongoing MEERproject) the project had an impact beyond its
scheduled years o f implementation. The missionobserved progress inthe Meteorological
department. The institutional development impact o fthe project i s rated modest.

3.16    Sustainability. Giventhe short amount o ftime since project close, it is difficult to
rate project sustainability. However, the missionnotedthat roads and flood infrastructure
were beingmaintained by the respective agencies, apositive sign. Some units inAdana
and Cehan were vacant, but project infrastructure was built to last, and the shortcomings
(lack o fparking, amenities, and a health center) were being addressed by the MEER
project, along with the bulk o f the institutionaldevelopment component. The weather
forecasting achievements are expected to be sustainable. Project-built systems are under
normal operation andthe State Hydraulic Works (DSI) i s fully committed. Project
sustainability i s ratedlikely.

BankPerformance

3.17    The Bank responded quickly after the 1998,flooding, mudslides, and earthquake,
once again playing an organizingrole. Like for the MEERproject, the appraisal mission
was staffed by some o f the Bank's foremost disaster experts, who were able to deal with
not only one, but several disasters, incorporatingthem into project plans. The team
brought to the response andrecovery program an organizational fiamework anda clear

process for identifying, selecting, and implementingpriority infrastructure and flood
management investments Bank performance is rated satisfactory.

Borrower Performance

 3.18     Onthe ground, some o fthe implementingagencies lacked sufficient
communication with one another, which affected project implementation, as inthe
Devrek example. Onbalance, however, borrower performance i s rated satisfactory.As
has generally been the case inthe emergency projects inthis cluster PPAR, the borrower
worked closelywith the Bank's project team, and difficulties that arose were attended to
 swiftly. The PIU, havinghad experience inemergency projects (Erzincan) provedhighly
capable. The group always went the extra mileto meet demandingconstruction
schedules, and proactively deal with implementationissues.



4.        The Cash Transfer Project

4.1       OnAugust 17, 1999, a 7.4 magnitude earthquake devastatedthe Marmara region
o f Turkey -the country's industrial heartland. Areas o fpeak damage included the seven
provinces o fKocaeli (Izmit, Golquk), Sakarya (Adapazari), Yalova, Bolu, Istanbul,
Bursa, and Eskisehir. Over 17,000 lives were lost, an estimated 200,000 people were
made homeless inthe region, and Turkey's industrial center was extensively damaged. 23
percent o f the country's population lives inthis area that produces 34.7 percent o f
Turkey's GNP.

4.2       Thepoor, who generally live instructurally weaker housingstock, were
particularly vulnerable. Adding to this vulnerability was the fact that their primejob
market -the self-employed, small, and micro-enterprise sectors -was the hardest hit by
the earthquake. About 20,000 small businesses were destroyed, leaving about 140,000
people without jobs.20The earthquake pointedout the need for upgradingthe existing
emergency response system, the lack of effective enforcement o f Turkey's building
codes, and the inadequate coverage o f earthquake insurance inthe housing sector.

4.3      At the government's request, the Bankprepared a two-stage program. Inthe first
stage, it immediately approved separate amendments to eight existing loans, reallocating
$267 million infunds from ongoing Bankprojects toward emergency reliefand
reconstruction.2'The second stage o f the assistance program consisted o f a reconstruction
project that includedpreventionand mitigation components (MEER, $737.1 1million
project cost, $505 millionofwhich was Bank-financed), and an ERL supporting the
government's cashtransfer program for earthquake victims (EEFU,, $252.53 million).

 MEERis not one of the projects beingassessed, as it is still ongoing. It is examined inthe
 next chapter, however, to inform the larger analysis found inPart I1o f this report, as it
 forms the major part o f the Bank's experience with disasters inTurkey.

 4.4     The Cash Transfer project, a $252.53 million emergency recovery loan (ERL),
 helped the government respond expeditiously to the Marmara earthquake emergency by
 providing up-front cash assistanceto earthquake victims for accommodationassistance
 (75 percent o f total benefits), repair assistance(13.4 percent), death and disability
benefits (10 percent), and death benefit, survivor, and disability pensions (1.5 percent),
 Business owners received a lump sumpayment o f between $340 and $855 (US.
 equivalent) for damages following the disaster. Victims not living intemporary housing
received $170 per month for 18 months as rent assistance.

4.5      Providing immediate cash assistance for victims meant that they couldpurchase         ,
their own supplies, shelter, etc. rather thanreceive items inkindwhichmightnot have
been appropriate. From a social standpoint, the project gave hope andreassuranceto the
 affected population ina time o f desperate need, a tangible sign o f the government's
efforts to help the victims, affecting not only their material status, but also their
psychological well being. InGujarat, India, earthquake victim's need for this sort o f cash
assistancebecame apparent to the Bankinan indirect way following the 2001
earthquake. Families were usingthe first installment o f house construction funding to
purchase food and other necessities to survive, rather thanusingit toward the
construction. As a result, when it was time to issue the second installment, many o fthe
families didnot have the first phase o f the house to show inorder to receive the second
installment.

THEACHIEVEMENTOFPROJECTOBJECTIVES

4.6      The three project objectives identifiedby the Memorandum and Recommendation
of the President (MOP) were fully achieved as follows.


Objective 1: Help the government respond quickly and effectively to the disaster

4.7     Duringaperiodo fchaos andlack o finformation, the Cash Transferprogram
helped the government respond quickly to the August 17, 1999 catastrophe -The project
was appraised on October 10, 1999, approved by the Board on November 11, 1999, and
made effective on December 14, 1999. The fast-disbursing nature o f the loanwas
particularly important to project success. Disbursements were made against allowances
paid, and support for expenditures was rapid: 41 percent o f total project funds hadbeen
disbursedbythe end o fDecember 1999,60 percent bythe end o fJanuary, and 80 percent
bythe end ofMarch, 2000.22

4.8     The process went smoothly. The cash transfers were administered through
existinginstitutionsthat had an established system for administering cash transfers.
Ninety-eightpercent o fthe transfers were administered through Turkey's social


22. The closing date was extended by three months to permit the completion o fanalyses and
recommendations for how the GOT can improve its capacity to respond to future catastrophes.

protection agency, the Social Solidarity Fund(SSF), which had over 900 offices, and
extensive experience with normal social protectionpayment distribution. The benefits
were deliveredsuccessfully, especially given the constraints -highapplicant volume,
time pressure, and limitedresources.


Objective2: Ensurethat displacedpersons and other groups madevulnerableby
the earthquakereceivedadequateassistanceparticularlyduringthe winter months,
while longer-termreconstructionefforts got underway23

4.9       This objectivewas achieved through the provisiono f cash support for five priority
programs under the government's earthquake recovery program supported by the cash
transfer project - accommodation assistance; repairs assistance; death and disability
benefits; workplace social allowances; and death benefits, survivor, and disability
pensions. The programprovided quick cash to people who neededthe help immediately,
and to survive the winter.

4.10      The accommodation assistanceprogram.This program, administered by the SSF,
was for families whose dwellings had collapsed or had suffered heavy or medium
damage. Called "rent support" incommon usage, it provided families with 100 million
TL (around US$170) per month, for 18 months. Displacedfamilies were able to choose
between the cash assistance or free accommodation inpublic facilities or pre-fabricated
housing. An independent evaluation reportedthat by the end o fMarch 2000, when 80
percent o fproject funds hadbeen disbursed, accommodation assistanceamountedto
$98,344,606, or 39.0 percent o fproject funds. Seventy-five percent ofproject funds were
targeted for this component. Bycompletion, 75.2 percent hadbeenallocated toward it.
Though some families were incorrectlygiven accommodation and repair allowances, the
government promptly analyzed and corrected the situation.

4.11      The repairs assistanceprogram. This program, also administered by the SSF,
provided a lump sum o f 600 million TL (around $1,025) for families inthe affected
regionwhose dwellings had sufferedlight damage. As planned, this component
accounted for 13.4percent o fproject funds.

4.12      Lump-sum death and disability benefits. These benefits were paid to all families
that had suffered a death or disability. The death allowance provided financial support o f
a lump sum 750 million T L (around $1,280), and the disability allowance provided those
with a first degree (80 percent) disability with a lump sum o f 500 million TL (around
$855) andthose with a second degree (60 percent) disability 300 million TL (around
$5 15). This program was also administered bythe SSF. Like the previous component, the
amount plannedinproject design was indeed allocated - 10percent.

4.13      Workplace social allowances. These were providedto those who, at the time o f
the earthquake, activelyuseda workplace (that hadbeendestroyed) to earn their living,
whether they were tenants or workplace owners. These people received a lump sum
between 500 millionTL (around $855) and 200 million TL (around $340), depending on
the amount o f damagethe workplace had suffered.

23. This is the objective stated inthe Memorandum o f the President. Inthe ICR the objective is stated
differently: "Help ensure that payments are made to all.eligible beneficiaries" (ICRp 5).

                                                    18

4.14     The lump sums were not enough to get businessesback on their feet again,
according to one person working on the project. While citizens affected by the disaster
receivedmonthly payments for rental allowance, business owners received the one,
relatively small, lump sum. More support to businesses might have helpedthe funds work
toward generating livelihoods, thereby spurring economic recovery.

4.15     Death bene$ts, survivor, and disability pensions. One and a halfpercent o f the
funds went towardthese benefits that were administered by ES (Retirement Fund-for
government and white collar workers), SSK (Social Security Fund-workers), and BK
(fund for self-employedpersons). Inthe end, 1.5 percent ofproject funds was allocated
toward this component, as planned.

4.16     The funds were distributedfor one year, andthe government extended the rental
allowances for an additional six months (the extensions were not covered by loan
financing). One official involved inthe project noted that becausethere was no clear
informationon the duration ofpayments, beneficiaries found it difficult to make
informedresource allocation decisions. And further, that cash transfer, when
administered over a longtime period, runs the risk o f creating dependency. As well, it
was arguedthat the fbnds might be more effectively investedinmore permanent
solutions, such as creatingindustryandjobs to provide people with opportunities to make
the money themselves. The suggestion was made that perhaps limitingthe number o f
months o f support would be less likely to cause dependency issues.

4.17     Inanindependent beneficiary assessment, 85 percent o ftherespondents were
satisfied with the approach o f the officials administering the programs.24This assessment,
performedby IstanbulUniversity, investigated how people were coping with the
aftermath o f the earthquake and how successful the allowances andbenefits were in
reachingtheir intendedtarget populations. 25 The assessment also reported that there were
no complaints about people's ability to obtain their benefits under the project. The
beneficiary assessment was one o f two independent assessmentsprovided for by project
plans.The other, an operational review performedbyPriceWaterhouse, examined, first,
the adequacy ofprocedures andsystemsused inprojectimplementationand, second, the
efficiency and effectiveness o f the results. The primaryconcem outlined by this
document was a lack o f central direction for standard approval and distribution controls
o f the administering institutions, as well as their lack o f a centralizedinformation
database. The review also points to a needfor "advance emergency planning with well
defined procedures andresponsibilities for appropriateinstitutions." These issues are
beingtaken up ina follow-on project-the            $500 million SocialRisk Mitigation Project
(SRMP) (U638-TR).The institutionalstrengthening component o fthat loanwill include
the implementationo fthe key agreed recommendations o f the operational review, inter
alia, requiring formal financial reporting arrangements o f the SSF, andthe development
and implementationo f an integratedMIS.

reached.

4.18     Though the Price Waterhouse report observed some weaknesses inthe programs,
it stresses that the assessmento f effectiveness o f the programmust be taken inthe
context o f local conditions, post-disaster-claims processorswere themselves disaster
victims and working under difficult conditions, and many documents were unavailable
becausethey hadbeenlost inthe earthquake when administrative buildingscollapsed.
Regarding the latter, it was impossible to access individuals' income data neededto
determine eligibility as the public buildings containing such records were largely
destroyed. This point has beentaken up by the recently approved ISMEP project, which
within one component attendsto the "retrofitting/reconstruction o fpriority public
facilities such as hospitals, clinics, schools, administrative buildings and infrastructure."

Objective3: Assist inkeepingTurkey's reformprogramon track

4.19     1999 was a difficult year for Turkey. Largely due to highinterest rates (exceeding
 100percent), the economy was ina deep recession with output declining by over 4
percent and inflationover 60 percent. The Marmara earthquake contributed significantly
to the economic costs seen inthe downturn. To help the economy out o f its recession, a
drop inreal interest rates was necessary. The Turkish government launched a
comprehensive economic reform program in 1999 to achieve this drop. The government
pushedthrough many economic and institutionalreformsby the endo f 1999, despite two
earthquakes, adding to the success o f the economic reform program. These changes,
combined with the earthquake recoveryprocess and reconstruction is believedto have
contributed to a sharp economic upturninlate 1999 and early 2000. Interest rates in
treasury bills dropped from over 110percent inNovember to 35-40 percent inJanuary.
Theprovision o f funds from IFIs such as the Bank andthe IMF, and other bilateral and
multilateralsources (of which the Cash Transfer project can be seen as a part, infusing
$252.53 million into the economy ina time of great need) was one o fthree important,
interlinkedfactors designated to bringabout the reductioninrealinterest rates.The
infusion o f funds throughthe Cash Transfer project likelymitigatedthe immediate
impact o f the earthquake, to some extent.

RATINGS

4.20     Outcome. The outcome i s rated satisfactory.The cashtransfer project provided a
swift solution to the immediate problem byproviding cash benefits to the affected
population. This innovative approach to immediate disaster assistanceproved successful
whenpairedwith a strong and carefully thought out reconstructionandmitigationplan
(MEER). Bankidentificationo fthe projectwas rapid, as requiredinthis emergency
situation, and this Bank-supported program represented the first, very important
assistancemade to victims. The fast-disbursing nature o f the loan (disbursementswere
made against allowances paid) was key inachieving such a rapid response. The
additional objective o f improvingthe capacity o f Turkish institutions to respond to
emergencies happened inthe course o f implementation. With respect to efficiency, no
ERRSor IRRs were calculated as it was an emergency operation. However, more support
for business owners may have shown higher economic returns on the investment, given
that this move could have generatedjobs and economic activity. Administration o f the
project was efficient. Though there were a numbero f instances o fpeople receiving

                                                    20

multiplebenefits, such cases were relatively few. The funds servedto stimulatethe
economy at a critical time, thus aiding the economic recovery o f the country.

4.21 Institutional Development Impact. The institutional development impact o fthis
project i s rated substantial. Though the project didnot have any stated institutional
goals, duringimplementation, a new objective arose26-to improve the capacity o f
Turkish institutions, especially the SSF, to respond infuture emergency situations. The
agencies have hadvaluable experience inthe administrationo f such a program, including
setting up additional field offices, coordinating volunteers, and effectively delivering
benefits inthe context o f an emergency.

4.22      This on the ground experience, combined with the inputfromtwo institutional
 assessment^,'^ provides a base from which to move forward on capacity building.This
base will be further developed inthe ongoing follow-on project, the Social Risk
Mitigation project (L4638-TR) ($500 million), which i s a socialprotection project,
developed with the SSF as implementingagency.

4.23      Sustuinability. The sustainability o fthis project is rated likely. The gains in
experience with emergency cash transfer operations, will be supported and improved
upon by the follow-on Social Risk Mitigationproject. The temporary paymentsmade to
earthquake victims have helpedmove the beneficiaries into permanent living situations,
producing sustainable benefits inthat sense. The fact that thesystem relied heavily on
volunteer help exposes a potentialweakness indealingwith fbture disasters. Without
such support, the result might not have been as positive.


Bank Performance

4.24     The Bank performance is rated as satisfactory. Bank performance was both
innovative and well thought out. Project documents outlined the project, inpart, as a
traditional balance o fpayments loan, with apositive list o f imports, etc., when inreality
it was a pioneeringdeparture from suchlending.


Borrower Performance

4.25     The borrowerperformance i s rated satisfactory. The implementingagencies (SSF
and the social insurance agencies [Bag-Kur, SSK, ES]) quickly set up additional field
offices, effectively processed applications and administered benefits under very difficult
circumstances.

    5.1     The MarmaraEmergency Earthquake Framework Program is a multi-donor effort
    with a total program cost of$1,795.75 million. The World Bankandthe European
    InvestmentBank financed the bulk of the works, which are beingimplemented usinga
    shared PIU(the same one used for Erzincanand TEFER). At $505 million, the ongoing
    MEERproject forms the largestpiece inthe Bank's $1.2 billionresponseto the
    catastrophe (see following box for an outline ofproject components). The project has
    disbursed about $219.5 million andthe undisbursedamount is about $285.5 million, o f

   5.2     The MEERproject had several objectives. The first objective was to help restore
*  the living conditions inthe earthquake-affected region. The project was to produce
    10,000 new homes, and fimds from a previous emergency project, TEFER, would finance
   an additional2,600 inAdapazari. This represented about 30 percent o f the numbero f
   collapsed, heavily damaged, andmediumdamaged units inurbanareas defined as
   uninhabitableunits. Includedinurbanhousingcomplexes were schools, health centers,
   andcommon areas (as well as the shops andbusinessescomplexes discussed later).

   5.3     Bythe endofFY2002, the construction ofapproximately 12,000 housingunits
   was completed, along with cofinancier-funded off-site infrastructure, and additional
   landscaping works were finalized. The MEERproject also financed some work at
   housing sites inAdana and Cehan, carried over from the TEFER project. The OED
   mission observed that the housingwas well-built, residents had independentlyplanted
   amenity gardensto beautify their housingcomplexes, and sports facilities such as
   basketball courts and playgrounds hadbeen installed. The PPAR missionunderstood



   28. The MEERproject i s not included as one o f the projects being assessed by this PPAR. The following
   examination of the project informs the analysis inPart I1o fthis report.

from interviews with residentsthat they appreciated the Bank-funded housingbecause
they perceived it to be safe and of good construction quality.

5.4      While the physical construction of the housing component went smoothly, the
project encountered difficulties when confronted with the less tangible aspects o f the
endeavor, such as the creation of cooperative maintenance organizations inthe housing
areas. InTurkey, maintenance o fthe commons i s usually taken care o fby cooperative
associations o f the inhabitants, yet this type of organization was not evident inthe Bank-
fundedsites. The TEFERhousingbeneficiary surveymentionedinthe last chapter
concludes that this effect could be due to not preserving existing neighborhoodgroupings
and other social relationships inplacingthe occupants intheir new buildings- the new
residents had a low level of comfort with one another.           *'
5.5      The number ofunitshandedover to the beneficiaries closely follows the number
o fhousingunits constructed, according to the most recent figures provided by the PIU.30
The number o f units actually occupied i s lower than that handedover, however.31
Moreover, those occupied are not all occupied by the beneficiaries (many beneficiaries
are rentingout their units).Inall o f the project sites there i s a relatively high general
occupancy rate except one -Hereke.

5.6      With only 30 percent overall occupancy 3 years after completion, Hereke suffers
from vandalism andneglect. The mission observed brokenwindows, damaged units, and
cows grazing inthe common areas. The lower occupancy rates were explained by a
number o f factors. The site, while it`commands a stunningview o fthe Marmara Sea, i s
30 kilometers from the nearest center o fwork. And the roads department (KGM) only
recently finished the access road (August 2004). Loweringthe demand even further, the
MinistryofPublic Works and Settlement (MPWS), also responsible for buildinghousing
for earthquake victims, built 500 extra units closer to town following public complaints
that the Hereke site was too isolated. Also, by the time the Hereke housing was finished,
few beneficiaries remained and several o fthe units were offeredto beneficiaries from
other districts or from rural areas, but most declined.

5.7      Beneficiary-constructed rural housingreconstructionwas undertaken through a
$22.92 million sub-component consisting o fbuildinghouses inrural areas o f the Yalova
andKocaeli provinces that started inSeptember 2000 and completed by August 2001.
Out o f 1,377 eligible beneficiaries, 796 participated. Interms o f the size o f the buildings
constructed, 65 percent built 90-110 square meter houses, 25 percent built 75 square
meterhouses (the paymentbasedsize ofthe program), and9 percentbuilt 60 square
meterhouses.Duringfield visits, it appearedthat this rangewas typical o fthe size of
houses inthe area. Beneficiaries, under the supervision o f consultants, undertook, or
contracted out construction o f seismic-resistant buildings. Inso doing, the beneficiaries

was enforced.

5.8       Payments to beneficiaries were made inincrements, basedon a successful
approach usedinprevious emergency projects-Erzincan                   andTEFER-with the first
payment made only after evidence o f clear title to the landwas provided. Remaining
payments were made inpre-agreed stages. Inthe case o f the rural housing, each family
received 6 billion TL (2001) to                   The OED mission observed seismic-resistant,
safe buildings, designedto accommodate expansions.

5.9        Givenonly 58 percent o fthe eligible beneficiaries actuallyparticipated, the PIU
contracted a six-month study, completed inDecember 2003. The study suggests ways to
increase beneficiary acceptance infuture rural housingprojects, including:

     0    Take into account the education level ofthe beneficiaries whenpromotingthe
          program. Many of them may not be familiar with bankingor credit systems.
           Simple, clear communication at all levels (promotion, information, contracts, etc.)

          groups, such as the elderly (who were less likely to participate inthe self-
          construction or sub-contracting than other groups).

     0    Consider building types more commonto the local rural areas.

     0    Ifthey addressthesametarget group, combine theruralandurbanhousing
          components. Becausethe rural project area was close to the urbanhousing built in
          the MEER project, potentialrural housingbeneficiarieswere consideringboth
          options. Linkingthe two under one multi-dimensionalprogram could bemore
          effective.

5.10      The business rehabilitation component of the framework program, modeled after
the Erzincanproject experience (though not Bank-funded), had the potentialto support
the secondMEERproject objective: economic recovery and growth. The project
provided a sub-component for credit financing of small scale shopping malls.33
Shopkeepersand other business peoplewere organized into cooperatives which were the
recipients o f the financing.34

5.1 1 The OED mission observed 14business centers o f varying sizes. The buildings
built were two-story free-standingmalls situated within the housing sites created inthe
MEERhousingcomponent. The layout was suchthat shops on the bottom floor faced
outward, toward a number o fparkingspaces, and could also insome instances be
accessed from a corridor running down the middle on the inside.



32. The figure was determined by MPWS.
33. Provided ifrequested by mayors of stricken cities.
34. T h ~ sub-component represented roughly half o f the business rehabilitation component. The other
          s
portion went primarily toward asset replacement assistance.

                                              24

5.12    Most o f the malls were less than half full and several were completely empty.
Some o f the unoccupied centers hadbeenvandalized. One shop manager (who rented
from the original beneficiary) explained that the few shops there were strugglingbecause
the potential customers livingnearby were accustomed to shopping inthe city center. She
commented that the new shops were built far from where the beneficiary shopowners
shops had originally been located. Consequently, manydeclined to take on the units. In
three locations where tenants for the shops and businesses were absent, it was anticipated
that a nearby university would take over part o f the empty centers. A shop manager
interviewedby the OED missionwas eager for the universityto take over a nearby
(project funded) complex o f shops andbusinesses that was empty and abandoned, hoping
for increased business from the students.

5.13    The thirdobjective ofthe MEERproject was to develop an institutional
framework for disaster riskmanagement and mitigation. The Disaster Response System
andRiskMitigation component ($419.16 million appraised value, intotal) was designed
to helpmeet objective number three. It includes the National EmergencyManagement
system, the disaster insurance scheme, landuseplanningand constructioncodes, and
cadastre renovation and landmanagement sub-components. Progress on this component
hasbeenuneven.

5.14    National emergency managementsystem ($110.17 million). This sub-component
includes: (1) the creation o f a new national emergency management agency, (2)
realignment o f responsibilities among ministries and general directorates, and (3)
decentralization o f authority and enhancement o f emergency management capabilities at
the municipal andprovincial levels. Itemnumber one, the TurkishEmergency
Management Agency, TEMAD, was indeedcreated, but progress on forging political will
to implement the component hadbeen slow-going.

5.15    Since a low point when the component was nearlycancelled, the group has been
showing significant signs o fprogress. TEMAD has initiated substantive discussions with
other key organizations, including the General Directorateo f Civil Defense (Ministryo f
the Interior) andthe GeneralDirectorate ofDisaster Affairs (Ministryo fPublic Works
andSettlement), about operational andinstitutional arrangements. TEMAD is about to
beginconstructiono f a new, permanent, emergency management facility, new national
emergency communications system, and an emergency management information system.
The agency has also shown operational promise by aidingneighboringcountries
following disasters, andconducting multi-nation risk simulation activities. These signs,
combined with the initiatives proposed inISMEP, point to the continuedprogress and
sustainability of this component.

5.16   Disaster insurance ($273.00 million). Inorder to extend liquidityto homeowners,
reduce government liability, and lessendependence on foreign donors inthe event o f
future disasters, the disaster insurance scheme was launched in September 2000. The
scheme, which will cover $1billionindamages inthe event o f a disaster, got off the
ground ina timely fashion, and had soon more than tripledthe level o f insurance
penetration for earthquake coverage35compared to that achievedby the private insurance
marketbefore the introductiono fthe scheme. It also demonstrated its ability to pay

                                                          25

 claims quickly ina number o f small- andmedium-sizedearthquakes that have occurred
 since its initiation. A successfulpublic awareness campaign, combined with an affordable
 average annual premiumo f $20 brought the scheme significant penetration initially (the
 average is currently $46), andthe levelhas heldsteady at around 2 million policies over
 the past three and a half years.36Ifthe draft Earthquake Insurance Law is passed, it could
 increasepenetration hrther, but so far this has not happened. In addition the Bank team i s
 currently investigatingseveral measuresto increase the number of policy holders. To
 enable the scheme to use more (of the less costly) Bank financing inits cover, the Bank
 and TCIP agreed on an increase o fthe existing$100million contingent capital facility by
 $80 million.

 5.17      Despiteinitial success, the scheme faces some difficulties innot only sustaining,
 but increasing the numbersofinsuredinthe country. Two newly enacted lawspertaining
 to state-owned enterprises, the Public Financingand SupervisionLaw and the
 Procurement Law for State-Owned Enterprises, may terminate the insurance program's
 current exemption from all state regulations applying to government-owned enterprises
 (It was created as a special, non-government entity, as it does not have government
 employees, and the government only intervenes inthe highlyunlikely event o f a disaster
calling for over $1billion incoverage.) Whether these laws will apply to the TCIP i s
 currently being clarified. The current Disaster Law #7269 (which provides easy
 compensation to earthquake victims), along with the lack o f a strong insurance culture in
Turkey add to the challenges faced by the scheme.

 5.18      Land useplanning and enforcement of construction codes ($11.78 million). To
reduce vulnerability inthe region, this sub-component was designed to support a review
o f ongoing modifications inthe legal system and actions to strengthen municipal ability
to regulate, plan, and implementdisaster-resistant development. After a slow start,
implementationrecentlybegun to progress. Notably, a series o f groundbreaking
workshops has beenheld, engaging a variety of stakeholders, including the engineering
community, academia, local governments, lawyers, and legislators ina discussion o f the
UrbanDevelopmentFramework Act, the UrbanTransformation Draft Act, and the
BuildingRetrofittingCode.

5.19       Cadastre renovation and land management sub-components ($24.2 1million). The
idea behindthis sub-component i s to establish a contemporary land information system to
support the reconstruction and future development o f the Marmara Earthquake Region.
Implementedbythe General Directorateo f LandRegistry and Cadastre (GDLRC), it
finances the creation o f a cadastral database, the hardware needed to support the
database, map production o f current information needed for inventory and immediate
planning, and renovation o f cadastreregisters and associated maps, through basic field
measurements. The sub-component also finances the strengtheningo fthe GDLRC inthe
Marmara earthquake regionthrough increased operational capacity o f field offices and
institutional improvements. After a long decision process concerning cadastre and land
registrymethodology as well as waiting for government completion o f the regional land
information system(MERLIS), the component picked up speed. The OED mission

to affect the entity ( T O ) . Another point to note i s that, though the gains have been sustained for a number
of years, they have not increased. Market researchanalysis is currently being undertaken to alleviate the
situation.

witnessed that the constructionof cadastral offices had beencompleted, and understands
that the mapping of rural and urban areas and the procurement ofhardware and software
to operate the MERLIS systemwas scheduled to be finalizedby May 2005. It i s
reasonable to assume that this initiative will live on inthe GDLRC's wider vision to
modernizethe national land registration and cadastre system inthe next 10years by
completing the real estate cadastre inthe country, automate land registration offices, and
develop digital cadastre maps to support the e-government initiative.

Part I1systematically reviewschallenges faced and shows how each subsequent project built
upon the lessons o f its predecessors. ExaminingBank's work in this way allows for a better
look at progress made along the response/preparednesscontinuum. The three emergency
projects assessed, plus the more recent MEER and ISMEPprojects developed strategies and
activities to deal with the various problems they confronted. For the purpose o f analysis these
have been divided into short-term, medium-term, and long-term issues. Drawing from the
analysis inPart Iandwork which has beendone for the MEERand ISMEPprojects reveals a
more detailed picture o fprogress.

6.       NaturalDisasters and Turkey

6.1      Improvingthe way the nation confronts natural disaster involves preparing for less
frequent major disaster events as well as developing a response capacity for numerous
smaller ones. Looking at Bank projects inTurkey over the last 13 years provides valuable
lessons o f experience. The major events were:

     0   TheErzincan earthquake. In 1992, the Erzincanregion was hit by an earthquake
         measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale, and an aftershock two days later o f 6.1. The Bank
         responded with the Erzincan Earthquake Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project
         (L35 11-TR) o f $285 million.

     0  Flooding and landslides in the WesternBlack Sea Region. InM a y 1998, the Western
         Black Sea region suffered from severe flooding and landslides, killing less than 100
        people, but affecting 2.2 million over an area o f 37,000 square kilometers, and
         causing economic losses estimated at $500 milli~n.~' Bankrespondedby
                                                                 The
        preparinga $685 millionmultisectoral project, with a loan amount o f $369 million,
        the Emergency Flood and Earthquake Recovery Project (L4388-TR) (TEFER), to
        rebuild damaged infrastructure and pick up where Erzincanleft o f f with respect to
        institutional development andpreventiodmitigation.

     0   TheMarmara earthquake. Only a year after the TEFER project commenced, an
        earthquake o f magnitude 7.4 hit the industrial heart o f Turkey. The Marmara
        earthquake caused 17,480 deaths, 43,953 injured, and 66,441 collapsed or heavily
        damagedhousingunits. The Bank produced a three-part response. First, $267 million
        was reallocated from eight ongoing loanprojects. Second, a $252.53 million credit to
        support an immediate cash transfer program -the Emergency Earthquake Recovery
        Project (LA5 18-TR) was initiated, and a $505 millionreconstructionand disaster
        mitigationproject, the Marmara Emergency Earthquake Reconstruction Project
        (LA5 17-TR) (MEER), was designed and approved.

7.        Short Term Issues

7.1      Following a disaster, there are strong incentives for a country to rapidly assess its
immediate needs inorder to claim highdamages. Likewise, there i s pressure on the donor
community to respond generously and quickly.39Findingknowledgeable officials to work on
damage assessment i s difficult, however, giventhat hundreds and even thousands of victims
are makingurgent demands on public authorities for assistance and/or services. Inaddition,
they are almost certainly are operating under difficult circumstances (transport disruptions,
access difficulties, damagedpublic offices, possible loss or destruction o f files and other
records). Accurate assessmenti s also problematic. While it i s relatively easy to quantify
buildingsthat havebeen entirelydestroyed, it i s difficult to assessmediumto light damage4'
without careful on-site surveys conducted by specially trained personnel. Add to this the fact
that often people move out of the area following a disaster, stay with relatives, and/or fail to
maketimely damage claims.

7.2       When reports from various agencies acting under time pressure are synthesized into
one assessment, which has become standard practice inTurkey, there i s room for
miscalculationo fthe damage. Onthe other hand, when disaster assessments are credible, and
they include an assessment ofthe economic and social impact o fthe event as well as a
physicalneeds assessment, countries ultimately mobilize more assistancethanwould be the
case with clearly exaggerated claims.

Designinga RapidResponseRequiresClear Priorities andTradeoffs

7.3      Directly following disasters inTurkey, Bank missions have helped the government to
assess the damage and to design comprehensive emergency recovery projects for the Bank to
finance. The Bank documentation for the projects acknowledges the need for aresponse that
i s simple, rapidly executable, sharply focused, and not burdened with excessive
conditionality. The experience o f the four ongoing or completed projects shows that it i s not
that simple: there i s always a tradeoff between speed and thoroughness o f implementation.
The way inwhich the government and donors assist stakeholders during the first months after
each disaster can be seen to enhance or constrain the overall recoveryprocess.

7.4      Speed. The Bankresponse to disasters inTurkey has been rapid. In1992, a team
surveyed the damage inErzincan andprepared a project for approval ina matter of five
weeks. Likewise, for the 1998 TEFER project, the planswere prepared and approved inless
thanfive months, notwithstandinga second disaster that occurredduringprojectpreparation
requiringadditional plans for another disaster. In 1999, MEERwas prepared yet quicker.
Project plans were ready and approved within 12 weeks o f the disaster.



39. Project appraisal documents note that several past emergency loan projects (Columbia Popayan, Mexico
Earthquake, Jamaica Hurricane Emergency Reconstruction, El Salvador Earthquake, among others) reveal that
a speedy response is imperative.
40. Structures that have collapsed or are beyond repair are classified as heavily damaged. Structures that can be
repaired for between 6 and 30 percent o f their total replacement cost are considered medium damaged and 5
percent and below considered lightly damaged.

                                                      31


7.5       A quick Bankresponse has beeninstrumental infacilitating overall organization o f
the disaster response and donor coordination. Years ago, it was not uncommon for the Bank
team to wait for emergency-related activities to finishbefore makingan appearance. OP 8.50
Emergency Reconstruction, even states that the Bank does not do emergency relief. As will
be discussed below, this non-involvement with relief is becominga grey area; there are some
problems duringthe emergency reliefphase that are o f a scale to warrant World Bank
involvement.

7.6       Because Bank experience with emergencies suggests a needfor simplicity,
emergency projects tend to focus on activities that do not require elaborate preparationor for
which detaileddesigns canbe prepared duringimplementation. However, at times the quick
response resembles a lack of due diligence, resultingindelays. The Erzincan ICRnotes, "as a
result o f the rapid appraisal and approval o f the project, preparation work was not as rigorous
as inmore typical Bank supported projects. By Board approval, there were no designs or
draft tender documents prepared for the civil works, no agreedTORSfor the studies and
training activities, andno capacity inthe implementingagency for managingthe preparation
o fthe tender documents and subsequent c~ntracts."~~

7.7      Inthe case ofErzincan, inthename ofsavingtime, compromises were madebythe
project team andthe PTUwith the goal o f getting the victims into new housingbefore the
winter. But it was for naught. Though the loanwas preparedinfive weeks, construction
activities didnot start untiltwo years later (Spring/Summer 1994).42 So, with hindsight, time
could have been spent acquiring more desirable buildingsites and identifying (and counting)
eligible, interested beneficiaries. Most housingunits were completed duringlate 1995, almost
four years after the earthquake had struck (though one year ahead o f schedule).

7.8      Inthe case ofthe TEFER housingcomponent, the designprocesswas also
abbreviated inorder to house the families before winter arrived. Indoing so, however, the
designs were finishedbefore reliable estimates o f the number o f units needed were available,
and, as already noted inPart I,       twice as many homes were built than were needed.

7.9      Another result o f rushingthe design process hasbeen slow disbursements. The speed
withwhich disbursements would take placewas significantlyoverestimated duringproject
preparation (see Figure 1). Also, low implementationcapacity creates a "hurry up andwait"
situation. A key constraint to implementationinErzincanwas a lack o fcapable and
functioning administrative structure. It may bethe case that taking a little more time to
preparean emergency project would allow adequate attention to be givento temporary
shelter, and contribute to increasing the capacity to implement.

selection and work o f the consultants who assisted HDA with design and construction supervision for the four
mainconstruction components. These difficulties significantly contributed to the initial implementation delays."

 7.10        To summarize, the greatest flaw o fthe early disaster projects was the beliefthat
permanent housingcouldbeprovidedto victims ina matter o fmonths. Experience showed
that it inevitablytakes longer. The donor community hadpreviously learned that temporary
 shelter was to be avoidedbecausethe cost often equals the cost ofthe lost permanent home
 andthere havebeenmanysocialproblems associatedwithtemporary shelter.43Ofcourse,
most bad experiences were documented inwarm countries, and inplaces where it was
possible to construct temporary shelter out ofrecycledmaterials. For Turkey, the lesson
which was learned was that there are circumstances where projects do need to invest in
temporary shelter. And this iswhat was done under the Marmaraproject.

BankFundingOverestimationsCreatedthe FirstContingencyInsurancePool

7.11 When budgetingfor reconstruction after a major catastrophe many public officials
believe that it is better to overestimate the cost thanto runshort. Because of the frequency o f
disaster inTurkey, it can also be inferredthat the government had a hidden agenda-it
needed to overestimate inorder to have resources inhandfor the next disastrous event. After
all, the Turkish experience shows that major disasters can follow one another ina matter o f a
few months.

7.12         The fundingneeded to complete the original project components that involved civil
works was overestimated across the board. Followingimplementationo fthe physical
components ofthe Erzincanproject, 115 millioninundisbursed funds were treated by the
government as a reserve for the next disaster. The undisbursed project funds sat idle for years
(the project closed in2000, eight years after approval) accruingcommitment fees. Despite

the Bank's suggestions that the government close the loan, it declined.44And then the next
disasters struck: first the Senirkent mudslidedisaster of July 1995 and then Siitqiiler
mudslideso fNovember 1995.

7.13       The TEFER project hadbeen aresponseto (1998) floodinginthe Western Black Sea
region. Just a few months later, the city o fAdana was struck by an earthquake that measured
6.3 on the Richter scale, which destroyed masonry structures inthe city, nearbytowns, and
the surrounding countryside. Unspent bnds for the Erzincan institutional development
component were officially passed on to TEFER. Before flood and earthquake reconstruction
work could be completed (and a hnctioning disaster management agency established), the
catastrophic Marmara event occurred.

7.14      The lesson learned by the Bank and borrower following these disasters, i s that a
special pool o f funds is requiredon a permanent basis to help Turkey to smooth out the
lumpyfinancial demands ofrecurrent disaster. The way inwhich this was sustainably
accomplished i s discussed inthe section on disaster insurance under the long-term heading,
below.

Learningto Do AssessmentsThat Do NotOverestimateInfrastructureNeeds

7.15      Each o f the projects that built infrastructure, Erzincan, TEFER, and MEER,
significantly overestimated the scale of the ultimate demand. This was so eventhough they
eachanticipated (and compensated for) overestimation stemming from data synthesized from
sources inpoor communication with eachother.

7.16      InErzincan,duetoinaccuraciesintheoriginaldamageassessmentwhich formedthe
basis for the Bank's appraisal, 3,640 units o f cooperative housingwere slated to be repaired
or reconstructed, but duringthe project, only 1,13 1actually were. According to the project
completionreport, this was due to inaccuracies inthe original damage assessmentwhich
formed the basis for the Bank's appraisal. The actual number o f eligible damaged units

beconstructed (4, loo), based on damage andneeds estimates, was a.lmosttwice that which
turnedout to be amuch smaller number. Similarly, the originally planned number ofbarns to

was ultimately constructed (2,885) due to inaccuracies inthe original damage assessment
usedfor appraisal. Furthermore, the estimates didnot accurately incorporate the willingness
o fthe families whose homes were to bereplaced, to actually want to invest inthe housing
offered.

7.17      InTEFER, eventhoughtheprojectdesigncutthehousingneedsestimatereceived
from the government, the number o f housingunits ultimately constructed was nearly double




44. As noted inthe ErzincanICR: "The Bank had made several inquiries to the Government about canceling the
remaining funds. GOT was reluctant to cancel any loan funds and proposed other uses for the funds. The Bank
repliedthat it would be more appropriate to consider a newproject on its ownmerits rather than add new
activities to make use of the surplus funds. GOT'Sunwillingness to cancel the remaining funds was the
dominant factor behindthe request for amendment and extension, and the Bank fmally agreed since the
proposedactivities inSenirkent (and later inSiitqiiler) were similar innature to the original project activities,"

                                                         34


the amount required to meet the immediate claims o f eligible benefi~iaries.~~                MEER,was
closer to the mark inoverall occupancy (inmost sites housing occupancy ranges between 67
and 100percent). However, inthe case of one large site, Hereke, the occupancy reaches only
30 percent. More problematically, manyhousingoccupants inthe emergency projects should
never have been made emergency project beneficiaries becausethey never suffereda relevant
disaster-related loss. The beneficiary surveymentioned inPart Istates that 1,936
beneficiaries were living inthe TEFER-built housing (50 percent o fthe total beneficiaries o f
Cehanwere livinginthe housesbuilt inCehan, and 80 percent o f the total beneficiaries o f
Adana were livinginthe housesbuilt inAdana).                 46


7.18       Overestimations o fhousing demand and consequent oversupply o fhousing units
meant difficulties filling the available units.Beneficiarydemandhinged on the willingness o f
the disaster victims to wait for housingas well as on their interest inthe locationand layout
o f the units.This beneficiary interest, may have also been overestimated, as noted inPart I.
Emptyunitswere subsequently vandalized, strippedcompletely o f electricalandplumbing
fixtures and kitchen cabinetry and appliances, makingtheir subsequent occupation far more
difficult. Underutilized housingdevelopments generally sufferedrapid deterioration and
crime (for more on this, see the housing section, below).

7.19       Inthe MEERproject, the Bankproposed to finance replacements for 30percento f
the raw number of "uninhabitable units." These were defined as: collapsed, heavily damaged,
and mediumdamaged units inurbanareas (eligible under the Disaster Law).47Additionally,
two weeks before the construction contracts were signed, the borrower was responsible for
providing an update o f the damage assessment and eligibility estimates. Based on the
updates, the Bank reviewedthe total number o fhousingunits to be constructed inorder to
mitigate the risk o f over-investment,

ImplementationTime I s a Function of ImplementationCapacity as well as Task and
InstitutionalSimplicity

7.20      Inthe Erzincanproject, design sought to lowertheriskofdelay inproject execution
byrelyingprimarilyon existinginstitutions o fprovencapacity; makinga Ministero f State
fully responsible for the direction andcoordinationofthe project; andensuring full funding
for the project fiom the start o fproject execution. An effort was made to provide sufficient
flexibility both on the part of the government and the Bank to help resolve implementation
problems rapidly as they arose. Inpractice, project activities covered almost every sector o f
the local economy, which ledto an unwieldynumber of often very small contracts. Inthe
Erzincan project files, staff note that too many institutions were involved inthe project, and it
would have beenbeneficialifthe division o fresponsibilities betweenthe Bank and other
actors had left the project with 2-3 sectors to focus on.


45. Court cases, however, continue identifying additional beneficiaries. Some units that stood vacant have been
allocated to civil servant use, and others are being allocated to claimants under other programs.

 7.22    Itcanbe seen that over the years, Turkishdisasterprojects have learnedto be more
 agile (see Figure2). They havetriedto lower the risk of delay inmanyways -avoiding
 institutional complexity, choosing simple designs, andrelyingon existing institutions, to
 name a few.


  CashTransfer ProgramProvidedQuick, HighlyValued Assistance

 7.23    The Bank has traditionally tried to stay away from the emergency phaseo f disasters,
 letting specialized agencieshandlesearchandrescue, etc. One areaduringthe immediate
 post disasterphasewhere the Bankhas begunto discover it canbehelpfuli s inproviding
 income support when employmentopportunities are scarce andlocal economies are
 borderline non-functional. Cashtransfer programs provide up-fkont cash assistanceto
 earthquake victims. A key objective is to ensure that displacedpersonsand other groups
 madevulnerable bythe earthquakereceive adequateassistancewhile longer-term
 reconstruction efforts get underway.

 7.24    The $252.53 millionCashTransfer project (Emergency EarthquakeRecovery Loan
 [LA5 18-TRI assessed inPart Iofthis report) assistedthe government inresponding
 expeditiously to the Marmara earthquakebyproviding quick cash support for earthquake
 victims. Oncethe lessonhadbeenlearnedthat somethingneededto done about temporary
 housingbecauseit was not possibleto beat the coming ofwinter, several approaches to the
provision temporary housingwere adopted-possiblebecauseo fcashtransfers. Where there
.were rental units available, they were used. Paymentsfor accommodation assistancewent on
 for 18months andtotaled 75 percent o ftotal cashtransferbenefits. Some families were able

                                                        36


to approach the reconstruction of their former home inphases inorder to provide themselves
with temporary shelter. Repair assistancefor housingcomprised 13.4 percent o ftransfers.

7.25      Other benefits provided underthe cash transfer project included: disability benefits
(10 percent), and death benefit, survivor, and disability pensions (1.5 percent). Business
owners received lump sumpayments.

7.26     The Cash Transfer project was put together quickly because it usedinstitutions that
already existed inTurkey's social protectionsystem. When the disaster struck, the SSF
rapidly mobilized a large number o f temporary workers from all over the country, as well as
computers and other resources and systemsneeded to rapidly disburse project funds.
Compensation incashwas highly valued bybeneficiaries, and Bank support for project
expenditures was rapid. Quick action by the Bankundoubtedly made a major contribution to
the government's ability to respond quickly with socialprotectionpayments.


The Bank's Experience with Reallocating Funds

7.27     Inanattempt to provide immediate assistance, the Bankoftenreallocates funds from
ongoingprojects since it i s the quickest method o f fundingdisaster response. Eacho f the
            involved reallocated funds in some way - some received and some provided. The
Erzincanproject was amended twice to reallocateundisbursedfunds to two subsequent
disasters - mudslidesinSenirkent inJuly 1995, and again for flooding and landslides in
Siitqiiler inNovember 1995. When the TEFER project was prepared, with the exception o f
fundingdestinedfor institutionaldevelopment from Erzincanwhich was reallocated, the
notion o f responding to the disaster by reallocating funds from existing projects was rejected
becausethe level of resources that could be freed was inadequate andthe nature o f the
problemrequiredsustained attention to design. However, inthe midst o f project preparation,
inJune 1998, an earthquake struck near Adana inthe southernpart o fthe country. A
response to this, inthe form o f a 5,000-unit housing project, was added to the project under
preparation. When the Marmara earthquake struck, the response o f the government andthe
Bankincludedanimmediatereallocationof$267 millionfrom eight ongoingprojects
(including TEFER) for the reconstruction o f the Marmararegion.49About 17 percent o f the
original TEFER loan amount ($62.5 million) was reallocated for housing construction inone
of the affected towns, AdapazariYsoas well as to provide technical assistance. Once again, the
institutionalrestructuring component (originally from Erzincannow from TEFER)was
redirected to the next Bank-funded disaster project.

7.28     Looking back on the project experience with reallocation, staff involved remarked
that, inthe case o fdisaster, new financing tends to be used more effectively. I t is used in
ways that are more likely to be well designed and more attention i s givento the institutional

 structure. The best results seem to occur when such projects are managed by special disaster
 units that are authorized to make decisions, and are charged with responding quickly. When
 careful plans made for funds are suddenly abandoned and the same staff that helpedto design
 the original plans are expected to direct activities tied to the emergency, suboptimal results
 should not be a surprise.

 8.      MediumTerm Issues

 8.1     Inthemediumterm, theBankconstructedhousing, shopsandbusinesses,hospitals,
 municipal and rural infrastructure. These were o f highquality and constructed ina timely
 manner. The less tangible social aspects ofprojects, such as the creationo f owners and users
 associations, which are essential for sustainability, received too little attention.

 Housing-Urban and Rural

 8.2     In Turkey, earthquakes cause extensive damage to housingunits. 450,000 buildings
have sufferedheavy damage over the last century. Turkey's response is governed by the
 1959 Disaster Law #7269. The law commits the government to provide replacement units for
every family that lost their home inan earthquake. The precedent for compensating
earthquake victims with new housing was set following a 1959 earthquake, when the
provisions o fthe Disaster Law were codified. Buildinghousing following that earthquake
was a relatively easy task, giventhe small scale o f the 1959 disaster. However, full
replacement became more andmore difficult to replicate in subsequent disasters, given the
increasing number o f victims.

8.3      All ofthe infrastructure projects hadan element ofhousing. Erzincanfinanced the
building o f 2,183 houses, TEFER built 4,000 houses inAdana and 1,000 inCehan, MEER
built 12,008 houses.

8.4      All three projects built urbanandruralhousing. Inthe urbanareasBank financing led
to multi-familyhousingbuilt invery large numbers to remarkably highstandards5' The
Erzincan, TEFER, andMEERprojects all built multi-story, multi-block housing complexes
with 80-square-meter, two-bedroom units, on sites 10-20 minutes from the nearest urban
center. Each unit cost approximately $20,000. While the housingdesign might be criticized
for lack o fvariety, the constructioni s o f good quality. The approach to housingdesigns was
refined from one project to the next, but remained similar inall projects. For example, the
PIUimproveduponthe somewhat problematic Erzincanroofdesignwhen puttingtogether
the TEFERproject. Likewise, for the MEERproject, buildingdesigns took into account the
cool-damp climate o f the Marmara regionby introducingpitchedroofs to enable more
effective water proofing and insulation, heater exhaust vents, enclosed stairways, wall
insulation, and double-glazed windows. Inthe rural areas, families were allowed to select
from a number o f approved designs and build or contract the construction on their own,
leaming seismic-resistant techniques inthe process.


51. These generally consisted o f multi-story, urbanhousing blocks with two-bedroom, 80 s q munits.
Traditionally, an average of 77 net square meters is considered an acceptable standard, according to the TEFER
PAD.

                                                       38


Many Beneficiaries of Housing Refused the Facilities They Were Offered

8.5       Why were the percentagesofdisaster victims inproject-built housingso low? One of
the causes o f non-occupancy o f dwellings was that the allocationo f the houses didnot
consider the conditions o f the beneficiary's previous dwelling or his lifestyle, income, or
habits. This caused conflicts amongpeople coming from diversebackgrounds. TEFER- and
MEER-qualified housingbeneficiaries participatedinfocus groups where they were asked to
speak about the low up-take o f the units. 52 They reported that the major reasonthat
beneficiaries h?idnot moved to the assigned house was that they didnot want to leave their
original neighborhood. Beneficiaries reported a strong preference for rebuildingtheir own
damaged houses, rather thanmovingto the assigned houses innew neighborho~ds.'~                      Moving
meant dissolving social networks that often had generations o fhistory. The exercise found
that another reason families refusedto move inwas becausethey didnot have the money to
pay deposits for the water and electricityhookup. Others opted to turntheir eligibility into an
income stream: they rentedout their unit and livedina less expensive location. InAdana,
rents are paid for a year or two inadvance. Some o f the beneficiaries had already rented a
house and could not afford to move out when their permanenthousingwas completed.

8.6       The project-sponsored beneficiary survey found that people who didmove liked the
houses and thought that the space provided was adequate for small families. They also
appreciated the ample space for parkingandthe daylight inthe units.

8.7       One of the main variables affecting people's decision to move in, according to the
survey, was the type o fhousea givenbeneficiary hadbefore the earthquake. Those who had
previouslybeen living inan apartment were more inclined to move into the houses provided.
Also, it was found that the poor were less likely to move into the houses because o f larger
family size. Inthe post-disaster context, it proves important, especially whentargetingthe
poorest, to offer a variety o fhousing options. The fact that facilities were refused for various
reasons does not, however, meanthat the projects should have built bigger units. Such
expansion could be unsustainable not only from a financial standpoint, but also from an
urbanplanningviewpoint.

8.8      Unusedhousingwas almost non-existent inthe rural housing component. Inthe rural
housingcomponent implementedinthe MEERproject, the government gave 562
participating beneficiaries (out of a total o f 1,377 identifiedpotentialbeneficiaries) funding
and training inseismic-resistant buildingtechniques, and allowed them to select from among
a number o fpre-designed earthquake-resistant plans to buildor contract the construction on
their own house. Additional fundingcame, subject to the meetingo f certaincriteria
(excavation completed, foundation completed, etc.). Though the OED missionobserved that
the houseswere built much stronger than likely necessary, the approach was successful in
creating carefully and safely built homes to house the victims, insitu. Additionally, the plans

others to occupy the unsafe land once the original occupants have beenrelocated, however, defeating the
purpose.

 allowed for later, vertical, expansions. There is a consensus that the urbanhousing
 components could have benefitedfrom a more owner-driven approach.


 Shops, Businesses, and Barns-Cases of "Changed Use"

 8.9     Following the Marmara earthquake, inGolquk, the MPWS provided space int o w n for
 shops and businesses, which are now full. The shops andbusinesseslocated withinthe
 MEERhousingsites outside oftown are empty,however. Theuse anddisuse ofthe shops
 andbusinesses built by the ErzincanandMEERprojects suggest a number of important
 lessons.54

 8.10    Bothprojects suffered a similar problem inthat the stores, shops, and offices were
 constructed innumbers that vastly exceededdemand.Moreover, the beneficiaries were often
 uninterested inthe spaces offered becauseo fthe location (far from their original shop, and
 far from the city center)." Or they were unable to returnto their original businessesbecause
 the type o f facility they were offered didnot correspond to their trade. For example, a tire
 repair shop owner might get a second-story unit, or a newspaper seller might not have
 curbside frontage. No allowance was made for the reintroductiono f unusedunits into the
 market after aperiod o f years. This ledto commercial areas with low customer traffic due to
the number o f unusedunits.

 8.11    Staffreported that many unusedshops and business areas will be converted into
classrooms andturned over to local institutions o f learning. Another situation o f "changed
use" was encountered inErzincan. The cow barns constructed for farmers turned out to b e
too poorly insulated for cattle to survive inthem throughthe winter without a heating system
(which was not economically sustainable). They were subsequently converted to storage
sheds, or providedwith heat and used as homes, and inat least one case, a restaurant.

Social Issues Received Sufficient Attention Except in Housing and Shops Components

8.12    Oktay Ergunay and Mustapha Erdik, longtime Turkish disaster experts, notedthe
importance o f addressing the social aspects o f emergencies over 20 years ago, "The objective
o fpermanent housing should not be the provision o f fast shelter, but rather, shouldbe socio-
economic rehabilitation of the recipient^.'"^

8.13    Projects initially lacked coordinationof social and site needs with the main
constructionprogram. Multifamilyhousing inErzincan, TEFER, and MEERwas created
without the legally requiredmanagement committees to see to maintenance o f the commons
(including heating, public lighting, grounds, and repairs). Subsequently, it was realized that
landscaping, parking, andplay places were important elements to the design. Existing

already inthe MEERproject, they will be added to the TEFER housing ~ i t e s . Similarly,
                                                                                   ~ '
scores o f commercial structures with hundreds o f offices and stores were left to fend for
themselveswith no organizational structure created to cover monthly operating costs and
maintenance. The problems have beenredressed, to a varying extent, in each follow-on
project, however.

8.14    This i s not to say that no attention was paid to social issues during the projects. They
were takenmore into account inthe two more recent projects. The CashTransfer project
addressedvulnerability without buildingany physicalworks, Inthe MEERproject a social
scientist helped site engineers and local officials develop communication and consultation
programs. Social scientists helped to promote participation inthe rural housing scheme. And
families affected by land expropriation were identified by a targeted study. Public
informationcampaigns were set up for health services, andto inform the public about
damage assessments.s8Local officials charged with assessingdamage were provided training
on how to communicate effectively with the public. A special public informationcampaign
was conducted disseminating buildingcodes and related requirements.

9.      LongTermIssues

9.1     Mitigationworks need time. Vulnerability reduction depends on politicalwill.
Creating a disaster insurance capacity requires nearly simultaneous actions by legislative
branch andthe private sector. Since the Marmara earthquake, there seems to be a movement
from physical preparedness(e.g., seismically resistant construction, anti-seismic construction
norms) to social and self-preparedness(the "Self-protecting community approach").

Institutions for Disaster ManagementDevelopedover the Course of many Years

9.2     Subsequent to the Erzincanproject, the TEFER PAD recognized "while quick
responseto disaster is important, it i s equally important to identify underlying problems in
the policy andinstitutional environments, anddetermine how to resolve them inways that
result inlong term sustainable solutions to managing the risks o fnatural disaster^."'^

9.3     Though it has taken about 13 years, institutional capacity for natural disaster
management has improved since the Erzincanearthquake struck in 1992. Withpersistence,
gains have beenmade -disaster insurance i s now inplace, with over 2 millioninsured;
TEMADhas been formed andis takingroot; the PIUhas done anoutstandingjob o f
implementingreconstruction andmitigationworks since its beginningin 1992;andthe
MEERproject isbreakingnew ground, bringingstakeholders together to discuss urban
development legislation; among other things.

9.4     The Bank took advantage o fthe window o f opportunity following disaster to initiate
organization for disaster mitigation by adding it to emergency reconstruction efforts. Judging
from the experience across these projects, impleinentationo f institutional development plans

 were not the top priority, however. Successive attempts at creating an institutional capacity to
 manage and prevent natural disasters foundered, and looking at the institutional development
 achievements o f eachproject, inisolation creates a bleak picture. Incomplete institutional
 development components were passed from one project to the next, starting with the largely
 untouchedinstitutional development component inthe Erzincanproject. The responsibility
 for continuing this component was passedon to TEFER. One year after TEFER startup, the
 occurrence o f the Marmara earthquake sidetracked the institutionalrestructuringplanned
 under TEFER. The institutionaldevelopment aspect ofthe TEFER project was transferred to
 the MEERproject andmade more comprehensive.

 9.5      As aresult ofBank andPIUpersistence,there is now anewly created andMEER
 project-supported Emergency Management Directorate, TEMAD. Its responsibilityi s to act
 as the central coordinatingbody for preventionandpreparedness. Inthis capacity, it i s also
 responsible for monitoring and evaluating the preparation of short-term and long-term
 disaster mitigation plans o f governmental agencies and departments. With respect to
 response, it is responsible for conducting resource coordination activities, and for
 coordinatingthe receipt, protection, and transportation o frelief supplies.60

 9.6      TEMATP has had a difficult time getting started, but the PPAR mission observed that
 it is gaining traction. After longdelays, it is acquiringcritical equipment and strengthening
 its capacity to coordinate responseto natural disasters. It has also shown recently that it is
 capable o f aiding neighboring countries following disasters, as well as organizing
 international response and coordinationtraining.

 9.7      A PIUwas set up inthe HDAto oversee the implementationofthe first project,
Erzincan. At first, as any new organization, there was a certain amount o f learningthat
needed to take place. The group learned with time, and has since implementedmany disaster
projects for the Bank, as well as other donor organizations. The PPARmission consistently
found that this group i s highly regardedfor its hightechnical and professional standards, and
has done an outstandingjob with disaster-related projects, thanks to their highenergy and
hard-earned knowledge.

BankAttentionto MitigationI s Increasingon ManyFronts

9.8      Scientists anticipate that the regions o f Istanbuland Izmirare indanger o fbeinghit
by several earthquakes inthe relativelynear future. Findingaway to get mitigationinplace
quickly i s obviously a topic o f utmost importance. To this end, Bankprojects have funded a
number o fways ofmitigatingthe effects of future events. For instance, the Bankhas


60. Inaddition to TEMAD, Turkey has several entities that play varying roles indisaster prevention and
response (see Annex D for a full outline). Inthe event o f a crisis, the Prime MinistryCrises Management Center
manages coordination among the military and other associated ministries. The General Directorate o f Civil
Defense takes care o f the immediate response and rescue responsibilities. Other actors inthe response phase are
the General Directorate o f TurkishRed Crescent, the Ministry o f Defense/General Staff, the Ministry o fHealth,
and the Ministry o fForeign Affairs. Provincial and local governments also play a role inthe response and relief
phase. Following the responsehelief phase municipalitiesundertake reconstruction work, using funds provided
bythe central government. The General Directorate o fDisaster Affairs, inthe MPWS deals primarily with
recovery, conducting damage assessments and resettlement/reconstction for victims.

                                                                  42


supportedthe development and functioning of adisaster insuranceprogram inthe country
that will help provide additional liquidityinthe event o fa disaster. The Bank has funded
structurally sound, earthquake resistant multi-familyhousinginurbanareas, and steel
reinforced concrete homes inrural areas, the designs o fwhxh have beenvetted over the
courseo f several loans. Inflood-prone areas, as inSenirkent andSiitqiiler, the Bankhas
fundedconstructionof floodcontrol systems andafforestation, all o fwhich has contributed
to mitigating the effects ofnaturalhazards.

9.9      The Bankhas ledby example. Vulnerability hasbeenreducedbyhaving built good-
quality housing. As well, the housingwill serve as an example for other new housing. The
mayor of one town remarkedthat he couldnow use the Bank-funded housingproject as an
examplewheninnegotiations with developers"so they will buildtheir works as safe andas
pleasant as these."

9.10     The Bank is taking a long-term approachto disastersinits current work inTurkey.
The ISMEPproject, whichwill invest $400million inpreparingthe country for future
disasters, is scheduledfor approval inJune 2005. Ths 5 year Sector Investment Loan(SIL)
focuses 100percent on mitigation is inthe project approval stage. The project will initiate a
processthat aims at transforming Istanbul inthe next 10-20years into a city resilient to major
earthquake. The overall goal ofthe project is to save lives andreduce the social, economic,
andfinancial impactsinthe event offuture earthquakes. The specific objective oftheproject
i s to improve the city of Istanbul's preparednessfor apotential earthquake through enhancing
the institutional and techrucalcapacity for disastermanagement and emergencyresponse,
strengtheningcritical public facilities for earthquakeresistance, andsupporting measuresfor
better enforcementof buildingcodes.

 Disaster Insurance Scheme Has Taken Initial Hold

 9.12     The concept of disaster insurance is relatively new to Turkey.6'A disaster insurance
 schemehas been initiated, along with changes inlegislation(buildingcodes, disaster law), to
 lessen the burdeno f future disasters on the government.

 9.13     The idea o f starting an earthquake insurance scheme was first explored inthe
 Erzincanproject. The project included fundingfor a study to explore the feasibility o f a
 disaster insurance system for the country. The subject was pursued again inTEFER,
 beginningin 1998. The TEFER project carried out an investigation that determined that the
 financial policy o f the government was not conducive to the success o f an insurance scheme.
 The resultant study clarified the issue and the shortcomings o f the situation, yet didnot
 define the changes necessary for the success o f an insurance scheme inthe country.

 9.14    Almost 10 years after the Erzincan disaster, a compulsory insurance scheme finally
 took hold, with support from the MEERproject and the establishment o f the TCIP. The
 principal development objective of the Disaster Insurance Scheme sub-component o fMEER
 was to support the Government Earthquake Insurance Program with the view o f establishing
 andexpanding national catastrophic risk management andrisk transfer capabilities. To do so
 the sub-component created an insurance mechanism to make liquidityreadily available to
 tax-paying owners o fresidential dwellings destroyed or damaged by an earthquake for the
purpose o ftheir repair or replacement; reduce government fiscal exposure andthe risk to the
 national economy due to major earthquakes; ensure the financial solvency o f the Insurance
Pool after all but the most catastrophic o f events, such as those in excess o fthe Marmara
 earthquake; and reduce government financial dependence on the Bank and other donors'
 financial assistance inthe aftermath o fmajor earthquakes.

 9.15    The original proposal amounted to $273 million inassistance to finance two major
activities: (i) technical assistanceto the General Directorate o f Insurance (GDI) in
establishing catastrophic insurance pool (TCIP) and ensuringits operational efficiency and
financial soundness for the first five years o f its existence; and (ii) capitalization of
                                                                              initial
T C P through a contingent loan facility.

9.16     The insurance costs on average, one lump sum payment o f $46.62Payment o fthis sum
will insurethe bearer for a full year, andmust berenewed.To purchase insurance, one needs
to own a house and pay real estate taxes. Public awareness o f the benefits o f the insurance i s
key to expanding the system. The bearer mustrealize that inthe event o f a disaster, the
government would pay out perhaps only halfof what an insurance company would pay out,
making the $46 payment more apparently worthwhile. Given that the government has a long
history of paying for relief and rehabilitation following disasters, the apparent incentive to
pay for disaster insurance is low. It would be difficult for the government to change its
assistance policy inthe wake o f a disaster. For insurance to catch on, homeowners would

62. Insurance premiums vary according to a risk map which divides the country into 5 risk levels. Eachlevel
pays a premium commensurate with its level of risk.

needto beaware ofhow the payout to the insured would measureup to government
assistanceto those not purchasing insuranceinorder to makeaninformed investment.

9.17    On average, 15 percent ofthe 13 millioneligiblehomes inTurkey are insured. Inthe
Mannara Region, this figure reaches25 percent. Those currently insuredare so insured
becauseo fthe project, andthey are inreinforcedhousingand are less likely to be inthe
group suffering damages inthe event o fanotherdisaster. The total number o fpolicies in
effect over time is shown inFigure4.

Figure 4: Total Number of DisasterInsurance PoliciesinEffect




9.18   The graph indicates that the first year (soon after the Marmara earthquake) the TCIP
sold reachedthe 2,400,000 policies mark.However, the number o fpolicy holders dropped
sharplyto 1,800,000 soonthereafterwhehthe government declaredthat itwouldhelp all
people livinginthe disaster areawithout differentiating between insured anduninsured
victims. Hence, people didnot see the need for an insurancepolicy. Subsequent drops inthe
numbers(April2003, June 2004) were due to similar shocks.

    0   Address the squatter and code compliance problems. Ifa house is illegal because it i s
        on someone else's land, it is difficult to insure. And many houses are illegal for other
        reasons- some have proper original designs, but owners make changes to approved
        plans during construction. Some are builtproperly, but neveracquired a building
        permit. And so on.
    0   Set insurancepremiums high enough. While the idea is to attract policyholders with
        low premiums, the reality must be sustainable. People thenexpect that the premium
        will always be so low, makingit difficult for the industry to raise the rates enough to
        support itselfthrough time. This hashappened inBank experience (India). However,
        measures have been taken inthe case o f Turkey, including government upgrade o f the
        premium to a secure level on a one-time basis, removal o f rate-setting responsibility
        from Parliament, andindexing o f the newly strengthened rates to an independent
        construction price index issuedby the MPWS.


 10. Lessons

 10.1   The following lessons arise from boththe experience of individualprojects
responding to natural disasters inTurkey and from the collective experience o f the four
projects over time.

Bank involvement during the emergencyphase can be highly beneficial.
Expeditious cash support proved valuable to disaster victims on an individual financial and
psychological level as well as on a macroeconomic level. A cash transfer project, while risky
ifcontinuedfor the longtermbecauseofthepotentialto createdependency, canbeausehl
meansto providing stability and safety to victims. The CashTransfer projectprovided
support to victims ina time o f intense need. The promptly provided support enabled people
to survive, put funds into the economy, and was reported as highlypreferable to in-kind
support bybeneficiaries.

TheBank needs to develop a clearer understanding of which aspects of emergency
response can be rushed, and which cannot.
Analysis o fthe projects reveals a need to get on the groundquickly, but then take the
necessary time to prepare. The prompt fielding o f Bankteams enabledmore effective donor
coordination, which proved usefulto the Government o f Turkey inorganizing funding for the
recovery effort. However, quickly prepared plans for reconstruction met with hugedelays.
More time spent inthe designphase couldbe afforded andmight be time well spent. An
emergency creates pressure to opt for speed at the expense of detail, yet it i s the details that
determine the outcome o f a project. Taking the time to develop a finer textured design could
have lesseneda number o fproblems.

Greater accuracy of damage assessmentsis still needed to avoid unnecessary construction.
Although there hasbeenprogress, andthe Marmara responsehadthe most comprehensive
damage assessmento f any o fthe projects, more precise estimates o fpublic and private
infrastructure requirements would leadto significant (financial and social) cost savings and a
faster retum to normality.

                                                 46


Addressing the social and economic recovey aspects of emergencyprojects, although
difJicult, is criticalfor the sustainability of the reconstruction investments.
The Bank has a long and positive experience interms o f the execution o fphysical
components o f projects -the physical designo f the housinginErzincan, TEFER, and MEER
is appropriate and o f good quality. The failure to create legally requiredsocial organization
necessary for upkeep and decision-making inthe housing areas causedproblems, however.
Although considerable learning took place from one project to the next, incorporatinglessons
learned from a number o f studies, and involving social scientists inthe project process,
creating the necessary sustainableusers organizations to manage infrastructure remains an
unsolved challenge. Creating a capacity for maintenance i s often as critical to long-term
vulnerability reduction as the quality o fthe initial construction.

Reducing vulnerability to earthquakes requires different approachesfor rural and urban
areas.
For rural areas, project approachesthat were notably successful and worthy o f replication in
future projects include:
    0   Incorporatingseismic-resistant buildingtraining into the rural housing component
    0   Linkingpayments to easily definable construction progress
    0   Rebuildinginsitu
For urbanareas, successful strategies include:
    0   Preservingpre-disaster social networks, proximity tojobs.
    0   Promotingpolicies that favor the creationo fmarkets, shops, and related commercial
        development and services.
    0   Fostering stable urbancommunities by creating a safe space for parents and children
        (playgrounds, parks, sports fields). Likewise,basic site amenities such as
        landscaping, parking, erosion control/adequate drainage, contribute to a positive
        environment.
For bothrural and urban areas:
    0   Providing a reasonablerange o f design options to cover differences infamily size and
        occupations.
    0   The creationo f a sense community and o f trust contributes to infrastructure
        maintenance, and even community survival.

CASs in disasterprone countriesshould thoroughly addressdisaster risk.
Giventhat eachprojectnotes that a disaster o f that magnitude was not anticipated inthe
CAS, there appears to be room for increased anticipation o f disasters inthe CAS, andbetter
overall preparednesson the part of the Bank.With the frequency o f disasters inTurkey, they
should not be treated as an unexpected interruption o fbusiness as usual. Bank task managers
need guidance on recovery strategies, expedited contracting procedures, and disaster-resistant
design criteria whenresponding to large emergencies. The scale o f urgently needed
construction inthe immediate post-disaster context can be expected to exceed governmental
management capacity at the outset.

CreatingNew Disaster Management Institutions takes more time than is available under
oneproject.

                                                47


Although it was anticipated that Bank involvement inErzincanwould help to prevent the
recurrence of similar damage inthe htureby increasing capacity for hazardmitigation, such
a goal proved impossible to obtain in one project cycle. As it turns out, inTurkey
institutional development took place slowly acrossmany years and several projects. During
the periodwhen emergency reconstruction needs are high, institutionaldevelopment issues
can be neglected. Focus i s on getting people housed. Nevertheless, through the
implementationo f several projects, the idea o fpreparednesshas taken root, andbecome a
topic o f discussion. Turkey's focus is moving from crisis management to disaster
preparedness.

Cash Transfer projects can make an extremely important contribution to recovery.
Lessons from the one experience are:

    0   Itwas possible to effectively and accurately administer emergency cash transfers on a
        large scale.
    0   Usinginstitutionswith cashtransfer experience, and that already have the necessary
        humanresources andmanagement systems inplace, was critical to smooth delivery
        o f the assistance program.
    0   Getting cash support to victims quickly, positively affected the economy andperhaps
        even affected people's sense o f safety and security. It was a prominent first sign o f
        the government's support inatime of acuteneed.
    0   Theprocess was streamlined by SSF staff, volunteers, other government agencies,
        andNGOs worked together. Inone project site, applicationprocessing, bank account
        creation (for allowances), andresult notification were combined into one procedure.
    0   Because cash transfer runs the risk o f creating dependency, public awareness
        campaigns are required that makeclear up front the number o f months that payments
        will bemade. Whenbeneficiaries know this, they canmakeinformed resource
        allocation decisions. Otherwise, going month to monthwithout clear information on
        the duration o fpayments can lead to dependency beyond the short-term.

Beneficiary knowledge was not adequately valued or used.
The barns, though well built, are not beingusedto house animals becausethe engineers who
designed them did not realize how cold the winters were inErzincan. InSutqiiler the waste
water treatment plant was not wantedby the municipality, which refused to cover its
operating costs or to staff it. While it may have beenthe lowest cost technology to build,
maintenance costs could not be covered by local funding.

Overestimating infrastructure needs can lead to major socialproblems.
Eachpost-disaster assessmentprocess was significantly flawed. All the projects that built
new infrastructure significantly surpassedthe existing demand. There is an incentive for
agencies to overestimate because allocating surplus units provides rent and other benefits.
Before that can happen, however, overestimation o fbeneficiaryneeds ledto empty units,
smashed glass, brokendoors, looting, and a succession o f social problems associated with
crime and insecurity. The shops and businessesneed a low-crime environment and a critical
mass o f functioning units to become successful as a mall. With too manyunits built, the
concentrations ofbusinesses were low, thus taking away from the success o f the whole.
