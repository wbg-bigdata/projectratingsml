Introduction
On August 17, 1999, a severe earthquake devastated the northwestern area of Turkey bordering on the
Marmara Sea. It caused extensive damage to housing, infrastructure, electric power lines, and the
country's largest refinery. Although damage to larger firms was limited, many small enterprises were
damaged or destroyed, and resultant unemployment was widespread. Around 17,000 people lost their lives,
44,000 were injured, and over 200,000 were made homeless. The social and psychological impact was



enormous.
The fiscal demands on the government were huge. The earthquake struck just as Turkey's economy was
recovering from a sharp downturn in the wake of the 1998 Russian financial crisis. And the disaster
occurred as the Government was beginning to implement essential economic reforms including a
macroeconomic stabilization program that required strong fiscal adjustment. The Government and the
Bank recognized that if Turkey had to borrow on domestic markets to meet the huge costs of the
earthquake, it would be very costly because of extremely high real interest rates, and would crowd out
private investment. It would also severely jeopardize the country's hard-won progress in macroeconomic
stabilization.
The EERL was part of a package of assistance assembled by the Bank and other donors. The EERL
supported urgent, short-term needs caused by the earthquake. In addition, to support the Govermnent's
medium-term reconstruction and disaster mitigation efforts, the Bank initiated the Marmara Earthquake
Emergency Reconstruction Project (US$505 million), and also reprogrammed US$267.3 million of
commitments under existing projects. The IMF, EU, and bilateral donors also provided substantial
assistance.
It should be noted that the EERL had an innovative design in that it was the first disaster relief project in
which Bank support for the budget was provided specifically to support social assistance to the affected
population. EERL provided compensation for victims in cash, which was much preferred by beneficiaries
because they could purchase their own supplies, shelter, etc., rather than receive inappropriate items which
they would then need to resell.
3. Assessment of Development Objective and Design, and of Quality at Entry
3.! Original Objective:
The original objectives were to:
1. Assist the Government of Turkey to respond quickly and effectively to the impact of the Marmara
earthquake which hit on August 17, 1999.
2. Help ensure that the following social protection payments to earthquake victims were made to all
eligible beneficiaries:
a.    "Repair allowance" paid by the Social Solidarity Fund (SSF)
b.    "Accommodation allowance" paid by the SSF
c.    Lump-sum death and disability payments made by the SSF, and
d.    Workplace allowance (for damaged or destroyed workplaces)
e.    Payments made by the three social insurance funds (SSK, Bag-Kur and ES) for death
benefits, survivor pensions and disability pensions which are attributable to the earthquake.
3. Assist the Govemment to keep its economic reform program on track.
In the course of the EERL, another objective emerged (although the objectives were not formally revised).
This new objective was to improve the capacity of Turkish institutions--especially the SSF--to respond to
future emergency situations by providing cash benefits. This goal emerged as the project team identified
ways improvements could be made in the capacity of Turkish institutions to handle a natural disaster such
as the Marmara earthquake.
-2 -



Assessment of Objectives
The objectives were clear and were directly linked to alleviating the suffering caused by the earthquake and
assisting the government to take initial steps toward recovery. The objectives were realistic, although there
was clearly a risk that agencies would not be able to respond quickly enough, or with adequate assistance,
to mitigate the suffering. The provision of Bank funding supported the government's efforts to keep its
economic reform program on track by alleviating the government's need to turn to domestic capital markets
for additional funding, an action that certainly would have had harmful effects on the macroeconomic
environment.
The project was quick-disbursing, intended to assist Turkey to respond rapidly and effectively to the needs
created by the disaster. The loan provided financing for incremental private sector import needs against a
positive list of imports' resulting from the quake and for budgetary expenditures related to the recovery
effort (including social protection needs.) Loan disbursement was made against documentation of
allowances paid. The EERL provided immediate support for short-term spending needs while other,
medium-term reconstruction and disaster mitigation efforts such as the MEER project got underway.
EERL provided compensation for victims in cash. According to the beneficiary assessment, beneficiaries
very much preferred cash support to in-kind support. This was because cash support allowed recipients to
purchase their own supplies, shelter, etc. In-kind support often consisted of goods that didn't fully meet
beneficiaries' needs, and thus needed to be resold, with attendant additional effort and lower return.
3.2 Revised Objective:
The objectives were not formally revised, although as noted a new objective emerged during
implementation.
3.3 Original Components:
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS SUPPORT:                                US$       252,500,000
CONSULTANT SERVICES FOR IMPLEMENTATION                      US$       30,000
3.4 Revised Components:
The components were not revised.
3.5 Quality at Entry:
Quality at entry was satisfactory. The EERL was prepared very quickly, as appropriate for an emergency
project. Following the earthquake on August 17, 1999, EERL was appraised on October 10, approved by
the Board on November 11, and made effective on December 14. Because of the provision for retroactive
financing, the loan was able to disburse US$ 99.5 million in December, 1999, at a time when it was most
needed (Figure 1 below illustrates the disbursement profile). While of course the project could not have
been foreseen by the CAS, EERL strongly supported the goal of keeping the government's reform program
on track. Because lending to address the urgent situation resulting from the earthquake exceeded the "High
Case" amount, Bank management approved an increase in the lending envelope of US$750 million to
accommodate new emergency lending.
-3 -



The EERL was prepared in accordance with key lessons learned from earlier disaster recovery operations
including the 1998 earthquake and flood recovery project in Turkey, Hurricane Mitch in Central America,
and the events in Macedonia and Albania following the Kosovo crisis. The lessons of these operations are
that successful emergency recovery projects:
* require early Bank involvement in defining a recovery strategy
* necessitate streamlined implementation arrangements
* require flexible design
* should pave the way for dealing with longer-term structural reforms
* should be simple and not burdened with conditionality
In addition, to maximize the integrity and accountability of the EERL, the project included provisions to
undertake two independent assessments of efficacy and efficiency: (1) an Operational Review, conducted
by a private accounting firm, assessing: (a) the adequacy of procedures and systems used in project
implementation, and, (b) the efficiency and effectiveness of the results; and a Beneficiary Assessment,
undertaken by Istanbul University Department of Anthropology, with the technical cooperation of the
World Bank, which investigated how people were coping with the aftermath of the earthquake and how
successful the allowances and benefits were in reaching their intended target populations.
It should also be noted that the field agency selected by the government to implement the bulk of the
project, the Social Solidarity Fund (SSF), was well qualified to perform the duties required. SSF had a
nationwide network of 900 offices, and an effective framework for the distribution of funds throughout the
country. When the disaster struck, SSF rapidly mobilized a large number of temporary workers from all
over the country, as well as computers and other resources and systems needed to rapidly disburse project
funds, while maintaining accountability. According to the Operational Review, "staff working in local
offices managed to overcome problems with the lack of accurate information and difficult working
conditions."
The positive list included construction materials; construction equipment and industrial machinery; spare
parts, raw materials, and intermediate goods for industry and services; medical supplies and equipment;
petroleum products and coal; water and land transport vehicles.
Implementing agencies were the Public Finance General Directorate of the Undersecretariat of the
Treasury, and the Central Bank of Turkey. Field agencies were the SSF and the three social insurance
funds mentioned above.
4. Achievement of Objective and Outputs
4.1 Ouitcomelachiei ement of objective:
Introduction
The EERL was satisfactory in achieving its objectives. In very difficult circumstances, field agencies did a
very good job of quickly setting up field offices, hiring temporary staff, processing applications
expeditiously, and assuring that applicants received their benefits, with minimal errors.
Objective 1-Assist Government to Respond Quickly and Effectively
The EERL was satisfactory in assisting the government to respond expeditiously to the catastrophe. Bank
support for project expenditures was rapid. As shown in Figure 1, 41 percent of total project funds had
been disbursed by the end of December, 60 percent by the end of January, and 80 percent by the end of
- 4 -



March. Quick action by the Bank undoubtedly made a major contribution to the government's ability to
respond quickly to the disaster with social protection payments.
For SSF, which disbursed around 98 percent of the funds expended, applications for benefits were
submitted locally and were reviewed by an existing structure of a Local Approval Committee comprised of
senior govermment officials and prominent citizens. Actual payments were then made by Vakifbank, the
payment agent, based on locally-provided payment orders. Transfers of funds to the payment agent were
then made through SSF headquarters in Ankara.

Objective 2-Help Ensure that Payments Are Made to all Eligible Beneficiaries
The EERL was satisfactory in ensuring that payments were made to all eligible beneficiaries. Treasury
and the Central Bank of Turkey and the World Bank carefully monitored the performance of the agencies
implementing the project in the field, and established that the project was largely effective in providing
up-front cash assistance to earthquake victims. This conclusion was reached as a result of interviews
during the course of the project with agency staff at all levels--including front-line staff--numerous field
visits and interviews with beneficiaries, and two independent ex-post assessments (described in detail
below). Despite the difficult working conditions, benefits were provided to nearly all eligible beneficiaries
who applied. While several shortcomings were identified, these were relatively minor in the context of the
overall program. Table 1 below shows the types of assistance supported by the loan, and the field agencies
distributing that assistance.

As noted earlier, the two independent assessment mechanisms built into the project to maximize its integrity
and accountability were: (1) an Operational Review of the adequacy of procedures and systems used in the
project; and the efficiency and effectiveness of the results; and (2) a Beneficiarv Assessment of how
successful the allowances and benefits were in reaching their intended target populations.
The Operational Review, conducted by a private consulting firm, concluded that "Overall the applications'
processing and benefits' distribution appear to have been efficient and largely effective. A very large
number of applications (several hundred thousand) were handled over a relatively short period of time,
particularly by the SSF with recourse to local offices..." At the same time, the Review noted that there
were: "...weaknesses in the information and monitoring activities of these institutions [SSF and SSII."
These shortcomings are discussed below.
The Beneficiary Assessment (BA) was based on structured interviews with 1,200 households, and 135
additional in-depth interviews (more than 5,000 people altogether). While the BA sample was not random,
some indicative results can be drawn. Overall, the BA reported that 85% of survey respondents were
satisfied with the process, with the primary deficiency reported that administering officials were very busy.
For the accommodation and repair allowances, of those interviewed approximately 95-96% of those who
applied received the benefit, a very low rate of exclusion error. However, only 54-63% of households
which suffered medium or heavy damage applied for these benefits. Why did more than 40% of households
with significant damage not apply? From the interviews, the main reason seemed that the household had
applied for pre-fabricated housing, which would have excluded them from eligibility. Other reported
reasons include lack of information about the program, difficulties in obtaining necessary documentation,
missing the deadline (March 10, 2000), or difficulties with officials administering the program. Inclusion
error, whereby ineligible beneficiaries received benefits, were reported in the BA as "limited."
Of the 1,200 households surveyed, just 47, or about 4 percent, reported that they had experienced a death
as result of the earthquake. Of these 47 households, 72 percent had applied for the death benefit, and in the
case of nearly all of those who did not apply, the relative was not a "first degree relative" who died, as was'
required to receive benefits.
Shortcomings--A general problem identified was a degree of uncertainty and delay among administering
agencies in promulgating clear definitions of the categories of assistance agreed under the project. While
this caused some delay and confusion, this was largely overcome as the project progressed.
-6 -



One area in which a shortcoming was identified was the eligibility of families that stayed in tent cities for
accommodation and repair allowance, which appeared to have been administered inconsistently during part
of the project. The situation was analyzed by the Government after the mid-term review (June, 2000), and
the government acted to remove nearly 3,000 ineligible people from the rolls and terminate their payments.
The shortcomings identified were largely the result of the very high volume of claims, the decentralized
structure of the SSF, and the difficult working conditions under which benefit administration took place.
The Operational Review found that, despite these obstacles, the efficiency and effectiveness of the process
of fund distribution was, as noted, largely satisfactory.
Objective 3-Assist the Government to Keep the Reform Program on Track
The Government had launched its 3-year reform program in mid-1999, just before the earthquake. The
EERL undoubtedly mitigated the immediate impact of the earthquake on the country's ability to keep its
macroeconomic program on track and thus was satisfactory in achieving the goal of assisting the
government to keep the reform program on track.
Immediately after the earthquake, the Central Bank's intervention helped calm markets, and the
government's decision to seek a supplemental tax package signaled its intent to maintain fiscal discipline.
In December, 1999, Turkey reached a US$4 billion Stand-by Agreement (SBA) with the IMF which
required substantial structural reforms and set specific macroeconomic targets. Bank support included a
US$760 million Economic Reform Loan, approved in May, 2000.
Immediately after the SBA was reached, significant progress was made under the program, with fiscal
performance generally good, major privatization deals completed, a controlled depreciation ("crawling
peg") of the lira in line with inflation targets, and lower inflation.
However, in the second half of 2000, problems emerged. Inflation was higher than targeted, causing the
lira to strengthen in real terms. Structural reforms fell behind schedule, including: legislation to open
energy markets and eliminate special-purpose public sector funds; privatization delays; and implementation
of banking sector reforms. These deficiencies affected capital movements, and the current account
deteriorated. In November, 2000, a serious banking and liquidity crisis developed. In early December, the
IMF agreed to provide a Supplementary Reserve Facility of US$7.5 billion, which, along with US$2.9
billion outstanding from the existing stand-by accord, provided support of over US$ 10 billion. The Bank
added the US$ 778 Financial Sector Adjustment Loan, also approved in December.
Markets were unsettled for the next few months, and in February, 2001, another financial crisis developed,
with substantial pressure on the "crawling peg" for the Lira. The government decided to float the currency
in late February, and within two months the lira lost around half of its value, with interest rates and
inflation increasing dramatically.
In February, disbursements under the December, 1999 IMF Stand-by Agreement were suspended. In early
March, the government appointed Kemal Dervis, a former World Bank Vice President, as minister of state
responsible for the Treasury, and later in the month a "framework agreement" was reached with the IMF.
In May, the IMF announced additional lending of US$10 billion (in addition to the earlier commitments),
and disbursements resumed.
Achievement of the "fourth objective," strengthening the capacity of administering agencies to cope with
- 7 -



a future event, is assessed as satisfactory and is discussed below under institutional development impact.
Monitoring Indicators
The project included three monitoring indicators:
*   Gross reserves of the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT) not to fall below five months of import of
goods and services.
As measured by Goods and Non-Factor Services (GNFS)-the standard Bank definition of
imports-CBT reserves were above five months imports for nearly the entire project period. It is
important to note that CBT reserves were more than adequate to support the crawling peg
exchange rate regime that had been established under the SBA.
*   Primary Surplus of the consolidated Central Govemment to be not less than 1.0 percent of GNP.
According to official data, the primary surplus of the consolidated Central Govermnent was
approximately 1.5 percent of GNP in 1999, and 4.6 percent in 2000.
e   Payments under project-supported programs must be made to all eligible beneficiaries.
Statements from the SSF and the three SSI Funds indicate that, as far as they had been able to
determine, nearly all eligible beneficiaries who applied received payments. Observations by Bank
supervision missions, including field visits, confirm this finding, and data provided by the UT
Directorate of Public Finance, confirmed by implementing agencies, also indicate that
project-supported programs covered all eligible beneficiaries. Finally, as described above, two
independent assessments of the project concluded that it was largely effective in providing benefits
to nearly all eligible beneficiaries who applied.
4.2 Outputs by conmponents:
The project had just two components, Balance of Payments Support, US$249,970,000, and Consultant
Services for Implementation, US$30,000. Therefore, outputs have been described above, organized by
specific project objectives.
4.3 Net Present Value/Economic rate of return:
It was not possible to calculate a net present value or economic rate of return.
4.4 Financial rate of retturn:
It was not possible to calculate a financial rate of return.
4.5 Institudtional development impact:
The institutional development impact of the EERL was substantial, and was achieved in two ways: (1)
Learning by Doing--As described earlier, as the project proceeded, agency management and staff
encountered obstacles, and learned how to overcome them. The process of implementing the project
dramatically expanded the competency and know-how of SSF to manage a catastrophe of this magnitude
by rapidly disbursing cash assistance.
(2) Analytical Work--Agency capacity was further developed when US$30,000 of project funding was
redirected toward strengthening SSF capacity to deal with future disasters. This was effected by a
comprehensive consultant analysis of where shortfalls had occurred in the response to the earthquake, and
detailed actions that would address these. Specific outputs of this effort included publication of an SSF
- 8 -



"Emergency Manual," detailing systems and procedures to be used if an event such as this were to occur
again; and functional and technical specifications for the enhancement of SSF data systems. The
Government is currently assessing options for how it will proceed in undertaking the latter work.
5. Major Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcome
5.1 Factors outside the control of gov ernment or implementing agency:
*   It should be kept in mind that the EERL was implemented on an urgent basis, and in a region where
much of the infrastructure (roads, water, electricity, telecommunications) had been destroyed, which
made the process of relief and recovery much more difficult.
5.2 Factors generalliy subject to government control:
*   The agencies selected by the Government to distribute the project funds were experienced
organizations, in many cases with a wide network of facilities, which were well-suited for this task.
5.3 Factors generally suibject to imnplementing agency control:
*   The agency that implemented the bulk of the project, the Social Solidarity Fund (SSF), was well
qualified to perform the duties required. SSF had a nationwide network of offices, and an effective
framework for the distribution of funds. When the disaster struck, SSF rapidly mobilized a large
number of temporary workers from all over the country, as well as computers and other needed
resources and systems.
5.4 Costs and financing:
Project costs were US$ 252.5 million, as envisioned. The closing date was extended by 3 months to permit
the completion of analyses and recommendations for how GOT can improve its capacity to respond to
future catastrophes.
6. Sustainability
6.1 Rationale for sustainability rating:
Different parts of the EERL varied in terms of the extent to which they were designed and intended to be
sustained, as discussed in the following sections. Overall, sustainability is judged to be likely:
1. Payments by SSF to earthquake victims were designed to be temporary. However, the program did
help victims to recover from the impact of the quake and rebuild their lives. Many beneficiaries have
moved successfully from the tents to pre-fabs and will now move on to new permanent housing. This
process is still ongoing. In the end, the government will be left with some families still in tents and
special programs will be needed to help them reintegrate. While the final outcome cannot be
deternined at this point, the benefits of assisting people to rebuild their lives will endure, and it is
implausible that the government would simply abandon the remaining tent families. Sustainability of
this program is likely.
2. Social insurance payments by the funds (ES, SSK, BK) are ongoing and there is no indication that
they will not continue. Sustainability is highly likely.
3. The objective of helping to keep the reform program on track was met during the "lifespan" of the
EERL, which was designed to be an emergency intervention. The reform program has moved forward
after the February financial crisis, and is being supported by significant new World Bank lending. In
particular, a new human development project, the Social Risk Mitigation project (US $500 million) is
being developed with the SSF as implementing agency, thanks to its excellent track record under the
-9-



EERL. Thus, the EERL has directly led to follow-on projects in social assistance in Turkey.
4. The fourth project objective was to improve the capacity of the SSF to respond to emergency and
non-emergency situations with cash benefits. As described earlier, this goal was largely achieved, both
through the experience of overcoming obstacles and implementing the project, as well as through
specific analytical work conducted to upgrade capacity, and through publication of an "Emergency
Manual." Government is now actively seeking a mechanism by which to undertake agency upgrading
work. Sustainability is judged as likely.
6.2 Transition arrangement to regular operations:
As noted above, as part of operating ongoing programs, government is continuing to assist victims to
recover from the impact of the earthquake. This activity is being financed from regular budgetary funds.
7. Bank and Borrower Performance
Bank
7.1 Lending:
Overall Bank performance is assessed as satisfactory. As noted earlier, Bank identification of the project
was rapid, as required in this emergency situation. Project design was innovative in that Bank budgetary
assistance was provided specifically to support social assistance payments. Disbursements were rapid, and
compensation in cash was highly valued by beneficiaries. To maximize the integrity and accountability of
the project, two independent assessments of efficacy and efficiency were incorporated. Missions were
comprised of staff from Turkey Country Office and Headquarters, and were mounted very quickly to
identify the project. They included staff with pertinent knowledge of the country and social protection
sector, as well as financial management and procurement specialists. Lending was satisfactory.
7.2 Supervision:
Supervision was satisfactory. A mid-term review, in May, 2000, recommended changes in eligibility
criteria and additional effort to begin to upgrade GOT capacity to deal with a disaster such as this, and
both were implemented. Staff visited extensively with field operations of all agencies involved, and also
interviewed beneficiaries. Relations between the GOT and the project team were excellent.
No deviations from any Bank policies or procedures were noted.
7.3 Overall Bank performance:
As noted, overall Bank performance is rated as satisfactory.
Borrower
7.4 Preparation:
Overall Borrower performance was highly satisfactory. Borrower staff worked quickly and effectively to
identify project. In preparation, the GOT designated SSF as primary agency Turkish agency for field
implementation. SSF was the best qualified agency for this difficult assignment, with a nation-wide
network of field offices and an effective framework for distribution of funds.
7.5 Government implenentationi performnance:
Government implementation performance was satisfactory. Government commitment was high, and the
performance of field agencies was very good. When the disaster struck, SSF and the other field agencies
rapidly mobilized a large nuinber of temporary workers from all over the country, as well as computers and
other resources and systems needed to rapidly disburse project funds, while maintaining accountability. It
- 1 0 -



should be noted that project funds were disbursed with minimal deviations from eligibility criteria. When
the mid-term review discovered relatively minor inconsistencies in the way that eligibility criteria were
being applied, the government reviewed and cross-checked the beneficiary rolls, and removed ineligible
individuals.
7.6 Implementing Agency:
Performance of the implementing agencies--the Public Finance General Directorate of the Undersecretariat
of the Treasury, and the Central Bank of Turkey--was satisfactory.
7.7 Overall Borrower peiformance:
Overall Borrower performance was satisfactory.
8. Lessons Learned
The main lessons learned for the ICR were:
*     Better coordination is needed among and within Government agencies. In some areas of
Turkey, television announcements were made about the rental and repair allowances before local
SSF were informed by central SSF staff. Large queues of people formed at the local SSF offices
before the local officials had any official information about the allowances, and it was difficult to
manage the expectations of the crowds in the absence of official instructions.
*     Volunteers played a key role in mobilizing efforts to process applicants for the various
allowances. The Government's efforts to get assistance in cash to earthquake victims were
possible in large measure to the willingness of volunteers to staff the temporary offices and
processing centers of the SSF. In Adapazari, the processing center was staffed entirely by
volunteers. In Izmit, teachers volunteered to work in the processing office since schools were
closed due to the earthquake.
*     The cash allowances were viewed as an important step in helping people cope with the
effects of the earthquake, and to overcome the trauma and to reintegrate into normal life. The
provision of cash allowances were a tangible sign of the Government's efforts to help the victims,
and had a positive impact not only on the material living conditions of recipients, but on their
psychological orientation as well. The cash nature of the benefits was extremely important, both
in terms of meeting the needs of the recipients (the applicants revealed a strong preference for
assistance in cash as preferable to aid in kind) and in the logistics of getting assistance to victims
quickly (which could not have been done if payments were made in kind).
*     The management information system in the SSF should be strengthened, so that it would
be easier to check centrally against duplicate applications and other errors.
*     The amount of the World Bank EERL was not sufficient to cover all the payments made,
and the SSF had to use its own resources to cover the cost of the rental and repair allowances.
This problem became especially acute when the Government extended the rental allowances for
an additional six months (over their original duration of one year). The extensions were not
covered by loan financing.
- 1 1 -



*     Teamwork among the SSF staff, the volunteers, other Government agencies, and in some
areas, non-governmental organizations was critical to successfully set up and implement the
payment of the allowances.
*     One-stop shop was an especially effective way of processing the benefits. In Adapazari, a
"one-stop shop" for the rental and repair allowances was set up in a gymnasium. Applicants were
instructed to bring their damage report to the gymnasium, and while they waited, their documents
were photocopied and their data were entered into the computer system and they were informed
whether they were eligible for an allowance and how to set up their bank account to receive the
payments. As a result of this superior organization, Sakariya province was the first process to
distribute rental allowances on October 1, 2001.
*     On the Bank side, as noted in previous aide-memories, the fast disbursing nature of the
loan (disbursements were made against allowances paid) was extremely important in facilitating
the timely delivery of allowances to earthquake victims.
a     In general, as previously noted in Bank supervision of the EERL, the SSF and the social
insurance agencies (Bag-Kur, SSK, ES) did an exemplary job of setting up field offices,
processing applications, and insuring that applicants received their benefits. A beneficiary
assessment conducted by Istanbul University demonstrated that errors were low and applicants
were very satisfied by their treatment by the authorities and grateful for the assistance received.
Although beyond the boundaries of the EERL project, better preparation for national disasters
and stricter building codes were identified as important next steps for Turkey.

A-PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
From the Emergency Earthquake Recovery Loan of the World Bank, for the
earthquake  victims  of  17  th  August  1999;  197.039  Million  US$
(113..61 3.575.000.000.-TL) from the total amount of loan which is 252.53 Million US$
is transferred for aid by the decree of the Cabinet No:99113484.
National and intemational supports for the earthquake victims helped to
overcome the negative effects of the earthquake.
In this sense, especially the support of Worid Bank had an important role on
fast relieving of people.
For enforcing this type of aid programme of Social Solidarity Fund for the very
first time, Social Solidarity Fund thanks to:
a Undersecretary of Treasury,
• World Bank and its' Representatives.
B-ORGANIZATION AND ACTIONS
Social Solidarity Fund which was established in 1986, helps people who do
not have any income and do not covered by any social security system throughout
country.
The main goal of Social Solidarity Fund is to prevent poverty and to provide
food, health, education, accomodation projects and some other benefits for these
people. Besides, SSF also helps people who are victims of some natural disasters.
After the 17th August earthquake, a new group is constituted within Social
Solidarity Fund for helping earthquake victims. It was called 'Earthquake Study
Group' and provided with all necessary equipment. A new phone line is provided for
fast communication with earthquake region.
Besides, necessary resources is transferred to Social Solidarity Foundations in
the Region for hiring new personnel and new technical equipment.
Other than this, certain amount of money is sent to other foundations near the
Region since they can reach and deliver aid in kind.
For the people who want to migrate to other places, resources are transferred
for their transportation and other kind of needs in new settlements.
With the Cabinet Decision 1999(13484; the types of aids and the amounts are
determined and Social Solidarity Foundations are informed about these informations.

People were applied to the Foundations, their applications are examined and
their names are listed and sent to Social Solidarity Fund and 'to the Banks authorized
for payments. Bank cards were given to get the money.
C-EVALUATION
First of all, this disaster was the biggest one for Turkey. Since the disaster was
occured in a big and a widespread area, it was really difficult to reach everybody on
time and to get necessary documents.
At the same time, many people who work in Foundations and other public
offices were also effected from the earthquake. So, this had a negative effect on
working conditions.
For the purpose of helping earthquake victims total amount of 197.039.709
US$ is transferred by the date of 18 April 2001.
This resource is used for Accomodation, Repair, Death and Disability benefits.
Employment benefits and emergency aids were paid by Social Solidarity
Fund's own resources.
From the Worid Bank resources, 150.352.262 US$ is used for Accomodation
Benefits; 26.813.357 US$ is used for Repair Benefits, 19.874.090 US$ is used for
Death and Disability Benefits.
Related with the World Bank Loan, primarily it can be said that the amount of
the credit which was given to SSF could be higher than this since the accomodation
benefits are extended for six months and employment benefits were given by SSF.
Other than this, the amounts which are transferred could only be used for
determined caLegories. Since it was not possible to estimate types of benefits and
number of people who will apply.
In this type of big disasters, it is impossible to predict the application number
and type of aids. So it would be more effective to have the flexibility to transfer money
between the categories, or to keep the money in one account and distribute it
according to the aid categories and number of applicants.
Repending on our experiences about impacts of benefits,
* Disability benefits could also be paid for 3rd degree disabilities and the
amount of benefits for 1t and 2"d degree disabilities could be higher than the amount
paid.
* Related with the repair benefits, the benefits could be given to renter and
owner of house in different categories. Such as repair benefit could be given only for
of thc '.Ouse. For the benef ' c furniture damage or moving expenses could .b gihon.

The experiences we have had during this earthquake showed us the necessity
of having a better coordination and technical infrastructure for new disasters.
From World Bank Loan, 30.000 US$ is reserved for strenghtening the
administrative structure of Sociai Solidarity Fund and to have an operational manual
for emergency programmes. The studies had already started and a contract is
signed between Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Social Solidarity Fund. The draft
report has been delivered by the firm. The studies for approval of the report is
continuing.
Regarding with the meeting held on 26th April 2001 in Undersecretariat of
Treasury, Social Solidarity Fund asked to Central Bank of Turkey to transfer the rest
of tne money from special account to SSF's on 4e May 2001.
After the completion of the report and manual SSF will transfer the money to
Pricewater House Coopers accounts.
A copy of last report and operational manual will be sent to Undersecretariat of
Treasury.
