REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO CORPORACION FINANCIERA DE DESARROLLO (COFIDE)
WITH THE GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF PERU FOR AN
INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recomendation on a proposed loan
to Corporacion Financiera de Desarrollo (COFIDE) with the guarantee of the
Republic of Peru for the equivalent of US$35.0 million to help finance an
industrial credit project. The interest rate on the proposed loan would
be 8.7 percent per annum. COFIDE, in turn would relend the loan proceeds in
foreign exchange at an interest rate of no less than 11 percent and with terms
of up to 15 years including grace periods of up to 3 years. Amortization of
the proposed loan would be based on the aggregate of the amortization schedules
of COFIDE's subloans.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        A report entitled "Economic Position and Prospects of Peru" (No. 655-
PE) was distributed to the Executive Directors on March 3, 1975. Country data
sheets are attached as Annex I.
3.        Since 1968 the Government has followed a development strategy in
which economic growth is linked to a transformation of the society to achieve
broader popular participation in the country's economic, social and political
life, thus addressing one of the most serious problems of Peru's economy and
society -- the sharp differences in wealth and opportunities between income
classes and geographical regions. A new government headed by General Morales
Bermudez, which took office in August 1975, has been reassessing the progress
made since 1968 and has publicly acknowledged the difficulties that have
arisen during the past eight years in the onerous task of reconciling growth,
financial stability and better income distribution. The main problems that
arose were a contraction in domestic savings, particularly in the public
sector, a fall in efficiency in the productive sectors and a retrenchment in
the level of investment by the private sector. The President has stated the
need for important modifications in policies that would leave the basic long
term objectives unchanged, but would call for a more gradual approach to
reforms of the economic and social system and would emphasize measures that
increase domestic savings, encourage private sector investment and improve
efficiency in production.
4.        GDP grew at an annual rate above 7 percent during 1970/74 but fell
to less than 3 percent in 1975. Gross domestic investment rose from 13 per-
cent to almost 19 percent of GDP between 1970 and 1975, largely because of
the increase of public and private investment in mining and petroleum. How-
ever, as consumption also grew faster than GDP and heavy losses were incurred
by public enterprises marketing imported petroelum and foodstuffs, gross

national savings fell to less than 8 percent of GNP. The excessive growth of
aggregate demand combined with the sharp rise in Peru's import prices since
1973 resulted in an acceleration of inflation -- from an average annual rate
of 7.2 percent during 1969-73 to over 24 percent in 1975 -- and an increase
in thie deficit of the balance of payments on current account from 0.5 to 11
percent of GDP between 1972 and 1975. Net long-term capital inflows rose from
US$110 million in 1972 to US$840 million in 1974 and allowed a US$275 million
increase in net international reserves in spite of the widened resource gap.
In 1975, although net long-term capital inflows totalled an estimated US$1.1
billion, they were not sufficient to finance the current account deficit and
net international reserves fell from US$680 million in December 1974 to around
US$127 million in December 1975. Gross international reserves equalled $470
million at that time and were equivalent to less than three weeks of merchan-
dise imports.
5.        During 1975 the Government approved a series of tax and price
measures to reduce the excessive growth of aggregate demand and to stimulate
the growth of food output and exports but these were insufficent to reverse
the deteriorating financial trends. Additional measures were taken in
January 1976, including increases in taxes and official prices and cuts in
public expenditures, but Peru's financial position continued to worsen during
the first half of the year. Export earnings remained depressed mainly because
of a decline in international prices for Peruvian goods; reportedly volume was
also low because exporters were waiting for better world prices and were also
expecting a further change in the dollar parity of the Sol, which had been
devalued by about 14 percent in September 1975. On the other hand, imports
continued to grow, although less rapidly than last year, and the current
account deficit totalled over US$700 million during January-June 1976, equiv-
alent to around 8 percent of GDP, somewhat less than the 11 percent reached in
1975. Long-term capital inflows were substantially lower than in previous
years mainly because of a decline in private direct foreign investment and
lower disbursements of foreign medium and long-term loans partly due to the
reluctance of commercial banks to provide additional non-project credits.
Moreover, short-term capital outflows increased substantially during the
semester, caused mainly by the general uncertainty and the combination of
increasingly negative interest rates in real terms and growing expectations of
a substantial devaluation. Net international reserves fell during January-May
by over US$525 million to a negative level of around US$400 million; the
foreign currency holdings of the banking system were almost exhausted in spite
of US$212 million of IMF assistance which included the first credit tranche
and the use of the compensatory and oil facilities.
6.         On the domestic side the public sector deficit also continued to
widen rapidly. The Central Government deficit was caused by a combination
of rapid growth of both current and capital expenditures resulting from
inflation and very low growth of current revenues due mainly to the sharp
fall in income tax payments by the mining sector and the declining imports
subject to duty. The latter underlines two important weaknesses of the tax
system: its dependence on foreign trade and its low elasticity to change in



nominal GDP.   Although the income of many public enterprises rose substan-
tially because of price measures taken in January, the combined deficit of
all state enterprises remained large because of the operating losses of the
steel and fishing companies, combined with low surpluses of the mining
companies and large cost overruns on investment projects, mainly in the
petroleum sector.
7.        A series of drastic measures were taken in May and June of 1976
to cut down the growthl of aggregate demand, restore balance of payments
equilibrium and reduce inflation. On May 19 additional tax measures were
introduced that included mainly increases in sales, cigarette and automobile
taxes, and a reduction of exemptions of import duties on capital goods as a
first step in rationalizing and reducing the heavy fiscal cost of industrial
incentives. At the end of May the statutory ceiling on interest rates was
abolished and replaced by maximum rates that can be changed by administrative
regulation. The maximum lending rates rose from 14 percent to 19 percent,
while the maximum rates paid on deposits rose from 7 to 12 percent. Then on
June 28, a further package of corrective measures was approved consisting
mainly of: a devaluation of the Sol from S/.45 to S/.65 per U.S. dollar, a
15 percent tax on traditional exports and large increases in taxes on petro-
leum products; a cut in public expenditures; substantial increases in the
prices of petroleum products and foodstuffs; and the freezing of all wages
till the end of 1976 after an adjustment of around 10-15 percent to ease the
impact of the other measures on the cost of living. The May-June measures ar(
(x)pected to increase public savings by 2.8 percent of GDP in one semester and
reduce the overall public sector deficit from around 11 percent of GDP in 1975
to around 7 percent in 1976. This cut, combined with the devaluation, a
fall in real wages, the increase in interest rates and tight credit policies,
is expected to result in a sharp contraction of imports and a reduction in the
current balance of payments deficit from 11 percent of GDP in 1975 to around
5.5 percent in the second semester of 1976 and less than 4.8 percent in 1977.
As a direct result of the corrective measures taken, prices will rise 28
percent during the second semester of this year, but the Government expects
inflation to fall to 10-15 percent during 1977 compared to an estimated 40
percent this year. As a complement of the stabilization package the Govern-
ment obtained in early December US$330 million of balance of payments support
loans from North American and European Commercial banks.
8.         Besides moving forcefully towards financial stabilization, the
Government has been approving a series of important measures with far reach-
ing long-term development consequences. The drive towards eliminating the
distortions in relative prices has made considerable progress. The Govern-
ment publicly announced its determination to maintain the exchange rate at
realistic levels. In September frequent mini-devaluations were started; by
December 2 the dollar parity had reached S/.68. The Government also intends
to follow a more flexible interest rate policy in the future and eventually
bring the rates to positive levels in real terms. Although the maximum rates
are still negative, the Government maintains that it would be inappropriate
to increase the rates further since the inflation is expected to fall in 1977.



- 4 -
However, should inflation remain over 15 percent in 1977, the Government
intends to review the interest rate level to ensure that its goals of achiev-
ing real levels is attained. Other price controls are gradually being relaxed.
9.         Priority is now given to increasing efficiency in the productive
system and real efforts to restore confidence and dynamism in the private
sector are being made. President Morales has declared that the State should
di'est itself of some of the nationalized enterprises.     The first measure,
taken in July, was to return the fishmeal fishing fleet to the private sector.
Participation of the private sector in petroleum exploration and medium scale
mining develpment is now being encouraged and the Industrial Community Legisla-
tion is being modified (see para. 22 and 24 below). In the agricultural
sector a new massive program to support the medium and small farmers (owning
more than 3 hectares) is being launched and more attention is being given to
the management and labor problems in the cooperatives. Moreover, further
efforts to prepare rural development projects benefitting the poorer groups
and to provide more infrastructure in rural areas are being made. Early in
October the Government also acknowledged for the first time the need to reduce
the population growtlh rate and is now developing a deliberate population
policy. Finally, the pruning of the public investment program to a more
manageable size is under way and a complete reorganization of public admin-
istration has been announced.
10.       Total public sector external debt (outstanding and disbursed) more
than tripled between 1970 and 1975--from US$0.85 billion to US$2.67 billion--
and average terms deteriorated markedly. Average maturities of new commit-
ments fell from 10.7 years in 1971 to 5.6 years in 1975 as a result both
of heavy borrowinig for non-project purposes from commercial banks and the low
level of lending from official sources. Between 1970-72 and 1975 the share of
net disbursements coming from commercial banks rose from less than 30 to 50
percent whiile thie share from official sources fell from 70 percent to less
than 36 percent.
11.       The public debt service ratio rose from 23 percent in 1974 to an
estimated 26 percent in 1975 reflecting both a sharp increase in interest
payments and the decline in the value of merchandise exports. During 1976
the public debt service ratio is expected to fall to 22 percent because of
the recovery in export earnings in the second semester of the year and a
small decrease in debt service payments. However, given the very serious
foreign liquidity squeeze the country is now going through, this level of debt
service will place a heavy burden on the balance of payments. The Government
has committed itself to give first priority in foreign exchange allocation to
debt service payments. During 1977/80 the public debt service ratio may rise
further to 27-28 percent, but would decline in the 1980s if the Government
is successful in obtaining improved lending terms in future years.



12.       Although Peru is a country with serious constraints to its develop-
ment efforts it has a large untapped resource potential. The Government
is trying to accelerate growth while broadening the participation of the
population in the development process. It has been caught by some of the
unavoidable effects of the structural transformation, by the negative effects
of some errors and inadequacies in policies (generally now recognized and
gradually being corrected), and by unfavorable external developments. Conse-
quently, the present situation is difficult. The Government is aware of
these difficulties and is taking action to resolve them. Improvements in
the balance of payments position during 1977 and thereafter will depend on:
(a) continued efforts to increase savings, contain import growth and reduce
dependence on foreign commercial borrowing; (b) reducing dependence on imported
petroleum with the completion of the oil pipeline and with additional petro-
leum exploration; and (c) increasing export volume with the timely completion
of mining projects now under way and the expansion of nontraditional exports.
13.       In the longer run, besides restoring equilibrium to the country's
finances and raising the level of savings, the development strategy will
have to focus on increasing the efficiency of resource allocation -- parti-
cularly in the industrial sector --, on diversifying exports to reduce
vulnerability to sharp changes in world prices of primary commodities, and
on developing more effective ways to attack the poverty problem. In the
agricultural sector, the Government is taking action to improve management
capacity and efficiency in the cooperative sector, stimulate investment
in the private medium size farms, and accelerate the transfer of technology
and inputs to the small farmers. However, since the potential of expansion
in agriculture is limited, and mining expansion will not absorb much labor
and since the future of fisheries is highly uncertain, the long-term growth
of the economy will depend mainly on the industrial sector and (to a much
lesser extent) on tourism. To promote industrial growth, the efficiency
and international competitiveness of the sector will have to be increased
primarily through changes in the incentive policy mix -- less protection,
more selective and lower fiscal incentives, and a realistic exchange rate.
The recent changes in policy discussed above represent significant progress on
these issues. Concerning the poverty problem, important elements of the
Government strategy include increasing labor absorption in the modern sectors
of the economy, transferring technology and basic services to the tradi-
tional sectors, and developing institutional mechanisms that promote self-
help among the poorer groups. (The project in Lima and Arequipa slum areas
which is supported by the recent Sites and Services Loan--PE 1283--is a good
example of this strategy).
14.       On the assumption that the Government will continue its financial
stabilization policies and make further progress in laying the basis for
rapid and more balanced development, Peru remains creditworthy for Bank
lending. The Bank, both as a lender and as a chairman of the Consultative
Group, will continue to monitor developments closely.

PART II - BANK OPERATIONS IN PERU
l3ank Operations
15.       The Bank has made 31 Loans in Peru for a total amount of US$492.2
million, net of cancellations; of these, 23 loans, totalling US$213.1 million,
were fully disbursed as of October 31, 1976. About 45 percent of Bank lending
to Peru has been for transportation (mainly highways and ports) 21 percent for
electric power, 16 percent for agriculture, 9 percent for mining and industry,
and also about 9 percent for an education project and a site and services
project. Project execution has been generally satisfactory. Annex II contains
a statement of Bank loans as of October 31, 1976, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.
IFC Operations
16.       IFC commitments to date have been about US$24.0 million (US$15 mil-
lion to Southern Peru Copper Corporation for the Cuajone Copper mining project
and the remainder to industry) of which US$15.3 million is held by the
Corporation. A summary statement of IFC investments as of November 30, 1976,
is presented in Annex II.
Bank Strategy
17.       The main objectives of Bank lending to Peru have been to aid in
(a) the creation of a physical and social infrastructure capable of sustain-
ing and fostering the evolution of the nation's productive capacity; (b) the
expansion of productive capacity in crucial sectors; and (c) the consolidation
of structtural and institutional changes now under way, particularly land and
educational reforms.   In the past Bank lending has been concentrated on infra-
structure in the transportation and power sectors; the most recent loans in
these fields were made for the Transandean Corridor Project in May 1976 and
for a power project in the l.ima area in September 1976.    Our emphasis is now
shifting to the more directly productive fields - mining, agriculture and
industry - to aid Peru in reducing her current balance of payments problem
and to strengthen institutions carrying out Peru's economic and social reforms.
The recent: US$40 million mining loan, for instance, was designed mainly to
expand production for export and strengthen the effectiveness of the public
mining ent:erprise, CENTROMIN, particularly in project planning and execution.
The indust:rial credit project now being recommended is designed to expand
production for export and substitute economically for imports while improving
the project evaluation capability of Peru's national development bank, COFIDE.
Future Bank lending would give high priority to agriculture to help increase
food production and raise the standard of living of the rural population and
to strength:en the reLatively weak ministries and agencies operating in this
field. An irrigation rehabilitation project to expand production of both
export crops and agricultural products now being imported, as well as to aid
in consolidating the land reform program and strengthening agricultural
institutions in the coastal zone, will be negotiated shortly and a second
agricultural credit project has been appraised.



Bank staff and the Bank/FAO Cooperative Program are assisting the Government
in the preparation of projects for rural development in the mountain region.
Preparatory work is proceeding on other projects in the water supply and
transport sectors. The Bank also expects to continue to play a role in coor-
dinating external assistance and being a catalyst for new sources of funds
for major investment projects through the mechanism of the Consultative
Group.
PART III - THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Growth and Structure
18.       Value added in manufacturing, which currently accounts for about
27 percent of GDP, has been growing faster than 7 percent per year since 1960.
Manufacturing employment, on the other hand, has been growing about 4 percent
per year, and the sector employs only slightly more than 5 percent of the
labor force. Some 74 percent of value added and 76 percent of employment in
manufacturing (excluding fish products) are concentrated in the Lima-Callao
metropolitan area.
19.       Peru's traditional import substitution policy has tended to favor
consumer goods for the domestic market, often in the form of mere "finishing"
of imported inputs. Despite increased emphasis since 1968 on production of
basic and intermediate goods, consumer goods still account for more than
half of manufacturing value added. Such traditional industries as food
processing, beverages, tobacco and textiles are of particular importance.
The limitations of the domestic market have constrained the possibilities for
product specialization in individual plants, as well as for the manufacturing
of parts, components and accessories in separate establishments. The manu-
facturing sector consequently is relatively unintegrated and shows a heavy
degree of import dependence.
Financing of Industry
2(.        At present the Peruvian banking system includes the Central Bank,
6 state-owned development banks in the industrial, mining, agricultural and
housing fields, 17 commercial banks, several private financieras and the
state-owned Banco de la Nacion, which is the main depository of public funds
and controls the reserve requirements of commercial banks. The most important
sources of long-term industrial financing are two Government banks. One is
the Development Finance Corporation (COFIDE), which is the Government's
principal development finance institution, assisting not only state enter-
prises but also private and other types of firms operating in Peru. The other
is the Industrial Bank of Peru (BIP), which lends mainly to small and medium
sized private firms, providing them with both short-term working capital loans
and longer-term investment financing. The commercial banks are the main
institutional source of short- and medium-term industrial finance in Peru,
providing local currency loans and arranging foreign credit.



-8-
Industrial Policies
21.       Following the change of Government in 1968, Peru's industrial
policies have been focused on linking production and economic growth with
broader participation of the population in the country's economic, social and
political life and on1 redressing what was considered to be excessive concen-
tration on consumer goods production. In an effort to achieve these object-
ives, the state assumed an active role in the economic management and a number
of foreign-owned industries in strategic sectors were nationalized.
22.       To refonr the dlistribution of wealth and income, the Government also
embarked on a fundamental transformation of the economy's ownership and
management structure by instituting employees' participation schemes in owner-
ship, profits and management. These new arrangements have been of two types.
One, called "reformed private" sector, involves the transfer of a specified
portion of the annual profits of all private industrial enterprises above a
prescribed minimum size (those with gross annual incomes of more than S/.25
million) to their workers in the form of shares until they acquire 50 percent
of the firm's capital, and a corresponding number of seats on the Board.
In addition, the workers receive 10 percent of profits in cash. The Indus-
trial Community Law which established this sector is now being revised to
limit distribution of profits to one-third of the share capital of the enter-
prise in the form of special shares which would still allow for representation
at the Board but would leave control of the enterprise to the common stock-
holders. The other innovation was the Social Property sector, constituting
the establishment of enterprises owned by workers as distinct from state or
private ownership. Under this arrangement the workers control most of the
operating, marketing and financial decisions through their elected repre-
sentatives. In creating Social Property enterprises priority will be given
to labor intensive industries, particularly in rural areas, in an effort to
combat unemployment. Thus far only a few Social Property enterprises have
begun operations but about 60 are being formed.
23.        In order to foster inclustrial development within its overall reform
objectives the Government has been giving high priority to selected categories
of industries considered basic for the integrated development of the economy,
mainly in the public sector, and to projects promoting geographical decen-
tralization of development.   The Government also established a complex indus-
trial policy framework involving fiscal incentives, import restrictions,
concessional financing terms and other subsidy measures.     Spurred by these
incentives and a growing domestic demand resulting from income redistribution
policies, industrial outputt increased rapidly in recent years and the value
added by the industrial sector grew at an annual real rate of 8.6 percent
during 1968/74.
24.       While total investment has been increasing in recent years, private
investment has been largely confined to the reinvestment of profits because
of uncertainty regarding the Government's posture toward the private sector.
Recent policy statements by President Morales Bermudez have emphasized the
role of the private sector in Peru's economic development. In addition, the



- 9 -
President has announced that the Government will dispose of some of the enter-
prises it now owns. The first such measure, decreed on July 20, 1976, provides
for the return to the private sector of the anchovy fishing fleet which was
nationalized three years ago. In addition offshore and eastern jungle areas,
which had been reserved for development by the national petroleum company,
PETROPERU, have again been opened up to private foreign companies to prospect
for and exploit petroleum. The Government is also now stressing that social
property enterprises are not to substitute for but to complement other forms
of ownership.
25.       The Government has also recognized the need to revise its basic
strategy for the development of Peruvian industry, particularly since, in-
stead of increasing its integration and independence as hoped for, the manu-
facturing sector has been becoming excessively dependent on imports and thus
on other sectors of the economy to finance its foreign exchange needs, there-
by aggravating Peru's balance of payments situation. Governmental authorities
concerned with industrial policy understand the need to replace gradually the
present rigid priority and incentive system with a consistent and flexible
industrial strategy to take full advantage of Peru's comparative advantages.
Consequently, they also increasingly appreciate the importance of economic
evaluation of projects to ensure efficient resource allocation. As explained
below, the proposed loan would help in this regard through the application
of economic efficiency tests designed to select projects for financing which
utilize the country's resources effectively.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background
26.       The proposed loan to COFIDE would be the Bank's first DFC-type
operation in Peru and would help finance the foreign exchange component of
a wide range of manufacturing projects, as well as others in the mineral,
agricultural processing and tourism fields. The project was initially
appraised in October 1974 and was reappraised in March and December 1975.
Negotiations were held in Washington, D.C. on November 15-19, 1976, with
the COFIDE delegation composed of Messrs. Seiner, Romero and Trovarelli
and the Government represented by Mr. Montoya. The Appraisal Report (No.
1195-PE dated December 7, 1976) is being circulated separately to the
Executive Directors. A loan and Project Summary is attached as Annex III.
Project Objectives
27.       The project's main objectives are to:
(1) finance high-priority investment projects. In order to help over-
come Peru's present balance of payments constraint financing would be provided
for an expected 35-50 projects to expand exports and substitute efficiently
for imports.



- 10 -
(2) strengthen COFIDE's effectiveness. Through a direct lending
relation with COFIDE, we expect to strengthen COFIDE's overall effectiveness
as a development Bank. In this connection particular attention would be given
to supplementing the tests presently utilized by COFIDE in evaluating projects
by economic analysis in order to improve COFIDE's resource allocation ability.
Although economic tests would be mandatory only for projects financed from the
loan, it is expected that they will be used more widely within COFIDE and for
reviewing the investment plans of other entities, once their usefulness has
been demonstrated. Funds will be made available under the project for train-
ing in techniques of project appraisal.
The Borrower and Project Management
28.       In addition to carrying out the usual lending functions of a DFC,
COFIDE has a heavy but not yet fully defined responsibility for state enter-
prises. By law it holds the shares of several major public enterprises, but
a final decision is yet to be made whether this will continue to be done on
behalf of Government or whether COFIDE will assume the character of a conglom-
erate with both ownership and financial responsibility for them. In this
situation of considerable uncertainty regarding both COFIDE's future role and
the magnitude of its financial risks, an arrangement has been worked out to
segregate the proceeds of the loan from COFIDE's other operations and to
obtain from Government an explicit assurance of financial backing for COFIDE
(Section 2.02 of the Guarantee Agreement). The loan proceeds, together with
the local currency counterpart funds to be provided by COFIDE, would be
channelled to sub-borrowers through a separate account (the Fund). The Fund
would follow its own policy statement and, since it would be endowed with its
own resources, it would operate with a certain degree of financial independence
from COFIDE's other operations. A maximum debt:equity ratio of 5:1 would
apply to COFIDE and its financial subsidiaries.
29.       Loans financed with the Fund's resources would be appraised by
COFIDE's regular staff. Personnel would not be assigned specifically to the
Fund but COFIDE will be obligated to maintain qualified staff in sufficient
numbers to assure adequate appraisal of subprojects. COFIDE has a competent
management and an experienced technical staff whose evaluations need to be
strengthened mainly by the systematic application of economic criteria.
Therefore, COFIDE's normal procedures for processing projects would be ex-
panded to include a calculation of the economic impact of each subproject.
Subloans would be made on the basis of a detailed evaluation of the technical,
management, market, financial and economic aspects of each project and of
the creditworthiness of the recipient enterprise.
30.       Subprojects would be selected on the basis of their economic effi-
ciency and loans would be available to all types of enterprises operating in
Peru. However, no more than US$10.5 million (30 percent of the proposed loan
amount) could be relent to enterprises in the Social Property sector. This
limitation has been established because the Social Property type of enterprise
is still in an experimental stage and COFIDE has had little experience with
it. For the same reason all subloans to Social Property enterprises would



- 11 -
require Bank approval. A "free-limit" of US$500,000 would apply to other
subprojects which would ensure Bank review of a sufficient number of subloans.
Finally, to avoid excessive concentration in relending Bank funds, a maximum
limit of US$4.0 million per subloan and sub-borrower would apply (Section 2.02
of the Loan Agreement).
Lending Terms
31.       The loan proceeds would be relent from the fund at a fixed rate
of interest of no less than 11 percent with the sub-borrowers bearing the
foreign exchange risk. COFIDE would receive up to 1.5 percent as an
administration fee. The remainder of the spread between the cost of Bank
funds and the ultimate relending rate would accrue to the Fund and would be
available to finance training programs for project analysts and for techni-
cal assistance in promoting and implementing small-scale industries, mainly
in the Social Property sector (Sections 3.02 and 3.03 of the Loan Agreement).
This component of the project would complement the assistance given to such
industries under the recent Sites and Services loan (Loan PE-1283). It would
also provide us with valuable experience for a planned loan for small scale
industries.
32.       Subloan terms are expected to range between 5 and 15 years, includ-
ing grace periods ranging from 1 to 3 years. The usual composite amortiza-
tion schedule for Bank loans for DFCs would apply. The terminal date for
submission of subproject proposals under the loan would be June 30, 1979;
the closing date for disbursements June 30, 1981.
33.       The interest rate and other terms on the lending of local currency
through the Fund would follow COFIDE's general pattern. In line with the
recent upward revision of the structure of interest rates in Peru, summarized
in paragraphs 6 and 7 above, all of COFIDE's local currency relending rates
have recently been raised by 3.5 percent. As a result the bulk of COFIDE's
local currency lending is now being made within the range of 11.5-15.5 percent,
with the precise rate dependent on the priority of the enterprise involved.
The Government intends to keep the general interest rate structure under
review, as indicated in paragraph 7 above, and COFIDE is expected to adjust
its interest rates whenever necessary to meet conditions in the capital market
and to give it a reasonable profit. Specifically, the Government and COFIDE
undertake to review periodically with the Bank the adequacy of interest raL:es
and progress towards positive real levels of interest. The first such consul-
tation will take place no later than one year after signing of the loan
(Section 4.07 of the Loan Agreement and Section 3.02 of the Guarantee Agree-
ment).
Procurement and Disbursement
34.       Subloans would cover up to 100 percent of the import component of
subprojects. In most cases, they would finance the direct foreign exchange
cost of equipment imports -- including goods purchased "off-the-shelf" from



- 12 -
domestic distributors, provided c.i.f. prices can be established. Other-
wise, 50 percent of the local invoice price would be reimbursed. In the case
of projects for industrial construction or tourism, disbursements of Bank
funds would be made for 35 percent of documented expenditures (unless a higher
foreign exchange component of a specific project can be established). These
percentages would be equivalent to the estimated foreign exchange component
of eligible projects. COFIDE would satisfy itself that the goods and ser-
vices financed are adequate in quality and competitive in price.
Project Justification and Risks
35.       The project would aid Peru in reducing its balance of payments
constraint and generate additional production and employment by financing
some 35 to 50 development projects in a wide range of productive subsectors.
The guidelines according to which the economic rate of return will be calcu-
lated require a special justification for subprojects with a return below 10
percent. Most significantly, it is hoped that the use of systematic economic
tests in project decision-making will spread more widely in COFIDE and other
government agencies. In summary, the proposed loan would open a direct
relationship between the Bank and COFIDE and contribute to strengthening
COFIDE's effectiveness as Peru's major development bank, mainly by improving
its resource allocation and mobilization capacity, which, in turn should
indirectly help to improve Peru's productive sector development planning and
investment decision-making process.
36.       Great uncertainties currently exist in the industrial sector in Peru
because of changing and evolving institutions and policies. However, two
special provisions of the loan are designed to insulate the project from the
financial risks involved. One is the Fund arrangement, summarized in paragraph
28, containing operational and financial provisions which would protect the
project to a certain degree from the effects of a significant change in
COFIDE's role. The other is the Government's explicit financial backing which
assures that COFIDE will continue to be a financially viable institution even
if it is transformed into a holding company for large governmental enterprises.
The limited experience with the Social Property concept is taken into account
through the requirement that the Bank review all subprojects to Social Property
enterprises and through the limit on total lending to them.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
37.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and COFIDE, the draft
Guarantee Agreement between the Republic of Peru and the Bank, the Report of
the Committee provided for in Article III, Section 4(iii) of the Articles of
Agreement and the text of the draft resolution approving the proposed loan
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.



- 13 -
38.       The draft Loan and Guarantee Agreements conform to the normal pattern
for loans to development finance companies except for (a) the requirement to
establish the Fund through which the proceeds of the loan will be channelled;
(b) an undertaking by the Guarantor to provide COFIDE with the flnds necessary
for carrying on its operations; and (c) the limitation of the Bank's negative
pledge clause--which is required if the Borrower is not the Government--to
COFIDE and its financial subsidiaries. Normally, this clause applies to all
the subsidiaries of the Borrower and, according to it, the Borrower undertakes
not to create a lien on its assets or the assets of its subsidiaries as
security for any debt unless it grants an equivalent lien to the Bank. This
latter change was introduced in recognition of COFIDE's special role as a
holding company for state enterprises. An additional condition of effective-
ness would be the establishment of the Fund (Section 6.01 of the Loan Agree-
ment). As in previous loans to or to be guaranteed by the Republic of Peru,
the Republic of Peru must formally approve the legal instruments therefore
by means of a Supreme Decree to be issued after Board approval and before
loan signature.
39.        I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the Articles
of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATIONS
40.        I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION 1/
Loan 706-PE:  Road Reconstruction Project:   US$30 million Loan of September 14,
1970; Effective Date: October 26, 1970; Closing Date: March 31, 1977
This Loan was signed only three and a half months after the earthquake
in the Callejon de Huaylas. However, the identification, feasibility study and
final engineering of the roads to be improved have taken much longer than expected
because of a too optimistic assessment at the time of appraisal, because of
administrative and coordination difficulties in connection with the on-going
decentralization of the Central Government, and because of problems with the
consultants engaged to study and supervise the project. These problems were over-
come and the project is now expected to be completed by the revised Closing Date
of the Loan.
_/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses in
project execution.

IEff6ctiv,.Dat,eK'.tMarch 5y'1974.;- Closing Date: June 30, 1979
This Loan became effective on March 5, 1974. Serious initial delays
were caused by -a'di~i"ni'strativ& difficulties with the,Project Unit and late
appointment of counterpart staff to the consultants who were to define curricula
for the ESEPs (Escuelas Superiores de Ensenanza Profesional). The change of
status of the Project Unit which has been upgraded to the rank of Directorate
General and the strengthened management of the project have markedly improved
the prospects for efficient implementation of the project. At present 20 basic
cycle school designs have been approved by the Bank and construction contracts
are being bid. ESEPs are now being designed and are expected to be contracted
during 1977.
Loan 1025-PE: Sixth Highway Project; US$26 million Loan of July 1, 1974;
Effective Date: August 21. 1974; Closing Date: June 30, 1978
Bids for construction works were invited in October 1974, on the basis
of the official cost estimates, but contractors failed to respond. After an
upward revision of the cost estimates new invitations to bid were issued in
March 1975. Contractors response this time has been positive and bids for all
sections have been submitted and contracts were awarded in August 1975.
Project implementation is about one year behind schedule.

schedule. Following recent supervision missions it is expected that project
implementation will be accelerated to the projected rythm.

PERU
COFIDE INDUSTRIAL CREDIT PROJECT
LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower:             Corporacion Financiera de Desarrollo (COFIDE).
Guarantor:           Republic of Peru
Amount:              US$35.0 million equivalent
Terms:               Repayable over a period of 17 years in conformity
with the composite amortization schedule of the
subloans financed from the proceeds of the loan;
interest at 8.7% per year.
Ree1iding Terms:     Proceeds of the loan will be relent to COFIDE's
borrowers at an annual rate of not less than 11%
with a maximum maturity of 15 years and a grace
period of not more than 3 years. Sub-borrowers would
bear the foreign exchange risk. Not more than
$4.0 million could be lent to one sub-borrower.
Project Description: The loan would help cover foreign exchange costs of
economically efficient manufacturing and processing
projects with a favorable impact on the country's
balance of payments. Because of their potential for
earning foreign currency, tourism projects would also
be eligible.  Beneficiaries would include mostly
medium and large enterprises regardless of their form
of ownership (this would include state owned, reformed
private, private and Social Property Enterprises).
However, no more than 30% of the loan ($10.5 million
equivalent) could be re-lent to Social Property
Enterprises reflecting the lack of experience with
this form of self-managed firm. For the same reason
subloans to Social Property Enterprises would require
Bank approval, whereas a "free-limit" of US$500,000
would apply to other subprojects.
