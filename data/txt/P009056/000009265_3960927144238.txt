MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMDATION OF THE P
OF THE lNTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
FOR AN AGROINDUSTRY PROJECT
1.        The following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed loan to
the Republic of Turkey for US$150 million equivalent is submitted for
approval. The proposed loan would have a term of 17 years, including a
five-year grace period, and the Bank's standard variable interest rate. The
Government would onlend the proceeds of the Bank loan (excluding $6.7 million
for a fisheries survey and a marketing training component) to participating
credit institutions (PCIs), including the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (TCZB),
Balk Bank, and the Industrial Investment and Credit Bank (SYmB), and any other
bank which may be deemed eligible at a later date. Aside from $0.5 million
for technical assistance to the PCIs, proceeds of the loans to the PCIs would
be onlent to finance private agroindustry investments.
2.        Background.  Agroindustry is the single largest subsector in
Turkey's manufacturing sector, contributing 30% of manufacturing output, and
19% of the sector's exports. Much of the agroindustry capacity was developed
prior to 198G, during a period when Turkey was following, an import
substitution industrial development strategy.  Since these industries acquired
foreign debt at an overvalued exchange rate, assuming continuation of policies
of nominal domestic interest rates and import protection, many were unprepared
for the stabilization policies of the 1980s based upon realistic exchange
rates, positive interest rates, and a more open economy. High inflation has
led to severe decapitalization, while high real interest rates have caused a
scarcity of investment capital, leading to a rapid increase in short-term
debt, high financial charges, and reduced profitability. Some enterprises
were able to shift direction and regain a measure of financial health through
exporting. Agroindustry exports have grown at an average of 152 per year over
the past ten years, and exports of particular products (olive oil, fruit
juices, tomato paste, and fresh and processed fruits and vegetables) are
projected to grow at even higher rates. However, many other firms, did not
have the managerial ability in such areas as marketing and product quality, or
the financial strength to cope satisfactorily with the changed circumstances.
Much of the industry is still facing serious financial problems, and is not in
a position to take advantage of opportunities for exports and growth.
3.        ProjectLekves.  The agroindustry subsector in Turkey has the
potential to increase production for both domestic and export markets.
Increasing output by increasing capacity utilization in existing plants is in
most cases more economic than by constructing new plants. Thus, the primary
objective of the project is to provide the needed financial resources to
existing enterprises which, under stronger management, will revitalize
existing capacity, thus increasing output, employment and foreign exchange



-2-
earnings. However, construction of new capacity would also be an objective in
the case of products which offer prospects of high capacity utilization or
where existing capacity is either unsuitable or has become obsolescent in the
face of technological change.
4.        ProjeIt DesKioon.  The proposed project would have the following
components:
(i) credit lines totalling $142.8 million equivalent to the participating
credit institutions (PCIs) for on-lending as subloans to cover the
direct and indirect foreign exchange costs of private sector
agroindustry subprojects which are financially and economically
viable. Permanent working capital in connection with investment
subprojects would also be eligible for financing;
(ii) technical assstance to cartlatlngcredit istitutions to improve their
capability to carry out financial restructuring and subproject
appraisal;
(iii) technicalassistance to GOT to undertake a fisheries development
survey to provide a basis for long-range planning for the development
of the fisheries sector, including preparation of fisheries
development projects suitable for international financing; and
(iv) a olot market nttral thir  amS   to test and develop training
techniques in international marketing, with emphasis on agroindustry
product marketing.
PCIs would include initially the Agricultural Bank of Turkey (TCZB), Balk Bank
(HB) and the Industrial Investment and Credit Bank (SYKB). Other PCIs
satisfactory to the Government and the Bank may be added at a later date. The
subborrowers would be given an option to borrow either in local currency under
the Foreign Exchange Risk Insurance Scheme (FERIS) or in foreign currency.
For subloans in local currency, the Government would onlend Bank funds to the
PCIs on FERIS terms which include a 3 percent spread for the PCIs and a
variable interest rate based on three-month Treasury Bill rates. The PCIs
would onlend such funds to the subborrowers on the FERIS terms plus a 2S
commission. For subloans in foreign currency, Government would relend funds
to the PCIs at the Bank interest rate and the PCI. would onlend to
subborrowers at this rate plus a spread of up to 4% p.a. Government would
also onlend $0.5 million equivalent for technical assistance to the PCIs at
the Bank interest rate. The loan also includes $6.7 million for a fisheries
survey and marketing training program. If grant financing is obtained for
these components, these funds would be reallocated for additional agroindustry
subloans. The fisheries survey would be implemented by the Miniptry of
Agriculture. Establishment of a private foundation for export t:-aining is
under active consideration and this proposed foundation could be a suitable
implementing agency for the pilot marketing training component. Arrangements,
satisfactory to the Bank, for carrying out the marketing training component
would be made by December 31, 1989. The total cost of subproject investments
and the technical assistance components is estimated at about $409 million
equivalent with a foreign exchange component of about 37%. A breakdown of
costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. The loan is expacted to



-3-
be committed in three years and disbursed in six years. Amounts and methods
of procurement and disbursements and the disbursement schedule are shown in
Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of
Bank Group operations in Turkey are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
The Staff Appraisal Report (No. 7653-TU) dated May 10, 1989, is being
distributed separately.
5.       Agreed Actions.  At negotiations agreement was reached with the
Government of Turkey and the PCIs on the following: (a) Subborrowers would be
given the option of borrowing in local currency (at a variable interest rate
tied to the three-month Treasury Bill rate) under the Foreign Exchange Risk
Insurance Scheme (FERIS) or in foreign exchange; (b) each PCI would have to
submit annual audit reports including certification that it is in compliance
with the following financial covenants: (i) a minimum collection ratio of 75%
on medium and long-term loans (except for TCZB which would t-ve a minimum
ratio of 702 for loans made prior to January 1, 1989 and 85% for loans made
thereafter); (ii) a minimum debt-service-cover ratio of 1.1 to 1 for SYKB and
1.2 to 1 for other PCIs; (iii) a cap4*sl adequacy ratio as required by the
Banking Law for commercial banks or a 10 to 1 maximum debt-equity ratio for
development banks, and (iv) provisions for bad and doubtful debts as required
under the Provisions Decree of May 1988; (c) Subproject and enterprise
eligibility criteria would include (i) a minimum economic rate of return of
15% in real terms; (ii) a debt-service coverage ratio averaging at least 1.5
during the five year period following the start of commercial operations and
no less than 1.2 during any year; (iii) a minimum owners/stockholders equity
investment of 351 of assets at the time of application for the subloan, and
owners/stockholders provision of at least 501 of the cost of the proposed
investment; (iv) maximum Bank financing of $5 million for any subproject and
$10 million for any enterprise and (v) compliance with environmental standards
acceptable to the Bank; and (d) Government would provide (i) additional equity
resources to TCZB to reach a ratio of net worth to total assets of at least 62
by the end of 1991 and (ii) payment to TCZB by December 31, 1989 for arrears
on Government guaranteed loans to sales cooperatives.
6.       Initial allocations for subloans would be $71.4 million to TCZB,
$42.8 million to SYXB and $28.6 million to Ralk Bank. The Government would
retain the right to reallocate funds among PCIs (i) if reviews of commitments
and pipeline of loans indicate that a PCI may be unable to utilize its
remaining allocation; (ii) if additional PCIs should become eligible to
participate in the project; or (iii) if a PCI should be unable to carry out
its obligations under the Project Agreement or the Subsidiary Loan Agreement.
The Bank would be prepared to consider adding additional PCIs to the Project
subject to their meeting the financial requirements in paragraph 5 (b) above
and their having adequate agroindustry appraisal capacity. Signing of
Subsidiary Loan Agreements, acceptable to the Bank, between the Governsmet and
at least two PCIs would be a condition of effectiveness. Discontinuation of
the former fixed-rate FERIS would also be a condition of effectiveness. No
disbursement would be made with respect to a particular PCI until a Subsidiary
Loan Agreement acceptable to the Bank had been signed with the PCI.
Conclusion of a Subsidiary Loan Agreement could take place only for a PCI
which had made adequate provisions for non-performing loans in accordance with
Turkey's banking law. PCIs would submit to the Bank for approval full
appraisal reports for subloans above a free limit specified for each PCI, and



-4-
a summary description of the project and certification of eligibility for
subloans below the free limit.
7.       Benefits.  Agroindustry is the largest single subsector in Turkey's
manufacturing sector and plays a major role in the Turkish. economy by
generating employment, providing a market for agricultural output, fostering
entrepreneurship, reducing regional and income disparities and producing for
exports. The proposed project would help revitalize the subsector, thereby
creating additional employment, income and foreign exchange earnings. The
project, by providing funds to several PCIs on equal terms, would also
facilitate increased competition among PCIs for providing improved services to
agroindustries. The Bank ioan would not only provide long term resources to
the participating credit institutions for on-lending to agroindustrial
enterprises but also technical assistance to improve their capabilities to
ap;- aise agroindustry projects and carry out financial restructuring of
distressed enterprises. The technical assistance component would also provide
valuable training programs for those responsible for product development and
marketing in agroindustrial enterprises, and help provide the information
required to support agroindustry development in fisheries. It is anticipated
that the project would finance about 250 agroindustry subprojects resulting in
about US$400 million of incremental investments. On the basis of comparable
investments in earlier years, it is estimated that the project could create
about 20,000 new full-time jobs. The subprojects financed are expected to be
fairly labor intensive, with a cost per job usually not exceeding US$25,000.
While many of the smaller agroindustry units financed are not expected to be
direct exporters themselves, their products would be han"led by established
exporters and export trading companies. All of the agroindustry units would
be processing local raw materials with direct linkages with the agricultural
sector. Many of the workera employed by these units would be less skilled or
new entrants into the labor force.
8.       Rationalefor Bank nvolvement.  The proposed project would support
the Bank's strategy for (i) assisting the development of the agricultural
sector and increasing its commercial orientation; (ii) supporting Turkey's
efforts to increase exports; and (iii) strengthening financial intermediaries
and increasing their areas of competition. Government and the Bank are in
agreement on subsectoral development objectives and on the strategy to achieve
them, i.e., liberalization and concomitant enterprise restructuring.  The
Bank's unique contribution to this process would be as a catalytic agent in
bringing together within the project the parties with a clear stake in the
future of the subsector (the agroindustry enterprises and the participating
banks), defining their roles in subsectoral development and promoting
implementation of key elements of the subsector strategy, i.e. financial
restructuring and development of the marketing function. The Bank's support
of the project is critical for the active and growing involvement of the
PCIs. The proposed project would increase Turkey's foreign exchange earnings
and output, without requiring significant Government budgetary outlays.
9.       Risks.  Continuation of high inflation and economic disequilibrium
could jeopardize the performance of the agroindustry subsector. The
Government has committed itself to a package of reforms, which are expected to
reduce inflation and the fiscal deficit. The Government and the Bank are
closely monitoring implementation of the reform program. Other risks include



the possible slow pace of enterprise restructuring by the PCIs and the
inability of enterprises to appreciate and adopt focussed marketing
strategies. Training and consultant input are provided to reduce these
risks. There may be initial resistance from potential borrowers to the switch
from fixed to variable interest rates under the FERIS scheme, but the
advantages of the new arrangements should become evident if the Government's
anti-inflation policy induces downward movement in these rates.
10.      Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recouxend that the Executive
Directors approve the proposed loan.
