1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

In the mid 1990s, the Government of Tanzania (GOT) initiated an ambitious program of
public sector reform focusing on, inter alia, civil service reform, public expenditure
reform, and private sector development. Apart from expenditure control, reform of tax
administration was perhaps the single most important macro policy issue facing the
Government. Tax administration was thus a key element in the Government's strategy for
increasing tax revenue as well as decreasing economic distortions and promoting the
transparency of tax and customs collections.

The International Development Association (IDA)-funded Tax Administration Project
(TAP), which was approved in March 1999, was part of a broader multi-development
partner program to support the Government's efforts in improving tax administration in
Tanzania. The total cost of the program was US$70.2 million to which IDA provided
US$40 million under the TAP. Other development partners who pledged to contribute
US$23.2 million to the program included the Danish International Development Agency
(DANIDA), United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID-UK),
European Union (EU), Finland, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency
(SIDA) and GTZ (Germany). The remainder of US$7 million was to be contributed by
the Government of Tanzania. The IMF Technical Assistance group (IMF-East Afritac)
and Fiscal Affairs Department (IMF-FAD) provided valuable technical assistance
directly to the Tanzania Revenue Authority.

The project development objective (PDO) of the Tax Administration Project (TAP) was
to assist the Government in raising tax revenues without increasing tax rates by: (i)
improving the legal framework; (ii) broadening the tax base; (iii) strengthening the
Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) to increase efficiency and effectiveness of tax
administration; and (iv) improving the administrative infrastructure.

The project was designed to address major shortcomings in tax administration by
expanding the tax base, amending and consolidating the legal framework, modernizing
collection and audit procedures, and strengthening the institutional framework for
enforcement.

The TAP was originally supposed to close on December 31, 2004 but the closing date
was extended twice and it closed on December 31, 2006. Total disbursed funds amounted
to US$37.5 million or 93.7 percent of the Credit. A grace period of 4 months after the
closing date was provided for presentation of withdrawal applications for activities
carried out before the closing date. The last disbursement was made on March 19, 2007.
The undisbursed amount of US$2.5 million will be cancelled.

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Throughout the 1990s, Tanzania was facing serious fiscal problems arising from the gap
between stagnant revenues and swelling public expenditures mainly driven by large
outlays on administration. The fiscal deficit, after grants, was 5 percent of GDP in 1993-
1994 and rose to 7.9 percent of GDP in 1994-1995. The large budgetary shortfall,
together with the quasi-fiscal deficit were responsible for high inflation that averaged to
about 25 percent in the mid 1990s and increasing domestic debt which stood at about 11
percent of GDP in 1998-1999.

The Government received support from the World Bank (an IDF Grant) and several other
development partners to establish the TRA as a quasi-autonomous executive agency in
1996. While the need to increase revenues on a sustainable basis was urgent, there were
doubts about the ability of TRA to retain qualified staff within the Government civil
service structure.

Tanzania's tax revenue collection in the late 1990s averaged about 12.4 percent of GDP
notwithstanding the introduction of a new investment act in 1997 and the introduction of
Value Added Tax (VAT) in 1998. Tax evasion was endemic mainly as a result of: (i)
institutional weaknesses in the TRA including limited technical and managerial skills,
lack of proper equipment, poor infrastructure, antiquated business processes, and weak
tax audit and investigative functions; and (ii) virtually no incentives for voluntary
compliance or sanctions for non-compliance (such as criminal prosecution). The
immediate challenges facing the Government included reforming the complex eleven-
band rate structure of personal income tax, rationalizing and closing loopholes in the area
of corporate income taxes, including exemptions, and simplifying the excise system.

The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of June 20, 1997 recognized that
macroeconomic stability was critical to attaining the GOT's goal of rapid and sustained
growth. It emphasized the need for building much needed capacity in areas critical for
sound economic management, specifically in TRA. To this end, the project was designed
to strengthen tax administration so that the improvement in revenue performance would
contribute to significant increases in domestic resources, on a sustainable basis, to finance
budgetary needs. The project was also to support tax policy reforms aimed at eliminating
provisions that created distortions in economic decision making.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators

The project seeks to assist the Government of Tanzania in raising its tax revenues without
increasing tax rates by: (i) improving the legal framework; (ii) broadening the tax base;
(iii) strengthening the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) to increase the efficiency and
effectiveness of tax administration; and (iv) improving the administrative infrastructure.

The original key performance indicators included:
(i) tax gap;


                                            7

(ii) number of declarations as a ratio of registered taxpayers;
(iii) on time declarations as a ratio of total declarations;
(iv) arrears recovered at the end of the year as a percentage of beginning-of-year arrears
     balance;
(v) registered taxpayers per employee;
(vi) tax collections per employee;
(vii) tax arrears as a percentage of annual revenue collection; and
(viii) tax revenue as a percentage of GDP

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification

There was no revised PDO.

After implementation had gone on for about two years, it was realized that the original
key performance indicators were focusing only on monitoring revenue targets and no
significant attention was being given to monitoring other important areas of TRA's
performance as spelt out in its first five-year Corporate Plan (FY1999-2003). These areas
included, among others, the quality of taxpayer services, compliance and investigation
capacity and integrity of TRA staff, and advice to the Ministry of Finance on tax policy.
It was agreed at the Mid Term Review (MTR) in May 2003 that the key performance
indicators be revised to be aligned with the objectives of the Corporate Plan and they
would be used as the basis to monitor implementation progress by both the TRA
management and the development partners participating in the program


The revision of the performance indicators was a combination of redefining some of the
old performance indicators more precisely, introduction of new indicators, and dropping
some of the old indicators. The resulting set key performance indicators that were
adopted at the beginning of 2004 included:
(i) increase in tax revenue collected;
(ii) number of registered taxpayers;
(iii) total revenue collected as a percentage of revenue target for the year;
(iv) amount of previous year's arrears collected as a percentage of total amount of tax
     arrears at the beginning of the year;
(v) average number of days to identify stop-filers;
(vi) percentage of customs clearances made within 24 hours;
(vii) percentage of VAT refunds made within one month;
(viii) percentage of Income tax refunds made within 45 days; and
(ix) percentage of duty drawbacks made within one month;

1.4 Main Beneficiaries,

The primary target group expected to benefit from the project was the Government of
Tanzania as the main objective was to raise tax revenues for the Government. In
pursuance of this objective, the project was expected to provide quantitative
improvements in tax administration with respect to transparency, effectiveness, and
assistance to taxpayers. Thus TRA and taxpayers would also benefit as TRA institutional


                                              8

capacity would be greatly enhanced and the taxpayers would benefit from a more
efficient and transparent tax administration. The project would also enable measurable
improvements in control and monitoring of compliance. Increased tax revenues would
also benefit the general population as they would translate into reduced fiscal deficits
which affect the macroeconomic fundamentals that in turn affect everybody in the
economy.

1.5 Original Components

The original components included:

(i) Improving the Legal Framework (US$0.8 million). This included updating,
amending, consolidating and where necessary, enacting laws and regulations for taxes
and customs. In addition, it included introducing a regulatory framework for the
Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) and supporting the establishment of an
harmonized appeals machinery.
(ii) Broadening the Tax Base (US$1.8 million). This would support the increase of the
number of registered taxpayers, rationalizing the number of deductions, exemptions and
concessions granted by tax laws, and identifying new sources of revenue and new areas
for expanding the tax base.
(iii) Strengthening the Institution (US$37.7 million). This component would support
the introduction of modern management systems to all TRA departments, improving
training and revisiting the incentive/performance structure for TRA. Specifically, the
focus would be on improving tax collection through: (a) process re-engineering and
computerization of the three revenue departments and TRA support departments; (b)
improving the recovery of tax arrears; (c) improving the control of tax evasion; and (d)
facilitating voluntary compliance.
(iv) Improving the Administrative Infrastructure (US$20.5 million). This included
rehabilitation, refurbishment and equipping of existing tax offices/customs facilities and
construction of new facilities.
(v) Project Coordination and Implementation (US$2.9 million). This included project
management expenses.

1.6 Revised Components

There was no revision to the components

1.7 Other significant changes

Project Implementation Support and Monitoring. The project was initially prepared and
supervised by the Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) and the
Operational Quality and Knowledge Services (AFTQK) Units until late in 2001 when the
Task Team Leader left the Africa Region. Supervision of the project was transferred to
AFTFS (Financial Sector Unit) in April 2002. The last implementation suppport mission
had been in May 2001 and the new team leadership found very little information on
implementation progress and noted that the identified performance indicators were




                                            9

inadequate. The indicators were revised after the Mid-Term Review in May 2003 (see
Section 1.3 above).


Funding Allocations. The Credit amounts that had been previously allocated among
disbursement categories were significantly changed during the course of implementation
to reflect the realities during implementation. An initial Unallocated amount of SDR3.5
million was allocated to the other components of the project over the life of the project.

The allocation for training and workshops was increased by 41.2 percent reflecting the
critical need for capacity building for TRA staff. Other categories where additional
funding was provided through reallocation of funds were civil works and purchase of
goods.

Disbursements. The project started off with disbursements under the Loan
Administration Change Initiative (LACI) which proved problematic as it was still a new
initiative. When the LACI was finally scrapped in the World Bank, the project reverted to
the traditional withdrawal application method.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry




                                            10

Although the TRA was established in 1996 and there were improvements in revenue
collection over the next two years, tax revenue remained low at about 12 percent of GDP
by 1998. In requesting for assistance under TAP, the Government was therefore looking
for avenues of enhancing tax collections without having to raise taxes. The most obvious
was improving the efficiency and effectiveness of TRA.

The Government realized that the establishment of TRA had been a radical and higher
risk strategy since there were concerns on whether TRA could attract and retain qualified
staff who could manage the change process. During the design of the TAP, the
Government made a strategic choice to continue with tax reforms through incremental
measures as opposed to a more fundamental and fast-paced strategy. It also considered
whether the reforms should be all-inclusive and cover tax administration of the local
government. However, it was felt that this would not only delay much needed reform, but
it could also undermine the project's effectiveness because it was very ambitious. Local
government reform was still in its infancy at that time and discussions on inter-
governmental fiscal relationships had not taken place. It was decided that a strong tax
central agency needed to be formed first which could then support future efforts of local
governments. Consideration was also given to the privatization of customs but it was
thought to be too radical a change at this point. It was felt that any more radical changes
to TRA could increase resistance to change, especially from the private sector, which
would be to the detriment of the entire tax reform effort.

Project preparation and design considered lessons learned from previous tax
administration projects in other countries. They included: (i) the need for political
commitment to the reform and active support for its implementation; (ii) appropriate
emphasis on organization, business processes, human resource selection, pay and training
issues and avoidance of an overemphasis on technology; (iii) competent leadership in
implementation and close supervision by the Government; (iv) focus on voluntary
compliance through improvements in the legal framework, administration and the quality
of services, and fair grievance redressing; and (v) mechanisms to enhance the
transparency and accountability of tax administration such as taxpayer registration
number, prioritization assessment, investigation and collection activities, and an effective
public relations campaign to educate taxpayers regarding their legal obligations.

Lessons learned from other operations in Tanzania were also considered. These included:
(i) the need for close implementation support of the project which would be enhanced by
the transfer of project preparation and implementation support to the Country Office; (ii)
the need to ensure adequate counterpart funding which would be facilitated by instituting
advance payment of a portion of the Government's contribution in the project account
and institution of an appropriate revenue retention scheme; and (iii) close donor
cooperation which would result in donors working towards a program approach and
focusing on a conceptual framework within which interested donors could contribute.

2.2 Implementation
There were implementation delays at the beginning of the project as a result of limited
implementation capacity within the TRA. The project started off with the TRA staff in
charge of project coordination. After it was realized that the TRA staff did not have


                                           11

adequate capacity in project implementation, a Project Coordinator with international
experience in the field of tax administration and a procurement adviser were appointed to
supplement the TRA staff in implementation. However, the pace of implementation
remained slow and there was a significant lack of donor coordination. When the contracts
of the two consultants ended, TRA management decided to enhance its staff capacity and
mainstream project implementation into its institutional structures. A modernization
manager was appointed and assigned staff to carry out procurement and financial
management activities for the project. This proved to be a decisive factor in turning
around the performance of the project. Reporting on project progress was greatly
improved and financial reports generated by TRA were accepted by the development
partners to evaluate performance of the program rather than asking for a separate set of
reports.

On the Bank side, the Task Team Leader (TTL) left the Africa Region towards the end of
2001 and a decision was made to transfer implementation support of the project (in April
2002) from AFTQK to AFTFS where the new TTL was located. This change was
followed with a significant turnaround in donor coordination and consistent follow-up on
project activities. Quarterly meetings among the development partners and TRA were
initiated and there was always an agreed set of activities at the end of each
implementation support mission that TRA had to carry out. The TAP was never in
project-at-risk status during its lifetime.

The Mid-Term Review (MTR) took place in May 2003 at which point a new Corporate
Plan for TRA (FY2004-2008) was presented and reviewed. At the MTR, a proposal was
made to move to basket funding by developing partners as a framework for future support
to the Corporate Plan. It was agreed that the basket funding starts with DANIDA funds
and other development partners would join as and when they were ready. The basket
funding became operational in 2005 with contributions from Denmark, the European
Union, and UK-DFID. The World Bank continued with the implementation of the TAP
and only started contributing to the basket fund arrangements in December 2006 from the
newly effective Tax Modernization Project (TMP).

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
The M&E framework developed during project preparation was only focused on
monitoring TRA's revenue collections and did not cater for monitoring other TRA
activities that the project was intended to strengthen, such as quality of taxpayer service
and the effectiveness of compliance and investigations. The M&E framework was revised
after the MTR to take into account all the activities identified in the TRA's Corporate
Plan. This led to significant improvement in reporting and the progress reports submitted
to TRA Management and the Board of Directors were the same reports forwarded to the
Development Partners. The new set of key performance indicators identified after the
MTR was used to monitor implementation progress until the end of the project.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

The project was initially given an Environmental Assessment Category C, so no
safeguard issues were identified during preparation.


                                            12

There were no fiduciary compliance issues. The project's financial management and
accounting systems were satisfactory and could be relied upon to produce understandable,
timely, and reliable financial reports. TRA moved to International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) in July 2005, which included moving to fully accrual accounting.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase

TAP supported the implementation of the last three years of TRA's first five-year
corporate plan (from FY1999 to FY2003) which focused on achievement of sustainable
tax revenue collection. It also provided support to implementation of the second five-year
corporate plan (from FY2004 to FY2008). In order to ensure continuity in implementing
the second corporate plan after TAP closed, and implementation of the third corporate
plan, the Government prepared a revised investment plan in FY2004 with a total cost of
US$33.6 million which was discussed with development partners. A basket funding
arrangement with several development partners was initiated to provide resources for the
investment plan. DFID and DANIDA contributed US$19.6 million for this basket
funding. IDA approved a US$12 million Tax Modernization Project in June 2006 as part
of the basket funding arrangement. The GOT will provide US$2 million to the TMP. The
revised investment plan includes US$3.2 million to support the Zanzibar Revenue Board
(ZRB) in implementing its corporate plan.

The TMP builds on the results of the TAP and is a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp) to the
second phase of tax administration reforms with the focus shifted to supporting modern
compliance management approaches based on an appropriate mix of high quality
taxpayer services and efficient, well targeted enforcement measures. While the TAP
focused on performance of individual tax administration functions and units, the TMP
follows a holistic, integrated approach that supports the five core strategies of the TRA
Corporate Plan, namely:

(i) improvement of revenue collection in a cost effective way;
(ii) full integration of TRA operations, including further integration of business processes,
     further development and roll-out of the IT system, and strengthening of the Large
     Taxpayer Department;
(iii) provision f high quality and responsive customer service;
(iv) promotion of tax compliance through a fair, equitable and transparent application of
     tax laws; and
(v) improvement of staff competencies, motivation, integrity and accountability.


3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation

The objective of increasing tax revenues in order to generate enough resources to support
Government programs was a high priority for Tanzania at the time of project design and
was as relevant then as it is today. By the end of the project, total revenue collection had
increased almost threefold in absolute terms from TShs 701 billion in FY2000 to TShs



                                            13

2,040 billion in FY2006 as compared to an end-of-project target of TShs 1,997 billion. In
US dollar terms, revenue collection grew from US$881 million in FY2000 to US$1,780
million in FY2006, representing an increase of 102 percent in real terms. The project's
objective is also in line with the current World Bank assistance strategy (the Joint
Assistance Strategy of March 1, 2007) which supports the Government's second poverty
reduction strategy, the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty; 2005-
2010. The strategy requires increasing resources to implement the activities in the
identified three clusters of broad outcomes: (i) growth of the economy and reduction of
income poverty; (ii) improvement of quality of life and social well being; and (iii)
governance and accountability.

Implementation of TAP was mainstreamed into the activities of TRA in line with the
Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness which discourages the use of stand alone Project
Implementation Units. Mainstreaming of implementation has ensured that there is
continuity in the activities previously supported by TAP and in the implementation of the
follow-on project, the Tax Modernization Project (TMP). While the TRA did not have
adequate implementation capacity at the beginning of the project, the capacity has been
strengthened during the course of the project and the relevant staff is now familiar with
World Bank procurement and financial management procedures. This is critical in the
efficient implementation of the TMP.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

The project achieved its development objective of assisting GOT to raise tax
revenues without increasing tax rates. Total revenue collection has increased almost
threefold in absolute terms from TShs 701 billion in FY2000 to TShs 2,040 billion in
FY2006, exceeding the projected target of TShs 1,997 billion. Even when measured by
the internationally preferred method of the ratio of tax revenue to GDP, tax revenue has
consistently risen from 12.4 percent of GDP in FY1999 to 12.9 percent in FY2002 and
13.8 percent in FY2006.

TRA has consistently exceeded its collection targets since the project started. This has
been a result of the strengthening of TRA's efficiency and effectiveness. The Large
Taxpayers Department (LTD) has been strengthened and the Income Tax and VAT
departments integrated into the Domestic Revenue Department (DRD). The LTD and
Information Systems (IS) Departments implemented a sound strategy for capacity
building and proactively addressing operational challenges. The LTD has received
certification from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The average
number of days to identify stop-filers for the DRD has reduced from 28 days in July 2003
for direct taxes to 4 days in December 2006.

A Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) system was established and the TRA has
aggressively registered new taxpayers. The number of TIN-registered taxpayers has
increased from 190,000 in July 2003 to 309,000 in December 2006 while the number of
registered large taxpayers has increased from 100 to 370 over the same period. Of the
latter, fifty of them account for 80 percent of total revenue. Significant achievements
have been made in the improvement of TRA administrative infrastructure. The project


                                           14

supported the construction of 31 offices and rehabilitation of 8 buildings throughout the
country together with the purchase of transport equipment (vehicles, motorcycles,
motorboats) to assist in monitoring compliance, and office equipment and computers.

A major legislation, The Income Tax Act, 1973, was amended and adopted in June 2004,
together with its practice notes and regulations. The draft Miscellaneous Taxes
Amendment Act and the East African Customs Management Act are in draft form
awaiting presentation to the relevant legislative bodies. While all the legal amendments
envisaged under the project have not been carried out, the Income Tax Act was the most
critical and its amendment has significantly contributed to the improvement registered in
tax administration.

The key performance indicators that had been identified during project preparation were
found to be inadequate as they focused only on monitoring revenue targets and no
significant attention was being given to monitoring other important areas of TRA's
performance. The performance of the revised indicators that were introduced after the
Mid Term Review has been strong. The table below summarizes the performance of the
one PDO indicator and the eight intermediate outcome indicators. In all cases where end
of project data for the indicators is available, 11 of the 14 targets have been exceeded.

3.3 Efficiency

No Net present Value or Economic rate of Return was calculated for the project.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating

Rating: Satisfactory

A satisfactory rating for the overall outcome rating is justified because the project
development objective was achieved. Tax revenue has increased both in absolute
numbers and as a percentage of GDP. This has been largely a result of the enhancement
of the efficiency and effectiveness of TRA in tax administration through organizational
restructuring, capacity building, investment in information systems, provision of the
necessary tools to staff, such as transportation for surveillance, and an improved working
environment through construction of new offices and rehabilitation of existing offices.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts

(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development

As noted before, increased tax revenues benefit the general population as they translate
into reduced fiscal deficits which affect the macroeconomic fundamentals that in turn
affect everybody in the economy.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The capacity of the TRA has been substantially improved through changes in the
organizational structure and training. The project also provided tools (vehicles, patrol
boats, computers, office equipment) to enhance staff productivity, and an improved work
environment through building of new offices and rehabilitating existing ones. A lot of
efficiency has been achieved through the acquisition of technological tools such as the
VAT Information Processing System (VIPS), Integrated Tax Administration System
(ITAX) 2000, and Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) 2.7.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

TAP which started as a normal World Bank project with parallel financing from other
development partners has evolved into the TMP, a SWAp which is a model in donor
coordination and harmonization. This was the first such arrangement in the portfolio of
the AFTFS which the Unit is now replicating in several other countries in the Region.

3.6 Summary of Findings of Beneficiary Survey and/or Stakeholder Workshops

No survey or Workshop was undertaken

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome




                                           16

Rating: Negligible to Low

The risk to the development outcome of the project is assessed as negligible to low. All
the reforms at TRA have been incorporated into its institutional structure and it is highly
unlikely that they would be reversed after the project has closed. The preparation of a
five-year Corporate Plan has now become part of the culture of TRA management and
the reports prepared for development partners in monitoring the performance of the Plan
are the same reports used by the TRA management for internal decision making. In
general, the implementation of the TAP and its outcomes outlined in Section 3.2 above
have led to a major positive change in the mindset of the management and staff of the
TRA with regard to their institutional mission.

In order to ensure sustainability, the Government has committed to set aside TShs 2
billion every year, since FY2005, aimed at replacing worn out TRA assets in the coming
years. In addition, the legal framework for tax administration has been strengthened with
the amendment of the Income Tax Act, 1973 and replacing it with the Income Tax Act,
2004 together with its supporting Practice Notes and Regulations. To crown it all, the
Government has embarked on the TMP which builds on the achievements of the TAP and
shifts the focus of tax reforms to supporting modern compliance management approaches
based on an appropriate mix of high quality taxpayer services and efficient, well targeted
enforcement measures.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance

(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry

Rating: Satisfactory

Bank performance in ensuring quality at entry has been rated as satisfactory. It was
proposed that project accounts be integrated into the TRA accounting system with direct
reporting to the Commissioner of Finance. The Bank carried out a detailed review of the
proposed financial management arrangements during appraisal and the adequacy of
TRA's accounting system in maintaining overall project records, manage disbursements,
produce management reports and ensure timely audit of financial statements. The Bank
also identified and rated a number of critical risks that could affect the successful
achievement of the development objective. Risk minimization measures were discussed
and agreed with the Government. Lessons learned from other tax administration projects
and implementing Bank projects in Tanzania were considered and reflected in the project
design.

One area where quality at entry was not robust was the initial Monitoring and Evaluation
(M&E) framework. The performance indicators identified during appraisal were only
focusing on TRA's revenue targets and did not provide for monitoring other important
aspects of TRA's activities.




                                           17

(b) Quality of Supervision

Rating: Satisfactory

The quality of supervision has been rated satisfactory on the basis of the tremendous
turnaround in the intensity and quality of supervision in the last five years of the project
which included the assembly of a technically sound supervision team that included an
experienced tax specialist. The Financial Management Specialist who is based in the
Country Office was designated as a deputy Task Team Leader (TTL) in order to ensure
that queries from the Borrower were addressed expeditiously. Over the seven years of the
project's life, TAP had one TTL during the first two and a half years (November 1999 to
March 2002) and two TTLs for the remainder of the project. By Bank standards, this was
a low rate of turnover in team leadership which ensured continuity. The only lapse was
during the transition of Task Team Leadership from AFTQK to AFTFS where there was
no implementation support mission between May 2001 and April 2002.

The new Team Leadership quickly requested the Government to field a supervision
mission to update information on the project and identified the weaknesses in the results
framework. The Government sanctioned the first implementation support mission in
October 2002. Before this mission, the team proposed a set of activities that would ensure
that the fiduciary aspects of the project were being attended to and held two video
conferences with TRA and development partners to review project activities and jump-
start donor coordination.

The proactive measures instituted by the team ensured that there were two
implementation support missions every year and the performance of donor coordination
changed from "worst practice" to "very good practice". A set of agreed activities would
be documented at each implementation suppport mission and the status of each reviewed
at the subsequent mission. Donor coordination meetings started being held on a quarterly
basis.

The tremendous efforts by the new team to turn around the project were enough to make
up for the shortcomings in implementation suppport in the first two years of project
implementation. The initial focus was mainly on ensuring TRA's revenue collection
targets and giving little attention to other tax reform activities, especially on the
institutional strengthening of TRA and the policy front, which led to conflicting signals in
the assessment of implementation progress. For example, while there were significant
delays in implementing some crucial activities such as business process re-engineering
(BPR) and computerization of Income Tax administration, the project was being rated
satisfactory on account of increased revenue collections alone.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The change of implementation responsibility by the Bank at an early stage was very
crucial to the success of the TAP. The new team introduced a robust M&E framework
and redirected the focus of the TRA management to the big picture policy activities in the


                                             18

project rather than focusing on just revenue collections. The team introduced proactive
measures to ensure that there was ongoing adequate follow-up on project activities.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

Government performance has been rated as Satisfactory. The Government was
committed to the reforms under TAP throughout the project and is currently
implementing a follow-on project, the TMP, to build upon the achievements of TAP.

Among the shortcomings of Government performance, it is worth noting the delay in
enacting some of the bills that were prepared under the project. While the presentation of
bills to Parliament is beyond the mandate of the TRA, the Government was in a position
to influence the legislative agenda in Parliament to have these bills enacted. The most
important bill, the Income Tax Act, 2004 was enacted but several other bills remained in
draft form.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The TRA management has been committed to preparing and implementing Corporate
Plans starting in FY1999 and mainstreaming project implementation into the structures of
the TRA. A Modernization Department has been set and one of its responsibilities is
oversight over project implementation. The quality of financial and implementation
progress reports has been high such that they were utilized by both TRA management and
development partners to monitor progress. The TRA management was flexible in
adjusting the implementation arrangements until a working model was achieved.

However, there were some long procurement delays, especially in the improving the
administrative infrastructure component, pointing to less than adequate procurement
planning. There were also a delay in project effectiveness and initial implementation
problems mainly related to a delay in appointing a competent Project Coordinator.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance

Rating: Satisfactory

The Borrower remained committed to the development objective throughout the life of
the project and was looking beyond TAP even before it closed. In order to deepen the
development outcome of TAP, the Borrower was proactive in preparing TRA's second
Corporate Plan in 2004 which is now being funded as a Sector Wide Approach (SWAp)
through a multi-donor basket-funded Tax Modernization Program. The TRA was able to
adjust implementation arrangements until a model that worked well was attained. This
has ensured sustainability and continuity during the follow-on TMP.

6. Lessons Learned


                                            19

       Where necessary, adjustments in implementation arrangements can be very
       valuable, especially if carried out earlier on during the life of the project.
       IDA has to be credited for recognizing implementation problems at an early stage
       and taking the necessary steps early on in the project to provide a better technical
       fit of skills. This resulted in the key performance indicators being revised to
       correspond to the outcomes that hand been identified by TRA in its first
       Corporate Plan and to shift the focus from increase in tax revenues only and
       include improvement in the quality of taxpayer services as well.

       Enhancing counterpart and country ownership creates incentives for
       commitment to implementation. During project implementation, IDA
       empowered the GOT by supporting the implementation of TRA's own five-year
       corporate plan to be monitored with agreed performance indicators. There was
       recognition by IDA and other development partner co-financiers that TRA was a
       capable partner who could be entrusted to deliver from a plan that also met the
       project development objectives. In addition, rather than requiring special reports,
       development partners accepted to use TRA's semi-annual reports for its Board of
       Directors and monthly reports for its management for use in monitoring project
       achievements.

       Harmonized donor approach is a more efficient and effective way of
       providing assistance to the Government. TAP was a model in donor
       coordination and harmonization. In addition to IDA, five other Development
       Partners provided parallel financing to TRA and joint implementation Support
       missions were undertaken twice a year. This harmonized approached added great
       value to project implementation and results by providing economies of scale,
       reduced inefficiencies, and avoided duplication of efforts by diverse entities
       pursuing the same goal. Due to the success of the harmonized approach under
       TAP, a follow-up project was designed as basket funding to take full advantage of
       synergies created when all donor funds including IDA are put together for a
       common goal.


7. Comments on Issues Raised by Borrower/Implementing Agencies/Partners

(a) Borrower/implementing agencies

The Borrower has prepared and submitted its own Implementation Completion and
Results Report (ICR) and it is attached as Annex 7. The Borrower was very pleased in
general with project implementation and the results that were achieved. However, in their
comments, the Borrower wished that World Bank procurement processes could be
shortened and streamlined by allowing a higher threshold for post procurement review.
The team is of the view that this would depend on the perceived country risk as
determined in the Country Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) and the
procurement capacity in the respective implementing agencies.




                                            20

The Borrower's recommendation that the World Bank provide regular training of project
beneficiaries on procurement matters is valid. It was observed during implementation
suppport missions that several contracts under the project involved large amounts but
there wasn't adequate procurement planning. TRA had only one procurement expert
when the organization needed at least two more experts to execute all the contracts in the
procurement plan on time. The Borrower does not acknowledge that some of the
procurement delays were a result of the weak procurement capacity in the implementing
agency.

The assessment of Highly Satisfactory for project outcomes by the Borrower is most
probably due to the fact that it is focusing only on revenue collections and not taking into
account the outcomes in the various project components. The Borrower is also taking into
account activities being funded under the multi-donor basket funding for the Tax
Modernization Program which became operational in 2005. IDA funding for the Tax
Modernization Program started in December 2006 when the World Bank's Tax
Modernization Project (TMP) became effective. Before that, the Tax Modernization
Program was being funded by other development partners alongside the TAP.

Annex 2. Outputs by Component

Component 1: Improving the Legal Framework

The overall results achieved under this component are rated moderately satisfactory.

Out of about 20 laws that were proposed to be updated, revised, harmonized, and/or
consolidated, only the Income Tax, 1973 was amended. The amendments to the East
African Community Customs Management Act 2005 proposed by the customs authorities
of Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda have not yet been discussed by the East Africa
Legislative Assembly as the body had not been re-constituted by December 2006 due to a
dispute regarding the election process of the Kenyan members of the Assembly.

Income Tax Act. The Income Tax, 1973 was amended in 2004 and the TRA has, after
considerable delay, published and distributed the remaining practice notes and standards
for tax consultants and self-assessment audit guides for income tax. In total, 11 practice
notes were issued and further notes dealing with transfer pricing issues and lease
financing have been prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Finance for review. Also,
guidelines on the treatment of charitable organizations have been made available.

East African Customs Management Act. The East African Legislative Assembly has
now been reconstituted but with the recent accession of Rwanda and Burundi to the East
African Community, the customs authorities of these two countries will most likely
present additional proposals for amendments. The regulations for the effective
administration of the existing Act have been approved by the East African Community
Council of Ministers but with a substantial delay. They came into force on 1st January
2007.

Harmonization of Tax Laws. The draft Miscellaneous Taxes Amendment Act has been
prepared and has been with the Ministry of Finance for more than a year. It is yet to be
presented to Parliament.

Common Tax Procedure Code. Development of a common tax administration code that
would consolidate in one statute all tax administration provisions that were scattered in
different tax laws has not taken place. The TRA has been in discussions with GTZ on the
possibility of technical assistance to draft a common tax procedure code.


Component 2: Broadening the Tax Base

The overall result under this component is rated satisfactory.

Block Management System. TRA continues to implement the block management system
(BMS), and the initial assessment of the impact of the system shows that the system is
successful in identifying non-registered taxpayers. The system however is not operating
at its optimum level. If operated well, the BMS should also improve the provision of
information on tax issues to the small business community, as one of its objectives is to
offer taxpayer education and services during the visits, followed up by taxpayer


                                            23

education seminars for specific blocks and tailored to block taxpayers' needs. A major
constraint has been allocating a sufficient number of skilled staff to the block
management exercise which has reduced the scope and quality of services provided. This
could have a negative impact on the long-term compliance behavior of the businesses
brought into the tax net.

In the process of implementing the BMS, a total of 51,812 taxpayers were visited
between January and September 2006. The door-to-door visits identified 12,130 non-
registered taxpayers; this means that 39% of the newly registered taxpayers in the period
January to September 2006 (31,107 new registrations) were a result of the BMS. The
major challenges for the future application of the BMS will be to ensure a constant
follow-up process, both in the areas of monitoring taxpayer compliance and providing
specific services.

TIN Allocation. Due to the exercise to clean up the TIN database and correct detected
problems of mixing motor vehicle registration and TIN as well as eliminating multiple
TIN allocations, the number of TIN-registered taxpayers had decreased from 318,033 in
June 2005 to 288,680 in June 2006. By December 2006, the number had increased again
to 309,245.

Component 3: Institutional Strengthening of TRA

The overall result under this component is rated satisfactory.

Customs Department. The roll-out of ASYCUDA++ to various customs stations in the
country is continuing. Tanga port, Holili, Kilimanjaro International Airport, Tarakea and
Namanga and Horohoro are now connected. However, there is an urgent need to increase
the ASYCUDA staff team to 15 staff to serve the increasing number of stations. The
implementation of the cargo tracking system has not taken place as the consultancy was
only awarded at the end of towards the end of 2006. The implementation of the compliant
trader scheme and development of operational manuals also did not take place under TAP
as planned.

The CED has developed an audit manual for post-clearance audits and has published a
notice for all traders to keep specified books of account for international trade
transactions. In order to improve clearance speed and service to the taxpayer, an
electronic interface for the seamless exchange of information between ASYCUDA++ and
TISCAN has been tested and was rolled out in early 2007. Among the other outstanding
activities is the training of CED staff in risk management and establishing one-stop
border points with neighboring countries.

Large Taxpayer Department. The LTD has consolidated its role as the core revenue
collection department of TRA. The plan to increase the taxpayer population (major
taxpayers) administered by the LTD has been implemented and the total number grew
from 100 in 2003 to 370 by December 2006, exceeding the target of 300 set for the end
of the project.




                                          24

The LTD in FY2005/06 collected a total of TShs 764.4 billion, which represents 38
percent of total TRA and 67 percent of domestic revenue collection. The collection target
for the last year of the project has been surpassed by 5 percent. The LTD continued to
build technical expertise in the audit of the main large taxpayer business segments, with a
priority in the mining sector where technical assistance was provided by a mining
taxation expert. Recent audits of mining companies have revealed substantial under-
declarations of CIT and largely excessive VAT refund claims. This illustrates the
compliance risks in the mining sector and highlights the importance of further building of
special mining companies audit capacity.

LTD has received ISO certification. The final examination by ISO auditors was carried
out in November 2006 and LTD is now awaiting the official issuance of the certificate.
Following the successful pilot of ISO certification in the LTD, TRA is now planning to
expand the ISO certification process to the entire organization.


Component 4: Improving the Administrative Structure

The overall result under this component is rated satisfactory.

The TAP supported the construction of 31 offices and rehabilitation of 8 buildings around
the country which has greatly improved the working environment for TRA staff. The
project also supported the purchase of computers, generators, and office furniture and
equipment to increase the productivity of staff. In addition, 44 motor vehicles, 157 motor
cycles and 5 patrol boats were purchased to enhance service delivery and the surveillance
capacity of the TRA, especially against smuggling on both Lake Victoria and the Indian
Ocean.

          IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION AND RESULTS REPORT



1.0    INTRODUCTION
The IDA funded Tax Administration Project (TAP) was signed between the Government and
IDA in August 1999. Thereafter, TAP-IDA became operational in March 2000 for a total amount
of US$40m being part of a broader multi-development partner financing of US$70.2m for TAP.
TAP provided an umbrella for all Development Partner assistance from external sources to the
Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) and was in line with the implementation of the first TRA
Corporate Plan which covered the period 1998/99  2002/03.

The overall Project Development Objective (PDO) of TAP was to assist the Government of
Tanzania in raising its tax revenues without increasing tax rates by (i) improving the legal
framework, (ii) broadening the tax base, (iii) strengthening the Tanzania Revenue Authority
(TRA) to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of Tax Administration, and (iv) improving the
administrative infrastructure.

2.0    IMPLEMENTATION OF TAP PDOs

TRA has made significant progress in revenue collection since the start of the project in 1999.
Revenue collections have increased from Shs 701 billion in 1999/00 to Shs 1,144 billion in
2002/03 at the completion of the first Corporate Plan. Revenue collections have continued to
increase and TRA collected revenue amounting to Shs 2,041 billion during 2005/06 as shown in
Appendix 1.

The Performance Indicators in the first Corporate Plan and TAP were based on the Revenue
Departments as shown in Appendix 2 focusing on:
             Registered Taxpayers per employee
             Tax collections per employee
             Ratio of on time declarations to total declarations
             Ratio of declarations to registered taxpayers
             Collections through Banks
             Ratio of arrears to annual collections
             Ratio of arrears recovered to beginning of year arrears
             TIN and VAT registrations
             Revenue to GDP ratio

2.1    Improving the legal framework

TRA has enhanced the legal framework through review and adoption of the Income Tax Act
2004 and its supporting Practice Notes and Regulations. Additionally, a review to update and
harmonise all tax laws and regulations has been conducted in order to have a single reference



                                             30

document for all domestic tax laws. TRA has made various recommendations during the review
of the East African Community Customs Management Act that was adopted in January 2005 by
the member states. The Legal Service Department has been strengthened with        recruitment   of
advocates.

2.2     Broadening the tax base

Under TAP, the Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) system was established in 2000/01 and is
operational in ten offices of Arusha, Mwanza, Kilimanjaro, Shinyanga, Dodoma, Morogoro,
Mbeya, Tanga, Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam which are now connected to the Central Server. The
number of TIN registered taxpayers has increased from a total of 92,913 taxpayers in 2000/01 to
309,245 taxpayers as at December 2006.

Other measures to broaden the tax base include introduction of the Block Management System to
identify new taxpayers and enhance voluntary compliance on the existing ones, development of a
robust revenue forecasting model, establishment of a data warehouse and taxpayer education
campaigns. Several studies have been conducted and recommendations made on reduction of the
level of exemptions.

2.3     Institutional Strengthening of TRA

The first Corporate Plan was mainly focused on institutional and capacity building which became
a success under TAP and has been carried forward as TRA implements the Second Corporate
Plan. Implementation of this component saw the strengthening of several departments that
include Income Tax and VAT departments, Customs and Excise, Tax Investigation, Human
Resource and Administration, Research and Policy, Large Taxpayers, Information Systems as
well as Taxpayer Service and Education Departments. A number of other areas have been
strengthened that include Training and Human Resource, Anti-Corruption, Financial Reporting,
Corporate Planning and Performance Indicators.

2.4     Improving Administrative Infrastructure

This is an area where significant achievements have been made through TAP whereby TRA has
been able to construct 31 offices and rehabilitate/refurbish 8 buildings throughout the country.
Examples of completed works include Mapato House, Kinondoni, Kipata (Ilala), Arusha,
Mwanza, Zanzibar and Pemba offices as well as Segera Transit Station and Horohoro, Namanga,
Tunduma and Kasumulu Border Stations. This has improved significantly the working

Furthermore, a number of motor vehicles, motorcycles and patrol boats have been procured as
well as equipment such as computers, photocopiers and generators which have been distributed
across the country to facilitate revenue collection, improve efficiency as well as enhance service
delivery.

     3.0     MIDTERM REVIEW OF TAP

     TRA organized a Midterm review of TAP in May 16-17, 2003 in Arusha. Among the agreements
     reached with the Development Partners are as summarised below:

     3.1     Harmonization of assistance through the Basket Fund

     A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) and Operational Manual between the Government of
     Tanzania and Development Partners was prepared and became operational with the signing of the
     same by the Governments of Tanzania, Denmark and European Union in 2005 and later by the
     World Bank in 2006. TMP Assistance has been harmonized through the Basket Fund whereby
     Development Partners approve the annual work plan and disburse funds into the basket for the
     implementation of all activities. Implementation of this arrangement is rated Highly Satisfactory
     because it is a move away from the previous system whereby Development Partners were
     selecting specific activities or departments to provide financial assistance.

     3.2     Overall framework for assistance to the TRA Corporate Plan 2003/042007/08

     Following the approval of the 2nd TRA five year Corporate Plan 2003/04  2007/08, Development
     partners endorsed it as an overall framework for assistance for TMP. Annual Work Plans and
     Budget as well as annual Procurement Plans are prepared in line with the Corporate Plan.
     Implementation of this agreement is rated Highly Satisfactory because it has streamlined the
     overall Development Partner assistance to be similar to the internal TRA budgetary framework
     under the Activity Based Budget.

     3.3     Quarterly reporting on activities and performance indicators

     In accordance to the Operational Manual of the Moue, TRA prepares quarterly reports on
     implementation of activities in the Corporate Plan as well as on the agreed performance indicators.
     The same reports submitted to the TRA Management and the Board of Directors are also
     forwarded to Development Partners. Implementation of this agreement is rated Highly
     Satisfactory because it has streamlined overall reporting within TRA to various stakeholders.

3.4     Semi-Annual Joint Steering Committee meetings

A Joint Steering Committee (DISC) that draws membership from the Ministry of Finance,
Development Partners, Zanzibar Revenue Board (ZRB) and TRA was formed under the
Chairmanship of the TRA Commissioner General and the first meeting was held in June 2005.
Implementation of this agreement is rated Highly Satisfactory because since then the meetings
have been conducted regularly following completion of the semi-annual Multi-Development
Partner Missions.

3.5     Improve overall efficiency and effectives of revenue collection in Zanzibar.

Development Partners have agreed to provide assistance to the Zanzibar Revenue Board (ZRB)
through the TMP Basket Fund by including ZRB activities in the TRA investment and
procurement plans. The activities are as stipulated in the ZRB Corporate Plan 2005/06  2009/10.
Additionally, TRA and ZRB signed an Moue in March 2004 to officiate cooperation between the
two institutions. Implementation of this arrangement is rated Satisfactory because ZRB has
increased its revenue collections from Shs 29.3 billion in 2003/04 to 44.3 billion in 2005/06. The
trend of revenue collection in Zanzibar as collected by ZRB for the five year period is as
summarised below:

ZRB has established a Large Taxpayer Office (LOT) with effect from 1st January 2007 and up to
March 2007, the LOT is administering 47 large taxpayers who contribute about 60% of total ZRB
collections.



4.0     NEW OBJECTIVES OF TAP/TMP AND INDICATORS

Following the approval of the TRA Corporate Plan and commencement of its implementation in
July 2003, Development partners joined the Basket Fund and agreed on the new objectives and
focus of TRA and hence moved from TAP to the Tax Modernization Programmed (TMP) to
mirror TRA's Vision of being "a Modern Tax Administration by 2008".

The Development Partners who initially signed the TMP Moue are Government of the United
Republic of Tanzania (February 2005), Government of Denmark (April 2005), European Union
(March 2005) and DFID (June 2005). The objectives of TMP which were also adopted by the
World Bank although it had not yet joined the Basket fund in July 2003, were based on the five
strategic goals under the TRA Corporate Plan namely:-
              Increase Revenue in a Cost effective way
              Integrate TRA operations
              Provision of high quality and responsive Customer Service


                                             34

              Promote compliance through a fair, equitable and transparent application of tax
                  laws
              Improve staff competence, motivation, integrity and accountability

        The focus of the Second Corporate Plan is a response to the Government's directive of
        making TRA Taxpayer and Investor friendly to enable it collect revenue to capacity
        levels. Additionally, new indicators were developed as shown in Appendix 3 which focus
        on:-
             Nature and scope of operations
             Effectiveness
             Efficiency
             Perception Indicators

        It should be noted that TAP was expected to end in December 2004. Having implemented
        the project for over four-years, some of the project components especially the Civil
        Works had not been completed. This necessitated an extension of TAP up to June 2006
        and additional six months extension was provided to the end of December 2006.
        However, during the TAP extension, TMP PDOs were being monitored parallel with the
        TAP PDOs.

5.0     ASSESSMENT

TAP's overall objectives have been met during the duration of the Project. A number of reforms
have been undertaken by TRA in areas of Improving the Legal Framework, Broadening the Tax
Base, Strengthening TRA and Improving Administrative Infrastructure.

5.1     Implementation Support of TAP

The World Bank and other Development Partners have been conducting Multi-Development
Partner Missions for TAP on semi-annual basis. These have been for assessing progress made on
the project implementation plans for each Department. The Development Partners on the other
hand develop an Aide-Memoir after every Mission in which agreements are made on
improvements to various areas of the TAP objectives. Progress made on the agreements is
reported on quarterly basis as well as during the Supervision Missions.

This arrangement has proceeded with the implementation of the TMP and is expected to continue
as the framework for supervision and reporting of the Corporate Plan. Reports which are sent to
the Development Partners are the same reports used for internal TRA purposes. This is in line
with the TMP Memorandum of Understanding as well as the TMP Operational Manual.
Coordination through a TMP Joint Steering Committee (DISC) has enabled the Supervision
Missions to be more transparent as it involves stakeholders from the Ministry of Finance, Basket
Fund Development Partners, TRA and ZRB

5.2     Financing under TAP

The IDA funded TAP was approved for the amount of US$40 million and signed between the
Government and IDA in August 1999. As already stated, TAP became operational in March 2000
and was originally expected to end in December 2004. Some components of the project,
particularly civil works, had not been completed which necessitated an extension of up to June
2006. TRA requested for another extension up to December 2006 and a withdrawal grace period


                                               35

of up to April 2007. As at March 2007, TAP had disbursed 93.8 percent of the credit. The
activities to cover the remaining credit will be funded under TMP. In view of that, disbursements
and use of funds has been consistently satisfactory.

5.3      Procurement under TAP

Procurement has been undertaken in a consistent satisfactory manner following the approved
procurement plans for the respective years. This is evident in the 93.8 percent disbursement of the
credit which indicates the performance of the planned procurement activities for the credit.
Although implementation of the 2006/07 Procurement Plan for the TAP  IDA component was
not completed as at the closing of the project in December 2006, these activities will be procured
using the TMP funds. The main outstanding activities under the TAP included procurement of
various Information and Communication Technology (ACT) hardware and software.

In order to shorten and streamline the procurement process for future IDA funded projects, the
following recommendations may be considered:-
      There should be an agreed time frame for the World Bank to review documents and
         respond to the beneficiary. It is recommended that two weeks may be the ideal time for
         feedback.
      Increase thresholds for review of documents prior to provision of No Objection so as to
         reduce the lag time while waiting for the reviews.
      As World Bank procurement procedures are constantly being reviewed, we recommend
         that the World Bank should ensure that the beneficiaries are regularly trained on the new
         procedures in order to enable them to carry their activities smoothly.

6.0      SUSTAINABILITY

As noted earlier, since 2005, Development Partners and TRA are implementing the TMP through
the Basket Fund arrangement. The TMP Basket Fund has a total of US$33.6 million out of which
US$ 12.0 million is IDA credit. This has been working in parallel with the TAP-IDA credit until
December 2006 when TAP officially came to an end. The World Bank signed the Moue of the
Basket Fund in December 2006. The funding under TMP will be available until June 2009 when
TMP Basket fund comes to an end.

a)       General Budget Support. Future TRA funding of initiatives will be covered by its
recurrent expenditure through the General Budget Support which is in line with the 2005 Paris
Declaration on Harmonization of Development Partners Support. TRA uses the Corporate Plan
which is approved by the Management, Board and agreed upon by Development Partners as the
framework for provision of assistance. The Corporate Plan which is a working document will
continue to be used as a framework for assistance under the General Budget Support to ensure
sustainable financing of TRA reform efforts.

b)       Asset Replacement Fund. In an effort to ensure sustainability in carrying out TRA
initiatives, the Government of Tanzania has committed itself by setting aside on annual basis a
total of Shs 2 billion as Asset Replacement Reserve. This amount has been set aside since
2004/05 and is specifically aimed at replenishing worn out assets in order to ensure sustainability.

c)       Mainstreaming. Project Coordination has been mainstreamed within TRA whereby all
Project/Programmed activities are coordinated by TRA staff who have other assignments within
the organization. Additionally, TRA uses its own systems and reports for Programmed reporting


                                               36

hence reports forwarded to Development Partners and the same reports forwarded to TRA Board
of Directors and other stakeholders. This ensures sustainability in any other arrangement that
TRA is going to have in the future as there will be no change in "modus operandi" after the
expiration of the TAP/TMP.
