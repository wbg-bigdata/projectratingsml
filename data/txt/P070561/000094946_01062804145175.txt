REPUBLIC OF TURKEY  FOR OFFICL USE ONLY
PROGRAMMATIC FINANCIAL AND PUBLIC SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
LOAN SUMMARY
Borrower:                    The Republic of Turkey
Amount:                     US$1.1 billion
Terms:                      US$700 million on standard IBRD terms, payable in 17 years
including 5 years of grace and level principal repayment, at six
months LIBOR for US Dollars plus variable spread for
Variable Single Currency Loans; and US$400 million on
special structural adjustment loan (SSAL) terms, payable in 5
years including 3 years of grace and level principal repayment,
at six months LIBOR for US Dollar plus 400 basis points.
Front end fee:               I percent of Loan amountsFN
Commitment Fee:             0.75 percent on undisbursed loan balances, beginning 60 days
after signing, less any waiver on US$700 million amount on
standard IBRD terms. On the US$400 million amount on
SSAL terms, there are no waivers of interest or commitment
charges.
Objectives and Description:    The proposed Programmatic Financial and Public Sector
Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL) is the first Loan in support of the
Govemment's multi-year financial and public sector reform
program. It is envisaged that the proposed PFPSAL will be
followed by a second Programmatic Financial and Public
Sector Adjustment Loan (PEPSAL II) of US$1.35 billion
(US$550 million on standard IBRD terms and US$800 million
on SSAL terms), tentatively planned for December 2001. The
main objective of the proposed PFPSAL is to address the
Government's immediate financial and public sector reform
pnorities in the aftermath of the November 2000 and February
2001 financial cnrses, while ensuring that social programs
continue to be adequately funded. Key priorities include, in the
financial sector: (i) overhaul of the regulatory framework for
banking activity, (ii) institutional development of the new Bank
Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), (iii) problem
FN Pending approval by the Executive Directors, US$3.85 million of the front-end fee would be waived on an
exceptional basis (see paragraph 98).

bank/bank failure resolution, and (iv) state bank restructuring
and privatization; and in the public sector: (a) structural fiscal
policies, (b) public expenditure management, (c) financial
accountability, (d) public liability management, and (e) public
sector governance. The PFPSAL will provide budgetary
support to help the Government finance the costs arising from
the crisis while continuing to fund its critical social programs.
Benefits:                     The principal benefits of the Loan will be to: (i) restore
confidence in the banking system and in the Government's
ability to implement and sustain the required sizeable fiscal
adjustments following the November 2000 and February 2001
crises; (ii) strengthen the foundation for an efficient and sound
banking system which can be competitive in quality and
performance at the international level; (iii) reduce the
vulnerability of the banking system and enhance its capacity to
withstand external shocks and thereby reduce systemic failure
risk; (iv) position Turkey's banking sector for accession to the
European Union (EU) by starting the process of aligning the
prudential regime for the banking system with applicable EU
banking sector directives; (v) support urgent fiscal measures to
respond to the crisis while ensuring that social spending is
protected; (vi) lay the foundation for sustained fiscal
adjustment; and (vii) modernize the public sector through
actions to improve management of public expenditure and
liabilities, ensure financial accountability in line with
international standards, and raise the quality of public sector
governance.
Risks:                        The risks associated with the Government's financial and
public sector reform program arise from macroeconomic
factors, a potential loss of political consensus and institutional
weaknesses. The key macroeconomic risk is that interest rates
will remain higher than projected which would affect the
sustainability of the public debt and create the conditions for
renewed instability. Given the severity of the February 2001
crisis, Turkey will remain vulnerable to both internal and
external shocks over the medium term. The comnrmercialization
and privatization of the state-owned banks will be a major
political and organizational challenge for the Government. The
closure of Emlak and the rapid restructuring of Halk and Ziraat
will also have significant fiscal and social implications.
Another risk is that of possible inability to raise sufficient
resources to finance the restructuring of the state banks and the
resolution of the banks under the Savings Deposit Insurance
Fund (SDIF). Tight fiscal discipline and the confidence of



domestic and international investors in Turkish sovereign debt
instruments will be essential here. Finally, satisfactory and
timely failure resolution efforts by the SDIF (for already
intervened banks) and enforcement of capital restoration plans
by the BRSA (for non-intervened banks) are important; the risk
that such efforts will fall short of what is needed is related to
the political pressure that may be put on these agencies for a
slowdown of regulatory enforcement action and general
regulatory forbearance. The public sector reform agenda is
politically sensitive and may be jeopardized by resistance of
vested interest groups that would prefer to maintain the status
quo. Capacity constraints and crisis management efforts at key
Government agencies, such as the Ministry of Finance and
Undersecretariat of Treasury, may also slow down the pace of
the envisaged public sector reforms.
Schedule of Disbursements:    US$1.1 billion, including a 1 percent fee (see footnote in page
1 of the Loan Summary) to be paid to the IBRD, immediately
after loan effectiveness - expected July 2001.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE
INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
PROGRAMMATIC FINANCIAL AND PUBLIC SECTOR ADJUSTMENT LOAN
TO THE REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
1.    I submit for your approval the following Report and Recommendation on a proposed
Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL) to the Republic of
Turkey for US$1.1 billion to support the Government's multi-year financial and public sector
program aimed at restoring confidence in the banking system and correcting the underlying
structural problems in the public sector that created the conditions under which financial crises
like those that hit Turkey in November 2000 and February 2001 could occur. The proposed loan
will be in US Dollar Single Currency, partly on standard IBRD terrns (US$700 million) and
partly on special structural adjustment loan terms (US$400 million). The loan will be disbursed
in a single tranche immediately upon effectiveness--including fulfillment of the special
effectiveness condition on the revocation of Emlak Bank's license and completion of its merger
with Ziraat Bank and Halk Bank.
2.    The proposed PFPSAL is the first in a series of two programmatic loans to be
implemented over the remainder of 2001 in support of the Government's new economic program
in response to the financial crisis. This loan is the first operation to support Turkey's program
for comprehensive reformn of the financial and public sectors. The PFPSAL would be followed
by a second Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL II) of
US$1.35 billion (US$550 million on standard IBRD terms and US$800 million on SSAL termns).
Under the PFPSAL program, the World Bank would disburse US$2.45 billion in adjustment
lending in 2001 to meet Turkey's external and budgetary financing requirements arising from the
crisis, and to support its short and medium term reform goals in the financial and public sectors.
Bank support for sustained implementation of reform in the financial and public sectors would
continue in 2002-03 in the high case lending scenario through a series of new programmatic
loans under the restructured CAS as described in the CAS Progress Report scheduled to be
discussed by the Board on June 29, 2001 (Report No. 22282-TU).  Specifically, two
Programmatic Financial Sector Adjustment Loans (PFSAL I and II) of US$500 million each and
a Programmatic Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PPSAL) are envisaged. A second PPSAL is
tentatively envisaged in late 2003 beyond the current CAS period.
I.    INTRODUCTION
A.   Recent Economic Developments
3.   In late February 2001, Turkey experienced a major currency crisis which forced the
Government to abandon the exchange rate based disinflation program and float the Lira. The
immediate cause of the crisis is attributable to weaknesses in the financial sector, but its deeper
roots lie in the structure and management of the public sector which are at the core of Turkey's
chronic macroeconomic instability. The combination of an oversized public sector living beyond
its means and inadequate management of existing resources has generated structural imbalances



- 2 -
which have thwarted successive attempts at disinflation (Figure 1). These imbalances and the
constant search for financing have become intertwined with financial sector weaknesses in a
vicious circle. The state banks were traditionally used to finance Government-mandated
subsidized lending to agriculture and SMEs (resulting in the so called "duty losses"- these were
the  annually  compounded                 Figure 1: TURKEY: PSBR and Interest Payments

from     investments    in
Government paper. Faced with prohibitively high interest rates, the Government traditionally
relied on the inflation tax to keep the public debt under control. However, this created a deeply
ingrained pattern of inflationary expectations which has blocked financial sector deepening and
promoted steadily increasing currency substitution (Figure 2).
4.     The disinflation program launched in late 1999 based on a nominal exchange rate anchor
was a bold and risky attempt               Figure 2: Turkey: CPI Inflation and M2/GNP
to  break  the  unsustainable
cycle  of inflation, financial  1  150        --                                         30.00

passed in December 1999 that
called for the creation of a new independent bank regulatory agency, initiated a much needed
overhaul of the banking sector regulatory regime and enhanced the powers of the SDIF, the



- 3 -
agency responsible for bank failure resolution and administration of the deposit insurance
scheme. Immediately after passage of the new law, the SDIF intervened in 5 private banks.
However, the Government had difficulty maintaining the pace of reform implementation. After
some early success including a rapid decline in interest rates, there was soon resistance to change
from within the governing coalition. As implementation progressed during the course of 2000,
resistance to particular aspects of the program became more pronounced. The macroeconomic
risks quickly built up and the program eventually collapsed at its weakest point, the financial
sector.
5.    Although, as mentioned above, the legal and regulatory framework for the banking sector
was improved prior to the crisis, progress was slow  in resolving the SDIF banks or in
restructuring the state-owned banks
which remained subject to political              Figure 3: Duty Losses of State Banks
control.  The SDIF banks were
kept open throughout 2000, and
little  headway  was  made  in         12
restructuring  the  state  banks.

external borrowing to finance their
en         Government secun'ty purchases given the incentive structure created by the crawling peg and
associated quasi-currency board rules. As a result, many banks were continuously maintaining
their open FX positions at or near the maximum allowable limits or, in some instances, found
ways around these limits through the use of balance sheet window dressing and structured
finance products (see also paragraph 36), enhancing their vulnerability to exchange rate shocks.
The open FX positions were particularly large in the SDIF banks, as they offered premium rates
on foreign exchange deposits in order to fund their continuing operations. At the same time, the
stock of duty losses continued to snowball (Figure 3). A first round of acute financial turmoil in
November 2000 demonstrated the vulnerability of the Turkish banking sector to interest rate
risks, caused among others by the mismatch between the maturity of assets and liabilities which
had built up as a result of past macroeconomic distortions and inadequate banking supervision
and enforcement. The Government tried to accelerate financial sector reform in response to the
November turmoil and new legislation for restructuring and privatization of the state banks was
adopted. However, this came too late to prevent the full-fledged financial crisis of February
2001.

6.     The underlying problems with the structure and management of the public sector have
been analyzed in detail in the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM) on Structural Reforms
for Sustainable Growth (Report No. 20657-TU, September 2000) and the Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review (PEIR) discussed with the Government in May 2001. Table 1 shows that
Turkey's public sector is large relative to OECD comparators such as Spain and Portugal, and
that public spending has greatly exceeded available resources. Countries like Germany and Italy,
with comparably high levels of expenditure sustain this with much greater revenue effort and
therefore run much smaller deficits.   Central to this problem  is extensive Government
intervention throughout the economy and an under performing   system  of public sector
management. The first dimension of the problem is being addressed though the on-going
structural reforms to the social security system, to modernize agriculture support policies,
deregulate energy and telecommunications, and implement privatization. The second dimension
arises from the long neglect of the need to modernize the procedures and institutions which
govern decision-making and resource allocation in the public sector. The impact of many years
of weak fiscal discipline and poor expenditure management is also reflected in the composition
of public expenditure. As shown in Figure 4, the share of public spending on interest payments
and wages and salaries in Turkey varies greatly from almost all of its OECD counterparts. This
difference is inconsistent with the objectives of sustained economic growth and equity.
7.     Turkey must tackle adjustment and reform  simultaneously in the financial and public
sectors in the aftermath of the crisis. The costs of cleaning up the banking sector has added over
US$40 billion to the Treasury's debt although about half of this represents losses on the books of



- 5 -
the state and SDIF banks before the crisis which were already included in the broader definition
of the public debt. Interest rates have fallen from the levels prevailing immediately after the
February crisis, but remain well above pre-crisis levels and the sustainability of the public debt is
at increased risk. Restoring investor confidence depends critically on rebuilding the credibility
of the reform program. This in turn requires decisive action to correct the underlying structural
weaknesses in the financial sector, while at the same time undertaking urgent financial
restructuring to address the impact of the crisis on the banks. In parallel, institutional and policy
reforms are needed to address systemic problems in the public sector, together with stronger
structural measures to underpin the fiscal adjustment. These reforms will complement on-going
actions to improve the climate for private investment and promote growth. Turkey needs these
comprehensive reforms to break definitively with its troubled history of public deficits, inflation
and financial instability.

B.    The Government's New Economic Program
8.       The Government has prepared a new economic program that aims to minimize the short-
term impact of the crises while setting the stage for an early resumption of disinflation and
growth. The program targets a more gradual disinflation path, but a more aggressive push on
structural reformns. By moving immediately to address the fundamental structural problems
underlying the criss, with a strong focus on restructuring the banking sector, the Governent
hopes to engineer a quick recovery closer to the experience of Brazil and Korea, and avoid the



- 6 -
prolonged recession that some other crisis countries have experienced. The program is based on
a three-pronged strategy: (i) macroeconomic policies geared towards restoring financial stability
and resuming the disinflation process; (ii) structural policies aimed at correcting the financial
sector and public sector weaknesses underlying the crisis and establishing a more sound basis for
disinflation and growth; and (iii) strong social policies including enhanced social dialogue to
achieve price and wage policies consistent with macroeconomic stability, and increased
emphasis on the protection of the most vulnerable groups of society.

9.     The macroeconomic targets are necessarily ambitious.  The principal macroeconomic
objectives of the new program are: first, to contain the impact of the collapse of the crawling peg
and subsequent devaluation of the TL; and second, to resume a path of progressively lower
inflation and increasingly sustainable growth.
*  CPI inflation is targeted fall to  about 2 percent per month (seasonally adjusted) by the last
quarter of 2001 giving a cumulative 52.5 percent for the year (Table 2); inflation is targeted
to fall to 20 percent in 2002 and 15 percent in 2003;
*  Interest rates on Government securities, in the 180 percent range immediately after the
February 2001 crisis, are targeted to fall to 50 percent by December, resulting in average real
rates of some 36 percent for the year; interest rates are expected to fall further in 2002-03;



*  A primary surplus for the consolidated public sector of 5.5 percent of GNP is targeted. This
compares to a surplus of 2.8 percent in 2000; the primary surplus is targeted to increase to
6.5 percent of GNP in 2002-03;
*  Monetary policy will focus in the short terrn on containing the inflationary impact of the
cnsis. Inflation targeting will be introduced in the near future under the new Central Bank
law enacted in May 2001. The exchange rate will be allowed to adjust freely to ensure
external competitiveness;
*  Incomes policy will be a key nominal anchor. Civil service wages are expected to remain
broadly constant in real terms. However, real wages for public sector workers, which
increased by about 43 percent in real terms in 1999-2000, will fall. The Government's
dialogue on incomes policy with its social partners will be strengthened under the Economic
and Social Council law enacted in April 2001;
*  The economy is expected to contract sharply during the first semester before recovery begins
during the second semester as confidence improves, resulting in a fall of GNP by 3 percent
for the year; the economy is projected to recover strongly in 2002-03.

10.    Success of the new  program  depends critically on the ability of the Government to
simultaneously finance the costs of cleaning up the banking sector while achieving the targeted
reduction in interest rates. This requires keeping public finances on a sustainable path despite the
February crisis. To finance the bank clean up, in the period up to and including May 15, 2001,
the Treasury issued TL 49.60 quadrillion in marketable Government securities and TL 326



- 8 -
trillion in cash, giving a total outlay of TL 49.92 quadrillion. This amount includes TL 6.62
quadrillion issued prior to 2001, of which TL 2.78 quadrillion to the state banks (reissued as
marketable securities in 2001) and TL 3.84 quadrillion to the SDIF banks. It also includes the
reissuance of additional non-marketable securities given to Ziraat and Halk in early 2001 pnror to
the crisis, and the replacement of low-interest securities on the books of the SDIF banks to allow
these banks to meet their funding costs (see Table 3). While the total outlay for bank
restructuring as of mid May was TL 49.9 quadrillion, the net increase in the public debt stock in
2001 has been only TL 24.3 quadrillion given that the state bank duty losses (TL 21.8
quadrillion) and securities issued to the SDIF banks in 2000 (TL 3.8 quadrillion) as well as the
low-interest securities replaced on the books of the SDIF banks (TL 3.46 quadrillion) were
already included in the public debt figures for end-2000. The program estimates that the stock of
Treasury securities issued for bank restructuring will reach up to TL 54 quadrillion (30 percent
of GNP) by the end of 2001, including revaluation of FX denominated securities and a
contingency for possible additional costs of bank restructuring which may arise.
11.   Together with the impact of higher interest rates and recession induced by the crisis, the
costs of bank restructuring will push the stock of net public debt (including CBT net assets) from
58 percent of GNP at the end of           Figure 5: Public Sector Net Debt and Real Interest Rates
2000 to a projected 79 percent by
the end of 2001, a level at the limit   90.00                          -   --   - -        40

interest rates that the Treasury
must undertake and eases the pressure on domestic interest rates. However, even with this large
package of extermal support, the stock of public debt is projected to increase sharply in 2001.
Clearly, there is no room for complacency on the part of the Government.
12.   Achieving the program scenario will require fundamental restructuring of the Turkish
economy, most importantly a transformation of the roles of the State and the private sector.
There are three core directions for structural reform. The first is a major acceleration of financial
sector reform, first to respond to the crisis and then to realize the structural changes required to
wean the banking sector from a dependence on high interest rates on Government paper. The
second core direction is comprehensive public sector reform to address the underlying structural
causes of the Government deficit and to increase the transparency and efficiency of public
expenditure management. The third direction is continuation of vital reforms in the agriculture.



energy and telecommunications sectors to improve the climate for private investment in an effort
to raise productivity, growth and incomes.
13.   The Govermment has reached agreement with the IMF on the revised macroeconomic
framework and policy package for 2001, including a detailed program of structural reforms
worked out in collaboration with the Bank. This agreement cleared the way for completion of
the 6th and 7th reviews of the Stand-by Arrangement which resulted in the disbursement of SDR 3
billion (US$3.9 billion) on May 15, 2001. An augmentation of the Stand-by amount with SDR
6.36 billion was also approved which brings total IMF support for the program to SDR 15 billion
(over US$19 billion), including the SDR 5.8 billion (US$7.5 billion) Supplemental Reserve
Facility (SRF) approved in December 2000. The IMF program has been prepared in close
cooperation with the Bank. The prior actions, performance criteria and structural benchmarks
for the Stand-by are fully consistent with the Bank's Economic Reform Loan (ERL) and
Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) approved by the Board in May and December 2000
respectively, and the program to be supported by the proposed PFPSAL. The 8th Stand-by
review is scheduled to be completed by end-June.
C.    Social and Poverty Impact of the Crisis and Reform Program
14.   The social impact of the crisis is already being felt as lay-offs, rising prices, and negative
growth reduce household incomes and place a growing risk of poverty and vulnerability on
people already at the lower end of the income scale. This is contributing to the wider recognition
among the population, civil society and the private sector that de-politicization of economic
decision-making is an urgent task for the Government.  It is still early to provide a
comprehensive social assessment of the crisis, but initial indications are worrisome. The Turkey:
Economic Reforms, Living Standards and Social Welfare Study published in January 2000
(report no. 20029-TU), demonstrated that in the 1980s and 1990s, "non-anticipated jumps in
inflation or periods of accelerating inflation have unambiguously hurt the poor and worsened the
distribution." Although data is not yet available to track the impact of the jump in inflation
following the February 2001 crisis, it is safe to assume that the poor are being especially hard-
hit. The landless poor in rural areas have been affected by a decline in construction and other
informal job opportunities. Meanwhile the poor with land are beset by increased input costs due
to inflation. It will take some further weeks to fully evaluate the impact of the crisis and ongoing
reform program on the poor. Data from SIS indicate an unemployment rate of 8.6 percent in the
first quarter of 2001, a jump of more than two percentage points over the last quarter of 2000.
Fieldwork in May for the Corporate Sector Assessment (see Part IV) indicates that:
*     Industry's initial perception is that the crisis is unprecedented in its severity in
comparison to previous crisis due, in part, to the spillover effects of the problems caused by the
Russian crisis in 1998-1999 and earthquakes in 1999 and the November 2000 crisis.
*     SMEs are laying off workers (some 65 percent of SMEs surveyed) according to both
surveys and interviews, while larger firms are using accelerated vacation schedules, short work
weeks and other methods to avoid formalized layoffs. Were the crisis to go beyond the summer,
without signs of pick-up, most industrialists indicated that they would be forced into formal
layoffs.



- 10-
*      Both banks and business owners confirm that credit is generally not available, except to
the best customers and even then for 90 days or less. Interest rates are very high, in US dollar
terms at 15-18 percent. Lease financing and factoring have largely dried up.
15.   The financial and public sector reforms that would be supported by the PFPSAL program
will have important social benefits and will support the Government's poverty reduction efforts.
These structural reforms are designed to help pull the economy out of recession and restore
growth as soon as possible which is the key to minimizing job loss, and the social and poverty
impact of the crisis. Restored confidence in the financial sector will help reverse the on-going
credit crunch and generate new resources for economic recovery and job creation. The public
sector reforms will help ensure the quality of the fiscal adjustment and improve overall
efficiency of social service delivery. Better public expenditure management will increase the
availability of resources for social expenditure. Actions to upgrade the operational performance
of line ministries and agencies, including increased emphasis on policy formulation and a
progressive shift to performance budgeting, will help ensure that these additional resources are
used effectively to fight poverty and vulnerability. The program features institutional and policy
measures to improve the operational performnance of line ministries and agencies including those
responsible for basic social services. Action under the program to improve public governance
and tackle corruption are likely to benefit the poor disproportionately as shown in numerous
international studies. Structural reform of the financial and public sectors is also crucial to avoid
future crisis which would likely be devastating for the poor.
16.   However, the financial and public sector reforms do entail some short-term social costs
which must be mitigated. Resolution of SDIF banks has entailed loss of almost 10,000 jobs as of
May 2001, and further layoffs are expected among the remaining 18,000 employees. These
workers are eligible for severance payments under the law, but are not eligible for early
retirement benefits. Bank estimates are that restructuring and privatization of the state banks will
lead to a downsizing of staff by some 25,000-30,000 - or 0.25 percent of total permanent, non-
agriculture employment of about 11 million - through retirement, voluntary separation or
reassignment. These workers are civil servants and public sector workers who will benefit from
relatively generous retirement and severance payment provisions financed by the Government'.
Similar provisions will apply to those laid off or retired under programs to adjust staffing levels
in the broader public sector, including public sector workers affected by privatization. Over the
past six years, a total of some 16,000 workers have been laid off under the program of the
Privatization Administration. A social impact assessment prepared for the ERL and the Bank
supported Privatization Social Support Project (PSSP) estimated that roughly 48,000 additional
employees could be laid off or take early retirement as a result of the privatization program,
although this estimate is subject to change following the crisis. These employees would benefit
from the social protection provisions mentioned above in addition to special compensation under
the privatization law Described in the PSSP documentation. All formal sector workers will
benefit from the new unemployment insurance system launched in mid 2000, once they meet the
minimum contribution history requirement of 18 months.
The Government has prepared draft legislation which would provide an additional lump-sum retirement bonus to
civil servants in the state banks who retire before the end of 2002. Under this legislation, staff in Emlak Bank would
be allowed to transfer their retirement plans to the public pension fund.

1/ Supplementary budget allocations for 2001.
17.    The Government is strengthening Turkey's social protection programs as detailed in the
CAS Progress Report and is committed to protecting social spending under the PFPSAL
program. Protecting expenditure on health, education and social protection from the impact of
the crises is a key social objective. Otherwise, Turkey's human capital will suffer and the burden
of adjustment will fall on vulnerable groups. A supplementary budget for 2001 was approved by
Parliament in June which is consistent with the Govenment's macroeconomic objectives and
also ensures adequate expenditure envelopes for health, education and social protection. The
budget maintains aggregate spending on education slightly above the average levels of 1998-
2000 (as a share of GNP) and programs a significant increase in expenditure on social protection
relative to 2000 resulting in part from the launch of the direct income support (DIS) program for
farmers. Overall public spending on health is also projected to remain above the 1998-2000
average level. Savings are expected to come from efficiency gains in health expenditures for
civil servants under the adininistrative reform of the social security system, but part of these
savings are being channeled into increased expenditure on preventive and primary care (Table
4)2 . The preliminary outcome for spending on health, education and social protection under the
2001 budget will be monitored in October. Benchmarks for public spending on health, education
and social protection as shares of GNP agreed with the Bank have been established for the
program (see Table 8 in Part IV). These benchmarks have been set at a level somewhat above
the averages for the 1998-2000 period, reflecting the Government's policy decision to ensure
2 The broader issues concerning the composition of public expenditure on health and education are addressed in the
Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR), while equity and efficiency issues concerning the social
protection system are analyzed in the Bank's Living Standards and Social Welfare Study dated January 27, 2000.

adequate expenditure on social priorities. Significant deviations from the program benchmarks
will be discussed with the Bank with the aim of determining appropnrate corrective action. The
Government is committed to allocating satisfactory expenditure envelopes for social programs
in the 2002 budget which will be a trigger for PFPSAL II.
D.    Initial Market Response to the Program
18.   Economic developments since the Government's new program was announced in April
have been mixed with a number of encouraging signs of response in the economy combined with
some signals of concem. Interest rates have fallen from post-crisis highs of 150-200 percent
which prevailed through mid-March to the 80 percent range in mid-June. However, they remain
above the projected path under the program, thereby increasing pressure on the public debt. This
is due in part to higher than expected inflation in April which saw an 10.3 percent increase in the
CPI and 14.4 percent in the WPI as prices adjusted to the devaluation. Inflation subsequently
subsided in May (5.1 percent CPI and 6.3 percent WPI) in a positive sign, but there is now a
possibility that inflation will exceed the year-end projection of 52.5 percent. Another important
factor has been market perceptions of differing opinions in the Cabinet over important aspects of
the program based on public statements of some ministers.  The coalition leaders have
periodically stressed their support for the program, but the market perceptions and public airing
of disagreements over certain reform actions have continued. Another factor affecting interest
rates had been anticipation and uncertainty over the terms of the debt swap which was
announced on June 12. Now that the swap operation has been completed, this uncertainty should
dissipate3. Higher than expected increases in public sector wages and cereal support prices,
while not threatening the fiscal balance, have impacted inflationary expectations. On the real
side, short-term indicators have pointed to a deepening recession. Industrial output fell 10.5
percent in April over a year earlier and there are clear indications of increased unemployment.
The capacity utilization rate declined to 68 percent in April compared to 71 percent in March and
77 percent in April 2000. At the same time, developments in the balance of payments are more
encouraging, imports fell some 25 percent year-on-year in March in US dollar terms and exports
increased by almost 10 percent leading to an improvement in the current account deficit. The
current account deficit for the first quarter was some US$565 million compared to US$2.3
billion in the first quarter of 2000. These developments in the balance of payments are in line
with the program projections. In the coming months, it will be essential to improve investor
confidence further in order to bring down inflationary expectations and interest rates in line with
the program projections. Sustained implementation of the financial and public sector reforms
supported by the PFPSAL and subsequent programmatic operations will be critical to this effort.
E.    Bank Support for Economic Reform
19.   The proposed PFPSAL is part of a broader package of Bank financing in support of the
Government's economic reform efforts. The Bank's overall lending program for the next three
years has been adjusted in response to the November 2000 and February 2001 macro-economic
3The Treasury has swapped TL 9.3 quadrillion of outstanding short-term TL securities (maturing in 2001-02) with
a basket of longer maturity FX-indexed (3 and 5 year) and TL-denorninated (1 and 2 year) bonds. The swap terms
were determined following an auction on June 15.

and banking crises. It is described in detail in the CAS Progress Report. The revised CAS
includes a high case lending program of US$5.0 billion plus US$1.2 billion on SSAL terms. The
program provides for adjustment lending of up to US$4.5 billion and up to US$1.7 billion in
financing for investment in support of economic reform and social priorities during the CAS
period. Simultaneously with Board approval of the proposed PFPSAL, the Government will
request the Bank to cancel the second tranche of the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL)
approved by the Board in December 2000. The conditionality for the second tranche of the
FSAL has been overtaken by the banking crises events, and the financial sector reform agenda
envisaged under the second tranche of this loan has been subsumed in the conditionality for the
proposal PFPSAL and the planned PFPSAL II. The Government's program meets all of the
triggers for the revised high case as presented in the CAS Progress Report.
20.   The proposed loan meets all of the criteria for both programmatic and SSAL lending:
Proerammatic Lendin .4 The proposed PFPSAL and follow-up programmatic loans would
support a medium-termn program of second generation structural, policy and institutional reforms
in the financial and public sectors. This program is designed to help prevent a future crisis by
tackling the deeper roots of the chronic financial instability in Turkey. The program will help
Turkey achieve sustainable poverty reduction through macroeconomic stability and growth. The
program is articulated in detail in the attached LDP and policy matrix. It includes well specified
triggers and monitoring indicators (see Part IV). It is grounded in the revised CAS and is closely
integrated with other elements of the CAS. The program is supported by extensive ESW
including analytical work on key fiduciary aspects of public expenditure management. The
presentation of a medium-term strategy for financial and public sector reform will help the
Government restore confidence by demonstrating how Turkey will resolve the underlying
structural weaknesses which led to the February crisis.
SSAL Lendinl.5 The provision of US$1.2 billion on SSAL terms (US$400 million under
PFPSAL and US$800 million under the proposed PFPSAL II) over and above the US$5 billion
CAS envelope is justified by the breadth and severity of the crisis, and its fundamental structural
dimension. The Bank's participation, in concert with the IMF, is helping the Government
articulate its program and is contributing to the restoration of market confidence, financial health
and growth. The Government's structural and macroeconomic policy package is satisfactory and
the Government has quickly developed a track record of implementation performance since the
program was announced in April, including completion of the 6th, 7th Stand-by program reviews
in May and progress towards completion of the 8th review expected by the end of June. The
proposed PFPSAL program is part of a concerted international support package centered on an
additional US$8 billion in exceptional financing from the IMF. An external financing plan is in
place which includes efforts to strengthen private sector involvement6 and projects a return of
private capital inflows in 2002-03. Under the high case lending program, IBRD debt outstanding
and disbursed would increase to US$9.2 billion or around 7.2 percent of the total IBRD portfolio

in 2003. Despite this rapid projected increase, IBRD exposure and IBRD debt service as a share
of exports of goods and non-factor services and as a share of total public debt service are
projected to remain within IBRD's guidelines.
21.   The Bank's programmatic assistance in support of financial and public sector reform in
Turkey is a graduated response conditioned on concrete actions taken by the Government. The
programmatic approach recognizes that the complex second generation policy and institutional
reforms that Turkey is undertaking must be sequenced over the medium term. It also takes into
account the uncertainties inherent in the current crisis conditions that Turkey faces and allows for
a reasonable degree of adaptability of the prograrn to unfolding events on the ground. The
proposed Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan is the first operation in
support of the Government's multi-year financial and public sector reform program. It is
envisaged that the proposed PFPSAL will be followed by a second PFPSAL of US$1.35 billion
tentatively planned for December 2001, as well as by two Programmatic Financial Sector
Adjustment Loans of US$500 million each and a Programmatic Public Sector Adjustment Loan
of US$375 million, all on standard IBRD terms, during 2002-03 to support the implementation
of the program. A second PPSAL is tentatively envisaged in late 2003 beyond the CAS period.
The actions taken in May-June for PFPSAL I and those expected to be taken in December for
PFPSAL II are specified in the attached policy matrix (Annex VI).
22.   The PFPSAL program is linked with other support for the Government's reform program
under the revised CAS. Further implementation of the energy and telecommunications reforms,
and the privatization program, is covered under the conditionality for the second tranche of the
ERL. Mitigation of the social costs of privatization is supported by the PSSP approved by the
Board in December 2000. The Agricultural Reform Implementation Project expected to be
presented to the Board in June 2001 will assist the Government in carrying out core aspects of
the agriculture reform program originally supported by the ERL, including further reform of
agriculture support policies which is an important element of the overall fiscal adjustment effort.
The Social Risk Mitigation Project under preparation will bolster the Government's efforts to
strengthen social assistance programs. Future support for basic and secondary education, and for
health, will support realization of the objectives of the broader public sector reform in key social
sectors.
23.   The financial and public sector programmatic lending operations are supported by several
targeted non-lending activities, including a Corporate Sector Assessment that is currently
underway to determine the impact of the crises on the corporate sector, and a Non-Bank
Financial Institutions (NBFI) study planned for early 2002 in support of the design of the PFSAL
I and II, which in addition to the finalization of the banking system reform agenda will focus on
NBFI issues. The content of the public sector reform program draws on analysis presented in the
CEM and the PEIR. It also benefits from the Bank's fiduciary sector work including the Country
Procurement Assessment Review (CPAR) discussed with the Govenment in early June 2001. A
Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) is under preparation and the public sector
component of the draft CFAA was incorporated into the PEIR.

II.    TURKEY'S FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM
A.    Financial Sector Profile/Recent Developments in the Banking Sector
24.   The Turkish financial sector consists of a predominant banking sector of 74 banks. Of
these, 56 are deposit taking banks and 18 are non-deposit taking investment and development
banks. Of the 56 deposit taking banks, 4 are state-owned, 8 (formally privately owned) are under
the SDIF7 (now quasi state-owned), 28 are privately Turkish owned and 16 are foreign owned.
The banks are complemented by 66 insurance companies, 128 securities trading companies, 216
mutual funds, 91 leasing and 100 factoring companies, and a limited number of hitherto
unfunded private pension schemes run by the banks and insurance companies for their own staff.
Most of the financial institutions are part of financial conglomerates, with the main group
commercial bank at the center of such conglomerates, and other bank and non-bank financial
institutions formed and managed as subsidiaries. Issues related to consolidated regulation and
supervision, financial reporting and comprehensive risk management are increasingly gaining
more relevance because of the prevalence of such group structures. However, even though the
non-bank financial institutions (NBFI) sector has begun to grow in Turkey in terms of size and
economic importance in recent years, and the regulatory oversight and sectoral development
issues for the NBFI segment of the financial system are increasing in importance, its relative size
and economic impact compared to the banking sector is still rather small (see Annex IIA).
25.   Banking Sector: 1990 - November 2000. So far as the banking sector is concerned,
beginning in the early 1980s the emphasis of the Government's initial reform efforts has been on
the development of a basic legal and regulatory infrastructure to facilitate ease of entry, and to
increase competition and growth. This triggered a rapid expansion of banking system assets in
Turkey during the 1990s, and in spite of the 1994-95 banking crisis, total system assets in
absolute terms tripled from US$57.9 billion in 1994 to US$156.4 billion as of end 2000, and also
increased substantially as a percentage of GNP from 39.2 in 1994 to 77.3 in 2000 (Table 5). The
introduction of 100 percent deposit insurance for household deposits in response to the 1994-95
crisis, coupled with the growth in demand for Government securities, permitted the banks to
generate a relatively high risk free real return on a large part of their asset base during the years
1994-1999. However, as a result of the initial success of the Government's disinflation program
in early/mid 2000, yields on Government paper fell sharply leaving many banks scrambling to
develop more traditional lines of business.
26.   The rapid growth in the size of the banking sector has also had some negative
consequences.   Prudential regulations and enforcement capacity have lagged behind
considerably, and there has been a significant proliferation of connected and insider lending and
excessive concentration of exposure and default risks. The explosive asset growth has allowed
banks to hide the deteriorating quality of a major proportion of their credit portfolios; while at
the same time credit risks have been significantly understated due to previous lenient loan loss
provisioning rules. Excesses in foreign currency exposures and in maturity transformation

banks were merged into the transition bank Sumer (see Box I for further details).

generating significant duration mismatches have also created enhanced foreign currency and
interest rate/liquidity risks in addition to the credit risks.

27.    Banking sector: post November 2000.                  Starting  in  late  November 2000, Turkey
experienced a banking system liquidity crisis which was triggered by the need of a medium-sized
private bank (Demir) to refinance an excessive stock of Government securities. Demir's liquidity
needs exacerbated the already apparent strains on the interbank market resulting from the
persistently high funding requirements of the large state banks (see paragraphs 58-59 below). In
early December, interest rates briefly spiked to levels above 1,900 percent. The impact of this
interest shock on the regulatory capital base of the banking system has been heavily concentrated
in the SDIF banks. The interest rate shock wiped out over half of the US$5.6 billion (TL 3.86
quadrillion) capital injection of Government bonds into these banks just prior to the crisis,
reflecting the high percentage of SDIF banks' assets in interest rate sensitive instruments,
resulting in a sharp increase in short term funding costs and needs. Outside the SDIF banks, the
state-owned banks (which until very recently were able to offset increased funding costs through
their duty loss accounts) and the investment and development banks suffered a relatively much
smaller erosion of their capital base.
28.     In February 2001, there was another, much more serious crisis that was ignited by the
public airing of tensions between the President and Prime Minister. This set off a new wave of



- 17 -
turbulence in the financial sector as investors liquidated TL positions and fled to US$ in
expectation of a full fledged political crisis. Interest rates once again spiked, this time as high as
6,200 percent, and with a rapid depletion of the Central Bank of Turkey's (CBT's) foreign
currency reserves apparent, the authorities were forced to float the TL.
29.   The main elements of the crisis impact consist of: (i) interest rate losses; (ii) losses
arising from the TL devaluation; and (iii) loan book deterioration losses due to corporate sector
distress resulting from the crises. Although the impact of these factors on each bank individually
depends on its liquidity and FX open position situation during the crises, as well as on the size
and composition of its loan book and its pre-crisis capital adequacy, the most recently available
regulatory data and stress test results indicate that the combined effect of these factors has eroded
most of the banking system's capital. Whether this insolvency is temporary and can be reversed
in a number of private banks through new capital injections from existing or new owners
depends upon the success of the revised macro-economic stabilization program. The strategy
agreed and implemented will determnine the depth and breadth of the secular decline in the
corporate and other economic sectors going forward, and hence decide the fate of the banking
sector in the near term.
30.   The Bank and the IMF worked closely with the Government during each of the crises and
together developed a consensus on the actions necessary to restore confidence to the financial
sector and to set the sector on a path of stable growth. Many of the elements of the strategy are a
continuation of the reforms proposed under the FSAL, and build upon the actions taken by the
Government under the FSAL program. The major elements of the new program are elaborated
below.
B.    Proposed Multi-Year Financial Sector Reform Program
31.   In the aftermath of the November 2000 and February 2001 banking crises, the
Government has committed itself to a significant acceleration and widening of the scope of the
financial sector reform effort already initiated as part of the FSAL. Such acceleration and
widening of the scope of the financial sector reform program is clearly necessary to restore
banking system confidence and put the banking system on a sustainable path towards
competitiveness at the international level and towards EU accession. As part of the widened
scope of its financial sector reform effort, and once the initial phase of immediate urgent post-
crises banking sector reform and restructuring activity is over, the Government will also
implement a comprehensive non-bank financial institutions reform program, to complement the
banking sector refonn effort. Currently, NBFI activity in Turkey is still limited (see Annex IIA).
However, it is anticipated that NBFI activity could grow significantly once the macro-economic
situation stabilizes. As banks are the key players in NBFI activity, and as it is anticipated that in
the aftermath of the banking crisis stronger, larger banks with a universal mandate will appear, a
proactive approach on the part of the Government will be necessary to manage the risks and
vulnerabilities of such rapid NBFI growth.
32.   As the experience in other crisis countries (e.g., East Asia, Latin America) has shown,
banking crises resolution efforts will take time. Therefore, the Government has structured its
financial sector reforrn effort in two phases, with the first phase focused primarily on
implementation of urgent banking system reform and restructuring efforts, and the second phase



- 18 -
focused more on the medium term broad based financial sector development agenda. As such,
this effort will stretch over multiple years.
33.   The initial phase of the Government's multi-year reform program will be supported by
the proposed PFPSAL and the planned PFPSAL II. The PFPSAL will support reform measures
in the following four areas: (i) acceleration of the overhaul of banking system prudential
regulation; (ii) institutional development of the new Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency
(BRSA); (iii) accelerated resolution of problem banks and failed banks already taken over by the
SDIF; and (iv) initiation of comprehensive financial and ownership restructuring of the four
major state-owned banks. These reform measures are described in more detail in the paragraphs
below and in the policy matrix for the PFPSAL (Annex VI). The planned PFPSAL II, for which
the benchmarks are outlined in the policy matrix, will focus on: (i) finalizing the overhaul of the
banking system prudential regime; (ii) continued institutional development of the BRSA and
initiation of a comprehensive institutional development effort at the Savings Deposit Insurance
Fund (SDIF); (iii) continuation/completion of the problem bank/failed bank resolution effort; and
(iv) further restructuring and privatization of the state-owned banks. The follow-up reform
efforts in the banking area (especially the completion of the state bank privatization effort) as
well as the reform efforts in the NBFI segment of the financial sector will be supported by two
additional programmatic financial sector adjustment loans during 2002 and early 2003.
C.    Strengthening the Regulatory Framework for Banking and NBFI Activity
34.   Until recently, Turkey's prudential regime for banking activity was seriously out of line
with Basle/EU standards and international best practice. The weakness in the prudential regime,
coupled with rapid banking system growth (Table 5 above), contributed to the appearance of
major vulnerabilities in the banking system to exchange rate, interest rate and credit risk shocks.
These vulnerabilities were already apparent even before the latest two crises, as evidenced by the
emergence of a sizeable pipeline of failed private banks under the SDIF (Box 1) and the
continued financial difficulties experienced by the state banks (Box 2). The authorities initiated
(from December 1999 onwards) an overhaul of the prudential regime as part of the program
supported by the FSAL. Under the proposed PFPSAL, this effort is being accelerated and it is
the Government's intention to complete the overhaul by late 2001/early 2002 under the planned
PFPSAL II, and the following PFSALs I & II in 2002 and early 2003. Specifically, concerning
the prudential regime for banks the Govermment already has undertaken and plans to undertake
during 2001-02 a number of reforms in this area which are described below.
35.   Loan Loss Provisioning Rule. The current loan loss provisioning rule was adopted by
the Council of Ministers (the responsible authority for issuing banking regulations before the
new BRSA was created) in December 1999 as a Board presentation condition for the FSAL. As
such, it was a major improvement over the previous, much more lenient rule. However, the rule
was still not fully in line with best practice standards. Remaining weaknesses included the
exemption from both classification and provisioning for the agricultural support loans made by
Ziraat bank (the state-owned agricultural bank), the use of a rigid collateral classification system,
the absence of a provisioning requirement for watch loans, and a still somewhat mechanical
application of the provisioning percentages. Additionally, specific provisioning requirements
could still not be treated by banks as a pre-tax expense, resulting in overpayment by banks of
taxes on sometimes non-existing profits. This unfavorable tax treatment discouraged banks from



- 19-
making the required provisions, and also further eroded their already small capital base. To
remedy these weaknesses, the BRSA will reissue in June the current loan loss provisioning rule
in its own name, while lifting the exemption from classification and provisioning for Ziraat's
agricultural reforrn loans. Additionally, the Parliament has enacted an amendment to the
banking law that clearly nominates all specific provisions to be made by banks under the new
BRSA loan loss provisioning rule as a tax deductible expense, retroactive to January 1. 2001. As
a benchmark for the planned PFPSAL II, the BRSA has agreed to further strengthen the loan loss
provisioning rule to address the other remaining deficiencies and to bring the rule fully in line
with international best practice standards.
36.   Large/Connected Exposures. As a Board presentation condition for the FSAL, the
December 1999 banking law introduced a new, lower limit for connected exposures by banks.
The law also introduced a phase-in period for banks to reach the new limit in a step-wise fashion
by the end of 2006. The BRSA was supposed to introduce through regulation a definition of
connected exposure in line with the applicable EU Directive to operationalize the new limit.
Resistance from the banking sector, however, and concern about the high number of banks that
would be out of compliance with the new limit on the basis of the EU definition of connected
exposures, resulted in inaction in this area. The two banking crises at the same time have further
highlighted the importance of accelerated reform in this area. Therefore, the Parliament has
enacted a further amendment to the banking law separating connected lending & derivative
exposures from equity exposures (i.e., equity ownership in non-financial entities), and
introducing a new separate limit for such non-financial equity exposures. This new limit, which
is consistent with the applicable EU Directive, will be phased in over a period of 8 Y2 years, to
be in full compliance with EU non-financial equity exposure levels by 2009. Additionally, the
latest banking law amendment also mandates the application of the exposure limits (for
connected lending/derivatives and non-financial equity) on both a solo and consolidated basis
(i.e.. to banks and their financial subsidiaries together). The BRSA will also issue in June the
new. EU Directive based definition of connected exposures called for by the banking law, as
well as the interim targets and time-table for banks to come stepwise into compliance with the
new non-financial equity exposure limits. Furthermore, the BRSA will by August 31, 2001 enter
into time-bound action plans with all banks out of compliance with the new limits.
37.   Foreign Exchange (FX) Exposure. During 1998-99, the maximum open FX position
limit for banks was reduced in a stepwise fashion from 50 percent of regulatory capital in June
1998 to 20 percent in October 1999. In December 1999, as a Board condition for the FSAL, the
limit also was made applicable on both a solo and consolidated basis. A new BRSA regulation
that will impose a capital charge on banks for their open FX positions was issued in February
2001. The new market risk charge regulation8 is fully in line with applicable Basle capital rules,
and will become effective on January 1, 2002 on a solo basis and July 1, 2002 on a consolidated
basis. While all these reform actions are steps in the right direction, the current regime still
8 This regulation was accompanied by another new BRSA regulation, also issued in February 2001, requiring banks
to develop and operationalize by January 1, 2002 comprehensive risk management systems and internal audit
functions to capture all banking risks on a solo and consolidated basis. The regulation allows for the possibility of a
one-time extension of this deadline by six months for those banks (e.g., large state-owned banks like Ziraat) that are
unlikely to be able to comply with the January 1, 2002 deadline due to the current backward state of their
information technology infrastructure.



- 20 -
contains several weaknesses. These include different reporting frequencies for open FX
positions (solo - weekly and monthly, consolidated - quarterly) and capital adequacy (solo and
consolidated - quarterly), balance sheet window dressing at reporting dates and the use of
structured finance products to run up open FX positions in circumvention of the 20 percent limit.
Additionally, the larger banks are lobbying the BRSA and the CBT, which has issued a liquidity
based foreign currency exposure rule, to lift the existing open FX position rules in anticipation of
the introduction of the market risk charge for FX risk on January 1, 2002. To address these
concerns, the BRSA will issue in June 2001: (i) an amendment to the capital adequacy rule
increasing the reporting frequency for both solo and consolidated capital from quarterly to
monthly; and (ii) an amendment to the consolidated FX position reporting rule to change the
reporting frequency from quarterly to monthly. During the next six months, the BRSA will work
jointly with the Treasury's NBFI and Insurance Department and the CMB to harmonize the
reporting frequency on all financial statements (i.e., financial statements of banks' financial
subsidiaries. As benchmarks for the planned PFPSAL II, the BRSA has also agreed to set up a
working group comprising BRSA staff, external auditors and banks to: (i) catalogue the use by
banks of structured finance products to incur FX exposures not captured by existing regulations,
and (ii) formulate remedial regulatory action to capture such exposures as necessary.
Furthermore, the BRSA will announce its intention to undertake surprise on-site examinations, in
coordination with foreign supervisors where necessary (i.e., for the foreign branches/subsidiaries
of Turkish banks abroad), to verify compliance with consolidated FX open position limits
between reporting dates. Finally, the BRSA and the CBT have committed not to lift the existing
foreign currency exposure limits until onsite examinations have confirmed that banks' risk
management systems and the market risk charge for FX risk, which becomes mandatory on
January 1, 2002, are functioning satisfactorily. As a benchmark for the planned PFPSAL II, the
BRSA will ensure satisfactory implementation of the action plans for banks with excess
connected lending/derivatives and non-financial equity exposures to reach compliance with the
new banking law limits.
38.   Repurchase Transactions. Turkey is unique in having a significant retail repurchase and
reverse repurchase agreement (repo/reverse repo) market. In most of the world, repos are
transacted on a wholesale basis, usually only between banks, other financial institutions or large
corporate treasuries for liquidity management purposes. Prior to December 2000, in order to
encourage secondary market liquidity, the repo/reverse repo market enjoyed more favorable
withholding tax treatment than deposit interest and made repos attractive instruments for retail
customers.  Following the amendment of the withholding tax rules in December 2000,
commercial banks in Turkey now primarily enter into repo contracts with their retail clients to
circumvent the CBT's reserve requirement on deposits. In February 2001, as repo interest rates
rose to as high as 6,200 percent per annum, a large numbers of customers cancelled time deposits
and moved into the highly lucrative repo market. The movement of funds from time deposits to
the overnight repo market obliged some banks to borrow more heavily on the interbank market,
further destabilizing the banking system. As a first step to curb repo activity, the Government in
June 2001 has set up a committee comprising of representatives of the Treasury, the BRSA, the
CBT, the CMB and the MOF to recommend measures (e.g., setting a minimum allowable size
for repo transactions, setting a liquidity requirement for repos, adjusting withholding taxes based
on the length of liability maturities, etc.) to reduce the risks caused by excessive use of retail
repos/short-term  liabilities in the banking sector.  Additionally, to further enhance the
transparency of the repo market, as benchmarks for the proposed PFPSAL II, the BRSA will



-21 -
require banks to bring repos on balance sheet as collateralized finance transactions by the end of
December 2001, and the Government will take the necessary measures to reduce the risks caused
by excessive use of retail repos, short-term liabilities in the banking sector taking into account
the recommendations of the committee. The Capital Markets Board at a later stage will also
introduce a regulation restricting repos to wholesale transactions, thereby creating further
incentives to investors to move their money into banking deposits or money market mutual
funds.
39.   Taxation and Corporate Law Reform to Encourage Merger and Consolidation in
the Financial Sector and to Facilitate Separation of Financial Industrial Groups. Because
of a past history of somewhat indiscriminate issue of licenses, the banking sector in Turkey is
quite fragmented with a large number of small or pocket banks without the requisite size, capital,
range and diversification of products and services, and the depth of technical and managerial
skills necessary to develop a healthy, strong and modern banking sector. In order therefore to
strengthen the capital structure, and to reverse the fragmentation of resources of the banking
sector, it is necessary to encourage mergers and consolidation. At the same time, to facilitate
efficient financial flows among several financial entities within a single business group, and to
better manage and supervise the inherent risks on a consolidated basis for the group financial
institutions (which is essentially required because of the public trust role of such institutions), it
is necessary to separate the financial and industrial activities of the financial-industrial groups in
Turkey into separate financial and industrial holdings. However, at this time any such merger,
consolidation or separation activity faces several tax (VAT, Banking and Insurance Transaction
tax, etc.) and corporate law disincentives. During 2001-02, the Government plans to review and
amend corporate and tax legislation as necessary to encourage mergers and consolidation in the
financial sector, and to facilitate transformation of financial-industrial groups into separate
financial and corporate conglomerates.
40.   Prudential Regulations for Non Banking Financial Institutions. In view of the size
and scale of the banking sector and the urgency under the present crisis circumstances, the
prudential reforms required for commercial banking activity have quite naturally received the
greater priority, during the years 2000-01. However during 2002, the Govermment plans to also
undertake a comprehensive review (with the assistance of the World Bank) of the prudential
regulations' regime for the non-banking financial institutions, to reduce their vulnerability to
potential macroeconomic volatility and to facilitate a more accelerated growth of non banking
financial activity in Turkey including equity and fixed income securities markets, insurance,
mutual funds and pension funds. Some of the focus areas identified as priority for reform are
listed below:
*  Completion of a review of the need for new/tighter FX and large/connected exposure limits
for the insurance industry and other non-bank financial institutions, and the introduction of
appropriate new limits as indicated by such review;
*  Adoption by Parliament of a new insurance law in line with applicable EU Directives;
*  Adoption by Parliament of amendments to applicable legislation to equalize absolute
minimum capital requirements for private pension funds and life insurance companies
involved in pension funds;
* Strengthening the regulatory and governance structure of all insurance companies' and other
financial institutions' employee pension funds;



- 22 -
* Completion of a review of all other prudential rules applicable to NBFI activity (insurance,
leasing, finance, factoring, pension funds, mutual funds, asset management) and adoption of
a formal plan to overhaul these rules as necessary to bring them in line with applicable
IAIS/IOSCO and other international standards; and
*  Completion of full introduction of IAS for banks and non bank financial institutions,
including IAS 29 with an appropriate phase-in period and IAS 39; activation of the new
Accounting Standards Board mandated by the Capital Markets Law; revision of Istanbul
Stock Exchange listing and disclosure rules for all financial institutions; overhaul of the
licensing regime for auditors of banks and other financial institutions;
* Initiation of a review of the overall tax regime for financial transactions and activity, and
identification of all tax structures that favor or discriminate against certain types of financial
sector activity; and preparation of amendments to tax legislation with a view to eliminate any
biases in favor or against certain types of financial sector activity.
D.   Strengthening the Institutional Capacity of the BRSA and the SDIF
41.   Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA). The BRSA since its creation on
September 1, 2000 has made progress towards its operationalization, but the November 2000 and
February 2001 banking sector crises have diverted attention and energy away from its own
institutional development agenda, which is far from finished. Therefore, the BRSA needs further
improvements in the following areas:
3 consolidate staff structure; BRSA staff came from five different departments within the
Undersecretariat of Treasury, the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank and, while these
staff now work within a single organization, they continue to operate on a semi-independent
basis and are still being paid using their previous employers' pay scales, diminishing the
potential benefits of creating a single regulatory authority for the banking sector;
D development of a common database; the maintenance by each function within the BRSA
(e.g., offsite monitoring, on-site monitoring, enforcement, licensing) of separate databases
and the use of different analytical models to assess the condition of individual banks,
resulting in sometimes conflicting analyses and policy recommendations being made by the
different departments to senior BRSA management;
* upgrade detailed procedures manuals for each BRSA function; while BRSA staff claim
they are all fully aware of their task responsibilities and the procedures to be followed in case
of regulatory/supervisory and enforcement action to be undertaken, these procedures are
currently not documented or the manuals that do exist are out of date;
* integrate offsite monitoring, onsite monitoring and enforcement activity; when onsite
examiners (called Swom Bank Auditors) go onsite in a bank, offsite and enforcement staff
are not allowed to participate in these site visits; additionally, the findings of the onsite
examiners are not fed back to the offsite department for correcting the offsite information on
the banks concerned;
* establish a specific problem bank unit within the enforcement function; following the
November 2000 and February 2001 crises, a further three banks were taken over by the SDIF
and a large number of other banks were severely weakened and are not currently able to
comply with all the BRSA's regulatory requirements; it is the responsibility of the BRSA's
enforcement division to work with any bank which is in violation of the banking regulations;



- 23 -
however, the capacity of the enforcement division is severely strained due to the large
number of banks which are currently not in compliance; furthernore, many of the banks are
not merely out of compliance but face the possibility of failure and hence require more
'hands on' attention and possibly the application of different skills to those available in the
enforcement division; the enforcement department has already assigned specific teams to
deal with capital deficient banks within the enforcement department, but they have to be
strengthened with staff and procedures and specific guidelines to deal with such problem
banks;
*  introduce an early warning system that could guide the efforts of the onsite examiners and
provide input in determining the onsite examination cycle; and
*  develop the concept of risk-based supervision, to shift the onsite examiners from being
mostly focused on compliance testing to identifying banking risks and assessing the quality
of the risk management undertaken by bank managers.
42.   To start addressing these weaknesses, the BRSA management will develop, and the
BRSA Board will adopt in June, a time-bound strategic plan with clearly assigned
implementation responsibilities for reaching the following objectives:  (i) having a
comprehensive human resource policy further assimilating its staff from different sources and
strengthening the staff training program; (ii) integrating the existing multiple databases into a
common database and a common platform for analyzing and assessing banking risks; (iii)
upgrading/developing procedures manuals for all major existing BRSA units; and (iv)
introducing the concept of relationship supervision with offsite examiners, enforcement staff and
Sworn Bank Auditors working in teams on individual banks. As part of a revised human resource
policy, the BRSA/Government will review the salaries of BRSA Board members and staff and
will bring them in line with the prevailing salary scales for similar professional staff in the
banking sector, in any event not less than the comparable salaries at the CBT or CMB. In
addition, as benchmarks for the planned PFPSAL 11 (a) the BRSA has agreed to set up problem
bank unit within the BRSA's enforcement department and to adopt a pre-failure corrective action
manual for the new unit, which will define pre-failure intervention triggers (effectively defining
a 'problem bank') and pre-failure corrective action procedures to be administered by the new
unit, and (b) the Government/BRSA have agreed to review the salaries of BRSA Board members
and staff and to bring them in line with the prevailing salary scales for similar professional staff
in the banking sector, in any event not less than the comparable salaries at the CBT or CMB.
The Bank will also look for satisfactory implementation of the time-bound strategic plan for the
BRSA as a policy benchmark for the planned PFPSAL II. Additional institutional development
efforts by the BRSA will be undertaken in the context of the planned PFSAL I and II during
2002. These additional actions include the development and operationalization of an early
warning system for monitoring of banks, and the introduction of a risk-based approach to
supervision.
43.   Savings Deposit Insurance Fund (SDIF). When the BRSA was created the SDIF, the
entity responsible for administering the deposit insurance scheme and resolving failed banks,
was transferred from the CBT where it was housed before the December 1999 banking law
became effective, to the new BRSA. The SDIF was already dealing with a sizeable pipeline of
failed banks before this transfer, and the case load of the agency has only increased since then.
Additionally, immediately after the November 2000 banking crisis, the SDIF was also given the



- 24 -
responsibility by the Government to administer the blanket guarantee covering all bank
depositors and creditors (except subordinated debt holders; shareholders are also not covered by
the guarantee). Thus, a targeted institutional development effort is also needed at the SDIF to
ensure it can effectively perform the function of bank failure resolution entity and administrator
of the blanket guarantee and the deposit insurance scheme. To meet this need, and as a
benchmark for the planned PFPSAL II, SDIF management has agreed to prepare, and the SDIF
Board has agreed to approve a time-bound strategic plan, with clearly assigned implementation
responsibilities, that will achieve the following objectives: (i) putting in place a more effective
organizational structure, with clearly separated line responsibilities for bank resolution efforts,
asset management efforts, administration of the blanket guarantee & the deposit insurance
scheme and supporting functions such as legal, human resources and infornation technology; (ii)
setting perforrnance targets for the bank resolution and asset management functions; (iii) hiring
additional qualified staff to handle the high volume of non-performing loans and other problem
assets to be transferred to the Collections Department for collection/workout; and (iv) building a
centralized and high quality management information system that will allow SDIF senior
management and the SDIF Board to monitor progress being made towards reaching agreed
resolution and asset management/collection targets. The Bank will be looking for satisfactory
implementation of this time-bound strategic plan as a reforrm action under the PFSAL I.
44.   Deposit Insurance Reform. The institutional development of SDIF can not be
successfully completed till the policy on its long term mandate is clearly articulated. In this
context, during 2002, the Government plans to remove the blanket guarantee to all commercial
bank depositors and creditors presently in force under crisis conditions, and replace it with a
deposit insurance regime consistent with the EU standards on Deposit Insurance, including the
use of risk based premiums. At the same during 2002, the effective functioning of the SDIF's
present legal, governance, financing and management structure as a subsidiary of the BRSA will
be reviewed, and the feasibility of the SDIF existing as a separate autonomous and institution
will be considered as necessary. These further reform measures for the SDIF are envisaged
under the planned PFSAL I and II during 2002/early 2003.
45.   Creation of Consolidated Regulatory Infrastructure. While the above outlined reform
efforts are expected to contribute to the emergence of the BRSA as a more effective bank
regulatory agency, the current financial sector regulatory infrastructure in Turkey remains
fragmented, while the banks, through majority ownership of numerous financial subsidiaries, de
facto operate as universal banks across all fields of financial sector activity (i.e., in areas such as
insurance, portfolio management, securities trading and underwriting, mutual and pension fund
management the banks' subsidiaries are the key players). There are currently separate regulatory
agencies for insurance (the General Directorate of Insurance in the Undersecretariat of Treasury),
leasing, finance & factoring (the General Directorate of Non-Bank Financial Institutions in the
Undersecretariat of Treasury), portfolio management, securities trading and underwriting and
mutual funds (the Capital Markets Board) and private pension funds (a new Private Pension
Fund Regulator operating under a Coordinating Committee comprising the Ministry of Labor,
the General Directorate of Insurance and the Capital Markets Board). Such an atomized
regulatory infrastructure, coupled with a potential lack of smooth inter-agency cooperation, adds
to the risks of an already fragile financial sector. Therefore, the Government intends to further
deepen the consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates during 2002 and early 2003 in
the context of the planned PFSAL I and II by: (i) extending the coverage of the BRSA's



- 25 -
consolidated reporting requirement for banks to horizontal conglomerates; and (ii) further
amendments to prudential regulations for banks and NBFI/capital markets activity as necessary
to introduce a consolidated regulatory infrastructure. In addition, during 2002 the Government
will evaluate the feasibility of the creation of an integrated financial sector regulatory
infrastructure umbrella (if necessary through merger/coordination of the BRSA with the Capital
Markets Board and the Treasury's Insurance and NBFI Directorates) for comprehensive
regulation and supervision of banking, non-bank financial institutions & capital markets activity.
E.    Implementation of Efficient Problem Bank/Bank Failure Resolution
46.   Private Banks (Monitoring and Addressing Current and Future Capital Adequacy).
Due to the November 2000 and February 2001 crises, the capital base of nearly all of the private,
domestically owned deposit taking banks (28 banks in total as of end May, 2001 excluding SDIF
banks) has been weakened substantially. Stress testing has confirmed that as a result of the
combined impact of interest rate, exchange rate and credit risk shocks, many of the banks
concerned either already have suffered, or are likely to suffer, from capital inadequacy in the
near future. These capital deficits among such private banks range from temporary non-
compliance with the 8 percent minimum capital adequacy ratio requirement, to permanent
insolvency and inability of some of the banks concerned to survive on their own. In order to
remedy this potentially systemic capital shortfall, during the period March-May, 2001 the BRSA
has undertaken the following actions:
*  The BRSA has, in the aftermath of the February crisis, instructed all private commercial
banks except well-capitalized banks not to pay dividends and to retain all year 2000 earnings;
*  Through a combination of offsite analysis and on-site examinations, the BRSA has identified
all capital deficient banks, and the likely size of the already apparent, or soon to be apparent
capital shortfall in each bank concerned;
* The BRSA has held in-depth discussions with each bank concerned on the need to prepare
time-bound capital restoration plans, including in some instances the need for the merger of
multiple weaker banks that belong to the same financial-industrial group into one larger,
stronger bank; and
*  The BRSA has also publicly announced that it is seeking credible capital restoration plans on
a system-wide basis.
By end June 2001, the BRSA will enter into capital restoration plans with all banks concerned.
47.   The BRSA's existing Enforcement Department is responsible for monitoring the timely
implementation of these capital restoration plans. Those banks that will not be able to
satisfactorily implement their capital restoration plan will be intervened by the SDIF and
resolved. To assist the Department's staff in doing so, and to strengthen the ability of the
BRSA's Offsite Monitoring Department to timely detect new problem bank cases on an ongoing
basis, the BRSA as part of its overall institutional development effort, will create a sophisticated
early warning system. Based on earlier indications, a significant number of banks will be able to
recapitalize themselves from internal sources or through mergers or acquisition by domestic or
foreign banks. The fiscal costs for undertaking the intervention and resolution of any remaining
insolvent banks by the SDIF are therefore expected to be relatively less compared to the total re-



- 26 -
capitalization outlays required for all the remaining private banks in the sector, and based on
current estimates is unlikely to impose a major additional fiscal burden.
48.    Complementing the BRSA's efforts in this respect, the CBT has also put in place a new
mechanism allowing it to monitor deposit interest rate movements for different maturities and
currencies of all banks on a weekly basis. In this manner, the CBT will be able to identify very
early on any undue liquidity pressures that may arise in individual banks, signaling possible new
capital shortfalls. The already agreed Memorandum of Understanding between the CBT, the
BRSA and the Treasury allows for the full and confidential exchange of information relevant to
the early detection of new 'problem' bank cases between the three agencies, providing an
additional safeguard against the risk of renewed and unexpected systemic crisis. Additionally,
the Government has identified obstacles in tax legislation to bank mergers, and has submitted
amendments to Parliament to remove these obstacles. Parliament is expected to enact these
amendments by end-June.
49.    Resolution of Failed SDIF Banks. The reform  effort to accelerate the resolution of
failed banks by the SDIF was initiated in December 1999 with the passage of the new banking
law that provided the SDIF with an extended range of resolution options9. However, the
resolution effort remained on the back burner and got under way in earnest only after September
2000 for several reasons: (i) absence of clear financing arrangements between the SDIF and the
Treasury for the cash and Government securities needed for expeditious bank failure resolution
efforts; (ii) inertia and uncertainty at the Treasury (previously responsible for bank supervision)
and the SDIF, managed by the CBT, in anticipation of their transfer to the new BRSA, which
was created and became operational only on September 1, 2000; and (iii) lack of a coordinated
policy for the provision of lender of last resort financing by the CBT in a manner consistent with
the Net Domestic Asset ceiling under the IMF Stand-by Agreement; fear of unavailability of
such financing probably has contributed to regulatory forbearance.
50.    Post September 2000, the SDIF stepped-up efforts to sell banks under its control as going
concerns but, due in part to the two banking crises that occurred in November 2000 and February
2001, these efforts were not successful. To date, the SDIF has not yet sold any bank, and the
post crises environment is not very conducive to sales. Therefore, more recently the SDIF has
initiated a strategy of merging some of the banks under its control into a transition bank and
revoking the licenses of the banks so merged. This strategy, while much slower than the
9 The available failure resolution techniques include:
Deposit Transfer. When good assets are sufficient to cover insured depositors. Insured deposits and good assets are
simply transferred to another bank, and the remaining shell is liquidated by the SDIF.
Purchase and Assumption. When good assets are not sufficient to cover insured depositors or protected liabilities.
Bonds and/or cash are used to carve out bad assets to balance good assets and protected liabilities. The good assets
(along with bonds and/or cash) are purchased by another bank that also assumes the liabilities. Ideally, the
"purchase and assumption" transactions would occur over a weekend or a very short span of time. However, if a
buyer cannot be found, the good assets and protected liabilities are moved into a newly licensed bank (a "bridge"
bank) until a buyer can be found. Importantly, the split of assets (i.e., "good" and "bad" banks) will occur
immediately whether or not a buyer is found.  The actions are taken secretly in order to avoid further
depletion/depreciation of assets by shareholders/borrowers. The remaining shell of the original bank with the bad
assets and remaining liabilities is liquidated by the SDIF.
Depositor Payoff. There are so few good assets that the simplest and quickest means of resolving the failure is for
the SDIF to pay insured depositors and liquidate the failed bank's assets.



- 27 -
expeditious resolution efforts envisaged under the December 1999 banking law, has so far
resulted in the 'exit' of 5 banks (see Box 1 below). The branches of these banks are being closed
and their staff is being laid off over a 5-6 months period. Thus, a slower process of consolidation
is being implemented in the short term, while a medium term decision on sale/merger/closure is
being evaluated.
51.    Keeping the SDIF intervened banks open for a long period with inadequate liquidity and
solvency support, rather than using expeditious 'least cost' resolution efforts such as those
envisaged by the December 1999 banking law (including Igaying off depositors and closing the
non-viable banks) has continued to cause major losses to these banks; and has therefore
ultimately proved to be much more costly to the Government. In fact, the slow pace of
resolution of SDIF banks has in itself been a major contributing factor to the November 2000 and
February 2001 banking crises, as the SDIF banks' unaddressed large capital and liquidity
shortages have forced them to continuously borrow in the interbank market at very high interest
rates. These high rates, also fuelled by unresolved problems at the large state-owned banks
Ziraat and Halk (see paragraph 58-59 below), in turn have eroded the profit margins of other
private banks, thereby contributing to a further weakening of the banking system's capital base.
10 Cumulative restructuring outlays for SDIF banks are estimated to be TL 19.8 quadrillion (US$17.2 billion at post-
crisis exchange rates) as of May 15, 2001 (this number includes TL 3.46 quadrillion replacement of earlier issued
low-interest rate securities to allow the SDIF banks to cover their funding costs). The TL 3.84 quadrillion (US$5.6
billion at pre-crisis exchange rates) injection of Govermnent securities in December 2000 intended to recapitalize
the SDIF banks up to 8 percent was nearly completely wiped out as a result of the late November/early December
2000 interest rate spike alone. The SDIF banks' large FX open positions also have proven to be a very costly
proposition in the face of the February 2001 exchange rate devaluation. Earlier estimates of the cost of resolution of
SDIF banks (based on a caseload of 8 banks as of end December 1999) using least cost resolution methods were in
the range of US$5-6 billion only.

Box 1: SDIF BANKS
During the period 1997-early 1999 only 3 banks were intervened by the SDIF. In September 1999, recognizing that
problems were mounting in the banking sector, the Government approached the Bank for assistance with a planned
SDIF intervention in an additional 5 banks. An intensive dialogue between the Govermnent and the Bank resulted
in the enactment of a new banking law in December 1999 with strong resolution powers for the SDIF. Immediately
upon the passage of the new law, the SDIF intervened in the aforementioned 5 banks. This rapid phase of initial
action was followed by a 9 month period of relative inaction, as the CBT and the Undersecretariat of Treasury were
waiting for the formation of the new BRSA. Unresolved questions about how the SDIF was to finance the injection
of cash and Government securities required for resolution of the banks under its control also contributed to the
inaction.

Source: BRSA and SDIF.
With the operationalization of the BRSA on September 1, 2000 the pace of resolution picked up. In October 2000,
an additional 2 banks were intervened. In November 2000, the SDIF signed a protocol with the Undersecretariat of
Treasury that allowed it to increase, during December 2000, the share capital of the banks under its control through
the injection of US$ 5.6 billion of Government securities (TL 3.86 quadrillion). Immediately afterwards the SDIF
announced the sale of the banks. Though there was some initial interest from both domestic and international
groups, no banks were sold.
The November 2000 banking crisis was triggered by the excessive liquidity demands of Demir, which needed funds
to support a highly speculative position in Government securities. Unable to meet its liabilities as they fell due,
Demir was taken over by the SDIF. To prevent a system-wide deposit run, the Government issued a blanket
guarantee, to be administered by the SDIF and exercisable upon SDIF intervention, covering all banking system
liabilities (except subordinated debt). Following the February 2001 banking/economic crisis the SDIF intervened in
an additional 2 banks, bringing the total number of intervened banks to 13, and the number of banks that have failed
during the past 18 months to 10. The principal features of most of these bank failures have been acute shortages of
liquidity and a high incidence of fraudulent/crirninal activity on the part of shareholders and management.
Unable to dispose of the banks as going concerns, the SDIF has recently revoked the licenses of 5 banks and merged
them into a transition bank (Sumer). As a result, the number of SDIF banks was reduced from 13 to 8. After
financial and operational restructuring Sumer bank has been offered for sale in early June. If the bank cannot be
sold by year end 2001, its license will be revoked and its remaining assets will be sold off, its creditors will be paid
down and the remaining shell will be liquidated. A second transition bank will be formed by merging Inter, Es and
Eti into Turk Ticaret and the licenses of the banks concerned will be revoked by end-June 2001 if these banks
cannot be sold. In case any of these banks will not be merged into a transition bank, its license will be revoked and
liquidation initiated. Again, the merged entity will be restructured and offered for sale. If the bank cannot be sold
by end 2001, its license will be revoked, its assets sold off, its creditors paid and the remaining shell will be
liquidated.

52.   To address these urgent resolution priorities and to set this disappointing resolution
record straight, a set of comprehensive new problem bank and bank failure resolution measures
need to be undertaken. These must be implemented in a coordinated fashion by the BRSA and
the SDIF on the one hand, and the Treasury and the CBT on the other hand. As a first step, and
as a condition for the proposed PFPSAL, the following measures have already been taken:
* The Undersecretariat of Treasury in cooperation with the CBT has injected into the SDIF
banks enough (i) marketable Government securities (in TL and FX) in a mix of maturities
and currency denominations carrying quarterly market-based floating rate coupon interest to
ensure that the banks have sufficient liquidity to operate and honor any deposit withdrawals,
and to recapitalize them up to 0 percent capital adequacy; and (ii) cash (in lieu of the
Government securities above) to retire at least two thirds of all on and off balance sheet
overnight high cost liability funding of the SDIF banks outstanding as of March 16, 2001
(excluding liabilities to the CBT); the CBT has subsequently mopped up excess liquidity
through open market operations within an overall ceiling on the stock of repurchase
agreements of the SDIF and state-owned banks with the CBT as of end May of TL 7
quadrillion.
By the end of June 2001, the following further steps will be completed:
* The SDIF will: (i) hire additionally required staff for its Collection Department; (ii) receive
approval from its Board to allow the transfer of 1,166 problem loan files above TL 75 billion
of Sumer to the Collections Department; (iii) transfer 150 problem loan files above TL 75
billion from Sumer to the Collection Department. In addition, the SDIF regulation will be
amended before August 31, 2001 to reflect the recent amendment of the Banking Law and to
adopt the necessary organizational structure and detailed operating procedures for the
Collection Department; and
* The SDIF Board will select a second 'transition bank' to avoid overload at Sumer, and will
revoke the licenses and initiated the merger of Turk Ticaret, Ekspres, Es, Inter and Eti with
either one of the transition banks in the absence of successful sales; even in case any of these
banks will not be merged into a transition bank, its license will be revoked and liquidation
initiated.
53.   Additional measures are foreseen as benchmarks for the planned PFPSAL  11.
Specifically, the SDIF has agreed to undertake the following additional steps:
*  To sell Ekspres, Demir and Iktisat, or revoke their licenses and merge them with the
transition bank(s);
*  To  resolve  Sumer and  the  second   transition  bank  through  sale  or license
revocation/liquidation; and
* To complete the transfer of all problem loan files above TL 75 billion to the Collection
Department and the Collection Department to either reach negotiated settlement with the loan
defaults or initiate legal action for all problem loan files;



- 30 -
* The SDIF to amend its regulations to reflect the recent amendments in the banking law, and
to adopt the necessary organizational structure and operating procedures for the Collection
Departnent by August 31, 2001.
These measures will result in the complete resolution of the existing pipeline of 8 SDIF banks by
year end 2001.
54.    Bankruptcy, Foreclosure and Collateral Legislation and Infrastructure Reform. The
banking crisis and its aftermath in the corporate sector is likely to cause a significant amount of
downstream corporate restructuring/workout activity as a result of foreclosure and bankruptcy
procedures by banks. Though some work has been initiated in this area by the Bank's financial
sector team, a coordinated review by the Government of the improvements required in the legal
framework for debt restructuring and workout will be undertaken and refonn recommendations
developed as part of the PFPSAL II, and the PFSALs I & II. These will also include a review of
the need to set up a movable goods collateral register.
F.     Implementation of Comprehensive Restructuring and Privatization of State-owned
Banks
55.    Overview. Over a third of banking system assets and deposits are accounted for by four
large state-owned banks, Ziraat, Halk, Emlak and Vakif (Table 6 below). Ziraat has traditionally
focused on agricultural finance'" and Halk on lending to small businesses and artisans. Emlak
has been engaged in such disparate activities such as public housing construction, trade finance
and shipbuilding as a result of a previous Government policy of merging failed banks operating
in different economic sectors, and as such has no clear mandate. Vakif is a retail and general
corporate sector focused bank, and has an ownership structure dating from Ottoman times, with
A and B shares (55 and 20 percent of capital respectively) historically belonging to so-called
'vakifs' (foundations) and now represented by the Ministry of State's General Directorate of
Foundations, and the remaining C shares (25 percent of total) belonging to the bank's pension
fund and employees.

Ziraat actually combines three separate activities into one entity: (i) agricultural finance; (ii) general commercial
banking; and (iii) payrnent and collection services for the Government. Because of the latter, and as the bank is the
only bank serving small rural communities, its restructuring and privatization will be more complex than that of the
other three state banks. In preparation for its eventual privatization, Ziraat prepared its first set of IAS financial
statements for the year ended December 1999.

56.   Halk, Ziraat and Emlak. Longstanding Government governance and ownership has
steadily eroded the financial condition of Ziraat, Halk and Emlak. For Ziraat and Halk, enormous
losses have been hidden under the umbrella of illiquid Government "duty losses" (paper claims
on the Government carried on the banks' books) for the last five years as a by-product of
subsidized, directed lending for agriculture and small business development. Emlak has
accumulated significant losses through its construction related activities and non-performing
loans, and the bank was already insolvent even before the November 2000 crisis.
57.   The total duty losses in the books of Ziraat and Halk for the period 1995 - April 2001 are
presented in Table 7 below. The losses increased from US$2.8 billion at the end of 1995 to
US$22.6 billion at the end of 2000 (at pre-crisis exchange rates). During the first four months of
2001, due to the enormous losses incurred by these banks as a result of the crisis and despite
large injections of Government securities in lieu of part of the outstanding stock (see paragraph
59 below), in TL terms the duty losses further increased by more than 50 percent, even though in
US$ terms the total amount declined due to the February devaluation of the TL. The distortion in
the money markets caused by the large liquidity shortfalls experienced by the two banks as a
result of the rapid build-up of the duty loss claims was one of the principal propagators of the
November 2000 and February 2001 banking crises.
58.   During the November 2000 and February 2001 crises, both Ziraat and Halk suffered a
rapid and dramatic transformation of the maturity structure of their liabilities (much more so in
Halk), resulting in a sharp increase in their liability funding costs. Additionally, as both banks
were already heavily dependent on overnight interbank and central bank funding, on this portion
of their funding the costs also shot up immediately. To compensate for these funding losses,
Ziraat and Halk continued to accrue duty loss receivables. During the first quarter of 2001, the
Treasury gave the banks12 a total of TL 7.8 quadrillion (nearly US$6.8 billion at today's
exchange rates) worth of Government bonds, in a combination of a marketable and non-
marketable securities, primarily to use as collateral to raise funding on the repo market. Due to
the large incremental losses run up by these two banks during and in the aftermath of the
November 2000 and February 2001 crises, however, the outstanding stock of duty losses
continued to increase (in TL terms; as noted above, in US$ terms the amount actually declined
slightly due to the TL devaluation that occurred in February).
59.   As neither Ziraat nor Halk ran large open foreign currency positions, the devaluation of
the Lira during the February crisis had little direct impact on these two banks. At the same time,
it is expected that the secular increase in borrowing costs for the banks' customers will be
reflected in a decrease in the quality of the banks' loan portfolios and an increase in the amount
of funds to be set aside to account for non-perforning loans.

60.    Pre-crises, the  Government had  already  initiated  the  financial  and  ownership
restructuring of the state banks. In November 2000, Parliament enacted an amendment to the
law on Vakif allowing the sequential sale of the B shares and A shares held by the Ministry of
State's General Directorate of Foundations. In August of that same year, Vakif engaged an
investment banks for the sale of B shares through an initial public offering. The Government
also initiated the commercialization and financial restructuring of Emlak during late 1999 and
early 2000 by removing the stock of housing from its books. In December 2000, at the initiative
of the Undersecretariat of Treasury, new legislation was submitted to, and enacted by Parliament
that: (i) allowed Ziraat, Halk and Emlak to be completely privatized; (ii) selectively removed the
application of state economic enterprise legislation (Decree Law No. 233 and related laws) to the
banks in preparation for their privatization; and (iii) allowed the Government to undertake any
restructuring actions necessary to prepare these banks for privatization. Restructuring Boards
had been created for the banks and management had begun to formulate operational restructuring
plans. The Government had envisaged a 2-3 year timeframe for the privatization of Halk and up
to 4 !/2 years for Ziraat. However, the destabilizing effect of the state banks on the whole
banking system has made it clear that the process of state bank restructuring and privatization
must be significantly accelerated to restore banking system stability and confidence.
61.    Financial and Governance Restructuring. The objective of restructuring the three state
banks Ziraat, Halk and Emlak is: (i) to reduce the excessive liquidity pressure on the banking
system caused by the overnight refinancing needs of Ziraat and Halk; and (ii) to ensure that these
banks are effectively and professionally managed on an arms length basis and transformed into
profitable commercial banks that can be rapidly privatized. To achieve these objectives, as
conditions for the proposed PFPSAL the Government, in cooperation with the CBT and the
BRSA, has undertaken the following actions:
* Injection into Ziraat and Halk of enough (i) marketable Government securities at market
terms in a mix of maturities and currency denominations with floating coupon interest paid
quarterly to ensure that the banks have sufficient liquidity to operate and honor any deposit
withdrawals, allow the write-off of all duty loss claims as of mid May 2001 and the



- 33 -
recapitalization of the two banks to 8 percent capital adequacy 3; in addition, non-standard
below market interest rate Government securities in the books of these two banks issued
earlier in lieu of duty loss claims have been reissued in uniformity with the new set of
securities 14; and (ii) cash (in lieu of the Government securities above) to allow the banks to
retire at least two thirds of their on and off balance sheet overnight high cost liability funding
outstanding as of March 16, 2001, with the CBT subsequently mopping up excess liquidity
through open market operations within an overall maximum ceiling of TL 7 quadrillion as of
end May, 2001 on the stock of repurchase agreements of the state-owned and SDIF banks
with the CBT (see also Box 2 below); and
* Appointment of a new independent professional Governing Board for the two banks with the
mandate to manage these banks in accordance with commercial principles and all prudential
guidelines under the banking law/issued by the BRSA; the Governing Board has initiated the
operational restructuring of the two banks, including the closure of unprofitable branches and
the reduction of redundant staff.
By the end of June 2001, the following additional action will be taken:
* Appointment by the Governing Board of a Restructuring Adviser for Ziraat and a
Restructuring and Privatization Adviser for Halk.
Given the Government's view that legislation is needed to authorize the close of Emlak Bank,
the following further actions will be completed by July 15, 2001:
- The transfer of construction related assets on the books of Emlak to the Mass Housing
Administration, the completion of the merger of all banking liabilities and all the performing
banking assets of Emlak with Ziraat and Halk, the revocation of Emlak's banking license;
the provision of sufficient capital to Ziraat and Halk in the form of marketable Government
securities carrying quarterly floating rate coupon interest to allow them to absorb all losses
related to Emlak's merger, including the issuance of Mass Housing Fund securities to Emlak
in lieu of the construction related assets transferred to the MHA on a short-term basis to be
exchanged with Treasury securities within 2001.
62.   Operational Restructuring. Soon after the financial and governance restructuring is
implemented by mid 2001, the Government intends to initiate the operational restructuring of
Halk and Ziraat. Under the oversight of the new independent Governing Board, Ziraat is
expected to make substantial progress towards the closure of unprofitable branches and will also
be able to reduce a large part of its excess staff through early retirement packages and alternative
placements. In the latter area, the Governing Board expects to achieve substantial progress in
13 During April and the first two weeks of May, 2001 the Government issued an additional TL 9.23 quadrillion in
securities to Ziraat, and TL 5.88 quadrillion to Halk, bringing the total injection of securities (including securities
issued during the first quarter of 20010 during 2001 to TL13.33 quadrillion for Ziraat and TL 13.07 quadrillion for
Halk.
14 The re-issuance occurred on May 14, 2001 in an amount of TL 5.62 quadrillion for Ziraat and TL 6.99 quadrillion
for Halk.



-34 -
this area by end 2001, and plans to complete the process of unprofitable branch closures and
excess staff relocation or early retirement during 2002.
63.    In case of Ziraat specifically, the new Governing Board will undertake a review of its
products, services and operating structure to be able to develop a strategic model for delivering
agricultural services on a commercial basis. For this purpose, a review of similar successful
models in other parts of the world including Europe will be carried out, and technical assistance
sought as necessary. Additionally, all public service functions of Ziraat will be identified, all the
options to determine how such services can be provided on a cost neutral or profitable basis in
future will be reviewed (whether by Ziraat or transferred to other entities, or even offered
through other banks, or a network of the postal service being several of the potential options),
and a transfer plan based on the most suitable option will be adopted through issuance of
necessary decrees/legislation. This is expected to be achieved during 2002.
Box 2: Costs of State Bank Restructuring
The financial restructuring of the three state-owned banks Ziraat, Halk and Emlak is based on a three step process. The first step
entails retiring all of the high cost ovemight liabilities of the banks (both on and off balance sheet) and replacing them with
liabilities to the Central Bank of Turkey (CBT). The second step entails the recapitalization of the banks to 8 percent capital
adequacy with marketable Government securities carrying quarterly floating rate coupon interest. This step includes the
replacement of earlier issued non-marketable paper with marketable paper carrying quarterly floating rate coupon interest. The
final step entails the purchase of these securities from the banks by the CBT, and the use of the cash so received to retire the
banks' liabilities to the CBT. The restructuring has been carried out gradually over a 2-3 months period, so as to allow any
monetary leakage to be absorbed through accompanying open market operations. The total cost of restructuring the three banks,
based on a cut-off as of mid May 2001 of the duty loss connection with the Treasury is given below.

64.    Privatization of Halk and Ziraat.  With the financial and governance restructuring
completed by June 2001, and operational restructuring underway in the coming months, the
structural reform in this area will be sustained by shifting the focus to ownership change through
effective privatization of Halk and Ziraat. In this area, the Government: (i) will appoint a
Restructuring and Privatization Adviser for Halk in June, and intends to complete the full
resolution of Halk, resulting in either 100 percent private ownership of the bank or merger with
an acquisition of Halk by another bank in 2002; and (ii) will appoint a Restructuring Adviser for
Ziraat, and intends to carry out the sale of shares in Ziraat to private sector entities resulting in
majority private ownership and control (more than 51 percent) by late 2002/early 2003.
65.    Vakif Privatization. Furthermore, the Government has submitted, and Parliament is
expected to adopt in June, an amendment to the legislation conceming the privatization of Vakif



-35 -
to allow the simultaneous sale of A and B shares. The Government also has agreed to authorize
the simultaneous sale of the A and B shares. By December 2001 the Government intends to
complete the privatization of all remaining Government ownership (75 percent) in Vakif,
resulting in this bank becoming fully privately owned and controlled.

III. TURKEY'S PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM
66.   The Government's public sector reform program aims to underpin sustained fiscal
adjustment and create the conditions for transparent and effective government. In combination
with the financial sector reform program described in Section II, the public sector reform
program addresses the underlying structural factors that led to the crisis, thereby trying to ensure
that these conditions do not recur in the future. In particular, the program aims to break the
vicious circle of inadequate public sector management leading to ever increasing public
indebtedness that fuels financial sector weakness through dependency on high return government
securities which in turn inflates the public debt burden. The reform aims to achieve pernanent
fiscal adjustment; as well as radical improvements in public policy formulation, the framework
for resource mobilization and allocation, the system of public oversight and accountability, and
public sector governance. This is an agenda for modernizing the Turkish state to meet the
challenges of the new century.
67.   The program  focuses on three critical areas, each of which has a medium-term
dimension:
* Implement structural fiscal policies to ensure permanent fiscal adjustment;
* Launch a medium-term program of policy and institutional reforms to improve the
transparency and efficiency of public expenditure management (PEM) including action to:
*  Improve budget preparation and execution, policy formulation, and the operational
performance of public agencies,
*  Upgrade public accounting, procurement and audit standards to ensure financial
accountability, and
*  Ensure prudent public liability management; and
* Initiate broad based institutional reforms to improve the quality of public sector governance.
68.   In each of the these areas, the Government has developed or is preparing a strategic
approach to guide its actions over the next three years.
*  In the area of structural fiscal policies, the approach will be based on (i) a medium-term
strategy for improving the tax system and (ii) a comprehensive program to adjust staffing
levels in the central government and SEEs, both of which are to be prepared and adopted
during the remainder of 2001.
* With regard to public expenditure management, the Government has prepared a three year
Strategic Framework for Public Expenditure Management Reform (Annex VII) which is
annexed to the Letter of Development Policy.
* In the area of public sector governance, the Government is preparing a national strategy for
improving governance and combating corruption which it intends to finalize by late
September and adopt and publish before the end of the year.
69.   Bank support for public sector reform in Turkey is designed to take into account the
complex requirements of the institutional changes that lie at the heart of this reform. The first
phase focused on sustaining the fiscal adjustment and setting into motion the key change
processes for institutional reform will be supported by the proposed PFPSAL and PFPSAL II.



- 37 -
The PFPSAL will support measures in the following four areas: (i) implementation of structural
fiscal polices to support the primary surplus targets for 2001 and beyond; (ii) initiation of the
PEM reform process including preparation of key legislation to underpin improvements in
financial accountability (procurement) and public liability management; and (iii) initiation of
work on a national strategy to improve governance and fight corruption. These reform measures
are described in more detail in the paragraphs below and in the policy matrix for the PFPSAL
(Annex VI). The planned PFPSAL II, for which the benchmarks for public sector reform are
given in the policy matrix, will focus on: (a) deepening structural fiscal policies paving the way
for permanent fiscal adjustment; (b) implementation of the first phase of the PEM reform on a
pilot basis in the 2002 budget and rationalization of the public investment program (PIP); (c)
enactment of legislation on public procurement and public debt management; and (d) adoption
and publication of the national anti-corruption strategy. Subsequent reform efforts, including
rollout of the PEM reform, steps to adjust staffing in the government and state economic
enterprises (SEEs), and deeper institutional changes in the areas of tax administration, financial
accountability and public sector governance--including civil service reform--will be supported by
the programmatic public sector adjustment loan (PPSAL) planned for late 2002 and possible
subsequent operations beyond the timeframe of the CAS.
A.    Structural Fiscal Policies
70.   The Government is implementing tough fiscal measures to support the revised budget for
2001. These measures supplement the original fiscal package for the 2001 budget approved in
December 2000. The original package included important revenue measures including extension
through 2002 of several temporary taxes, renewal of quarterly advance income tax payments,
increases in motor vehicle taxes, and the re-introduction of presumptive income taxation based
on living standards. The supplementary fiscal package includes significant additional revenue
measures, but the main emphasis is on expenditure cuts, a major policy shift for Turkey (Box 3).
The additional revenue measures including increases in the petroleum consumption tax, the VAT
rates, and the contribution base and ceiling for social security contributions, were implemented
in May as prior actions for the 6th and 7th Stand-by reviews. The supplementary budget for 2001
was approved by Parliament on June 15 as a condition for Board presentation of the PFPSAL
and completion of the 8th Stand-by review15.
71.   Looking past the immediate crisis, further effort will be needed to shift from temporary to
more permanent measures in order to sustain the fiscal adjustment over the medium term. The
2001 fiscal package continues to rely heavily on temporary and ad hoc measures notably taxes
introduced in the aftermath of the 1999 earthquakes, slowdowns in expenditure and across-the-
board expenditure cuts. Together with increases in the VAT (3 percentage points since late
1999) and in specific commodity taxes (e.g., gasoline, vehicles and cellular phones), this may be
sufficient to achieve the 5.5 percent of GNP primary surplus targeted for 2001. However, more
fundamental measures will be required to reach the 6.5 percent of GNP surplus targeted for 2002
15 Further fiscal measures are being taken in the context of the 81h Stand-by review to compensate for the higher than
expected increases in public sector wages and cereal support prices. These measures include: (i) additional increases
in the PCT in May and June, (ii) additional increases in electricity and gas prices, (iii) increases in cigarette prices
by the state tobacco company, and (iv) increase in the margin between the purchase and sales prices of the state
grain company.



- 38 -
and to sustain this adjustment over the medium term. These structural fiscal measures will
complete and build on the results achieved under the ERL program particularly in the areas of
social security reform, energy reform, and reform of agriculture support policies.
Box 3: Fiscal Measures for 2001
*  Increase petroleum consumption tax by 20 percent in April and 15 percent in May; thereafter tax will be
increased at a rate at least equal to WPI inflation;
*  Increase standard and luxury VAT rates by one percentage point;
*  Increase, as of April, the minimum base for social security contributions by 40 percent and increase the ceiling
on contributions from 4 to 5 times the niinimum base;
*  Maintain civil service salaries constant in real tenrns according to the current indexation system and freeze the
total number of civil servants in 2001;
*  Negotiate two year contracts with public workers which are in line with disinflation objectives;
*  Adjust current expenditure, transfers and investment by less than the inflation rate in order to save 1.5
percentage points of GNP;
*  Cut "other current expenditure", including defense outlays, covered by article 53 of the budget law to save 0.3
percent of GNP;
*  Include costs of temporary credit subsidies in 2001 (0.2 percent of GNP) in the budget to avoid duty losses;
*  Improve prinmary position of the state enterprise sector by 1.5 percent of GNP compared to 2000 level based on
the following measures: (i) increase SEEs' tariffs and prices in line with their increased costs; (ii) reduce SEEs'
operating expenses in real terms; (iii) cut sugar beet quotas from 12 V2 to 11 Y2 million tons; (iv) limit the volume
of support purchases of cereals and offload additional grain stocks; (v) keep agriculture support price increases
in 2001 to at most targeted inflation; (vi) maintain the average price of electricity sold by TEAS at US$4.5
cents/kwh; (vii) discontinue LPG subsidies; and (viii) eliminate all discounts and exemptions on SEE products
and services. In addition, the Government will continue to implement the policy of replacing up to a maximum
of 15 percent of retiring personnel in the SEEs;
*  Slow down spending by extra-budgetary funds to save 0.25 percent of GNP relative to 2000; and
*  Implement measures approved in original 2001 budget as planned.
72.    The Government is preparing a medium-term  strategy for improving the tax system in
Turkey based on a review to be carried out jointly with the World Bank. Building on the 1998
tax reform, the strategy will cover: tax administration, personal income tax, corporate income tax
and the indirect tax system. The overall objective is to improve the stability, transparency and
equity of the tax system. Given that the tax burden in Turkey is already in line with OECD
averages, there is limited scope for increasing revenues in aggregate, but there is a pressing need
to stabilize tax revenues by broadening the tax base and to improve equity by reducing the heavy
reliance on commodity taxes and the VAT. Improving tax administration is a priority including
automation, transparency, compliance, taxpayer services and tax audit. In an important up-front
action, the Government will enact in June 2001 a tax regulation expanding the use of Tax
Identification Numbers (TINs) to owners of bank accounts, users of banking services and
participants in financial transactions. As part of the medium-term strategy, the MOF is preparing
provisions to facilitate mergers and acquisitions in the corporate sector as the economy recovers
from the crisis, as well as a special consumption tax to replace the existing system of specific
excise taxes. Most of these initiatives involve complex institutional and policy changes which
will take time to carry out and it is important that the changes be carefully prepared and
sequenced. Adoption of the medium-term strategy will be a benchmark for PFPSAL II and its
implementation will be supported by the subsequent PPSAL.



- 39 -
73.   Deeper structural measures will be needed on the expenditure side as well. Credible
actions will be required to adjust staffing levels throughout the central government and SEEs to a
level consistent with medium-term resource constraints and the announced fiscal targets. The
Government has decided that the total number of civil servants will not increase in 2001,
although replacement hinrng is allowed and recruitment will continue to meet needs in the social
sectors, notably education. The Government also implementing strictly the existing policy of
replacing up to a maximum of 15 percent of retiring personnel in the SEEs including Turk
Telekom and the enterprises in the portfolio of the Privatization Administration. Going forward,
a more comprehensive approach to right sizing the public sector is urgently needed, including
sustained implementation of the privatization program and wider use of early retirement
incentives such as those in the telecommunications legislation adopted in May. Initiation of this
program would be a benchmark for PFPSAL II and its further implementation would be
supported by the PPSAL in 2002. Preparation and implementation of the program will be
coordinated with the work of the ministerial committee on civil service reform (paragraph 91).
B.    Public Expenditure Management
74.   A well functioning, transparent public expenditure management system is at the heart of
effective government. On all counts the Turkish system of public expenditure management
performs poorly not only in comparison to standards achieved by most industrial countries but
also by the standards achieved by many developing countries. In countries as diverse as France,
Australia, the United Kingdom, Sweden and New Zealand, broadly similar problems have: (i)
provoked reforms to national administration that strengthen aggregate fiscal discipline, (ii) linked
policies to budgets more effectively through multi-year budget frameworks and efforts to build
capacity for policy formulation, and (iii) initiated longer term changes in managerial behavior
and organizational culture to improve the performance of public agencies. Institutions and
budget processes have been strengthened to ensure that individual agency decisions are
consistent with the aggregate fiscal framework and priorities are effectively funded. Most
dramatic has been the clear shift away from strong central controls over details of budget
implementation. France, with a strong tradition of detailed supervision by financial controllers
similar to Turkey, has introduced "responsibility centers" that provide civil servants with
incentives and accountability mechanisms to improve quality of public services.
75.   The key elements of the Government's multi-year strategy for public expenditure
management reform are laid out in its Strategic Framework for Public Expenditure Management
Reform (Annex VII) which is the basis for the agreed actions in this area under the PFPSAL and
subsequent operations.   The Government's strategy for reforming public expenditure
management is structured around the same three objectives as pursued in other countries
(commonly referred to as levels 1-3), i.e., strengthening aggregate discipline (level 1), building
capacity for policy forrnulation (level 2), and improving the performance of public agencies
(level 3). It is consistent with the recommendations of the PEIR. The strategy is the result of
many years of internal discussion in Turkey about the need to modernize public expenditure
management, particularly at the higher levels of the government bureaucracy.  It also
incorporates recommendations from the Fiscal Transparency Review carried out by the IMF in
2000. The strategy took final shape during two weeks of participatory discussions on the draft
PEIR in Ankara. Implementing this broad PEM reform program will take several years of



- 40 -
determined effort and results will not be immediate. The Government has established a high-
level Steering Committee to coordinate implementation of the PEM reform including
representatives of MOF, Treasury, SPO, and TCA. The Steering Committee will be expanded to
include selected line ministries and agencies as needed. The reforrn focuses on three core
priority areas to support the objectives mentioned above.
*  The first priority is to reform the processes for budget preparation and execution. This
involves steps to: (i) improve the transparency and comprehensiveness of the budget in line
with international standards in order to provide the informnation required for proper policy
formulation and performance evaluation, (ii) strengthen the credibility of the budget
preparation process, (iii) build capacity for policy formulation at all levels of government
which can provide a rational orientation for the budget process and ensure that resources are
allocated to policy priorities, and (iv) realize concrete improvements in the operational
performance of line ministries and agencies through a progressive shift to perforrnance
budgeting.
*  The second priority is to upgrade public accounting, procurement and audit functions to
ensure adequate financial accountability. This encompasses legal changes to introduce
international fiduciary standards, as well as institutional changes to build capacity to
implement the new standards and shift from excessive ex ante control to effective ex post
monitoring.
*  The third priority is to ensure prudent public liability management. This involves legal
measures to establish clear lines of borrowing authority and transparent reporting of public
liabilities, as well as institutional measures to build up the capacity for modern fiscal risk
management.
76.   Budget Reform.  The Government is making good progress in improving the
transparency and scope of the budget. Under the ERL program, the number of budgetary and
extra-budgetary funds has been greatly reduced. As of March 2001, 46 budgetary funds and 6
EBFs had been closed. In June 2001, the Parliament is expected to adopt legislation to close 15
more budgetary funds and two EBFs. As a result, all budgetary funds, with the exception of the
Support Price Stabilization Fund linked to the reform of the agriculture sales cooperative unions
(ASCUs) under the ERL, and all but five EBFs will be eliminated in the 2002 budget. The
Government has committed not to create new budgetary or extra-budgetary funds. The number
of revolving funds - currently over 2,600 - which are used by local institutions to supplement
budget allocations will be cut by half by the end of 2001 as a prelude to a comprehensive review
of these funds during the first semester of 2002. In June 2001, the Government completed a new
budget classification for consolidated budget agencies in line with new GFS standards (including
full functional classification) for implementation on a pilot basis in the 2002 budget.
77.   The Government is also moving to improve the credibility of the budget preparation
process, including a rationalization of the public investment program (PIP). The budget
preparation process is largely a formality as the central agencies essentially determine the budget
allocations for the line agencies at the last minute with limited meaningful dialogue. Reflecting
problems with the budget preparation process, the PIP has more projects than can be funded
within a reasonable timeframe. While public investment in Turkey is not excessive at about 6-
6.5 percent of GNP, the size of the investment program is out of proportion with the available
resources. At the end of 1999, the PIP consisted of 5,321 projects with an estimated cost of



-41 -
US$150 billion and an unfinished balance of US$105 billion (equal to 70 percent of the
estimated total cost of projects in the public investment portfolio). The SPO estimated that the
1999 portfolio would take over 10 years to complete on average, compared to 6 years in 1994.
In the 2001 budget, the number of projects was reduced to 5,047 and the estimated average
completion time was lowered to 9 1/3 years according to SPO. However, the over-programming
problem remains senrous. This problem arises from institutional weaknesses in the budget
preparation process. including initiating an excessive number of projects relative to financial
resource availability, inadequate prioritization relative to plan objectives, inefficiencies due to
the lack of integration between investment and recurrent budgets as well as the fragmentation of
investment budgets due to earmarking revenues for specific purposes. The Government now
plans to begin to tackle the problems with the budget preparation process and PIP more
systematically. The High Planning Council will issue in June a decision for the 2002 budget
preparation process to accompany the Prime Minister's Budget Call. The decision will: (i)
provide a macro-fiscal framework for 2002 budget preparation including overall levels for the
recurrent and investment budget, (ii) establish indicative ceilings for both the recurrent and
investment budgets for ministries and line agencies, (iii) freeze the introduction of new multi-
year projects into the PIP, except for possible emergency projects, and (iv) call for a
rationalization of the PIP in the 2002 budget. The decision will include:
*  timetable for rationalization process,
*  objective of reducing expected average time to completion of the overall PIP by 20 percent in
2002 compared to the 2001 PIP along with sector-specific reductions consistent with this
overall objective,
*  global criteria for prioritizing projects, and
*  instruction to ministries and line agencies to prioritize their investment programs in line with
the ceilings, objectives and criteria.
78.   Strengthening the budget preparation process will be a graduated action. For the 2002
budget cycle, the indicative ceilings will be based on an indexation formula applied to the actual
budget allocations that each ministry and line agency received in 2001. For the 2003 budget
preparation process, the Government intends to set individual indicative ceilings for each
ministry and line agency based on the experience with the 2002 preparation process. As part of
the PIP rationalization, the Government intends to carry out a Public Investment Review on an
urgent basis and has requested support for this review from the Bank.
79.   Sustained implementation of the budget reform would be supported by PFPSAL II and
the follow-up PPSAL operation linked to the annual budget cycle for 2003. As benchmarks for
PFPSAL II, the Government plans to do the following:
* Take the remaining preparatory actions, including legal changes, required to implement the
new budget classification and coding on a pilot basis in the 2002 budget; and expansion of
the budget classification to cover all of general government as defined by GFS. The general
government definition will include: consolidated budget agencies, local government, social
security institutions, EBFs, revolving funds and autonomous agencies.



- 42 -
* Adopt a satisfactory PIP for 2002, including a 20 percent reduction in the time to completion
of on-going projects in the program, would be a further benchmark for PFPSAL II, together
with an action plan for sustaining a rational PIP beyond 2002.
*  Build up the role of policy formulation in guiding resource allocation. The objective is to
enhance the 5 year Plan prepared by SPO with input and action by line ministries and policy
reviews by the Cabinet. As an additional benchmark for PFPSAL II, SPO will prepare
guidelines for strategic planning by key line ministries and departments including guidelines
for costing policies. The Government will also initiate policy reviews by line ministries and
agencies to derive clear statement of objectives and expenditure priorities in preparation of
2002 budget. This will be complemented by action to revive the role of ministerial
departments responsible for policy reviews with support from SPO.
* Adopt a pilot program for a group of line ministries and agencies willing to volunteer for
reforrns that will provide them with greater discretionary control over inputs linked to
adoption of effective internal controls and commitment to improved performance.
80.   Rollout of the new budget classification, based on the experience with the pilot exercise
in 2001, and an enhanced preparation process for the 2003 budget--including introduction of a
rolling two-year expenditure framework, would be supported by the PPSAL in late 2002. This
operation would also support further efforts to build the capacity for policy formulation and
implementation of the pilot program to improve operational performance. By late 2003, the core
priorities of the budget reform would be well established. Together with the projected decline in
inflation under the program, the stage would be set for a progressive shift to a full medium-term
expenditure framework.
81.   Financial Accountability. Turkey's system of public financial accountability is in need
of improvement. Some of the basic building blocks appear to be in place: an established legal
framework; reliable, albeit fragmented, budgeting and accounting processes; regular reporting of
financial results; an apparently independent Supreme Audit Institution, the Turkish Court of
Accounts (TCA), which reports to Parliament; a relatively open system of accountability and
plenty of skilled personnel. But deeper analysis reveals significant problems and lack of
systemic coherence. Complex institutional relationships, multiple sources of public funds, heavy
emphasis on pre-spending controls and inadequate reporting to the legislature reduce
transparency and weaken financial management. The accounting law which governs public
sector accounting dates from 1927, and the procurement legislation has not kept up with
evolving international standards. Similar to the budget, the audit system is fragmented with
many bodies besides the TCA carrying out activities analogous to external inspection and audit,
and the reporting relationships among these bodies are ambiguous.
82.   Accounting. Action to upgrade the public accounting system is already underway with
the introduction of the say2000i automated system under the Public Financial Management
Project (PFMP) supported by the Bank. Under this internet based system, the Government's
accounting data base will be held centrally and will contain data on all individual transactions
wherever they occur in the system. Accountancies, which include some 1,500 field offices
across Turkey, will access the central system for applications software and will be able to carry
out their transactions on-line. Field installations for the say2000i system will be substantially
completed by end-June with the objective of starting full automation for consolidated budget
agencies by end-2001.



- 43 -
83.   Over the next several years, reforms to the public accounting system will proceed under
the PEM reform strategy. The Government will take necessary actions to revise the accounting
system to incorporate the new GFS classification for the budget and to introduce accrual
accounting. A phased approach is planned with the following benchmarks for PFPSAL II:
* Start full automation under say2000i system for the consolidated budget agencies.
* Revise Accounting Law (No. 1050) to incorporate new definition of general government and
allow MOF to issue accounting standards for all general government agencies in line with
new GFS classification.
* Issue new modified accrual based chart of accounts consistent with GFS for general
government.
* Develop strategy for phased introduction of accrual accounting across general government
1 6
agencies
84.   The PPSAL would support further implementation of these reforms, in particular
implementation of the revisions to the accounting law--which will inter alia allow for the budget
definition to be expanded to cover the full general government--and the phased introduction of
accrual accounting.
85.   Procurement.  The Government intends to upgrade Turkey's public procurement
legislation and procedures in line with international standards, and a new procurement law is
under preparation. The Government has announced that the new public procurement law will be
consistent with the UN's UNCITRAL standards as part of a medium-term strategy to meet full
compliance  with  EU  directives.   This graduated  approach  is consistent with  the
recommendations of the Bank's CPAR. Enactment of the new procurement law in a form
satisfactory to the Bank will be a benchmark for PFPSAL II, together with steps to initiate
preparation of a system to define qualified contractors in line with new law. The law is
expected to: (i) cover all goods, works, and services, (ii) be applicable to all central and local
government agencies; and (iii) encompass both budgetary and non-budgetary procurement. The
law should also cover non-commercialized SEEs. Implementation of the new legislation and
related efforts to strengthen institutional capacity would be supported by the PPSAL operation,
together with steps to prepare for the introduction of periodic procurement audits by TCA and
publication of the results.
86.   Auditing. The Government established in June a task force to develop a reform program
for the public audit system. The objectives of the program are two fold. First, develop a plan of
action, including necessary legal amendments, to expand scope of TCA audits to cover the entire
general government including autonomous agencies, social security institutions, remaining
EBFs, and revolving funds. Second, prepare a new law on internal financial control and audit in
line with international standards based on a review of current control, inspection and audit
processes. This new legislation will promote improvements in audit quality in line with
international standards and support the shift from ex ante controls to ex post monitoring in
harmony with the efforts to improve operational performance of budget agencies. The TCA will

adopt different bases of accounting (See International Public Sector Accounting Standards, International Federation
of Accountants, New York, 2000).



-. 44 -
discontinue involvement in budget execution in line with new law on internal financial control
and audit. The following benchmarks for the audit reform under PFPSAL II have been
established:
* TCA will include all consolidated budget agencies under its annual audit as required by the
Constitution, including the Presidency, Parliament and TCA.
* TCA's own accounts will be subject to audit with reports submitted to the Parliament.
* Government will adopt a plan of action to expand scope of TCA audits to cover the entire
general government and MOF will circulate to ministries and line agencies a discussion draft
of the new law on internal financial control and audit.
Implementation of the law on internal financial control and the shift to performance audits would
be supported by PPSAL in late 2002 and possible follow up programmatic operations in 2003.
87.   Public Liability Management. The role of the buildup of quasi-fiscal and contingent
liabilities in the state banks in triggering the November and February crises highlights the
importance of strengthening public liability management in Turkey. In 1999, as much as 10
percent of GNP was spent on quasi-fiscal programs which were not considered or included in the
budget. A growing amount of resources are committed under guarantees and other contingent
commitments without going through a formal budget framework process or evaluation of risk to
the budget. Action is needed to strengthen debt management and contain the spread of
contingent liabilities. Regulatory reforms in the electricity sector supported by the ERL are
addressing one of the main sources of contingent liabilities in the form of government guaranteed
BOT contracts. State bank reform and other actions under the financial sector reform program
are addressing another major source of contingent liabilities. In May, a Government decree was
published and legislation is expected to be adopted in June which together will eliminate all
existing legal provisions authorizing creation of duty losses in the state banks. This action will
align the legal framework with the state banks restructuring law approved in December 2000.
However, other important sources of contingent liabilities and quasi-fiscal losses persist,
including those arising from banking sector guarantees, take-or-pay contracts for natural gas
imports, non-energy BOT projects, and guarantees to municipal and local governments.
88.   Future action to improve public liability management centers around the development of
a comprehensive risk management framework. The Government intends to submit to Parliament
in June a law on public finance and debt management satisfactory to the Bank that establishes the
Treasury as the single borrowing authority for the central government. The Govermment will
also initiate in June development of a comprehensive fiscal risk management framework for the
general government which will be underpinned by the new law. Enactment of the public debt
management law will be a benchmark for PFPSAL II. In addition, the Government will conduct
a review of its guarantee portfolio and prepare a debt sustainability analysis including all
identifiable contingent liabilities of the central government. Over the course of 2002, as
elements of the risk management framework, the Government intends to: (i) develop guidelines
for the issuance of government guarantees and for borrowing by state enterprises, (ii) implement
mechanisms for monitoring government project guarantees and on-lending operations, and
develop a centralized fiscal risk analysis capability; and (iii) prepare and disclose a Government
Fiscal Risk Statement. These actions would be supported by the first PPSAL. The full
institutional structure for the new public liability management system, including all necessary



- 45 -
legal changes, should be in place by 2003, and the Government should then be in a position to
issue its public liability strategy as an annex to the future medium-term expenditure framework.
C.   Public Sector Governance
89.   Actions to improve public sector governance and reduce political influence over
economic management complement and are integrated with implementation of structural fiscal
policies and PEM reforrm. The Government has made major progress in improving the quality of
the regulatory environment in Turkey under the ERL in energy and telecommunications, and the
FSAL in the financial sector. These actions anchor the Government's efforts to depoliticize
management of the Turkish economy. Recently enacted legislation for electricity (February
2001) and gas (May 2001) has established a unified independent regulator for the energy sector.
In telecommunications, legislation enacted in January 2000 created an independent regulatory
authority and amendments enacted in May 2001 transferred all licensing authority to this
authority. On the basis of the new legislation, the Government plans to appoint a professional
Board of Directors and management team for Turk Telekom in June. Successive amendments to
the banking law have strengthened the Banking Regulatory and Supervision Agency established
in mid 1999. These new regulatory agencies form the first pillar of the Government's program
for improving public sector governance.
90.   The Government has initiated preparation of a national strategy to improve governance
and combat corruption which will encompass the on-going regulatory reforms and other
measures which are enhancing governance including legislation under preparation to improve the
code of conduct for public officials. A steering committee has been formed consisting of
representatives from the Treasury, the Prime Minister's Inspection Board, the Anti-Money
Laundering Unit of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Interior.
The objective is to develop a comprehensive approach to the issue which establishes clear
priorities and benchmarks, and empowers and energizes public opinion to fight corruption. The
strategy is viewed as integrating many on-going actions by the Government-including elements
of the PEM reform--into a more systemic framework for improving governance and reducing
political influence over the economy. The Government is also counting on the active
involvement of national NGOs. A household diagnostic survey on corruption based on a World
Bank questionnaire has been completed by TESEV and work is now beginning on a business
diagnostic survey funded in part by the Bank. To help formulate the strategy, the Government
plans to host two international conferences on Effective Government in collaboration with the
Bank. The first, scheduled for September, will focus on anti-corruption. It will be preceeded by
a workshop with key government officials on the elements of an effective anti-corruption
strategy to be held in July with the participation of WBI. The second conference, scheduled for
November, will focus on public management reforms linked to the PEM agenda. The steering
committee expects to complete preparation of the anti-corruption strategy by end-September and
its adoption and publication would be benchmarks for PFPSAL II. Implementation of the
strategy would be supported by the subsequent PPSAL operation.
91.   The medium-term agenda for improving public governance necessarily encompasses civil
service reform. Civil service reform is vital to raising the quality of public services while
adjusting aggregate government expenditure in line with medium-term resource constraints. The
Government has already initiated work on a norn cadre (staffing norms) system to establish



- 46 -
benchmarks for staffing in public agencies. This system is operational within the Ministry of
Education. As a benchmark for PFPSAL II, the Government plans to establish a ministerial
committee to carry out a full functional review of government in preparation for the civil service
reform. On the basis of this review, the Government expects to present its strategy for civil
service reform to the Parliament as part of the program for PPSAL in late 2002. Continued
implementation of the civil service reform program could be supported by subsequent
programmatic operations in the next CAS period.

IV. THE PROPOSED LOAN
A.   The Bank's Financial Sector Assistance Strategy
92.   Background. Turkey and the Bank have had a long relationship in the financial sector
since the early 1980s through a series of SALs (I-V) during the 1980-85 period and two FSALs
during the late 1980s. A number of policy and institutional reforms were undertaken during this
period. The focus of both the FSALs was on financial policies, financial institutions and
regulations, and money and capital markets. The FSAL programs were, however, only partially
completed, as Turkey's political and economic arena remained caught up in ad hoc short term
choices during most of the 1990s, making it difficult to engage in long term policy and
institutional development decisions. Thus, actions on better banking regulations and supervision
and on bank privatization still remained on the agenda in the late 1990s.
93.   Assistance strategy. After some years of lower intensity interaction during the early and
mid 1990s, the level, nature and quality of the dialogue on the financial sector policy and
institutional issues between the Bank and the Government has recently substantially increased,
and has been quite high during the past three years. The Asian crisis followed by the August
1998 crisis in Russia, necessitated a further review and analysis of the policy and regulatory
framework and a vulnerability assessment of the banking sector. Such a review was undertaken
by a Bank mission in November 1998, and based on the assessment of this mission, a financial
sector reform agenda and the Bank's financial sector assistance strategy for Turkey was
developed. This assistance strategy was further reviewed and updated during 1999 and early
2000 as part of ongoing sector dialogue and the new Country Assistance Strategy. Following the
two recent financial crises, the sequencing of the Government's financial sector reform efforts
and of the Bank's support has been amended to reflect the sector's more pressing needs, but the
core assistance strategy remains unchanged.

94.   The strategy to date has consisted of carrying out: (i) a banking sector review to
determine the vulnerabilities and policy and institutional reforrns required in the sector; (ii) a
bottom up financial intermediary operation, the Export Finance Intermediation Loan (EFIL),
approved by the Board in July 1999, to build up dialogue and consensus for reform directly with
a core group of healthy commercial banks; (iii) a comprehensive risk management workshop and
Pilot Risk Management Audits of selected banks to enhance awareness in the sector of the latest
developments and tools and techniques in the area of bank risk management; and (iv) a top down
financial sector policy-based FSAL, approved by the Board in December 2000, to address the
most pressing banking sector reform priorities. In response to the two recent crises, the proposed
financial sector reform strategy going forward comprises: (a) a corporate sector assessment,
currently ongoing, to determine the impact of the banking and macro-economic crises on the
corporate sector; (b) the proposed PFPSAL; (c) the planned PFPSAL II; (d) a Non Bank
Financial Institutions (NBFI) Review to determine the risks and vulnerabilities, as well as
development priorities of the NBFI sector; and (e) two Programmable Financial Sector
Adjustment Loans (PFSAL I-II) to address the remaining reform agenda in the banking sector
and urgent reform priorities for the NBFI sector. Elements of the Bank's strategy of lending and
non-lending assistance in the financial sector as the context for the proposed PFPSAL are
presented in Figure 6 and described below:
D Banking Sector Review (November 1998). The November 1998 Banking Sector Review
assessed the legislative, regulatory and banking supervision infrastructure, problem bank and
bank failure resolution issues, the regulations related to management of interest rate, foreign
exchange, liquidity, credit, market and operational risks in the banking sector, and the
restructuring requirements of the state-owned banking sector. The policy and sectoral reform
recommendations of the Bank were well received by the Treasury and the Central Bank, and
succeeded in laying a consensus foundation for the Government's reform effort in the sector.
The sectoral review also helped in preparing a draft FSAL policy matrix, which formed the
basis for FSAL preparation.
*  Export Finance Intermediation Loan (US$252 million, EFIL - July 1999). The EFIL
was undertaken in response to the liquidity squeeze in the export sector post Russia crisis.
The EFIL structure enables a strategic dialogue and close interaction with the major private
commercial banks and the Bankers Association in Turkey, through setting up of stricter and
upgraded prudential eligibility criteria and banking standards for capital adequacy, foreign
exchange exposure, large/connected exposures and risk management systems. Besides the
prudential criteria, a comprehensive review of the existing risk management systems and
practices at a pilot group of five banks, intended to enhance awareness and the application of
best practice standards and techniques in the management of banking risks, was carried out
for the participating banks under EFIL. The EFIL therefore continues, through a bottom up
sectoral consensus building approach, to complement the top down policy dialogue
undertaken in the context of the FSAL and the proposed PFPSAL and follow-up financial
sector loans.
*  Comprehensive Banking Risk Management Workshop (February 2000). This workshop
was held in Istanbul under the joint sponsorship of the Bank and the Basle Financial Stability
Institute, and locally hosted by the Bankers Association to discuss the latest issues related to
comprehensive and dynamic risk management in the banking sector, and the regulatory



- 50 -
approaches towards risk management in different countries. The workshop raised the
awareness of the banking community to the critical need for a comprehensive and dynamic
approach to risk management in their institutions, and facilitated the drafting of new BRSA
regulations on risk management and market risk charges for capital adequacy purposes (see
paragraph 36).
* Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (US$778 million, FSAL - December 2000). The
FSAL focused on strengthening the legislative, regulatory and supervision infrastructure for
banks, updating bank prudential regulations to EU/Basle standards, strengthening problem
bank and bank failure resolution capacity, and initiating the restructuring! privatization of
state-owned banks. Following the November 2000 and February 2001 banking crises, part of
the conditionality for the second tranche of the FSAL was overtaken by events, especially the
conditionality for the sale of one of the state banks (Vakif). Other FSAL second tranche
conditions remain highly relevant, however, and have been incorporated in the policy
matrices for the proposed PFPSAL and the planned PFPSAL II. Simultaneously with Board
approval of the proposed PFPSAL, the Government will request cancellation of the second
tranche of the FSAL.
*  Corporate Sector Assessment (May-September 2001). In response to the November 2000
and February 2001 banking and macro-economic crises, the Bank is undertaking a corporate
sector assessment to determine the impact of the crises on private sector enterprises. The
findings of this assessment and relevant policy recommendations, if any, will be incorporated
in the design of the planned PFPSAL II and the PFSAL I and II.
D  Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (US$1.1 billion, PFPSAL
- July 2001).  As part of the Bank's immediate crisis response effort, the proposed one
tranche PFPSAL, covering the most urgent banking system reform and restructuring actions,
is presented to the Board for approval.
*  Second Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (US$1.35 billion,
PFPSAL II - December 2001). Following the proposed PFPSAL, the PFPSAL II will
support the further deepening of the Government's banking system reform and public sector
restructuring efforts.
*  Non Bank Financial Institutions (NBFI) Review (Fiscal 2002). A fornal non bank
financial institutions review will be undertaken during fiscal year 2002, to analyze the
existing development issues and future reform priorities related to: (i) financial markets--
Government securities, money markets, bond markets, equities, commodities and derivatives;
and (ii) non bank financial intermediaries like securities firms, investment companies,
contractual savings institutions such as insurance companies, mutual funds and pension
funds, and the near-banks like leasing, factoring and consumer finance companies. The
review will also assess the cross linkages between the banking system and the capital markets
and NBFI segments of the financial sector, and identify key reform measures necessary to
mitigate the risks arising from such cross linkages and eventual rapid capital markets/NBFI
growth in response to the lasting macro-economic stability. The findings of this review will
serve as inputs into the design of the planned PFSAL I and II.
* First and Second Programmatic Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (US$500 million
each, PFSAL I and II - Fiscal 2002-2003). The planned PFSAL I and PFSAL II will build
up on the proposed PFPSAL and the planned PFPSAL II. The two PFSALs will address the
remaining reform agenda in the financial sector, especially issues related to: (i) the
completion of the state bank privatization agenda, (ii) deposit insurance reform; (iii) the



- 51 -
development of consolidated financial sector regulatory and supervisory infrastructure; and
(iv) regulatory issues related to capital markets, insurance and other non-bank financial
institutions like leasing, factoring, mutual funds and private pension funds.
B.    The Bank's Public Sector Assistance Strategy
95.   Background. The current assistance program for public sector reform draws on earlier
efforts. In particular, the PFMP project approved in 1995 supported an ambitious agenda to
improve the quality of public financial management in Turkey. This project has achieved
considerable results in modernizing Turkey's customs service and improving the debt and cash
management functions in the Treasury. It also supported design and development of the
say2000i automated accounting system. However, the PFMP has been less successful in
catalyzing improvements in tax administration and public expenditure management as had been
originally envisaged. Political support for these objectives was not adequately secured and
bureaucratic inertia eventually set in. The tax and PEM measures supported by the project were
seen by many in the government as technical fixes of limited significance in the absence of a
broader reform vision for the public sector. Drawing a lesson from this experience, the current
assistance strategy aims to support a comprehensive medium-term program to modernize the
public sector for which political support has been obtained in advance from the highest levels of
government. In addition, the motivation for the reform has been made crystal clear by the crisis:
without deep structural changes to the way the public sector operates in Turkey, financial
stability and sustained growth will remain elusive goals.
96.   The public sector assistance strategy is multi-faceted. Work to date has comprised
preparatory economic and sector work, and implementation of a first phase of measures to
support public sector reform under the ERL. The ESW includes: (i) the CEM which confirmed
the public sector deficit as the core source of macroeconomic instability in Turkey and detailed
reforms in support of fiscal adjustment and growth, (ii) the PEIR which presents an in-depth
diagnosis of the operational and institutional problems confronting public sector management
and outlines a strategic framework for reform, and (iii) the CPAR and CFAA which review the
current legal framework and procedures for financial accountability in Turkey and develop
recommendations for reform. The ERL program has supported implementation of the reform
agenda for social security, energy, agriculture and telecommunications which help underpin the
fiscal adjustment and contain the growth of quasi-fiscal and contingent liabilities. The ERL also
supported a first set of budget reform measures including legislation to close the first two groups
of budgetary and extra-budgetary funds in December 1999 and March 2001. The proposed
assistance strategy going forward comprises: (a) a first international conference on Effective
Government focused on anti-corruption scheduled for September and a second conference
focused on public sector management scheduled for November; (b) the proposed PFPSAL; (c)
the planned PFPSAL II; and (d) a Programmatic Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PPSAL) to
support continued implementation of the reform agenda. A second PPSAL is tentatively
envisaged in late 2003 beyond the current CAS period. Elements of the Bank's strategy of
lending and non-lending assistance in the public sector as the context for the proposed PFPSAL
is presented in Figure 7 and described below:

* Economic Reform Loan (US$760 million, May 2000). The following public sector reform
actions have been carried out under the ERL program:
*  fiscal packages introduced to underpin the 2000 and original 2001 budgets,
*  major reform to the public pension system carried out, voluntary pension pillar
introduced, and reform of agriculture support policies started;
* regulatory agencies for telecommunications and energy established; and
*  a first set of budget reform measures taken including: (a) closure of 46 budgetary funds
and 6 EBFs, (b) limits established on the introduction of new projects into the public
investment program, and (c) a public registry of government guarantees and limits on the
issuance of new guarantees established.
* Country Economic Memorandum (September 2000). The CEM analyzed the structural
sources of the public deficits including the build-up of quasi-fiscal and contingent liabilities
in the energy, banking and other sectors. The report presented in detail the Government's
program of structural reform covering social security, energy, agriculture, banking and
telecommunication, and outlined the agenda for further reform in a number of key areas. It
demonstrated how these reforms would support sustained fiscal adjustment.
* Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (expected June 2001). The PEIR, prepared
under the ERL program, presents the findings of a detailed analysis of the budget and
institutions of public expenditure management and public accountability which are
fundamental to policy decisions and economic management in Turkey. The review suggests
that the current economic crisis has deep roots in the institutions of collective decision
making in government. It shows that radical improvements to the manner in which public
policy is determined are needed, that the processes which govern the decisions regarding
resource allocation and budget implementation must be improved, and the transparency and
Parliamentary oversight over the whole process must be increased. The PEIR is a joint
collaboration with the Government. A series of participatory workshops on the report held
with the Government in May 2001 were instrumental in shaping the Government's medium-
term strategy for PEM reform.
* Country Procurement Assessment Review (expected June 2001) and Country Financial
Accountability Assessment (under preparation). These reports analyze the current legal
and institutional framework in Turkey for financial accountability and develop
recommendations for reform in line with international standards. They form the backbone of
the Bank's due diligence work on fiduciary issues in Turkey.
* First International Conference on Effective Government (September 2001). The first
conference on effective government will be co-hosted in September by the Government and
World Bank with support from WBI. The theme was good governance and fighting
corruption. It provided an opportunity to present and discuss international experience with
developing anti-corruption strategies, and provided the Government with a forum to express
its commitment to combating corruption in Turkey. It also involved local NGOs including
TESEV which presented the results of its household survey on corruption issues. The results
of the conference will help the Government to formulate its national strategy.
* Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (US$1.1 billion, PFPSAL
- July 2001). The proposed one tranche PFPSAL will cover:
* implementation of urgent additional fiscal measures to meet the post-crisis macro targets for
2001,
*  launch of a medium-term reform program to improve public management,



- 54 -
* preparation of a national strategy to improve governance and tackle corruption.
*  Second International Conference on Effective Government (November 2001). The
second international conference will serve as a venue to disseminate the PEIR findings and
strategic framework for PEM reform to both national and international audiences. It will also
help expose government officials to broader international experience with public sector
management reforms. The results of the conference will help the Government to fine tune its
program to be supported by the planned PFPSAL II and subsequent PPSALs.
*  Second Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (US$1.35 billion,
PFPSAL II - December 2001). Following the proposed PFPSAL, the PFPSAL II will
support continuation of Turkey's public sector adjustment and reform  effort.  Key
benchmarks include:
* implementation of a fiscal package to underpin the 2002 budget;
* completion of first phase of PEM reform including further action to improve budget
consolidation, rationalization of public investment program, and enactment of legislation
to introduce international procurement standards and strengthen public liability
management; and
* adoption and publication of national strategy to improve governance and combat
corruption.
*  Programmatic Public Sector Adjustment Loan (US$375 million, PPSAL - Fiscal 2003).
The planned PPSAL will build on the progress on public sector reform achieved under
PFPSAL and PFPSAL II. Benchmarks for the PPSAL include:
* implementation of a comprehensive strategy to improve tax system as part of the effort to
consolidate the fiscal adjustment;
*  steps to deepen the PEM reform agenda including implementation of the new GFS
budget classification on a pilot basis for consolidated budget agencies, implementation of
the pilot program to improve operational performance, and development of a
comprehensive risk management framework; and
* continuing efforts to improve public sector governance including preparation of a
strategy for civil service reform.
*  Possible second Programmatic Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PPSAL II Fiscal 2004).
A possible PPSAL II in the next CAS period would support further deepening of the public
sector reform agenda including: (i) implementation of a program to adjust staffing levels in
central government and SEEs, (ii) rollout of the new GFS budget classification to all
consolidated budget agencies and further implementation of the program to improve
operational performance, (iii) implementation of the new law on internal financial control
and audit, and (iv) initiation of civil service reform.
C.   PFPSAL Objectives and Description
97.   The main objective of the proposed PFPSAL is to address the Government's immediate
financial and public sector reformn priorities in the aftermath of the November 2000 and February
2001 banking system and macro-economic crises, including, in the financial sector: (i) overhaul
of the regulatory framework for banking activity; (ii) institutional development of the new Bank
Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA); (iii) problem bank/bank failure resolution; and (iv)
state bank restructuring and privatization; and in the public sector: (i) structural fiscal policies;



- 55 -
(ii) public expenditure management; and (iii) public sector governance. The PFPSAL will
provide budgetary support to help the Government finance the costs arising from the crisis while
continuing to fund its critical social programs. The subsequent PFPSAL II and follow-up
programmatic operations in the financial and public sectors will support a sustained effort by the
Government to carry out this complex reform agenda.
98.   Partial Front-end Fee Waiver. The Government of Turkey has requested a waiver of
part of the front-end fee on the proposed PFPSAL in consideration of the fee already paid on the
FSAL, the second tranche of which is to be cancelled and folded into the PFPSAL. The standard
front-end fee for FSAL amounted to US$7,777,800 which was capitalized into the loan amount
of US$777.78 million and paid to the Bank by Turkey from the first tranche disbursement of
US$392,778,900 on December 22, 2000. Following the February crisis, the financial sector
reform program is now broader than envisaged at the time FSAL was prepared, and some
elements originally expected to be part of a later operation have been brought forward, while the
phasing of some other actions has changed. As the second tranche amount of the FSAL is being
folded into the new larger financial sector reform programmatic operation, US$3.85 million of
the front-end fee of PFPSAL would be waived. This amountFN is equivalent to the front-end fee
paid for the second tranche of FSAL which will be cancelled. The request for this waiver is
justified on the basis that the second tranche of FSAL will be cancelled as a result of a revision
of the Bank's assistance strategy and lending program for Turkey to which the Bank and Turkey
agreed on the basis that the remaining substantive implementation of FSAL would take place
within the context of the programmatic approach to financial sector reform.
D.   Benefits and Risks
99.   Benefits. The principal benefits of the Loan will be to: (i) restore confidence in the
banking system and in the Government's ability to implement and sustain the required sizeable
fiscal adjustments following the November 2000 and February 2001 crises; (ii) strengthen the
foundation for an efficient and sound banking system which can be competitive in quality and
performance at the international level; (iii) reduce the vulnerability of the banking system and
enhance its capacity to withstand external shocks and thereby reduce systemic failure risk; (iv)
position Turkey's banking sector for EU accession by starting the process of aligning the
prudential regime for the banking system with applicable EU banking sector directives; (v)
support urgent fiscal measures to respond to the crisis while ensuring that social spending is
protected; (vi) lay the foundation for permanent fiscal adjustment which ensures a sustainable
path for the public sector debt and prevents a recurrence of the conditions which led to the
current crisis; and (vii) modernize the public sector through action to improve management of
public expenditure and liabilities, ensure financial accountability in line with international
standards, and raise the quality of public sector governance.
100.  Risks. The risks associated with the financial and public sector reform program are
extensive, but are outweighed by the benefits of the reforms and the risks of not proceeding.
Were the Bank not present, it is likely that the Government would have great difficulty
FN Pending approval by the Executive Directors, US$3.85 million of the front-end fee would be waived on an
exceptional basis (see paragraph 98).



- 56 -
sustaining implementation of such a complex and difficult reform program. The program
incorporates significant mitigation measures. However, given the severity of the crisis and
extent of the structural and institutional reforms required, the risks cannot be fully offset in
advance and the program will be subject to continued uncertainty as events unfold on the ground.
The three main risk factors are:
* unstable macroeconomic conditions arising from the crisis,
* a potential loss of consensus for political or social reasons, and
* institutional challenges in implementing the program, including the risk of regulatory
forbearance.
101. Macroeconomic risks. The crisis has generated a massive internal shock and it will take
time to restore stability to the financial markets under even the most optimistic scenario. The
key macroeconomic risk is that actual real interest rates will remain higher than programmed
which would affect the sustainability of the public debt and create the conditions for renewed
instability. A critical factor in achieving the projected sustained decline interest rates from the
levels immediately following the February crisis is the ability of the Government to restore
investor confidence and contain inflationary expectations. This will have to be achieved first and
foremost by maintaining the overall credibility of the program and its political leadership, and
effectively tackling the core structural weaknesses in the banking and public sectors. Given the
large increase in public debt arising from the crisis, an important near-termn risk is that of
possible shortfalls in raising resources to finance the restructuring of the state banks and the
resolution of the SDIF banks. The Government's market friendly reform strategy and the large
package of exceptional external financing from the IFIs are designed to mitigate this risk by
rebuilding confidence. Confidence will also be helped by the fact that the Government has now
outlined a detailed medium-term program for addressing the structural weaknesses in the
financial and public sectors which have built up over many years. However, the Treasury will
still have to roll over an estimated US$ 35 billion in the domestic bond market during the
remainder of 2001 and the risks involved in this roll-over remain very high. Fiscal discipline and
efforts to rebuild the confidence of domestic and international investors in Turkish sovereign
debt instruments will be essential to mitigating this risk. One measure that the Government has
undertaken is a swap of existing short-term TL securities for longer-term FX-indexed bonds.
However, the scope for this type of operation is limited given the need to avoid the assumption
of excessive foreign exchange risk by the Treasury. Acceleration of the privatization program
supported by the ERL will be important to generate resources to reduce the public debt.
Economic activity has slowed sharply since the crisis and a deeper-than-expected recession in
2001 is a distinct possibility. The actual pace of recovery of the economy will depend heavily on
the Government's ability to sustain an aggressive pace of reform. The fragility of Turkey's
banking sector and public finances will take years to correct even under the most optimistic
scenario, and the country will remain vulnerable to internal and external shocks over the medium
term.
102.  Political and social risks. The financial and public sector reforms pose major political
challenges to the Government and there are certain social risks as well. The resilience of the
coalition has faced new tests daily since February 2001, including calls from the private sector
and society at large for changes ranging from Cabinet reshuffles to elections. The ability of the
coalition to survive depends upon timely delivery of the reform program and awareness of this is



- 57 -
keeping the Government focussed on rapid implementation. At the same time, sustained
implementation of the reforms will continue to test the coalition. The commercialization and
privatization of the state-owned banks will be a major political hurdle for the Government. The
closure of Emlak and the privatization of Halk and Ziraat will have social implications as their
workforces are downsized, although this is mitigated to a significant extent by the relatively
extensive social protection programs for civil servants and public sector workers. The reform
agenda for the public sector is also politically sensitive. Institutional change may be jeopardized
by resistance of vested interest groups that would prefer to maintain the status quo. To mitigate
this risk, the program relies on strong consensus and up-front ownership of the strategy by the
Government and in particular key ministries. Sustained fiscal adjustment will have social costs
and incomes policy and action to adjust staffing levels in the public sector will be particularly
sensitive. The Government is trying to mitigate this risk by strengthening its social protection
programs and dialogue with key social partners including under the newly formalized Economic
and Social Council. Of course, the social risks of the Government's broader economic reform
program are substantial and cannot be fully mitigated despite efforts to protect social spending
and improve targeted social assistance. One further initiative that the Government has taken is to
reintroduce credit subsidies on a temporary basis for 2001 only, fully funded in the
supplementary budget under the ceilings agreed with the IMF, to ease the burden of the crisis on
farmers and small businessmen. Analytical work undertaken by the Bank points to families with
multiple children who are dependent on informal employment as particularly likely to fall
through the cracks. However, this group will also be among the first to benefit from the
economic recovery targeted by the reform program. To help build and sustain social consensus
for the program during the tough initial austerity phase, the Treasury and CBT are strengthening
their public information and outreach efforts.
103.  Implementation risks. The complex reforms which make up the program will challenge
the institutional capacity of the administration. In the financial sector, the BRSA has made
impressive strides as explained in Part II, but must continue to build up its implementation
capacity. The program includes support to the BRSA and SDIF, but their learning curves will
continue to be steep and tested by the crisis. Crisis management efforts at key Government
agencies such as the MOF, SPO and Treasury may deflect attention from slower moving public
sector reforms. Institutional capacity constraints are likely to be a serious obstacle to public
sector reform implementation at all levels of government. The need for extensive institution
building and training to move ahead with public sector reform is one of the major rationales for
the programmatic approach proposed by the Bank. The Bank will continue to provide intensive
technical support for key public sector reform measures: for the remainder of 2001 this will
include support for the development of the strategy for improving the tax system and for the
Public Investment Review. Further technical support will be provided in 2001 and the Bank
stands ready to consider financial support for selected institution-building initiatives linked to the
program.
104.  Regulatory forbearance. Satisfactory and timely failure resolution efforts by the SDIF
(for already intervened banks) and enforcement of capital restoration plans by the new Bank
Regulation and Supervision Agency for non-intervened banks are important. There is a risk that
such efforts will fall short of what is needed due to political pressure that may be put on these
agencies for a slow-down of regulatory enforcement action and general regulatory forbearance.
To mitigate these risks, the proposed program has specifically focused on strengthening both the



- 58 -
monitoring and enforcement functions of the BRSA. The monitoring of capital adequacy and
foreign exchange exposure of banks will become more frequent: on a monthly basis rather than
quarterly basis. An early risk warning system will be upgraded as part of the institutional
development program and the BRSA. The Bank is providing direct technical assistance with its
own bank specialists in this area. On the enforcement side for private banks, the BRSA will
have identified and entered into closely monitored capital restoration plans of capital deficient
banks prior to the Board presentation of this loan. This will significantly reduce the risk of
regulatory forbearance.
E.    Board Conditions
105.  The PFPSAL is a single tranche loan. All of the actions listed below will have been
completed prior to Board presentation. For further details see the policy matrix (Annex VI).
I. Macroeconomic Environment
* Satisfactory macroeconomic framework consistent with the core objectives for 2001
including positive GNP growth during the second semester, inflation of 2 percent per
month and nominal interest rates of 50-55 percent by the end of the year, and a primary
surplus for the consolidated public sector of 5.5 percent of GNP.
* Approval of a satisfactory supplementary budget for 2001 consistent with the
Government's macroeconomic objectives which also ensures satisfactory expenditure
envelopes for health, education and social protection.
II. Banking Reform
A. Regulatory Framework for Banking Activity:
- The Parliament to enact a banking law amendment: (i) allowing full tax deductibility of
all specific loan loss provisions required by the BRSA effective for the year beginning
January 1, 2001, and (ii) allowing application of connected exposure limits on a
consolidated basis while retaining the existing phase-in period in the law for connected
exposures to reach EU limits, and introducing separate exposure limits for equity
investments in non-financial subsidiaries in line with the applicable EU Directive, with a
phase-in period satisfactory to the Bank.
* The BRSA to: (i) reissue the existing loan loss provisioning rule issued by the Council of
Ministers as a BRSA regulation, and to apply the loan loss provisioning regime uniformly
to Ziraat also, thereby de facto lifting the exemption from specific provisioning for
Ziraat's agricultural support loans; (ii) issue a definition of connected exposure in line
with the applicable EU directive and to apply this definition and maximum exposure
limits on a solo and consolidated basis; and the interim targets and time-table for banks to
reach compliance with the new banking law limits on non-financial equity exposures; (iii)
amend the solo and consolidated capital adequacy regulations to change the reporting
frequency for the capital base constituting the denominator of the FX exposure limit from
quarterly to monthly; and the consolidated FX position reporting rule to change the
reporting frequency from quarterly to monthly, both with effect as of January 1, 2002.



- 59 -
*  The BRSA and any banks out of compliance with the new connected lending and non-
financial equity exposure limits has agreed to finalize by August 31, 2001 on time-bound
action plans to reach compliance.
* The Government to set up a committee comprising representatives of the Treasury, the
BRSA, the CBT, the CMB and the MOF to recommend measures (for example, setting a
minimum allowable size for repo transactions, setting a liquidity requirement for repos,
adjusting withholding taxes based on the length of liability maturities, etc.) to reduce the
risks caused by excessive use of retail repos/short-term liabilities in the banking sector.
B. Institutional Development of the BRSA:
* The BRSA to develop, and the BRSA Board to approve, a time-bound strategic plan with
clearly assigned implementation responsibilities with the objective of (i) having a
comprehensive human resource policy further assimilating its staff from different sources
and strengthening the staff training program; (ii) integrating the existing multiple
databases into a common database and a common platform for analyzing and assessing
banking risks; (iii) upgrading/developing procedures manuals for all major existing
BRSA units; and (iv) introducing the concept of relationship supervision with offsite
examiners, enforcement staff and Sworn Bank Auditors working in teams on individual
banks.
C. Problem Bank/Bank Failure Resolution:
*  The BRSA to identify all capital deficient banks in the system, and to agree capital
restoration plans with these banks, or to initiate appropriate resolution action.
*  Treasury in co-operation with the CBT to inject into the SDIF banks enough: (i)
marketable Government securities (in TL and FX) in a mix of maturities and currency
denominations carrying quarterly floating rate market-based coupon interest to ensure
that the banks have sufficient liquidity to operate and honor any deposit withdrawals, and
to recapitalize the SDIF banks up to 0 percent capital adequacy; and (ii) cash (in lieu of
the Government securities above) to retire at least two thirds of all on and off balance
sheet overnight high cost liability funding of the SDIF banks outstanding on March 16,
2001 (excluding liabilities to the CBT); and the CBT to subsequently mop up excess
liquidity through open market operations within an overall ceiling on the stock of
repurchase agreements of the SDIF and state-owned banks with the CBT by end May of
TL 7 quadrillion.
*  The SDIF to: (i) hire additionally required staff for its Collection Department; (ii) receive
approval from its Board to allow the transfer of 1,166 problem loan files above TL 75
billion of Sumer to the Collection Department; (iii) transfer 150 problem loan files above
TL 75 billion of Sumer to the Collection Department.
*  The SDIF to select a second 'transition bank' if necessary due to overload at Sumer, and
in the absence of a sale, to arrange for the revocation of these banks' licenses by the
BRSA, and to initiate the merger of Turk Ticaret, Es, Inter and Eti with either one of the
transition banks; even if any of these banks are not merged with a transition bank, their
licenses will be revoked and liquidation initiated.



- 60 -
D. State Bank Restructuring and Privatization:
*  Treasury in co-operation with CBT to inject into Ziraat and Halk enough: (i) marketable
Government securities in a mix of maturities and currency denominations carryirg
quarterly floating rate market-based coupon interest to ensure that the banks have
sufficient liquidity to operate and honor any deposit withdrawals, and to write off all
remaining duty loss claims and recapitalize the two banks up to at least 8 percent capital
adequacy; in addition, all already existing Government securities in the books of these
two banks to be reissued in uniformity with the new set of securities as necessary; and (ii)
cash (in lieu of the Government securities above) to retire at least two thirds of all on and
off balance sheet overnight high cost liability funding of the two state banks outstanding
as of March 16, 2001 (excluding liabilities to the CBT), and the CBT to subsequently
mop up excess liquidity through open market operations within an overall ceiling on the
stock of repurchase agreements of the SDIF and state-owned banks with the CBT of TL 7
quadrillion as of end May 2001.
*  The Govemrnent to appoint a new independent professional Governing Board for Halk
Bank and Ziraat Bank with the mandate to manage these banks in accordance with
commercial principles and all prudential guidelines under the banking law/issued by the
BRSA; and the Governing Board to initiate operational restructuring of the two banks,
including the closure of unprofitable branches and the reduction of redundant staff.
* The Governing Board to appoint a Restructuring Adviser for Ziraat Bank and a
Restructuring and Privatization Adviser for Halk Bank.
* The Parliament to adopt amendments to law 6219 concerning the privatization of Vakif
to allow the simultaneous sale of A and B shares, and the Govermment to agree to
authorize the simultaneous sale of the A and B shares.
III. Public Sector Reform
A. Structural Fiscal Policies:
*  Introduce a supplementary fiscal package consistent with the revised fiscal targets for
2001 including:
> Increase in the petroleum consumption tax (PCT) by at least 15 percent in May,
following a 20 percent increase in April, and subsequent full implementation of the
indexation regulation for the PCT adopted in 2000;
> Increase in standard VAT rate from 17 to 18 percent and in luxury rate from 25 to 26
percent;
> Increase in the minimum base for social security contributions by 40 percent and
increase in the contribution ceiling from 4 to 5 times the minimum base in line with
existing regulations;
Full pass through by SEEs of cost increases due to exchange rate adjustments and the
revised inflation targets; and
f Adjustment of agriculture support prices in line with the agriculture reform program
supported by the ERL.
* Enact tax regulation to expand the use of Tax Identification Numbers (TIN) to owners of
bank accounts, users of banking services and participants in financial transactions.



- 61 -
* Announce that the total number of civil servants will not increase in 2001 and commit to
implement strict policy of replacing up to a maximum of 15 percent of retiring personnel
in the SEEs including public banks, Turk Telekom and enterprises in the portfolio of the
Privatization Administration.
B. Public Expenditure Management:
*  Establish high-level Steering Committee to coordinate implementation of the PEM
reform including representatives of MOF, Treasury, SPO and TCA, and selected line
ministries and agencies as needed.
*  Adopt legislation to close the remaining 15 budgetary funds and two extra-budgetary
funds (EBFs); as a result, all budgetary funds (with the exception of the Support Price
Stabilization Fund linked to the ASCU reform) and all but five EBFs (SSF, Defense
Fund, Promotion and Publicity Fund, SDIF, and the Privatization Fund) will be
eliminated in the 2002 budget; no new budgetary or extra-budgetary funds will be
created.
*  Complete new budget classification for consolidated budget agencies in line with new
GFS standards (including full functional classification) for implementation on a pilot
basis in the 2002 budget.
-  Issue a High Planning Council Decision for the 2002 budget preparation process to
accompany the Prime Minister's Budget Call. The decree will: (i) provide a macro-fiscal
framework for 2002 budget preparation including overall levels for the recurrent and
investment budget, (ii) establish indicative ceilings for both the recurrent and investment
budgets for ministries and line agencies, (iii) freeze the introduction of new multi-year
projects into the PIP, except for possible emergency projects, and (iv) call for a

f timetable for rationalization process,
> objective of reducing expected average time to completion of the overall PIP by 20%
in 2002 compared to the 2001 PIP along with sector-specific reductions consistent
with this overall objective,
> global criteria for prioritizing projects, and
F instruction to ministries and line agencies to prioritize their investment programs in
line with the ceilings, objectives and criteria.
C. Financial Accountability:
*  Substantially complete field installations for the say2000i computerized accounting
system with the objective of starting full automation for consolidated budget agencies by
end-2001.
*  Announce that new public procurement law to be submitted to Parliament by mid-
October will be fully compatible with UNCITRAL standards as a first step towards full
compliance with EU directives.
*  Establish task force in coordination with Steering Committee to develop an audit reformn
program encompassing: (i) a plan of action, including necessary legal amendments, to
expand scope of TCA audits to cover the entire general govemment including
autonomous agencies, social security institutions, remaining EBFs, and revolving funds,



- 62 -
and (ii) preparation of a new law on internal financial control and audit in line with
international and EU standards based on a review of current control, inspection and audit
processes.
D. Public Liability Management:
* Enact COM decree and adopt legislation to eliminate all existing legal provisions
authorizing creation of duty losses in the state banks.
* Submit to Parliament a satisfactory law on public finance and debt management that
establishes the Treasury as the single borrowing authority for the central government, and
initiate development of a comprehensive fiscal risk management framework for the
general government.
E. Public Sector Governance:
* Initiate preparation of a national strategy to improve governance and combat corruption.
F.    Effectiveness Condition
106.  The PFPSAL has one special condition of effectiveness which the Government is
committed to meet by July 15, 2001. The condition is in the area of state bank restructuring and
relates to the closure of Emlak Bank which the Government has determined will require the prior
passage of legislation. The effectiveness condition is related to the item in sub-section D of
Section II on Banking Reform as follows:
"UI.     Banking Reform
D. State Bank Restructuring and Privatization:
* The Government to complete the transfer of all construction-related assets on the books
of Emlak to the Mass Housing Administration, and to complete the merger of all banking
liabilities and all performing banking assets of Emlak with Ziraat and Halk, Emlak's
banking license to be revoked and the Government to provide sufficient capital to Ziraat
and Halk in the form of marketable Government securities carrying quarterly market-
based floating rate coupon interest to allow them to absorb all losses related to Emlak's
merger, including the issuance of Mass Housing Fund securities to Emlak in lieu of the
construction related assets transferred to the MHA on a short-term basis to be exchanged
with Treasury securities within 2001."
G.   Triggers for the Follow-up Programmatic Loans PFPSAL II, PFSAL I & II and
PPSAL I & II; and Program Outcome Indicators.
107.  In view of the fact that the planned financial and public sector reform program would be
supported by the Bank through a series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans, there is a certain
flexibility in the final conditionally for each loan based on actual developments in the relevant
sectors. However, while retaining this flexibility, there are some critical necessary conditions



- 63 -
(program triggers) to be implemented in any event to ensure that the reform program is
implemented in line with the agreed program. These necessary conditions or triggers for the
follow up programmatic loans have been presented in Table 8 below along with the reform
outcome indicators. For the public sector reform component, the triggers will be refined as the
program moves forward and the set of specific outcome indicators will be expanded in
collaboration with the Government. The Government is committed to meeting all of the
benchmarks for PFPSAL 11 in the policy matrix in Annex (VI).
H.   Financial Management
108.  The Undersecretariat of Treasury will have in place adequate accounting and financial
management reporting systems for the Deposit Account. The Treasury will maintain records of
all transactions under the loan in accordance with sound accounting practices. The Government
will submit to the Bank a monthly receipts and payments account showing the transactions on
the Deposit Account, starting with the receipt of Bank funds and ending when the balance on the
Deposit Account has been reduced to nil. The Borrower shall: (a) have the Deposit Account
audited in accordance with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied by independent
auditors acceptable to the Bank; (b) furnish to the Bank as soon as available but in any case not
later than four months after the date of the Bank's request for such audit, a certified copy of the
report of such audit by said auditors of such scope and in such detail as the Bank shall have
reasonable required; and (c) furish to the Bank such other information concerning the Deposit
Account and the audit thereof as the Bank shall have reasonably requested. The audit will be
carried out at quarterly intervals as agreed with the Bank, calculated from the date funds are paid
into the Deposit Account, with suitable adjustments of timing depending on the funds left in the
Deposit Account at any point in time. The terms of reference for the audit will be agreed
between the Bank and the Borrower. Audits would end once all funds have been transferred
from the Deposit Account. In addition to the above, the Bank may request that its own staff (or a
specialist contractor working on its behalf) carry out special reviews of the Deposit Account. If,
after deposit into the Deposit Account, the proceeds of this loan are used for ineligible purposes,
the Bank will require the Borrower to either: (i) return that amount to the account for use for
eligible purposes; or (ii) refund the amount directly to the Bank.

1.    Project Implementation and Monitoring
109. The PFPSAL will be implemented in accordance with the procedures for adjustment
loans in Turkey established under the ERL and FSAL. The financial and public sector program
will be implemented by the Undersecretariat of Treasury, in cooperation with the Central Bank
of Turkey, the BRSA, the SDIF, the Ministry of Finance, the State Planning Organization, and
the Turkish Court of Accounts. The Bank will conduct regular supervision of the PFPSAL in
close collaboration with the IMF. To help ensure timely implementation of the program, the
Bank team has confirmed with the Government that each benchmark for PFPSAL II in the policy
matrix has been clearly assigned and is owned by a particular government agency. The high-
level Steering Committee established for the public expenditure management component of the
public sector reform will ensure effective cooperation among the numerous ministries and line
agencies involved in this component of the public sector reform program. Disbursement
arrangements will be fully consistent with Bank practice for adjustment loans. Upon notification
by the Bank of loan effectiveness (immediately following Board approval), the proceeds of the
loan will be deposited by the Bank into the designated Deposit Account at the request of the
Borrower. In accordance with the Operational Directive on the Simplification of Disbursement
Rules under Structural Adjustment and Sector Adjustment Loans (February 8, 1996),
disbursements will not be linked to specific purchases. The closing date for the Loan is
December 31, 2001.
110.  Monitoring. Progress will be monitored against agreed benchmarks in all areas of the
PFPSAL program. A daily monitoring system is in place with support from the IMF for key
macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates, the exchange rate, and CBT net domestic assets
and reserves. Monthly monitoring is in place for inflation, the fiscal balance and the external
accounts. In the financial sector, an upgraded monitoring framework for the banks is being
established as described in the risks section above.  Quantitative benchmarks have been
established for the social expenditure envelopes under the supplementary 2001 budget. Progress
towards these benchmarks will be evaluated in October. Benchtnarks have also bee set for the
commitments on staffing levels in the civil service and SEEs, and these will be monitored on a
continuous basis, including the extent of layoffs in the state and SDIF banks. Additional
quantitative benchmarks will be established for the public sector reform program under PFPSAL
II and subsequent operations as events unfold on the ground. An extensive monitoring of the
broader social impact of the overall reforrn program is being carried out through a combination
of activities under the PSSP, ARIP and Social Risk Mitigation Project.

REPUBLIC OF TURKEY
PRIME MINISTRY
THE UNDERSECRETARIAT OF TREASURY
Ref: BI02.1`.HIVl0.DE.01.05.PFPSAL 150691    Ankara, June 18, 2001
Mr. James D. Wolfensohn
President
The World Bank
Washington DC 20433
U.S.A.
Dear Mr. Wolfensohn,
1.  In February 2001, Turkey experienced a serious financial crisis. Since
then, we have been working intensively with the IMF and the Bank to put in place
a new and stronger multiyear macroeconomic and structural reform program with
increased emphasis on banking and public sector reforms. Our new program in
response to the crisis was announced in April. It not only seeks to preserve the
progress already achieved to date in carrying out structural reform, but also to
resume disinflation and revive growth as soon as possible. The new program
aims to restore banking sector confidence and lay the basis for a wide ranging
modemization of the public sector which will ensure sustained fiscal adjustment
and more effective govemment. It addresses the underlying problems in the
financial and public sectors that created the conditions in which the financial
crisis took place, thereby seeking to ensure that these conditions do not recur in
the future.
2.   To support implementatlon of the new program, we have requested
additional support from the World Bank and the IMF. A linchpin of the program is
a dramatically stepped up effort to address a series of longstanding banking and
public sector reform issues, in addition to continued implementation of structural
reforms to support private sector development We had already initiated efforts
to address these issues under the financial sector reform program supported by
the Bank's Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL) and the program supported
by the Economic Reform Loan (ERL). The February 2001 crisis has made clear,



however, that a much more aggressive and accelerated effort is necessary to
restore banking system safety and to instill confidence in the sustainability of our
fiscal policy and public sector management. Therefore, we are requesting the
Bank to provide Turkey with a seres of new quick-disbursing loans under the
current CAS starting with two single tranche Programmatic Financial and Public
Sector Adjustment Loans (PFPSAL and PFPSAL II), and to cancel the second
tranche of FSAL. Below, we present our multi-year reform effort in the financial
and public sectors in more detail.
3.   Our new program places great emphasis on protecting the social welfare
and human capital of Turkey's citizens. The supplementary budget for 2001
approved by Parliament on June 14 maintains adequate expenditure envelopes
for health, education and social protection even as overall spending is reduced
as a share of GNP in line with the new macroeconomic targets. The budget will
allow the Govemment to maintain aggregate spending on educabon slightly
above  the average levels of 1998-2000 (as a share of GNP) and actually
increase expenditure on social protection. Overall public spending on health is
also projected to remain above the 1998-2000 average level. Savings are
expected to come from efficiency gains in health expenditures for civil servants
under the administrative reform of the social security system supported by the
ERL program.  Part of these savings are being channeled into increased
expenditure on preventive and primary care. In addition to protecting social
spending in the budget, we intend to strengthen our social protection programs,
with the support of the World Bank, including through a proposed Social Risk
Mitigation project. We also intend to complete the actions agreed to under the
Economic Reform Loan (ERL).
1.   Turkey's Medium-term Financial Sector Reform Program
4.   We have already put in place several measures to address the most
urgent banking system issues post March 2001 crisis, especially as they relate to
regulatory reform, initiation of capacity building at the BRSA, stepped-up
resolution of the growing number of failed SDIF banks and the urgent financial
and govemance restructuring of the state-owned banks. In order to fully restore
and strengthen banking system safety and productivity on a sustainable basis,
and to develop the non-bank segments of our financial system in support of
private sector growth, we plan to implement the financial sector reform and seek
the Bank's support for these reform measures in two phases. The first phase will
consist of (i) all urgent legal, regulatory, and structural reforms necessary to
begin the restructuring of the banking sector as mentioned above in the first
PFPSAL in June 2001; and (ii) the remaining urgent reforms that we expect to
implement by December 2001. These measures comprise of additonal banking
regulatory reform, further institutional strengthening of the BRSA, finalizing the
2



resolution of the current group of SDIF banks and initiating the privatization and
operational restructuring of the state-owned banks. We request the Bank's
support for these measures under PFPSAL It.
5.   The second phase of the financial sector reform  program  will be
undertaken during the calendar year 2002/2003. During this period, we intend to
complete the overhaul of the banking system regulatory regime and implement
non-bank financial institutions (N8Flycapital markets regulatory reform, further
deepen the institutional development effort at the BRSA and initate such efforts
at the SDIF, continue the bank failure resolution as necessary and overhaul the
NBFI failure resolution regime, and complete state bank privatization.
6.   The details of the proposed financial sector reforms are presented below
under four major headings; namely (i) Regulatory Framework for Banking and
Non-Bank Financial Institutions; (ii) Institutional Development of BRSA and SDIF;
(iii) Problem Bank/Bank Failure Resolution, and (iv) State Bank Restructuring
and Privatization.
Recgulatory Framework for Banking and Non Bank Financial Institutions
7.   Loan Loss Provisioning. The current loan loss provisioning rule was
adopted by the Council of Ministers (the responsible authority for issuing banking
regulations before the new 8RSA was created) in December 1999. While the
new rule was a major improvement over the previous, much more lenient rule, it
was still not fully in line with best practice standards. Remaining weaknesses
included Ziraat Bank being exempted from classifying and provisioning
agicultural support loans, the use of mechanistic provisioning percentages and
collateral classification & valuation rules and unfavorable tax treatment of specific
provisions. To remedy these weaknesses, the BRSA will reissue in June 2001
the current loan loss provisioning rule in its own name, while lifting the exemption
from classification and provisioning for Ziraat's agricultural support loans.
Additionally, Parliament has enacted an amendment to the banking law allowing
specific provisions to be treated as a tax deductible expense effective in the year
beginning January 1, 2001. We intend to further strengthen the loan loss
provisioning rule to address the above referenced remaining deficiencies and to
bring the rule fully in line with international best practice standards.
8.   Large/Connected Exposures.   The December 1999 banking law
introduced new, lower limits for banks' connected exposures, phased-in in a
step-wise fashion to reach compliance with EU Directive levels by the end of
2006. The BRSA was to issue an EU Directive compliant definition of connected
exposure to operationalize the new limits. The issuance of this definition got
delayed because of protracted discussions with the banking sector. The recent
3



banking crises have highlighted the importance of accelerated reform in this
area. Therefore, Parliament has enacted further amendments to the banking law
introducing new separate limits for equity ownership in non-financial entities.
These new limits will be phased in over a period of 8 Y2 years, for banks to be in
full compliance with EU non-financial equity ownership standards by 2009.
Additionally, the amendment also mandates the application of exposure limits
on both a solo and consolidated basis. The BRSA also will issue in June the new,
EU Directive based definition of connected exposures, as well as a regulation
setting the interim targets and time-table for banks to reach compliance with the
new equity ownership limits. Furthermore, the BRSA will by August 31, 2001
enter into time-bound action plans with all banks out of compliance with the new
limits. Additionally, during all of 2002 the BRSA will continue to proactively
monitor and enforce the impfementation of the action plans for banks with excess
connected lending and equity exposures to reach compliance with the new
banking raw limits.
9.   FX Exposure. During 1998-99, the maximum open FX position'limit for
banks was reduced in a stepwise fashion from 50 percent of regulatory capital in
June 1998 to 20 percent in September 1999. In December 1999 the limit also
became applicable on a consolidated basis. A new Basle compliant BRSA
regulation imposing a capital charge on banks for their open FX positions was
issued in February 2001 and will become effective on January 1, 2002 on a solo
basis and July 1, 2002 on a consolidated basis. While these actiQns are steps in
the right direction, the current regime still contains several weaknesses, including
different reporting frequencies for open FX positions and capital adequacy,
opportunities for balance sheet wvindow dressing and the use of structured
finance products to run up open FX positions in circumvention of the 20 percent
limit. Additionally, the larger banks are lobbying the BRSA and the Central Bank
of Turkey (CBT), which monitors compliance with a separate liquidity based FX
exposure rule, to abolish the existing rules in anticipation of the introduction of
the market risk charge. To address these concerns, the BRSA will issue in June:
(i) an amendment to the capital adequacy rules increasing the reporting
frequency for both solo and consolidated capital from quarterly to monthly; and
(ii) an amendment to the consolidated FX position reporting rule to change the
reportng frequency from quarterly to monthly, both to be effective from January
1, 2002. During the next six months, in order to facilitate preparation of the
above consolidated financial reports from the banks and non-bank financial
subsidiaries within the same group, the BRSA will work jointly with the Treasury's
NBFI & Insurance Departments and the 'CMB to harmonize the reporting
frequency of all financial statements (i.e. of banks' financial subsidiaries). To
further reduce the FX exposure risks of the banking system, we intend to create
a working group comprising BRSA and CBT staff, extemal auditors and banks to
catalogue the use by banks of structured finance products to incur FX exposures
4



not captured by existing regulation. This working group will formulate remedial
regulatory action to capture such exposures. The recommendations of the
working group will be implemented by the BRSA during 2002. Additionally, the
BRSA will announce its intention to undertake surprise on-site examinations, in
coordination with foreign supervisors where necessary, to verify compliance with
consolidated FX open position limits between reporting dates. Finally, the BRSA
and the CBT - being keenly aware of the risks involved in a preliminary lifting of
FX exposure limits in advance of full operationalization of the BRSA's new
market rsk charge regulation on January 1, 2002 - have committed not to
abolish these limits until onsite examinations have confirmed that banks' risk
management systems and the market risk charge regulation are functioning
satisfactorly.
10.  Repurchase (Repo) Transactions. Turkey has a significant retail
repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement (repo/reverse repo) market. Prior
to December 2000, in order to encourage secondary market liquidity, the
repo/reverse repo market enjoyed more favorable withholding tax rates than
bank deposits. Followng the equalization of the withholding tax regime in
December 2000, commercial banks primarily sold repos to their retail customers
to circumvent the C8T's reserve requirement on deposits. In February 2001, as
repo rates rose to 6,200 percent per annum, many customers cancelled their
time deposits and moved into repos, forcing some banks into heavy interbank
borrowing. As a first step to curb such destabilizing activities in future, we have
set up a working group comprising of representatives from the Treasury, the
BRSA, the CBT, the CMB and the MOF, to recommend measures (e.g. setting
the minimum allowable size of repo transactions, setfing liquidity requirements for
repos, adjusting withholding taxes based on length of liability maturities, etc.) to
reduce the risks caused by excessive use of retail reposlshort-term liabilities in
the banking sector. Taking into account the recommendations of this working
group, we shall implement measures as necessary to reduce such risks by the
end of December 2001. To further enhance the transparency of the repo market,
the BRSA will  also require banks to bring repos on balance sheet as
collateralized finance transactions as of the beginning of January 2002.
11. Taxation and Corporate Law Reform to Encourage Merger and
Consolidation in the Financial Sector and to Facilitate Separation of
Financial Industrial Groups. We believe that, in order to strengthen the capital
structure, and to reverse the fragmentation of resources of the banking sector, it
is necessary to encourage mergers and consolidation in the banking sector in
Turkey. At the same time in order to facilitate efficient financial flows among
several financial entities within a single business group, and to better manage
and supervise the inherent risks on a consolidated basis for the group financial
insttutons (which is essentially required because of the public trust role of such
5



institutions), 't is necessary to separate the financial and industrial activities of the
financial industrial groups (FlGs) in Turkey into separate financial and industrial
holdings. However, at this time any such mergers, consolidation or separatCon
activity has several taxation (e.g. VAT, banking and insurance transaction tax)
and corporate law disincentives. As part of our reform effort we will review and
amend as necessary corporate and tax legislahon to encourage mergers and
consolidation in the financial sector, and to facilitate transformation of financial-
industrial groups into separate financial and corporate conglomerates-
12.  Prudential Regulations for Non Banking Financial Institutions.
During 2002, we also wish to undertake a review of the prudential regulations
regime for the non-banking financial institutions, to reduce their vulnerability
against potential macroeconomic volatility and to facilitate a more accelerated
growth of non banking financial activity in Turkey including equity and fixed
income securities markets, insurance, mutual funds and pension funds. Though
we plan to undertake a more comprehensive assessment of the NBSFI sector
needs with the help of the Bank during 2002, some of the focus areas we have
identified as priority for reform are: (i) To review of the need for, and introduce if
necessary, newltighter FX and large/connected exposure limits for insurance
industry and other non-bank financial institutions; (ii) Adopton by Parliament of a
new insurance law in line with applicable EU Directives; (iii) Adoption by
Parliament of amendments to applicable legislation to equalize absolute
minimum capital requirements for private pension funds and life insurance
companies involved in pension funds; (iv) Strengthening the regulatory and
governance structure of all insurance companies' and other financial institutions'
employee pension funds; (v) Completion of a review of all other prudential rules
applicable to NBFI activity (insurance, leasing, finance, factoring, pension funds,
mutual funds, asset management) and adoption of a formal plan to overhaul
these rules as necessary to bring them in line with applicable IAIS/IOSCO and
other international standards; (vi) Completion of full introducton of IAS for banks
and non bank financial institutions, including IAS 29 with an appropriate phase-in
period and LAS 39; Activation of the new Accounting Standards Board mandated
by the Capital Markets Law; Revision of Istanbul Stock Exchange listing and
disclosure rules for all financial institutions; Overhaul of the licensing regime for
auditors of banks and other financial insbtutons; and (vii) Initiation of a review of
the overall tax regime for financial transactions & activity and identification of all
tax structures that favor or discriminate against certain types of financial sector
activity; and preparation of amendments to tax legislation with a view to eliminate
any biases in favor or against certain types of financial sector activity (with the
possible exception of individual retirement products).
Institutional Development of the BRSANSDIF
6



13.  BRSA (Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency).    The  BRSA
since its creation on August 31, 2000 has made remarkable progress towards its
operationalizatfon, but the November 2000 and February 2001 banking sector
crises have diverted attention and energy away from its own institutional
development agenda, which remains unfinished. Therefore, the BRSA today
needs further strengthening and improvement in several areas. These include: (i)
harmoniting staff structure; BRSA staff came from five different departments
within the Undersecretarat of Treasury, the Ministry of Finance and the Central
Bank and, while these staff now work within a single organization, they continued
to operate on a semi-independent basis and till recently were still being paid
using their previous employers' pay scales, diminishing the potential benefits of
creating a single regulatory authority for the banking sector; (ii) the maintenance
by each function within the BRSA (e.g., offsite monitoring, on-site monitoring,
enforcement, licensing) of separate databases and the use of different analytical
rnodels to assess the condition of individual banks, resulting in sometimes
conflicting analyses and policy recommendations being made by the different
departments to senior BRSA management; (iii) the need for upgraded detailed
oroedures manuals for each BRSA function; while BRSA staff are aware of their
task responsibilities and the procedures to be followed in case of
regulatory/supervisory and enforcement action to be undertaken, these
procedures are currently not documented or the manuals that do exist are out of
date; (iv) need for integration of offsite monitoring, onsite monitonng and
enforcement activit y, for example, when onsite examiners (called Swom Bank
Auditors) go onsite in a bank, offsite and enforcement staff are not allowed to
participate in these site visits; additionally, till recently the findings of the onsite
examiners were not fed back to the offsite department for correcting the offsite
information on the banks concemed; (v) the need for a specific problem bank unit
within the enforcement function; it is the responsibility of the BRSA's enforcement
division to work with any bank which is in violation of the banking regulations;
however, the division's capacity is stretched due to the need to focus on both
large numbers of such non-compliant banks as well as financially distressed
banks requiring more 'hands on' attention and possibly the application of different
skills to those available in the enforcement division; (vi) the need for an earlv
waming system that could guide the efforts of the onsite examiners and provide
input in determining the onsite examination cycle; and (vii) need for developing
the concept of isk-based supervision, with the onsite examiners being mostly
focused on compliance testing rather than on identifying banking isks and
assessing the quality of the rsk management undertaken by bank managers.
14.  To start strengthening the institution, BRSA management will develop, and
the BRSA Board will adopt in June a time-bound strategic plan with clearly
assigned implementation responsibilities to: (i) put in place a comprehensive
7



numan resource policy to assimilate staff from different sources and to
strengthen staff training; (ii) integrate the existing multiple databases into a
common database and a common plafform for analyzing and assessing banking
risks; (iii) upgradeldevelop procedures manuals for all major existing BRSA units;
and (iv) introduce the concept of relationship supervision with offsite examiners,
enforcement staff and Sworn Bank Auditors working in teams on individual
banks. By December 2001 we expect the BRSA to have made significant
progress towards implementing the Institutional development activities outlined in
its June 2001 strategic plan. The BRSA will also at that time set up a new
problem bank unit within its enforcement function, to allow a more targeted
monitoring and follow-up of problem banks. The new unit will operate on the
basis of a pre-failure corrective action manual that Mil define pre-failure
intervention triggers (effectively defining a 'problem bank') and pre-failure
corrective action procedures to be administered by the new unit. Additionally, the
GovernmentBRSA will review the salaries of BRSA Board members and staff
and will bring them in line with the prevailing salary scales for similar professional
staff in the banking sector, in any event not less than the comparable salaries at
the CBT or CMB.
15. Institutional Development of the SDIF (Savings Deposit Insurance
Fund). The SDIF at this stage will also initiate a comprehensive institutional
development effort, through preparation of a time-bound strategic plan, with
clearly assigned implementation responsibilities, that (i) puts in place a more
effective organizational structure, with clearly separated line responsibilities for
bank resolution effort, asset management efforts, administration of the blanket
guarantee & the deposit insurance scheme and supporting functions such as
legal, human resources and information technology; (ii) sets performance targets
for the bank resolution and asset management functions; (iii) envisages the hiring
of additional qualified staff to handle the high volume of non-performing loans
and other problem assets to be transferred to the Collections Department for
collectiontworkout; and (iv) builds a centralized and high quality management
information system that will allow SDIF senior management and the SDIF Board
to monitor progress being made towards reaching agreed resolution and asset
management/collection targets. The plan will be formally submitted for approval
to the SDIF Board by late 2001, and will be implemented during 2002. In
additon, during 2002 (or even earlier if feasible), we plan to ensure the future
functioning of the SDIF on a sound financial foobng, and plan to cancel all
outstanding SDIF debts to the Treasury arsing from the receipt of Treasury
securities needed for the resolution of the pipeline of failed banks.
16. Deposit Insurance Reform (Removal of Blanket Guarantee, Autonomy
for SDIF, Bring Deposit Insurance to EU Standards). The institutional
8



development of SDIF can not be successfully completed till the policy on the long
term mandate of SDIF is clearly articulated. In this context, during 2002, we plan
to remove the blanket guarantee to all commercial bank depositors and creditors
presently in force under crsis conditions, and replace it with a deposit insurance
regime consistent with the EU standards on Deposit Insurance. At the same
during 2002, we shall review the effective functioning of the SDIF's present
govemance and management structure as a subsidiary of the BRSA, and revise
as necessary.
17. Consolidated Regulation and Supervision of Financial Activities of
Conglomerates. The Turkish financial sector consists of financial-industrial
conglomerates with commercial banks in the center of such groups, surrounded
by a number of financial subsidiaries in the areas of insurance, leasing and
factoing, capital markets, and mutual funds. Many of these financial subsidiaries
as well as the parent bank have both loan and equity exposures to the same
groups of clients. Until very recently, the prudential lending limits applicable to a
commercial bank's exposure to its clients also applied to its exposure to its
financial subsidiaries, but capital adequacy and foreign exchange exposure rules
did not apply to banks on a consolidated basis. We have now rectified these
shortcomings in the prudential framework for banks through the introducton of
consolidated large and connectedAnsider lending limits, and capital adequacy
and foreign exchange exposure rule requirements, and plan to monitor the
implementation of these new rules on a consolidated basis for such financial
conglomerates.
.18. However, the overall process af consolidated regulation and supervision is
quite complex because of the current existence in Turkey of a number of different
regulatory and supervisory bodies; e.g., the banks are regulated by the new
BRSA; the insurance sector is regulated by the Treasury's General Directorate of
Insurance and Board of Insurance Auditors the Insurance Supervisory Office of
the Treasury; leasing and factoring activities are supervised by the Treasury's
Banking and Exchange Department, investment and brokerage companies,
mutual funds and investment trusts are regulated by the Capital Markets Board;
private pension funds will be regulated jointly by the Treasury's General
Directorate of Insurance and Board of Insurance Auditors and the Capital
Markets Board: and bank and insurance company pension funds are regulated
by the Ministry of Labor and Social Security and the General Directorate of
Foundations. This dispersion of regulatory and supervisory responsibility across
muliple Government agencies carres the risk of creating insufficient, overlapping
or even conflicting regulatons and operating standards, thereby reducing
regulatory efficiency and imposing an unnecessary burden on the financial
institutions concemed. In order to further improve the consolidated supervision
infrastructure, we plan to undertake a non-bank financial institutions sector
9



review with the assistance of the World Bank in late 2001/early 2002, and
incorporate applicable recommendations and conclusions from this review in the
latter part of our mult-year financial sector reform program.
Problem Bank/Bank Failure Resolution
19.   Private Banks (Monitoring and Addressing Current and Future
Capital Adequacy). Due to the November 2000 and February 2001 crises, the
capital base of nearly all of the private, domestically owned deposit taking banks
(28 banks in total as of end May, 2001 excluding SDIF banks) has been
weakened substantially. Stress tesfing has confirmed that as a result of the
combined impact of interest rate, exchange rate and credit risk shocks, many of
the banks concemed either already have suffered, or are likely to suffer, from
capital inadequacy in the near future. These capital deficits among such private
banks range from temporary non-compliance with the 8 percent minimum capital
adequacy ratio requirement, to permanent insolvency and inability of some of the
banks concerned to survive on their own. In order to remedy this potenfially
systemic capital shortfall, during the perod March-May, 2001 the BRSA has
undertaken the following actions:
The BRSA has, in the aftermath of the February crisis, instructed all private
commercial banks, except well-capitalized banks, not to pay dividends and to
retain all year 2000 earnings;
* Through a combination of offsite analysis and on-site examinations, the BRSA
has identified all capital deficient banks, and the likely size of the already
apparent, or soon to be apparent capital shortfall in each bank concerned:
* The BRSA has held in-depth discussions with each bank concerned on the
need to prepare time-bound capital restoration plans, including in some
instances the need for the merger of multiple weaker banks that belong to the
same financial-industrial group into one larger, stronger bank; and
* The BRSA has also publicly announced that it is seeking credible capital
restoration plans on a system-wide basis.
By end June 200i, the BRSA will enter into capital restoration plans with all
banks concerned.
With the help of close proactve supervision and enforcement, BRSA will ensure
that the capital restoraton plans for capital deficient banks are implemented in a
satisfactory manner or, altematively, arrange for SDIF intervention, and the SDIF
stands ready to intervene in these banks in case these plans fail.
20.  Bank Failure Resolution.    We initiated our effort to acoelerate the
resolution of problem banks by the BRSA and failed banks by the SDIF with the
10



passage of the December 1999 banking law that gave the BRSA more powers
to impose correctve actions on problem banks, and provided the SDIF with an
extended range of resolution options to deal with problem banks. Pre-crises, the
BRSA was already using its enhanced powers under Article 14 with a view to
rectify problems at a growing number of privately owned problem banks. The
resolution effort at the SDIF, on the other hand, got under way in earnest only
after September 2000 for several reasons: (i) lack of a mechanism to finance the
SDIF's resolution outays; (ii) inertia and uncertainty at the Treasury (previously
responsible for bank supervision) and the SDJF in anticipation of their transfer to
the new BRSA on August 31, 2000; and (iii) lack of a coordinated policy for the
provision of lender of last resort financing by the CBT in manner consistent with
the Net Domestc Asset ceiling under the IMF Stand-by Agreement. The stepped-
up efforts by the SDIF to sell banks under its control as going concerns were not
successful, however, especially in the wake of the November 2000 and February
2001 crises. To date, the SDIF has not yet sold any bank, and the post cnses
environment is not very conducive to sales.
21.  To accelerate failure resolution, we have already undertaken the following
steps:
T he SDIF has arranged for the revocation of the licenses of five banks (Ege,
Yurt, Yasar, Kapital and Ulusal) and merged them into Sumer Bank as a
transition bank. The branches of these banks are being closed and their staff
is being laid off; and
- The Undersecretariat of Treasury in cooperation with the CBT has injected
into the SDIF banks enough (i) marketable Govemment securibies (in TL and
FX) in a mix of maturities and currency denominations carrying market-based
floating rate coupon interest to ensure that the banks have sufficient liquidity
to operate and honor any deposit withdrawals, and to recapitalize the SDIF
banks up to 0 percent capital adequacy; and (ii) cash (in lieu of the
Govemment securities above) to retire at least two thirds of all on and off
balance sheet ovemight high cost liability funding of the SDIF banks; the CBT
has subsequently mopped up excess liquidity through open market operations
within an overall maximum limit of TL 7 quadrillion of stock of repurchase
agreements of the SDIF and state-owned banks with the CBT.
By the end of June, we will complete the following further steps:
a The SDIF will: (i) hire additionally required staff for its Collection Department;
(ii) receive approval from its Board enabling the transfer of 1,166 problem loan
files (each above TL 75 billion) from Sumer bank to the Collection
Department; and (iii) complete the transfer of 150 of the above files. In
addition, the SDIF will amend its regulations to reflect the recent amendments
II



in the banking law, and adopt the necessary organizational structure and
operating procedures for the Collection Department by August 31, 2001 ;and
* The SDIF Board will select a second 'transition bank' to avoid overload at
Sumer, and will revoke ,the license and initiated the mergerAiquidation 'of Turk
Ticaret, Es, Inter and Eti with either one of the transition banks.
22.  In addition, before the end of December 2001, the SDIF will undertake the
following additional steps: (i) sell Ekspres, Demir and lktisat, or revoke their
licenses and merge them with the transition bank(s); (ii) resolve Sumer and the
second transiUon bank through sale or license revocation/liquidation; and (iii)
complete transfer of all problem loan files (above TL 75 billion) to the Collection
Department, and either reach a negotiated settlement with the loan defaulters or
initiate legal action for collection on all these files. These measures will result in
the complete resoluton of the existing pipeline of 8 SDIF banks by year end
2001.
23. Besides the resolution of the existing pipeline of 8 SDIF banks, SDIF will
by the end of December 2001, intervene in all those banks that are unable to
raise the necessary capital as per the capital restoration plans, and begin the
implementation of satisfactory SOIF resolufion acton for such banks. All such
remaining resolution of new SDIF banks will be completed during 2002.
24. Bankruptcy, Collateral Legislation and Infrastructure. To facilitate
resolution of non-performing loans (NPLs) by both the Collections Departnent of
the SDIF and banks or third parties that might acquire such NPLs, we intend to
undertake a coordinated review of the improvements required in the legal
framework for bankruptcy and collateral foreclosure, and to seek Parliamentary
enactment of the changes required to allow accelerated/more efficient NPL
resolution. We will also prepare a plan for the creation of a new central register
for the registration of movable collateral.
Restructurina and Privatization of the State-Owned Banks
25, Ziraat, Halk & Emlak. Over a third of banking system assets and deposits
are accounted for by 4 large state-owned banks (Ziraat, Halk Emiak and Vakif).
Longstanding public service related socially subsidized lending activities under
the Govemments govemance and ownership of these banks has steadily eroded
the financial condition of these banks. For Ziraat and Halk, enormnous subsidy
related losses have been incurred under the umbrella of illiquid Govemment
"duty losses" (paper claims on the Government carried on the bankse books) for
the last five years as a by-product of subsidized, directed lending for agricuiture
and small business development. These losses increased from US$2.8 billion at
the end of 1995 to almost US$23 billion at the end of April 2001 (the number
12



would have been even higher at pre-crisis exchange rates). The distortion in the
money markets caused by the liquidity shortfalls experienced by the two banks
as a result of the rapid build-up of the duty loss claims was one of the principal
propagators of the November 2000 and February 2001 banking crises Emiak
has also accumulated significant losses through its construction related activities
and non-performing loans, and the bank was already insolvent even before the
November 2000 crisis.
26.  Pre-crises, we had already initiated the financial and ownership
restructuring of the state banks. In November 2000, Parliament enacted an
amendment to the law on Vakif allowing the sequential sale of the 8 shares and
A shares held by the General Oirectorate of Foundatfons. In August of that same
year, Vakif engaged an investment banks fwr the sale of B shares through an
initial public offerng. The Govemment also initiated the commercialization and
financial restructuring of Emlak during late 1999 and early 2000 by removing the
stock of housing from its books. In December 2000, at the initiative of the
Undersecretariat of Treasury, new legislation was submitted to, and enacted by
Parliament that: (i) allowed Ziraat, Jlalk and Emiak to be completely privatized;
(ii) selectively removed the application of state economic enterprise legislation
(Decree Law No. 233 and related laws) to the banks in preparation for their
privatization; and (iii) allowed the Government to undertake any restructuring
actions necessary to prepare these banks for privatization. Restructuring Boards
had been created for the banks and management had begun to formulate
operational restructuring plans. We had envisaged a 2-3 year timeframe for the
privatization of Halk and up to 4 Y/z years for Ziraat. However, the destabilizing
effect of the state banks on the whole banking system has made it clear that the
process of state bank restructuring and privtization must be significantly
accelerated to restore banking system stability and confidence.
27. Financial and Governance Restructuring of the State-Owned Banks.
Therefore, we have taken the following actions in cooperabon with the CBT and
the BRSA:
* Injection into Ziraat and Halk of enough (i) marketable Government securties
at market terms in a mix of maturities and currency denominations with
interest paid quarterly to ensure that the banks have sufficient liquidity to
operate and honor any deposit withdrawals, allow the write-off of all remaining
duty loss claims and the recapitalizaton of the two banks to 8 percent capital
adequacy; in addition, we have reissued all already existing Government
securities in the books of these two banks carying non-market terms with
similar marketable Government securities; and (ii) cash (in lieu of the
Government secuities above) to allow the two banks to retire their on and off
balance sheet overnight high cost liability funding; the CBT is currently in the
13



process of mopping up the excess liquidity injected into the system as a result
through open market operations within an overall ceiling on the stock of
repurchase agreements of the SDIF and state-owned banks as of end May
2001 of TL 7 quadrillion; and
Appointment of a new independent professional Goveming Board for the two
banks with the mandate to manage these banks in accordance with
commercial principles and all prudential guidelines under the banking
law/issued by the BRSA. the Goveming Board has initiated the operational
restructuring of the two banks, including the closure of unprofitable branches
and the reducbon of redundant staff;
By the end of June, we will have completed the following additional action:
* Appointment by the Governing Board of a Restructuring Adviser for Ziraat and
a Restructunng and Pnvatization Adviser for Halk.
By July 15, 2001 we will complete the following further actions:
* The merger of all banking liabilities and all performing banking assets of
Emlak with Ziraat and Halk, the revocation of Emlak's banking license, and
provision of sufficient capital in the form of marketable Govemment securities
carrying quarterly market based floating rate coupon interest to Ziraat and
H alk to allow them to absorb all losses related to Emlak's merger, including
the issuance of Mass Housing Fund securities to Emiak in lieu of the
construction related assets transferred to the MHA on a short-term basis to be
exchanged with Treasury securities within 2001.
28.  Operational Restructuring. At this time, we also intend to initiate the
operational restructuring of Halk and Ziraat. We expect that under the oversight
of the new independent Govemance Board, Ziraat will make substantial progress
towards the closure of unprofitable branches and will also be able to reduce a
large part of its excess staff through early retirement packages and altemative
placements. In the latter area, we are targeting substantial progress in this area
by end 2001 and expect to complete the process of unprofitable branch closures
and excess staff lay-offs during 2002.
29.  In case of Ziraat specifically, we will undertake a review of its products,
services and operating structure to be able to develop a strategic model for
delivering agricultural services on a commercial basis. For this purpose, we will
review such successful models in other parts of the World including Europe, and
seek technical assistance as necessary. Additionally, we will identify all public
service functons of Ziraat, and review all the options to determine how such
services should be provided on a cost neutral basis in future (whether by Ziraat
14



or transferred to other entities, or even offered through other banks, or a network
of the postal service being several of the potential options), and formally adopt a
transfer plan through issuance of necessary decrees/legislation. We expect to
achieve this in 2002.
30.  Privatization of Halk and Ziraat. With the financial and governance
restructuring anticipated to be completed by mid 2001. and operational
restructuring underway in the coming months, the sustainability of the structural
reform in this area will be sustained by shifting the focus to ownership change
through effective privatization of Halk and Ziraat In this area, we expect to (i)
complete the full resolution of Halk, resulting in either 100 percent private
ownership of the bank or the merger with/acquisition of the bank with another
bank: (ii) appoint a Pivatization Adviser for Ziraat; and (iii) carry out the sale of
shares in Ziraat to private sector entities resulting in majority private ownership
and control (more than 51 percent).
31.  Vakif Privatization.    Furthermore, we have submitted and Padiament
is expected to adopt in June an amendment to the legislation concerning the
privatization of Vakif to allow the simultaneous sale of A and B shares. We have
also decided to authorize the simultaneous sale of the A and B shares. By
December 2001 we intend to complete the prvatizaton of all remaining
Government ownership (75 percent) in Vakif, resulting in this bank becoming fully
privately owned and controlled.
It.  Turkey's Public Sector Reform Program
32. The Government has moved decisively to strengthen the fiscal adjustment
in response to the crisis and to initiate a broader based program of reforms in the
public sector that addresses the underlying structural factors that contributed to
the crisis A supplementary budget and fiscal package for 2001 have been
introduced. We have also taken important steps to increase fiscal transparency
and intend to launch a comprehensive program of reforms to improve public
sector management. The public sector reform program aims to achieve
permanent fiscal adjustment and establish the foundation for transparent and
effective govemment. This will entail radical improvements in public policy
formulation, the framework for resource mobilization and altocation, the system of
public oversight and accountability, and public sector governance. This is an
agenda for modernizing the Turkish public sector to meet the challenges of the
new century.
33.  The Govemment's public sector reform program has three pillars. The first
involves structural fiscal policies to underpin the near-term fiscal adjustment and
then to ensure that this adjustment becomes permanent The Government
intends to adopt a mediumterm strategy for improving the tax system by
15



December 2001 and a comprehensive program to adjust staffing levels in the
central government and SEEs is envisaged. The second pillar comprises
institutional and policy reforms to improve public expenditure management
(PEM). The Government has prepared a multi-year Strategic Framework for
Public Expenditure Management Reform    which is in line with the
recommendations of the Public Expenditure and Institutional Review (PEIR)
carried out jointly with the World Bank. The strategic framework is annexed to
this letter. The third pillar involves broad based institutional reforms to improve
the quality of public sector goveemance. This includes on-going regulatory
reforms in the banking, energy and telecommunications sectors, a systematic
approach to combating corruption and - over medium term - civil service reform.
The Government is preparmng a natonal strategy for improving govemance and
combating corruption which it expects to adopt by December 2001. To help
further develop its public sector reform program, the Govemment plans to host
two international conferences on Effective Govemment in collaboration with the
Bank. The first, scheduled for September, will focus on anti-corruption. The
second conference, scheduled for November 2001, will focus on public
management reforms linked to the PEM agenda.
34.  We request the support of the World Bank in carrying out our public sector
reform program. The agenda for the remainder of 2001 would be supported by
the PFPSAL program. The public sector reform actions to be taken prior to
Board presentation of the first PFPSAL operation are detailed below together
with the implementation benchmarks expected to be completed by December
2001 for the second PFPSAL operation. These prior actions and implementation
-benchmarks will ensure that the core framework for the public sector reform
program is in place by the end of 2001, together with the urgent measures
required to achieve the revised 2001 fiscal targets agreed with the IMF. The
second phase of the public sector reform program will be undertaken during
2002-03 in synchronization with the annual budget cycle. During this period, we
intend to complete the main policy and legal reforms underpinning the program
and set in motion the key longer-term institutional reforrns required to ensure its
sustainability and to realize the full benefits. We would request the Bank to
support these conUinued efforts through the first programmatic public sector
adjustment loan (PPSAL) envisaged for late 2002 in the revised CAS high case-
35.  The specifics of the Govemments proposed public sector reforms are
presented below under three major headings; namely (i) Structural Fiscal
Policies, (ii) Public Expenditure Management Reform, and (iii) Public Sector
Govemance.
Structural Fiscal Policies
16



36.  The Government is implementing tough fiscal measures to support the
supplementary budget for 2001. These measures supplement the orginal fiscal
package for the 2001 budget approved in December 2000. The original package
included important revenue measures including extension through 2002 of
several temporary taxes, renewal of quarterly advance income tax payments,
increases in motor vehicle taxes, and the re-introduction of presumptive income
taxation based on living standards.  The supplementary fiscal package
incorporates the following measures:
. Increase in the petroleum consumption tax (PCT) by at least 15 percent in
May, following a 20 percent increase in April, and subsequent full
implementation of the indexation regulation for the PCT adopted in 2000;
* Increase in the standard VAT rate from 17 to 18 percent and the luxury rate
from 25 to 26 percent;
* Increase in the minimum base for social security contrbutions of 40 percent
and increase in the ceiling from 4 to 5 times the minimum base in line with
existing regulations;
. Full pass through by SEEs of cost increases due to exchange rate
adjustments and the revised inflation targets; and
3 Adjustment of agriculture support prices in line with the agriculture reform
program supported by the ERL.
37.  Looking past the immediate crisis, further fundamental fiscal reforms will
be required on both the revenue and expenditure sides to reach the 6.5 percent
of GNP primary surplus for the consolidated public sector targeted for 2002 and
to sustain this adjustment over the medium term. These reforms will complete
and build on the results achieved under the ERL program in the areas of social
security reform, energy reform, and reform of agriculture support policies.
38. The Government's medium-term strategy for improving the tax system in
Turkey will cover tax administration, personal income tax, corporate income tax
and the indirect tax system. The overall objective is to improve the stability,
transparency and equity of the tax system, but without a major increase in the
overall tax burden for existing taxpayers who comply with the system, Improving
tax administration is a priority including automaion, transparency, compliance,
taxpayer services and tax audit. In June 2001, the Government will enact a tax
regulation expanding the use of Tax tdentification Numbers (TINs) to owners of
bank accounts, users of banking services and participants in financial
transacfions. As part of the medium-term strategy, the MOF is preparing
provisions to facilitate mergers and acquisitions in the corporate sector as the
economy recovers from the crisis, as well as a special consumption tax to
replace the existing system of specific excise taxes. The Government intends to
17



adopt the medium-term strategy for improving the tax system by December 2001.
The strategy will be implemented during 2002-03,
39.  On the expenditure side, the Government recognizes that strong action is
needed to adjust staffing levels throughout the central government and SEEs to a
level consistent with medium-term resource constraints and fiscal targets. The
Government has decided that the number of civil servants will not increase in
2001 and that it will strictly implement the existing policy of replacing up to a
maximum of 15 percent of retiring personnel in the SEEs including Turk Telekom
and the enterprises in the portfolio of the Privatization Administration.  By
December 2001, the Government intends to initiate a comprehensive program to
right size the public sector based in part on extension of the norm cadre system
and a functional review of govemment. The program will include sustained
implementation of the privatization program and specific targets for staffing in the
central government for end-2002 and end-2003. As part of the program, the
Govemment will consider expanding the use of early retirement incentives such
as those included in the telecommunications amendments enacted in May. This
program will be prepared and implemented in coordination with the ministerial
committee for civil service reform which the Government plans to establish.
Public Expenditure Manatement
40.  The Government has adopted a multi-year strategy for reforming public
expenditure management and has established a high-level Steering Committee
to coordinate implementation including representatives of MOF, Treasury, SPO,
and TCA. The Steering Committee will be expanded to include line ministres
and agencies. The strategy encompasses: (i) reform of the processes for budget
preparation and execution to ensure transparency and aggregate fiscal
discipline, institutional measures to build capacity for policy formulation to guide
resource allocation, and concrete steps to improve operational performance of
line ministries and agencies; (ii) upgrade of public accounting, procurement and
audit functions to ensure adequate financial accountability in line with
internatonal standards; and (iii) legal measures and institution building to ensure
prudent public liability management.
41.  Budget Reform. The Govemment is taking steps to improve budget
management which will serve as the basis for a broader effort over the medium
term. For the 2002 budget, the following actions are being taken:
* Budgetary and Extra-budgetary Funds. Progress has been made under the
ERL program to expand the scope of the budget by reducing the number of
budgetary and extra-budgetary funds. In June 2001, the Parliament is
expected to adopt legislation to close 15 more budgetary funds and two EBFs.
18



As a resuKt, all budgetary funds, with the exception of the Support Price
Stabilization Fund linked to the reform of the agriculture sales cooperative
unions (ASCUs) under the ERL, and alt but five EBFs wlll be eliminated in the
2002 budget. The Government is committed not to create new budgetary or
extra-budgetary funds.
Revolving Funds. The Government plans to consolidate the revolving funds
by agency which is expected to result in a reduction in the number of
revolving funds by half by the end of 2001. These funds include about 2,650
special accounts or institutions recording expenditures against revenues from
the sale of public services amounting to some one percent of GNP.
Subsequendy, a comprehensive financial and economic review of the
operations of the revolving funds will be carried out and further steps will be
identified by mid 2002 to facilitate their incorporation into the general
government budget presentation.  In carrying out this exercise, the
Government will pay close attention to the importance of maintaining the
access of institutions at the local level to revolving fund revenues. Revolving
fund revenues will be reported as "own source  revenues of general
govemment agencies in an annex to the 2002 budget presented to
Parliament.
* Foundations.  A task force from the relevant govemment units will be
established in 2001 to review the role and appropriate treatment of
foundations and associations within the overall public sector.
V Budget Classification.  A budget classification for consolidated budget
agencies in line with the new GFS standards (including full functional
classification) has been completed and will be implemented on a pilot basis in
2002. The draft budget submitted to Parliament for 2002 will be accompanied
by the accounts and financial outlook for: (i) contingent liabilities of the
Treasury, (ii) other general govremment agencies including EBFs, social
security institutions, revolving funds, autonomous agencies, and local
authorities; and (iii) the SEEs.
* Public Investment Proqram. The Govemment intends to rationalize the public
investment program  (PIP) in the 2002 budget.  As part of the PIP
rationalization, the Government intends to carry out a Public Investment
Review on an urgent basis and has requested support for this review from the
Bank.
42. The High Planning Council will issue in June a decision for the 2002
budget preparation process to accompany the Prime Minister's Budget Call. The
decision will: (i) provide a macro-fiscal framework for 2002 budget preparation
including overall levels for the recurrent and investment budget, (ii) establish
indicative ceilings for both the recurrent and investment budgets for ministries
and line agencies, (iii) freeze the introduction of new multi-year projects into the
19



PIP, except for possible emergency projects, and (iv) call for a rationalization of
the PIP in the 2002 budget. The decision will include:
* timetable for rationalization process,
* objective of reducing expected average time to completion of the overall PIP
by 20% in 2002 compared to the 2001 PIP along with sector-specific
reductions consistent with this overall objective,
* global criteria for prioritizing projects, and
* instruction to ministries and line agencies to prioritize their investment
programs in line with the ceilings, objectives and criteria.
43. Sustained implementation of the budget reform wnill be linked to the annual
budget cycles for 2002-03. The following actons are planned:
* Budget Classification. The remaining preparatory actions, including legal
changes, required to implement the new budget classification and coding on a
pilot basis in the 2002 budget will be completed by December 2001, and the
budget classification will be extended to cover all of general govemment as
defined by the new GFS. Rollout of the new budget classification for the
consolidated budget agencies will begin with the 2003 budget cycle. The new
GFS budget classification is expected to be fully operafional for the entre
general government in the 2004 budget.
* Bud-et Pre2aration. The Govemment will ensure effective implementation of
the 2002 budget preparation process in line with the Prme Minister's Budget
Call. An enhanced preparation process will be implemented for the 2003
budget-including introduction of a rolling two-year expenditure framework.
The Government intends that the Prime Ministers Budget Call for in the 2003
budget will include individually specified indicative ceilings for each ministry
and line agency based on the experience with the 2002 budget preparation
process.
a Public Investment Program. The Govemment will adopt a PIP for 2002 which
is consistent with the rationalization objectives set out in the High Planning
Council Decision, together with an action plan for sustaining a rational PIP
beyond 2002.
. Building Ca2acitv for Policy Formulation. The Govemment will undertake
actions by December 2001 to introduce new elements of policy formulation
into the budget process. The SPO will prepare by December 2001 guidelines
for strategic planning by key line ministries and departments including
guidelines for costng policies.  Policy reviews will be initiated by line
ministries and agencies to derive clear statement of objectives and
expenditure priorities in preparation of 2002 budget. The role of ministerial
departments responsible for policy reviews will be revived with support of
SPO. Dunng 2002, the Govemment will undertake further efforts to build
20



capacity for policy formulation in the line ministries and agencies with support
from SPO.
rmprovinp Ooerational Performance. The Government intends to identify by
December 2001 a group of line ministries and agencies willing to volunteer for
a pilot reform program that wilt provide them with greater discretionary control
over inputs linked to implementation of effective internal controls and
commitment to improved performance. For agencies in the pilot program that
satisfy the requirements of satisfactory intemal control systems, the 2002
budget will provide appropriate levels of appropriations linked to areas of
agreed performance in 'block' form, allowing agency discretonary authority
for management of resources. During 2002, the pilot program to improve
operational performance will be implemented. Expansion of the prograrn to
improve operational performance will begin with the 2003 budget cycle.
44. FInancial Accountability. Accounting. Action to upgrade the public
accounting system is already underway. Field installations for the say2000i
system will be substantially completed by the end of June with the objective of
starting full automation for consolidated budget agencies by end-2001. Full
automation under the say2000i system will start in December 2001. Going
forward, the Government will take necessary actions to adapt the accounting
system to the new GFS classification for the budget and to introduce accrual
accounting. By December 2001, the Govemment intends to: (i) revise the
Accounting Law (No- 1050) to incorporate the new definition of general
govremment and atlow MOF to issue accounting standards for all general
government agencies in line with the new GFS classification, (ii) issue new
modified accrual based chart of accounts consistent with GFS for general
government, and (iii) develop a strategy for phased introduction of accrual
accounting across general govemment agencies.
45.  Procurement.  The Govemment intends to upgrade Turkey's public
procurement legislation and procedures in line with intemational standards. A
new public procurement law is under preparation that vill be consistent with
UNCITRAL standards as part of a medium-term strategy to meet full compliance
with EU directives. The Govemment expects the new public procurement law to
be enacted before the end of 2001. The law is expected to: (i) cover all goods,
works, and services, (ii) be applicable to all central and local govemment
agencies; and (iii) encompass both budgetary and non-budgetary procurement.
The law will also cover non-commercialized SEEs. The Government will initiate
preparation of a system by December 2001 to define quatified contractors in line
with new law. During 2002, the Government will implement the new legislation
and undertake efforts to strengthen institutional capacity. Steps will also be
taken to prepare for the introduction of perfodic procurement audits by TCA and
publication of the results.
21



46.  Auditing, The Govemment has established  a task force to develop a
reform program for the public audit system. The objectives of the program are
two fold. First, develop a plan of action, including necessary legal amendments,
to expand scope of TCA audits to cover the entire general government including
autonomous agencies, social security institutions, remaining EBFs, and revolving
funds. Second, prepare a new law on internal financial control and audit in line
with international standards based on a review of current control, inspection and
audit processes. This new legislation will promote improvements in control and
audit quality in line with international standards and support the shift from ex ante
controls to ex post monitoring in harmony with the efforts to improve operational
performance of budget agencies. By December 2001, the Government intends
to adopt a plan of action to expand scope of TCA audits and MOF will circulate to
ministries and line agencies a discussion draft of the new law on intemal financial
control and audit with objective of submitting it to Parliament by mid 2002. In
addition, by December, TCA will include all consolidated budget agencies under
its annual audit as required by the Constfitution, including the Presidency,
Parliament and TCA. TCA's own accounts will be subject to audit with reports
submitted to the Parliament. In line with new law on internal financial control,
TCA's involvement in budget execution under the pre-audit system will be
discontinued, starting in 2002, and TCA will initiate a shift to ,erformance audits.
47.  Public Liability Management The Government recognizes that role of
the buildup of quasi-fiscal and contingent liabilities in the state banks in triggering
the November and February crises highlights the importance of strengthening
public liability management in Turkey- Regulatory reforms in the electricity sector
supported by the ERL are addressing one of the main sources of contingent
liabilities in the form of government guaranteed BOT contracts. State bank
reform and other actions under the financial sector reform program are
addressing another major source of contingent liabilities. In May, a Govemment
decree was published and the Parliament is expected to adopt legislation in
June which together will eliminate all existing legal provisions authornzing
creation of duty losses in the state banks. This action aligns the legal framework
with the state banks restructuring law approved in December 2000.
48.  The Govemment intends to establish a comprehensive risk management
framework as the foundation for future management of public liabilities. The
Govemment will submit to Padiament in June a law on public debt management
that establishes Treasury as the single borrowing authority for the central
govemment. This law, which the Government expects to be enacted before the
end of 2001, will serve as the legal basis forthe risk management framework on
which work has been initiated. By December 2001, the Govemment will conduct
a review of its guarantee portfolio and prepare a debt sustainability analysis
including all identifiable contingent liabilities of the central government. Over the
22



course of 2002, as eiements of the risk management framework, the Govemment
intends to: (i) develop guidelines for the issuance of government guarantees and
for borrowing by state enterprises, (ii) implement mechanisms for monitoring
government project guarantees and on-lending operations, and develop a
centralized fiscal risk analysis capability; and (iii) prepare and disclose a
Government Fiscal Risk Statement. The full institutional structure for the new
public liability management system, including all necessary legal changes,
should be in place by 2003, and the Govemment will then be in a position to
issue its public liability strategy as an annex to the future medium-term
expenditure framework.
Public Sector Governance
49.  Regulatory reforms are a key element of the Government's program for
improving public sector governance.  Major progress has been made in
improving the quality of the regulatory environment in Turkey, under the ERL
program in energy and telecommunications and the FSAL program in the
financial sector. Recently enacted legislation for electricty (February 2001) and
gas (May 2001) has established a unified independent regulator for the energy
sector. In telecommunications, legislation enacted in January 2000 created an
independent regulatory authority and amendments enacted in May 2001
transferred all licensing authority to this authority. Successive amendments to
the banking law have strengthened the Banking Regulatory and Supervision
Agency as described earlier.
50.  The Govemment has initiated preparation of a national strategy to improve
govemance and combat corruption which will extend beyond the on-going
regulatory reforms.  A steering committee has been formed consisting of
representatives from the Treasury, the Prime Ministers Inspection Board, the
Anti-Money Launderng Unit of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Justice and
the Ministry of Interior. The objective is to develop a comprehensive approach to
the issue which establishes clear priorites and benchmarks, and empowers and
energizes public opinion to fight corruption. The Government is counting on the
active involvement of national NGOs. To help formulate the strategy, the
Government plans to host an intemational conference on good governance and
anti-corruption in collaboration with the Bank in September 2001. The steering
committee expects to complete preparation of the strategy by end-September
and its adoption and publicaion by the Government is planned before the end of
2001. The strategy will encompass specific actions reJated to improving the
transparency of the tax system and public expenditure management. It is
expected to include concrete performance benchmarks for the ministries and
line agencies. In a related action, the Government submitted to Parliament in
early June legislation to improve the code of conduct of public officials.
23



bZ d fliiOi
51.  The medium-term govemance agenda encompasses civil service reform
which is vital to ensuring the quality of public services. The Government plans to
establish a ministerial committee in 2001 to carry out a functonal review of
government in preparation for the civil service reform. On the basis of this
review, the Government will present its strategy for civil service reform to the
public in 2002.
52. The Government of Turkey believes that the policies and measures
described above are adequate to achieve the objectives of our financial and
public sector reform prram for which support from the World Bank is
requested. The Govremment is committed to meeting all of the benchmarks and
triggers agreed with the Bank for the PFPSAL If and for follow up programmatic
loans in the financial and public sectors. The Govemment also stands ready to
take additional measures, if necessary to achieve the success of our program, in
regular consultation with the World Bank.

Project Objectives
The main objective of the proposed PFPSAL is to address the Government's immediate financial and
public sector reform priorities in the aftermath of the November 2000 and February 2001 financial
crises, while ensuring that social programs continue to be adequately funded. Key priorities include, in
the financial sector: (i) overhaul of the regulatory framework for banking activity, (ii) institutional
development of the new Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), (iii) problem bank/bank
failure resolution, and (iv) state bank restructuring and privatization; and in the public sector: (a)
structural fiscal policies, (b) public expenditure management, (c) financial accountability, (d) public
liability management, and (e) public sector governance. The PFPSAL will provide budgetary support to
help the Government finance the costs arising from the crisis while continuing to fund its critical social
programs.
Project Description
The proposed Programmatic Financial and Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL) is the first Loan in
support of the Government's multi-year financial and public sector reform program. It is envisaged that
the proposed PFPSAL will be followed by a second Programmatic Financial and Public Sector
Adjustment Loan (PFPSAL II) of US$1.35 billion (US$550 million on standard IBRD terms and US$800
million on SSAL terms-tentatively planned for December 2001), as well as by (i) two Programmatic
Financial Sector Adjustment Loans (PFSAL I and 11) of US$500 million each, and (ii) a Programmatic
Public Sector Adjustment Loan (PPSAL) of US$375 million. The latter two sets of adjustment loans will
all on standard IBRD terms and are tentatively planned for June 2002 (PFSAL I), December 2002
(PPSAL) and June 2003 (PFSAL II), to support the implementation of the program. The main objective
of the proposed PFPSAL is to address the Government's immediate financial and public sector reform
priorities in the aftermath of the November 2000 and February 2001 banking system and macro-
economic crises, including, in the financial sector: (i) overhaul of the regulatory framework for banking
activity; (ii) institutional development of the new Bank Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA); (iii)
problem bank/bank failure resolution; and (iv) state bank restructuring and privatization; and in the
public sector: (i) structural fiscal policies; (ii) public expenditure management; (iii) financial
accountability; (iv) public liability management; and (v) public sector governance.
