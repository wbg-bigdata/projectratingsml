Description        This is the second policy loan (PL2) in a program o f three lending operations
                   supporting a policy program aimed at accelerating Poland's convergence with
                   average EU living standards. PL2 will continue to support reform o f public
                   financial management, the business environment, and improvements o f labor
                   market efficiency in line with the first loan, as well as structural improvements
                   to the finance and provision o f health, education and social protection services.
                   The second lending operation inthe program has the following objectives: (i)      to
                   support structural reforms that will ensure fiscal consolidation over the medium
                   term; (ii) to protect priority investment programs and the up-front fiscal costs of
                   structural reforms critical to meeting Poland's goals o f convergence with the
                   rest o f the EU; and (iii)to mitigate the social cost o f the economic crisis. Inthe
                   months since the first policy loan in the program was disbursed, the external
                   economic environment has changed dramatically, causing growth in Poland to
                   slow sharply. To better manage the uncertainty that the world economic crisis
                   has introduced into Poland's outlook and fiscal targets, while pushing ahead
                   with the reform o f public financial management and improvements in the
                   business environment, the Government is now focusing on elements o f the
                   program specifically targeting the labor market, education, health and social
                   protection. Consequently, PL2 continues to support reforms initiated with the
                   first loan, and expands its focus to structural improvements and maintaining
                   critical programs inthe social sectors.
                   The Government has met all o f the agreed prior actions for the second loan.
                   These are : (i) satisfactory continued implementation o f the 2009 budget in light
                   o f the changed economic outlook including consideration o f the assessments by
                   the European Union and the IMF; (ii)submission to Parliament o f an amended
                   Law on Public Finance satisfactory to the Bank; (iii)    amendments to the Law on
                   Freedom o f Business Operations that unify and coordinate business inspection
                   procedures, scheduling and duration among all inspection authorities; (iv) offer
                   for sale (through stock exchange or by auction) or via competitive tenders the
                   first 80 public sector enterprises in the privatization program (or those
                   constituting 10 percent o f aggregate asset value); (v) implementation o f the
                   government program to increase labor force participation o f older workers,
                   known as "50+"; (vi) enactment o f the Law on Bridging Pensions that reduces
                   the number o f people eligible for early retirement from 1.7 million to 300,000,
                   while safeguarding the base level o f pensions for those affected by the change;
                   (vii) approval of an implementation plan for the participation o f public hospitals
                   inavoluntary program that would convert them into corporate entities operating
                   under the Commercial Code; (viii) adoption by the National Health Fund(NFZ)



                                              iv

                  o f a payment system based on diagnostically related groups (DRGs) for 90
                  percent o f all hospital services; (ix) passage o f a law to initiate a pre-primary
                  program for 5 year-old children (Grade 0), implemented initially on a voluntary
                  basis but on a mandatory basis beginning in 2012; and (x) provision for a
                  reserve in the 2009 budget to protect vulnerable households affected by the
                  economic downturn.
                  As a condition of effectiveness, the Government has agreed to initiate the
                  process o f revising its 2009 budget in form and substance consistent with the
                  measuresbeing supported by this Program.
Benefits          The actions supported by PL2 constitute substantive structural reforms that will
                  support fiscal consolidation over the mediumterm. Ina sharply slowing
                  economy, and as government revenues fall, PL2 will help to protect priority
                  programs andthe up-front fiscal costs o f structural reforms critical to meeting
                  Poland's goals o f convergence with the rest o f the EU. Furthermore, the
                  financial support provided by PL2 and accompanying AAA will helpthe
                  Government to mitigate the social cost o f the economic crisis.
R i S k S         There are three principal risks as the Government takes the next step in its
                  reform program in partnership with the World Bank. First, the medium-term
                  macroeconomic scenario o f slowing economic growth is subject to further
                  downside risks.     While the exogenous risk cannot be fully mitigated, as a
                  condition o f effectiveness, the Government has agreed to initiate the process o f
                  revising its 2009 budget consistent with the measures being supported by the
                  program.
                  Second, Poland's external and financial vulnerability may be further affected by
                  the risk o f contagion from other countries in the region, and access to external
                  financing sources may become more difficult and more expensive.
                  Third, the projecteddeteriorationo feconomic prospects may undermine support
                  for the Government and reduce its willingness to continue its structural reforms.
                  Reform momentum is already constrained by the risk o f Presidential veto on
                  new legislation passedinParliament, inparticular inthe area o f social services.
                  To mitigate this, the Bank can support the Polish Government with
                  communications about the necessity o f the reform measures proposed under this
                  program.

                                  I.INTRODUCTION

1.      This is the second policy loan (PL2) in the amount of EUR 1 billion
(US$1,300,240,000 equivalent) in a program of three lending operations supporting
a reform program aimed at accelerating Poland's convergence with average
EuropeanUnion(EU) livingstandards. Polandhas made impressive progress towards
creating a modern, market-based economy.          It has successfully acceded to the EU.
However, constraints to the country's continued rapid convergence with its EU partners
are becoming visible. Key challenges identifiedby the Government and the Bank, which
this program is designedto address, are: supporting structural budget and public sector
management reforms to ensure fiscal consolidation and reduction o f the government's
deficit to levels consistent with its obligations under the EU's Stability and Growth Pact,
increasing the supply and skills o f the labor force, and strengthening the business
environment.     PL2 includes, as an elaboration o f the public financial management,
private sector development, and skills agendas, a more complete treatment of reforms in
social sector spending that will contribute to efficient, equitable, and effective
investments inthe Polish population through education and health programs, as well as a
more robust safety net for the vulnerable that is consistent with labor market policies. In
parallel with this series o f policy loans, the Bank has undertaken a Public Expenditure
Review (PER) that focuses on the same sectors as the loans. It will be discussed with the
government in mid-2009. It provides the analytical underpinnings o f this loan and i s
intendedto assist the government informulating further structural reforms insocial sector
spendingthat will affect budgets in2010 andbeyond.

2.      The first loan in the program (PL1) supported policy actions to strengthen
public financial management, increase participation in the labor market, and
improvethe environmentfor doingbusiness. Consistent with the convergence aims o f
the program, the policy actions takenby the Government prior to presentation o fthe first
loan to the Board in December 2008, included: satisfactory implementation o f the 2008
budgetandpresentation o fthe 2009 budgetbillconsistent with the Convergence Program
and personal income tax (PIT); a reduction in payroll taxes to reduce the tax wedge on
labor; elimination of work permits for foreign workers from neighboring countries to
increase labor supply; tightening eligibility requirements for disability benefits;
presentation o f legislation to Parliament that reduces the minimum capital required to
start a business; andthe approval o f a privatizationprogram encompassing the sale o f 740
state owned enterprises.

3.       This operation, the second loan in the series (PLZ), will continue to support
reforms in public financial management, the business environment, and
improvements of labor market efficiency in line with the first loan, as well as
structuralimprovementsto the financeandprovisionof health, educationand social
protection services. The second lending operation in the program has the following
objectives: (i) to support structural reforms that will ensure fiscal consolidation over the
mediumterm; (ii) protect priority investment programs andthe up-front fiscal costs of
                    to
structural reforms critical to meeting Poland's goals of convergence with the rest o f the
EU; and (iii) mitigate the social cost of the economic crisis. Inthe months since the
               to
first loan in the program was disbursed, the external economic environment has changed
dramatically, causing growth in Poland to slow sharply.            To better manage the
uncertainty that the world economic crisis has introduced to Poland's outlook and fiscal
targets, while pushing ahead with reform of public financial management and
improvements inthe business environment, the Government is now focusing on the part
of the program specifically targeting the labor market, education, health and social
protection. The second lending operation in the program (PL2) continues to support
reforms initiated with the first loan and expands the focus to include structural
improvements in, andthe maintenance of, criticalprograms inthe social sectors.

4.       Government has met all of the agreed prior actions for the second loan (as
reported in Section V). These are: (i)   satisfactory continued implementation of the 2009
budget in light of the changed economic outlook, including consideration o f the
assessments by the European Union and the IMF; (ii)submission to Parliament o f the
amendedLaw onPublic Finance satisfactory to the Bank; (iii)      amendmentsto the Law on
Freedom of Business Operations that unify, and coordinate business inspection
procedures, scheduling and duration among all inspection authorities; (iv) offer for sale
(through stock exchange or by auction) or via competitive tenders the first 80 public
sector enterprises in the privatization program (or those constituting 10 percent of
aggregate asset value); (v) implementation o f the government program to increase labor
force participation of older workers, known as "50+"; (vi) enactment o f the Law on
Bridging Pensions that reduces the number o f people eligible for early retirement from
1.7 million to 300,000, while safeguarding the base level of pensions for those affected
by the change; (vii) approval of an implementation plan for the participation of public
hospitals ina voluntary program that would convert them into corporate entities operating
under the Commercial Code; (viii) adoption by the National Health Fund (NFZ) of a
payment system based on diagnostically related groups (DRGs) for 90 percent o f all
hospital services; (ix) passage of a law to initiate a pre-primary program for 5 year-old
children(Grade 0), implementedinitially on a voluntary basis but on a mandatory basis
beginning in 2012; and (x) provision for a reserve in the 2009 budget to protect
vulnerable households affected by the economic downturn.            Poland and the world
continue to cope with extraordinary economic conditions, and risks of hrther
deterioration remain high. As a condition o f effectiveness, the Government has agreedto
initiate the process of revising its 2009 budget in form and substance consistent with the
measures being supported by this program, a measure that highlights its continued
commitment to the first prior action of this loaninthe uncertain economic environment.

2.1. RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTSINPOLAND

5.      Poland has successfully managed its integrationinto the EU since accession
in 2004. The EU and its institutions are now Poland's main external partners, to which
the World Bank is committed to play a supporting role. Poland also has access to
considerable external financing, including EU Structural and Cohesion Funds on a grant
basis.'

6.      The Government has political room to continue pursuing a substantial
reform agenda with the objective of convergence with EU partners, although
upcomingelections will increasepoliticaldebate around reforms. The Government,
created by the Civic Platform and the Polish Peasant's Party and led by Prime Minister
Donald Tusk, operates without any major political tensions and enjoys strong social
support. However, the Government's lack o f a qualified majority in Parliament poses
obstacles to its reform program that are likely to grow over the coming months as
Presidential elections in the Fall 2010 approach. Controversial reform measures are at
risk o f veto by the President Lech Kaczynski of the opposition Law and Justice (Pis)
party, as has been demonstrated on several recent occasions. In some cases, such as the
tightening of early retirement conditions, the Government was able to overcome the
Presidential veto with support from other parties. Elections to the European Parliament
and Sub-National Governments scheduled for June 2009 are expected to generate heated
political debate.

7.      Polandhas thus far avoided the direct impacts of the financialcrisis, and its
vulnerability remains moderate, but the country is                         being affected by the
deterioration in the external economic environment. Among the EU new member
states, Poland i s in better fiscal and financial shape but i s affected by the ongoing crisis
through declining demand for Polish exports, a slowdown o f credit activity, and lower
FDIinflows. Polandis less reliant on external demand than other, more open countries in
the region and will be relatively less affected by a recession in the Euro area. At the
onset o f the crisis, the Polish economy was in a strong position after five years o f rapid
growth and historically low unemployment. Inflation, the current account deficit, external
debt, the fiscal deficit, and public debt are moderate. The financial system remains
relatively sound. Nevertheless, the weakening o f the zloty inthe last quarter o f 2008 and
early 2009 and high volatility o f the exchange rate show that there i s little room for
complacency on the part ofthe authorities.

8.      Poland'sfinancialsystem is well poisedto cope with the increasinglyadverse
externalenvironment. While the banking systemis dominated by foreign banks whose
external fbndingconditions appear to have deteriorated - owing to problems of the parent
banks - some domestic banks of significant size operate in the sector as well, including a
large state-owned bank. Credit growth in Poland and the overall ratio o f credit-to-GDP

                                                    3

 has been moderate and much lower than in most o f the other countries in the region.
 Most o f the credit expansion has been financed through domestic deposits, although
 foreign financing has been playing an increasing role in recent years. A large share o f
 domestic investment has been financed through enterprise profits. While there are some
 concerns for foreign currency mortgage lending, the overall level o f this lending i s
 relatively small. The recent depreciation o f the zloty follows a period o f very strong
 appreciation in 2007 and 2008. Bank profits have reached record highs in recent years
 and banks remain well capitalized. However, credit conditions are likely to tighten
 significantly this year and some enterprises may find it difficult to roll over maturing
  short-term loans (which constitute about one-half o ftotal enterprise loans).

 9.       The rapid deteriorationof the external environment, especially in the Euro
 zone, and tightening of financial markets have slowed growth in Poland. In 2008,
 the Polish economy expanded by 4.8 percent, down from 6.7 percent growth in 2007, as
 year-on-year growth moderated from 5 percent in the third quarter to 2.9 percent in the
 fourth quarter. Weak global demand has undermined the supply response o f exports to
 the 25 percent depreciation o f the zloty relative to the Euro since the end o f September
 2008 so that the contribution o f net exports to growth i s likely to remain broadly neutral
 during 2009. With private investment declining, the 2009 growth outcome will hinge
 critically on private consumption. Overall, the Government's real growth projection o f
  1.7 percent compares to April projections o f 0.5 percent by the World Bank and -0.7
percent by the IMF. Inany case, forecasts are subject to an unusual degree o funcertainty
 inthe current environment.

  10.     Higherthan plannedgovernmentconsumptionandlower than assumed non-
tax revenues together with the slowdown in economic activity towards the end of
2008 contributed to an unexpected increase in the fiscal deficit. The 2008 general
 government fiscal deficit reached 3.9 percent o f GDP, some 1.2 percentage points higher
than projected by the Government in the December 2008 Convergence Program. This
was due to higher-than-expected deficits o f both local and central governments (due to
higher than planned expenditure and lower than expected revenue), while social security
 funds performed accordingto plan. Basedon the fiscal outcome for 2008, the EC opened
Excessive Deficit Procedures on May 13, 2009.2                     Excessive Deficit Procedures are


~~             ~            ~~




  The EC reported the following: "The general government deficit inPolandreached 3.9% o f GDP in
2008, above andnot close to the 3% reference value. The breach o f the threshold mainly reflects the fact
that good times were only to a certain extent used as an opportunity to consolidate public finances and
undertake deep reforms on the expenditure side. Poland's general government deficit over the past five
years averaged 4.3% of GDP, at the same time as GDP growth on average exceeded 5%. The Polish
authorities have revised their 2009 deficit target to 4.6% o f GDP which shows that the excess over the
reference value is not temporary. The Commission services' spring forecast projects the deficit to increase
to 6.6% this year and, under unchangedpolicies, to further widen in2010. The reduction insocial
contributions, an increase inpersonal income tax reliefs for families, and a generousindexation o fpensions
and social benefits increased the deficit in2008. Inaddition, higher-than-planned intermediate
consumption and investment, as well as a drop inrevenues at the end o f2008 due to the economic
slowdown, all resulted ina higher than expected deficit both at the central and local government level. The
excess over the reference value cannot be qualified as exceptional within the meaningof the Treaty and the
SGP nor can itbe considered temporary. This suggests that the deficit criterion inthe Treaty is not
fulfilled. General government gross debt remains below the 60% o f GDP reference value." The excessive


                                                        4

triggered when the deficit-to-GDP ratio exceeds 3 percent or debt-to-GDP ratio exceeds
60 percent and which requires countries to produce a plan for how this will be corrected.
The EC is expected to come to a conclusion inJuly 2009 on the existence o f an excessive
deficit. This would give Poland until January 2010 to take corrective actions. These
corrective actions would be presented in an updated Convergence Program expected in
December 2009.

11.       Inflation accelerated to 4.2 percent on average in 2008, from 2.5 percent in
2007, but the peak was reached in the first half of 2008 and inflation has eased
significantly since. With GDP growth expected to slow sharply in 2009 and world
commodity prices falling, expectations for inflation have eased and the National Bank o f
Poland (NBP) began reducing interest rates inlate 2008. Inflation i s projectedto return to
around the middleo f its target range o f 1.5 to 3.5 percent in2009.

12.       The balance of payments has come under some pressure but Poland's
external position remains strong. The current account deficit remained at around 5.5
percent o f GDP in 2008, but weaker capital inflows have been associated with a sharp
depreciation o f the zloty following strong appreciation inrecent years. Followinga hiatus
o f 7 months, the government returned to international capital markets with a Euro 1
billion issue inJanuary 2009 at a spread o f around 300 basis points above German Bunds.
In early May 2009, Poland successfully placed a EUR750 million issue at a spread o f
about 40 basis points below the January level. Poland's external debt o f about 56 percent
o f GDP i s moderate by regional standards, but gross financing needs are sizeable and
could add further strains on the balance o f payments. Inflows o f EU funds and FDI
should finance a major part o f the external gap. Poland's floating exchange rate regime i s
serving it well to help absorb the external shock.

13.       The Government approached the IMF for a USD 20.5 billion one-year
facility under the new Flexible Credit Line (FCL), which was approved in M a y
2009. The primary objective o f the Government's application i s to obtain the IMF's
"seal o f approval" on its macroeconomic policies, to strengthen market confidence and to
differentiate Poland from other regional economies.                 The IMF Board approved the
request inMay 2009. The financial market reacted positively to the news.

14.       After a remarkable improvement of labor market performance in recent
years, unemployment is expected to rise in 2009 on the back of the economic
slowdown. In recent years, Poland recorded an unprecedented improvement in labor
market performance. The unemployment rate measured by the labor force survey (LFS)
fell from over 20 percent in2004 to around 7 percent in2008. The data disaggregated by
gender indicate that unemployment among women remains higher than among men but
also decreased considerably, from 19 percent in 2004 to around 8 percent in 2008.

France, Spain, Ireland, Greece, UK and Hungary is already inprogress. Source: IP/O9/752,Brussels, 13

Unemployment i s expected to rise back into the double digits as the economy slows
sharply. InJanuary 2009, the inflow to unemployment was a quarter higher than a year
earlier, and the number o f the newly registered unemployed due to layoffs was twice as
high. The registeredunemployment rate reached 11.2 percent inMarch2009.

15.     The decline in unemploymentfrom 2004 to 2007 was accompaniedby lower
poverty rates. Relative poverty levels (measured using the Eurostat Laeken "at risk of
poverty" statistic) have decreased. Poverty i s concentrated in rural areas, among the
long-term unemployed, and households with many children (see Figure 1). Nonetheless,
despite vibrant growth o f real GDP and domestic consumption, Poland still has a
relatively high poverty rate compared to other countries in the region, especially among
children. Absolute poverty levels are considerably lower although measurement depends
on the choice o f poverty line. When measured as the percentage o f population below the
social assistanceeligibility income threshold, poverty dropped from 19 percent in2004 to
14.6 percent in 2007. The poverty gap also narrowed, meaning that the incomes o f the
poor moved closer to those o f the non-poor. The main determinants o f absolute poverty
in Poland include: rural residence, low educational attainment o f a household head,
unemployment o f a household member, and a higher number o f children in the
household.

Growth is now projected to recover slowly from 0.5 percent in 2009 to 1.0 percent in
2010, provided the external environment improves. Inflation i s expected to remain stable

households with income below 60 percent of the national median disposable income after transfers.

    lead to a significant moderation o f imports and an improvement in the external current
    account deficit (around 4 percent o f GDP in 2009-2010). Table 1 shows recent

    17.       The global financial crisis has worsened Poland's macroeconomic and fiscal
    outlook, even though it is faring better than other countries in the region. With
    limited resources in a fast evolving economic environment, the Government faces the
    difficult challenge o f reconciling three objectives: to ensure fiscal consolidation over the
   medium term; to protect priority programs for economic and social development so that
    growth prospects are enhanced; and to mitigate the potential social cost o f the economic
    crisis.

    18.       The Government took precautionary steps in January and February to
    ensure adherence to the state budget deficit target for 2009, but additional steps will
   be required. In late January 2009, the Government revised downwards the 2009 real
   GDP growth forecast from 3.7 percent, as estimated inthe December 2008 Convergence
   Program, to 1.7 percent.              To compensate for the expected shortfall in revenue, line
   ministries were asked to prepare plans for reducing state budget expenditures. Certain
   expenditure items, such as pension and disability payments, capitation grants to local
   governments for primary and secondary education, public sector wages, debt servicing,
   and co-financing for the absorption o f EUfunds, were protected from these reductions. In
   addition, the Government shiftedtransport infrastructure spending o f 0.8 percent o f GDP
   off the state budget to the National Road Fund. While this measure reduces the state
   budgetdeficit, itleaves the general government deficit unchanged.


                                                          7

      19.      During the second review of the 2009 budget implementationplanned for
      June 2009, the Government expects to decide on the adoption of a supplementary
      budget,which could include a combination of additional expenditure rationalization and
      an increase in the state budget deficit target. In the Government's latest projection, the
      general government fiscal deficit could reach 4.6 percent of GDP in 2009. The EC's
      springforecast shows a fiscal deficit of 6.6 percent ofGDP.

      20.      In the recent update of the Euro adoption roadmap, the Government
      reiterated its commitment to adopt the Euro in 2012. However, it abandoned plans
      for entry to European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM2) inmid-2009 due to exchange
      rate volatility, lack ofpoliticalconsensus on the requiredconstitutional changes andweak
      fiscal performance. Furthermore, Euro adoption in 2012 would require the Government
      to reduce the general government fiscal deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2010. A
      slow economic recovery would make it difficult to achieve the required fiscal
      consolidation. In line with the recent EC forecast, the headline fiscal deficit is to
      deteriorate further to 7.3 percent of GDP in 2010 under the assumption o f no additional
      policy changes.

      21.      The 2010 budget will be critical for the Euro adoption agenda and should
      envisage firm commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation. This commitment
      should be institutionally strengthenedby rapid passage of the amendment to the Public
      Finance Law aimed at consolidating budgetary units, strengthening precautionary debt


                                                                 8

rules, increasing performance orientation in the budget, and strengthening the medium-
term fiscal framework. In particular, introduction o f elements o f a Medium Term
Expenditure Framework (MTEF) should enhance the credibility o f the gradual fiscal
consolidation path from 2010, facilitate a permanent reduction of the structural fiscal
deficit, and stabilize the public debt-to-GDP ratio.

22.     Poland's economic and fiscal outlook remains subject to unusually large
uncertaintyinview of the unclearprospectsfor globaleconomic recovery. While the
forceful policy responses in many countries have contained the risks o f a systemic
financial meltdown, there are reasons to remain concerned about the potential impact on
activity o f the financial crisis. The process of deleveraging could be more protractedthan
has beenfactored into the macroeconomic projections for emerging markets. Another risk
relates to the growing risks o f deflationary conditions inadvanced economies.

2.3. SOCIALIMPACT OFTHE SLOWDOWNAND THE GOVERNMENT'S
PLANS

23.      So far the impact of the crisis on labor market conditions - and by
implicationon poverty-has been moderate. Layoffs have occurred largely inexport-
oriented industries and inconstruction. The most vulnerable groups - those that face the
highest risk o f unemployment if the crisis deepens - include less skilled workers in
manufacturing and construction.         In contrast, households that depend primarily on
subsistence agriculture - among whom the rate o f poverty i s highest- are to some extent
insulated from the impact o f the crisis, at least temporarily.

24.     The primary transmissionchannel of the economic slowdown is through the
labor market. It is therefore critical that Poland's social protection system be able to
respond effectively to increasing unemployment and vulnerability. Labor market programs
-bothpassive(unemployment benefits) andactive(public works, employment subsidies,
and training) are financed from the Labor Fund. The Fundi s financed from a 2.45 percent
payroll tax.

25.     Thanks to low unemployment in recent years, the Labor Fund has
accumulateda large surplus that will be the main source of contingentresources to
address the impact of the crisis. In2008, the revenues of the Labor Fundaccounted for
0.7 percent o f GDP, and the surplus o f the Fund represented close to 60 percent o f
expenditures. This has generated a substantial reserve with which to respond to growing
unemployment using a combination o f both passive and active measures.                  The
Government i s confident that sufficient resources are available to address the potential
surge inunemployment and provide the unemployed with income support andjob search
assistance. Local labor offices can also organize public works to provide temporary
employment opportunities should these become necessary.

26.     Using the Labor Fund proactively, the Government is putting in place
measures to increasethe adaptability of the labor market to the downturn, with the
support of labor unions and employers. In the context o f the program, and with the
agreement o f social partners, measures are planned that will help workers smooth hours

  and increase flexibility during an economic downturn.                           Further, labor unions and
  employers are coming to an agreement that would allow employers to reduce wages
  temporarily as an alternative to employment adjustment that would be applied selectively
  during the crisis. The Government plans to complement this agreement by financing a
  subsidy to workers whose wages are reduced o f up to 50 percent o f the minimumwage,
  financed from the Labor Fund. These measures are expected to reduce pressure for higher
  unemployment by providing more flexibility to adjust hours. As o f the negotiation o f
  PL2, the Government does not plan to introduce additional large scale public works,
  although this remains an option for local governments, and finding has been prioritized to
  protect EU-funded infrastructureprojects. Concerns remain for the part o f the labor force
  working informally and not covered with rights to unemployment protection.

  27.         The ability of Poland's targeted social assistance programs for the poorest
  households to respond quickly is more limited, but the Government is deploying
  better targeted resources to vulnerable parts of the country. Means tested social
  assistance in Poland is comprehensive and relatively well targeted when compared to
  means tested programs inother countries inCentral Europe (see Box l),                         although leakage
  o f targeted benefits to non-poor and otherwise ineligible groups remains a challenge.
   Social assistance programs are financed from general revenues, and by law are adjusted
  every three years to take into account o f changes inthe cost o f living. As shown inTable
  3, about a third o f households receive pension benefits. Both pensions and labor market
  programs are fairly evenly distributed across deciles, except they reach somewhat fewer
  households among the richest 20 percent. Social assistance benefits reach almost half o f
  households, but they are concentrated within the lower half o f the distribution. Table 4
  shows the percentage o f transfers reaching each decile. Except for pensions, which are
  related to earnings and are therefore skewed to the richest, Table 4 shows a somewhat
  stronger pattern o f targeting o f expenditures than might be expected from Table 3.

 28.          As the downturn becomes more severe, Government anticipates the need to
 use budget resources for social assistance and emergency interventions more
 efficiently. General revenues are declining as the tax base shrinks, lowering tax receipts.
 At this juncture, no additional emergency assistance programs are being considered.
 However, the Government is preparing for increased household vulnerability by mapping
 the regions that are likely to be hit hardest by the crisis (see Box 2). Furthermore, new
 taxes have been passed on alcoholic drinks, tobacco products and luxury cars which are
 expected to generate PLN 1.14 billion that would finance additional assistance to
 households (a measure supported in this program). Some o f these funds will be used to
 finance a response to the anticipated needs o f households in the parts o f Poland that are
 likely to feel the impact o f the economic crisis deepest. The Prime Minister's Office
 (PMO) and the Ministry o f Labor and Social Policy (MLSP) are proposing that the next
 regular adjustment of family benefits (scheduled for November 2009) be targeted only to
 families with three or more children.                     This approach would improve targeting to the
 poorest families and reduce the cost o f the adjustment from PLN 3.0 billion to P L N 0.7
 billion.




   InTable 4, CGHis the "Coady-Grosh-Hoddinnott"indicator as cited from Ringold, D.andL. Kasek,
 (2007) "Social Assistance inthe New EUMember States: StrengtheningPerformance and Labor Market
 Incentives" Working Paper No. 117, Washington DC. The CGH indicator is constructed by dividing the
 actual outcome by the neutral outcome for the bottomquintile (or decile) o fthe distribution ofhouseholds
 (by consumption). Ifthe poorest 20 percent ofhouseholdsreceived 30 percentofbenefits, the CGH
 indicator would be (30/20) = 1.5, i.e. targeting has ledto the poorest quintile receiving 50 percent more
 than they would have received hadbenefits been distributedevenly. As a means o f comparisonwith
 neighboring countries, a regional study on social assistance inthe new EUmember states found social
 assistance inLithuaniato be the best targeted with a CGHjust over 3.00. At the other extreme are social
 assistancebenefits inRussia with a CGH o f 1.10.


                                                               11

                           Box 1.Unemploymentand Social AssistanceinPoland
 Expenditures on the social safety net absorbed about 1.4 percent o f GDP in2006. The main programs
  include means tested social assistance (0.2 percent), a housing benefit for the poor (0.1 percent), means-
 tested family benefits (0.8 percent), and unemployment benefits (0.3 percent). Means tested programs
  are well-targeted relative to similar programs in neighboring countries, although substantial leakage to
 non-poor groups is still a concern. Poland, along with the Czech Republic and Slovenia, are the only
  countries among those inthe region that joined the EUinMay 2004 that target family benefits based on
  a means test. Since 2004, all benefits targeted to children have beenconsolidated with family benefits,
  contributing to the relatively more progressive distribution o f Poland's social assistanceprograms.

  In2007 about 47 percent ofthe population received some form of social assistance. About 24.2 percent
 received means tested family allowances and complementary benefits, and 6.7 percent received targeted
  social assistance cash and in-kindbenefits. Only 10 percent o f the unemployed (and only 2.7 percent o f
 the population) received an unemployment benefit, which reflects tight eligibility conditions for these
 benefits (12 months o f covered employment in the preceding 18 months) their limited duration (6
 months, 12 months in high unemployment regions, and 18 months in regions where the unemployment
 rate is twice the national average), and the large share o f long-term job-seekers among the unemployed.
  The number o f recipients o f unemployment benefits surged in the last couple o f months (in February
  2009 it was nearly 1/3 higher than a year earlier).

  The average social assistance cash benefit accounts for about 15 percent o f the average wage and 44
 percent o f the minimum wage (2007). The average family benefit accounts for 6.5 percent o f the
 minimumwage (2 percent ofthe averagewage), however, inover 50 percent ofcases it is supplemented,
 which doubles its amount. The regular unemployment benefit accounts for some 20 percent o f the
 average wage and 50 percent o f the minimumwage. Young workers (contribution record o f less than 5
 years) receive a benefit that i s 20 percent lower, and older workers (contribution record over 20 years)
 receive a benefit that is 20 percent higher.

 Coverage is fairly good, with 85 percent o f households in the first decile and 82 percent in the second
 decile receiving some form o f social protection. This includes "contributory" social insurance benefits,
 primarily old-age pensions. Not surprisingly, the coverage o f social insurance benefits is relatively even
 across the consumption distribution.      Social assistance - programs that are universally available to
 households with children regardless o f their means, and means-tested programs - cover over 64 percent
 o fhouseholds inthe poorest group.

 Although most social assistance benefits are means tested, there is room for improving their targeting
 efficiency. Estimates for 2007 show that gains intargeting efficiency could be made to mop up leakage
 o f means tested social assistance benefits being received by households in the higher consumption
 quintiles (see Table 4). However, a majority o f families covered by social assistance programs are
 families with children (7 1 percent), nearly half o f them representing single parent or pensioner families.
 Furthermore, 44 percent o f families who receive social assistance live in rural areas where the rate o f
 poverty i s highest. This incidence is greater than the share o f these households inthe population leading
 to progressive outcomes.


29.      The ability of the social safety net to respond could be hampered by an
ongoingprocess that began in 2004 of devolving financingresponsibility for social
assistance to sub-national governments. The Ministry of Labor and Social Policy
(MLSP) is continuing the process started with the Administrative Reform of 1999 that
decentralizes benefits and services for the poorest households, and since 2004 devolves a
portion of financing for these services. Local governments in Poland perform a set o f
tasks delegatedto them, with financing, by the central government. They also are free to
take on their "own tasks," with their own financing, as they see fit to serve their
communities. Prior to 2004, local governments were only responsible for delivering
social benefits and services, but since then, have taken responsibility for hllyfinancing a



                                                      12

growing set of "own tasks" in this sphere, along with a greater share of tax revenue to
cover these obligations.               MLSP is pushing ahead with its policy o f shifting social
assistance activities to the set of "own tasks." With the shift in financing responsibility,
local governments have a strong incentive to look for savings and to be more efficient. In
other parts o f the region, this incentive has sometimes led to compromised standards and
uneven delivery o f entitlements to the poorest households across municipalities of

                           Box 2. MappingHouseholdVulnerability to the EconomicCrisis

 To better prepare to meet the needs o f households vulnerable to the crisis the Government, through the PMO, is
 planning targeted regional interventions to support the powiats (counties) that are most affected. There are 379
 powiats inPoland, each considered a local labor market. The Government's plan is to strengthen local capacity to
 weather the crisis, byboth improvingthe effectiveness o f existing programs (employment and social assistance) and
 ifnecessary,byallocating additional resources for emergency assistance.
 This initiativehas three components and will be implemented in three corresponding stages. The first component i s
 the creation o f a crisis vulnerability map, meant to identifypowiats that are at the highest risk of suffering from the
 economic crisis. The map (see Box Figure) has been constructed based on 50 indicators characterizing powiats'
 economic structure, labor market conditions and their degree o f urbanization. Factor analysis was applied to
 construct a composite measure o f powiats' vulnerability to the crisis.          Four groups o f vulnerable powiats are
 identified, with the potential that somepowiats may fall into more than one group:
            Group A (Red in the Map, "Powiaty typ I ' y : Industrial and urbanizedpowiats with strong labor markets;
            Group B (Orange, "Powiaty typ II'y: Mixed industrial-agricultural powiats, moderately urbanized with
            relatively strong labor markets;
            Group C (Green Pin, "Powiaty ehportujqce")): Export orientedpowiats;
            Group D (Grid, "Powiaty nu liicie"): Otherpowiats that are vulnerable basedon expert opinion.




 Note that this mapping is focused on the impact o f economic recession, notjust poverty indicators. Thus, vulnerable
 powiats include some o f the most developedwith strong economies, rather than the poor, lagging regions. They are
 particularly susceptibleto higher unemployment rates and tend to contain manypeople livingclose to povertywho
 have migrated to these prosperous places to seek opportunities. The lagging regions rural, predominantly
                                                                                         -
 agricultural - are insulated from the crisis, at least temporarily, and benefit from longer term anti-poverty programs
 aimed at structural problems.

different incomes. The PER examines to what extent the shift infinancing responsibility
has changed the coverage and targeting efficiency of spending on social assistance. An
important consideration is whether the process of decentralizing not only administration
but financing of targeted social assistance programs to sub-national governments, has
impaired their ability to respond. Reflecting this concern, MLSP is closely monitoring
sub-national governments to ensure they meet the needs o f households eligible for
targeted social assistance.

              111.THE GOVERNMENT'SREFORMPROGRAM

30.       Despite this economic uncertainty, convergence to average EU living
standards remains the Government's overarching policy objective, for which it sees
adoption of the Euroas a key step. InSeptember 2008, Prime Minister Tusk announced
that Polandwas committed to Euro adoption from 2012, an ambitious target even before
the economic crisis. It will require maintaining financial stability and ensuring that the
Maastricht Criteria' are met in a sustainable manner, includingthrough a continuation of
a restrained fiscal policy. An acceleration of structural reforms aimed at increasing the
efficiency o f public spending - particularly in the social sectors - and flexibility in the
labor market will be needed both to support Euro adoption and a quick recovery of
growth.

31.       The authorities have taken steps to preserve financial stability in the current
difficult external environment. Inreaction to the escalation of the global crisis in the
fall of 2008, the NBP, the Government, Parliament and the Financial Supervision
Authority have taken steps to maintain confidence and support the effective functioning
ofthe financial system. InOctober, the NBP announceda "package of confidence" aimed
at preserving trust and liquidity in financial markets through expansion of its term
liquiditymanagementoperationsandforeign exchange swap operations.

32.       The Government is committed to maintaining fiscal discipline. The 2009
budget will be amended in July 2009 to reflect weaker growth and revenue prospects.
The most recent statements by the Ministry of Finance, following Poland's application
for a Flexible Credit Line from the IMF, suggest that the Government will attempt to
reach its original budget deficit goal of PLN 18.2 billion. Because o f the slowdown in
growth, the Government estimates that the budget deficit will increase to 4.6 percent o f
GDP in 2009, up from the original estimate of 2.5 percent. Obviously stringent fiscal
discipline would be neededto preserve market confidence, allow for further interest rate
cuts, andmeetthe criteria for adoption o fthe Euro in2012.



 A candidate to adopt the Euro as its currency must meetthe Maastricht or Convergence Criteria, which
are a set ofmacroeconomic indicators that measureprice stability (to show inflation is controlled);
soundnessand sustainability o fpublic finances (through limits on government borrowing and national
debt); exchange-rate stability (through participation inthe Exchange Rate Mechanism for at least two years
without strong deviations from central rate); and long-term interest rates (to assessthe durability ofthe
convergence achieved by fulfilling the other criteria). For more details see

33.      Need for flexibility on the macro framework.                          This loan provides an
opportunity for the World Bank to support the Government o f Poland in an uncertain
environment in which the Bank's support could contribute materially to increased
confidence in the Government's program, helping to lower its financing costs, reduce
pressures on the currency, and increase the feasibility of maintaining a challenging
trajectory to joining the Euro zone. The Government i s committed to initiating revisions
to its budget after it has more informationon the economic and budgetary record from the
first half o f the year. On May 6, 2009, the IMF Board approved an FCL of US$20.58
billion, which i s based on the country's track record rather than specific conditionality
connected to the current policy regime (see the Box 3).

                                      Box 3. IMFFlexible CreditLine
  Excerpt from IMF Press ReleaseNo. 09/85, "IMF Overhauls Lending Framework," March 24,2009

  "The IMF is introducing a new credit line for countries with very strong fundamentals, policies, and
  track records o f policy implementation. Access to the FCL credit line will be particularly useful for
  crisis prevention purposes. FCL arrangements would be approved for countries meeting pre-set
  qualification criteria. Access under the FCL would be determined on a case-by-case basis.
  Disbursements under the FCL would not be phased or conditioned to policy understandings as is the
  case under a traditional Fund-supported program. This flexible access is justified by the very strong
  track records o f countries that qualify for the FCL, which give confidence that their economic policies
  will remain strong.

  The pre-set qualification criteria are at the core ofthe FCL and serve to signal the Fund's confidence in
  the qualifying member's policies and ability to take corrective measures when needed. At the heart o f
  the qualification process i s an assessment that the member (a) has very strong economic fundamentals
  and institutional policy frameworks; (b) i s implementing-and         has a sustained track record o f
  implementing-very      strong policies, and (c) remains committed to maintaining such policies in the
  future. The relevant criteria for the purposes o f assessing qualification for an FCL arrangement
  include: (i)a sustainable external position; (ii) capital account position dominated by private flows;
                                                     a
  (iii)trackrecordofsteadysovereignaccesstointernationalcapitalmarketsatfavorableterms;(iv)a
       a
  reserve position that is relatively comfortable when the FCL is requested on a precautionary basis; (v)
  sound public finances, including a sustainable public debt position; (vi) low and stable inflation, inthe
  context o f a sound monetary and exchange rate policy framework; (vii) the absence o f bank solvency
  problems that pose an immediate threat o f a systemic banking crisis; (viii) effective financial sector
  supervision; and (ix) data transparency and integrity. Strong performance against all these criteria
  would not be necessary to secure qualification under the FCL, as compensating factors, including
  corrective policy measuresunderway, would be taken into account inthe qualification process."




34.      Management of Macroeconomic Risks. In approving Poland's FCL, the IMF
concluded, "The authorities have responded in a timely and effective manner to the
global downturn. They have embarked on a monetary loosening cycle, and stand ready to
cut ratesfurther if downside risks to the economy materialize. Financial sector stability
has been safeguarded, through liquidity provision and intensified surveillance. Despite
the slowdown in growth, the authorities remain committed to the 2009 state budget,
primarily by cutting expenditure at the state level. They reaffirmed theirfull commitment
to strengthen the medium-termfiscalframework to maintain a sustainablepathfor public

debt."6 Acknowledging that Poland continues to operate in an extremely uncertain
economic environment with a high risk o f a further deterioration, the Government has
agreed to a condition of effectiveness requiring that the government has initiated the
process of revising its 2009 budget in form and substance consistent with the measures
being supported by the Program. This condition aims, inparticular, to review continued
compliance with the first prior action of this loan, "Satisfactory continued
implementation of the 2009 budget in light o f the changed economic outlook (including
consideration of EC and IMF assessments)". This effectiveness condition would provide
upto 90 days after signing for review of 2009 budget implementation.

35.      To improve the quality of public financial management, the Government i s
gradually pushing ahead with reforms aimed at ensuring sustainable fiscal
consolidation. A new law on public finance was submitted and is currently being
discussed in Parliamentary committees. The Government expects the measure to be
passed in the fall of 2009. The draft law incorporates an organizational consolidation of
budgetary units and institutional measures that would make the budget more transparent
and predictable over the medium-term (through a 4-year budget planning horizon), and
more performance oriented. The draft law also aims to take corrective measurestriggered
by increasesinpublic debt andto strengthenexpenditure control through newregulations
on internal control and external audit.

36.      To boost labor force participation,the Governmenthas launcheda package
of measures to reduce incentives for people to remain inactive that have been
created by social transfers and associated taxes, particularly among women and
older workers. The tax wedge on labor was substantially reduced by a cut in payroll
taxes by seven percentage points in 2007 and 2008. The Government also prepared a
comprehensive program, known as "Intergenerational Solidarity - 50+", which includes a
number of incentives to stimulate labor force participationbyolder workers, inparticular
a substantial tightening of early retirement provisions. "Bridge pensions" for those
employed in special difficult conditions, effective from 2009, replaced generous early
retirement schemes. The Government expects these reforms to reduce the number of
people eligible for early retirement pensions from about 1.7 million to around 300
thousand. Inthe mediumterm, the Government intends to raise labor force participation
by improving workforce skills and developing opportunities for life-long learning,
reforming labor market intermediation services, improving the impact o f active labor
market programs, supporting women willing to re-enter the labor market after child birth,
andpromoting longer working lives through social campaigns.

37.     To support and complement reforms to the labor market, the Government
has pursueda programof reformin education. The Government's education reform
agenda aims to reduce the gap between needs and available skills in the labor force, to
develop flexible skills and a strong base for lifelong learning, and to address long-
standing problems in the financing o f higher education and research. It i s struggling to

adjust the education systemto a declining population while redeploying limitedresources
to increase its competitiveness and the equity o f its subsidies for human capital
investments.

38.     At the primary and secondary levels of the education system, the
Government's reform objective is to adjust to demographic trends that will not be
easy to change. Since 2000, primary and secondary enrollments have droppedby almost
1.5 million students to about 5.5 million in total.     Two major constraints slow the
adjustment o f teachers and schools to the number o f students. The Teacher's Charter
governs employment relations between all levels o f government and teachers. It limits
the ability o f municipalities to demand more from their teachers or to reduce their
numbers.    A second constraint is a requirement that the capitation-driven education
subvention not decrease intotal amount below the previous year's level; hence localities
with falling numberso f students are under less pressure than they otherwise would be to
make appropriate adjustments.        The response o f Government has been to give
municipalities more tools to adjust supply to demand at the primary levels o f the
education systemwhile also taking this opportunity to pull younger cohorts - ages 6, 5,4,
and 3 - into schools both to prepare them for formal education and to use excess
educational resources more effectively.

39.     The Government's reform strategy in education charts a course of actions to
improve secondary and tertiary instruction and to increase the efficiency of
research spending. At the secondary level, the Government has increased quality by
delaying the tracking o f students into vocational education and by simplifying the
vocational track so that it converges with general education. The success o f this effort
has led to improvements in Polish students' performance on international examinations
and, inturn, to an evenmore energetic effort to converge tracks and delay tracking to the
tenth grade. At the university level, the Government's focus i s to rationalize public
subsidies in higher education and become one o f the first Eastern European countries to
start allocating state-financed tuition and housing subsidies as well as subsidies for
student loans based on need, starting in 2010. Finally, the Government i s preparing
reforms to increase the relevance o f research.       As o f 2009, Poland is increasing
allocations to research while trying to move from a preponderance o f basic research to a
greater share o f research with a direct impact on the economy. It i s shifting as well to a
system o fprofessionally refereed, competitive grants.

40.     The key challenges of health sector in Poland are to maintain services to all
during a financial downturn, to achieve higher efficiency in resource allocation, and
to improve the quality and appropriateness of service delivery. In this regard, the
major impediment for two decades has been the overhang o f an economically unviable
hospital sector characterized by excessive infrastructure and beds. Despite substantial
progress rationalizing the hospital network and cutting down the number o f beds, with
important exceptions, hospitals have continued to accumulate public debts (failure to pay
social security and other taxes) and civil debts (borrowings and receivables owed to
suppliers).




                                            17

41.     The Government plans to address the hospital debt problem through an
initiative to corporatize hospitals under commercial law so that debts are treated as
for a commercial enterprise, subject to commercial audit standards and bankruptcy.
Corporatization will be done initially using a voluntary approach because a law makingit
compulsory was vetoed inearly 2009. The voluntary window was openedby a resolution
by the Cabinet of Ministers taken in February 2009, with implementing arrangements
approved inMay 2009. Inthe past eight years, 72 hospitals have been corporatized as a
result of local government decisions. 90 percent of these hospitals are current in their
accounts. In contrast, the roughly 630 hospitals operating as government organizations
have runup about PLN10.5 billion of debt on roughlyPLN25 billion inannualrevenue (a
42 percent debt-to-revenueratio, about 25 percent inpublic debt and75 percent indebtto
other firms and banks).     The Government expects about 210 hospitals to join the
corporatizationprogram. The public hospitals will beliquidated, with the MOF financing
the public debt and the local authorities taking on most of the private debt. When a
hospital emerges from liquidation as a new entity under the commercial code, it will be
debt free, will be operating under an approved 5-year restructuring program, and will be
monitored twice yearly for financial and technical adherence to the program. The MOH
and NFZ estimate that virtually all hospitals can operate on a cash basis, with the
revenues they earn, once current debt service requirements are removed.              The
corporatized hospitals are expected to have surpluses once they emerge from liquidation,
which would allow them to invest inthemselves as well. The program will be monitored
through yearly reports to the CouncilofMinisters.

42.     To further rein in costs, Poland is implementing DRGs (Diagnostically
Related Groups) as a cost accounting mechanism in all facilities in 2009. This i s a
major step forward in shifting reimbursementsfrom inputs to outputs. DRGs will allow
NFZ to stop reimbursing hospitals based on their activities and start paying a
predeterminedrate based on a patient's diagnosis. DRG financing creates an incentive
for hospitals and doctors to economize in the use of resources. It facilitates cost
comparisons across facilities andthe use of treatmentprotocols to improve patient care.

43.     The corporatization of hospitals allows the MOH and NFZ to improve the
accreditation and regulatory framework under which hospitals and clinics operate.
The MOH has drafted enabling regulations to develop this framework, which will create
a tool that can be usedin conjunction with DRG-based reimbursementsto raise the cost-
effectiveness and quality of the health services beingfinanced. Other reforms, including
the introduction of a multiple competitive private insurance system and the expansion of
long-term care services, are seen as longer term challenges for which the Government is
beginning to develop options. Monitoring and evaluation remains an underused tool in
the health sector even though excellent methods are now available to improve the
efficacy of spending, and the Government plans to begin developing this capability as
part of its performance-basebudgeting initiative.

   IV. POLICY FOCUSAND THE BANK-SUPPORTEDPROGRAM

44.     The EU has become Poland's main external partner. The EU has committed
EUR 67 billion in grants to Poland over the period 2007-2013, equivalent to about 4


                                            18

percent o f Poland's GDP per year, to support income convergence o f the country and its
regions with the wealthier parts o f Europe. This support is focused on development o f a
knowledge economy and infrastructure. The EIB has increased its lendingsubstantially in
recent years to provide co-financing for the EU structural and cohesion funds through
loans on attractive terms. Further increases are envisaged in response to the ongoing
global financial and economic crisis. The EIB has traditionally focused on infrastructure
projects (especially transport) but has become more involved in other sectors o f the
economy, including sub-national lending. The EBRD has largely phased out o f Poland
and the EU's new member states, as has the IFC, although this may change again in
response to the crisis.

45.     The Bank adds value to Poland's convergence agenda by focusing its support
in areas where it has an established track record of experience, particularly public
financial management, labor market efficiency, structural improvements to the social
sector expenditures, and encouraging a culture o f evaluation and performance. The Bank
has worked with the Government to marshal knowledge and international experience on
performance based budgeting and the effective use o f MTEF. The Bank's labor
economists have engaged with the Government on reform o f unemployment insurance,
increasing flexibility in the labor market, encouraging labor market participation, and
making active labor market programs more cost-effective.              Their work has been
complemented by technical collaboration with the ministries handling education, science,
and higher education on issues in education financing, testing, and shifting the focus to
general education and life-long learning. The Bank has been engaged for over a decade
insupport ofPoland's pensionandhealthsector reforms.

46.     These engagements complement the EU's Lisbon Agenda in support of
growth and competitiveness. Both education and health are largely excluded from the
EU Acquis Communuutuire and EU-support programs. The World Bank was deeply
engaged with Poland in these areas prior to accession in 2004. Subsequently, it has
maintained technical involvement through cross-country AAA focused on the accession
countries, and ineducation it re-engaged technically beginningin2008.

4.1. LINKTO COUNTRYPARTNERSHIPSTRATEGY

47.     The second operation in the program is being presented alongside a new
CountryPartnershipStrategy (CPS). As described above, the CPS aims to situate the
Bank's engagement inPoland firmly inthe context o f other external partners and focuses
on niche areas o f engagement where the Bank can add value. The Bank's strategic
partnership with Poland i s based on four pillars: (i)     Growth and Competitiveness; (ii)
Public Sector Reform; (iii) and Spatial Inclusion; and (iv) Regional and Global
                             Social
Public Goods. Public financial management reform, labor market efficiency and social
sector reform are key elements o f the first three pillars. As such, the policy lending series
provides an anchor for the strategic dialogue between the World Bank and the Polish
authorities, supported by analytical work andtechnical co-operation activities.

   Box 4. SupportingHighand SustainableEconomicGrowthinPolandover the MediumTerm

 Although recent economic performance has been impressive, Poland still faces constraints which may
 slow down the real convergence process. In2007, Poland's GDP per capita at purchasing power parity
 amounted to 53.6 percent o f the average for the EU-27. A continuedrapidreduction o f the income gap
 requires high and sustainable growth based on productivity increases, higher employment, and
 increased investment rates. Potential medium- to long-term growth rates are estimated at around 4.5
 percent, assuming a continued gradual increase in employment rates, rapid investment growth, and
 continued robust productivity growth.       There is broad consensus among the government and its
 internationalpartners that policy interventions aimed at promoting high and sustainable growth should
 be focused on the following three broad areas that characterize this policy program:

      (a) Public finance and administrative reforms aimed at continued fiscal consolidation,
           lowering o f the tax burden, re-orientation o f spending towards more productive areas,
           improved public financial management, and improved public administration (public finance
           and administrative reform);
      (b) Promoting private sector investment through an improved investment climate, more
           product market flexibility, and restructuring o fkey sectors (structural reforms); and
      (c) Increasing labor force participation and employment to mher reduce poverty and
           encourage social inclusion (labor supply mobilization).

 Public finance reforms are required to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances.
 Further fiscal consolidation i s needed to improve macroeconomic stability and provide room for
 countercyclical fiscal policy. A lower tax burden and simpler tax system would encourage formal
 private sector activity. A re-orientation and restructuring o f spending would provide fiscal space for
 increased productive spending, notably on infrastructure, and improved outcomes in health and
 education. Public financial management reforms would improve the transparency and predictability o f
 public finances. Public administration reforms would improve management, service delivery, policy
 coordination, and a capacity and results orientation at all levels o f government (including the reform
 and modernization o f Poland's courts).

 Structural reforms are needed to improve the general investment climate and support the
 restructuringof low-productivity sectors. Polandranked76 out o f 181countries onDoing Business
 Indicators. For starting a business, construction, and paying taxes, it ranked 142 or worse. Further
 deregulation that includes a simplification o f its onerous legal, tax, and administrative environment for
 entrepreneurship and business development continues to be a priority. In addition, by restructuring
 sectors such as coal and energy generation, removing incentives for people to remain in low-
 productivity agriculture, and accelerating the privatization process (including in what are considered
 strategic sectors), the Government could facilitate a faster shift from old industrial, low-productivity
 sectors to newjob-rich, high-productivity sectors.

 Labor suppry mobilization is needed to raise low employment rates, not least among the older
 cohorts and women, and to improve the skills of the workforce. Reform o f the system o f social
 protection and labor taxation, development o f more flexible forms o f employment, improving and
 evaluating active labor market programs targeted at disadvantaged groups, and promoting life-long
 learning are important actions to increase labor force participation and productivity.               The
 Government's actions to limit the number o f professions entitled to early retirement i s in line with the
 principles o f the pension reform introduced in 1999 and supports increased labor force participation.
 Yet it still has a pressing need to increase the pace o f reform inthe education system to improve labor
 market relevance and skills. While outward migration has been a concern following EU accession,
 remittances have been substantial, and people are beginning to return as economic prospects improve
 at home.

48.     The overarching goal of the CPS is to supportPoland's convergencetowards

                                                      20

EU living standards. The program o f policy lending is an important instrument in the
strategy. In the short term, as Poland faces an outlook o f high economic uncertainty
created by the global economic crisis, it will be important for the Bank to support
adequate social safety nets during the economic downturn and changes in labor market
regulation likely to accelerate economic recovery. Inthe medium-term the program i s
not yet well defined but will support the resumption o f growth and convergence with EU
living standards.   New modalities o f engagement are being explored, including sub-
sovereign activities and a move towards cost-sharing or fee-based services.

4.2. RELATIONSHIPTO OTHERBANKOPERATIONS

49.     The reforms supportedinthe programwill benefitfrom prior Bankfinanced
assistance at the local level.     The Post Accession Rural Support Project (PARSP),
approved by the Bank in 2005, provides assistance to rural gminas to enhance the
capacity o f local governments to identify, plan, and execute social protection strategies
through a Social Inclusion Program (SIP).       The project i s implemented in 500 rural
gminas, where it has helped to increase the capacity o f local governments as well as to
engage communities - by emphasizing participation and building on social capital - in
monitoring the use o f resources and social transfers. As the reforms supported by the
program o f policy lending help to put more decisions into the hands o f local authorities,
the capacity created with support of the PARSP will become critical. The Bank has also
provided support to the agricultural insurance fund (KRUS) reform to improve the
efficiency o f the KRUS Agency by strengthening its administrative and analytic
capacities, its management, and its decision-makingprocesses.

4.3. ANALYTICAL UNDERPININGS

50.     The specific measures supported by the program have been identified
through analyticalwork conducted prior to and in parallelwith loan preparation.
The measures selected for support inthe second andthirdpolicy loans are fully owned by
the government and address core policy issues in each o f the sectors. Inmany cases, the
economic and financial crisis has given specific actions particular urgency, as explained
in this section, and the pressure may mount during the coming months for additional
structural reforms to reduce long-term expenditure obligations while redirecting
resources in the short term to the social protection system to respond to additional
demands inthe constrained fiscal environment.

51.     The reformof public financialmanagementpracticeshas become even more
importantthan beforethe crisis. Two major reforms -the introduction o fmedium-term
expenditure frameworks (MTEF) and performance-based budgeting (PBB) - have been
central elements in improving the management o f public finances. MTEFs have been
developed and refined by many countries to help build fiscal policy credibility and
predictability via a strategic, multi-year, budget planning perspective. At the same time,
PBB concepts and methods have been important in many countries to bring a greater
focus on the results from government spending. International experience suggests that,
implemented together, PBB and MTEF reforms can significantly raise the quality and
consistency o f forward estimates o f public expenditures through common use o f policy-


                                             21

based expenditure programs and program- and activity-based costing methodologies.
These budget reforms have been on the agenda of most new EU Member States and
candidate countrie~.~

52.      Polandhas made substantialprogressin the last three years in performance
budgeting and will introduce a multi-year system of budget preparation. An
indicative performance budget - including a programmatic breakdown o f expenditures,
program objectives, and key performance indicators - is now presented to the Parliament
for information alongside the traditional annual budget. Further steps will be requiredto
move from this promising start to a position where the budget is appropriated on a
program basis and budgeting becomes truly performance-informed.                       Accounting and
financial management information systems would need to be reformed to support
budgeting by program.           Performance indicators and program evaluation mechanisms
would be required.         On-going refinement o f the program structure and definition o f
program objectives would needto be institutionalized.

53.      Improved institutional collaboration in the design and implementation of
these reforms will be crucial to their success. The key element o f the government's
medium-termbudgetinginitiative is a new Multi-Year State Financial Plan (MYSFP), to
be voted on by the parliament. The MYSFP will be a four-year fixed plan covering the
period o f each government's term in office. It i s not expected to set binding multi-year
aggregate fiscal limits but will instead focus on improved fiscal projections and a
statement o f the government's medium-term fiscal policy. For this to make a difference
to macro-fiscal policy, the required statement o f medium-term fiscal policy should be
specific (e.g. including numerical fiscal targets) rather than general in nature. However,
the most important requirement for improved medium-term budgeting in Poland i s a
substantial improvement in the quality o f projections o f medium-term expenditures and
revenues. Only on the basis of much better projections will it be possible to properly
assess, and then take action to ensure, the compatibility o f existing expenditure and
revenue policies with mediumterm aggregate fiscal policy.*

54.      With respect to the labor market, the priorities lie in maintaining (and
hopefully increasing) labor force participation,,particularly among older people.
Until2007, the unemployment rate was indouble digits and the employment to working
age population ratio was around 55 percent, far below the Lisbon target o f 70 percent
adopted by the EU. One major factor contributing to the low ratio was the low labor
force participation rate among older workers, which i s the lowest inthe EU. Inaddition,
the incidence o f long-term unemployment was high, leading to labor market exclusion
and poverty. Labor resources were thus substantially underutilized. In this context the



 Kasek L.,Webber D. (ed.), Performance-based budgeting and medium-term expenditurefiameworks in
Emerging Europe, forthcoming, World Bank Study.
 The success ofperformance budgeting and medium-term budgetinginPolandrequires substantial
additional capacity building, extending the thematic scope o fthe major performance budgeting training
effort which is currently underway with EUsupport. Further technical support would be beneficial ina
number ofareas, includingaccountinghancial management information systems, evaluation and
performance indicator development.


                                                    22

Government has undertaken reforms aimed at increasing the employmentipopulation
ratio, especially among older workers.

55.     Recent improvements in employment and labor market efficiency will be
challenged by the crisis.       The improvements in economic activity and employment
could be severely hampered by the global economic crisis. Since the last quarter o f 2008
the unemployment rate has started to increase again. The Government faces a challenge
o f preventing large scale job losses, mass unemployment and labor market exclusion. It
i s focused on measures that will not only help employers and workers mitigate the costs
o f the downturn but will also prepare the labor market for a recovery. To cope with these
challenges the Government recently initiated tripartite negotiations, including trade
unions' and employers' representatives, on an "anti-crisis package."               In addition, the
Government decided to reform the unemployment benefit system to strengthenjob search
incentives and to shorten the duration of unemployment. Finally, the Government plans
to improve the efficiency and targeting o f active labor market programs (such as
(re)training, wage subsidies and public works) to help the unemployed find new jobs and
prevent long-term unemployment.

56.     Featuresof Poland's retirementincome security (pension) system encourage
early retirement, at a substantial fiscal cost, and contributeto the low labor force
participation of older workers.         In most pension systems in the region the rate of
system dependency (the ratio o f beneficiaries to contributors) is high relative to
population dependency (the ratio o f elderly to the working age population).' The number
o f beneficiaries per contributor i s significantly higher than the ratio o f retirement-age
population to working-age population, leading to highpension expenditures coupled with
moderately low revenues and a fiscal problem. Two o f the most common reasons for the
high system dependency rates are the high rate o f disability pensions awarded to those
below the normal retirement age and the high rate o f early retirement pensions. Reducing
these components will help bring down pension expenditures and help raise additional
contribution revenue, bringing the systems closer to balance. Reducing incentives for
choosing disability pensions and tightening the criteria for early retirement will both help
to reduce system dependency rates and increase the fiscal sustainability of the publicly
managed pillar.

57.     As privatelymanaged, mandatoryretirementsavings gaininimportanceas a
part of old-age income security, the funded pillar of the pensionsystem will need to
become moreefficient. The payout options needto be designed so that they are flexible
enough to withstand market fluctuations while protecting workers. The use o f multiple
portfolios with a mandatory shift toward a fixed income portfolio inthe years just prior to
retirement i s being pursued as a way o f protecting workers against sudden drops in the
valuation of financial assets just prior to retirement. Measures40 lower costs to affiliates
will help increase the balances availableto participatingworkers when they retire.

58.     The foundation to accelerating Poland's convergence with EU living
standards, is improvingthe return on the country's investmentin education. Total
spending on education in Poland stood at 5.25 percent o f GDP in2007, which i s slightly
higher than the OECD average, but in absolute amount it i s less than half the OECD
average because o f Poland's lower GDP. How Poland spends its money on education i s
critical to its effectiveness inbuildinghuman capital equitably and investing in its fiture
productivity and competitiveness.

59.     Primary and secondary education are fully decentralized to local
governments. Management o f schools became a responsibility o f local governments in
1999, the complete antithesis o f the old management structures relying on central
administration.     Gminas manage primary schools.        Powiats and Voivodeships are
responsible for secondary and post-secondary schools. Public colleges and universities
are funded directly by the State.       The Ministry o f Finance transfers an education
subvention to local governments through an algorithm that emphasize student enrollment.
A share of tax revenues (51% o f the personal income tax and 24% o f the corporate
income tax) i s transferred to local governments, and an equalization grant that takes into
account local revenues i s also distributed. These finds are transferred from the Ministry
o f Finance to 2,487 municipal governments, over 300 counties, and 16 regions. Local
governments autonomously decide how the money i s spent. Infact, they may fund non-
educational expenditures with the education subvention, as it enters their budgets as an
"unmarked" grant with no specific earmarking. In practice, local governments spend
more than the amount o f the education subvention on schools, and for the country as a
whole, it covers approximately 100 percent o f the wage bill, with localities covering the
remainingcosts through other revenues.

60.     At the primary and secondary levels of the educationsystem, there has been
a precipitousdrop in the number of students, caused by demographic trends that
will not be easy to change. Since 2000, primary and secondary enrollments have
dropped by almost 1.5 million students to about 5.5 million in total. While some urban
schools continue to grow, rural schools are extremely hard hit by the declining number o f
children. Inthe past 4 years, college and university enrollments have leveled off at about
2 million, after nearly tripling inthe 1990s. Unless Poland's already high enrollment rate
at the tertiary level, which stands at about 50 percent today, continues to increase, the
smaller cohorts will soon also drag tertiary enrollments down.        It is difficult for the
systemto adjust fast enough to maintain efficient use o f education finds. The Teacher's
Charter limits both the ability o f municipalities to demand more from their teachers and
to reduce their numbers. The figure below shows the inadequate adjustment o f the
number o f teachers to the decline in the student population. As this discrepancy is
compounded year by year, the stock o f teachers relative to the stock o f students has
become increasingly distorted: a 16 percent decline in students was accompanied by only
a 6 percent decrease in teacher full time equivalents. A second constraint requires that
the education subvention not decrease in total amount below the previous year's level;
hence localities with falling numbers o f students are under less pressure than they
otherwise would be to make appropriate adjustments.          Municipalities require more
flexibility to adjust supply to demand at the primary levels o f the education system while
also taking this opportunity to pull younger cohorts - ages 6, 5, 4, and 3 - into schools


                                            24

both to prepare them for formal education and to use excess educational resources more
effectively. The latter effort should increase Poland's low enrollment o f children in
preschool and correct the inequity caused by much higher enrollment rates in cities
relative to rural areas.

61.     At higher levels of education, the priorities are to improve quality and to
achieve greater equity. At the secondary level, the Government has increased quality
by delaying the tracking o f students into vocational education and simplifying the
vocational track so that it converges with general education. The success o f this effort
has led to improvements in Polish students' performance on international examinations
and, inturn, to an even more energetic effort to converge tracks and delay tracking to the
tenth grade.     In addition, the Government has overhauled achievement testing by
introducing external exams at all levels and reforming the school-leaving exam (matura)
at the secondary level. Recently the authorities added foreign language testing to both
types o f exams and for the first time in2009/10 will introduce mathematics testing to the
matura. At the university level, a hallmark of Poland's development since 1989 has been
a flourishing network o f private institutions to meet an explosion o f pent-up demand for
tertiary places. Unfortunately, the system o f financing has not kept pace with the change
inthecompositionofstudents andthe market. Merit-based, all-expenses-paid entrance to
public university day classes has always skewed public subsidies to better-off
households, but the introduction o f unsubsidized night classes and full-cost private
options for students not qualifying for public subsidies has made outcomes more
inequitable. To a large degree, better-off families succeed ingetting subsidies and poorer



                                                  25

families pay. A subsidized student loan program was introduced, but take-up by banks
and students has been low, as the design o f the program makes it unattractiveto potential
lenders and borrowers. Starting in2010, Polandwill begin to rationalize public subsidies
in higher education and become one of the first Eastern European countries to start
allocating a significant share o f state-financed tuition and housing subsidies, as well as
subsidies for student loans, based on need.

62.     Poland's performancein improvinghealththroughambitiousreformsof the
health sector has been impressive. Through a series o f reforms since 1997, the
Government has achieved virtually 100 percent coverage o f the population through its
public health insurance system, using a combination o f social health insurance and
general budget financing. Workers who lose their jobs retain insurance and access to
services, but the payment o f premiums is shifted to another source o f funds. A measure
o f the relative success o f Poland in improving health outcomes i s shown in Figure 3,
which compares Poland with its neighbor, Ukraine, as well as the EU countries before
2004. Although health care i s only part o f the explanation, o f course, Poland has been
one o f the best performers inEastern Europe inimproving health. Convergence with the
EU, never feasible before 1990, becomes possible as the rate o f improvement has started
to accelerate.

63.     The measures supported by the program are aimed at modernizing the
hospital network. Poland's ability to reallocate funding to primary and preventive
programs has been limited by its inherited stock o f outmoded, costly, and inefficiently
large hospitals. Like schools, the hospitals are owned by local governments and other
entities such as universities, so the central government can only affect decisions through
the insurance payment mechanism, legal requirements, and incentives. Nevertheless, the



                                              26

Government has whittled away at the number o f beds successfully since 2005, which
reduces costs and has begun to "right-size" the system relative to the need for beds.
However, with important exceptions, hospitals have consistently accumulated public
debts (failure to pay social security and other taxes) and civil debts (borrowings and
receivables owed to suppliers). The program o f hospital "corporatization" launched by
the Government this year, supported bythis loan, is key to increasingefficiency o f health
service delivery.

                         V. THE PROPOSED POLICY LOAN

64.       This is the second lending operation in a program of three. The second
lending operation (PL2) will support reforms to public financial management, further
steps to strengthen the private sector, structural measures to improve labor market
efficiency, greater openness to private sector development, and reforms to the finance and
provision o f health, education and social protection. The latter three areas account for
about 62 percent o f public spending, down from 65 percent in 2003. Of spending on
social protection, 9.4 percent o f GDP i s spent on old age pensions. See Table 5.

5.1. PROGRAMOBJECTIVES

65.       The second lending operation will continue to support the convergence
agenda,butwill focus morenarrowlyon sector reforms. The first loan inthe program
(PL1) supported a broad range o f policy actions to strengthen public finance
management, improved business environment, and higher labor market participation.
The policy actions taken by the Government prior to presentation o f the first loan to the
Board included: satisfactory implementation o f the 2008 budgetandpresentation of 2009
budget bill consistent with the Convergence Program; a reduction in payroll taxes to
lower the cost o f labor; elimination o f required work permits for foreign workers from
neighboring countries to increase the labor supply; tightening eligibility requirements for
disability benefits; legislation that reduces the minimum capital required to start a


                                              27

business; and the approval o f a privatization program encompassing the sale o f 740 state
owned enterprises. As reported in the sections below, the Government has met all the
triggers agreed for the second operation PL2.

66.     The second lendingoperationin the program(PL2) will continue to support
reformsinitiatedwith the first loanwhile broadeningthe focus to includestructural
improvementsin, and maintenanceof, criticalprogramsin the social sectors. Inthe
months since the first loan was disbursed, the external economic environment has
changed substantially, causing growth in Poland to slow sharply. To better manage the
uncertainty that the economic crisis has introduced to Poland's outlook and fiscal targets,
as well to push ahead with reform o f public financial management, the Government is
now focusing on the part o f the program specifically targeting the labor market,
education, health and social protection.       The second operation has the following
development policy objectives: (i)to support structural reforms that will ensure fiscal
consolidation over the medium term; (ii)   to protect priority investment programs and the
up-front fiscal costs o f structural reforms critical to meeting Poland's goals o f
convergence with the rest o f the EU; and (iii) to mitigate the social cost o f the economic
crisis. Intaking stock o f the Government's progress inmeeting the triggers for PL2, its
careful fiscal management amidst growing constraints; policy achievements in education
and health; and the steps it has taken to mitigate the impact o f the crisis, should be taken
into account.

5.2. REFORMSSUPPORTEDBYTHISLOAN PRIORACTIONSFORPL2  -
 (see Annex 2 PolicyMatrix)

67.     Public Financial Management.           AAer three years o f strong economic
performance, even though Poland is faring better than other countries in the region, the
global financial crisis has worsened its macroeconomic and fiscal outlook. With fewer
resources and in a fast evolving economic environment, the Government faces a difficult
challenge to reconcile longer term with shorter term fiscal objectives. Inpublic financial
management, PL2 supports three prior actions:

        Satisfactory continuing implementation of the 2009 budget in light of
        changingeconomic circumstances. InJanuary, line ministrieswere prepared for
        the need to curtail discretionary expenditure by 10 percent.         Certain priority
        expenditure items were protected from expenditure reductions. For example, in
        the education sector, the per-capita transfer to sub-national governments was set
        aside before the 10 percent savings were identified; while inhealth, financing for
        specific public health programs was set aside. The Government is expected to
        present a supplementary budget in late June or July that makes the January cuts
        permanent and may include other cuts and revenue measures. As a condition o f
        effectiveness, the Government has agreed to initiate the process o f revising its
        2009 budget in form and substance consistent with the measures being supported
        by the program. Throughout the program, the Bank will continue to consult with
        the IMF and the E C on their assessmento f Poland's fiscal policy stance.

    .
        Further advances in the preparationand introductionof performance-based
        budget and medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF).                          These
        institutional reforms can help to prioritize expenditures and support medium-term
        fiscal consolidation. The introduction o f a performance-based budget for 2009
        was a major achievement. As part o f the 2010 budget preparation, Government
        envisages broadening the coverage, improving the classification o f functions,
        clarifying objectives, and developing indicators.
        Submission to Parliamentof the amended Law on Public Finance: The law,
        which     incorporates  institutional measures to      improve public      financial
        management, was submitted to Parliament in late 2008 and is expected to be
        adopted by Parliament in fall 2009. The amended law includes provisions for a
        four-year rollingmedium-termexpenditure framework.

68.     Private Sector Reforms. The Government has focused on two specific aspects
o f private sector development: improving its regulatory interface with businesses and
continuing to privatize remaining state-owned enterprises. The privatization program
was rejuvenated by the current government after lapsing for several years.          In both
    .
aspects, the prior actions agreed for PL2 have been met, namely:

        Amendment of the Law on Freedom of Business Operations to unify and
        coordinate business inspectionprocedures, scheduling and duration among
        all inspectionauthorities. The Act was amended in late 2008, and the changes
        in business inspection have been in full effect since March 2009.              This
        amendment limits the amount o f time inspections can take place and the number
        o f inspections that a business can be subjected to at the same time. It opens
        additional avenues o f appeal for business owners who disputeinspection findings.
        The amended law creates a "one-stop shop" for business licensing and
        registration, makes it substantially less onerous for businesses to cease operations
        either temporarily or permanently, and reduces the ability o f government officials
        to reject regulatory submissions for incompleteness, allowing them to be
        amended. Inaddition, the Government began an intensive effort to catalogue all
        inspections done by all branches o f government to remove additional
        redundancies and inconsistencies, with the intention o f reorganizing like activities
    .   into one agency. This work will be supported by PL3.
        Offer of the first 80 publicsector enterprisesinthe privatizationprogram(or
        those constituting10 percentof aggregateasset value) for sale on the market
        (through stock exchange or by auction) or via competitive tenders. Despite
        difficult market conditions, out o f 740 firms in its privatization program, the
        Government sold shares o f 75 companies in 2008 and 11 in 2009, or 86 in total.
        The program continues to put together packages for sale and has recently
        introduced auctions. Large power firms are expected to be sold in 2009 (Enea)
        and 2010 (Tauron and Energa), causing a steep rise inexpected revenues from the
        program at exactly the time that the Government may have additional financing
        needs due to the economic downturn.




                                              29

  69.      Labor MarketReforms. Turningto labor and employment, the Governmenthas
  continued to implement the reform program documented in PLl. Key prior actions for
 the second lendingoperationare:
      .    Implementation of the government program to increase labor force
           participation of older workers, known as "50+."                    In 2008 the Government
           markedly reduced the tax wedge for labor by reducing disability payroll taxes by
           six percentage points. A second major issue the Government has faced i s the low
           participation rate o f older workers. It has addressed this problem by reducing
           eligibility for early retirement, reducing some o f the social security contributions
           as they near retirement age, and making older workers eligible for employment
           services. These changes have been implemented in the first quarter o f 2009. In
           addition, legislation is being prepared to allow those with disability pensions to
      .    work without losing their benefits.

           Improvements to the incentive structure of unemployment benefits.
           Legislation was enacted in December 2008 to raise benefits to improve the
           consumption-smoothing function o f unemployment insurance, but at the same
           time benefits were reduced after 3 months o f unemployment to encourage job
           search. These changes have beenimplemented as o f January 2009.''

 70.       Education Sector Reforms. There has been substantial progress in reforming
 Poland's education system, focused on expanding access to preschool education and
 improving the efficiency and quality o f primary and secondary education.                         Current
reform efforts in higher education are also set to deliver more equitable access and more
relevant skills among graduates. The lending program recognizes this progress. Key
     .
 actions takenby the Government supported by PL2 are:

           Legislationapprovedthat initiates a compulsorypre-primary programfor 5
           year-old children (Grade 0) starting from 2011/12 and begins voluntary
           implementation in 2009/10. The same law initiates a compulsory school
           programfor 6 year-old childrenfrom 2012/13. Given 40 years o f accumulated
           evidence o f the impact o f early childhood education in helping children succeed
           once they are in formal school, Poland will require 5-year-old children to enter
           school beginning in the 2011/12 school years. These children will then become
           the first mandatory class o f 6-year-olds in regular primary school the following
           year. Up to that point, it will be voluntary for 5-year-olds but mandatory for 6-
           year-olds to be in kindergarten. This reform will help Poland catch up to other
           EU members in investing in the early participation o f children in formal
           education.

 loCurrently the unemployment benefit i s a flat rate set at PLN 504 (for comparison, the minimumwage in
Poland is PLN 1260). FromJanuary 2010, the amount will rise to PLN 717 duringthe first 3 months o f
unemployment, and to PLN 580 thereafter. The maximum duration o fbenefits is 6 months inpowiats
(districts) where the rate o funemployment is less than 125% o f the national average, 12 months inpowiats
where unemployment is less than 200% o f the national average, and 18 months where unemployment is
greater than 200% o f the national average.

   .
        Developmentof primary and secondary education: The other elements of the
        matrix capture the Government's efforts to help municipalities manage the
        reduced need for classrooms and teachers as cohort sizes shrink; to attract and
        retain young, well educated teachers by raising entry-level salaries relative to
        those of older teachers; and to improve quality and outcomes through the reform
        o f vocational education, improved testing, and analysis o f test results to improve
        schooling.

71.     Health Sector Reforms. Polandhas developed a robust and adequately financed
health insurance program that protects citizens from the adverse consequences o f health
costs. For years it has struggled with a number o f efficiency problems that are being
effectively addressed by the Government through a series o f structural reforms. For
example, a key element o f health sector reform that has never been successfully tackled
has been the tendency o f hospitals to accumulate debt, which i s periodically paid off at
tremendous cost to national and local government budgets, only to be run up again. In
addition, incentives to control costs in the hospital sector have never been successfully
imposed. The resultant drain on resources for hospitals has limited authorities' ability to
shift resources to programs that would be more effective inimproving the health o f the
population. A core structural initiative o f the Government i s to gain control over these
   .
persistent problems. Supported by PL2, key actions inthe Governments program are:

        Approve an implementationplanfor the participationof publichospitalsin a
        voluntaryprogramthat would converttheminto corporateentitiesoperating
        under the Commercial Code.       . The Government has developed a program to
        corporatize hospitals under commercial law. After a veto by the President in
        February 2009, and supported by a Cabinet Resolution, the original plan to make
        this change compulsory will be implemented as a voluntary change o f status. By
        May 2009, the voluntary program will open for business. Once corporatized,
        hospitals will follow commercial financial reporting requirements and will face
   .    the possibility o fbankruptcy ifthey cannot pay their bills.

        Adoption of DRGbased payments system for 90 percent of all payments
        fromNFZ to hospitals. A complement to the corporatization program will be to
        account for costs in hospitals and outpatient clinics using Diagnostically Related
        Groups, which gives the insurance system a tool for reimbursement that shifts
        from inputs to outputs and which has an in-built incentive structure to reduce
        costs and to standardize care against treatment guidelines for diagnostically
        related conditions. 2009 will be the first full year o f using DRGs to account for
        costs. In2009 and 2010 they will be analyzed and will start to affect tariffs paid
   .    byNFZ, the national insurer.

        Other elements of the reformprogramcomplementthese structural changes
        with similar efforts for hospitals that cannot participate in the corporatization
        program and initiatives to improve the quality o f care and evaluation o f programs
        inhealth.




                                            31

72.      In Social Protection- starting with contributory social insurance/pensions -
the Government has made substantial progress. To increase the long-term financial
sustainability o f the publicly financed part o f the pension system, the key prior action for
PL2 is:

         Enactment of the Law on Bridging Pensions reducing the number of people
         eligible for early retirement from 1.7 million to 300,000, while safeguarding
         the base level of pensions for persons affected by the change. This reform i s
         expected to increase the effective retirement age, increase participation in the
         labor market, and improve fiscal sustainability, while maintaining the base level
         o fpensions for those close to retirement age.

73.      The Government has made substantial efforts to secure passage of additional
legislation to strengthen the pension system but has faced political opposition. The
Government recognizes the importance o f making the disability/survivor benefit
consistent with the reformed first pillar old-age benefit. A draft law was presentedby the
Government and adopted by the Parliament, but it was vetoed by the President.
Similarly, an annuity law that defines the payout provisions for the lifetime pension from
the funded pillar (which was originally envisioned as a trigger for PL3) was presented
and adopted by the Parliament in December 2008, but this measure was also vetoed by
the President. The path forward for these measures is unclear at the moment given the
political obstacles. However, on both counts, while legislationwould be desirable now, it
i s not urgently needed, and it will not be essential until cohorts with a significant balance
o f accumulated savings in their private retirement accounts begin to retire in 2014.
MLSP estimates they have a 5-year window for a more favorable political environment to
submitthese reforms again.

74.      In social assistance, the single priority is to ensure that a responsive safety
net can meet greater needs anticipated in the wake of the economic crisis. The
Government, ledby the PMO, has taken the initiative on a number o f fronts to prepare for
increased vulnerability, as described in earlier sections. Reflecting the imperative to
prepare Poland's social assistance programs for the crisis, the key prior action taken by
the Government, supported byPL2 is:

        Provision of a reserve in the 2009 budget to protect households vulnerable to
        the crisis:    The higher levies on alcohol and luxury cars passed in 2008 are
        generating a PLN 1140 million reserve to address the needs o f households made
        vulnerable by the economic slowdown. The Government i s mapping the areas o f
        the country where households and workers are especially vulnerable to an
        economic downturn.

prior actions that were part ofthe loan agreement.

5.3. CONTINUATIONOFTHE REFORMPROGRAMDURING2009: TRIGGERS
FORPL3
(see Annex 2 Policy Matrix)

76.    The PMO, MOF, sector ministries,andthe Bankhavecome to a preliminary
agreement on the triggersfor the proposedthird policy loan(PL3). These measures
represent milestones in the Government's program that are expected to be completed by
the end of November 2009. Reaching these milestones would trigger the third policy
loan inthe program. The milestones and issues surrounding them are described briefly
below

77.    Public financial management. The trigger for PL3 is the approval of the 2010
budget consistent with the medium term fiscal consolidation, taking into account
assessments by the Bank, the IMF, and the EC. Inaddition, the Government is expected
to begin implementing the amendedLaw on Public Finance. The MOF has already taken
several steps to improve the quality ofbudget performance information. At the request of
the MOF, IMF experts reviewed the education function of the program classification in
early 2009.     Recently, the MOF commissioned external consultants to review and
evaluate an additional five functions. Based on this work, the MOF will revise the
performance information includedinthe budget documentation bythe end 2009.

78.    Despite the slowdownin economic growth, the Ministry of Economy(MOE)
continues its efforts to improve Poland's environmentfor doing business. The MOE
has taken on the task of further reforming the Government's business inspectionapparatus which
operates across ministries and affects whole sectors of private economic activity. Indiscussions
of the proposed third policy loan (PL3), the following actions are proposed as prior
    .
actions inthe area ofprivate sector development:

       Completion of background work and a draft Government strategy for
       "Rationalization of InspectionProcesses in Poland:" The most difficult and
       time consuming task - identification of overlapping inspection requirements in
       over 500 pieces o f legislation - has been completed. With additional technical
       assistance being discussedwith the Bank, the MOE will draw up a plan of action
       to rationalize business inspection process to further improve the environment for
    .  doing business.

        Appointment of a high-level inter-ministerial task force to review the
       strategy and prioritize actions for implementationof the reforms: The next
       step will be to reorganize government inspection and monitoring structures to
       reduce onerous, inconsistent, and repetitive procedures while retaining the
       legitimate purpose o f core inspection. As it touches on inspection regimes in
       almost all the ministries, implementation of the rationalization plan will require
       commitment from the Council of Ministers. The formation of a high level, inter-
       ministerial task force with a mandate to formulate a strategy and implement the
       rationalization planis an agreedkey action.




                                               34

     .
         Privatization program continues. Despite difficult conditions in the equity
         markets, the Government is moving ahead with its programof selling State shares
         in businesses.        If successful, there will be a large spike in revenue from
         privatizations in2009 and 2010 even though the number o f firms sold i s likely to
     .   decline.

         Continue business process simplification. Apart from the effort to simplify
         inspections, the Government has made substantial progress in simplifying the
         construction permit process while maintaining environmental protections and
         improving the basis for landuse planning at the local level.

79.      As the economy slows, the Governmentis preparingadditionallabor reforms
expected in the second half of 2009 that will mitigate the immediate effects of the
crisis, but just as importantly, they will support future employment when the
economy begins to recover. These measures include critical amendments to the labor
code to increase labor market adaptability, policies that use the Labor Fund to reduce
household vulnerability to the economic slowdown, and improvements in active labor
market programs (ALMPs)' The Labor Fundhas a substantial surplus - amassedduring
the recent periodo fhigheconomic growth andrelatively low unemployment - that can be
used proactively to face challenges posed by the economic slowdown.                                With some
important reservations, the Government's plans appear both prudent and farsighted given
the current economic uncertainty. The policies are aligned with the convergence agenda,
and with respect to employment, the Lisbon goals. Specific measures planned for the
     .
second halfo f 2009 that would be supported by PL3 include:

         Temporary legislation that will allow employers to redistribute working
         hours over a longer period: As a crisis measure, the Government is securing
         agreement with employers and trade unions to increase work-time flexibility to
         cushion the impact o f the crisis. The temporary measure would allow employers
         to redistribute working hours over a 12 month (rather than the current 3 month)
         period. The measure would encourage the labor market to adjust through working
         hours to discourage layoffs as the economy slows.12 This measure provides


l1The main active labor programs are: training; apprenticeships (on-the-job training) for school leavers;
wage subsidies; public works; and business start-up support. The regulatory framework for the provision
o f employment services (Law on the Promotion of Employment) is defined by the MLSP. The Ministry
allocates resources from the Labor Fundto districts (according to a pre-defined algorithm) to finance
programs, sets quality standards for employment services, and plays a coordinating role. The Ministry
intendsto improve the efficiency o femployment services by allowing greater competition inthe sector,
including the entry o fnon-public providers, public-private partnerships, and contracting out o f selected
services. The rationale for the reforms, including the introduction o f activation policies, is to increase the
currently low employment rates among certain groups (youth, low-skilled workers, older workers) and to
reduce the incidence o f long-term unemployment, which is relatively high despite the relatively low overall
unemployment rate.
''The  idea is to give employers the possibility to reduce work hours during periods o f low demand and
increase them duringperiods o fhigh demand, provided that the total number o f work hours within 12
months i s unchanged and the work week does not exceed48 hours. Moreover, employers are not required
to pay an overtime premiumas long as the total yearly amount o f work hours i s not exceeded. This
measure is meant to stabilize employment by allowing employers to adjust labor inputby adjusting work
hours rather than employment levels. Workers would face a lower risko fjob loss and unemployment


                                                      35

     .   workers and their households with additional tools with which to manage
         downturns inthe economic cycle.
         To prepare for the recovery, higher quality employment services:                              The
         authorities will develop a monitoring and evaluation system for active labor
         market programs implemented by local employment offices to ensure support i s
     .   givento programs that demonstrate a measurable positive impact.

         Liberalizingprovisionof employmentservices: Planned reforms will improve
         the efficiency o f public employment services by allowing services to be
         contracted-out to private providers.

80.      The Government'sreformsare expected to contributeto better labor market
performance - to better absorb the impact of the slowdown and prepare for
Poland's economic recovery.                The Bank team i s helping to estimate the cost
implications o f each measure and offer ideas for their design. For example, options being
considered for a "technical leave" scheme assume that workers would be paid the
minimumwage financed inequal proportionby employers andthe State (from the Labor
Fund).13 This may be too generous and too costly, requiring revenues o fthe Labor Fund
to be significantly increased, either by increasing the contribution rate (currently 0.1
percent o fpayroll), or by providing a subsidy from the national budget. Ineither case the
opportunity cost could be ~ubstantia1.l~There are other new labor market measures being
introduced as an "Anti-Crisis Package" agreed between employers and trade unions
within the Tripartite Socio-Economic Commission. Items in this package may incur
substantial costs for the Government and could hinder labor market performance (e.g. the
proposal to raise the minimumwage to 50 percent o f the average wage, from the current
level o f 37.3 percent). There i s a risk that items in the package being discussed could
create additional contingent liabilities and distortions that would worsen employment
outcomes and slow Poland's recovery.

81.      In education, the Governmentwill sustain the pace of measures to improve
performanceand equity. The steps agreed in discussion o f PL3 are aimed at ensuring
adequate financing o f the new programs for 5- and 6-year olds and improving the equity
o f higher education finance. The proposedprior actions ineducation policy for PL3 are:



duringthe period ofdownturn. Underthe proposedchange, for example, a worker could be puton2 month
leave during an economically slow period, then work 48 hours a week for the remaining 10 months. This is
a temporary measurethrough 2011and i s limitedto employers experiencing a fall inproduction or
revenues. Implementation o fthe measurerequires that a collective agreement is signedbetweenthe
employer and the enterprise's trade unions.
l3With the support o f labor unions and to help businesses manage the downturn at a lower social cost,
employers would be given the option to put workers on mandatory temporary leave (commonly referred to
as "technical leave") duringwhich employers pay reduced wages, andworkers' incomes are subsidized
from the Labor Fund. This is a measurebeing negotiated betweenemployers and labor unions
independently o fGovernment.
l4As part of its assistanceto the Government, the Bank team has beensuggesting alternatives to the MLSP
that could be proposed inthe current discussions between employers and labor unions. The Bank team and
its counterparts are monitoringthis dialogue closely, providing technical feedback where and when it i s
appropriate.

    .
       Adequate budget to finance educational programs for 5 and 6 year-olds
       enacted in 2008 and first implemented in 2009.             In the 2010 budget, the
       Government will fund the pre-school program fully. Financing will include
       preparatory activities by local governments for the forthcoming mandatory
       preschool program by supporting gminas to adopt diversified supply options
    .  includingnon-publicly managed institutions.

       Shift public resources for financing educationfinance toward students with
       greater material need. By September 2009, the Government expects to have
       reformed the student loan program so that students coming from poorer
       households will receive a higher proportion o f subsidies (without expanding the
       fiscal cost o f subsidies, but by targeting these resources). In addition, it will
       introduce legislationto shift a larger share of public stipends for tertiary education
       to a needsbasis, while reserving funds for performance prizes duringthe periodo f
       matriculation.

82.    In the healthsector, the Governmentwill continue its programof structural
reformsto improveefficiency.The measuresthat are planned, supported byPL3 are:

       Adequate budget proposedin 2010 to finance hospitalsto be liquidatedand
       corporatized through December 2010 (estimated to be approximately 80
       hospitals). Even though the voluntary program o f corporatization will begin in
       2009, it i s expected to take approximately 4-8 months to get a hospital to the stage
       of being corporatized. It would have to be liquidated first, its debts cleaned up,
       then resurrected as a corporation.      The process will require negotiation and
       agreement among many parties. Therefore, the MOF and MOH expect the major
       costs related to this program to begin in the 2010 budget. The success o f the
       process depends critically on its being fully budgeted to meet demand for the
    .  program.

       Managingother hospitals. Because the corporatization program is voluntary, it
       i s assumed that some o f the worst-off hospitals will not be able to participate.
       The M O H plans to develop a program to monitor them closely. In addition, a
       separate program for university-affiliated hospitals will need to be developed
       because they cannot legally participate in the corporatization program as it is
    .  currently set up.

       Accreditation and evaluation.          The MOH also proposes to develop its
       accreditation program, which will become a means to become more selective in
       contracting with provider organizations under NFZ. As part o f improved public
       sector management, the corporatization program will be evaluated annually and a
       report prepared for the Council o f Ministers.

83.    Looking beyond these lending operations, plans for multiple insurers to
replace NHZ and reform of Long Term Care are under development. The MOH
believes that introducing multiple insurers could open the system to additional
competition and choice for patients. However, such a change would also create risks; the



                                            37

MOH isjust at the beginning o f the analysis and design work necessary to develop these
options in this area. Financing options for long-term care (care o f the elderly and
immobile, LTC) are also being considered, but this policy area requires broad
consultation and cross-ministerial cooperation (the MOH, MLSP, MOF, and local
governments). The Government i s at an early stage inpublic discussions and formulation
o f options, making this i s an area where the Bank can add technical value although the
timingo factions isnot suitable for inclusion inthe current series o fpolicyloans.

84.       Inpensions policy the Government thinksthe time is right to pursue changes
to the privately managed funded pillar of the system to increase investment options
and lower management fees. Given the political obstacles to full enactment o f the
pensionreform measures passed by the Parliament, the Government has decided to focus
on improving the performance o f the private funded pillar. Looking ahead to PL3, the
following measures are agreed triggers:
     .
          Introduction of legislation allowing multiple portfolio options: Most countries
          in Central and Eastern Europe that introduced funded individual retirement
          savings pillars - including Slovakia, Hungary and Estonia - have allowed
          multiple portfolio options for workers' mandatory savings. Multiple portfolio
          options provide more instruments with which affiliates can manage financial risk
     .    as they approach retirement."

          Introduction of legislation to further reduce management fees:                             Poland's
          pension funds operate with relatively low administrative costs and fees. This
          outcome is due to centralizedrevenue collection arrangements and regulation that
          caps management fees. Total fees amount to 160 basis points on assets, which i s
          reasonable given the short period the funded pillar has been operating and the
          small volume o f assetsunder management. However, to increase the accumulated
          savings balances workers can rely on at retirement, and to safeguard the funded
          pillar from political threat, the Government plans hrther measures to reduce
          fees.l6



l5The portfolios o fPolish pension funds are not well diversified. A preponderance o f government bonds is
observed inthe pensionportfolios o f most countries that have recently introduced mandatory funded
pension systems (the secondpillar), although inPoland the funds have relatively larger holdings o f
domestic equity and investments inprivately-issuedfixed income instruments. The lack o f diversification
o f pension find portfolios reflects inpart some investment restrictions. The crisis and its impact on capital
markets reinforces the need to combine greater choice infunded private pensionpillars with better default
options for portfolio allocation. The multi-fundor "lifestyle model" was pioneered inChile at the
beginning o f the decade to give affiliated workers more options to manage financial risk as they
approached retirement. Proponents o f greater investment choices didnot expect low financial literacy to be
a barrier. Affiliates were slow to exercise their choices, those who did selected portfolios irrationally, and
once they chose a portfolio rarely changed their allocations. Lifecycle funds provide a better risk allocation
along the working life o f individuals. They alter the default "do nothing" portfolio allocation progressively
away fiom variable return securities to fixed return options as individuals get older. (Rudolph, H.and R.
Rocha, "Competition and Performance inthe Polish SecondPillar" mimeo). The Bank is advising the
authorities on the importance o f setting age-related default options as more investment choices are offered.
l6Fees on contributions are capped at 7 percent for all new contracts issued after 2004. This cap will be
progressively reduced to 3.5 percent inthe year 2014. All but one fundmanager currently charges the


                                                      38

85.      As partofthe AAA accompanyingthe program,the Bankteamis helpingthe
authorities to project the financial outlook for the public Notional Defined
Contribution,pay-as-you-go,pensionpillarunderdifferenteconomic scenarios. The
authorities report that the revenues o f the pension or social insurance system (ZUS) have
not been significantly affected by the economic slowdown although contributions have
been slightly lower than projected up to March 2009. The real impact o f the crisis can
only be evaluated at the end o fthe second quarter o fthe year. The Bank team is modeling
several different scenarios for the public N D C pension pillar, assuming different
developments in the economic outlook, to have a better understanding o f the short and
long-term financial ba1an~e.l~

86.      For social assistance, with an increasingly constrained fiscal envelope, the
Government's strategy is to use resources more effectivelyby improvingtargeting.
In2009, to increase the family benefit across the board under the regular 3-year benefit
adjustment cycle would cost approximately PLN 3 billion. However, in response to
budgetary pressures, the Government is preparing to allocate this adjustment more
efficiently by targeting it better. The core action inthis area that would serve as a trigger
     .
for the lendingprogram is:

         Council of Ministers decision to limit the scheduled increase in family
         benefitsto households with three or more children: Instead o f an across-the-
         board adjustment, the Government i s planning to spend only PLN 0.7 billion by
         targeting the adjustment infamily benefits to the poorest families - those with 3 or
         more children.

87.      In the area of social services for vulnerable groups, MLSP has noted an
increaseinthe number of childrenbeingleft infoster care. The Ministryexpects this
trend to continue as household incomes are put under strain. As a way to lower the cost
o f care and to improve social outcomes, the Ministryi s seeking to shift the system away
from institutional to household-based foster care. As a key prior action for PL3 to
improve foster care services, MLSP i s planning to:

         Present legislationthat shifts the provision of foster care from a primarily
         institutionalto a family-based model. The shift has a small up-front cost o f



maximum contribution fee. Fees on assets are capped according to the volume o fassets under management
(Rudolph, H.and R. Rocha, "Competition andPerformance inthe Polish SecondPillar" mimeo). The
Government is drafting legislation that would accelerate the pace o f fee reductions.
l7As discussedinarecent review bythe European Commission ofPoland's Convergence Programupdate,
the Government projects pension expenditure to drop from 12.6 percent o f GDP in2006 to 10.9 percent in
2010 to 9.6 percent in2020 and 8.3 percent in2050. This would be a substantial achievement o f the 1999
reform and follow-on measures, despite a rapidly aging population. This said, Polandi s one o fthe few EU
countries where the retirement age for menand women still differs (65 and 60 respectively). Possible
gradual leveling o fthe retirementage for men and women, combined with firther measuresto stimulate
employment and to reduce early retirementbenefits, could contribute to boosting labor participation among
women o f age 50+, currently one o f the lowest inEurope. (see European Commission Directorate General
OfEconomic And Financial Affairs, Brussels, 4 March 2009, ECFIN/G3(2009)Rep/50415-EN, "Poland:

         PLN 30 million but is expected to translate into considerable medium term
         financial savings, as well as betterquality care for abandonedorphaned children.

88.      Furthermore, the Bank's work with the Government on a Long Term Care
reforni will also have important implications for the delivery social care.                                As
discussed earlier, although not yet ready for support as part o f PL3, inthe context o f the
longer lending program, and keeping a focus on important structural reforms, the
Government i s conducting analysis o f LTC structures and outcomes in Poland and how
they compare with other countries inthe region. A team o f Bank specialists in this area
will contributeto this effort. The Bank's LTC staffhave engaged ina technical exchange
with the Senatorial Working Group examining reform options, chaired by Senate
Commission on Family and Social Policy. LTC reform i s a clear area where the Bank
can add considerable technical value, as well as draw benefit from an exchange with the
Government over the coming months.

89.      Linking employment and social assistance, the Government i s planning to
take a number of steps to support activation of long-term unemployed reducing
dependence on social assistance. The MLSP has presented plans to strengthening the
links between agencies administering active labor market programs and social assistance
to help recipients o f social assistance move back into the labor force. The Ministry i s
eager to improve the coordination between public employment services (which are under
district governments) and social assistance administered by the social welfare offices
(which are run by local governments). Better information sharing and coordination o f
benefits between employment and social assistance offices would improve client services
and encourage the movement o f people out o f long-term unemployment and social
assistanceand into the labor market.

5.4. CONSULTATIONPROCESS

91.      All legislative measures particularly social sector reforms in Poland are
                                           -                                                    -
subjected to a demandingconsultationprocesswith social partners and groups likely
to be impacted by particular proposed reforms. The consultation process i s an important
institutional feature of Poland's process o f government. The reforms supported by this
operation have been subject to extensive stakeholder consultations. For example, the
program Generational Solidarity 50+ was consulted with all stakeholders - trade unions,
employers' associations and local govenunent representatives as well as with other
institutions dealing with labor issues. Education and health reforms have beensubjected
to long periods o f consultation among all stakeholders as they have been developed and
before submission to Parliament. During consideration by Parliament, they have been
subjected to extensive coverage by the news media, public discussions, and hearings and
debate inParliament.

5.5. ANALYTICAL ANDADVISORY ASSISTANCE

92.      The Bank's analytical and advisory services can support the Government's
program. Currently a Bank team is preparing the first Public Expenditure Review for
Poland since 2003 and since the country's accession to the EU. This was a key element
inthe analytical assistance agreed inthe negotiation of the first lendingoperation. The
PER not only provides analytical support for the implementation of performance based
budgeting and the MTEF, but from extensive analysis o f the social sectors, lays the
technical foundations for the measures supported inPL2 and PL3.

93.      As part of the agreements reached for the second loan, several pieces of
technical assistance have been requested. To help the Government meet some of the
triggers for PL3 outlined inthe matrix inAnnex 2, the following technical assistance will
be provided by the Bank, financed through trust fundresources identified by the Country
Management Unit. The specific TA being discussed with the Government i s presented in
Table 8. It is unlikely that resources will be available to provide all of the inputs
requested o f the Bank.

                       VI. OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

6.1. POVERTYAND SOCIAL IMPACT

94.    Householddata available through 2007 show Poland's substantial strides in
lowering poverty. Even absolute poverty levels are considerably lower. Poverty -
measured as the percentageof population below the social assistance income threshold -
dropped from 19 percent in 2004 to 14.6 percent in 2007. The poverty gap also
narrowed, meaning that the incomes of the poor moved closer to those of the non-poor.
The main determinants of poverty in Poland include: rural residence, low educational
attainment of a household head, unemployment of a household member, and a large
number of children in the household. Table 9 shows the improvement in poverty
indicators from 2004 through 2007.

95.     Although not a reason for complacency, and while there is still room for
efficiency gains, poorer households are well served by the social protectionsystem.
The multiple elements o f Poland's social protection system (pensions, family benefits,
and social assistancetaken as a whole) cover 72 percent o f the population, and 85 percent
o f the poorest 10percent o f the population (according to HBS 2007 data). Reflecting the
geography o f Poland's poor areas, the social protection system covers 86 percent o f the
rural population at risk o f poverty - i.e. those who consume less than 60 percent of
median consumption by EU convention (as compared to 82 percent o f the urban
population inthe same category o f consumption).

96.     The measures being supported by the second operation in the program are
expectedto have a substantialandbeneficialimpact reducingpovertyby improving
services inthe mediumand longterm, whileprotectingvulnerablehouseholdsin the
immediateterm. The Government's "50+ Program" improves the labor market options
o f older people by reducing the costs o f employing workers who are close to the
retirement age. It ensures that public employment services are available to active people
aged 45 and older to help them remain in the labor force longer. Indesigningthe fiscal
savings measure that reduces the number o f people eligible for early retirement (from 1.7
million to 300,000) the Government included important safety net safeguards that protect
the base level pension benefits received by households affected by the reform.             By
initiating measures that lower the age at which formal education begins, the Government
expects to give children a head start to achieve better learning performance and education
outcomes.      After a short period during which the new education structures will be
voluntary, they will be made mandatory to ensure the benefits o f earlier instruction
accrue to all children, including those from lower-income households.            Finally, the
expected revenue from the new taxes on alcohol, tobacco products and luxury cars, will
give the Government extraresources withwhich to target supplementary social assistance
as the current crisis unfolds.

97.     As the program proceeds to the third lending operation, further positive
social impact is expected, particularlyin the short term to mitigatethe crisis. First,
the program supports measures that increase working time flexibility, as part o f the "anti-


                                             43

 crisis package" agreed by the social partners. The measures will be in place until 2011,
 will cover enterprises which are experiencing sharp falls in production due to the
 economic crisis, and are expected to discourage lay-offs. Second, the program supports
 reforms to the unemployment benefit system that increase the total amount o f benefits,
 but also introducebenefit reductions after three months o fjob search. These changes are
 expected to improve the efficiency o f the system by strengthening labor supply incentives
 while providing the unemployed with better income support. The program also includes
 reforms that shift the structure o f Government subsidies for higher education financing
 hrther away from purely merit based criteria and toward greater consideration o f
 household means. In doing so, the Government expects to lower the percentage o f
 applicants for student loans whose applications are rejected for insufficient collateral
 guarantees, from over 10percent to 8 percent by the endo f 2010. Finally, andwith direct
 impact on the poorest and most vulnerable households, the Government plans to target
 the triennial adjustment o f family benefits to recipients with three or more children.
 Given the close correlation between the number o f dependent children and poverty (see
 Table lo), this targeted adjustment i s expected to redistribute between 0.4 and 1
 percentage point o f spending on family benefits from non-poor to poor households
 (dependingon the size o f the adjustment, still to be determined), and to reduce the share
 o f families with 3 or more children who are poor, by between 1.3 to 3.4 percentage
 points.18

98.       The Government's growing concern is for the flow of newly vulnerable
households into poverty in the wake of slowing economic growth. Facing the
economic crisis the Government is planning targeted regional interventions to support
powiats that are most affected by the drop ineconomic activity. There are 379powiats in
Poland and they are each considered a local labor market. The Government i s planning
to strengthen local capacity to weather the crisis, by both improving the effectiveness o f

          targeted benefit adjustments have been simulatedfor households who inthe 2007 H B S and who

existing programs (employment and social assistance programs) and if eventually
necessary, by allocating additional resources and implementing extraordinaryprograms.

99.      As discussed earlier, the PMO is leading efforts to map vulnerability to the
crisis in order to eventuallytarget interventions. This initiative has three components
and will be implemented in three corresponding stages. The first component i s the
creation o f a regional "crisis vulnerability" map to identifypowiats that are at highest risk
o f suffering from the current global economic crisis. The second i s the implementation
o f a monitoring system that will screen powiats that are actually hit by the crisis. The
final component i s the creation o f an agency with a mandate to support to worst affected
powiats. The initiative will be ready by September 2009. As shown in Box 2, by
definition, the regions that are considered the most vulnerable to short-term dislocations
are the also those with an export-oriented economy, rather than the poor, lagging regions.
The latter - rural, predominantly agricultural region - are insulated from the crisis, at
least temporarily, and well covered by existing social protectionprograms.

100.     The Governmentwill monitor the crisis' impact by tracking a large number
of indicators. Leading indicators include changes in tax revenues, social security
payments, inflows into unemployment and outflows fiom unemployment to jobs.
Lagging indicators include changes in the unemployment rate, the number o f social
assistance recipients, and the number o f contributors to the social security system. The
data will be compiled, processed and analyzed by a special regional monitoring unit
under the PMO. The Government plans to have the monitoring system operational by the
endo fJune.

101.     The Governmentis consideringa new agency to representits crisis initiative
at the local level. The role o f the agency will be to determine and recommend ways to
support thepowiats most affected by the crisis. This could include strengthening existing
institutions and mechanisms, as well as designing and implementing new special
programs financed from government reserves and extraordinary funds. The mandate o f
the new agency would include negotiating and signing contracts with powiat
governments to implement special programs. The Government expects the agency to be
created and ready to operate by the end o f September 2009. This crisis initiative is
tentatively planned to last for two years. However, if it proves to be an effective means
o f strengthening local capacity to respond to regional economic shocks then it may
become institutionalizedon a permanent basis.

6.2. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

102.    The specific policiessupported by the second policy loanin the programare
not likely to have significant effects on Poland's environment, forests, and other
natural resources. Unanticipated and unintended risks o f adverse effects to the
environment and natural resources are minor, although acknowledged. However, Poland
has adequate environmental controls in place. Poland's environmental legislation and
regulation i s reinforcedby EUenvironmental directives, including the EU's guidelines on
adoption o f environmental assessments at the planning and programming level (June
2001) and the EU's Environmental Liabilities Directive settingout liability for damage to



                                               45

properties and natural resources (April 2007). Pre-privatization environmental audits are
required to determine the existence and scope o f any liabilities of companies in state
hands, manifestedas contamination on realproperty or other conduits. The quantification
of such liabilities is then used as part o f the overall valuation of the state enterprise for
purposes o f negotiating a fair purchase price with the private party. Private sector bidders
o f enterprises will be subject to the environmental provisions embodied inPolish and EU
law once they acquire previous state assets inthe process o f ownership transfer.

6.3. IMPLEMENTATIONMONITORINGANDEVALUATION

 103.    The Bank continues to work closely with the MOF, PMO and sector
Ministriesto monitor and assess reformprogressand impactsduring the course of
the program. Monitoring and evaluation will be supported by the various Ministries as
well as budgetary, legislative and economic data provided by the authorities and verified
inofficial disclosures, directives andregulations. Baseline andupdated data areprovided
by the respective specialized agencies for the pertinent functions and tracked according to
the indicators and outcome measures as shown in the Monitoring and Results
Framework.

6.4. FIDUCIARYASPECTSAND PROCUREMENT

 104.    The fiduciary risk to this operation arising from Poland's public financial
management system and use of budget resources is low. As part o f its accession
process to the EU, Poland has achieved significant progress in reforming its public
financial management system (PFM).19 It has upgraded its legislative framework, inline
with the EU acquis, introduced an internal audit function, and prepared for the EU
accreditation process o f fund-managing agencies. Poland has also made significant
improvements related to the public availability and coverage o f fiscal information,
particularly the adequacy o f accounting and reporting standards and regularity o f
reconciliations o fbank accounts.

105.    The PFM reform agenda supported by this program will enhance budget
transparency, predictability and performance-orientationover the medium term.
The proposed amended Law on Public Finance, expected to be adopted in2009, enhances
budget transparency,predictability and performance-orientation over the medium term.
It introduces performance-oriented multi-year budget planning, integration o f remaining
ExtraBudgetary Fundsand externally-financed expenditures within the State Budget, and
strengthened internal control over public expenditures and debt via new regulations on
internal audit and internal control. These measures, if adequately implemented, will
result in significant progress in the country public financial management. However, one
of the mainchallenges is implementationo f the proposed reforms on the operational level
as most of the detailed procedures need to be defined and applied in practice.
Furthermore, to achieve expected results o f the reform, the introduction o f performance
budgeting should be supported by additional changes in the financial control framework


l 9The status o f the PFM was derived from the World Bank's ongoing monitoring o f PFM reform and
previous diagnostic works conducted by the Bank and external organizations.

including accountability, updated and compatible budget classification, accounting and
reporting systems, and an integrated financial management information system.

106.    Other areas of ongoing reform include cash management. This includes the
introduction o f a single treasury account (TSA) system, computerization o f all cash
transactions and central monitoring o f commitments and liabilities. The State Budget
TREZOR computerized system includes the 1st and 2nd tier State budget holders, with
the remaining units to be included in the final stage. In 2005, the TREZOR system
gained an ability to communicate with the National Bank o f Poland's accounting system,
allowing direct coordination o f pending payment orders and State Budget cash
availability, improving internal controls.

107.    Inthe area of external audit, Poland is advanced inrelation to availability of the
audit reports to the public, independence o f the Supreme Audit Institution (NIK)from the
executive, and control o f the NIK budget, providing a well functioning public financial
accountability and assurance mechanism for the legislature and the public.

108.    The National Bank of Poland is part of the European System of Central
Banks,andit has upgradeditsaccountingand reportingpoliciesin accordance with
the guidelinesof the EuropeanCentralBank. Its financial management and operations
are transparently disclosed and presented on its website. The NBP's annual financial
statements are regularly audited. The most recently available audit reports (for 2004-
2008) have unqualified audit opinions and were approved by the Council o f Ministers.
Overall, the fiduciary risk to this operation arising from Poland's public financial
management system anduse of budget resources and its foreign exchange environment as
controlled by the Central Bank i s low.

109.    Finally, Poland has made significant progress in reforming its public
procurementsystem. Adoption o f a new law inJanuary 2004 made Poland a pioneer in
Central and Eastern Europe in settingup a sound public procurement system that met the
requirements o f the EU. InApril 2006 and April 2007 the Public Procurement Law was
further amended to implement the provisions o f the EU directives 2004/18/EC and
2004/17/EC, on the (i)coordination o f procurement procedures for the award o f public
works, supply, and service contracts and (ii)coordination o f procedures o f entities
operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors.          The latest
amendment to the Public Procurement Law entered into force in October 2008 to adjust
the Law to EC directives but also to enhance and streamline the implementation o f
procurement procedures,        Improvements and hrther simplifications o f the public
procurement system were also a result o f the development and upgrading o f e-
government procurement tools. Other areas o f ongoing reform relate to: (i)  increasingthe
effectiveness o f public expenditures;       (ii)strengthening competition in public
procurement; (iii)  facilitating access o f SMEs as bidders; (iv) improving the quality o f
procured goods, works, and services; and (v) promoting innovative and ecological
solutions inpublic procurement.

6.5. DISBURSEMENTANDAUDITING

 110.   As with the first loanin the program, loanproceeds will be disbursedin one
single tranche to the foreigncurrencynationalbudget account at the NationalBank
of Poland (Central Bank). Disbursement will be made upon declaration o f loan
effectiveness and submission o f a withdrawal application to IBRD.At the request o f the
MOF, IBRD will deposit the proceeds o f the loan into the foreign currency national
budget account indicated by the Government that forms part o f the budget management
system o f the country. The proposed loan will follow the Bank's disbursement
procedures for development policy lending. Disbursements will not be linkedto specific
purchases, thus no procurement requirements will be necessary. The Government shall
maintain accounts and records with respect to the deposit o f loan proceeds inthe NBP. If
the loan proceeds are used for ineligible purposes as defined inthe loan agreement, IBRD
will require the borrower to refundthe amount directly to IBRD.

 111. No additional fiduciary arrangements will be required. The Bank will not
require an audit o f the Deposit account but will require the Government to provide
confirmation to the Bank inthe form o f an official letter from the Ministryo f Finance on
the amounts deposited in the foreign currency account within 30 days o f receiving the
funds.

                     VII. RISKS AND RISKMITIGATION

 112.   The medium-termmacroeconomic scenario of slowing economic growth and
moderatinginflationis subject to further downsiderisks.While inflationary pressures
have abated significantly with the recent global slowdown and tighter credit conditions as
well as moderation o f wage pressure, the depreciation o f the zloty could rekindle
inflationary pressures. Poland has one o f the most solid financial systems in Europe, but
the interbank market continues to experience problems due to lack o f confidence. The
authorities may need to respond with additional confidence-restoring and liquidity-
enhancing measures. In the context o f the Euro adoption agenda requiring fiscal
discipline, the supply side o f the economy needs to be firther stimulated through
acceleration o f structural reforms. While the exogenous risk cannot be mitigated, one
option is for the Bank to scale up its lending operations ifthe risk materialized.

 113.   The deterioration of Poland's economic outlook raises fiscal risks to the
program. Although the assumptions on which the 2009 budget and Convergence
Program are based are clearly outdated, and the Government has exercised good
judgment inimplementinginformal savings measures, a formal revision to the budget has
not yet been announced. This could pose a fiscal risk to the measures beingsupported by
this loan. However, as a condition o feffectiveness, the Governmenthas agreedto initiate
the process o f revising its 2009 budget in form and substance consistent with the
measures being supported by the program, to ensure continued compliance with the first
prior action o f this loan.     In addition, the third loan in this series will provide
opportunities to engage with the authorities inthe development o f the 2010 budget.




                                             48

114.    Poland's external and financial vulnerability may be further affected by
global and regional developments. Recent developments demonstrate the risk of
contagion from other countries in the region, and access to external financing sources
may become more difficult and more expensive. Enteringthe ERM2 during significant
volatility on global financial markets poses risks for exchange rate stability as requiredby
the relevant Maastricht criterion over a minimum two-year period. At the same time,
there i s risk o f a misaligned EUR/PLN central parity in ERM2 and during the ultimate
conversion rate from zloty into euro. On the other hand, the Government's commitment
to euro adoption lends credibility to fiscal policy and may help preserve confidence in a
very difficult external environment, even ifthe current economic circumstances force the
exact date o f entry into the single currency to be reconsidered.

115.    The projected deterioration of economic prospects may undermine social
support for the Government and reduce its willingness to push for additional
structuralreforms.Reformmomentum is already constrained bythe risk o fPresidential
veto on new legislation passed in Parliament, in particular in the area o f social services.
Inthis context, there is a risk of general elections earlier than scheduled for fall 2011.
This may be provoked, for example, by internal tensions inthe governing Civic Platform
and in the coalition if Prime Minister Tusk decides to run for President in 2010. The
Government's lack o f a constitutional majority in Parliament and elusive compromise
with the opposition Pis, which demands a referendum on euro adoption, could
complicate the euro adoption plan and aggravate risks related to the ERM2 transition
period.

ANNEX4: ASSESSMENTFROMINTERNATIONALMONETARYFUND

On May 6, 2009, the IMF's Board approved a Flexible Credit Line for Poland in the
amount of US$20.58 billion. The Board made its decision with reference to the Staff
Report "Arrangement under a Flexible Credit Line" prepared by the Fund's European
Department in consultation with other departments. The Staff Report was completed on
April 24,2009. Section Iof the StaffReport is provided inthis Annex, and includesthe
Fund's assessment andoutlook for Poland.

(Table 1).Private consumption growth has also beenrobust, driven by rapidlyrisingreal
wages. increasing employment. and record-high credit growth. The output response reflected
primarilya significant increase inlabor utilization. altlioiigh risinginvestmentand
producti\ity also played a role. Emerging capcity constraints, not least inthe labor market,
hadcaused some moderate weakening of output growtheven before the global crisis beganto

downturn:monettuypolicyhas beeneasing: financial sectorsurveillance has intensified,

      0    Financialsector. The Polish authorities have beenactively safeguarding financial
           sector stability (Box 1). Notably, to increase domestic liquidity the NBP has
           arrangeddollar, Swiss franc, aiideuro swaps, widened the list o fcollateral that

           adoptiontimetable, the nuthoiitiesremaindetermined to ensurethat the state
           budget deficit does iiot exceedthe budpet limit o f zl.18.2 billion hi2009-even
           thought h y foreseeGDP growth to be sietllfcantly weaker thanassumed inthe
           budget. They intend to achieve this primarilybycutting expenditure at the state
           level. While the deficit ofthe general goveiment will remainabove 3 percent o f
           GDP in2009,111part becauseofIiplierdeficits at lower levels o fgovemient,
           these pro-cyclical expenditure cuts at the state levelwill sipificantlylimit the
           extent to which automatic stabilizeis are at play. Ths, at the ctuxeutjumctwe, the
           authorities' concern about the negative implications o fa Iidier nominaldeficit
           for borrowingcosts andtheir euro adoptiontimetable are outweighing the benefits
           of allowinga strongcoiuiter-cyclical impact though automatic stabilizers.

                                         E. Outlook

9.      NotwithstandingPoland's solidfundamentalsand soundpolicyresponse, the
intensificationof adverse spilloverswillweigh on the outlook.The authorities are likelyto
reduce fiuther their forecast for realGDP growth in2009: intheir View, the economy is
projectedto continue to expand this year, although at a very slow pace. They take confidence
fromthe still robustgrowthindomestic consumption evident inearly 2009. StaPs baseline
projectionenvisages a somewhat sharper slowdown ineconomic activity, with growth falliug
fiomabout 4%percent in2008 to about -%percent in2009, reflectinglessfavorable
assumptions about growth inmainexport markets andthe view that domestic demand growth
is set to slownotably from its current pace. The projectedrecovery o fgrowthto about
1%percent in2010 h g e s onthe realizationo fcunmt WE0 assirmptions.

10.     Inflationis set to fall further. As world oilpriceshaveM e nandwage
developments havetracked realactivity. price pressureshave easedmarkedlysince last
sumner.despite the sharp zloty depreciation. Withgrowthwell belowpotential, inflationis
projectedto remainw i t h its tolerance range for the foreseeable fiilure.

11.     The balanceofpaymentsis expectedto continueto befinanced through accessto
financial marketswithout unduepressureson the zloty. Declininghportvolumes and
firvorable t e r m oftrade developments-weakening comnodity prices, notably oil prices-
will more thanoffset a projected decline inexports and the ciurent account positionis set to

continue to satisfy its financingneedsthrough &et      borrowing.

12.     Risksto thebankingsectorhaveincreased,butare expectedto remain
manageable.Recent data suggest that bankswill remainprofitable, with solvency ratios that
are declining.but will remain at comfortable levels in2009. The zloty depreciation has
promptedthe authorities to revisitforeign current risksinthe bankingsector thou$ its
hlance sheet impact oncorpoiates andhouseholds. Onthe corporate side. there have been
soue concerns regardingFXoptions that were contracted whenthe zloty was strong. The
vast majority o fthese derivatives have been foundto be associatedwith export hedging.;only
a smallportionwas overhedged becauseexport demandprojections haveprovenoptimistic.
