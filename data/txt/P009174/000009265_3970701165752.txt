PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA - AGRICULTURE AND AGROINDUSTRIES II PROJECT - MACEDONIA
(LOAN 1371-YU)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) of the Agriculture and
Agroindustries II - Macedonia Project, for which Loan 1371-YU in the amount
of US$24.00 million was approved on February 22, 1977. The original closing
date was June 30, 1982. The closing date was extended to June 30, 1983. The
final disbursement was made on January 18, 1984 and the remaining balance of
US$2.34 million was cancelled. The project is the fifth Bank loan for agri-
culture and agroindustries in Yugoslavia and was prepared by Stopanska Banka
Skopje. It was followed by the Macedonia Agriculture III Project (2039-YU)
which was approved on July 14, 1981.
This PCR was prepared by the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
Regional Office following a mission to Yugoslavia from February 5 through 13,
1985, and is based in part on a draft Project Completion Report prepared by
the Borrower (Stopanska Banka Skopje), a review of the Staff Appraisal Report
(No. 1316a-YU), the President's Report (No. 1943a-YU), the Loan and Guarantee
Agreements dated March 10, 1977; a review of relevant Bank files, including
correspondence with the Borrower, internal Bank memoranda on project mis-
sions, minutes of the Board's discussions,   Bank supervision reports, quar-
terly project progress reports prepared by the Borrower, as well as inter-
views with officials both in the Bank and in Yugoslavia who have been asso-
ciated with the project.
A copy of the draft report was sent to the Borrower on October 10,
1985. A statement received from Stopanska Banka-Udruzena banka is in Annex
c.
This project has not been subjected to an audit by OED.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
YUGOSLAVIA - AGRICULTURE AND AGROINDUSTRIES II PROJECT - MACEDONIA
(LOAN 1371-YU)
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
The project represented the fifth Bank operation principally
involved with the agriculture sector in Yugoslavia and the third supporting
agroindustries;  it was  the  second  in this subsector  in  Macedonia.    It
responded to opportunities for development of production in the individual
sector and to the perceived need to expand agro-processing capacity in the
social sector.
Objectives
The project was to provide credit to support Macedonia's long-term
objectives of self-sufficiency in and increased exports of agricultural pro-
duction.  It was to make funds available through Stopanska Banka of Skopje
(SBS) for credits to six social sector enterprises and some 910 individual
sector farmers for investments in agricultural processing facilities and pri-
mary production. Processing investments were to include cold storage, vege-
table and fruit processing, tobacco drying, dairying and slaughtering facili-
ties; in primary production the project was to finance the establishment of
vineyard and fruit plantations, as well as investments in livestock, plastic
greenhouses for vegetable production, and on-farm mechanization. The project
also aimed at strengthening the organization and appraisal and supervision
capacity of SBS.
Implementation Experience
Project implementation was expected to begin in 1977 and to be com-
pleted by mid 1982; however, delays in procurement and construction of the
processing facilities caused an extension of the closing date by one year.
All construction was completed by late 1983. Processing plants had been ope-
rational for one year at the time of the PCR mission with the exception of
the dairy plant, which was not yet operating because of lack of a source of
energy. The individual sector component was completed in time and the demand
for on-farm development satisfied. At completion, total project cost amount-
ed to US$50 million, representing a reduction of about 11% from US$56 million
estimated at appraisal. The dinar devaluation of about 460% between 1977 and
1983 compared to a domestic inflation rate of about 370% over the same period
caused the reduction of project cost in US dollar terms. In dinar terms the
total project cost was about 1002 higher than estimated at appraisal because
project components were carried out two to four years later than anticipated
and inflation during the entire period was considerably higher than projected
at appraisal. Such difficulties could not be foreseen at appraisal.



- iv -
Results
Most of the production targets of the subprojects in the individual
sector component appear to have been met.   Vegetable and wheat production
exceeded eppraisal estimates because of more farm mechanization than expected
while orchard production was lower than expected. Beneficiaries of the proj-
ect include the approximately 1,800 farm families who received sub-loans
through the project plus the 500 full-time employees in the social sector.
Foreign exchange earnings are estimated for 1985 at about US$13 million
equivalent and this represents a significant increase in exports for the
Republic of Macedonia. The re-estimated economic rate of return of the proj-
ect is 15% against the appraisal estimate of 26%. This reduction is due to
delays in investment and the increase in input prices relative to the
increases in output prices.
All the agroindustries financed under the loan face financial prob-
lems. With the exception of one, the plants have been able to cover their
operating costs in 1984.   However, they could not repay the interest and
principal on loans and they have all requested rescheduling of their debts.
The financial difficulties stem from two sources:  rapid devaluation of the
dinar in a situation where the plants carry the foreign exchange risk on the
World Bank-financed portion of their subloans and markets which do not offer
prices sufficient to cover their debt servicing.   All the plants need addi-
tional financing to cover their cash flow deficits at the same time that they
must improve financial planning and develop improved marketing strategies.
Sustainability
The main uncertainties facing the project relate to developments in
prices and markets.  With current relative input-output prices, most agro-
industries would suffer long-term financial difficulties. Markets need to be
explored and developed, under appropriate marketing strategies, in order to
maximize capacity utilization of plants  and revenues.   One major factor
determining the industries' financial viability is the future performance of
the country's relatively depressed economy.
Findings and Lessons
A number of revisions were made in the design of project
facilities, most of which, but not all, with the Bank's approval (paras.
3.05-3.09). Procurement problems, resulting from inexperience of local staff
and late changes in designs by investors. caused implementation delays
(paras. 3.11, 3.21-3.23). A mcnitoring and evaluation system was established
by Stopanska Banka. While some useful monitoring activities were undertaken,
the experience with the evaluation function was disappointing (paras. 3.30
and 7.01-7.02).   Marketing efforts in support of project activities were
inadequate (paras. 4.18-4.20).
The project adversely affected the Borrower's financial position,
and the financial performance of sub-borrowers in the social sector was poor
(paras. 5.01 and 5.12-5.14).   One of the most important lessons learned is



the need for financial discipline with respect to establishing and maintain-
ing prudent capital structures for the investments and for the sub-borrow-
ers.  Guidelines as foreseen in the loan documents for equity contribution
and cashflow requirements need to be monitored and respected throughout the
project period.  Any future Bank investment in agroindustries in Macedonia
should be preceded by a portfolio review by SBS of its agroindustrial sub-
borrowers to come up with a program outlining actions to improve performance
(procurement, processing, management and marketing) and realistic estimates
of long-term financial viability (paras. 3.27-3.29, 5.05, 7.08 and 8.02-
8.03). In addition, any future Bank involvement with the Borrower should be
preceded by a review of its internal procedures for managing its portfolio
and should be based on a program to improve its portfolio management (para.
8.04).
The individual sector farmers clearly responded to project
opportunities.   Mechanization investments produced  the highest financial
returns and attracted the most interest among private farmers (paras. 3.18,
5.10-5.11). Given the importance of the individual sector and its relatively
low level of productivity, considerable potential still exists for further,
development.  This could be done through improvement of infrastructure and
irrigation, land reclamation, and greater availability of credit (para.
8.06).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. Introduction
Agricultural Sector in Macedonia
The Yugoslav Economy
1.01     Despite an impressive record of economic and social development
since World War II, Yugoslavia over the past five or six years has faced a
difficult economic situation. The repercussions of the 1979 oil shock are
still being felt today. Inflation has increased from 22% in 1979 to 55%
in 1983 and 60% in 1984. Agricultural and industrial production declined,
merchandise exports dropped and the international debt grew to US$19.0
billion. The value of the dinar, which had been stable since 1971 at
US$1.0 = 17-19 dinars through 1979, fell rapidly to US$1.0 = 50 dinars in
1982 and 124 dinars by 1984. As of February 1985 the value was US$1 = 220
dinars. The deteriorating economic situation caused the Government to
introduce in 1982 a series of stabilization measures including restrictive
monetary and fiscal policies, promotion of exports, efforts to curb
imports and strengthening social sector operations. It was in this
economic environment that the Second Agriculture and Agroindustries
Project was implemented, between 1977 and 1983.
1.02     The Socialist Republic of Macedonia (SRM) is located in
southeastern Yugoslavia. With a 1982 per capita income of US$1,875, or
about 67% of the national average, it is one of the less developed areas
of Yugoslavia. The active agricultural labor force has decreased since
1966 at a rate of about 1.5% per year, while agricultural production has
increased at about 4Z annually. Fruit and vegetable production grew most
rapidly, encouraged by rising relative prices and improved technology and
irrigation, especially in the social sector. Agricultural production in
the social sector grew at about 7% per year between 1971-1980, compared to
about 2n in the individual sector.- This is because of higher
investment, greater use of modern technology, possession of better quality
and irrigated land and better availability of skilled manpower. Almost
75% of the cultivable land and 90% of the livestock in SRM are, however,
1/ The individual sector in agriculture consists of farmers who farm
their own land as opposed to those who are members of basic
organizations which farm socially owned lands. Individual secto.-
farmers may enter into production/marketing contracts with the social
sector, by which they receive inputs in exchange for a guarantee of
sale of their produce; or they may not enter into such contracts.
Those who do are "associated" farmers. Under this project, all
individual sector beneficiaries were associated farmers. About 15% of
project cost involved the individual sector.

owned by the individual sector. In 1980, agriculture, excluding
agroindustries, contributed about 171 of gross national product (GNP) in SRM
and absorbed about 341 of the active population. It contributed about 7% to
Yugoslavia's total agricultural production. In spite of the growth in
agriculture and agricultural activity since 1966, the relative share of
agriculture in GMP has steadily decreased because of the faster growth in
other sectors of the economy.l/ In addition, unemployment in Macedonia was
estimated in 1974 to be about 86,000 people.
1.03     Out of a total area of 2.6 million hectares in SRM, about 251, or
655,000 ha, are arable. About 550,000 ha are cultivated and as of 1976
roughly 65,000 ha were irrigated. Irrigation potential is considerable
however and could cover the entire arable area.
1.04     The Agriculture and Agroindustries II Project, Macedonia (Loan
1371-YU), was the fifth Bank loan for agriculture in Yugoslavia-' and the
second Bank loan to Macedonia for development of agriculture and
agroindustries. The objectives of the second project were to continue to
expand primary production, particularly in the individual sector, and to
modernize and expand food processing capacity in SRM, both for domestic
production and for export.-  These objectives were consistent with those of
previous and ongoing projects to remove constraints to individual sector
agricultural performance through the provision of credit and of market outlets
for the production and to improve the productivity of the agroindustrial
subsector.
1.05     At the time of appraisal, in mid-1976, the economy of Yugoslavia had
been growing at a rate of 6Z per year, per capita incomes in SRM were
increasing at 41 per year, tourism and urbanization were on the rise, domestic
inflation was projected at 10-12Z and the dinar had been stable at 17-18
dinars = US$1.0 since 1971. With a healthy market demand expected for both
the fresh and processed production, the investments were judged to be
financially viable and economically sound, and the social sector investors
took the foreign exchange risk on their subloans.
II. Project Formulation and Processing
A. Project Background
2.01     The Bank by 1973 had made 32 loans totaling about US$1,021 million to
Yugoslavia. The Bank lending was generally conce-itrated on infrastructure
I/ In the early 1970s, agriculture employed about 471 of the active
population and contributed about 30% of the Republic's GMP.
2/ Previous Bank loans in agriculture were:
Loan 894-YU - Agricultural Industries Project, 1973
Loan 1129-YU - First Agricultural Credit Project, 1975
Loan 1360-YU - Metohija Multipurpose Project, 1976
Loan 1370-YU - Agriculture and Agro-Industries Project-Montenegro, 1977.
3/ Most of the primary production - milk, grapes, tomatoes from greenhouses
-was for domestic consumption and most of the agroindustries' output
(except for dairy products and beef and mutton) - spring lamb, dried and
processed fruits and vegetables - was for export.

projects, including transportation, power, telecommunications, and
multipurpose projects, which included agricultural components for irrigation
and agricultural credit. Nine loans had been made for industry, two for
tourism, and one for agricultural industries in Macedonia. The Bank was alao
prQvivling technical assistance to Yugoslavia in several areas.
B. Identification
2.02     In June 1973 the Federal Secretary of Finance submitted a list of
projects for the Bank's consideration. The list included agroindustrial
proposals in the less developed regions of Kosovo, Bosnia Herzegovina,
Montenegro and Macedonia. The proposals formed the basis of the preparation
for a follow-up project to the Agricultural Industries Project (Loan 894-YU)
in Macedonia.
2.03     On the basis of feasibility studies prepared by several Basic
Organizations of Associated Labor (BOALs) the Department of Agriculture of
Stopanska Banka Skopje (SBS) prepared, in April 1976, a preliminary report on
the Agroindustrial Project "Macedonia" phase 1I. The list of projects
included primary production (two pig fattening farms, and 23 fruit production
subprojects, 1,000 ha vineyards and 1,000 ha orchards) and seven processing
facilities (for fruits, vegetables, potatos, milk, tobacco, and meat) in the
social sector and primary production (livestock, off-season vegetable,
orchards and vineyards) as well as mechanization in the individual sector.
The Project was reviewed by the concerned BOALs. SBS informed them of IBRD
general loan conditions and also proposed the project to the Federal
Secretariat of Finance for their agreement.
C. Appraisal
2.04     In May/June 1976, the Bank appraised the Project in conjunction with
the appraisal of Agriculture and Agricultural Industries Project Montenegro
(Loan 1370-YU)- SBS, the Borrower, presented some thirty subprojects in the
social and about as many subprojects in the individual sector, at a total
project cost of US$79.5 million. The mission, after appropriate analyses,'
recommended: inclusion of six of the agroindustrial proposals, with the
potato processing plant to be replaced by a potato cold store and the addition
of four tobacco driers to be financed in the individual sector. Tne mission
agreed to include credit to the individual sector for the development of
vineyards, orchards, off-season vegetable, on-farm mechanization and livestock
development and financing of an irrigation study as follow up to the study
under Loan 894-YU. Total Project cost was estimated to be US$56.0 million.
The Republic of Macedonia conveyed to the appraisal mission its disappointment
at the sn.qller project size and the proposed Bank contribution of only US$15
million.
1/ Including, in particular, market considerations, and availability of raw
material supply.



-4-
2.05     The only important issue in the issues/decision process was interest
rates. The mission recommended a uniform interest rate structure for
on-lending under the proposed sub-projects while the existing rates in
Macedonia varied between 3Z and 8Z depending on the purpose of the loan and
the source of funds for lending with most of the lending done at 5-6%.  Under
the Maccionia Agricultural Industries Project (Lean 894-YU, approved in 1973)
agreement was reached on a uniform onlending interest rate of 8.25X for both
IBRD and local funds. However, under the First Agricultural Credit Project
(Loan 1129-YU, approved in 1975) and the Second Industrial Credit Project
(Loan 1277-YU, approved in 1976) only the interest rate charged on Bank funds
was fixed; the prevailing domestic rates, different for certain activities and
for differfvnt sources, were accepted by the Bank. In addition, the exchange
risk fur lending to the social sector was passed on to the social sector
subborrowers; for the individual sector under Loan 1129-YU, it was assumed by
the Government.
2.06     The estimated average financial blend cost of local funds to the
banks was 5X. Assuming the cost of IBRD funds at 8.85Z, the blend cost of
funds was estimated to be 6.5Z. A preliminary estimate of spread to cover
costs and risk indicated 1.75Z. The mission recommended a uniform on-lending
rate of 9Z for all subloans in the Project, which would be closer to the rate
of inflation in Yugoslavia at that time (and estimated to be 12S p.a. for
1976-1980).
2.07-    At the time of the decision meeting a study on interest rates in
Yugoslavia was being carried out under the First Agriculture Credit Loan, to
be followed by the Bank's study of investment decision-making at the
enterprise level. It was felt that there was not enough evidence that
Yugoslavia had accepted a policy change from multiple to uniform interest
rates and it was, therefore, decided that the appraisal report should be
prepared on the basis of existing rate systems in Yugoslavia. However, a
dissenting opinion was recorded in the De ision Memorandum of July 16, 1976
included the suggestion that a decision await the outcome of the study whose
basic purpose would have been undermined by a decision in favor of multiple
interest rates, and requested further management guidance. This issue was
resolved by the Loan Committee (para 2.09).
2.08     A revamping of the FY77 Lending Program made it possible to allocate
additional Bank financing from a proposed US$15 million to US$18-19 million.
It was decided to increase the size of, and the Bank's contribution to, the
individual sector portion, and Bank funds would therefore cover the full
foreign exchange costs of the project. It was later agreed, in November 1976,
on the basis of a change in the Bank's lending policy, to include financing
the interest during construction, and thus the Bank loan increased in size to
US$24 million.
D. Negotiations
2.09     The Loan Committee met on August 3, 1976 to consider the interest
rate issue. It decided to consider the findings of the interest rate study to
be available by about October 1976 and in the context of the Loan Committee



-5-
submission of the proposed loan. Later, when a review of the preliminary
draft of the Yugoslav study revealed that the study would not add much to the
Bank's knowledge, the Loan Committee, without meeting, decided that on-lending
terms for Bank funds be 12% p.a. which would approximate market costs of
foreign borrowings. to Yugoslav investors and also provide an adequate spread
for SBS. On the portion financed from local loans, the Bank had no objection
to the multiple interest rate system in this project.
2.10     Negotiations took place in Washington, D.C. from December 13 to 18,
1976. Only two changes emerged from negotiations. One was agreement on an
on-1r::ing rate of 11% for Bank funds, instead of 12Z proposed by the Loan
CoamiGttee; and the Macedonia delegation agreed to maintain an adequate spread
on their local funds to cover all administrative and other expenses related to
subloans as stipulated in the Supplemental Letter No. 8. The second was that
the US$100,000 originally proposed to finance retroactively the extension of
an irrigation study begun under the First Macedonia Agricultural Industries
Project would be used for a feasibility study for the design, construction and
operation of a wholesale market center for agricultural products, with no
provision for retroactive financing.
2.11     It was also agreed that SBS would not carry any foreign exchange risk
(Loan Agreement para 5.07) but that the social sector subborrowers would bear
the full foreign exchange risk for their own investments and SRM wuuld bear it
for the subloans to the individual sector (Supplemental Letter No. 4).
E. Board Presentation and Effectiveness
2.12     The Executive Directors approved a loan of US$24 million on
February 22, 1977. The theme of the loan presentation was the importance of
Agriculture in the development of Macedonia. The loan was signed on harch 10,
1977. The original loan effectiveness date was June 30, 1977 and it became
effective on July 27, 1977, after the Bank had received evidence of the Loan
and Guarantee Agreements' ratification by the Yugoslavia's Federal Assembly.
F. Prciect Obiectives and Description
2.13     The project -;s to provide credit to support Macedonia's long-term
objectives of selL-_-.fficiency in and increased exports of agricultural
production. It was to make funds available through SBS for credits to six
social sector enterprises and some 910 individual sector farmers for
investments in agricultural processing facilities and primary production.
Processing investments were to include cold storage, vegetable and fruit
processing, tobacco drying, dairying and slaughtering facilities; in primary
production the project was to finance the establishment of vineyard and fruit
plantations, as well as investments in li-estock, plastic greenhouses for
vegetable production, and on-farm mechanization. The project also aimed at
strengthening the organization and appraisal and supervision capacity of SBS.

/1   In a situation of processing units with strong seasonal elements, it is
not possible to have a durable and constant definition of capacity.
Thus, during the course of project implementation, as seasonal
availability and variety of products increased, stated capacities if sce&e
of these plants changed. This is reflected in the discussion below.



-7-
2.15     Social Sector  A new milk processing plant of a capacity of 40,000
liters/day was to be built in Prilep in replacement of an existing obsolete
plant of 10,000 liters/day. The new slaughtering plant for 300,000 lamb and
sheep and 12,000 cattle per year was to be built in Gostivar to replace an
existing obsolete abattoir, representing an increase in capacity of abQut 30%,
and was to include facilities for processing edible and inedible by-products.
The new 5,000 ton potato cold store was to be built in Delcevo, with basic
facilities for washing, grading, sizing and bagging the potatoes. In
Gevgelija, the fruit and vegetable processing plant was to be expanded from
about 12,000 tons per year to 20,000 m tons. This involved construction of a
new building with a new line for processing tomatoes and increasing the
capacity of the existing lines for processing fruits. A new plant was to be
built in Sveti Nikole to produce tomato paste and dehydrated vegetables such
as onions, peppers, carrots. leeks and parsley. The capacity of the plant was
to be about 50,000 tons of vegetables annually, of which 30,000 tons were to
be co'mctoes- A new processing plant for apples of an annual capacity of
10,000 tons was to be built near Resen, to process reject grade apples into
products such as apple juice concentrate, pure nectar, concentrated aroma and
distilled alcohol.
2.16     Associated Individual Sector-l/  Subloans were to be provided to
about 220 farmers for on-farm development of about 1 ha each o' orchards and
vineyards, for peaches, apples, apricots and sour cherries. Investments
included land preparation, planting materials, fertilizer and labor. About 20
farmers were to receive subloans for the construction of plastic greenhouses
to develop labor intensive, early vegetable production, mainly tomatoes,
peppers and cucumbers. Investments included tubing, plastic for covering and
other construction items. About 120 subloans were to be made to farmers to
finance tractors and implements such as trailors, ploughs, tillers, rollers,
and harrows. Farmers were expected to cultivate, apart from their own land,
neigizburing farms against service charges. The project was also to provide
about 50 subloans for the purchase of a total of 300 in-calf heifers and dairy
cows, and 500 subloans for purchase of a total of 20,000 ewes. The
subborrowers wer'.e to purchase the animals from social sector enterprises.
Investments were also to include construction of winter housing, feeding
facilities and pasture improvement to increase fodder production. Credit was
to be provided for the construction of four tobacco drying sheds of 200 ton
drying capacity each of Virginia tobacco.
2.17     Market Center Feasibility Study.  The marketing study undertaken
under the First Agricultural Industries Project--Macedonia (Loan 894-YU)
recommended the establishment of a wholesale market center for agricultural
products. The Government of Macedonia accepted the proposal and intended to
build a marketing center in or near Skopje, to collect from various parts of
Macedonia mostly fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy products, process the
produce and market it in Yugoslavia and abroad. Under this project US$100,000
were provided to finance the foreign exchange cost of the feasibility study
for the construction and operation of the market center.
1/ All individual sector farmers participating in this project were
associated farmers. For definitions, see para 1.02, footnote 1.



-8-
2.18     Total project costs were estimated at Din 1,088 million (US$56
million) of which Din 378.4 million (US$21 million) would have been the
foreign exchange component. The Bank loan of US$24 million equivalent to SBS
was for a term of 15 years including a three year grace period, at an annual
interest rate of 8.5% and was to finance the total foreign exchange costs of
the project and interest during construction on the Bank loan. Cooperatives
and social sector enterprises were to carry out project investments under
agricultural credit subprojects administered by SBS.
III. Implementation
A. Start-up
3.01     Within the first year of implementation, from July 27, 1977 through
June 1978 SBS had approved four subloans for the social sector investments
with a total cost of US$ 24.9 million and six subloans for the individual
sector with a total cost of US$ 1.4 million. Thus almost half of the total
investment of US$ 56 million had been committed. The two remaining
agroindustry investments were expected to be approved by August 1978.
3.02     At the same time, progress on staffing SBS was a bit slower.
According to the Loan Agreement (Section 3.02), SBS was required to establish
by September 1, 1977 a Project Coordination Unit, and to hire an agricultural
marketing specialist, an agroindustries specialist, and a procurement
specialist.  The Project Coordination Unit had already been established by May
23, 1977. An agroindustries specialist was appointed on September 1, 1977,
resigned in April 1978, and was eventually replaced in January 1979. For the
marketing specialist, the Bank agreed in January 1979 that the Assistant
Director of SBS' Agriculture and Forestry Department would satisfy the
requirements. By September 1978 SBS had hired a firm as procurement
consultants and a procurement seminar had been conducted (stipulated in the
Loan Agreement, Section 3.07, to have been done March 1, 1978).
3.03     For the preparation of a feasibility study on a marketing center to
be established in Skopje, SBS had contracted consultants July 1977. Following
a May 1977 Bank supervision mission SBS accepted the Bank's recommendation
that the consultants be assisted by a specialized consultant firm experienced
in the design and operatior, of wholesale market centers. A contract was
signed in 1979 with such a specialized firm.
3.04     According to the Loan Agreement, para 3.05, SBS was responsible for
putting into effect by March 1, 1978 both a supervision system for technical
and financial aspects of the subprojects and a monitoring system to evaluate
the benefits and assessing the economic impact of the subprojects. In a
supervision report of May l979 it was reported that these requirements were
complied with one year late, by March 1979. It is not clear, however, that an
effective evaluation system ever actually produced results (paras 7.01-7.02).
B. Revisions
3.05     Macedonia's tobacco production of about 28,000 tons in 1974 was
roughly half of Yugoslavia's total production. Virginia tobacco is mainly



-9-
grown in irrigated areas and exclusively on individual farms. The First
Agroindustry Project Macedonia, Loan 894-YU, had already financed tobacco
driers for Virginia tobacco. In that project, however, driers of ten tons
were proposed for the individual sector. By 1974 the proposals were changed
for economic reasons to 50-100 ton driers for the social sector, of which five
were constructed. At the time of appraisal in 1976, the mission proposed four
drying sheds of 200 tons drying capacity each, for the individual sector. In
fact dryers of this size would have to be constructed and run by collectives
of farmers and thus be part of the social sector.
3.06     By May 1979, one of the four dryers had been constructed but no
further interest was shown.1' On the basis of technical and economic
grounds, SBS requested and the Bank agreed to finance instead small 3-ton
units for individual farmers. About 560 subloans were approved for the
construction of small tobacco driers, which ultimately benefited about 1,000
tobacco growers.
3.07     The potato cold store was to be built with a 5,000-ton capacity.  In
August 1978, however, SBS requested a storage capacity for fruits and
vegetables instead of potatoes because a potato processing plant that was to
be built had been cancelled and demand for potato storage was limited.
Meanwhile, the Investor had begun fruit orchards whose output would require
storage. After considerable correspondence the Bank agreed to the
modifications in February 1979. After the cold store had been contracted,
however, the Investor requested a reduced storage capacity of 3,500 tons.
Since the cold store was constructed in 1981 it has been used primarily for
apples, of which 60Z comes from within the same basic organization.
3.08     Dry Vegetable Plant.  The appraisal planned for a dry vegetable plant
to process about 50,000 tons of raw material, a' readily available in the
region of Sveti-Nikole, for processing into tomato paste and dehydrated
vegetables (onions, leeks, peppers, etc.). The plant that was built has a
capacity of 17,000 tons of throughput, all in dehydrated vegetables. The
tomato line, representing 25,000-30,000 tons, or 60Z, of the throughput, was
not constructed, but otherwise the plant followed the appraisal design. The
rationale for this change was that the market for tomato products had changed
and that another plant under the project was to produce tomato products. This
was accepted by the Bank.
3.09     Associated Individual Sector.  Under this project SBS onlent funds to
kombinats and cooperatives, which in turn made subloans to individual farmers
associated with them. After two years of project implementation, in June
1979, SBS requested and the Bank agreed to a reallocation of the Bank's loan
that gave more emphasis to on-farm mechanization. SBS justified this request
with a shift in demand and its obligation for timely project implementation.
I/ It is interesting to note that the PCR for Loan 894-YU estimated a 1X rate
of return to the larger driers. This PCR estimates a 15Z rate of return
to the smaller driers.
2/ The appraisal report described a 50,000 ton plant, but tables on its
operations showed only 40,000 tons throughput.

3.10     The closing date was postponed once from June 30, 1982 to June 30,
1983 because of implementation delays (paras 3.12 - 3.17).
C. Physical Implementation
3.11     PbyRical implementatinn of the project is shown in Chart I, in which
actual performance is compared to appraisal schedule for each major
component. Design changes, cost overruns and procurement problems in the
social sector delayed implementation. Details by project component are
described in the following paragraphR.
(i) Social Sector
3.12     The Dairy Plant at Prilep was initially delayed because the Bank
questioned the inclusion of equipment to process aseptic milk because of its
high investment cost. SBS and the investor reappraised the subproject,
excluding the aseptic milk line. Then the turnkey contract became effective
one year late because the foreign subcontractor had problems obtaining an
import license for equipment. Although due to be completed in 1980, it was
only by mid-1983 that the dairy plant construction was near completion. By
June 1985, however, it was still not operating because it did not have a
source of power. The plant had originally planned to take its energy from the
nearby malt plant, but it was subsequently discovered that the malt plant and
its generator would be closed every year for maintenance. The dairy was
therefore installing its own boiler. Because the technical analysis of energy
sources was not properly worked out, the dairy plant has lost several years of
operation.
3.13     For the slaughterhouse at Gostivar the lowest evaluated bid showed a
considerable cost increase (39% above Bank appraisal and 23% above SBS
appraisal). Negotiation of some performance requirements also delayed
implementation and during this next delay costs increased further to about 60Z
higher than appraisal estimates. Construction finally started in November
1979 and was completed in August 1982, compared to an appraisal date of 1980,
with an overall cost overrun of 40L. Test runs began in October 1982 and the
guarantee was fulfilled by early 1983.



-11-
3.14     The potato cold store at Delcevo was delayed because of the change in
concept (para 3.08) and was completed in September 1981.
3.15     For the fruit and vegetable processing plant at Gevgelija, a
reconstruction of an existing vegetable processing plant, the original tender
documents had to be revised to add a price adjustment provision and several
months were added to the ususl bid time to give biddeis enough time to study
the existing plant. Once bids were received and evaluated, however, the Bank
agreed to the rejection of all the bids because (i) all oids substantially
exceeded the engineers' estimate, (ii) none of the bids were responsive and
(iii) market prospects for tomato products had changed since appraisal in
1976. With the help of the consulting firm the technical specifications were
re-written, and a new processing line was included in the existing building to
reduce the amount of civil works required. Re-bidding took place in December
1980 and the contract was signed in June 1981. Civil works completion was
delayed for the rehabilitation and expansion of the fruit and vegetable plant
while the grape concentration plant was completed in late 1982. After some
technical modifications the fruit and vegetable plant was put into operation
in late 1983.
3.16     The dehydrated vegetable plant at Sveti-Nikole  In the draft contract
for construction the Bank discovered inconsistencies with the original tender
documents. The proposed contract did not include the tomato processing line
which represented about 60P of the total production capacity (para 3.08). The
Bank also objected to the Investor's intention to sign two separate contracts,
one for civil works and one for equipment because the Bank believed that a
turnkey contract for this imported technology would be more efficient.X/
The bidding was repeated on modified tender documents in early 1981. The
contract was signed in June 1981 with a bidder different from the winner of
the first tendering. This led to an arbitration case between the investor and
the winner of the first tender at the Paris Chamber of Commerce. '
Construction was completed in time for testing in fall 1983.
3.17     For the apple processing plant at Resen bids were received in
November 1978 and their evaluation took more than six months. Another delay
of several months occurred in the summer of 1981 due to some minor parts
missing on the boilers. Tests were run in March 1982 and in summer 1982 the
Plant became operational.
I/ The Loan Agreement, Schedule 4 (para 2), specified that contracts for all
social sector investments, except the tobacco dryers, would be awarded
under turnkey contracts.
2/ The arbitration took place after the Loan closed and the files contain no
record of the result.

(ii)  Individual Sector
3.18     No major problems were experienced in the implementation of the
individual sector subloans. In '1977 and 1978 SBS had approved 207 credits to
subborrowers for the plantation of orchards and vineyards and the erection of
plastic greenhouses for off-season vegetable production, altogether about 128
ha (see Table 2 below). About 155 subloans had been approved for livestock
development, most of them between 1977 and 1979, financing the purchase of 150
heifers and cows and about 12,000 sheep. With these as well as with the
subloans for fruits and vegetable production, SBS reported the demand for
on-farm development to be satisfied. About 880 subloans were made for the
purchase of tractors and accessories between 1977 and 1982. The 556 tobacco
dryers were approved in 1979 constructed between 1980 and 1982. See Table 3
for full summary of appraisal vs. actual use of individual credit. Further
comment on the credit delivery system is in para 7.04.

Market Study
3.19     This Loan provided funds to do a detailed feasibility study for a
market center. The study was carried out in 1979 at an eventual cost of about
US$460,000 instead of the US$100,000 estimated at appraisal, and it
recommended location of a wholesale market center in Skopje. SRM did not
include investment for such a center in its Development Plan for the Republic
(1981-85) because of the expense, estimated in 1979 at about $68 million, and
therefore there has been no follow-up of the study. In the context of this
project, the lack of marketing facilities does not appear to be a constraint
on the marketing of primary products.

D. Quality of Proiect Works
3.20     The quality of project works appears satisfactory.  The civil works
are of generally good quality and above average design, with the exception of
some uneven work noted in the Dairy Plant. The processing equipment is
sophisticated and very high quality.
E. Ptocurement
3.21     The procurement procedures stipulated in the Loan Agreement comprised
ICB with turnkey contracts for processing facilities for the social sector and
advertising in accordance with local procedures (LCB) for contracts of
US$50,000 or more or negotiated purchase in accordance with LCB for contracts
less than US$50,000 for goods and works to be procured for individual sector
subborrowers. About one year after effectiveness procurement consultants were
employed and a procurement seminar held.
3.22     In spite of these arrangements, the procurement for the Social Sector
investments took an unduly long time. The Borrower complained about the
considerable time it took to procure agroindustrial processing plants through
ICB, but admits that Investors' modifications of designs and prolonged
selection of lowest evaluated bidders contributed to the delays. These
procurement delays were largely responsible for commissioning plants only at
the end of the project implementation period.
3.23     Turnkey contracts were required by the Loan Agreemenk (para 3.16.
FN 1/). The Bank felt that for installing equipment of the latest technology,
a turnkey contract would ensure that design and construction of the civil
works would be properly coordinated with the requirements of the equipment.
The Bank recognized, however, that in cases where local contractors had
sufficient experience and expertise a two-contract system was acceptable, '
and was prepared to make an exception to the turnkey contract requirement.
This sometimes meant, however, as is the case of Sveti-Nikole dry vegetable
plant (para 3.16), further delay in awarding contracts as the Bank and the
Borrower discussed the issue after the bid evaluation had already taken
place. The delays could have been avoided by agreeing before tendering that a
two contract system would be acceptable provided the civil works contractors
were prequalified. For the future agroindustrial subprojects, turnkey
contracts should still be specified, with exceptions made on a case by case
basis.
F. Project Cost
3.24     The total project cost was 100% higher in dinar terms than estimated
at appraisal, but lower in dollar terms by about 11% (see Table 4 below). The
reasons for the dinar cost overrun were that the components were carried out
two to four years later than anticipated and inflation during the entire
1/ This two-contract system had been used in several.subprojects in the first
project (Loan 894-YU) with good results and the PCR recognized that on e
case by case basis the two contract system was acceptable.



-15-
project period was higher than projected at appraisal.l/ At the same
time,however, the dinar was devalued by about 400% between 1977 and 1983
(Table 4, FN 2). The largest cost overruns were in the Gostivar
slaughterhouse, at 276S, and the vegetable processing extension at Gevgelia,
at 236X. Both of these investments were due to be made in 1978-79 and were,
in fact, carried out mainly in 1982 and 1983 1' (paras 3.12-3.17).
3.25     In the individual sector, the deviation of actual costs of credit
from appraisal estimate was due mainly to the different uses of credit.  For
example, for tractors, subloans were made for about 870 tractor sets because
farmers showed a particular interest in them, while the appraisal expected
only about 120 subloans for this purpose. The cost of the tractors was in
fact somewhat lower in dinar terms than projected, but this may be because the
additional equipment purchased with the tractors was less than foreseen at
appraisal. For credit to individual farmers for fruits and vegetables, on the
other hand, only about 130 hectares were developed compared to 240 hectares
expected at appraisal.

Year I as starting July 1, 1977. Thus the figures are shown at
mid-year.
The period from 1981-83 represents 65% of actual expenditure, whereas
appraisal estimated that by mid-1981 the project would be essentia;';
completed, except for a performance guarantee period on the processing
equipment. Project costs by year by activity are in Annex 2.
G. Financing
3.27     The original financing plan, excluding interest during construction,
showed that the investors would contribute 20% of the project costs and SBS
43X. This arrangement was also stated as part of the Operations and Policies
for the Project in the Loan Agreement (Schedule 5, para 3(A) Terms of
Subloans). In the event, however, the subborrower's contribution (excluding
the capitalized interest during construct,ton) was about 17 and SBS' was 39X,
with the remainder coming from IBRD (40S) and other foreign sources (see
Table 5 below).

exchange rate for the entire project period is US$1.0   41 dinars; since disbursement from IBRO typically lagged expenditure
by 3-6 months, the average exchange rate for disbursement of IBRD funds was US$1.0 = 49 dinars.

3.28     The Loan Agreement stipulated a minimum of 20% contribution to
project costs from subborrowers, the maintenance of not less than 75% to 25%
debt/equity ratio by social sector subborrowers and sufficient cash flow to
meet all their financial obligations. However, the social sector subborrowers
failed to meet their cont: ibution or to maintain the agreed debt/equity ratios
(see para 5.05 and Annex 3). The cost overruns experienced in all
agroindustry subprojects (see Table 4 above) were financed by resorting to
more borrowing from Federal and Republic Funds, local banks, from the World
Bank and other foreign sources. This lack of financial discipline at a time
of rapid inflation and devaluation of the dinar, has left all social sector
subborrowers in a precarious financial condition (see Annex 3).
3.29     For the borrowed funds from foreign sources (mainly IBRD, but 42 from
others), the social sector subborrowers assumed the foreign exchange risk, as
required in the Loan Agreement (para 2.11). At the time of appraisal and
negotiations (1976-77) the dinar had been stable since 1971, showing a total
devaluation of about 6S, and the risks appeared minimal. The lack of
financial discipline described above (para 3.28) compounded by a ten-fold
devaluation of the dinar has resulted in social sector subborrowers being
unable to meet their debt service obligations (see para 5.06). As a result
all social sector subborrowers have requested and received from SBS a
refinancing of their loan repayments which has also affected SBS' own ability
to repay the IBRD loan (paras 5.12-5.13). During the course of construction
of subprojects, the Borrower has failed to keep under constant review the
financing plans and cashflow requirements of social sector subuorrowers in
accordance with the Loan Agreement (Loan Agreement Schedule 5 paras 2(B)(c)
and (d)). This failure of the Borrower was not discussed in the imk's
supervision reports.
H. ComDliance with Loan Covenants
3.30     Aside from the important loan covenants mentioned above (para 3.28 &
3.29) that were not fulfilled, the other loan covenants were fulfilled,
although some of them with a delay of up to one year. Among them was the
recrui-meut of procurement consultants hired 11 months late.  Had they been
hired on time, procurement delays and cost overruns could perhaps have been
avoided to a certain extent. The position of the marketing consultant was
filled about 15 months later than stipulated. The monitoring system was
established one year later than stipulated but systematic evaluation of the
individual sector did not take place (paras 7.01-7.02).
I. Disbursements
3.31     Throughout the project, dis:.ursements lagged behind appraisal
estimates and, except for one quarter, were never more than 53% of the
original estimates. The Loan closing date was extended from June 30, 1982 to
June 30, 1983. Final disbursement was January 18, 1984 at which time there
were still US$2.34 million undisbursed. This amount was cancelled. The
estimated and actual disbursements schedule is at Annex 1.

IV. Agricultural Impact
A. Crop Yields and Incremental Production
4.01     The project's annual incremental primary production in the individual
sector is summarized in Table 6 and livestock and crop yields in Table 7. The
information is based on a combination of the Borrower's PCR and mission field
visits. Systematic farm surveys apparently were not done, so mission
assumptions included the following: incremental production of vegetables and
wheat came mainly from the mechanization component, which exceeded appraisal
estimates. It was assumed that each subloan for tractor and equipment was
used for production on 10 hectares (5 of the farmers' own and 5 of the other
farmers who rented out the tractor services), and the 10 hectares were planted
to wheat, barley, tomatoes and cabbage. Incremental production came from both
an expansion of the area that could be cultivated with tractors and from
higher yields from more intensive use of fertlizers and chemicals.L' For
the sheep farms, the meat yields are less than appraisal because the lambs are
sold quite young, at about 15 kg liveweight, rather than the 25-35 kg expected
at appraisal.

B.  Agronomic Practices and Inputs
4.02     Iatensified agricultural production is the project's major impact in
the individual sector with mechanization as the main cause. According to
mission field visits, use of tractors was accompanied by increased use of
fertilizers, irrigation and extension services. For livestock production,
intensive forage production replaced pastures. The extension service (see
para. 7.03) assisted in replacing grain production with more intensive crops
like fruit and vegetable. With early vegetable and/or late forage crops
preceding and/or following the main crop, multicropping systems were
introduced.
C. Food Processing
4.03     The first full year of production for most of the plants was 1984.
Thus, except for the slaughterhouse, none was operating yet at full
capacity-L- although all had plans to approach that level in 1985. The
plants were generally well designed, with good layout and equipment, and on
1/ Even assuming single shift operations during "peak season", these new
plants were not operating at full capacity.



-22-
the basis of 1984 performance they appear to have good potential to be
efficiently run from a technical point of view, except for the dry vegetable
plant (para 4.15). Financially, the firms are doing badly and revenues do not
in general cover the full costs of production (para 5.05). The managers were
generally dynamic and informed and were well aware of the operatiunal,
financial and marketing problems they faced.
4.04     Slaughterhouse at Gostivar.  The first full year of production was
1983 and by 1984 the slaughterhouse was operating at over 100% capacity by
doing part of a second shift. Instead of the 350,000 head total capacity, the
slaughterhouse had a throughput of 420,000 head of lamb and 8,000 head of
cattle. The plant is able to sell the full amount of fresh meat produced, of
which about 70% is exported to Italy and Greece and Arab countries in Northern
Africa and the Middle East. The plant is arranging raw material supply to
expand its operations up to 625,000 head. The managers felt coniLdent that
they had an adequjate market because they have been in the business for about
twenty-five years and have well established customers and markets,
particularly abroad.
4.05     The project also financed equipment for canning, vacuum packing and
sausages which has to date not been operated. The staff have had several
training sessions on the technology required for use of the new equipment, and
the management has asked the Institute of Meat Technology (Belgrade) to help
them in product testing. Since the plant does not now have an important
supply of low grade meat nor were-there indications that the margins would be
greater than for fresh meat, it was questionable whether the plant should be
devoting energy and resources to this new equipment. It further raised the
question of the rationale for including the equipment at appraisal in a
slaughterhouse whose primary activity was production of fresh meat, in which
the slaughterhouse was well experienced and from which they made an adequate
margin from exports as well as domestic sales (financial results para 5.05).
4.06     Tobacco Drier at Debar.  According to the Borrower's PCR and visits
with the farmers using the 200-ton tobacco drier, it is operating at full
capacity, with a throughput of 1,200 tons green Virginia tobacco to produce
200 tons dried tobacco, about 70% of which is exported (to Germany and
Austria) and the rest sold domestically. With the recent increases in
purchase price of green tobacco (reported to be about 100% in the last two
years, now up to 35-40 dinars/kg) and the selling price of processed tobacco
increasing by less, the margins on the drier's operations have been squeezed.
Data were insufficient to estimate the profitability of the drier.
4.07     Apple processing plant at Resen.  At appraisal, the market looked
promising in West Germany for processed apple and apple products and
sufficient raw materials were available in the region to supply a 10,000-ton
plant. The intention was Lo produce in bulk for the export market. The
larger 18,000-ton plant was commissiovsd in November 1983k' and 1984 was the
1/ The Bank had agreed to a proposal to expand apple processing capacity to
12,000 tons/year. A supervision mission discovered that during
construction, the Investor agreed with the contractor to make minor design
changes to allow processing of other fruits and some vegetables (cherries,
blackberries, pears, apricots, onions and garlic). This extended the
season and thus total intake capacity to the 18,000 tons now stated by
plant management.



-23-
first full year of production. Of the total capacity to process 18,000 tons
and produce 8,500 tons (average input:output ratio of about 2:1), the plant
processed 15,000 tons in 1984; most of the fruit was apples (13,500 tons).
The output was only 3,500 tons giving an input:output ratio of 4.3:1, because
the plant produced mainly concentrates.which have a higher input-output ratio
than other products such as juices, nectars, and purees.
4.08     The plant was run reasonably efficiently, with some improvements
possible in cleanliness and quality control. The plant needs to hire
consultants to determine its real technical capability, the actual
performance, and to develop proposals for improving the performance. In
addition, because the price of raw materials has increased more rapidly than
the output prices and poses financial problems for the plant (para 5.02 and
TabLe 8), the plant should organize its procurement of raw materials into
contract arrangements, buying fixed quantitiev at prices fair co both the
suppliers and the plant. The nanagement is well aware of the marketing and
profit margin problems the plant faces and is considering options to improve
ics financial situation.
4.09     Dairy Plant at Prilep.  At appraisal, it was estimated that
sufficient daily raw milk supplies were available in the Prilep valley to
serve a 40,000 liter/day plant, but that the main constraints to increased
milk production were a lack of organized milk collection and low yielding
cows. The plant management did not supply any data, however, on specific
plans for collecting the raw milk supply, or on likely availability, except
that they were planning to purchase about 500 in-calf heifers for sale to the
associated individual and social sectors to increase the milk supply.l/
4.10     In the absence of actual experience and data on supplies, the
expected capacity utilization is uncertain. For the financial results below
(para 5.07), the mission made estimates based on discussions with the plant
management.
4.11     The major problem already facing the old dairy plant is that because
the seiling price of fresh milk has been regulated it has not covered even the
variable costs of production. At the same time the purchase price of raw milk
has increased about 400% since 1981.  The selling price of processed fresh
milk has been deregulated at a Federal level since January 1, 1985 and unless
the Republic or commune changes the situation, the market will determine the
price. This should improve margins somewhat. In addition, the managers of
the sew dairy plan to produce yogurt, sour milk, cheese and butter, which have
higher margins. The old plant does not, however, produce these products, so
that although Prilep area shops have these products from elsewhere in
Yugoslavia the market ability to absorb 3,600 tons of yogurt and 2,000 tons of
sour milk, plus smaller amounts of cheese (550 tons) and butter (40 tons) is
uncertain. Financial results are ar^e discussed in para 5.05.
1/ This would add a total of 4,000-5,000 liters/day of milk.



-24-
4.12     Vegetable Processing Plant at Gevgelia.  The first full year of
operation was 1984 and it operated at about 65% capacity (of a total output
capacity of 10,200 tons,-/ the plant produced 6,600 tons).  The plan is to
increase output to 95% of capacity in 1985.
4.13     As expected at appraisal sufficient raw material supply is not a
problem, although the organized, timed procurement needs improvement. The
appraisal expected most of the product to be exported, mostly to Western
Europe, but in fact so far 80% of the sales have been on the domestic market
and the plan for 1985 is to continue this pattern. (Financial results are in
para. 5.05).
4.14     Cold Store at Delcevo.  By 1981 a 3,500-ton cold store for apple
storage had been built. In 1984, about 3,200 tons of apples were stored for
about six months and small amounts of tea (100 tons) and cheese (30 tons).
The manager plans to increase the capacity utilization by using the slow
freezing chambers to store other fruits. The cold store does not buy and sell
the apples but stores them on behalf of the producers, the most important one
being an orchard within the same basic organization. The revenue to the cold
store comes only from the storage charge of 0.8 dinars per kilo per month.
Because the total capacity of the store is actually 3,500 tons x 12 months, or
42,000 tons, it operated in 1984 at about 45% capacity. The cold store needs
to seek actively other products to increase its capacity utilization.
Financial results are in para. 5.05.
4.15     Dry Vegetable Plant at Sveti Nikole.  The first full year of
operation, 1984, had the plant operating at 25% capacity and the major problem
with production was that the ratio of input to output was on average 15:1
instead of the planned 10:1. Onions, which the plant has the largest capacity
to process (almost 40% of total capacity), had the best ratio, but in fact the
largest volume of production was the peppers, with the worst ratio (17:1).
The plant management should hire a short-term consultant to examine carefully
the processing lines, using a "mass balance" approach which tries to identify
the weight loss at each phase of processing to account for the sources of
loss. This important technical problem represents a serious financial problem
when translated into profit margins. Marketing and financial problems are
discussed below (paras. 4.25-4.27 and 5.05).
1/ The appraisal report stated that the old plant had an intake capacity of
12,000 tons. The subproject was to expand this to 20,000 tons. At the
time of tendering, however, in 1979, the tender documents stated that the
old plant had a capacity of 20,000 tons and that 10,000 tons processing
capacity would be added. This is in fact what has happened, so that the
vegetable plant is now capable of processing about 31,000 tons to produce
10,200 tons final product.



-25-
D. Raw Material Supply
4.16     Raw material supply for the processing plants was also projected to
be adequate. The main constraint to increasing agricultural production was
stated to be lack of processing facilities, and with an assumed demand for
production from the plants, fruit and vegetable output would increase. In
fact, as projected, the raw material supply has not proved to be a problem in
terms of quantities available for most of the plants, with two exceptions:
the cold store (para. 4.14) and the Prilep dairy (para. 4.09).
4.17     The supply of raw materials has not been a problem, although the
rapid increase in input prices, shown below in Table 8 have exceeded increases
in output prices. In addition, the appraisal analyzed raw material supply at
the cost of tonnage delivered, when some plants such as the apple and dairy
plants are required to procure their raw material by purchasing from
collectives, kombinats, or other points of collection, sometimes beyond a
50 km radius, thus incurring transport costs. In addition, variety, quality
and timing of supply have been problems. The dry vegetable plant, for
example, may need to procure specific varieties of vegetables to improve its
technical performance; the apple processing plant had problems in its first
full year of operation with uneven quality of apples and plans to work with
farmers on establishing standards; the vegetable processing plant at Gevgelia
purchased too many tomatoes at once and has to organize timed procurement
better.
E. Marketing and Markets
4.18     At the time of appraisal, most of the incremental primary production
and about 20Z of the processed products from the project was expected to be
marketed domestically. With projected increases in per capita income,
urbanization and tourism, market prospects appeared good for both fresh and
processed fruits and vegetables. Macedonia already supplied other parts of
Yugoslavia with fresh produce and in some cases with significant proportions
of a commodity (table grapes, for example), so markets were to some extent
established. In addition to the domestic sales, it was expected that the
slaughterhouse would provide more fresh lamb for exporting to the Arab
countries in the Middle East and North Africa and the processed apple and
tomato would be exported to Western and Eastern Europe. Early vegetables from
greenhouse production could also be exported.
4.19     For fresh produce, farmers can sell their output through several
channels: the green market, various agricultural collectives, kombinats or
other market agents acting as wholesalers. The wholesalers sell the produce
to agroindustries, to retail shops or to Magro, the marketing work
organization for the Republic's umbrella agricultural kombinat, United
Kombinat of Macedonia.
4.20     Although it is not the only marketing channel used by producers and
wholesalers, Ilagro is reswaoible for exports as wel' as sales to other
Republics. It charges a 2% commission for its services and maintains offices
and trading contacts in various countries. Magro also sells processed foods,
including the output i.-rom this project as well as wine oad other meats. In



-26-
spite of the trading network maintained by Magro, it does not appear to take
an aggressive approach to marketing and has not developed a clear strategy for
dealing in competitive markets. For the fresh meat from this project, this is
not a problem and the milk and milk products will be domestically marketed,
but the processed fruits and vegetables from the Resen, Gevgelia, and Sveti
Nikoli plants do require a special market effort. Magro should play a role in
seeking out potential customers, promoting these products, and providing
market information to the plants on quality, packaging and other product
information that would help the plants export at better market prices.
Because a strong export demand for these products was assumed at appraisal,
the need to develop an aggressive market strategy was not discussed. With an
expanding EEC and increased competition from non-EEC member countries,
however, this is no longer the case. A coordinated export strategy is
required for Yugoslavia's agroindustrial products, at the Republic level and
at the Federal level.
Tndividual Sector
4.21     Incremental production attributable to the project from the
individual sector would include fresh vegetables from plastic greenhouses,
fresh fruits such as table and wine grapes and peaches from investments in
orchards, milk, milk products, wool and lambs from mini sheep and dairy farms,
and cereals such as wh.eat, corn, or soya from investment in mechanization.
4.22     For fresh produce, Macedonia still enjoys a healthy demand, both
domestically and abroad. In 1984, Macedonia exported to Western Europe about
US$3 million worth of fresh fruits and vegetables (about 4,500 tons), which
represented less than 2. of marketed production in Macedonia. In addition,
other Republics rely on Macedonia for supply of certain fruits and vegetables,
such as paprikas (red peppers) and for early and later season produce. With
the recent completion of the agroindustrial plants under this project as well
as those being constructed under Macedonia III (Loan 2039-YUTJ) and already
constructed under a previous project (Loan 894-YU financed a wine cellar and
wine by-products plant), the demand for Macedonia's fresh produce, of all
grades, is not likely to suffer in the near future. For other individual
sector output, such as the cereals, Yugoslavia is in deficit (wheat, soya
beans, maize), so the market for any surplus is quite strong. Yugoslavia also
has a deficit in milk and milk products so farmers' output, in excess of home
consumption, should have a ready market. In spite of this, subsidies are
required on the farmgate price (para. 4.09), although marketing processed milk
should not be a problem. For the market for livestock, the recent
construction or expansion of slaughterhouse facilities for lamb in Gostivar
under this project and for pigs and cattle in Sveti Nikole under Loan 894-YU
ensures an adequate demand for the animals.

4.23     Domestic Market.  With recent expansion throughout Yugoslavia of
fruit and vegetable processing facilities and slaughterhouses and a

capacity to produce frozen fruits and vegetables.



-27-
simultaneous slowing down of the economy and real income levels, domestic
marketing of manufactured fruits and vegetables and processed meats has become
problematic. Supplies of bottled and canned juices have increased, while
demand has slowed down. Both the apple processing plant at Resen and
Gevgelia's vegetable processing plant have difficulty marketing their bottled
products domestically. Given the projections on the domestic economy, which
include high inflation and low real growth for the next three to five years,
neither plant should count on domestic sales of packaged products. The fruit
and vegetable plants should explore possibilities of supplying their processed
products in bulk to other domestic suppliers, which would eliminate the costly
packaging activities.
4.24     The fresh lamb from the slaughterhouse, on the other hand, has a
ready domestic market. For processed meat and for milk and milk products,
which neither plant has started producing yet, the market is unknown. The
processed meat from Gostivar would likely be competing for the same market as
the processed meat from the Sveti Nikole plant (financed under Loan 894-YU)
and with stagnating or decreasing per capita incomes, demand may not be very
strong in general for processed meats. For fresh milk, Macedonia is in
deficit, so the Prilep dairy would help satisfy this demand, but other milk
products, such as cheese, butter and sour milk, are common items made and
consumed at home and thus the market may be limited for these higher-priced
items. Also the self sufficiency of Macedonia in milk will reduce the
purchases now coming from Serbia and may affect the latter's dairy industry.
The problem of supply and marketing in agroindustry must, in future, be
reviewed in a broader regional and national context.
4.25     Export Market.  The export demand for some of these processed
products is strong such as for dried vegetables and processed apple products.
Except for the slaughterhouse at Gostivar, these plants are recent entrants to
the export markets. Under the project, a program of visits and "training" was
organized for the managers of several plants (Resen apple plant, Gevgelia
vegetable plant, Delcevo cold store, and several other enterprises financed
under other Bank projects) to the United States to acquaint them with similar
operations and marketing strategies elsewhere that were relevant to their
businesses. Whether as a result of this trailning or whether the managers were
in any case outward-looking, they seemed particularly aware of market strategy
and competitive demands for quantity, quality, packaging and timing.  In this
respect, they seemed more aggressive than the official marketing channel for
exports, Magro. In addition, at least one purchase contract for a plant's
product resulted from contacts made during the training.
4.26     Competition in West European markets is quite strong, particularly
from other East European countries.  These plants need to develop a market
strategy, to develop customers who rely on them to provide a timely, high
quality product and to promote their products among several customers, both
foreign and domestic, so as to be able to charge higher prices. As in the
case with domestic sales (para. 4.23), bulk sales should be attractive to the
plants, so plants should explore this export strategy to maximize profits.
4.27     The problem f_-r a11 the exporters in the project was that the export
prices received were lower than the domestic price, even after the premium
from Government for exporting (see Table 8 below). The plants felt compelled
to export, first of all because the demand was there in much larger quantities



-28-
than in the domestic market. Second, the exports earned badly need foreign
exchange to repay the foreign debts. As the dinar continues to devalue and
domestic output prices for processed goods lag behind inflation, the
difference between export and domestic prices may decrease in the next few
years.
V. Financial Results and Re-evaluation
A. Social Sector: Agjrcindustries
5.01     The profitability of the agroindustries in the project are seriously
threatened by sharply increased input prices (paras 5.02-5.03), technical
problems and increased processing and packaging costs in production (para
5.04), the high and increasing cost of loans (para 5.05), and marketing
problems which include limited domestic demand and low export prices (paras
4.23 and 4.27). These problems in turn affect SBS' financial situation (para
5.12).
Input Prices
5.02     Table 8 shows that since the time of appraisal up to 1984 or 1985
input prices have ilLcreased between thirteen and twenty fold, while the
overall increase in the price level up to 1985, measured by the consumer price
increase, has been about ninefold. The farmgate price for milk was
3.5 dinars/liter and in 1985 is estimated at 46 dinars/liter (depending on the
fat content). Lambs were bought in 1976 for 20-26 dinars/kg liveweight and in
1984 cost the slaughterhouse 350-450 dinars/kg. Fruits and vegetables have
increased most dramatically from less than 2 dinars/kg to 30-40 dinars/kg.
5.03    Most output prices have increased by proportionally less compared to
their input prices. The clearest example is for the vegetables. Onion input
prices have gone up from 0.7 dinarslkg to 35 dinars/kg, where the selling
price of a kilogram of dried onions has changed from 28-32 to 330-600 dinars.
The plant managers reported that the squeeze between input and output prices
has been particularly noticeable in the last few years: while the prices of
raw material for the Resen apple plant increased by 180X between 1981 and
1983, the prices of natural fruit juices increased by only 24X. This
situation may well be due to the large growth in capacity of fruit and
vegetable processors, placing upward pressure from increased demand for fresh
produce and downward pressure on prices of finished products from increased
supply into a stagnant market demand.
5.04     The problem of irput/ouput price squeezes has been compounded by the
increased costs of collecting and processing, particularly the increases in
the cost of energy, reported to have increased 240% between 1981 and 1983, and
the cost of packaging (bottles and other packing material), up by 260Z during
the same period.-' Thus, apart from the heavy burden of their financial
debts, the plants are operating in a much worse financial environment than
foreseen at appraisal.
1/ Compared to a cost of living increase of 187Z during the same period.

Financial Results
5.05     Financial structure of agroindustries.  The subloans are provided to
a Kombinat, Work Organization or a Basic Organization to undertake the
subprojects. The subborrower could be. an existing organization with other
activities or a new organization created to undertake the subproject. The
Balance Sheets and Income Statements for 1983 and 1984 fL. the subborrowers
are given in Annex 3. As seen from the Balance Sheet, given in Annex 3,
page 1, all subborrowers are undercapitalized and have negative working
capital due to extensive resorting to short-term financing (Bank loans) or
inability to pay their obligations (Payables and Accruals). The equity is
negative in most cases due to subborrowers' failure to contribute stipulated
percentage towards investment costs (see para 3.28 above) and due to foreign
exchange losses incurred on foreign borrowing. The Borrower has not reviewed
the financial condition and cashflow of the subborrowers as required in the
Loan Agreement. Such a review should be immediately undertaken with the
subborrowers and the kombinats of which they are members,'/ with a view to
restoring a sustainable debt/equity ratio and ensuring an adequate cashflow.
5.06     Debt servicing and loan repayment.  Because of the financial
structure described above, servicing of both domestic and foreign debt has
become the most difficult financial problem faced by all the subborrowers.
The situation is further compounded by the rapid devaluation in the dinar
which makes the repayment of World Bank and other foreign loans an ever
increasing financial burden. As can be seen from the 1983 and 1984 Income
Statements given in Annex 3, page 2, all subborrowers except one have failed
to generate a positive cashflow.2/ Therefore, subborrowers have been unable
to meet repayments (principal) and all World Bank subloan repayments have been
refinanced by SBS.  The terms for refinancing are ten years repayment at 247
per annum rate of interest.  The impact on SBS is discussed in paras 5.12-5.13.
5.07     Financial rates of return.  On the basis of the 1984 performance and
1985 plans provided by the plants, estimates were made of financial rates of
return in constant 1985 prices.  The revenues and costs used were those given
by the plants, except for the dairy plant where capacity utilization rates
assumed by the plant appeared high. The mission assumed the plant would start
operating only in 1986 at 50Z capacity and increase gradually to 85X capacity
by 1988. The mix of products for the dairy was as given by t'!ie plant, however.
5.08     The results are in Table 9 below.  Or. the cold store, the negative
rate of return is a reflection of the limited income earned by the cold store
from its storage fee. While it is true that capacity utilization is low, it
must be noted that the storage fee is a transfer price assigned to one unit in
a larger enterprise. This fee of dinar 0.8 per kg per month compares to the
1/ Work organizations and Basic organizations are members of a Kombinat who
pool their financial and other resources for common objectives of the
Kombinat.
2/ Interest payments shown in these statements are low compared with the
total debt. It is a common practice in Yugoslavia to show in Income
Statements only the paid interest. The unpaid interest, although due, is
simply left out of the accounts.



-31-
increase in the price of apples of 12-14 dinars per kg over six months which
is realized by the Basic Organization due to storage. Thus the financial
return to storage for the Basic Organization is much higher and the economic
rate of return, which considers the benefits of storage of all the apples,
including these from the associated individual sector, is about 10%.
5.09     Sensitivity analysis shows that the results are highly sensitive to
the assumptions. The revenues of the dairy plant reflect the assumption of
the dairy that half of their output will be sold as higher margin products of
yogurt and sour milk. If the plant sells only liquid milk a sensitivity
analysis shows that the rate of return becomes -9.8Z. Also for the dry
vegetable plant, the gross revenues depend on what proportion of output is
exported at lower prices (how much lower depends of course on the relative
rates of inflation and devaluation). If average prices are 5% lower than
projected here, the rate of return on the dry vegetable plant drops to 3.82.
The financial rates of returns calculated for all plants are based on actual
operations in only one year, 1984, which was also the first year of operation,
and on projections based on plans for 1985. At a time of high inflation and
devaluation, when margins change every year, the validity of rates calculated
on such projections are highly questionable. The Bank may want to reassess
results several years from now, after the plants have been in operation for a
longer period of time.

B. Individual Sector
5.10     Financial rates of return were calculated in constant 1985 prices tor
those categories of subloans where information was available or assumptions
could reasonably be made. The results are in Table 9 above. From these rates
of return, it can be seen why mechanization subloans were so popular: they
have one of the highest rates of return.



-33-
5.11     The highest rate of return is on plastic houses.  One of the main
limiting factorson demand for these subloans, however, is the availability of
family labor. While seasonal hired labor is commonly used in fruit orchards
at harvest time, the intensity of production in plastic houses precludes using
seasonal labor as easily. Thus, while the number of farmers taking subloans
for plastic houses was almost triple appraisal estimates (59 vs. 20
subborrowers), the area planted per farmer and total area under plastic houses
as well as total amounts borrowed were much smaller than expected at
appraisal. These rates of return must also be noted with caution, however.
Systematic farm surveys were apparently not carried out and thus yields,
returns and operating costs were assumed on the basis of the Borrower's PCR,
mission field visits and mission estimates. The rates of return are not as
sensitive as in the case of the social sector however: a decrease in benefits
of 5X in this sector affects the rates of return by two to five percentage
points, rather than the five to seven percentage points in the social sector.
One final point: it is clear from the rates of return varying from 13.21 up
as high as 46% in constant terms, that individual sector farmers could bear
interest rates well above the 11.5S charged to them under this loan.
C. SBS
5.12     The impact of the project on SBS' cash flow has not been good.
First, the Bank loan amortization schedule in the Loan Agreement (Schedule 3)
showed an annual repayment of US$2.0 million every year beginning July 1,
1980. SBS however granted its social sector subborrowers five to six years'
grace on their subloans, so that they were due to start repaying the loan only
in 1985. The original subproject submissions to the Bank show the three
years' grace as stipulated in the Loan Agreement, Schedule 5. It is not clear
whether this change in the grace period was ever explicitly discussed with
Bank missions, but this situation obviously created financial pressure for
SBS. In addition, now that the subloans are due and the investors are unable
to cover the costs of their repayments (para 5.05, 5.06 and Annex 3), SBS has
agreed to refinance their loans, util 1986.
5.13     SBS Balance Sheets and Income Statements are given in Annex 4 pages 1
and 2 respectively. At the end of 1983, about 60% of the long-term portfolio
was affected by arrears of which the largest share (801) is invested in the
social sector. In addition, the arrears ratio at the end of 1983 was 90X,1/
which means that in 1983 only 101 of maturity dues were collected. As no data
were provided on loan rescheduling, the situation could be even worse than
indicated by this ratio. At the time of the mission, arrears and collection
data were not available for 1984 and SBS has not made any projections for
1985. At the end of 1983, SBS had foreign sources of financing (short and
long term deposits and borrowing) amounting to Dinar 115 billion (US$ 900 2/
million) or 352 of total funding. The above described arrears situation has
resulted in SBS having to reschedule their 1983 and 1984 maturities of foreign
borrowings. By 1986, when (and if) the social sector subborrowers start
1/  The actual "rate of arrears' as measured by SBS shows the ratio of arrears
to total long term loan portfolio is 4.91. This does not express,
however, the full extent of the arrears problem.
2/ At the December 1983 exchange rate US$ 1 = Din 125.



-34-
repaying their subloans, SBS will already have a cumulative cashflow deficit
from payments of interest and principal to the World Bank of over US$13
million.l/ This figure does not include other obligations, the maturities of
which were not available.
5.14     This financial situat-on is not unique to SBS and it is clear that
the National Bank of Yugoslavia is involved in the World Bank's loan
repayments. For example, National Bank of Yugoslavia has agreed to assume the
foreign exchange risk of the Bank funds disbursed against local expenditures
(indirect foreign exchange). However, the long-term financial health of SBS
would depend on SBS' undertaking a detailed portfolio analysis and introducing
measures to improve debt collection.  SBS' current practices of portfolio
management are weak and attention is paid to subborrowers only when a request
for rescheduling is received or when a subborrower is already in qerious
arrears. Any future Bank participation in development work in Macedonia
should be subject to SBS agreeing to a thorough review of its portfolio,
introducing stricter portfolio management and developing reporting systems to
provide SBS management better control over collections and early warning on
possible defaults. Introduction of these measures may require agreement at
tl.. ILvel of National Association of Banks and the Federal Secretariat of
Finance.
VI. Economic Impact
6.01     Incremental Production.  The incremental production from th:.
individual sector most probably derives mainly from mechanization as the
largest single category of subloans. Assumptions were made on the impact on
wheat, barley and tomato producticon of about 20X increase in total output at
full development on abuit 8,700 ha(at 10 hectares per subloan for 873
subloans) over the without project situation. This amounts to an incremental
1,400 tons wheat, 700 tons barley, 7,300 tons tomatoes and 5,000 tons
cabbage.'' These amounts are in addition to the incremental production from
the other subloans for greenhouse production, dairy and sheep farms,
vineyards, orchards and tobacco driers shown in Table 6 above. With the
exception of the benefits from mechanization and tobacco driers, the actual
incremental production projected at full development falls short of
projections. This is because the area planted and number of animals are less
than projected, while yields of farms is assumed and estimated to be near or
exceeding appraisal estimates.
1/ At end 1983 total arrears on the long-term portfolio was about Din 9.2
billion or US$ 75 million equivalent. In addition, SBS had refinanced
about US$8.9 mill-on due them from social sector subborrow-rs under
this loan.
2/ This represents, for the Republic of Macedonia, about 1-2% of marketed
production of wheat and barley, and for tomatoes and cabbage would
mean a substantial increase (of about 12% and 401, respectively) in
marketed production if the full amount went into the market. As these
are simple assumptions on the cropping pattern to simplify
calculations, it is more likely that a greater variety of crops (to
include melons, onions, garlic, corn, alfalfa, etc.) is grown than
assumed here.



-35-
6.02     The second and larger source of incremental benefits is the
agroindustrial component of the project. The output of the social sector
processing units represents incremental value added and the net value added
has been calculated to arrive at a measure of the economic benefits of this
comprjner t.
6.03     Beneficiaries.  SBS records show that about 1,790 subloans were made
in the individual sector. This compares to 910 estimated at appraisal. In
addition, farm families able to hire the tractor services to plant larger
areas also benefited indirectly from the increased availability of tractors
for hire. rncreased employment opportunities for hired seasonal labor on
farms would also increase the number of beneficiaries but these numbers are
impossible to quantify. Finally, about 500 additional jobs have been or will
have been (after the dairy plant starts operating) created in the social
sector plants plus seasonal labor in the plants.
6.04     Foreign Exchange Effects.  The bulk of the foreign exchange earnings
in this project comes from the exports of processed foods from the social
sector, and in 1985 they will amount to about US$13 million equivalent.l/ At
appraisal it was estimated that over the 30 year life of both projects
(Montenegro Project, Loan 1370-YU, was included in the same appraisal report)
US$100 million dollars would be generated through exports (in 1976 prices).
It is possible that this project would exceed that amount and realize over
US$250 million over the next 20 years, in 1984 prices.-   This is because a
larger portion of production is exported than was expected at appraisal.
Added to this amount wnold be the foreign exchange savings from reduced
imports of wheat, milk, and other crops such as corn and barley that are
produced as a result of this project.
6.05     Economic Analysis.  Quantifiable benefits include (i) incremental
production from the individual sector, (ii) incremental value added from
processing, and (iii) value added from cold storage investment. Costs
quantified include all investments and operating costs, excluding transfer
payments such as taxes and subsidies. The outputs of wheat, barley, tomatoes,
wine grapes, lambs, and tobacco from the individual sector and of meat, milk,
apples, processed fruits and vegetables and the inputs of fertilizer,
insecticide, concentrate feed, energy and raw fruits and vegetables have been
priced as tradeabtes based on their border equivalent values or the actual
ex-factory export prices (excluding subsidies) received, whichever was
applicable. The investment costs have been adjusted by the appropriate
conversion factors for each year and, where appropriate, economic prices were
forecast using the World Bank September 1984 commodity price projections as a
basis. The analysis was done in constant 1985 terms.
6.06     The overall rate of return, based on the aggregated costs and
benefits is 15.1X, compared to 25.6Z at appraisal. The appraisal report did
not present rates of return for individual components, but the PCR mission
estimates the following:
i/ Based on the estimates provided by the plants for their 1985 plans and
expected export earnings.
2/ In 1976 prices, deflated by manufacturing unit value, this would be US$166
million.

VII. Institutional Performance
A. Institutional Design and Performance and Institutional Building
7.01     The Bank loan was-channelled through SBS which on-lent to the
investors, social and individual sector subborrowers. Therefore, SBS was
responsible for appraising and supervising the implementation of investments
under the project. The Agricultural Operations Department in SBS had
expertise in agriculture, livestock, irrigation, and economic and financial
analysis after having been responsible for implementing the first
Agroindustries Project. Additional appointments were made as required under
the Loan Agreement, and a supervision and monitoring system was established
(para 3.30). Nevertheless, during the course of the project, a number of
changes occurred in the financial situation and in the physical implementation
of the subprojects that SBS should have signalled to the Bank for discussion.
Instead, these changes were discovered by Bank supervision and PCR missions
only toward the end of the project, or after its completion. These changes
include the additional equipment for the cold store (para 3.07, 7N2), and the
apple processing plant (para 4.07, FN2), the investors' equity contribution
being financed from Federal Funds (para 3.28), the change to a longer grace
period for subborrowers (para 5.12), ind the financial deterioration of the
investors' operations and consequent need to reschedule their subloans
(para 5.05).
7.02     In spite of these important omissions, SBS does deserve credit for
the frequency, timeliness and detail of its reporting, and particularly for
the preparation of the PCR, which was very thorough and proved helpful to the
Bank mission. SBS was also conscientious in monitoring the subprojects and
responded to the changed demand for individual sector sub-loans to increase
the amounts available for mechanization (para 3.09). On evaluation, however,
SBS should consider carrying out either through its own staff or by hiring
consultants specialized in the field, periodic farm surveys in the individual
sector to assess various credit policies. In addition, annual evaluation of
social sector sub-borrowers, particularly those unable to meet loan payments,
should become a regular feature of SBS' own agricultural portfolio review.
Experience under the project has increased SBS' Agricultural Operations
Department ability to appraise, advise on procurement and supervise ongoing
and possible future projects.
1/ The main reason for the difference between the economic and financiaL
rates of return is the difference in economic and financial pricr ror
wheat and barley, which are significant in the calculations of benefits.



-3.-
7.03     Agrokombinats, BOALs and Work Organizations of Associated Labor
provide services in planning and supplies to associated farmers. Individual
farmers who choose to associate for the season can receive the benefit of the
kombinats' extension service to help in subprojects planning and
implementation and receive through the Kombinat agricultural inputs such as
seeds, Certilizers, tools or machine service. In return, these associated
farmers must market at least part of their produce through the Kombinat.
Additional attention should be given to the system of input delivery to ensure
that all farmers, unassociated as well as associated, have equal access. As a
relatively small proportion (about 15%) of this loan was directed at the
individual sector, this was not a major issue of the Project.
7.04     Credit.  The mission was informed by SBS that in Macedonia farmers
have access to credit either by association with Agrokombinats or directly
from SBS system. SBS, the apex bank in Macedonia, now has a policy of
allowing all Basic Banks to lend directly to individuals on a cash basis (cash
loan and repayment), but only three of the more than twenty Basic Banks have
chosen or have experienced demand to make loans this way. This may be because
Basic Banks prefer to lend through Kombinats in order to minimize their own
administrative costs and risks or it may be because the individual farmer
feels less risk by knowing that the Kombinat has guaranteed his sub-loan. In
any case, direct loans to individuals represent a small amount.1" Access to
inputs and credit terms, conditions and availability to non-associated farmers
should be further examined in any future loans to ensure that all farmers have
equal access to credit. Some of these issues have been addressed in the
Fertilizer Sector Loan and the Montenegro Regional Development Project.
B. Performance of the Bank
7.05     The Bank's initiative to finance agroindustry in Macedonia was timely
and constructive. This lending operation was based on previous experience of
Bank's financing agroindustry and primary production. It corresponded to
Macedonia's comparative advantage for fruit and vegetable production and to
the priority to be given to less developed regions. The project's design
attempted to integrate production and processing and to improve cooperation
between the social and individual sectors.
7.06     Project appraisal adequately dealt with and supported the latest
technology in both primary production and related processing. While the
investments were generally suited to the availability of supplies, some of the
subprojects were over-designed. This is true of Gostivar slaughterhouse,
which had processing equipment installed in an operation that had neither the
experience, sufficient suitable raw material, nor proven market demand (para
4.05). It is also possible that the capacity of Prilep dairy may exceed raw
material availability and equipment to produce other dairy products may have
been included without sufficient consideration of market constraints (para
4.09, 4.24). The appraisal also underestimated the need for marketing and,
therefore, few arrangements were made to support this most important area of
1/ Information from SBS on Loan 2039-YU Macedonia III shows that about Dinar
15 million were lent by Basic Banks directly to individuals out of a total
Dinar 956 million for investments by the individual sector under the Loan.

an agroindustries project. An exception to this was the training/visit of
plant managers to the United States to expose them to marketing
possibilities. This was an innovative and ultimately useful exercise
organized by Bank supervision staff (para 4.25). In addition, during the
course of implementation changes were made in subproject scope and design. In
the case of Sveti-Nikole Dry Vegetable Plant, SBS and the subborrower
requested a reduction in plant capacity due to market considerations. Because
the reduction represented 60X of the plai.t's intake capacity, the Bank
requested a new feasibility study and, on the basis of the study, agreed to
the reduced size.
7.07     At the same time, however, several subborrowers expanded their plants
during the construction period by making separate arrangements with the
contractor. Supervision missions discovered this only after the fact and
generally advised caution, particularly for Resen, to concentrate on marketing
the output from existing plants and to concentrate on improving management to
handle the more complex plants. This should have been done by SBS own
supervision activities.
7.08     Bank supervision missions were not provided with adequate financial
data to review financial conditions of the subborrowers and supervision
reports did not reflect the financial problems of the social sector
subborrowers discussed in paras 5.05 and 5.06. Aside from this, Bank
supervision of the project was good. Missions had appropriate specialists and
staff continuity and were scheduled on a regular basis throughout the
project. As early as two months after loan effectiveness, the second
supervision mission went out and emphasized the need to employ procurement
consultants, on which iBS was in default at that time. Throughout the project
supervision missions made comments and contributed to procurement issues and
towards the end of the implementation period, supervision m'.isions pointed out
to the Borrower important issues including marketing, accr nting, quality and
raw product control, and training.
VIII.  Conclusions and Recomm  tlations
8.01     The project's physical and instituti-o- b':lding goals were generally
attained. They included the installation a--. rehabilitation or expansion of
social sector agroindustries, subloans tc andividual sector subborrowers,
reinforcement of SBS' project implementir! unit, and creation of an improved
monitoring and evaluation system. The. completion of physical implementation
of the social sector installations was delayed and thus at the time of the PCR
mission, the judgments on their operations are necessarily based on brief
impressions at the earliest stages of their operation.
Lessons Learned
8.02     One of the most important lessons learned from the review of this
Project is the need for financial discipline with respect to establishing and
maintaining prudent capital structures for the investments and for the
subborrowers. Particularly in a period of rapid devaluation, inflation and



-39-
high interest rates, subborrowers and SBS must take care to observe the
financial covenants designed to preserve the financial viability of the
enterprises and the Bank should ensure, in any future lending, that guidelines
established with respect to equity contribution and cash flow requirements of
the subborrowers are sufficient to maintain a viable capital structure and to
service their debts and that these guidelines, or covenants, are monitored and
respected throughout the project period.
8.03     The situation is now precarious for these subborrowers and all have
requested from SBS refinancing of their World Bank subloans. Any future
involvement of the World Bank or of SBS with the subborrowers should be based
on a thorough review of SBS' portfolio which should examine, for each
subborrower in need of financing:
(a) recommended actions to improve procurement (of raw material),
technical performance, management, planning and budgeting and
marketing activities;
(b)  realistic projections of market demand and prices for the processed
products;
(c)  realistic estimates of likely future financial viability;
(d)  estimates of financing requirements;
(e) recommendations for restructuring capital structure of plants.
Any further Bank involvement in agroindutries should be based on a sound
action program, resulting from this portfolio review, to deal with the
financially viable plants as well as with those unlikely to survive on their
own.
8.04     In addition, any future Bank involvement with SBS should be preceded
by a review of SBS's internal procedures for managing its portfolio and should
be based on a program to improve its portfolio management.
8.05     Timely and frequent supervision was useful.  The missions occurred
about every six months throughout project implementation and had input on
procurement matters and marketing questions, gave advice on management issues,
and arranged for training trips connected with marketing. In general, the
Bank should make an effort to continue regular supervision missions with some
emphasis on staff continuity. This has benefits for the Borrower, the
subborrower and the Bank. In addition, however, Bank supervision missions
should wozk with SBS on monitoring the financial situation of the subborrowers.
8.06     The individual sector farmers clearly responded to credit
availability and financial opportunity. With proper evaluation by SBS, more
information could have been gathered which could have affected lending
policies on interest rate and lending criteria. As it was, SBS did respond to
the increased demand for mechanization by requesting and arranging for more
funds to be available for subloans for this purpose. The individual sector



-40-
has potential to develop still further and the Bank and SBS may want to
finance this development. Future efforts should be accompanied by efforts to
evaluate the subloans through farm surveys, carried out either by SBS or by
consultants hired by SBS, so as to continue to meet the needs and encourage
development of this sector.
8.07     Finally, because the analysis in this report was based on only one
year of actual operation and future plans for the social sector investments,
the Bank may want to reassess the impact of the Project several years from
now, after the plants have been in operation for some time.
