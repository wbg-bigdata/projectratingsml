INTERNATIONAL BANL FOR RECONSTIUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECONMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A
PROPOSED LOAN TO THE
REPUBLIC OF IRAQ
FOR A GRAIN STORAGE PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and reconmmendation on a proposed
loan to the Republic of Iraq for the equivalent of US$400. million to
finance the foreign exchange cost of a grain storage project designed
to improve Iraq's grain storage and handling capacity. The loan would
have a tenm of 25 years, including 6-3/4 years of grace, with interest
at 7-1/4 percent per annum.
PAfiT I - THE ECONIOMY
2.        The last economic report on Iraq was distributed to the Executive
Directors on August 26, 1971 (EJA-35a).   An updating mission went to Iraq
in April 1972. It is expected that a full economic mission will be
mounted in the fall of this year.
3.        The 1958 revolution established a republican form of government
in Iraq and initiated a decade of fundamental social and political change.
The landowner and entrepreneurial classes steadily lost their political
and economic influence as successive governments introduced comprehensive
land reforms and gradually assumed control of the larger commercial and
industrial enterprises. This gradual but fundamental transition to a
socialistic economic system, accompanied by frequent changes of government,
resulted in a lower rate of growth than Iraq's economic potential would have
permitted. The present military Ba'athist government, in power since 1968,
has consolidated its position and is giving increased attention to domestic
economic and social reforms.
4.        Iraq's GNP rose by about 5-1/2 percent annually in the late 196Ots,
below the level achieved in the early 1960's, mainly because of slow
growth in the oil and agricultural sectors and a depressed level of invest-
ment activity both in the public and private sectors. Between 1966-70, oil
prodaction increased by only 11 percent (i.e., by less than 3 percent annually),
while over the first Five-Year Plan period (1965/66-1969/70), agricultural
output rose at an average rate of only about 2.5 percent annually -- below
the rate of population growth. Industrial output (excluding oil) rose more
rapidly in the late 1960's but the share of this sector remained at only



about 10 percent of GDP, and only 60 percent of the ID 175 million
allocated to industry was actually 3pent in the first plan period.
Total investment in Iraq grew by about 5 percent annually between
1965-70.  By 1970 investment was equivalent to about 18 percent of
GNP compared with gross national savings equivalent to about 21 percent.
5.        The public sector's relative importance in the economy has
risen considerably in recent years as central government expenditures
reached about 40 percent of GDP by fiscal year 1970/71. Public oonsumption
accounted for over a third of total consumption, while government investment
(not including public enterprises) accounted for well over 50% of total
investment. In the fiscal years 1966/67-1970/71, total government revenues
increased at an average annual rate of 15 percent (in current prices), while
current expenditures rose by about 13 percent and capital expenditures by
about 9 percent annually. The overall budgetary deficit declined somewhat
as a share of GDP, falling to about 5 percent in 1970/71.
6.        The performance of the Iraqi economy improved considerably in
calendar year 1971 due mainly to a large rise in oil income. This led to
a substantial rise in both investment and current expenditures by the
government and   stronger fiscal and balance of payments positions.   At
the same time there were encouraging indications that progress was being
made in overcoming administrative and other problems which had been
constraining Iraq's development program. However the situation changed
sharply in 1972 with the fall in oil prodaction in the northern fields and
the consequent nationalization of the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC).
7.        The Iraqi econony is dependent on oil which, in 1971, provided
close to one-third of national output, nearly 40 percent of exports and
more than half of government revenues. Durirg the 1960's the growth of
crude oil production averaged only about 5 percent per year, compared to
over 10 percent for all Middle Eastern producers. This was due to low
and declining levels of investment by IPG, resulting from a protracted
dispute with the government going back to 1961, when IPC's concessions
in all non-producing areas of Iraq, including the proven North Rumeila
oilfield, were withdrawn. A large part of IPC's former concession area
was later awarded to the government-owned Iraq National Oil Company (INOC),
established in 1964. In recent years, INOC has been developing new fields
in North Rumeila with cooperation from East European countries and foreign
firms on a contractual rather than concessionary basis.
8.        Throughout the past decade the government and IPC have inter-
mittently reached agreement on a number of issues concerning mainly the
company's payments for current production. A major boost in these
payments resulted from an agreement signed in October 1970 which provided
for increased production from IPC's southern field and the 1971 Tehran
and Tripoli agreements which yielded substantially higher international



-3 -
oil prices. Early in 1972, IPC curtailed production from a daily
average of about 1,900,000 barrels in January to about 1,400,000 barrels
in March and April. After inconclusive discussions Iraq nationalized
IPC's assets on June 1, 1972. Mediation under the auspices of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries led to a settlement on
March 1, 1973 which provided for the reciprocal payment of US$340 million
by the IPC group to Iraq and the delivery by Iraq to IPC of 15 million
tons of oil (valued at about $300 million at current prices). In addition
IPC transferred to Iraq the assets of the Mosal Petroleum Company and
undertook to raise the annual production of the Basrah Petroleum Company
to 80 million tons by 1976.
9.        Although precise figures are not available, it is estimated that
total oil production fell from nearly 8L million tons in 1971 to an
estimated 67 million tons in calendar 1972. Although sales (14 million
tons) from the nationalized oilfields in the second half of 1972 were at
concessionary prices and on barter or semi-barter terms, the other oil
(53 million tons) was sold at very favorable prices so that oil revenues
as a whole may have fallen only slightly from around ID 297 million in
1971 to around ID 280 million (US$850 million). Overall, the fiscal
situation is less tight than had been anticipated, at least in the short
run. Past oil revenues have made possible an accumulation of gross
reserves, which at the end of March 1973 stood at about $1.0 billion,
equivalent to sixteen months imports at the 1971 level. Iraq has made
intensive efforts to open up new markets for the nationalized oil.   There
are good prospects for the early achievement of a record level of oil
revenues with the reopening of traditional markets following the March
settlement and the agreement reached with Syria in January 1973 and Lebanon
in March 1973 on the transit of Iraqi oil.
10.       The agricultural sector discussed in Part III of this report
is next to oil in its importance to Iraq's economy. It accountsfor about
21 percent of GDP, employs 55 percent of the labor force and provides the
greater part of the country's non-oil exports.
11.       Iraq has a amall and unsophisticated manufacturing sector, which
contributes around 10 percent to GDP and employs less than 5 percent of
the total labor force. The major industries are foodstuffs, beverages,
textiles, clothing, petroleum refining and building materials. Most of
them rely on imported materials, produce only for the domestic market
and receive protection through tariffs and import quotas. One impediment
to the growth of this sector is the shortage of trained manpower.
Petroleum-based and other chemical industries have considerable potential
for further development.



- 4 -
12.       The transport system consists of river transport on the Tigris
and alphrates, about 2,300 km of railways whose efficiency is reduced
by the two-gauge system and a heavy backlog of replacement needs and
about 10,000 Im of roads, of which less than half are paved for all-
weather use. Traffic demands on the rail and road systems are increasing.
Investment is required to increase the capacity of the present network
and extend it into the more remote parts of the country. A road transport
study being prepared under the 1966 road project is expected to identify
priorities for road construction. Meanwhile, the government plans to
complete the system of main trunk roads linking the major economic centers
of north and south Iraq.
13.       Although Iraq is an oil-producing country, its per capita GNP,
around $320 in 1970, is relatively low. Income disparities between rural
and urban areas, as well as between regions, are substantial.   In recent
years population growth (over 3 percent a year) and urban migration have
resulted in high unemployment particularly in urban areas where employment
opportunities have not kept pace with production growth. Social services
and education facilities are not well developed and substantial infra-
structural investment in agriculture and the rural sector is needed. The
government is faced with the task of diversifying the economy and creating
additional income and employment at a time when the available managerial
and technical manpower limits the country's capacity to prepare and
implement development projects.
14.       In the last few years Iraq's reliance on external financing
for public investment has been modest. The total amount of external
public debt stood at approximately $454 million at the end of 1972,
mostly in the form of long-term loans at relatively low interest. Of
this, 26 percent was owed to the USSR and another 25 percent to Kuwait.
The debt service ratio is low (2 percent in 1971) and especially with
the prospects for increased oil revenues, there can be no doabt of Iraq's
ability to undertake additional external borrowing.
15.       The trend towards increasing reliance on bilateral assistance
from East European countries was accentuated by the IPC nationalization.
In September 1972, for instance, the USSR agreed to let Iraq repay all
utilized credits (amounting so far only to a small proportion of the $394
million offered) in crude oil during the period June 1972 to December 31,
1980. In the same month the German Democratic Republic agreed to increase
its offtake of crude oil from 300,000 tons in 1972/73 to 600,000 tons by
1974/75, within the framework of a US$84 million loan made in 1969.



- 5 -
Similar agreements were reached with other East European countries and
with "third bloc" countries such as Brazil and India. Other loan agree-
ments concluded since June 1972, include a $130 million short-term credit
from the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries; a short-term
loan of $15 million, a medium-term loan of $29 million and a long-term
loan of $78 million from France (the last two in the form of export credits).
Most of this bilateral and short-term financing has been and is expected
to continue to be for oil and industrial investments. There is little or no
prospect for foreign private capital, except suppliers' credits. Long-term
finance for agricultural development, the development of human resources and
basic infrastructure such as transport, has not been available from bilateral
sources or through suppliers' credits, and thus is likely to be sought fro.,
sources such as the Bank.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN IRAQ
16..     The Bank has made loans totalling $105.-7.million to Iraq over a period
of 23 years.  The first four loans were for flood control (1950), roads (1966),
telecommunications (1971) and education (1972). -The fifth loan of $hQ milliw. for
the Lower Khalis Irrigation project was signed in late January 1973, and is ezpected tz
be declared eEective shrtly. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank
loans as of April 30, 1973 and notes on the execution of ongoing projects.  There
have been no IFC investments in Iraq and none are being considered at this time.
17.      After the first loan in 1950, Iraq did not seek further assist-
ance from the Bank for a long time, partly because foreign exchange require-
ments for public investment were met from oil revenues. An increase in
public investment in the mid-1960's led to a brief revival of interest in
Bank lending which resulted in the roads project. Over the past five years
the government has expressed further interest in Bank assistance in key
sectors. The telecommunications loan was the first project to result from
this renewed interest.
18..     While it is expected that Iraq will continue to earn substantial
oil revenues, most parts of the country are at an early stage of development
and the per capita income is relatively low for an oil-producing country.
Substantial resources are required to build up adequate public services and
create additional sources of income and employment and to diversify
the econony.      Progress under the current Development Plan has been cons-
trained by limited capacity in project identification, preparation and manage-
ment. Conscious of these shortcomings, Iraq recognizes the need to make
greater use of organizations like the Bank for training and technical assist-
ance. In the last two years, it has taken full advantage of courses offered
by the Economic Development Institute which has also agreed to spon-
sor  an   agriculture course in Baghdad later this year.  Iraq is also making
greater use than in the past of foreign consultants and contractors for its
development projects.



- 6 -
19.       Iraq is creditworthy and Bank lending is justified not only
because of Irao's low per capita income but also because it can serve
as an instrument for providing technical assistance in project preparation
and implementation. In recent discussions Iraqi officials have indicated
their continuing interest in project lending over the next four to five
years; for the more distant future the Iraqi authorities have requested
technical assistance for projects which they would themselves finance.
A program for future cooperation with the Bank is being discussed in Iraq
and will be followed by discussions with the Bank later this year. Mean-
while work is proceeding on projects already in the pipeline.
20.       The prospective lending program gives particular attention to
agriculture, education, transport and communications. The education project
and Lower Khalis Irrigation project were prepared with assistance fz m the
Bank's Cooperative Programs with UNESCO and FAO. The proposed grain storage
project was prepared by Iraqi consultants in collaboration with a U.K. firm
and in consultation with Bank staff. The Bank is also helping with the
preparation of a second roads project, which may be ready for Board considera-
tion by late FY74, followed in FY75 by an irrigation project in Northern Iraq.
Other projects in the agricultural sector have been identified and preparatory
work on them should begin in the near future. The Bank has provided technical
assistance with the preparation of terms of reference for a comprehensive
study of Iraq's land and water resources whtich should provide a basis for
assessing the priorities to be accorded to proposals to extend irrigation
and drainage and bring new lands under cultivation. It is expected that the
Bank will be involved in the implementation of the study.
PART III - THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR
General Setting
21.       About 28 percent or 12 million hectares of the total land area
in Iraq is potentially suitable for cultivation of which at present only
8.5 million is cropped. In any one year, only about 50 percent of the
cultivable area is cultivated because under the present system an area
remains fallow in alternate years. Most of the cropped area is given over
to wheat and barley in the winter, while rice, cotton and vegetables are
grown on a small scale in the summer. Dates grown in the southern part
of the Tigris-Euphrates basin are an important export crop.
22.       Annual precipitation in the mountains and foothills of the
northern provinces occurs mostly in the winter season and averages about
1000 mm per year. The potential cultivable area in this "dryland zone",
where rainfed cultivation is practiced, is about 3 million hectares.
Despite the low rainfall and difficult topography of the mountains in the
northeast, about 300,000 ha. are devoted to wheat and barley production.



- 7 -
Over the next decade, an additional 100,000 hectares are expected to come
under wheat production, now that peace has been restored with the Kurds.
The piedmont zone to the east of the river Tigris is a rainfed area support-
ing a substantial livestock population. Annual rainfall over the remaining
three-quarters of Iraq averages less than 100 mm. Outside of the "dryland
zone", the potentially cultivable area is about 8 million hectares provided
irrigation water is made available. 4.5 million hectares are presently
irrigated from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, south of the rainfed zone.
23.       Despite its share of GDP, the agricultural sector is under-
developed and its productivity is amongst the lowest in the world. The
major constraints on agricultural development include reliance on the
vagaries of rainfall and insufficient water distribution and control
facilities, complicated by exc6ssive soil salinity and poor drainage.
Soil salinity is so severe in some areas that until the soils are leached
and proper drainage provided, the effect of modern farming inputs would
be negated. These constraints are aggravated by the traditional reluctance
of farmers to use modern agricultural techniques, insufficient credit
facilities and extension services, and inadequate investment planning and
implementation.
24.      The government is aware of these problems and has accorded high
priority to agriculture in the current Development Plan (1970-74), which
calls for extensive drainage works to combat soil salinity as well as
increases in the area under irrigation and in cropping intensity, in order
to achieve self-sufficiency in agricultural production -- particularly of
wheat and barley.  The Plan allocates nearly 30 percent of total investment
for agriculture, including support for the grain storage program. The
government has shown considerable interest in developing model projects,
e.g. the Lower Khalis project, and in improving all basic agricultural
inputs. The achievement of Plan targets would represent a major improve-
ment in the administration's capacity for project preparation and implement-
ation.
Foodgrain Production
25.      Wheat and barley production has been marked by wide annual
fluctuations and relatively low yields. Wheat production rose from 0.8
million tons in 1966 to 1.2 million tons in 1968, followed by a drop to
about 0.5 million tons in 1971 because of poor rainfall recovering to
nearly 2 million tons in 1972. Barley production has been more stable,
but has fluctuated between 0.7 million and 0.9 million tons in 1970 and 71.
Iraq, an exporter of cereal until the early 1950's, imported about 0.4



- 8 -
million tons of wheat and barley in 1969 and 1970. Imports rose to 1.4
million tons in 1971 because of the very poor crop. Over the last five
years, foodstuffs have constituted, in value, about half of Iraq's consumer
goods imports. While the magnitude of total foodgrain imports is expected
to decline as a result of benefits derived from current development schemes,
Iraq is likely to remain a net importer of grains in the foreseeable future.
Based on consumption trends and projections of future production increases,
imports are expected to stabilize at about 750,000 tons per annum over the
next ten years.
Grain Board
26.       The responsibility for handling this substantial volume of grain
imports rests with the Grain Board, part of the State Organization for Grain
and Enterprises. The Board presently owns and operates eight modern silos
used. mainly to store grain purchased from the cooperative farms. The Board
is also responsible for quality control and for determining, under the guidance
of the Ministry of Economics, pricing policies and marketing strategies. All
new grain storage projects are prepared by Grain Board staff. The Board is
expected to be largely self-sufficient financially within certain guidelines
laid down by the government, which has generally tended to safeguard consumer
interests by limiting the prices charged by the Board for grain sold to the
state-owned General Company of Flour Mills. Part of any trading profit is
retained by the Board and part is passed on to the Development Plan fund.
Funds for new projects are provided in the main from budgetary allocations.
The Boardts staff are well qualified and experienced and its operations are
efficiently managed.
27.       In the past due primarily to its lack of storage facilities, the
Grain Board has purchased only nominal amounts of domestically-produced
grain, most of which has been marketed by private traders whose handling
and distribution methods are poor and whose storage facilities are frequently
open courtyards exposed to the elements and rodents. In May 1972 a resolution
of the Council on Regulating Trade gave formal expression to the policy currently
being pursued by the Grain Board of participating more actively in the domestic
grain trade. To do this the Grain Board must have more storage facilities,
even taking account of the 10 new silos under construction with bilateral aid.
The government's aim is to enable the Grain Board to purchase enough of the
domestically-produced grain by 1980 to supply the state-owned flour mills and
at least 10 percent of the requirements of the private mills in addition to
handling imports. In this way the Board would have a more significant impact
on producer prices. Private traders would still handle nearly 70 percent of
domestic production but they would face stronger competition from the Board
and be compelled to reduce costs and profit margins.

PARD IV - THE PFDJECT
Project History
28.       The need for additional modern grain storage facilities and an
improved grain marketing system was identified during an economic mission
to Iraq in late 1968. A feasibility study was completed in 1971 by the
government's consultants, Iraq Consult (Iraq) and Scicon International (UK),
using terms of reference prepared by the Bank and with periodic guidance
provided by the Bank. Appraisal took place in January/February 1972,
followed by further discussions between July and October on the extent
of the grain storage requirements. Negotiations were held early in April
1973. The Iraqi delegation, led by the Economic Adviser to the Revolutionary
Command Council, Dr. Fakri Qaddori, included Mr. El-Amar, Director-General
of the Grain Board and Dr. Zuhair Al-Dhahir, Director-General (Agriculture)
in the Ministry of Planning.
Project Description
29.       The main features of the proposed project are summarized in
Annex III, and described in detail in the report "Iraq: Appraisal of
Grain Storage Project", (hiport No. 150a-PAo dated May 22, 1973), which
is being circulated separately to the Executive Directors. Briefly, the
proposed project consists of the construction and equipping of 14 silos and
expansion of 4 existing silos for a total additional capacity of 540,000
tons, and the construction of a 20,000-ton transfer terminal silo at the
port of Um Qasr. Eleven of the new units would be tenrinal silos, providing
high storage capacity and a variety of handling services, for a total of
468,000 tons. The remainder would be less sophisticated gathering silos
with individual capacities up to 16,000 tons. The project also provides
for engineering consultants to assist with the design and construction of
the new silo capacity, technical assistance and equipment for a mechanized
inventory control and communications system, the employment of economic
consultants to undertake a comprehensive study of grain pricing and marketing,
and a training program for silo staff.
30.       Under the proposed project, the Board would be able to purchase
about 33 percent of the marketed domestic production of grain by 1980, most
of -which would come from the state-controlled cooperatives. A linear
programming model was devised to calculate the size and location of additional
silos sufficient to provide, by 1980, a peak storage requirement of 928,000
tons, including expanded capacity at Basrah port silo to handle grain imports.
Tpking into account the Grain Board's (by then) 18 silos (264,000 tons),
warehouse storage (78,000) and storage available to it in government flour
mills (26,ooo), the balance of 560,000 tons would be provided under the project.



- 10 -
31.       The total cost of the project, net of taxes and excluding
interest during construction, is estimated at about $92.4 million with
a foreign exchange cost of about $43 million (48 percent).   The proposed
loan would cover the foreign exchange costs of the constraction and equipping
of the silos and engineering consultancy services. Iraq would cover, besides
the local currency costs of these items, the full cost of the design and
implementation of the mechanized inventory control and communications system,
the grain marketing and pricing study and training.
32.       It is expected that it would take four years to construct all
the project facilities following an 18-month period for design and contractor
selection. Within the Grain Board, the Projects Department, which is
currently implementing two bilateral aid projects, would be responsible
for the construction of project facilities and the Technical Department for
general project administration. Both departments are headed and staffed by
qualified engineers. Four additional engineers would be recruited by the
Projects Department.
Procurement and Disbursements
33.       Procurement of works or goods exceeding $100,000 would be by
international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines.
However three of the silo extensions and the expansion of handling capacity
at the Kut, Baghdad and Basrah silos may call for the negotiated purchase of
additional mechanical-electrical equipment from the original suppliers,
all of whom are from Bank member-countries or Switzerland, subject to the
prior approval of the Bank in each case. The total which may be exempted
from international competitive bidding for this reason would be $2.5 million.
There are no preferential tariffs between Iraq and member-countries that would
affect bid evaluations nor is there any domestic manufacture of silo
mechanical-electrical equipment. Procurement of works and goods costing
less than $100,000 would be on the basis of local competition. The silo
works would be grouped geographically into contracts for three or four
silos covering both civil works and electro-mechanical equipment, each
costing about $10.0 million.
Rate of Return
34.       An economic rate of return of 14 percent is expected from the
project. Overall, the expansion of the Grain Board's activities would
benefit the economy by about $11 million per annum at full project
development. This benefit would be made up of a reduction in storage
losses of two to three percent for the additional grain handled by the
Board, a reduction in marketing costs by almost 50 percent for both bulk
and bagged grain, a reduction in intermal transportation costs through
bulk handling, a reduction in ocean shipping costs and increased production
stimulated by a 14 percent increase in farmgate prices made possible by the
Grain Board's deeper market penetration. On the basis of the projected
farmgate price increases, the project would help provide an annual incremental
income of $38 each for some 75,000 farmers participating in the cooperative
societies.

PART V - LEGAL lSINST1INTS AND AUTHORITY
35.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Republic of Iraq and the
Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III, Section
4(iii) of the Articles of Agreement, the draft Supplementary Letter on
Procurement, the draft Supplementary Letter on the operations of the Grain
Board, and the text of a Resolution approving the proposed Loan are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately. The draft Loan
documents generally follow the pattern of documents for similar projects.
36.       I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Bank.
PART VI - RECOMMENDATION
37.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Loan.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION -t
Ln No. 457          Road Project; US$ 19 million loan of July 22, 1966;
Closing Date:   June 30, 1973.
Nearly all construction under the project has been completed save for
some roadworle and bridge construction on the Ramadi-Haditha road which are not
expected to be completed before the closing date of June 30, 1973, when an
estimated $0.9 million (5 percent) of the loan will remain undisbursed. It is
not expected that the Government will request a further extension of the
c'lsing date. The Government has requested that some of the projected
undisbursed balance be used to purchase additional road maintenance equipment
and, subject to Bank scrutiny of the bid documents, this would be acceptable.
Basic data collectionfhr the Road Transport Study has been completed. It is
expected that the computation will be completed by September, 1973 and the
road investment program prepared by the end of 1973.
Ln No. 788          Telecommunications Project I; US$ 27.5 million loan of
October 27, 1971; Closing Date: December 31, 1977.
Satisfactory progress has been made with the placing of contracts for
the microwave equipment and associated civil works and the long-distance
switchgear. Tenders for the earth satellite facilities will be invited shortly.
Partly as a result of currency revaluations, the contract for the microwave
equipment will substantially exceed the amount allocated in the loan agreement.
Higher than originally estimated contract costs may be expected on some of the
items for which contracts have not yet been awarded. Supplementary bank
financing may be recommended.
Ln No. 846          Education Project; US$ 12.9 million loan of June 30, 1972;
Closing Date:  December 31, 1977.
The Loan became effective on December 18, 1972. The Director of the
Project Implementation Unit took up his post in August 1972, and the Inter-
Ministerial Coordinating Committee has been set up.   The Government is in the
process of selecting consultant architects. The project is expected to be
completed according to schedule and within the costs estimated in the Appraisal
Report.
Ln. No. 878         Lower Khalis Irrigation Project; US$ 40 million loan of
January 25, 1973; Closing Date: June 30, 1979.
The effective date of April 25, 1973 has been extended to May 25, 1973
to enable the Government to submit the ratification and other documents pertaining
to effectiveness to the Bank.

1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution and in particular to report any problems which
are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They should be
read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do not purport to present

PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS:       Silo construction contracts would be awarded
on the basis of international competitive
bidding in accordance with the Bank's guidelines
save that, for three silo extensions and expan-
sions of handling capacity, integration with
existing electrical-mechanical systems may call
for the negotiated purchase of equipment from
existing suppliers, all of whom are from Bank
member-countries or Switzerland. Every except-
ion would be subject to the prior approval of
the Bank.  No more than $2.5 million of
equipment would be exempted from international
bidding.  The silo works would be grc ped
geographically into construction contracts,
each covering three to four silos. The total
value of each contract would be about US$10.0
million, without contingencies. Procurement of
all works or goods in excess of $100,000 would
be through international competitive bidding.
Procurement below $100,000 would be on the
basis of local competitive bidding. Procure-
ment of consultant services would be according
to the Bank's guidelines. Minor services or
items costing less than US$5,000 would be
procured directly; the total of such direct
procurement would be limited to US$100,000.
CONSULTANTS:                    A qualified engineering consulting firm would
be appointed to conduct soil and site investi-
gations, prepare detailed designs for the
silo structures and mechanical and electrical
layout, and prepare tender and contract docu-
ments. It is likely that a local consulting
firm working in collaboration with foreign
experts or an overseas consulting firm would be
appointed. Iraq would finance consultancy services
