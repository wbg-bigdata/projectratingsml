BANGKOK SITES AND SERVICES AND SLUM IMPROVEMENT PROJECT
I. SECTOR BACKGROUND
A. Bangkok Metropolis and the Urban Sector
1.01      Thailand's urban sector is characterized by a relatively low level
of urbanization, rapid growth and the predominance of Bangkok. Although
the slightly more than 7 million people living in urban centers account for
only 17% of the total population, Thailand's urban areas are growing at
approximately 5% per annum compared to a total population growth of about 2.5%
per annum. This rate will be sustained if not accelerated during the next
decade because of the diminishing supply of unoccupied agricultural land which
has absorbed a substantial proportion of the national population growth during
the post-war period.
1.02      Bangkok, with a 1977 population of 4.8 million and a growth rate
of 5% per annum, accounts for about half of the total urban population.
Bangkok's predominance is further emphasized in that it is 40 times larger
than the next largest city in Thailand, as well as being the national
capital and home to over 18,000 industrial firms. It is the main port and
transportation hub, commercial and financial center and regional headquarters
for a number of international agencies and multinational businesses. As a
result, Thailand's non-agricultural economy is concentrated in the city.
Although Bangkok accounts for only 10% of the total population, it contri-
buted 27% of national GDP in 1976, and Bangkok's Gross Regional Product per
capita (B 20,006) was 2.6 times greater than the Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) per capita (B7,582). The city provides other important attractions as
well: secondary and higher educational institutions are heavily concentrated
there, with about 60% of the nation's upper secondary and 85% of higher
education enrollments available to its 10% of the national population. The
physician to population ratio in Bangkok is approximately 20 times higher
than in the rest of Thai land. It is also the cultural center and location
of the main Royal Residence.
1.03      Bangkok has been the nation's capital since Ayuthia, the previous
capital 80 km to the north, was sacked by the Burmese in 1767. In 1782 the
city's founder, King Chakri (Rama I), moved the capital from Thonburi on the
western side of the Chao Phya River to its current site because of its
superior defensive qualities. Situated on the eastern side of a large loop
of the river, the city was protected from military attack by a swampy plain
to the east as well as by the river. The river provided access to the sea
and water for a system of canals (klongs) which served as the city's
principal transportation and drainage networks. The new city prospered.
During the reign of King Rama IV (1856), contacts with the west began to occur.
At this time the population was about 400,000, and the city had become an
important commercial center. Roads were constructed outwards, and the city



- 2 -
began to spread along these arteries. In the early 1950s the population
reached one million and by 1974 had climbed to four million. In recent years
natural increase and i-migration have contributed roughly equally to the
city's growth; average in-migration is now more than 100,000 per annum.
In 1972 the cities of Bangkok and Thonburi were joined to create a single
municipality. The2 city's urbanized area currently consists of approximately
220 sq km and spills into four provinces (changwats): Phra Nakorn, Thonburi,
Nonthaburi and Samut Praken.
1.04      Although Bangkok is well located for strategic and commercial
purposes, the characteristics of its site create development problems. The
city is built on an alluvial plain of geographically young clay. The heavy
impervious soil makes drainage difficult and hinders efficient operation of
septic tanks. The flatness of the site, averaging only 1 m above sea level,
and a ground water table rarely more than I m below the surface impose severe
constraints on the development of drainage and sewerage systems. The city has
developed in narrow strips along the transportation arteries, leaving large
land gaps undeveloped or utilized for rice paddies. Only during the last
two decades have land values in built-up areas risen to a level at which con-
struction of high-rise buildings with expensive foundations has been considered
economical.
1.05      Bangkok's modern dev(elopment has been neither effectively planned
nor controlled. A master plan for Bangkok to 1990 was submitted to the Thai
Government in 1960 and has been revised twice, once in 1969 by the City Plan-
ning Division of one of the city's municipalities and independently again in
1971 by the Department of Town and Country Planning in the Ministry of the
Interior. None of these plans has been followed consistently, partially due
to deficiencies in the Town and Country Planning Act of 1952; however, plan-
ning controls based on the municipality plan have been applied in some
sections of the city during recent years. A Plan currently being prepared in
accord with new planning legis'Lation enacted in 1975 will apply to the entire
city once it has been approved. The whole city is subject to building regu-
lations which have been effectively enforced for contractor-built buildings;
however, many of the structures in slum and squatter communities have been
built without formal approval.
1.06      The Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) was created in 1972
to consolidate urban management functions, particularly primary education,
garbage disposal and maintenance of local roads and waterways. The BMA
has experienced persistent management difficulties, and as in most large
metropolises, coordination has been weak among many of the local and national
agencies with major responsibi]Lities in the city. Bangkok's water is supplied
by the Metropolitan Water Works Authority (MWWA) which, along with the Metro-
politan Electricity Authority (MEA), is under the Ministry of the Interior.
The Highway Department and the Port Authority of Thailand, both under the
Ministry of Communications, are responsible for several major roads and
management of the port, respectively, while the Royal Irrigation Department of
the Ministry of Agriculture mai'ntains some of the larger canals. Housing,



-3-
industrial development, post-primary education and hospitals present a similar
picture of divided, often uncoordinated responsibility. The city's tax base
is weak, primarily because of negligible land real estate taxes. The taxation
system, which does not tax undeveloped prime land very heavily, is partially
responsible for t:he uneven pattern of development in Bangkok.
1.07      The unplanned nature of Bangkok's growth has produced predictable
deficiencies in basic infrastructure for water supply, sewerage, drainage and
transportation. About 30% of the population, mainly in the lower-income
groups, have no public water service, and adequate pressure can be maintained
in only about 20% of the serviced area, presenting severe constraints on water
consumption as well as fire fighting. Many families must resort to secondary
sources including rain water, vendors or other, usually unsafe sources,
particularly the polluted klongs. Bangkok's water supply system has a current
(1976) productive capacity of only about 1,200,000 cu m/day (1976), with 70% of
the water drawn from the Chao Phya River and the remainder from groundwater
sources. Expansion of this capacity to 2,273,000 cu m/day by mid-1978 is
planned under a program being cofinanced by the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank. The total capacity of the system is expected to be adequate
until about 1985; by then a second-stage expansion program will be launched.
Bangkok's water supply system has serious metering problems. A consultant
study in 1969 disclosed that about 60% of the installed water meters were not
functioning, and many others were operating poorly. A metering improvement
program was initiated in 1971 to correct the above situation and will be
continued in conjunction with expansion of the water supply. The current
tariff structure recovers less than 50% of the amortized cost of the system.
The ongoing Bank project is addressing the question of inadequate tariffs.
1.08      As noted earlier, the Bangkok area also experiences a severe drain-
age and sewage problem. There is no central sewerage system in Bangkok.
The most commonly employed waste disposal devices are septic tanks and cess-
pools with the effluent discharging into storm water drains or klongs. In-
efficient drainage, together with a high-water table and periodic flooding,
make water pollution a health hazard and aesthetic nuisance. Implementation
of a combined sewerage and drainage master plan completed in 1968 has pro-
ceeded piecemeal because of technical problems with the plan. Because of the
urgency of the situation, BMA has since 1976 started a small-scale drainage
program aimed at improving the flow in the klongs located in the northwestern
area of Bangkok (designated as Phase I in the above-mentioned master plan
study). Collection of solid waste generated at the rate of 12,000 cu m/day in
the metropolitan, area is rather inefficient, especially in high-density areas
where the accumulated garbage is thrown in nearby ditches or klongs.
1.09      Bangkcok is notorious for its traffic congestion and transportation
problems. The city's transportation system is characterized by a very low
proportion of space devoted to circulation (not more than 10% in the inner
core) and a road network dependent on a limited number of major roads with
only a few connecting links, particularly outside the central area's grid
network. Circuitous and time consuming road journeys are often necessary to
cover relatively short direct distances. Many roads follow filled-in klongs.
The absence of hierarchy among roads and frequent violation of traffic



- 4 -
regulations further aggravate the congestion. A major transportation study
outlining immediate traffic management measures and short-term investments as
well as a long-term strategy was completed in 1975 with technical assistance
from the Federal Republic of Germany. At the request of the Government, the
Bank is assisting in the preparation of a Traffic Management Project which
would include implementation of some of these short-term investments and of
policy measures directed toward improving public transport, restraining
private automobile use and reducing institutional fragmentation which has
impeded a comprehensive approach to transport planning and traffic management.
1.10      Bangkok is economically a very active city.  The private sector is
characterized by small firms, competition and price responsiveness. Approxi-
mately half of the industrial firms employ five persons or less, and about
half of the labor input is accounted for by firms with under 50 employees.
The city's manufacturing industries are quite diversified, although textiles
and apparel account for almost 30% of employment in industry. Basic metal
industries, including manufacture of metal products, machinery, transport
equipment and appliances, account for another 28%. Public sector employment
in Bangkok in the early 1970s was estimated by the Bank at slightly over 15%.
Unemployment rates have been unusually low, estimated at less than 2.5Z during
the first half of the 1970s. The highest level of unemployment is reported
to be among youth between the ages of 15-24. In 1975 the rate for that age
group was 3.6% compared to 1.6% for the total labor force. However, employ-
ment generation, particularly in the non-agricultural sector has been iden-
tified as a priority in Thai'Land's Fourth Plan (1977-81), as it is recognized
that land for the expansion of agricultural employment is becoming scarce.
It is inevitable that as this traditional source of employment absorption
(agricultural employment occupies about 70% of the labor force) dwindles, and
with non-agricultural employment concentrated in urban centers, primarily
Bangkok, it will not be long before the relatively low rural-urban migration
rates begin to show significant increases.
1.11      Because of the low unemployment level, absolute urban poverty
appears to be less widespread in Bangkok than in other Asian cities. The
national level of urban poverty is estimated at between 9 and 13%. 1/
However, wage rates in Bangkc,k are very responsive to demand and supply,
and some workers are prepared to accept very low pay as an alternative to
unemployment.
B. Housing Conditions in Bangkok
1.12      The growth of Bangkok's housing supply has been characterized by
moderate formal sector output catering to the upper and middle-income groups,
a very limited public program and prcliferation of inadequately serviced
1/   Compared to 9% in Korea, 10% in Papua New Guinea, 20% in Malaysia,
26% in the Philippines and 55% in Indonesia, according to Bank
statistics.

slums. The National Housing Authority (NHA) estimated that by 1980 there will
be a housing shortage of about 160,000 units for households earning less than
B 5,000 a month if current trends continue. During the past few years the
average number of new households has been about 30,000 a year while only
17,00-20,000 building permits for residential construction have been issued
annually.
1.13      The private formal sector builds primarily for households in the
upper third of the income distribution. Financing for this type of housing
is available from the Government Housing Bank (GHB) and commercial banks. The
GHB is a profit-making organization which lends to middle and upper-income
households and developers. Individuals may borrow to purchase, build, repair
or refinance a home or to buy land for housing. The terms for house purchase
are usually 5-15 years at 12% interest, with the mortgage covering up to 65%
of the appraised value. The GHB may participate in developments either by
partially financing developers or providing mortgage finance to purchasers.
The GHB's share of its target market is estimated at 15-30%. It receives an
average of 400 mortgage applications a month but can satisfy only about half
of these due to constraints on its resources. At the end of 1976, GHB had
total assets of B 1,972 million. During 1976, its equity increased from
B 180 million to Bi 231 million, and deposit liabilities grew from B 552 mil-
lion to B 1,655 million.
1.14      Commercial banks generally lend 50-65% of the appraised value of
properties at 15% interest for up to 10 years. When the bank has a financial
interest in the development, it may lend for as much as 80% of the property
value. Construction loans are also available on the basis of agreed credit
limits, generally for a period of one year.
1.15      Bangkok's low-income populace lives in a variety of housing situa-
tions.  Workers' housing is provided for a substantial number of employees at
levels varying from crude temporary shelters for construction workers to
fully developed estates for the employees of particular companies. Many
families, especially in the older sections of the city, live above their small
businesses in structures called "shop houses". During the 25 years prior to
the formation of NHA in 1973, the public sector produced an average of only
500 units a year. Public housing at current standards and costs is affordable
by the poor only because of substantial subsidies.
1.16      Slum settlements are the most important source of low-income
housing, accommodating over a million people or about 25% of Bangkok's total
population. In addition to extensive settlements with as many as 35,000
inhabitants, there are more than 100,000 people living in small clusters
of slum housing or in single dwellings scattered throughout the city. Slum
houses, typically wooden structures with galvanized iron roofs, are generally
structurally sound although often overcrowded. Almost a fifth of these
households do not pay rent for the land on which they live, while those who
do pay rent either have no formal tenure arrangements or have very short-term
agreements (usually 1-2 years).



- 6 -
1.17      Inadequate drainage and solid waste disposal are the major environ-
mental problems in the slums, contributing to health hazards. Ditches which
empty into klongs (canals) are the principal means of drainage. Garbage is
usually thrown into open spaces, klongs or ditches which overflow during the
rainy season. Garbage collection and pumping of septic tanks by municipal
authorities is impeded by lack of road access or even paved walkways as well
as by shortage of vehicles anc[ refuse containers. Most slums have septic
tanks for human waste disposal. Although the tanks are normally elevated,
leakages still sometimes occur during the rainy season. Water supply is
inadequate to the extent that even in a community as centrally located as
Klong Toey, adjacent to the port, two thirds of the residents purchase water
in containers. Households with piped water normally leave their taps open
all the time to receive water whenever the pressure is adequate.
1.18      Health conditions in slum communities reflect squalid environmental
conditions and the residents' poverty. A survey of 108 slum communities
carried out in 1976 by NHA indicated that 19% of the families had a member
sick at the time of the survey. In a study of King Petch, the first slum to
be improved in the project, 44% of the families had had a member sick during
the month prior to the survey. The major types of illnesses reported by
residents were colds and skin diseases; however, local nurses reported that
diseases endemic to the area also included malnutrition in children, intes-
tinal infection and respiratory diseases. An academic study of early child-
hood malnutrition in slum areas of Bangkok conducted in 1970-71 showed that in
terms of weight, height and head size, children in slum areas were appreciably
below the level of comparably aged middle class and rural children in the
early years of their lives as a result of malnutrition. The study hypothe-
sized that the above differences resulted from the inability of working
mothers to breastfeed their infants adequately.
1.19      Owner occupation is the most prevalent form of house tenure.  In
King Petch, for example, 55% of the houses are occupied by owners. Houses
frequently serve commercial and small-scale industrial as well as residential
purposes. In King Petch, about 30% of the dwellings are used in this manner,
including small-scale processing or manufacturing on subcontract with larger
concerns. Although incomes are low within these communities, unemployment is
relatively low and short-term. A census in Klong Toey in 1973, for example,
indicated that although 8% of the household heads were not employed at the
time of the survey, much of unemployment was due to recent completion of a job
and was probably transitory. Furthermore, 20% of the household heads had
second jobs, and 27% of their spouses earned income.
C.  National Housing Authority Programs
1.20      The NHA was formed in 1973 in response to the deteriorating housing
conditions by amalgamating four existing agencies concerned with public
housing. NHA assumed responsi'bility for about 12,300 housing units, approxi-
mately half of which were rental properties, and 6,400 plots of land. A



semi-autonomous state enterprise, NHA is responsible to a Cabinet-appointed
Board of Directors under the Ministry of Interior and managed by a Governor
appointed by the Board.
1.21      NRA's initial five-year program for 1976-80 is far too ambitious
for its capabilities, calling for 120,000 units in Bangkok. In practice,
NHA had completed only about 6,000 units by 1976 but was implementing schemes
in 1977 which will generate another 18,000 units. This acceleration of its
construction program is NHA's major accomplishment to date. Low-income
projects typically consist of walk-up flats of 35-50 sq m per unit. Several
recent schemes also provide middle-income housing which NRA hoped to sell
at a profit; however, it has experienced marketing problems competing with the
private sector in this price range.
1.22      In order to finance the $673 million five-year program and build up
an NBA revolving fund, the Government agreed to repay over a ten-year period
the principal and any interest over 7% on NHA borrowings. Because NHA units
are heavily subsidized, Government contributions must also finance the defi-
cits arising from the sale of units at less than cost. A major disadvantage
of this mechanism of transferring Government funds to NHA is that it does
not distinguish between contributions to a revolving fund and capital grants
required to finance the subsidized sale of units. The NRA's major market
borrowing has been a $50 million bond issue (at 5.5% interest for ten years)
sold under an unusual arrangement whereby commercial banks were allowed to
use legal reserves for their purchase.
1.23      NRA units have been heavily subsidized, with the subsidy levels
progressively related to tenants' incomes as follows:
Income Group
(B per month)                           Charges
A                    Rents and hire-purchase rates reflect only
(0-1500)                 estate management charges and 6% interest
on investment costs. The full cost of con-
struction and interest over 6% are borne
by NHA.
B                    NHA absorbs 50% of the construction cost
(1501-3000)              and interest above 8%.
C                    The allottees pay the full cost of the
(3001-5000)              development and are charged 10% interest.
The income eligibility ceiling for NHA units falls in the eighth decile of
the estimated income distribution for Bangkok; households up to the middle of
the sixth decile are eligible for the heavily subsidized A and B units (Table
VI-6, p. 71).



-8-
A core housing scheme at Rangsit on Bangkok's northern outskirts illustrates
the pricing system for Group A units. The units which cost about B 45,500
each to construct (exclusive of land which NRA inherited at its inception)
are being sold for B 210 a month over 25 years. Assuming an interest rate of
12% and average estate management expenses of B 100 per month over time, the
present worth of the payments for these units is only B 10,450 or about 23%
of the development cost without land. NHA tenants can realize the subsidies
in cash by illegally subletting units; in 1973 an estimated 30% of NRA units
were occupied by ineligible families who pay substantial key money and sev-
eral times the official monthly rent to live in the units.
1.24      As a result of these subsidies and arrears, NHA had an accumu-
lated deficit of US$5.5 million in 1977. Under current pricing policies this
deficit, which must be financed from capital resources, will increase sharply
as more units are completed and sold. This implies that the revolving fund
intended to finance future projects is being used to cover deficits attributa-
ble primarily to subsidies. Arrears have been a persistent problem. In
mid-1977, 26% of the accounts receivable during the forthcoming fiscal year
represented overdue payments for rental and hire-purchase properties. However,
since collection has improved recently, arrearage for rental properties has
been reduced from an average of 3 to about 1.5 months per unit.
1.25      Dissatisfaction within the Government with NHA's heavy subsidies has
recently led to reviews which are likely to result in changes in NHA's pricing
policies and design standards. Government approval of seven NRA project
proposals was delayed during L977, pending review of NHA's policies. In
January 1978, the NRA Board approved new policies which would substantially
reduce subsidies and emphasize sites and services schemes. Under the new
policies, which are subject to Government review, the lowest income group
would pay approximately 60% of the capital cost of typical units. The sites
and services component of the proposed project is intended to support these
policy changes by demonstrating the feasibility of self-financing schemes with
standards affordable by low-income families.
1.26      Another important policy change was the Cabinet's approval in
early 1977 of a Bangkok Slum UJpgrading Program to be implemented by NHA; the
new Government has reaffirmed its commitment to this program. On the basis of
a survey of 108 slums, 38 communities housing about 12,000 families were
identified for permanent improvement. The slum improvement component of the
proposed project would support the upgrading of five slums during the pro-
gram's first two-year implementation period. Slums located primarily on
Government land were selected for the first phase because of constraints on
NHA's power to deal with private landowners. A committee responsible to the
Ministry of the Interior is currently reviewing Thai legislation affecting
slum improvement and will propose changes to enhance NRA's power to upgrade
privately owned slums in subsequent phases.

II. PROJECT COMPONENTS, COSTS AND FINANCING
A. The Project
2.01      The proposed project, the Bank's first urban project in Thailand,
is viewed as a pilot project which would be carefully monitored and evaluated.
It is designed to address the housing and employment needs of the low-income
families in Metropolitan Bangkok without capital subsidies. Present NHA pub-
lic housing projects are able to reach low-income families only through large
subsidies (about 75%), thereby seriously limiting the feasible scope of the
program.  NiA is, however, in the process of reviewing its housing program and
policies, including the subsidy issue. The proposed project is intended to
demonstrate the technical and financial feasibility of new approaches to the
shelter problem of Bangkok's urban poor and to support NRA's ongoing reevalua-
tion of its programs and policies. Specifically, the role of the pilot
project would be to: (a) develop appropriate design standards affordable by
the poor for sites and services residential developments; (b) support imple-
mentation of the initial phase of the Bangkok Slum Upgrading Program; and
(c) provide technical assistance to support the reevaluation of policies
occurring within NHA. Several years of discussions with NRA have indicated
its unwillingness to undertake a larger project with more extensive policy
and programmatic changes until the viability of sites and services and
slum improvement has been demonstrated in Bangkok. The proposed project is
therefore intended to establish a working relationship between the Bank and
NHA which may eventuate in larger projects bearing more policy significance.
2.02      The proposed project would consist of:
(a)  housing sites and services at Tung Song Hong for about
3,000 housing units, including (i) land and infrastructure,
(ii) core houses with sanitary facilities, (iii) materials
loans for house completion through self-help, (iv) com-
munity facilities, (v) commercial and small-scale
industrial areas and (vi) loans to small-scale businesses;

Tung Song Hong Sites and Services
2.03      The sites and services component will be located at the Tung Song
Hong site (Map 12388). The site has been carefully selected from a limited
number of choices available. The site is already owned by the NRA and is
well located for low-income residential development from the point of view
of size, cost, employment, and transport and service linkages. It was pur-
chased in 1966 by the Government Housing Bank and transferred to NRA at
its inception in 1973. The site, covering an area of 268 rais (43 ha), is
located some 17 km north of the city center, about 2 km south of the Bangkok
International Airport and about 0.2 km from the Rangsit Highway. It is
bounded by private real estate developments in the north, south and west.
The east side facing the highway is intercepted by a strip of privately
owned land, a klong operated by the Royal Irrigation Department and a railway
track, property of the State Railway of Thailand. Like most of Bangkok, the
ground level of the site is low, approximately 2 m above mean sea level,
thus requiring land filling and/or other flood protective measures. It is
presently used as rice fields.
2.04      The Tung Song Hong site was not developed earlier because it lacked
direct access to the nearby Rangsit Highway. The access problem has now been
resolved as a result of several actions. First, NHA has purchased a 0.3 ha
strip of land on the east side of the site on which an access road can be
built to Rangsit Highway. Second, NHA has obtained permission from the State
Railway of Thailand to build a level crossing over the existing railway track.
Third, NHA has obtained permission from the Royal Irrigation Department to
construct a bridge across the klong, which lies between the railway track and
the highway. Lastly, NHA has obtained permission from the Highway Department
for a temporary access from Rangsit Highway to the site and a pedestrian
bridge over the highway. The Highway Department would not grant permanent
access to the highway because it plans to construct a segregated crossing
about one km south of the site to reduce traffic congestion in the area. Even
though the access granted to the Tung Song Hong site is temporary, it is
unlikely that this would be closed in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless,
NRA has agreed to make arrangements for permanent vehicular access to the
site. Two possible alternatives are: (i) to negotiate a right-of-way on the
existing private access road serving residential areas south of the site or
(ii) to have BMA plan and construct a feeder road toward the eastern end of
the site which would link to the Rangsit Highway through the Jam Watanna Road
of the proposed segregated crossing. NHA is currently reviewing the two
alternatives. During negotiations, it was agreed that the Government would
furnish the Bank, by June 1979, a plan of action, including timetable, for
provision of permanent access to Tung Song Hong.
2.05      The guarded level crossing over the railway tracks and the bridge
over the klong will provide vehicular and pedestrian access to the site. The
pedestrian bridge to be constructed over the Rangsit Highway and bus stops to
be installed on either side of the highway will permit safe and convenient
access for both pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Frequent bus and minibus
service is currently available from Rangsit Highway to various industrial and
commercial areas in the vicinity. The travelling time to most of these places



- 11 -
of employment is estimated at 20-60 minutes, which is reasonable in terms of
Bangkok traffic. The site is not connected to the city water supply system;
therefore, it will have its own independent water source consisting of two
tube wells. An aerated lagoon system will be provided to treat the wastewater
generated within the project area. Drainage of the site will be possible by
discharging into Klong Bang Pool, located along the north boundary. Overhead
power lines (3,285 KVA) of the Metropolitan Electricity Authority traverse
the site in the east, and telephone lines run along the Rangsit Highway so
these connections will pose no problem.
2.06      There will be approximately 3,000 residential plots at Tung Song
Hong. The proposed site layout is shown on Map 13129. Planning criteria
and design standards are described in Chapter IV. The land use plan and the
site layout have been designed to minimize infrastructure cost while providing
significant improvement to the facilities and urban services usually acces-
sible to the target group. The layout creates three zones with different
levels of accessibility and therefore of retail potential. In addition to
location, the residents can select from three plot sizes (70, 80 and 100 sq
m). Each plot will have access by road or footpath and will have all major
utility connections: water, drainage, sewerage and electricity.
2.07      Ninety-six percent of the plots will be provided with a core
house to enable immediate settlement. The remaining 4% of the plots (121)
will have sanitary cores or no on-plot construction to test the popularity
of cheaper open plots among the target group. Three types of core units
have been designed, each constructed to a different level of completion
(Chart 18083) to meet the demands of different income groups. The cheapest
option (Type Al) provides a toilet and a room and can be extended to a
house consisting of three rooms, a kitchen and a toilet. The project will
provide building materials loans for expansion of houses on a self-help basis.
Initial building costs and materials requirements for self-help expansion
are also indicated in Chart 18083.
2.08      The project will provide for the construction of two primary schools
with a total of 42 classrooms and five day care centers with a total of 40
classrooms at Tung Song Hong. The primary schools will absorb the 3,000
students projected in the vicinity and will work on a double-shift basis.
Playgrounds and a football field will also be provided. A second-class health
center will be constructed on the site to supplement the existing first-class
center and hospital in the area. The center will provide services including
primary health care, an immunization program, health education, maternal and
child health care and family planning services. A community administration
and services complex to be provided on the site will house an assembly hall,
public library, post office, the health center and office space. In addition,
24 neighborhood playgrounds and a central park will also be provided. Assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that the concerned ministries and
agencies will adequately staff and equip the proposed facilities.

King Petch Slum Improvement
2.09      King Petch, the first slum to be improved, is located in the
city center and covers an area of 12.7 ha. It is an old established community
which was at the fringe of the city after World War II and has gradually
changed from a rural village to an urbanized low-income community. Nearly 67%
of the land in King Petch belongs to the Government; the remainder is
privately owned. It contains a population of over 10,000 inhabitants whose
average monthly household income is around B 2,800. There are nearly 1,500
dwelling units in King Petch, mostly of wood but with a few concrete and brick
buildings; on the average, these houses are 25 years old. Although King Petch
may appear to be crowded, it is a medium-density area by Bangkok standards.
The majority of the residents have access to water and electricity, although
36% of the houses do not have direct piped water, and 2.4% do not have metered
electricity. It is an area of generally mixed residential, commercial and
light industrial use.
2.10      There were three major reasons for selection of King Petch as the
initial pilot project for slum improvement. First, more information on land
tenure and maps of the area were available than in other areas. Second, it is
a medium-sized central city community close to employment locations. Third,
it was considered that the community's integration and level of organization
would reinforce an improvement program.
2.11      The major physical problems faced by the community are:
(a) lack of adequate drainage;
(b) inadequacy of the internal circulation network
presently composed of narrow, unstable wooden
walkways;
(c) intermittent water supply service;
(d) lack of refuse disposal system; and
(e) inadequate fire protection.
No schools or clinics are located within King Petch, but its inhabitants have
access to several such facilities located within walking distance.
2.12      The following improvements are envisaged for the King Petch area
through the project:
(a) provision of secure land tenure to existing residents
through long-term leases;
(b) infrastructure improvements including construction of
new wooden and concrete walkways, creation of an
adequate drainage system, upgrading of the water network



- 14 -
permitting substantial increase in water quality and
consumption, creation of a garbage disposal system
managed by the community and linked to the BMA refuse
collection system, and improvement of the fire protection
equipment;
(c) provision for two primary schools/multi-purpose buildings
to be constructed by NRA;
(d) small-scale business loans to local enterprises for
expansion of existing or creation of new businesses;
the average loan will be around B 2,500 (US$125); and
(e) social support programs to include adult training and
community organization and participation program to
reinforce community self-help programs.
The details of the land tenure arrangements and physical improvements are
described in Chapters III and IV, respectively.
2.13      Two sites on Government land have been selected for community
facilities at King Petch. It is envisaged that two schools/multi-purpose
buildings will be constructed by NHA. Construction would require the re-
location of approximately 12 families within the slum area. Assurances
were obtained during negotiations that the relevant agencies will staff
and operate the facilities.
Improvement of Additional Slums
2.14      Four additional slums, Wat Pradittaran, Soi Sripum, Wat Yai Srisuphan
and Wat Sroi Tang (Map 12388), containing in total about 800 dwelling units,
will also be improved. These slums were selected during the appraisal mission
and have been included in the project to expand the slum improvement component
and to support NHA's three-year Slum Upgrading Program for Bangkok. Three main
considerations taken into account in selecting these slums were:
(a)  designation for permanent improvement in NHA's Slum
Upgrading Program;
(b) location wholly or substantially on Government land in
order to minimize land tenure and cost recovery problems;
and
(c)  suitability for improvement in terms of its size,
location and physical condition.
2.15      The four slums will be improved using standards comparable to those
planned for King Petch. Improvement in these slums would be undertaken in



- 15 -
the second phase of project implementation, by which time it would be possible
to assess the success or problems associated with the King Petch scheme.
NHA has submitted to the Bank preliminary engineering and revised cost esti-
mates for two of these slums. Final plans for the remaining slums will be
prepared during project implementation.
Small Business Support Program
2.16      The small-scale business program at Tung Song Hong is designed to
provide employment opportunities for about 1,500 residents, primarily women
wishing to work within the community who would be unable to find employment
otherwise. The essential elements of the program are that the NHA will
develop and promote a small industry complex on its site and will act as the
broker between potential entrepreneurs and the institutions that provide a
broad range of technical assistance services and financing. These agencies
include the Department of Industrial Promotion (DIP), the National Institute
of Skill Development (NISD), and the Krung Thai Bank (KTB).
2.17      In the slums to be improved, existing businesses will be eligible
for support. In addition to technical assistance and training, many of the
businesses could use small loans (B 1,500-10,000) for machinery or raw
materials. NHA will again act as the broker for the small entrepreneurs in
these communities. Community officers will assess potential borrowers and
assist applicants whose proposals appear feasible in completing KTB's forms
and processing requirements. The details of the small business support
program are described in Chapter IV.
Technical Assistance
2.18      Three general areas in which NHA would be strengthened through
technical assistance are organization and financial management, project
design and estate management. The project will provide three types of
assistance to address these needs: (i) professional services, (ii) regional
field trips and work-study programs in other agencies and (iii) funds for
advanced studies. The technical assistance category also provides for
monitoring and evaluation of the subprojects. A small amount of money
(US$20,000) has been designated for equipment, primarily for use in the design
of slum upgrading projects. A detailed description of the technical as-
sistance is given in Chapter V.
B. Cost Estimates
2.19      The total project cost is estimated at B 344.0 million (US$17.2
million) of which 29% is foreign exchange cost. The taxes and duties element
of the total project cost is estimated at US$0.50 million. The summary of
project cost estimates is given in Table II-1; detailed cost estimates for
project components are shown in Tables IV-l through IV-3 and for technical



- 16-
assistance in Table V-2.  All cost estimates are expresse&in September 1977
prices. Infrastructure, core housing and community/commercial facilities
costs for the Tung Song Hong site are based on preliminary engineering designs
completed by NHA. The estimates for the King Petch area and two of the other
slums are also based on preliminary engineering completed by NHA. The esti-
mates for the remaining two slums have been projected from the King Petch
costs.
2.20      Physical contingencies of 15% for civil works at Tung Song Hong have
been provided. A higher provision is made for physical contingencies for the
slum improvement component, 20% for King Petch and 30% for other slums.
Price escalation on all works, goods and services is based on an estimated
rate of inflation for construction industry in Thailand of 9% per year during
1978-79 and 8% during 1980, which is in accordance with Bank estimate. This
amounts to an overall price contingency of about 15%.

C. Financing
2.21      The proposed Bank loan of US$8.6 million would finance 50% of total
project cost. The loan would cover 100% of foreign exchange costs as well as
30% of local costs. The Bank loan will be made to the Royal Thai Government
(RTG) which will pass about 77% of the Bank loan (US$6.6 million) on to NHA as
a loan at 7.5% interest and 20 years with five years grace. About 23% of the
loan (US$2.0 million) will be passed on to NHA as a grant for costs which NHA
cannot recover (paras 6.08 and 6.09). The Government will make an additional
US$1.2 million equivalent available to NHA directly as grants. NHA would
provide about US$6.3 million equivalent from its normal sources of funds,
excluding land acquisition costs already incurred (US$0.8 million equivalent).
Krung Thai Bank would provide about US$0.3 million equivalent for the small
business component of the project.

2.23      Retroactive financing amounting to about US$300,000 is recommended
for expenditures incurred from March 1978 for land filling and completion
of the access road at Tung Song Hong. These initial activities are necessary
to allow for preliminary works and for lead time on the construction season
(November to July), thus expediting project implementation.
III. EXECUTING AGENCIES AND PROJECT MANAGEMENT
A. National Housing Authority (NHA)
Organization, Staffing and Finance
3.01      The principal executing agency for the project would be NRA. 1/
NRA's organizational structure and staffing levels are shown in Chart
III-1. Its chief executive officer is a Governor responsible to a Cabinet-
appointed Board of Directors. The Research and Construction Department is
the largest department, accounting for 37% of the 1,328 permanent staff in
mid-1977. NRA has been able to attract young staff with strong formal
qualifications, but relatively few of its technicians have had much practical
experience. Rapid expansion of NRA's staff and growth in the number of
projects being executed simultaneously have strained the organization's
capability to manage and monitor project implementation. One consequence has
been substantial delays and frequent cost overruns. Financial management has
also been weak, emphasizing bookkeeping rather than systematic use of finan-
cial data for management planning and project monitoring. The technical
assistance included in the project provides for consultancy services to
improve NHA's organizational and financial management (para. 5.06).
3.02      During its 1976 fiscal year, NHA had capital expenditures of about
US$14.7 million, administrative expenses of about US$3.9 million and revenues
of US$2.1 million. Its balance sheet at May 31, 1977 (Table III-1) showed
assets of US$163.8 million. Due to acceleration of its construction program,
almost half of the assets (US$77.9 million) were accounted for by completed
units and projects being implemented. Current assets include arrears amount-
ing to 26% of accounts receivable during 1977-78. Among NRA's liabilities,
the B 1,000 million bond issue in 1976 appears as the most significant borrow-
ing on the private market. The capital items show deductions totaling US$7.3
million due to nonrecoverable expenditures, downward revaluation of assets and
a cumulative deficit of US$5.5 million attributable primarily to subsidies.
Current liabilities substantially exceed current assets, although NHA's
liquidity position should improve as completed units are sold.
1/   The formation, purposes and performance of the NHA are described in
paras 1.20-1.26 of the Sector Background.

3.03      NHA's current financial arrangements and subsidy policies mean that
its program requires substantial ongoing financial support from the Government
through operating grants, capital contributions or servicing of its debts.
The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate the types of schemes which
can supply residential services to large numbers of poor families without
subsidies. Although the project will not have a substantial impact on NHA's
overall financial position in the short term, it will contribute to the
formulation of policies and programs which will eventually enable the NHA to
become financially self-sufficient. During negotiations, RTG agreed to
exchange views with the Bank regarding any changes being considered in NHA's
financial arrangements, criteria for cost recovery and construction program.
Project Organization and Management
3.04      Each major project component (i.e., Tung Song Hong, King Petch,
other slums) will be implemented by project teams drawn from NHA's various
divisions under the overall direction of a Project Manager, whose appointment
will be subject to Bank confirmation. The Project Manager will be supported
by a deputy and an accountant. As agreed during appraisal of the project,
NHA has nominated a Project Manager and appointed a Deputy Manager, architect,
engineer and financial analyst as permanent staff members for the project.
Charts 17955 and 17956 indicate the NHA divisions which will contribute staff
to the project teams as well as the responsibilities of other agencies for
project execution. Regarding the financial management of the project, agree-
ment was obtained during negotiations that NHA will (i) maintain separate
accounting records and a separate bank account for all project revenues and
expenditures, (ii) ensure adequate and timely working capital is provided to
finance the project, and (iii) have the project accounts audited annually by
an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank.
3.05      In addition to the appointment of project management staff and
designation of project teams, NHA will strengthen its staffing in two other
areas for the project. The Slum Upgrading Office was established in early
1977 to implement the Bangkok Slum Upgrading Program approved by the Cabinet.
In mid-1977, the office had 10 professional and 20 support staff, sufficient
for one integrated slum upgrading team. To plan and execute the five up-
grading subprojects, the office will be expanded to create a second team of
eight professionals plus support staff. The Commercial Section in the Rent
and Hire-Purchase Division will also need to be strengthened to implement the
project's small-business component. The section was established in 1976 and
had three staff members in mid-1977. At least three more economists or
financial analysts will be added to the section and assigned full-time to
the Tung Song Hong subproject.. NHA agreed during negotiations that the Slum
Upgrading Office and the Commercial Section will be adequately staffed to
implement the project.
Tung Song Hong Sites and Services
3.06      Site Development.  The design and construction of the Tung Song Hong
project will be the responsibility of staff from the Research and Construction
Department. NRA has a substantial technical staff, and both the detailed
engineering and supervision of construction will be handled by in-house staff



- 22 -
rather than consultants. The tendering procedures to be employed in the
project are described in para 5.02.
3.07      Allocations and Terms of Purchase.  Allottees for Tung Song Hong
will be selected from NHA's existing waiting list. To be eligible for
NHA housing, applicants must be Thai citizens, have been registered residents
of Bangkok for at least six months, not own land or a house in Bangkok and
meet the particular scheme's income criteria. Allottees for Tung Song Hong
will be distributed among NRA household-income categories as follows:
Group        Monthly Income Range (B)         Percent
A                1,000 - 1,500                  22
B                1,501 - 3,000                 69
C                3,001 - 5,000                   9
3.08      Eligible households on the NHA waiting list are offered places in
new schemes in order of application. Selected applicants may decline to
participate in specific schemes but are placed at the end of the waiting list
if they refuse three offers. In mid-1977, NHA's Bangkok waiting list had
80,000 applicants, approximately 60,000 of whom had applied during the pre-
vious year a result of publicity about NHA. If a household accepts an
offer to participate in a scheme, the information about its eligibility is
reverified. Plots in Tung Song Hong will be allocated approximately one year
before the scheme is ready for occupation. Allottees will be required to pay
a 10% down payment at the time of signing the hire-purchase agreement or in
installments during the following year.
3.09      The hire-purchase agreements will be for 20 years at 12% in-
terest. In order to discourage the speculative sale of plots, purchasers will
be required to occupy their plots within one year from the time they are
ready, and sales will be restricted to NHA at the original purchase price
during that year. Thereafter, the plots can be sold on the open market,
but NHA must verify that the prospective purchasers meet the project's
eligibility criteria. Subletting of the entire unit will be prohibited during
the first five years. Purchasers will be given freehold titles to their plots
after they have finished buying them.
3.10      Materials Loans.  NHA officials expressed strong fears that if
materials loans were made in cash, they would be diverted to other purposes.
However, they also recognized that borrowers might be able to achieve con-
siderable savings by using second-hand building materials such as used lumber
or galvanized iron sheets. G:iven the experimental nature of the project, it
was therefore agreed to offer loans in both cash and materials during an
experimental period of 6 to 12 months. The use of the loans will be monitored
closely and at the end of the period, a decision will be made to retain a mixed
system or to shift to one medium or the other.



- 23 -
3.11      Loans--in both cash and materials will be disbursed from an office on
the site. The prices assigned to materials will include full procurement and
management costs as well as the purchase prices. Initial cash loans will be
limited to half of the amount required for the materials for the next phase of
the borrower's unit. NHA technicians will verify that materials worth the
amount of this tranche have been used in construction on the lot before
authorizing the next tranche. Supplementary agreements with the same terms
(12%, 20 years) as for plot sales will be used for the materials loans. As
described in para 4.26, the ceiling on the amount of loan for which an
applicant will be eligible will depend on his repayment ability.
3.12      On-Site Administration.  NHA will operate an office at Tung Song
Hong to perform the following functions: collection of plot purchase and
materials loan repayments, disbursement of materials loans, management
of commercial and industrial space, maintenance and security, enforcement
of building regulations and support for self-help house construction. In
accordance with the agreement reached during the field appraisal of the
project, NHA submitted a satisfactory staffing plan and budget for the Tung
Song Hong site office to the Bank in October 1977.
3.13      The on-site NHA staff at Tung Song Hong will include five building
technicians to support house completion and extension by residents. These
technicians will be graduates of a three-year training program in construction
offered by the post-secondary vocational schools. They will be responsible
for demonstrating building techniques for project residents, monitoring the
use of materials loans taken in cash and enforcing building regulations. In
addition to demonstrations by the technicians, NRA will prepare and distribute
brochures illustrating incremental core housing plans using different build-
ing materials. Model units will also be built to demonstrate various core
expansion options. The only building regulations for the scheme will be
that (a) party walls and roofs must be of nonflammable materials, (b) plot
coverage will be limited to 75% and (c) no permanent structure will be
built within a stipulated distance on either side of the water and sewer
lines, which in most cases would be installed along the back boundary of
the plots.
3.14      Small-Industries Promotion.  The Commercial Section of the Rent
and Hire-Purchase Division will be responsible for marketing the commercial
and small-industries space at Tung Song Hong. Special attention will be
devoted to assisting small, labor-intensive, nonnoxious industries to locate
on the site. Serviced land and industrial sheds, with a flexible design which
can be adopted to the users' needs, will be sold on a hire-purchase basis.
Businesses needing loans for equipment or working capital will be referred to
KTB, which will make loans to small business from its own funds. The terms
and conditions for these loans are described in paras 4.41-4.45.
Management of Slum Improvement
3.15      Each slum improvement subproject will be planned and implemented
by a team of NRA staff from the Slum Upgrading Office. These teams will



- 24 -
consist of approximately 8-10 professionals, including an engineer, architect,
economist, lawyer and several sociologists/community workers. Following
procedures employed in planning the King Petch subproject, the teams will
survey residents' socio-economic characteristics and prepare maps showing
physical conditions and tenure patterns in each of the other slums to be
improved. On the basis of these studies and consultations with community
leaders, the teams will then prepare plans for infrastructure improvements,
regularization of tenure and cost recovery, and socio-economic programs
for each community.
3.16      The NHA teams will liaise closely with community advisory committees
comprised of local leaders drawn from existing community organizations or
identified through interviews in the communities. For example, in predomina-
tely Muslim King Petch the NHA team has worked closely with the mosque com-
mittees in two sections of ithe community and an ad-hoc committee in the third.
The community advisory committees will play particularly important roles in
helping to define the project components in each community, explaining the
project to residents, reviewing designs for infrastructure improvements,
insuring community cooperatiLon during construction and helping to organize
implementation of the tenure and socio-economic programs. During negotiations,
NHA agreed to continue to elicit the support of slum residents during planning
and implementation stages.
3.17      Physical Improvements.  The community advisory committees will be
given an opportunity to review preliminary designs for infrastructure improve-
ments. The engineers on the project team responsible for the designs will
also supervise construction by contractors. They will work closely with the
advisory committees to secure community cooperation during construction,
which is likely to disrupt normal circulation patterns in dense settlements
with narrow passageways. RTG and NHA assured that the families which are to
be relocated because of physical works will be compensated for demolished
structures and offered alternative accommodation at Tung Song Hong or another
NHA estate.  Improvements have been planned to minimize relocation.
3.18      Land Tenure.  Sixty-seven percent of the land in King Petch and
almost all of the land in the other four slums to be upgraded is owned by the
Treasury's Estate Department.  These lands are currently under short-term
leases, normally for one year.  Responsibility for these lands will be trans-
ferred to NHA, which will issue 20-year leases to the tenants and increase the
rents to amortize the recoverable costs of improvement (paras 6.09-6.12).
Leases for lands held by absentee landlords will be transferred to the current
tenants. NHA has recently signed a long-term lease agreement with the Treasury
Department, the principal landowner at each site, allowing NHA to sublease, in
turn, this land to slum resicdents.
3.19      In King Petch, 71% of the dwellings on privately owned land are
occupied by tenants, most of whom have only annual agreements or no formal
tenure at all. NHA has no authority to force landlords to enter longer-
term agreements with their tenants. However, the tenure issue has been



- 25 -
discussed in the community, and many of the landlords have indicated willing-
ness to formalize tenure arrangements or to extend their term. The lawyer
on the NRA project team will assist King Petch residents on private land in
revising their tenure arrangements. The existing tenure situation in King
Petch and the modifications to be introduced as part of the project are
summarized in the following diagram:

3.20      Socio-Economic Programs.  In order to improve the employment
opportunities and earnings of slum residents, programs to provide job train-
ing, credit and technical assistance to small businesses will be run in the
slums to be improved. The National Institute of Skill Development (NISD) will
prepare a mobile course in a skill area (e.g., small motor operation and
maintenance) identified jointly with NHA. In other mobile courses run
by NISD, two or three instructors have offered 30 to 60 hours of training.
Community workers on NHA teams will also help slum residents secure places in
vocational training courses outside the community offered by NISD and the
various divisions of the Department of Industrial Promotion (DIP).  The NISD
and other programs will be financed out of the agencies' normal operating
budgets.
3.21      Loans to small businesses in the slums will be made by KTB.
NHA community workers will identify and screen existing slum businesses which
could use small loans to expand their operations. Prospective borrowers will
be referred to KTB, which will assess their proposals and make the loans. The
terms and conditions for these loans are described in paras 4.36-4.47.
3.22      Family planning serv:ices will be provided in the slums by staff
from BMA health centers and the Family Planning Association of Thailand (FPAT).
The BMA's public health services are supported by the Family Health Division
of the Ministry of Public Health which provides in-service family planning
training for paramedical staff, birth control supplies and educational materials,
and technical support and supervision. FPAT will supplement the work of health
center staff by conducting fami'ly planning campaigns and population awareness
activities in project areas. They will work closely with BMA staff, NHA
community workers and the commttnity advisory commitees. The family planning
services will be finaced out of the normal operating budgets of BMA and FPAT.
B. Other Agencies
Small Business Loans
3.23      Small business loans in both Tung Song Hong and the slums to be
improved will be made by Krung Thai Bank (KTB) 1/ which has adequate funds
from its own resources to provide loans to small businesses in project areas.
Therefore, although $30,000 has been designated for small business loans in
the project cost estimates, no disbursement from the Bank loan for the project
will be necessary for this component.
1/   The Small Industries Finance Office (SIFO), an agency of the DIP which
combines its own funds (25%) with KTB funds (75%) in a special lending
program, was considered and later rejected for this component because its
interest rate is limited to 9.5% and its management and staffing have
been weak. A small industries project likely to entail substantial
reorganization of SIFO is currently being prepared for possible Bank
financing.



- 27 -
3.24      KTB is a commercial bank wholly owned by the Ministry of Finance,
the Under-Secretary of which serves as its Chairman. It was established
in 1966 by consolidating two Government banks, the Bank of Agriculture and
the Provincial Bank. Its main functions are to provide commercial banking
facilities for the Government as well as the public, to perform financial
functions which the Government cannot undertake directly and to extend the
banking system to all parts of the country. In pursuit of the last objective,
KTB has 143 branches, all but 20 outside Bangkok. Assets of B 23,843.3 mil-
lion (as of July 1, 1977) make it the second largest commercial bank in
Thailand. Its major asset categories are loans (40%), discounted bills (18%),
and Government or Government-guaranteed securities (28%). In mid-1977, it held
deposits of B 19.7 million. KTB made a net profit of B 107.7 million in its
1976-77 fiscal year.
3.25      For the project's small business lending component, NHA staff
members will be responsible for making the initial contacts with potential
borrowers at both Tung Song Hong and the slums to be improved. They will
screen prospective borrowers, help them prepare proposals and applications
and direct them to KTB. KIB will be responsible for assessing the applica-
tions, approving and disbursing the loans and collecting loans repayments.
The loans will be made at the prevailing rate for small industry and business
loans, anticipated to be 12-15% based on recent trends. The component is
described in detail in paras 4.41-4.47.
Responsibility for Operations and Maintenance
3.26      Responsibility for the operation and maintenance of infrastructure,
utilities and community facilities in the project will involve several other
agencies. The NHA site office at Tung Song Hong will operate the water
supply and sewerage systems and maintain the roads, drains and footpaths.
Responsibility for other infrastructure and community facilities constructed
as part of the project will be assumed by the normal operating agencies as
follows:

IV. DESIGN STANDARDS AND PROJECT SPECIFICATIONS
A. Sites and Services
4.01      Preliminary architectural and engineering designs were prepared
by NRA's Policy and Planning and Research and Construction Departments.
Detailed designs of individual components are being completed by these de-
partments, in conjunction with MWWA for the water supply component, MEA for
the electricity supply component and BMA for the community facilities. Regard-
ing the design of off-site infrastructural works, NHA will consult with the
Royal Irrigation Department (for klong crossing), the State of Railway of
Thailand (for level crossing) and the Highways Department (for access to the
Rangsit Highway). Project planning and design standards are briefly described
in the following paragraphs, with the detailed cost estimates shown in Table
IV-l.
Site Plan and Land Use
4.02      The site at Tung Song Hong covers a total area of about 268 rais
(43 ha).  It is relatively flat and thus the need for grubbing and levelling
the site is rather small. However, substantial land filling will be required
to prevent flooding during the rainy season. A small klong (canal) runs along
the northern boundary of the site which discharges into the Klong Prame
Prachakorn, running eastward of the site. The basic site plan is presented in
Map 13129.
4.03      Land utilization at the Tung Song Hong site will be as follows:
Type of Land Use                 Area (sq m)                % Total
Residential                             260,673                     60.8
Community and Educational
Facilities                             38,290                     8.9
Commercial and Small-Scale
Business Facilities                    20,195                     4.7
Circulation/Roads/Footpaths              65,490                     15.3
Open Space/Park                          34,402                      8.0
Treatment Plant                           9,750                      2.3
Total                                   428,800 (268 rais)         100.0



- 32 -
Open areas will consist of a central park and neighborhood playgrounds
planted with trees. Landscaping will also be provided for all roads,
footpaths and open areas around the community facilities and the commercial
center.
Circulation
4.04      The circulation network consists of a hierarchy of roads and
footpaths with the following design features:
(a) Main Road is designed for heavy traffic such as buses
and trucks. It will provide access to housing neigh-
borhoods, commercial and community facilities and
utility main lines and has a 12 m right-of-way with a
5 m wide asphaltic-paved carriageway constructed accord-
ing to the macadam type: 15 cm sand base, 15 cm crushed
rock and a 4 cm asphaltic concrete top. The road is
also provided with 2 m wide footpaths made of precast
concrete slab and 1 m wide (top) trapezoidal-shaped
concrete open gutters on either side of the carriageway;
(b) Secondary Roads are designed to lead off the main road
to provide access to housing neighborhoods and to areas
around the commercial center. The roads have a 6-8 m
right-of-way with a 3-3.6 m carriageway macadamized
with asphalt. The side drains are 0.3-0.5 m wide and
have a rectangular cross-sectional area;
(c) Main Pedestrian and Bicycle Paths are designed to carry
pedestrian and bicycle traffic as well as occasional
service and emergency vehicles. They have a 9 m right-
of-way with two 1.2 m wide pedestrian and bicycle
tracks, and 0.6 m wide concrete pavements to allow
occasional service and emergency vehicles. Road
drainage will be accomplished through 0.3 m wide side
gutters. The roads will permit later upgrading for
vehicular access to suit future requirements;
(d) Footpaths are designed to provide access to individual
plots for pedestrian/bicycle traffic. They are 3-4 m
wide and carry concrete pavements 1.5 m wide and 6 cm
thick, provided with drainage gutters on both sides.
Concrete pavement, rather than bitumen, is chosen due
to simplicity in construction and lower maintenance
costs.
Flood Control and Surface Drainage
4.05      In order to avoid flooding during the rainy season, the ground
level of the site will have to be raised through an average land filling of



- 33 -
0.8 m. Alternative drainage schemes such as embankment and pumping were
considered but not adopted because of the size and geometry of the site.
4.06      Micro-drainage for the site will be through open drains, provided
along the roads and footpaths (para 4.04), that will carry water through a
primary drainage grid to the adjacent klong. The design is based on a five-
year storm frequency while the runoff co-efficient is assumed to be 0.60
on the average. The design velocity in the drains is on the order of
0.7-1.0 m/sec.
Water Supply
4.07      The system is designed for a consumption of 150 lcd, which is about
the same as the current consumption level in low and middle-income neighbor-
hoods in Bangkok. Industrial demand is assumed to be 20,000 1/ha/day. In the
absence of any MWWA water main in the area, 1/ two tube wells about 100-150 m
deep will be sunk into the ground to pump water of acceptable water quality. 2/
Two elevated reservoirs will also be constructed to distribute water at an
adequate pressure (9 m residual pressure) to the community. The reservoirs
will each have a capacity of 30% of the average daily flow with the low-water
level set at 18 m above ground level. The peak flow factor will be 2.0 times
the average daily flow.
4.08      The primary and secondary water distribution grid will consist of
locally manufactured asbestos cement pipes (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 cm diameter)
with cast-iron fittings and flexible joints. The majority of the network will
represent 10 cm AC pipe lines. Fire hydrants capable of providing 950 I/min
will be located along the main road and the main pedestrian road at an approx-
imate spacing of 200 m.
4.09      Individual service connections, consisting of locally made 1/2"
diameter GI pipes, 3/ will be provided at all plots. Tertiary distribution
mains consisting of 1-1/2" and 2" GI pipes and 4" AC pipes will be installed
in the back of the plots to reduce pipe lengths for service connections
and achieve significant cost savings. Since no easement is provided in the
back of the plots, NHA would stipulate in the lease agreement the right
of access to the pipe line in case of repairs. NHA will further stipulate
1/   Following the prevailing practice, NRA will construct and maintain the
water supply system at Tung Song Hong until the MWWA system is extended
to the area. According to MWWA Water Supply Master Plan, distribution
mains in the vicinity of Tung Song Hong site will not be provided until
1985.
2/   Quality of water pumped from wells located in neighborhood developments
is known to meet drinking water standards of MWWA.
3/   Use of alternative pipe material (i.e., p.v.c) for the tertiary dis-
tribution system is being investigated by NHA.

minimum setback standards for constructing any permanent structure near the
pipeline. 1/ Provision of backyard easement was disfavored to prevent the
narrow areas from becoming garbage accumulation centers and to deter prowlers
in the oackyards.
4.10      In view of the high initial costs, metering will not be provided
at individual plots. Instead, a flat rate water charge will be included
in the monthly service charge (para 6.05). A small portion of the scheme
will be metered to compare consumption rate with the rest of the area.
Sewerage
4.11      No central sewage treatment system exists at present in Bangkok.
A comprehensive master plan for sewage collection, treatment and disposal
is yet to be implemented for the metropolitan area. 2/ The most common
treatment device consists of individual septic tanks and aqua privies,
with disposal of the effluent achieved through dispersion into the subsoil
or discharged to the road drains, which ultimately carry them to the klongs.
The soil is so imperious (mostly clayey) and the water table so high that
most of the sewage from the septic tanks and privies reach the open gutters
and canals, resulting in anaerobic bacterial action and putrefaction.
4.12      The few notable exceptions to the above situation include NHA
housing developments with individual on-site sewage treatment systems varying
from activated sludge units to oxidation ditches with lined bottoms. The
capital costs of these systems have been rather high. At the Tung Song
Hong site, a low-cost aerated lagoon system, comprising a total surface area
of approximately 1 ha, will be designed to treat the wastewater generated from
the project area. Treatment of the waste organics will be accomplished in a
series of 2-2.5 m deep ponds, primary and secondary type, based on their
function, and the effluent will be discharged by gravity into the
adjacent klong.
4.13      Design criteria for the sewerage system include a per-capita
contribution of 120 lcd representing 80% return of the water consumed,
an infiltration allowance of 2,500 1/ha/day and a peak flow factor of 2.
A pumping and a lift station will be provided to collect the wastewater
through a network of primary, secondary and tertiary pipes and convey it
to the treatment site. The secondary and primary network will consist
of 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 cm RCC pipes. A minimum velocity of 60 cm/sec
at peak flows will be used for sewer design. Manholes will be made of
1/   The same situation holds true for the sewer line.  Thus, in the absence
of any easement, most of the plots would either have a distribution
waterline or a sewerline inside their property line. NHA does not
anticipate any problem in enforcing the setback standards.
2/   Even though a sewerage master plan exists for the area, it needs to
be updated. The original master plan was outlined in the report titled
"Master Plan: Sewerage, Drainage and Flood Protection Systems for
Bangkok and Thonburi Areas" by Camp, Dresser and McKee, USA (1968).

concrete blocks for the shallower sections (up to 2 m depth) and precast
segments for the deeper sections.
4.14      Each plot will have individual sanitary units consisting of pour-
flush, water-seal type latrines. Service connections will be made with
10 cm AC pipes connected to 15 cm AC pipes along the property lines. Clean-
outs and rodding eyes will be provided in lieu of manholes at household
connections. Due to the burrowing activity of rodents, use of PVC pipes
is not recommended.
Solid Wastes Disposal
4.15      Approximately 50 cu m of solid wastes will be generated on the site
per day. Containerized storage will be sought from the outset. About 16
collection points will be established along the roads and the main pedestrian
walkways, each serving approximately 200 families. The containers located at
each collection point are designed for a total storage of 8 cu m representing
two days' collection. As in the case of other NRA development areas, BMA will
be responsible for regular removal of the wastes from these containers.
Electricity and Street Lighting
4.16      Overhead power lines (24 KVA) are currently available near the
site and will be used for site connections based on a design consumption
rate of 15 amps per household. Electricity network will consist of high-
tension lines, transformers and low-tension circuits. A uniform distribution
of loads in the low-tension circuits is adopted in order to use transformers
of the same capacity. High-tension poles will be spaced at 40 m apart and
low-tension poles at 20 m apart. Consumption will be measured by meters
installed by MEA, which will also be responsible for collecting the fee from
the residents. Based on a unit rate of B 0.75 per KWH, the electrical
charge per household will average about B 30 per month. For reasons of
public safety and convenience, street lighting will be installed by MEA
along main roads and walkways; the minimum luminous intensity on surface will
not be less than 0.6 ft. candle for the main roads and 0.4 ft. candle for
secondary road and walkways.
Plot Options and Core Types
4.17      A range of plot options according to size, location and cost,
together with the various core types available, will best promote social
heterogeneity and natural growth of the community. In all, three residential
plot sizes, 70, 80 and 100 sq m, that will permit different housing plans are
available as shown in the following table. In addition, the residential area
is divided into three different price zones reflecting their commercial
potential and degree of accessibility:
Zone a - High commercial potential. Refers to areas that
front on the main road and secondary roads.



- 36 -
Zone b - Good accessibility and commercial potential. Refers
to areas located along the secondary roads and the
main pedestrian paths.
Zone c - Lower accessibility. Refers to inner residential
areas served by footpaths.

basic sanitary core consisting of a pour-flush, water-seal type toilet connected
to a sewer line, and a water connection supplying two faucets--one over a
sink in the core and the other in a drained area outside the core. Three
types of core units have been designed as follows:
(a) Core Type A is a single-storey rowhouse with three
incremental stage options (Al, A2.1 and A2.2) and
is the cheapest core unit to be built on both Types
I and II plots. It consists of a sanitary unit (bath
and toilet) and multi-purpose space. The total covered
ranges from 20.52 to 37.80 sq m depending on the type.
Electrical wiring, water supply, sewer connections,
one toilet and three light bulbs will be installed.
The occupants will have to complete internal parti-
tions on their own.
(b) Core Type B represents a two-storey, rowhouse-type
design with a covered area of 60.48 sq m. This is



- 37 -
the most expensive type with the upper floor consist-
ing of two bedrooms, bath and toilet, and circulation-
storage space; the ground floor will accommodate
living-dining-kitchen areas. Electricity and lighting,
water supply and sewer connections, faucets and toilet
will be installed as necessary. The owner has to com-
plete the lower floor facade himself.
(c) Core Type Cl consists of a quadruplex kitchen-bath unit
and a semi-detached unit of bedroom and living area.
The total covered area is 23.04 sq m. This type design
will be completely built. Core type C will be an open-
type, consisting only of a Type Cl kitchen-bath unit
of 5.76 sq m.
Basic materials used in the core construction will be precast reinforced
concrete components for the floor and the party walls in all types except
Type C where the wall will be of prefabricated, lightweight (hard board)
panels. Roofing for all types will consist of asbestos-cement corrugated
sheets.

Educational Facilities
4.20       Based on a projected primary age population of about 3,000 children
in Tung Song Hong, two primary schools are needed on the site. Forty-two
classrooms to be utilized on a double-shift basis would be required to meet
the demand.  Thes> :-hools would provide 100% coverage for the projected
primary school-age population in accordance with city-wide standards requiring
compulsory attendance of this age group. The maximum number of pupils/class-
room is 35, th- size of a classroom is 81 sq m and the minimum land area
requirement per school of 5 raiLs has been met (total area for the two schools
is 13.21 rais).
4.21       F'tsic day care centers are to be constructed on the site to meet
NHA's es:   ;   of approximately 1,152 children in the age group 3-6.  The
coverage re-7ommended is 100%, requiring about 40 classrooms or 8 classrooms
for eahi if she 5 schools.  The size of a classrom is 81 sq m, and each center
will cover   land area of I raii.  The standards proposed by NHA are somewhat
higher than those existing in Bangkok.
Community Facilities
4.22       A community administration and services complex will be constructed
on a 1,800 sq m plot. The center will consist of a covered area of about
1,500 sq m, including a multi-purpose area, administrative office and assembly
hall. Also housed within the complex will be a second-class health center
to serve the proposed population of about 20,000. The center will operate as
an outpatient clinic and would consist of a waiting area, delivery room, dis-
pensary, examination room, injection and dressing room, and staff area. The
approximate floor space of the unit is 360 sq m. For recreational purposes,
24 neighborhood playgrounds and a central park will also be provided.
Commercial and Small-Industry Center
4.23       The structures for the industrial and commercial center at Tung Song
Hong will occupy 20,195 sq m. They will consist of five different functional
components: workshops for small-scale industry, retail shops, food market,
residences for business owners, and common utilities and facilities. The
workshop space of 5,670 sq m is intended to provide an approximate 4.16 sq m
of working space per person for the industrial labor force of 1,400 persons,
as projected from the National Statistics Office Labor Force Survey. The
design of the retail shop incorporates flexibility for accommodating possible
increases in demand of either retail space or workshop space by providing a
"department store" type of arrangement for the rental space. The total area
alloca ed is 4,900 sq m for about 72 co-owners. Seventy-two 2-storey units
will be provided above the stores to serve as housing flats for the entre-
preneurs. The total floor area of 60 sq m per unit will be provided, and the
store roof-deck will be accessible as a common courtyard. To serve the
projected 20,000 residents, a medium-sized food market of 1,140 sq m is planned



- 39 -
for the site. In addition, a paved 97-car parking lot will be provided, of
which two thirds will be reserved for the business owners. A 70 sq m garbage
collection bin and public toilet will be installed adjacent to the food
market.
Off-Site Infrastructure
4.24      An access road linking the site to the Rangsit Highway will be
included in the project. The access will include: a bridge across Klong
Prem Prachakorn, a railway crossing, and a pedestrian bridge over the high-
way. The bridge across the klong will be 8 m long, consisting of three 10 m
bays. The railway crossing will be at the existing level and will be guarded
by an NHA watchman at all times. The pedestrian bridge above the highway will
be of steel type, 30 m long and 2 m wide.
B. Materials Loans
4.25      Loans will be available to Tung Song Hong allottees to purchase
materials to extend their units (Chart 18101). It is anticipated that they
will construct the extensions on a self-help basis or hire artisans to do the
work. As indicated in para 3.10, during an initial experimental period
borrowers will be able to draw the loans in either cash or materials. Both
kinds of loans will be disbursed from an NHA site office. Households which
borrow cash rather than materials will initially be permitted to draw only
half of the loan for the next phase of their unit. Release of the second
tranche will be contingent on verification by an NHA building technician that
materials equivalent to the initial loan have been used for house extension.
At the end of the experimental period, NHA will decide whether to continue
lending in both cash and materials or in one medium only.
4.26      Materials loans will be made on the same terms as plot purchase
loans at 12% interest for 20 years. The following table indicates the pro-
jected uses and magnitudes of the materials loans and the borrowing rates used
to estimate the cost of the component. The projections are based on the
materials requirements for extensions according to standard NHA-type plans,
which will be available free of charge to Tung Song Hong residents. If
borrowers do not intend to follow the standard plans, they will be required to
submit alternative plans as part of their loan applications. The cost estimate
for the materials loans component assumes that half of the households with
open plots, sanitary cores or Al core houses will borrow for two extensions.
The amount a household can borrow will be limited so that its total monthly
payments for plot purchase, service charge, electricity payment and materials
loan repayment do not exceed 30% of its income.

C. Slum Improvement
4.27     Detailed engineering designs for the King Petch improvement scheme
are being prepared by NHA's Slum Upgrading Office in consultation with MWWA
(water supply) and MEA (electricity). NHA is collaborating with BMA and the
Ministry of Education concerning the physical designs of the community facil-
ities. Preliminary surveys, physical and socio-economics are being carried
out in the additional four slums to be upgraded, and the detailed facilities'
designs for these slums will be completed on the basis of experience gained
from implementation of the King Petch program. Detailed cost estimates for
King Petch and provisional cost estimates for the other slums are given in
Table IV-2 and Table IV-3, respectively.
Land Use
4.28     The King Petch slum comprises three areas, Ban Khrua, Wat Phrayayang
and Charoenphol. The land-use pattern at King Petch is shown in Map 12389.
The percentage of net residential area at King Petch is rather high (79%), and
the circulation area is relatively low (8%). Because demolition of existing
houses is to be minimized and King Petch is located close to the city center,
reduction in densities was not considered to be feasible. The waterways
include ditches and canals being used as garbage dumps, resulting in septic
bacterial action and malodors. Community facilities are essentially absent in
the King Petch area.



- 41 -
Access
4.29      The access network will consist of walkways that will generally
follow the existing circulation pattern in order to minimize the displacement
of families. Walkways will be designed so that no houses will be more than
100 m from a walkway. Two types of access have been planned: elevated
walkways at 2.0 m above MSL and grade walkways on existing ground. They are
further subdivided according to their widths of 0.9, 1.2 and 1.5 m. All
walkways will be of precast concrete, except the elevated narrow types
(0.9-1 m wide) which are wooden platforms supported on concrete posts. The
inexpensive precast system will serve to accelerate the construction phase.
Drainage
4.30      Existing drainage conditions are highly inadequate in King Petch,
and flooding is a serious problem during the rainy season. The road ditches
and canals have garbage blockages that impede the flow. In addition to
dredging and rehabilitating some existing primary and secondary drains, the
proposed scheme will also provide for secondary drainage for the walkways.
This will consist of trapezoidal sections built under the elevated walkways
and along the sides of ground-level walkways. About 8,000 m length of drain-
age works is included in the project. The residents will receive technical
assistance from NHA staff regarding linking of house drains to the drainage
system.
Water Supply
4.31      In most areas of King Petch, MWWA water supply already exists 1/
although the pressure (estimated to be 3 m head) is highly inadequate, and
leakage exists in several pipes. However, as a result of MWWA's ongoing
expansion program aimed at augmenting the water supply in the area (designated
as Zone 1 in MWWA Master Plan) through the provision of additional wells, the
water pressure is expected to increase substantially by the end of 1977. The
proposed water supply improvements in King Petch under this project consist
of about 4,530 m length of secondary and tertiary distribution lines with
diameters ranging from 2 to 15 cm. The 10 cm pipes will be of asbestos
cement-type, with the smaller pipes being of galvanized steel-type.
4.32      After completion, NHA will hand over the water supply facilities
to MWWA for operation and maintenance. About 200 new connections are antic-
ipated in the project area. Each new connection will be metered at the
owner's expense (B 1,000), and the consumption charged at the prevailing MWWA
rates. The typical water charge for a six-member household averages B 30-40
per month, based on per-capita water consumption rate of 150 I/day.
1/   More than 85% of King Petch residents have access to MWWA water supply.



- 42 -
Sewerage Disposal
4.33      As noted earlier (para 4.11), a central sewage treatment system
does not currently titL in thie Bangkok area. 1/  With a few minor exceptions,
King Petch employs the same sewage disposal system used throughout the metro-
politan area; narrily, septic tanks, aqua privies and cesspools. The seats are
usually elevated about 50 cm above the ground level to avert flooding problems
during the rainy season. The sludge from septic tanks is usually carried away
by hired laborers and dumped into the canals, although houses with vehicular
access may utilize the services of BMA or private pumping trucks for sludge
removal. Each tank is generally 0.7 m in diameter and 0.5 m deep, built with
3 concrete rings manufactured for this purpose.
4.34      Since as many as 852 of King Petch residents have access to indivi-
dual/multifamily-type toilets, the proposed scheme will focus mainly on
improvements in septic tank effluent pipes that will discharge into the
subsoil or into the road drains and canals. Technical assistance in septic
tank construction and operation will be given to residents by NHA.
Solid Waste Disposal
4.35      Garbage is not presently collected in King Petch due mainly to its
inaccessibility to garbage trucks as well as the absence of garbage containers.
As is common in other slums, garbage is generally thrown in the nearest canal,
ditch or open space. As a result, the site drainage problem in King Petch has
gradually worsened due to garbage accumulation. This situation is also
evidenced in the additional four slum areas to be upgraded. Because of the
vast magnitude of the problem, BMA's performance in removing the solid waste
blockages in the canals, mainly through dredging, has been rather dismal.  A
comprehensive master plan for solid wastes disposal has yet to be formulated
for the Bangkok area.
4.36      The proposed scheme provides for garbage disposal based on a gen-
eration rate of 20 1/family/day. Ten garbage collection points have been
identified along the main roads in the King Petch area, each serving the needs
of approximately 200 families. The garbage boxes, designed to provide a
three-day storage, will be emptied by BMA trucks at least twice a week. About
20 garbage carts will be provided to transport garbage from the streets to the
collection points. Operation of the carts will be done by community groups.
Street Lighting
4.37      Limited improvements in street lighting will be made under the
scheme. MEA will design and effect the necessary improvements, including
1/   A separate sewerage agency was established in August 1977 to focus on the
sewerage master plan details for the Bangkok Metropolitan Area. This
agency will collaborate wiLth the Department of Sanitation, which is
in charge of drainage, flood protection and garbage collection for the
area.



- 43 -
replacement of poles and rewiring if needed. Improvement costs will be
recovered by MEA through normal user charges. Private connections will be
individually metered and billed for consumption. The average electricity
charge for a typical family in King Petch would be about B 30 per month.
Fire Protection
4.38      Since vehicular access to the interior of King Petch does not exist,
an alternative fire protection scheme has been devised. This involves the use
of two mobile diesel pumps (55 HP each) with adequate hose lengths to use the
klong as a water source. In addition, fire extinguishers will be installed at
strategic locations in the area. Operation and maintenance of the fire pumps
will be undertaken by a two-member team appointed by the community group.
Fire drills will be routinely conducted as a part of the proposed scheme.
D. Small Business Promotion and Loans
4.39      Attractive technical assistance and financing packages are the
key features of the small business promotion component. The small business
component at Tung Song Hong is planned to meet the resident's needs for
shopping facilities and employment opportunities. Because these aspects often
overlap, the facilities have been designed with a measure of flexibility to
allow interchange of space for either commercial or manufacturing activities,
although a notional boundary has been established for each.
Commercial Facilities
4.40      The amount of commercial space provided at Tung Song Hong is
based on NHA's assessment of demand for such facilities and the existing and
potential supply in the area. The site is located in a relatively undeveloped
area with few facilities in the immediate vicinity. Consequently, a com-
mercial/industrial center (20,195 sq m net) is provided at the eastern end of
the site near the entrance. The center includes a medium-sized (1,140 sq m)
food market and 72 shop-houses provided on the basis of 60 sq m per 196
persons, a total of 4,900 sq m of commercial space. This fairly modest
provision (Thailand's general urban center ratio is 60 sq m per 100 persons)
is in addition to 800 sq m of hawkers' stall spaces at the western end of the
site and allows for the development of shop-houses along the main road and the
main pedestrian way throughout the site. The shops in the commercial center
will be accommodated on the first two floors of four-storey buildings, and the
remaining floors will be residential. These units will be sold on hire-
purchase terms to persons who wish to operate the commercial facilities. The
anticipated uses of shops range from grocery sale, dressmaking, charcoal shops
and automotive services to appliance distributors and pharmacies. Where
there is a manufacturing component to the enterprise (such as bakery or
dressmaking shop), it will be eligible for assistance under the small-scale
industry component.

Industrial Facilities
4.41      The small-scale industry program at Tung Song Hong is designed
to provide employment opportunities for as many as possible of the 1,500
residents (mostly women) expected to seek work within the community who
would otherwise be unemployed. An open-plan structure of 6169 sq m of
workshop space and 155 sq in of utility core will be provided which will be
subdivided and partitioned by NHA to meet the requirements of each enter-
prise. It is proposed thal: 2424 sq m of work space be sold as open plots.
The NHA will develop and promote the complex and act as the broker between
potential entrepreneurs and institutions which provide a broad range of
technical assistance and financing. These agencies include DIP, NISD and
KTB.
4.42      DIP is designed to provide a variety of services to industry.
Some of those relevant to this project include project promotion, manage-
ment training, marketing assistance, production planning and skills training
through the Productivity Center and the Industrial Services Institute. DIP
will assign about ten persons to this project and will also offer both exist-
ing and specially designed courses for potential entrepreneurs. NISD is a
major training institute for job entry and job upgrading. In order to use its
services, NHA will have to identify areas of training needed and the persons
to be trained and provide temporary facilities for workshops and administra-
tion. Unoccupied industrial space would be used for temporary workshops,
and unoccupied commercial space would serve as temporary administrative
centers. NISD requires six months notice to prepare and present its courses;
consequently, NRA will identify specific requirements early in the program.
4.43      Loans to small industries will be available from KTB.  It is anti-
cipated that project lending will be restricted to industries with fixed
assets not exceeding B 2 million and proposals requiring an investment of less
than B 60,000 per job (in order to maximize employment), and preference will
be given to enterprises which would employ the majority of their workers from
among Tung Song Hong residents. NHA will sell serviced land and basic in-
dustrial structures, which represent roughly half of the average fixed capital
of small industries, on hire-purchase terms. Loans will therefore be limited
to machinery and equipment which represent most (95%) of the remaining fixed
capital, except where permanent working capital is clearly identified and
requires financing. As a result, hire-purchase form of agreement may also be
used for the majority of lending. The terms of the loans will be up to
7 years at the prevailing market rate (expected to be 12-15%), with monthly
repayments. Generally, the investor would provide working capital, which
represents an average 20% of capital employed from his own resources. Most
investors are expected to have their own arrangements for financing; con-
sequently, the project lendiing component provides for only 25% of the esti-
mated loan requirements for the small industries space at Tung Song Hong.
4.44      In its promotional activities, NHA will identify the labor force,
its capabilities and interest, interview and screen potential investors,



- 45 -
assist in preparing the technical assistance and financing packages where
needed and coordinate with the various agencies which provide elements
of the packages, including assisting potential investors to obtain necessary
licenses from the Department of Industrial Works of the Ministry of Industry.
The criteria which have been established by NHA for selecting the industries
to be promoted, in addition to those mentioned for receiving loan financing,
include:
(a) classification by the Ministry of Industry (which issues
production licenses) as small, clean industries per-
mitted in residential areas;
(b) types of businesses which can market some of their pro-
ducts in the community and use the community's surplus
labor;
(c) labor-intensive production; and
(d) low requirement of labor technical skills.
4.45      Some of the types of businesses which could meet the above criteria
are:
(a)  industries producing iron grills for doors, windows
and other types of metal fabrications;
(b) industries producing food from flour, such as bread, cake,
biscuits and flour products;
(c) industries producing textile products, such as household
textile wares, bags and textile decorative products;
(d) industries producing apparrel, such as belts, handkerchiefs,
clothing, hats and shoes;
(e) industries producing furniture from wood and steel; and
(f) handicraft industries, jewelery, dolls and other export-
oriented products.
Business Promotion in Slum Areas
4.46      Small businesses already exist in the areas to be improved; therefore,
the need and the programs for these areas are for technical assistance to
improve performance and small loans (B 2,500-10,000) for machinery and pos-
sibly raw materials, which do not warrant detailed analysis and expensive
processing to determine collateral values for security. Surveys carried out
by NHA in King Petch have identified the types of loans, technical assistance,
job entry and job upgrading training desired by the community. NRA will
again act as the brokers for the small entrepreneurs in the improved com-
munities, coordinating the services of DIP and NISD for technical assistance



- 46 -
and training, and KTB for a special loan program. The maximum loan, under
the special loan program, is likely to be B 10,000 for up to 5 years at the
prevailing rate for such loans (expected to be 12-15%), repayable at monthly
intervals. To be eligible, the applicant must have lived in and operated
the business in the community for at least a year, and must be up-to-date
on payments on a lease (unexpired or renewable) which is good for the loan
period. Retention of lease will be linked to timely loan repayment as a
measure of security. Entrepreneurs wanting larger loans, or wishing to
establish a new business, would be eligible to apply for loans on the terms
for new industries if they have lived in the community for a year. Community
officers will assess and screen potential borrowers and assist applicants
whose proposals appear feasible in completing forms and requirements for
processing by KTB. Further investigation will be carried out by KTB staff
before granting loans. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that
KTB will provide adequate staff to undertake the small business loan program.
4.47      It was agreed during negotiations that the small business program
will be coordinated and monitored by a committee of all the agencies involved
and chaired by NHA.

V. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A. Implementation Schedule
5.01      The project would be implemented over a four-year period (1978-1981).
Work on the access road and land filling at Tung Song Hong will begin shortly
and is expected to be completed by September 1978. Construction of infra-
structure and core housing would start soon thereafter and would take about
two years. Construction at King Petch is also expected to begin within the
next few months and to be completed by the end of 1978. Work in the other
slums would begin early the following year. A project implementation schedule
is shown in Chart 18008.
B. Procurement
5.02      Civil works will be divided into the following five possible con-
tract packages: (i) land filling and access road at Tung Song Hong; (ii)
infrastructure and core housing at Tung Song Hong except the electricity
system; (iii) community and industrial facilities at Tung Song Hong; (iv)
infrastructure improvements at King Petch; and (v) infrastructure improvements
at four other slums. Construction of the project will be labor-intensive,
involving simple equipment and techniques which are well within the capabi-
lities of the local contractors. Contracts (ii) and (iii), estimated at about
US$6.5 million and US$3.5 million respectively, will be awarded on the basis
of international competitive bidding in accordance with the Bank guidelines.
Because of the nature of works and relatively small value involved (US$0.2-1.5
million), the remaining contracts will be awarded on the basis of local com-
petitive bidding, in accordance with NHA's standard procedures which are
satisfactory to the Bank. Materials provided by NHA for house completion
at Tung Song Hong will be purchased after local competitive bidding in accord-
ance with NHA's normal procedures, except that contracts of less than $5,000,
in an aggregate not exceeding $25,000, may be let after prudent shopping. The
contracts for land filling and access road at Tung Song Hong will be awarded
prior to signing of the Loan Agreement. Because of the scattered location of
slums and small size of improvement works involved, it may be difficult to
find suitable contractors to undertake these works. In that case, NHA would
undertake improvement works through force account, but only after it is
established that the works cannot be contracted. Bangkok Metropolitan
Electricity Authority (MEA) will construct the electrical distribution system
on behalf of NHA. Agreement was reached during negotiations on the above
procurement procedures.



- 53 -
C. Disbursement
5.03      Disbursements from the proposed loan would be made for 55% of the
cost of civil works and of building materials loans made to Tung Song Hong
residents and 100% of expenditures made for technical, and consultants
services, equipment and materials related thereto, studies and training.
Disbursement for all items would be made against standard Bank documentation
except expenditures for civil works by force account and loans made by NHA for
building materials, which would be disbursed against Statements of Expenditure,
with the supporting documentation retained by the Borrower and held available
for inspection by Bank supervision missions. Retroactive financing is pro-
posed from March 1, 1978, in an aggregate amount not exceeding the equivalent
of US$300,000 under the civil works category. It is expected that Bank dis-
bursements would be completed by December 31, 1981. The estimated quarterly
disbursement schedule is given in Table V-1.
D. Technical Assistance
5.04      The technical assistance to be financed through the project will
strengthen NHA in three general areas: organization and financial manage-
ment, project design and estate management. These needs will be addressed
through the provision of professional services and training, including
regional field trips, work study programs in other agencies and fellowships.
Since both sites and services and slum improvement schemes are new types of
projects for NHA, the technical assistance component will also provide
funds to monitor and evaluate the pilot project. Finally, a small amount of
funds will be provided for equipment, primarily for use in the design of slum
improvement projects. The types, amounts and cost estimates for the various
types of technical assistance are summarized in Table V-2.
Professional Services
5.05      The professional services are intended to support NHA's ongoing
policy review by strengthening financial management and developing appropriate
standards for project design. The terms of reference for these services
were agreed in principle during negotiations. In the procurement of these
services, emphasis will be placed on using local and regional organizations.
5.06      Organization and Financial Management Consulting Services.  An
organization which supplies management consulting services will be hired
to review and make recommendations concerning NHA's financial management,
organization structure and management practices. The analysis of financial
management will concentrate on the identification, reduction and financing of
housing subsidies, the organization and staffing of the Finance Department,
accounting and control of project expenditures, and use of financial data
in management planning and monitoring. The consultants will make recommen-
dations concerning pricing policies and subsidies, management information
systems and processes, accounting practices, manpower requirements and or-
ganization structure. These recommendations will be intended to assist NHA
to become financially self-sufficient and improve internal financial manage-
ment. The organizational analysis will focus primarily on the project cycle,



- 54 -
i.e., planning, design, implementation and monitoring. The consultants will
examine and make recommendations concerning the distribution of responsibility
among divisions, tasking and scheduling practices, managerial control and
coordination within NHA and with external agencies. The contract for these
services will give NRA the option to retain the consultants to assist in the
implementation of recommendations.
5.07      Estate Management Consulting Services.  The consultant will advise
the Estate Management Department on the organization, provision and financing
of maintenance services, the collection of rents and hire-purchase payments
and the sale of rental units. The consultant will pay particular attention
to the scheduling, staffing, management and costs of maintenance services
and recommend ways to achieve cost savings. The consultant will examine rent
levels, collection practictes and performance, and the costs of estate manage-
ment and advise NRA on measures to improve the level of collections as
well as on the adequacy of current rent levels to meet recurrent costs and
recover investment in the buildings.
5.08      Small Business Promotion Consulting Services.  These services
will be used to secure advice on the design and implementation of programs
to attract small businesses to NHA's integrated developments and to assist
existing small businesses in the slums being improved. These programs
will be designed primarily to link NHA project participants with existing
sources of credit, technical and management assistance and training, rather
than to expand the scope of NRA's direct responsibility into the small-
industry sector. For new schemes the consultant will help develop programs to
insure that potential investors have access to credit and technical assistance
and review experience with the Tung Song Hong small industries area to help
prepare guidelines on the provision, pricing and management of serviced land
and structures for small industries in future schemes. For slums to be
improved the consultant will help develop programs to provide credit and
technical and management assistance to existing businesses.
5.09      Engineering Design Adviser.  The Engineering Design Adviser will
work with the NHA Research and Construction Department for a period of two
years and will advise on the design and implementation of both sites and
services and slum improvement projects. He will advise on site planning,
engineering design, costing and tendering during project preparation and
on organization, scheduling and progress reporting during implementation.
In addition to helping NRA staff design and implement specific projects,
the adviser will prepare guidelines on design standards and project
preparation.
Training
5.10      The training component will enable NHA staff members to observe
similar ongoing projects in neighboring countries as well as provide oppor-
tunities for advanced formal training for a limited number of technical staff.
Regional field trips will permit staff members to visit public housing
agencies in two or three other countries to discuss their operations. One
trip would focus primarily on slum improvement programs (probably in Jakarta



- 55 -
and Manila), while the other would be concerned with estate management prac-
tices (probably in Hong Kong and Korea). Five staff members will be exposed
more intensively to slum improvement programs under a work-study arrangement
which would place them in other agencies for three months. Concurrence with
these arrangements was sought from the relevant agencies in Indonesia and
the Philippines prior to negotiations. Eight man-years of fellowships will be
funded in planning, engineering, estate management and finance or economics.
E. Monitoring and Evaluation
5.11      Because both sites and services and slum improvement are new types
of projects for NHA, the projects at Tung Song Hong and King Petch will
be carefully monitored and evaluated. The National Institute of Development
Administration (NIDA), which has a department that provides advisory services
and conducts evaluation studies, has been identified as the most appropriate
agency to monitor the Tung Song Hong project. Monitoring of the slum improve-
ment component will be done primarily by NHA, using the surveys conducted for
project preparation (para 3.15) as baseline data. Assistance in designing and
implementing the monitoring program in the slums will be obtained on a
consultancy basis from the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), which has
studied housing and socio-economic conditions in several Bangkok slums. 1/
5.12      Monitoring of the Tung Song Hong project will focus, inter alia, on
the following issues:
(a) House type-plot size options. The study will examine
the attractiveness of different options to various
types of households and ways in which the families use
and extend the space and structures. Particular attention
will be paid to the nature, timing, organization and costs
of incremental building activities, including the use of
materials loans;
(b) Employment patterns. The analysis of Tung Song Hong
residents' employment patterns will pay particular attention
to the ratio of employment inside and outside the community,
the use of residential plots and the commercial and small
industries areas for economic activities, access to business
credit and technical assistance and the transportation
patterns of residents who work outside Tung Song Hong;
(c)  Site planning and community facilities.  Residents' use of
and satisfaction with various aspects of site development
1/   Although NIDA and AIT have been identified as appropriate agencies to
involve in monitoring and have expressed interest in the project, the
loan documents will not bind NHA to employ either NIDA or AIT. Formal
contractual arrangements will be worked out on the basis of detailed
research proposals to be prepared by mid-1978.



- 56 -
and types of facilities will be assessed to provide guidance
for future schemes.
(d) Affordability. The income and expenditure patterns of Tung
Song Hong residents will be analyzed over time to verify the
affordability assumptions.
(e) Marketability. The demand for the sites and services units
compared to other types of NHA housing will be established.
5.13      Monitoring of slum improvement will, inter alia, concentrate on:
(a) Rent levels, land values and community characteristics. The
extent to which land values and rents rise as a result of
improvements and how the socio-economic character of the
community is altered due to these changes will be assessed.
(b) Affordability. Residents' income and expenditure patterns
will be analyzed to determine the effects of increased land
rents to pay for improvements.
(c) House improvement. The types and values of house improvements
and the arrangements for doing the work will be monitored.
(d) Community facilities and socio-economic programs. Residents'
knowledge of, use of and satisfaction with facilities and
programs provided by the project will be assessed.
5.14      Both monitoring exercises will involve several types of data col-
lection, including open-ended and structured interviews with residents,
on-site observation, analysis of NRA records, and staff interviews. In
addition to final reports presenting the findings of the studies, periodic
progress reports with key indicators of project performance (such as the rates
of settlement and house completion in Tung Song Hong and land rent payments
and arrears in the slums) will be prepared by the monitoring teams to assist
NHA in project management.
F. Supervision
5.15      Supervision of the project on behalf of the Government will be the
responsibility of NRA. Since this is the first Bank-financed project to be
executed by NHA and since it is hoped to form the basis of a much expanded
future program, close monitoring and supervision during early stages of
implementation would be required. It is estimated that supervision by the
Bank staff will require approximately 30 man-weeks of field effort during the
first year and 20 man-weeks during the second and third year, respectively.
For every man-week in the field approximately two man-weeks of office work in
Washington would be required.

VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Cost Recovery
6.01      Maximum cost recovery for the sites and services and slum improve-
ment components has been emphasized to demonstrate the financial viability
of the schemes. NHA and other implementing agencies will levy charges to
beneficiaries in the form of down payments, hire-purchase and loan repayments,
land rents and service charges. These charges are designed to achieve full
recovery of chargeable costs 1/ in the sites and services scheme and along
with revenues from the utilities will do the same in the slum areas.
6.02      In practice, full cost recovery when applied to urban development
requires interpretation. It must be limited by established traditions in
financing certain "off-site" and other public services, such as access roads
and schools, which are not usually paid for directly through housing charges.
The general approach adopted in this project is that all costs which are
normally borne by a developer in a private housing scheme would be passed
on to the beneficiaries. Other expenses that are normally incurred by Govern-
ment agencies in support of private housing schemes will be borne by the
Government.
Sites and Services
6.03      The actual cost of:  land acquisition 2/, site preparation,
on-site infrastructure, core housing, commercial and industrial facilities,
and design and supervision at Tung Song Hong will be directly recovered by
NHA from the beneficiaries through plot sales under hire-purchase agreements
and rents. A 10% down payment will be required for residential plots, with
the balance to be paid over 20 years at 12% annual interest rate. The
repayment period of 20 years reflects the minimum expected life of infra-
structure and core housing to be built in the project area.
6.04      For the commercial and small industries beneficiaries, NHA will
require a 20% down payment for shop-houses, industrial workshops and open
plots, which are to be sold onl hire-purchase arrangements. The cost of the
serviced land and structures will be recovered over 15 years at 12% interest
rate. The food market and hawker stalls will be rented at rates which will
recover the full costs of serviced land and structure amortized at 12%
interest rate over 20 years.
6.05      The residents and commercial and industrial users will also pay
a separate service charge based on plot size. The fee is intended to
recover the following:
1/   At a nominal interest rate of 12% compared to an expected rate of infla-
tion of 6-7%..
2/   That is, purchase price of land acquired in 1966.



- 61 -
(a)  all estate management and administration costs;
(b)  operation and maintenance costs to the extent that
they are not recovered through taxes and other user
charges levied by responsible authorities; and
(c)  capital costs, design fees, construction supervision
and contingencies of the water wells and sewage
treatment plant. 1/
More specifically, operation and maintenance costs include all costs for
roads, footpaths, water supply and sewerage, public park and security of the
site. Garbage collection services will be provided by BMA at no cost to the
residents. The service charge will be revised biennially and, if necessary,
raised to recover increases in estate management and administration costs.
6.06      The total cost of the Tung Song Hong component is B 290 million
including design and supervision and physical and price contingencies, as
summarized in Table II-1 and detailed in Table IV-l. Unit costs on a per
hectare, per plot and per capita basis are summarized in Table VI-1. Based
on these estimates, the costs to be charged to the beneficiaries for plots
are:

Water supply (excl. water wells) 2/              5.25
Sewerage system (excl. treatment plant) 2/    5.45
Landscaping                                           2.00
5% design and supervision                             2.04
15% physical contingency                              6.41
Total chargeable development cost               64.38
(September 1977 prices)
6.07      Unit sales prices have been estimated by dividing total chargeable
on-site development costs (table above) by a fictitious area, which apportions
a greater part of the cost to plots with locational advantage and commercial
potential to produce cross-subsidies within the scheme (Table VI-2). In all,
1/   These costs are estimated as follows:  estate management and administra-
tion, B 0.71 million/year; operation and maintenance, B 1.72 million/year;
and total capital costs to be recovered, B 7.81 million, amortized at
12% over 20 years.
2/   Capital costs of water wells and treatment plant to be recovered through
the service charge (para 6.05).



- 62 -
three different locational pricing zones have been employed (para 4.17). In
addition, higher costs are to be recovered from cores designed for the higher
income groups to produce additional cross-subsidies for the cheaper core
options. The effect of the cross-subsidies will be to substantially lower
charges to the low-income families. Table VI-3 sets out the total cost of
each type of residential plot with on-plot development, the sale price and the
amount of cross-subsidy per unit, on the basis of estimated project costs
including physical contingencies and design costs. The actual sales prices
will be determined on the basis of actual construction costs using the same
principles.
6.08      Loans for building materials will be repaid over 20 years at 12%
interest rate. Other costs for community facilities, off-site infrastructure
(access road and highway overpass) and technical assistance will be financed
from the general revenues oE the Government.
Slum Improvement
6.09      For the slum improvement component, the capital cost of the improve-
ments will be recovered directly from the residents through plot leases,
indirectly from monthly utiLity charges and from general Government revenues.
Included in the direct charges to the beneficiaries will be the improvement
costs including design of footpaths, drainage, canal dredging and solid
waste disposal, which account for 87% of the total cost of infrastructure
improvements in the King Petch slum. The improvement costs for electricity
and water supply would be recovered indirectly through utility charges.
Presently, the level of electricity rates are adequate to recover capital
as well as operation and maintenance costs, whereas water supply rates
recover only about 50% of those charges. The problem of inadequate water
rates in Bangkok is being addressed through the Bank-financed water supply
project. The costs of fire-fighting equipment and community facilities
will be financed from general revenues of the Government following traditional
practice.
6.10      NRA's proposed Slum Upgrading Program approved by the Cabinet did
not envisage cost recovery primarily because of administrative difficulties
in collecting such low charges. Nevertheless, NHA has agreed to try the
preceding arrangement on an experimental basis in this project and, if it
proves feasible, to incorporate it in their program. Assurances were
obtained during negotiations that the proposed cost recovery arrangement will
be implemented in the five slum improvement projects.
6.11      Sixty-seven percent of the land in King Petch and most of the land
in the other four slums designated for upgrading are Government-owned. The
leases for this land will be transferred to NHA, which will then enter
20-year subleases with the current tenants (para 3.18). The rents to be
charged under the revised leases would provide for recovery of the costs of
the infrastructure improvements to be charged directly to lessees as well as
for land rent and administration costs. The rents would be set at an amount
to recover the cost of the improvements over 10 years with an interest rate
of 12%. The rental payments would continue after the initial 10 years, in
order to pay for further necessary improvements.



- 63 -
6.12      The NHA will negotiate with private landowners in King Petch prior
to improving the infrastructure in the community in order to reach agreements
for repayment of their share of the costs of improvements and for improving
the security of their tenants' tenure. There is a risk, however, that some
landlords may refuse to enter such agreements, but it is felt that strong
community pressure will be exerted on these landlords. Even if none of the
private landlords in King Petch pays, approximately 80% of the directly
recoverable project costs would be attributable to residents on Government
land in the five slums.
6.13      Table VI-4 summarizes the unit costs for slum improvement at King
Petch on a per hectare, per dwelling and per capita basis. The total physical
costs to be directly recovered, including design costs and physical contingency
allowance, amount to B 7.48 million (US$0.37 million), about B 5,094 (US$255)
per dwelling 1/ or about B 64 (US$3.18) per sq m. 2/ Monthly payments amount
to B 75 (US$3.75) per dwelling, which is considered to be affordable by the
households in this slum.
Small-Scale Business Assistance
6.14      KTB will make loans to small businesses and industries at Tung Song
Hong and the slums to be improved at the prevailing interest rates for such
loans; based on recent trends, interest rates are likely to be between 12% and
15%. The loans will be repaid in monthly installments over periods of up to
seven years following a grace period of up to three years. The grace period
to the entrepreneurs reflects the amount of time before benefits are to be
realized.
B. Affordability
6.15      The sites and services project is designed to standards that would
make it affordable to the very low-income urban dwellers without Government
subsidies. A reasonable basis for estimating the ability of Tung Song Hong
families to pay for shelter has been to assume that 30%-of household income is
devoted to housing. 3/ About 20% of the project will consist of the cheapest
option (type Al core house on a 70 sq m plot located in the cheapest price
zone) to be priced at B 27,183 (US$1,359), which includes about 16% cross-
subsidization. The hire-purchase payment for this house would be B 273/month,
which is affordable by households earning as little as B 1,377/month, falling
1/   1,468 dwellings.
2/   Average plot size is 80 sq m.
3/   This includes monthly payments for serviced plot, core house, materials
loan (which is optional), service charge including utility charges for
water supply and sewerage, and electricity charge.



- 64 -
roughly at the 14th percentile on the household income curve for Metropolitan
Bangkok. In addition, a small number of options exist at somewhat cheaper
prices for plots with no cores, but an additional cost for building materials
would be required to make the plots habitable. Table VI-5 shows the calcula-
tion of the total monthly payment for housing and the required monthly income
for the different option types. The estimated household income distribution
for Bangkok is shown in Table VI-6.
6.16      The average charge for infrastructure improvements in King Petch is
estimated at about B 5,094 (US$255) per dwelling. The monthly payment amounts
to B 75 (US$3.75) per dwelling or B 54 (US$2.68) per family 1/ and represents
about 3% of the average monthly household income in King Petch 2/. For the
poorest 10% of households, this payment represents about 13% of total monthly
income.
C. Replicability
6.17      Although the proposed project is small in size, affecting about
3,200 families in Tung Song Hong and another 3,500 families in 5 slums, it
represents a new approach to solving housing problems in Bangkok. NHA has
been reluctant to try the sites and services approach on a large scale until
the acceptability of the concept to the beneficiaries is established. In an
environment in which NHA is selling walk-up apartments with higher design
standards at comparable prices, although only through large subsidies, the
virtually unsubsidized Tung Song Hong project faces a tough test. Neverthe-
less, NHA and Bank staff are convinced that there will be a strong demand for
sites and services plots because of the large disparity between supply and
demand and the attractive features of the project, including excellent site
location, individual plots with options for house expansion and on-site job
opportunities. NHA is currently reviewing its 1978-81 housing program in
order to reduce the subsidy by adopting lower-cost housing solutions. Pro-
vision of serviced plots and incremental housing is identified as an important
element in the draft housing program. Successful implementation of the Tung
Song Hong project is expected to have a significant impact on future NHA
housing programs.
6.18      The slum improvement component is the first phase of a larger
Cabinet-approved slum improvement program for Bangkok. The experience
gained in project design, management and community relations during this
phase will provide the basis for substantial expansion of the program.
One of the major constraints on the size of the program is NHA's limited
1/   Assumes 1.4 families per household.
2/   Assumes uniform 5% growth in household income in King Petch between
1976, when the Survey was administered, and 1977.



- 65 -
legal power vis-a-vis private landowners. Consequently, the first phase
of the programs will be restricted primarily to slums on Government land,
with the partial exception of King Petch. However, a committee which reports
to the Minister of the Interior has been established to review Thai legisla-
tion relevant to slum improvement and the legal framework for improvement
in other countries. This committee will recommend legislation which would
enable NHA to operate more effectively in slums on privately owned land.
During negotiations, it was agreed that the Government will share the findings
of this committee with the Bank.
6.19      Formal monitoring and evaluation will be carried out to provide
feedback on modifications for repeating these programs on a much larger
scale. The aim will be not only to produce more low-income housing, but
also to preserve and improve the existing housing stock for the very poor
segment of the population.
D. Project Cash Flow
6.20      The cash flow for the total project is projected in Table VI-7.

VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Project Benefits
7.01      The project would be the Government of Thailand's first sites and
services project and would support the first slum upgrading program to be
undertaken by its housing agency, NRA. It is expected to influence signifi-
cantly NHA's future financial policies and the mix of project types in
its program. A wide variety of benefits will flow from the project, including
provision of new housing for 3,000 families at Tung Song Hong and improvement
of the living environment of residents of about 2,300 other dwelling units in
the 5 slums to be upgraded. Environmental sanitation and health conditions of
the residents of the slums will be improved, and they will gain greater access
to a range of social and economic services. Physical improvements include
construction and upgrading of roads, footpaths and drains, dredging and
rehabilitation of klongs and provision of garbage disposal bins. The hire
purchase and materials loans at Tung Song Hong will allow families to afford
more housing than normally accessible to them at a lower cost to themselves
or, in the case of massively subsidized projects, to the society as a whole.
Secure tenure arrangements in the slums will provide a basis of confidence
for families to improve and extend their shelter and build equity in these
assets.
7.02      Alternatives to agricultural employment are becoming a matter of
significant concern in Thailand. This project will contribute to the develop-
ment of a methodology of creating such jobs with minimal capital expediture as
well as provide additional permanent employment for as many as 1,000 persons
in the commercial/industrial area at Tung Song Hong. Development of NHA's
role as a promoter of small industries at its estates will enhance the public
benefits derived from these projects. The design of the lending program for
small industry supports the Bank's objective of improving institutional
arrangements for small industry lending in Bangkok as well as introduces a new
type and style of lending to small businesses in the slums. Productivity and
job entry potential will be enhanced by the skill training and management
development services associated with the project. Direct employment generated
by the project is estimated at roughly 4,000 man-years.
7.03      Improvement of the slums on Government-owned lands should generate
demands for improvement of slums on private lands as well. These demands
would reinforce the Government's plans to undertake such developments on
a larger scale and to recover the improvement costs.
7.04      The benefits from the social programs are not readily quantifiable;
however, the programs will address important problems in the slum communities,
including family planning, drug use and gang crime and better utilize the
services of existing agencies. To the extent that the programs are success-
ful, benefits should be derived from smaller family sizes, which are reported
to be desired by the people affected, greater productivity and a reduction
in social tensions from the abatement of drug use and gang crime.

B. Economic Analysis
Sites and Services Component
7.05      The imputed rentaL value of the dwellings to be constructed at Tung
Song Hong is the measure of economic benefit used. An NRA survey of rental
values of various types of housing in the vicinity of Tung Song Hong showed
that rental values vary with the quality of the houses and infrastructural
services as well as the size of units. On the basis of these results, the
imputed rental value of the project units is estimated to be about B 15
(US$0.75) per sq m per month for the basic unit on a plot with no locational
advantages (Zone C), compared to rents outside the project area of about B 27
per sq m per month for a high quality dwelling and B 9 per sq m per month for
a poor quality dwelling with minimum infrastructure.
7.06      The benefits from commercial and industrial uses are calculated
on the basis of the estimated market value of the land plus buildings in
the total complex. The practice in Bangkok is to attribute all of the profits
to the land cost and to include buildings at cost. The estimated market
value of land for business purposes in the area of Tung Song Hong is B 800
per sq m. The total cost, including land, related infrastructure and building
are to be recovered over 15 years at 12% interest with a 20% down payment.
The imputed rents of market and hawkers' stall spaces are estimated at B 20
and B 25 per sq m, respectively.
7.07      The cost of all land in the project was adjusted upwards to reflect
market value, which is significantly (43%) higher than the price paid when it
was purchased. Other costs considered include land fill and development,
on-site infrastructure, core housing, materials loans, commercial and indus-
trial buildings and related facilities, imputed value of self-help labor,
physical contingencies and interest during house expansion.
7.08      Using the above assumptions, the internal economic rate of return
on the housing and business components of the Tung Song Hong project is
estimated at 16%. These components represent 61% of total project cost of
B 344.0 million. The rate of return on the housing component (49% of total
project cost) alone is estimated at 17%. The cost of off-site infrastructure
is to be charged to the general Government revenues. While this has not been
added to the costs charged to the purchasers, its implications for the rate
of return on that element of the project have been considered in the sensi-
tivity analyses. All off-site infrastructure, including the access road,
the klong crossing, the railroad crossing and the highway overpass, represent
about 7% of the total costs at Tung Song Hong or 4% of the total project cost.
If they were taken into account, the overall rate of return would still be in
the region of 15%.

7.09      Other sensitivity analyses were carried out with the following
results:

by 20%            14%              14%                  8%
Decrease rental
values by 20%       13%              13%                   8%
Slum Upgrading
7.10      The economic benefits are calculated as the possible increase
in rental values resulting from the physical improvements. Other project
benefits, including improved health and consequent increased labor produc-
tivity, are only imperfectly measured by these increases; however, this method
does give a base-line indication of the benefits to be derived. The practice
in Bangkok for private rentals is to require large "commissions", or key money,
to gain access to a plot and a monthly rental thereafter. In King Petch, this
commission and rentals are presently estimated at B 62.50 per sq m and B 0.50
per sq m per month, respectively. It is anticipated that landlords will be
able to pass all additional improvement costs on to the tenants; consequently,
post-improvement rentals are estimated at B 2.00 per sq m per month. This
includes improvement costs of B 1.00 per sq m and a surcharge of B 0.50
per sq m for new tenure arrangements in lieu of a new commission.
7.11      The costs of physical improvements, including construction and
upgrading of roads, footpaths and drains, dredging and rehabilitation of
canals and provision of garbage disposal bins, plus physical contingencies,
are applied in this analysis. Using these assumptions, the subproject which
accounts for 2% of total project cost produces an economic rate of return of
24%. Should project costs increase by 20%, the rate of return would fall to
20%, while a similar reduction in benefits would drop the return to 19%. If
benefits to private landowners, who control 34% of the land are given a zero
weighting, i.e., applying the unlikely assumption that they do not participate
in the benefits either by paying for the improvements or by increasing rents
to their tenants, the rate of return would fall to 15%. The composite rate
of return on the sites and services and slum upgrading components is 16%.
Utilities
7.12      The costs of providing water supply and electricity are in line
with the cost of such services in Bangkok and are to be recovered through the



- 76 -
rate structure in the case of electricity and water supply at King Petch
and through monthly service charges which incorporate water supply at Tung
Song Hong. Although no specific calculation of a rate of return is useful
for these items in this context, it is important to note that the Electricity
Authority has recently raised its rates in line with policies to achieve
adequate rates of return, while MWWA, supported by the Bank, has under-
taken to raise its rates for the same purpose.
C. Distribution of Benefits
7.13      The project will directly benefit approximately 35,000 persons
living in Bangkok. The sites and services component, which accounts for about
half that number, will offer 20% of the plots to households earning as little
as B 1,380 per month, falling roughly at the 14th percentile on the household
income curve for Metropolitan Bangkok. In the slums to be improved approxi-
mately 25% of the project beneficiaries are estimated to be at or below the
urban poverty level.
VIII. CONCLUSION, RECOMMENDATIONS AND LOAN CONDITIONS
8.01      The project is viewed as a comprehensive pilot project.  The
sites and services component introduces a new approach to the shelter
problem of Bangkok's urban poor, which is expected to be financially
viable and technically acceptable to the beneficiaries. The slum
improvement component of the project serves as a launching vehicle
for the Slum Upgrading Program of NHA in Bangkok. The small-scale
business program provides on-site job opportunities, especially for
women. Technical assistance is intended to support NHA's reevaluation
of its program and policies. Even though the project is small in terms
of its size and impact, it represents a significant improvement over
existing NHA programs and is expected to lead to larger projects bear-
ing more policy significance.
8.02      Since both sites and services and slum improvement are new types
of schemes for NHA, the project inherently entails some risk. The vir-
tually unsubsidized plots at Tung Song Hong will be offered to households on
NHA's waiting list nearly simultaneously with several of NHA's heavily
subsidized conventional housing schemes. Nevertheless, a strong demand for
the Tung Song Hong units is anticipated because the supply of units in this
price range is miniscule compared to the demand, and many households are
likely to prefer expandable core units on their own plots to walk-up flats.
Furthermore, NHA may have substantially reduced the subsidies for its other
units by the time the plots in Tung Song Hong are ready. The major risk
in the slum improvement component concerns cost recovery. There is the
likelihood that some private landlords in King Petch will be unwilling to pay
for improvements; it is also possible, but much less likely, that political



- 77-
and administrative obstacles may hinder cost recovery from slum dwellers on
Government lands. The business lending component is small and novel for both
NHA and KTB; unless sufficient appropriately oriented staff are assigned to
it and smooth arrangements between NHA and KTB are worked out, it may not
develop as planned.
8.03      During negotiations, agreements were reached on:
(a) terms of land leases in the improved slums (para 3.18);
(b) amount of retroactive financing required (para 5.01);
(c) procurement procedures to be followed in the project
(para 5.02); and
(d) terms of reference for consultancy services to be provided
through technical assistance (para 5.05).
8.04      During negotiations, assurances were obtained that:
(a) Government and NHA will explore possible alternatives
and provide a permanent access to the Tung Song Hong site
by June 30, 1979 (para 2.04);
(b) the proposed community facilities at Tung Song Hong and
at the improved slums would be adequately staffed and
equipped by the agencies responsible (paras 2.08 & 2.13);
(c) RTG will exchange views with the Bank regarding any
changes being considered in NHA's financial arrangements,
criteria for cost recovery and construction program
(para 3.03);
(d) NHA will (i) in respect of all project activities operate
and maintain separate accounting records and bank account;
(ii) provide adequate working capital to finance the
project; and (iii) have the project accounts audited
annually by independent auditor acceptable to the Bank
(para 3.04);
(e) NHA will adequately staff the Slum Upgrading Office and
Commercial Section to implement the project (para 3.05);
(f) NHA will continue to elicit the support of slum resi-
dents during planning and implementation stages (para
3.16);
(g) RTG will cause NHA to make satisfactory arrangements to
relocate any residents in Bangkok who are required to move
as a result of carrying out the project and provide them
with adequate compensation (para 3.17);



- 78 -
(h) BMA will provide satisfactory garbage collection service
in the project areas (para 4.15);
(i) KTB will provide the loan funds and staff necessary to
undertake the small business loan program (para 4.46);
(j) the small business program will be monitored through a
co-ordinating committee of all agencies involved and
chaired by NHA (para 4.47);
(k) the proposed cost recovery arrangements will be imple-
mented in the five slum improvement subprojects (para
6.10); and
(1) the Government would share with the Bank the findings
of the committee :reviewing legislation concerning slum
lands (para 6.18)..
8.05      The project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$8.6 million equi-
valent.
