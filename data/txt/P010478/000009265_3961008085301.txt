MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A
NWFP COMMUNITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND NRA STRENGTHENING PROJECT
1.         I submit for your approval the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR 13.7 million (US$21.5 million equivalent)
to help finance a NWFP Comnunity Infrastructure and NHA Strengthening Project. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years. The proceeds of the development credit
would be retained partly by the Government of Pakistan (GOP) and partly provided to the Government
of North-West Frontier Province (GONWFP) in accordance with GOP's standard procedures.
Cofinancing from the Swiss Development Cooperation and UNICEFY' is confirmed.
2.         County/Sector Background. Pakistan is a low income country with GNP per capita
estimated at US$416 per year in 1992. Its population is 110 milliorn' and is growing rapidly at a rate
of over 3% per annum. Urbanization has been proceeding at a fast pace and by 1992 the share of urban
population had increased to almost one third. Projections are that by the turn of the century the
population will increase by over 30 million, with half the increase occurring in urban areas. Pakistan's
economic growth performance has been fairly impressive during the last decade when the GDP growth
rate averaged 6%. Recent economic growth, however, has been accompanied by large and growing
macroeconomic imbalances which could seriously affect future growth. Pakistan also performs very
poorly in its human development indicators, which could prove to be an important long-term constraint.
3.         The North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) had a population of about 16 million in 1991,
making it the third largest province in Pakistan. Nearly 84% of the population is rural, although urban
areas are growing faster than rural areas. Over a third of all its households rely on wells as a primary
source of drinking water, and about 20% rely on sources such as ponds, rivers, streams and springs.
Almost all urban and two-thirds of rural housing units have access to electricity. Compared to other
provinces, dwellings in rural areas are much more likely to have private kitchens, bathrooms, and
latrines, which is consistent with cultural values that emphasize privacy, although facilities are frequently
rudimentary. Polluted ponds and solid waste accumulating in streets and vacant lots are familiar sights
in many communities. Unsurfaced roads and footpaths that become impassable during the rainy season
are common.
4.         Federal, provincial and local government are each involved in infrastructure provision,
although in NWFP the provincial government plays the major role. Working at the community level,
UNICEF has been active in developing small-scale infrastructure schemes (e.g., hand pumps) and in
providing health and sanitation education. Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) and Community-
1/ United Nations Intemational Children's Educational Fund.
2/ 1990 estimate. The estimated population in 1993 was approximately 120 million.



- 2 -
Based Organizations (CBO) have also contributed directly and indirectly to infrastructure development.
The private sector, particularly the informal sector, has been a primary driving force behind housing
development, but with services being rarely provided at the time of development. As a result, basic
infrastructure in low-income community areas is typically very inadequate. Unlike other provinces,
illegal squatter settlements and katchi abadis are rarely found in NWFP, due in part to strong traditional
ties to land, and development has typically been through sub-division and sale of private land although
these sales are rarely officially recorded. Similarly, subdivision and building permits are obtained only
in exceptional circumstances. Governments' ability to respond to these infrastructure deficiencies has
been constrained by institutional arrangements in which responsibilities overlap, and which do not
encourage inter-agency cooperation; by financial constraints; by the lack of a clear policy framework for
dealing with such issues as cost recovery, infrastructure standards, subsidies, and targeting of
beneficiaries; by a failure to effectively operate and maintain existing infrastructure; and by lack of
provisions for directly involving communities.
5.         Project Obiectives.  To address the infrastructure needs of low-income communities,
GONWFP has accordingly formulated a policy framework for infrastructure upgrading which it proposes
to implement through the project. The project's main objective would be to increase the productivity and
well being of low-income groups in NWFP through improving their living conditions by provision of
basic infrastructure.  This would be achieved by: (a) infrastructure upgrading and community
development in existing urban and rural low-income settlements; (b) promoting the use of demand-driven,
participatory design procedures and affordable standards for infrastructure; (c) strengthening the ability
of provincial and local governments to collaborate with communities to implement low-income
infrastructure programs; and (d) promoting sustainable arrangements for operating and maintenance
(O&M) of basic services.
6.         Project Description. The project components are as follows: (a) urban slum and rural
settlement community infrastructure upgrading in about 55 urban and rural communities in NWFP
including provision of water supply, stormwater drainage, flood protection, streets and footpaths,
sanitation and solid waste management, provision of incentive grants towards the costs of on-plot
sanitation facilities, carrying out community development, health and hygiene education (with integrated
support from UNICEF), and wherever requested by the community, improvement of land registration
facilities and documentation, and provision of design and implementation assistance; (b) provision of
institutional development including a study for strengthening LGERDD, institutionalizing infrastructure
functions within LGERDD and strengthening local councils, and technical assistance for strengthening
NHA including data analysis, sector monitoring, evaluation and dissemination, building technology
evaluation and dissemination, policy development and information exchange. The project would introduce
policy reforms related to affordable and appropriate standards for infrastructure, using demand driven
planning techniques, introducing community participation in infrastructure selection, design,
implementation and cost recovery, and establishing sustainable O&M procedures.
7.         The total project cost is estimated at US$38.8 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange
component of US$14.9 million equivalent (38%) and taxes and duties estimated at about US$1.6 million
equivalent. The proposed IDA credit of US$21.5 million equivalent would finance about 55% of project
costs, covering 93% of foreign exchange and 32% of local currency requirements. Swiss Development
Cooperation co-financing of US$3.45 million equivalent3' would finance 9% of project costs, and
UNICEF would provide parallel financing of about US$0.5 million (1%). Federal government (1%),
3/ SDC has made an initial commitment of US$3.45 million equivalent for the first 3 years of the project. It would
consider providing further funding after 3 years if required, subject to satisfactory progress.



- 3 -
provincial government (16%), beneficiary communities (8%), households participating in on-plot
sanitation schemes (7%) and local councils (3%) would finance the balance. The project financing plan
is summarized in Schedule A. The project was prepared using US$1.3 million of funding from IDA's
Project Preparation Facility, and from grants provided from Japan and Switzerland. Retroactive financing
would be provided to cover eligible foreign and local expenditures on civil works, materials, incremental
staff, vehicles and equipment, consultancy services and training up to US$900,000 equivalent, incurred
after October 15, 1994 and before credit signing, needed in order to maintain the momentum achieved
during project preparation and to prevent delays in implementation of critical project activities. A
breakdown of project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of
procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. A timetable
of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are presented in
Schedules C and D, respectively. A map is also attached. The Staff Appraisal Report (No. 15341-PAK)
is being distributed separately.
8.         Project Implementation. The project is community-based, within a policy framework which
gives priority to communities that: (a) are geographically spread across NWFP, are low-income and lack
basic infrastructure, and that exceed three thousand persons; (b) demonstrate commitment through their
capacity for social organization and financial contribution by organizing themselves into broadly based,
officially registered CBOs, including representation of women, for assuming joint responsibility for
selection, design and implementation, and full responsibility for O&M of infrastructure, and that
contribute any land required and at least 20% of the capital cost of non-trunk infrastructure and all O&M
costs; (c) are supported by their local councils through a contribution of at least 10% of the capital cost
of non-trunk infrastructure; and (d) are willing to carry out schemes in accordance with appropriate
planning, design and construction standards.
9.         Due to the localized nature of the infrastructure investments, and due to its close links to
local councils, GONWFP has selected the Local Government, Elections and Rural Development
Department (LGERDD) to implement the project. As LGERDD has limited technical capacity, and little
previous experience of donor-funded projects, it would be supported by NWFP's existing Project
Management Unit and Project Implementation Units, suitably strengthened with additional staff and
consultants, and by active involvement of CBOs in the beneficiary communities. The GONWFP's
components would be coordinated by a Steering Committee, chaired by the Secretary of LGERDD,
assisted by a Working Committee, with high level monitoring by a Project Review Board under the
Additional Chief Secretary, Development. The studies and institutional development components would
be implemented by respective beneficiary agencies (LGERDD and the National Housing Authority).
10.        Project Sustainability. The project's sustainability would be strengthened by involving
communities and local councils directly in scheme choice, design, and financing. The communities would
make up-front contributions covering at least 20% of the on-site infrastructure costs and, thereby, enhance
their "ownership" of the schemes. Furthermore, prior to construction of infrastructure, the community
would be aware of O&M consequences of schemes, and written agreements would be in place for
adopting completed infrastructure, for provision of O&M, and for O&M financing. Satisfactory O&M
of earlier phases of project infrastructure would be a prerequisite for future phases of investment.
Arrangements would be established to monitor sustainability, to feedback, and where appropriate to revise
project methodologies to enhance sustainability.
11.        With a view to institutionalizing procedures for future replication, consideration would be
given, for the longer term, to full incorporation of the Project Management Unit's community



infrastructure functions within LGERDD, together with transfer of experienced staff. Options would be
reviewed as part of the project-financed LGERDD institutional development study.
12.        Lessons Learned from  Previous IDA Operations.  IDA's experience of community
infrastructureprojects and infrastructure upgrading highlights the importance of political, institutional and
community support for avoiding project delays, for achieving cost recovery, for satisfactory
implementation and for O&M. Overly complex projects do not perform well. Upgrading in the Punjab
Urban Development Project (Cr. 1895-PAK) has satisfactorily improved access to basic infrastructure,
has leveraged additional investment by householders to further improve living conditions, and has
demonstrated innovative designs. Nevertheless, cost recovery, adoption of completed assets, and the iack
of a structured form of community participation have caused difficulties. The infrastructure upgrading
component of the Karachi Special Development Project (Cr. 1652-PAK) experienced uneven cost
recovery due to poor organization and weak management, but appropriate infrastructure standards have
started to be adopted by government agencies. Pakistan, however, is home to the Orangi Pilot Project--
one of best-known success stories of community-based and community-financed infrastructure--and the
incrementally developed Khuda Ki Basti project in Hyderabad. Lessons from both previous projects and
NGO-based schemes would be applied in the project, through the development of a demand-led,
community based approach. New policies and approaches have accordingly been developed, with Trust
Fund assistance provided by Japan and Switzerland and administered by IDA. These have been tested
in two pilot projects, with works financed by GONWFP and executed by community self-help, with
technical assistance financed by a Project Preparation Facility (PPF 761-0 PAK). Early results indicate
an improved level of beneficiary satisfaction, with increased "ownership" of the infrastructure created.
13.        Rationale for IDA Involvement. This project is fully consistent with the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) discussed by the Executive Directors on December 19, 1995. A primary objective of the
CAS for Pakistan is poverty reduction. The focus of this project upon low-income communities would
directly assist achievement of this objective by increasing the coverage and quality of basic infrastructure
which, together with community development programs, would improve living conditions and alleviate
some of the acute symptoms of poverty. IDA's experience in Pakistan demonstrates that infrastructure
upgrading is one of the more effective ways of providing basic services to low-income groups. The
Bank's urban policy and housing policy papers both support upgrading as a strategy to increase access
of the poor to infrastructure and housing to meet basic needs. Project implementation would benefit from
IDA's national and international experience of upgrading. IDA's involvement would also support
government's attempt to apply a demand-led, participatory approach.
14.        Actions Agreed. During negotiations agreements were reached on: (a) establishing a Project
Review Board, a Project Steering Committee and a Project Working Committee; (b) establishing
Directorates of the Project Management Unit for Planning and Community Development, Design and
Implementation, Monitoring and Evaluation and a Finance Wing, and strengthening Project
Implementation Units; (c) an implementation plan, and arrangements for its annual updating; (d) the basis
for selection of infrastructure and community development schemes including selection criteria, and the
processes for scheme design, finance, implementation and maintenance; (e) the use of model
documentation for agreements between the government, the CBO concerned and the local council to make
clear respective responsibilities; (f) arrangements for monitoring and for carrying out a mid-term review;
and (g) arrangements for dealing with resettlement, should any occur. The project has been approved
by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) and the coramunity
infrastructure design and implementation consultants are selected.  Appointment of key staff and
consultants and fulfilling conditions of effectiveness of the Swiss contribution would be conditions of
effectiveness.



15.        Poytv Category. The project is part of IDA's program of targeted intervention due to its
focus on low-income communities. The project would provide a direct impact in terms of improving
living conditions of poorer households. Women and children would be the primary beneficiaries of the
infrastructure upgrading.
16.        Environmental Aspects. The community infrastructure component is designed to improve
the living environment for urban and rural low-income communities, and accordingly the overall
environmental impact of the proposed works would be beneficial. Communities, with technical guidance,
would be required to choose environmentally sound project components or combinations of components
(e.g., on-site sanitation would not be an option if it would degrade ground water used for drinking).
Scheme approval would be contingent upon satisfying environmental and health criteria meeting IDA's
requirements. Environmental Impact Assessments have been prepared for 18 of 20 Phase 1 sites. No
resettlement is required for the schemes for which detailed designs are prepared. Due to the relatively
small scale of the investments at the site level, it is not anticipated that any resettlement would be required
under the project. This project has received a B rating under the IDA's Environmental Assessment
Operational Guidelines.
1 7,       Program Objective Categories. The project would address poverty, women's development,
enviromnent and public sector management.
18.        Participatory Approach. Beneficiary communities, in the form of CBOs and user groups,
are directly involved in identification, planning, design and implementation of project schemes. Other
stakeholders, such as local councils, are also active participants in key decisions. Communities and local
councils both contribute to capital costs, thus ensuring that both have a voice in design and
implementation. The incentives for participation include access to the project-funded infrastructure and
community development activities, training and technical assistance.
19.        Beneficiaries. It is estimated that the project will benefit about 420,000 people living in
low-income communities, in urban and rural areas, throughout NWFP.
20.        Project Benefits. Through provision of basic infrastructure, the project would alleviate some
of the acute symptoms of poverty, and lay the foundation for improved access to basic services in the
future. The main investment component, infrastructure upgrading, is expected to produce high benefit
levels. First, households would decide what services they want based on their needs and ability to pay,
helping to ensure that highly-valued projects are undertaken, and that projects would be maintained so
as to produce a long stream of benefits. Second, upgrading targets low-income households because the
poor are more likely than higher-income households to occupy inadequately-serviced areas. Finally, the
stealn of benefits would be intensified because of cultural factors which cause women and children in
the province to spend large amounts of time in and around their residences. Complementary health
education programs would improve the utilization of infrastructure and maximize the return from
infrastructure investments.
21.        Health improvements would be the primary benefits derived from improved water supply,
drainage, solid waste disposal, and sanitation facilities. Improved health results from both increased
quantity and quality of water, and in rural areas, easier access to water. Drainage prevents the
accumulation of used water, which is a source of disease and groundwater contamination. The collection
and disposal of solid waste improves the residential environment, and prevents drains and sewers from
clogging. Improved sanitation facilities result in safer disposal of excreta, and less contamination of
drinking water supplies. In addition to alleviating some of the symptoms of poverty, upgrading could,



-6 -
to an extent, directly reduce poverty by increasing productivity and income generation.  Higher
productivity could result from better health and less time spent collecting water and maintaining dwellings
(for example, buildings previously needing frequent repair due to poor drainage). Improved services
could make some types of home-based businesses possible. Eguiy considerations arise in addition to the
health, productivity, and economic benefits described above. The project would help narrow the gap in
services between the rich and poor. Women and children are the primary beneficiaries of infrastructure
upgrading; these are the groups which are suffering the most from poor living conditions.
22.        Economic Analysis. The estimated average Economic Rate of Return (ERR) is 31 %. The
value of infrastructure upgrading has been measured in terms of a "catch-all" measure, the resulting
increase in land values, which reflects the benefits arising from environmental improvements in quality
of life as well as consumer welfare gains from enhancements in service levels. Although infrastructure
provision can increase plot values in Pakistan by as much as 50% to 150%, as rudimentary infrastructure
would exist in the project communities, the project's ERR is conservatively estimated assuming property
value increases of 20% to 25%.
23.        Risks. The project is subject to several risks:
(a)   Lack of confidence between communities and government. Mutual confidence between
communities and government is required for communities to want to become involved in
and contribute financially to the project, and for government to develop the skills,
motivation and capacity to involve communities fully. There is a risk that building this
confidence will be a source of delay. Accordingly, implementation would be phased,
building on the experience of pilot projects and, with careful monitoring, to enable
Government's capacity to grow gradually. The beneficial results of early schemes would
be publicized, in order to develop awareness among NGOs and communities. The project
methodology would include a development cycle for both parties to jointly identify and
prepare each scheme, allowing time for relationships to develop.
(b)   Management and institutional weakness. The risk of implementation delays and inadequate
performance is being addressed by implementing the project in phases, in order to gradually
develop project management, community mobilization and implementation capacities. The
initial stage of implementation would focus upon strengthening the Project Management
Unit's and LGERDD's institutional capacity and building upon the experience of the
community infrastructure schemes already underway. Development of a community liaison
capacity, staff training, involvement of UNICEF, close and continuous monitoring by the
Steering Committee and external supervision would support the government's attempt to
apply the participative approach.
(c)   Communities may opt to wait for alternative schemes offered at "no cost". Despite
perceiving project benefits, communities may opt to wait for an alternative government
infrastructure scheme offered on a "no cost" basis. However, these schemes are under-
funded so that the risk of a long wait is high, and the quality of work financed has been
poor. The project is designed to manage this risk by ensuring that communities are fully
aware of their choices and obligations at the outset before electing to join the project. New
communities would be selected in place of any which eventually proved unwilling to
participate.



- 7 -
(d)  Poor inter-institutional coordination. The community infrastructure component requires
coordination between the various agencies active in the sector, and coordination with
alternative programs. An interdepartmental Steering Committee would be established for
this purpose, including the planning, finance, public health, and physical planning
departments. In addition, the Steering Committee would be assisted by a Working
Committee for day-to-day coordination. The scheme identification and mobilization process
would achieve coordination at the local level by involving major stakeholders.
(e)   Under-representation of women's views. There are potential problems ensuring women are
fully involved in the project. For example, women may not be allowed to meet outside the
home with community workers. Special outreach efforts would therefore be necessary to
ensure that women's views are reflected in project design. Initial actions would include:
employment of female social organizers; incorporation of women's support programs; health
and hygiene awareness training directed towards women; and a requirement for women's
representation on CBOs. Pilot schemes for women groups' formation and capacity building
would be developed.
(f)  Inadequate operation and maintenance. A traditional risk with basic infrastructure in
Pakistan is inadequate O&M, which diminishes or curtails the benefits of development
works. To mitigate this risk, communities would be organized, trained and assisted to
arrange O&M themselves. Accordingly, actions would be taken to form community user
groups for O&M at an early stage of the community mobilization process, and communities
would specifically commit to undertake O&M when selecting infrastructure. Community
mobilization, technical assistance and monitoring would emphasize and facilitate good O&M
practices.
24.        Sensitivity Analysis. Delays and poor coordination could increase costs, and a high rate of
communities opting out of the project could raise overheads. The sensitivity analysis shows that the
project's Net Present Value remains positive (using a 30% discount rate) after increasing the base costs
by 10%. The ERR drops to 19.5%. The NPV remains positive even after increasing base costs by 20%.
Poor design (through, say, insufficient attention to women's requirements), or inadequate O&M could
reduce the level of benefits. Net benefits are negative when plot values only increase by about 15%.
However, benefits are expected to exceed this amount because the extensive community participation in
scheme selection and planing is anticipated to avoid inappropriate design, and the basis of estimating land
value increase, which underpins the analysis, to an extent already allows for inadequate O&M.
25.        Recommendation. I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply with
the Articles of Agreement of Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve it.
