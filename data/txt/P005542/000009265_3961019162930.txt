IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
SULTANATE OF OMAN
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT (LOAN NO. 2799-OMA)
PREFACE
This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Third Education Project
(Ln.2799-OMA) in the Sultanate of Oman, for which a loan of US$13.8 million equivalent was
approved on April 21, 1987 and made effective on October 15, 1987.
The loan was closed on December 31, 1994, the original closing date.  Final
disbursement took place on December 13, 1993, and the last refund for the Special Account was
made on April 17, 1995. The undisbursed balance of US$810,839.95 was cancelled with effect
on December 20, 1994, the date on which cancellation was requested by the Borrower.
The ICR was prepared by the Human Resources Division (MN2HR) of the Middle East
and North Africa Region and was reviewed by Jacques Baudouy, Division Chief (MN2HR) and
Gianni Brizzi, Project Advisor (MN2DR).
Preparation of the ICR begun in March 1995 during the completion mission. The report
is based on material in the project files and from information gathered during the ICR mission.
The Borrower contributed to preparation of the ICR by providing its report which has been
included as Annex 3 to the ICR.

THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2799-OMA)
SULTANATE OF OMAN
EVALUATION SUMMARY
Introduction
1.    The rapid expansion of Oman's Education and Training System (ETS) during the 1970
and early 1980s led to a dramatic increase in enrollments at the primary and secondary levels
(over 15 percent annually from 1981 to 1985) and poor local planning for schools. This severely
taxed the capacity of the Ministry of Education (MOE) to plan and administer the system and
operate the schools. Moreover, the availability of trained national teachers at the time of the
project's design (1986) was quite low, and many schools were operated entirely by foreign staff;
the quality of the teaching staff needed to be improved as well as the quantity of trained Omani
teachers and principals. The system also needed to provide greater access for girls to schooling,
particularly in rural areas. Female participation in the public sector labor force rose rapidly (an
increase of 81 percent between 1979 and 1982), yet women represented only 7 percent of Omani
public sector employment in 1982.
2.    The Government's priorities at the time the project was designed included: (i)
development of the formal education system, including primary, preparatory, secondary general,
specialized schools and post-secondary teacher training; (ii) improving the quality and
effectiveness of existing programs; and (iii) establishing effective monitoring and review
procedures to assist future development of the country's ETS. Bank assistance responded to
these goals and the First Education Project (Loan 980-OMA) was approved in 1974. It helped to
lay the foundations of a modem ETS and was implemented successfully. The Second Education
Project (Loan 2419-OMA) was approved in 1984 and continued the Government's priority
objectives.  It established a teacher training college, three general secondary schools, and
provided technical assistance to improve the curricula and central services of the MOE. The
Third Education Project (Loan 2799-OMA) was approved in 1987 and consolidated previous
Bank efforts and Government priorities to develop a modern school system.
Project Objectives
3.    Original project objectives included: (i) the development of key services (management,
planning and curriculum development) in the MOE, which was later expanded to include expert
assistance and fellowship training for education planning and the production of educational TV;



- iii -
(ii) the training and upgrading of teachers; and (iii) increased access to education, particularly for
girls and children of the poor in rural areas.
To carry out these objectives, the project provided:
(a)   specialist services and fellowship training for institutional development of MOE
personnel; and
(b)   construction, equipment and furniture for three teacher training colleges, five
secondary schools and thirty primary schools.
These objectives were appropriate and timely in addressing priority needs of the ETS, as well as
the Government's Omanization goals for the labor force.
Implementation Experience and Results
4.    Implementation.  The project was well implemented by the Borrower and, with the
exception of the technical assistance component, was completed three years ahead of schedule
(civil works and equipment/furniture procurement). As a result of the full use of the facilities,
the project's development impact has been substantial.  Project-financed institutions became
overcrowded and additional classrooms have been added to each school and college. Overall
project costs were significantly (about 8 percent) below appraisal estimates due to efficient bulk
procurement of equipment and furniture for the thirty-eight educational facilities constructed, as
well as underutilization of technical assistance allocations.
5.    The original institutional development component of the project was restructured and
implemented under a management services technical assistance (TA) package by UNESCO. A
further refinement was made to the package after contract signature - a subcomponent to develop
training programs for headteachers and school supervisors was added. The new TA program
included (i) an educational planning component; (ii) a training program for headteachers and
school supervisors; (iii) an educational technology component; and (iv) a component to improve
the technical capabilities of the MOE's Curriculum Development Department. Two subprojects
of component (iv) -- the improvement and innovation of drawing, photography and printing by
means of computers; and equipment for a workshop to produce educational materials -- were
dropped. All other programs were completed satisfactorily, albeit with some delay.
6.    The Bank's performance was satisfactory during the project design and implementation
phases. However, Bank staff were unsuccessful in speeding up implementation of the TA
component although consistent efforts were made to obtain action plans and the status of ongoing
and proposed programs. The Borrower's performance was quite good at all phases of the
project's life. Procurement of civil works and the equipping and furnishing of the educational



- iv -
facilities supported under the project were completed two years ahead of schedule (Part II, Table
5 refers). Government was also unable to speed up the progress of TA implementation.
7.    Results.  The project's outcome is highly satisfactory as it has achieved its major
objectives, particularly in improving access to education, especially girls' education (63 percent
of total enrollments at project-financed schools). Enrollment targets envisaged at the project
design phase have exceeded expectations, and the objective of improving the quality of schooling
has been met by, inter alia, the cadre of primary teachers (Part II, Table 6). The project has
achieved substantial development results in spite of the delays in implementing the TA program.
A noteworthy item produced by the Curriculum Development Department was a film on the
origin of water and its relevance to life which recently won first prize in the Gulf States
competition for educational TV programs. Some staff in this department were trained under the
TA component of the project and new equipment for their use in producing educational films was
acquired with project financing.
8.    Sustainability. The project is likely to maintain and exceed its developmental objectives,
particularly in the areas of school enrollments and the improved quality of teaching.
Summary of Findings and Key Lessons Learned
9.    The project was well executed and the impact of its developmental objectives has been
substantial.  The educational facilities constructed have contributed in meeting the large
enrollment needs of the country. Actually, the need was so large that double shifting had to be
resorted to. Additional investments in primary school construction to meet current needs and to
alleviate double shifting is warranted. Special attention should be paid to the appointment of
Omani nationals to staffing positions to further reduce the number of expatriate teaching staff at
project-financed schools. The country is 'graduated' from Bank lending, and no follow up
operation is anticipated. Delays in the TA component indicated that:
(a)   local capacity to adequately select, manage and monitor experts who implement
TA programs was not addressed adequately when the TA package was designed;
(b)   responsibility for TA implementation should have been lodged in a single unit
within the MOE, as the involvement of several entities in TA management led to
implementation delays; and
(c)   there was insufficient reporting on the progress of the TA package by the
TA provider. Efficient progress reporting could have minimized delays.






IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
THE SULTANATE OF OMAN
THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2799-OMA)
PART I: PROJECT IMPLEMIENTATION ASSESSMENT
A. Introduction
1.    Sector Background.  The school system  in Oman is operated by the Ministry of
Education (MOE) [formerly the Ministry of Education and Youth] and encompasses primary
(grades 1-6), lower secondary (grades 7-9) and upper secondary education (grades 10-12), as
well as teacher training for the primary grades. Secondary school teachers are trained at the
Faculty of Education at Sultan Qaboos University.  The rapid expansion of the system during
the 1970 and early 1980s led to poor local planning for schools and the dramatic increase in
enrollments over the period 1980/81 (106,932) to 1984/85 (191,454) severely taxed the capacity
of the MOE to plan and administer the system and operate the schools.  Moreover, the
availability of trained national teachers at the time of the project's design was quite low, and
many schools were operated entirely by foreign staff; the quality of the teaching staff needed to
be improved as well as the quantity of trained Omani teachers and principals. The system also
needed to provide greater access for girls to schooling, particularly in rural areas.
2.    Government Policy and Sector Strategy. The Third Education project was designed
during the implementation of the Government's third Five-Year Plan (1986-90) which stressed
human resources development as a means of promoting Omanization through development of the
formal education system; improving the quality and effectiveness of existing programs; and
establishing effective monitoring and review procedures to assist future development of the
education and training system. Some of the Government's priorities for the sector included: (i)
enrollment of all six-year olds in primary schools by 1990, expanding access at the base of the
system to rural children and girls; (ii) continued expansion of access to upper secondary
education in rural areas; (iii) expansion of teacher training facilities in rural areas; and (iv)
improved, cost-effective planning and operation of the school system through reduced repetition,
increased teacher-class ratios and the introduction of school building maintenance.
3.    Bank Assistance Strategy.  The Third Education Project consolidated previous Bank
efforts to assist the Government in its development of a modern school system. The First
Education Project (Loan 980-OMA) helped to lay the foundations of a modern education and
training system and assisted the MOE to design, plan and execute education programs. The
Second Education Project (Loan 2419-OMA) established a teacher training college, three general



secondary schools for boys and one for boys. Besides the thirty-eight educational facilities it
financed, the Third Education Project continued a technical assistance (TA) program (for which
Bank financing had begun under the Second Education Project - Loan 2419-OMA). The
redesigned TA program was to improve the quality of education planning; educational
technology and curriculum development facilities at the MOE.
B. Project Objectives
4.    Project Design. The project benefitted from the lessons learned from the implementation
experience of the first and second education projects, which stressed the need to link short-term
overseas training and short-term use of experts closely with institutional development. Original
project objectives included: (i) the development of key services (management, planning and
curriculum development) in the MOE, which was later expanded to include expert assistance and
fellowship training for education planning and the production of educational TV; (ii) the training
and upgrading of teachers; and (iii) increased access to education, particularly for girls and for
children of the poor in rural areas. As noted in para.3 above, the originally designed TA
program of the Second Education Project was merged with the TA of the Third Education
project. The revised TA program was implemented by UNESCO under a management services
contract. This TA included, inter alia, Government priorities in education planning and the use
of technology to enhance the preparation of the curricula and television (TV) production for
school use.
Project Description and Components
5.    To carry out these objectives, the project provided:
(a)   specialist services and fellowship training for institutional development of MOE
personnel; and
(b)   construction, equipment and furniture for three teacher training colleges, five
secondary schools and thirty primary schools.
C. Evaluation of Project Objectives
6.    Project financed school construction was designed to provide access for over 9,000
primary and 3,000 secondary students, of which 3,100 places were for women (2,000 at
primary, 850 at secondary and 250 at the teacher training institutes). Actual student enrollments
for project financed schools (see Part II, Table 6) indicate that appraisal targets were surpassed at
each level and the access of girls exceeded that of boys. The project has, nevertheless only
partially addressed the large enrollment needs of the country - its contribution was modest in
comparison with actual needs. Specific figures are shown in Table A below.

* NOTE:  One out of the three teacher training colleges was for women (240 places versus an actual
enrollment of 361 girls).
7.        Project-financed  schools  absorbed  about  10  percent of the  increase  in  primary
enrollments during the period 1984/85-1994/95 (see Table B below). In order to meet its
enrollment needs, Government has resorted to double shifting and construction of additional
classrooms at project-financed and other schools. The most recent estimates (1987-92) of gross
1                                                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~2
enrollment ratios' for the primary level are 104 percent for males and 96 percent for females.

8.     The project's design and objectives adequately reflected the Government's priorities for
the sector and counterpart ability to implement them, particularly in the areas of facilities design
and construction, which were completed in record time (Part II, Table 5). The institutions and
schools were originally planned to be finished by mid-1993 but were fully commissioned by mid-
1991. Equipment and furniture procurement for the educational facilities was also efficiently
executed through bulk procurement by the MOE and in some cases, these items were procured
directly by the Government with its own resources. The original allocation for school equipment
and furniture was only partially utilized due to higher appraisal estimates than the actual costs
incurred during implementation. These savings enabled Government to request a reallocation of
funds from the equipment, furniture and teaching materials category of the loan to the civil
works category, as well as an increase in the disbursement percentage for civil works financed
under the loan from 42 percent to 59 percent which the Bank approved.
9.     Implementation of the TA was delayed due to its restructuring and contract execution
(negotiations and signing). Its implementation phase was also delayed because of the lack of
coordination of the wide range of short-term experts. Nevertheless, the subprojects which were
designed under the restructured TA program responded to the needs of Oman, particularly the
educational planning and the educational TV program of training.
10.    To  summarize  the  above-noted  achievements, the  project was successful in  its
institutional development and physical objectives, as well as in providing improved access to
schooling for girls and the poor (Table 1, Part II refers).

D. Implementation Record
11.   General Overview. The project was well implemented by the Borrower and with the
exception of the technical assistance component, was completed two years ahead of schedule
(civil works and equipment/furniture procurement). As a result of the full use of the facilities,
the project has met its objectives by contributing to improved access, particularly for girls.
Specific details on project activities are provided below:
(a)   Civil Works.  Having gained the experience of the First and Second
Education projects, the MOE Department of Projects was well prepared to
implement the school building program scheduled under the project (three
teacher training institutes; five secondary schools; and thirty primary
schools). Construction was expedited efficiently, within project appraisal
specifications and executed ahead of time (Part II, Table 5 refers). Most
of the schools have had classes added (in the case of primary schools, the
figure is double the original allocation in most instances) to accommodate
the increase in enrollments at every level. These additions have been
financed by the Government.
(b)   Equipment, Furniture and Teaching Materials Procurement.   This
component was also carried out ahead of schedule and substantially below
appraisal estimates. Original price estimates were based on market rates
which were reduced dramatically when many foreign agents set up
business in Oman, after the project began. Estimates also did not take into
account Govern-ment bulk procurement methods.
(c)   Compliance with Loan Covenants. All legal covenants were fulfilled,
namely: (i) the appointment of trained Omani principals to primary
schools; (ii) staffing levels in key MOE departments to be maintained with
appropriate support; and (iii) opening and maintenance of a special
account. The account, as well as project expenditures were also audited
annually and these reports were provided to the Bank on time.
(d)   Technical Assistance. Annex 2 provides a comprehensive report on the
TA program. It was prepared in collaboration with MOE staff and data
obtained over several Bank supervision missions. A final evaluation of the
TA program was not available from UNESCO. After the TA contract
between the Government and UNESCO was signed, a component to
develop training programs for headteachers and school supervisors was
added. The TA package included (i) an educational planning component;
(ii) a training program for headteachers and school supervisors; (iii) an
educational technology component; and (iv) a component to improve the



- 6 -
technical capabilities of the MOE's Curriculum Development Department.
With the exception of (iv) above, where two subprojects (subprojects 3
and 4 - see page 28) were dropped because the experts considered that
they were quite complex and would cost more than the budget allocated,
all other programs were completed satisfactorily, albeit with some delay.
Delays occurred because the scheduling of consultant services to carry out
specific program actions was not consistent with the TA implementation
plan agreed during contract formulation. It was also difficult to keep track
of projected expenditures for program components. In the absence of firm
action plan targets and a late start up of the TA program, this component
took almost three years longer than the other project components and
activities.
(e)   A Program of Maintenance. Under the originally-designed institutional
development component of the project, it was envisaged that twelve staff-
months of specialists services would be utilized to establish in cooperation
with the MOE Projects Department, procedures for regular building
maintenance; the development of a facilities inventory; management
manuals; service handbooks; and related staff training. The Bank loan did
not fund the proposed maintenance program as all TA funds were
allocated to a revised TA program. Nevertheless, it was established that
there was a routine and thorough program for school maintenance in
existence, carried out by the Projects Department.
12.   Project Costs. The under-run in overall costs (Part H, Table 8A refers) resulted from
bulk methods of procurement for equipment, furniture and teaching materials which were
overestimated at appraisal. Additional funds were allocated to the civil works category and paid
for a higher share of Bank financing for construction (originally financed at 42 percent and
amended to 59 percent). Of the original US$1.9 million contract for project TA, only US$0.75
million was paid directly to UNESCO. Government decided to procure remaining equipment for
the TA program on its own, instead of through UNESCO procurement services, thereby
reducing the cost of procurement. Also, two of the subprojects on the TA component were not
completed. Project costs were very efficiently monitored by the Ministry of Finance and
Economy staff responsible for the project's administration (Borrower's Report - Annex 3 refers).
E. Project Sustainability
13.   The project is likely to maintain and exceed its developmental objectives, particularly in
the area of school enrollments and the improved quality of teaching. Most importantly, the
Government's goal of Omanization of the teaching force has brought about a steady increase in
the number of school teachers, headmasters and administrators who are Omani nationals. The
Government continues to be committed to improving human resources development and has



- 7 -
increased its expenditure on the education sector as a percentage of total expenditures from 7.6
percent in 1985 to 9.0 percent in 1990. Government's total expenditure (current and capital) on
education rose from RO 147.6 million in 1989 to RO 180.2 million in 1991 (about US$470
million). Recurrent expenditures for the operation of project facilities, including maintenance,
are being covered adequately by the Government.
F. Bank Performance
14.   The Bank's performance was satisfactory during the project design and implementation
phases. Bank staff assisted the Borrower in restructuring the technical assistance component; in
amending the loan to increase the disbursement percentage for civil works; and in reallocating
loan proceeds to redistribute funds between loan categories at the request of the Borrower. Bank
staff were unsuccessful, nevertheless, in speeding up implementation of the TA component
although considerable effort was made to obtain regular progress reports on ongoing programs.
UNESCO staff did inform the Bank that these progress reports were to be provided through the
Government and not directly to the Bank.  The reports received by the Bank provided
information only on the current status of its financial expenditures on the program. The Bank
did try to improve the process of reporting, as well as the timely coordination of the TA
activities and use of experts, through the resident UNDP representative. However, this office
was closed in 1992 and local coordination and monitoring of the experts continued to be
problematic.
G. Borrower Performance
15.   The Borrower's performance was generally very good. MOE staff responsible for the
school building programs executed their activities efficiently with substantial developmental
results. The Ministry of Finance & Economy (MOFE) staff responsible for monitoring and
reporting on project financial records prepared regular reports which were thorough and accurate
(Borrower's Report - Annex 3, refers). MOFE staff efforts also facilitated improved preparation
of audit reports (through the use of private auditors).  Loan covenants were completed
expeditiously. Project-financed schools and colleges were built within budget in less than the
estimated time (see Part II, Table 5) and procurement was executed efficiently (paras 8 & 11 [b]).
16.   The Borrower's effectiveness in managing the TA program  was hampered by the
component's slow implementation. This was due mainly to poor reporting and communication
which could have improved if Government could have devised (i) a method of ensuring regular
communication with the agency on the TA programs; (ii) the agency's preparation of timely
progress reports for ongoing subproject components; and (iii) firm action plans for completing
proposed programs. Instead, information was diffused through the MOFE, the MOE and the
Government's representative at UNESCO.



17.   Borrower reporting on other components of the project was detailed, consistent and of
excellent quality (see attachments contained in the Borrower's Contribution to the ICR - Annex
3). Bank missions were provided with requested data promptly which greatly facilitated the
Bank's review of the project during its implementation phase.
H. Assessment of Outcome
18.   The project was well executed and the impact of its developmental objectives has been
substantial. The educational facilities constructed have contributed in meeting the large
enrollment needs of the country. Actually, the need was so large that double shifting had to be
resorted to. Additional investments in primary school construction to meet current needs and to
alleviate double shifting is warranted. Special attention should be paid to the appointment of
Omani nationals to staffing positions to further reduce the number of expatriate teaching staff at
project-financed schools. The country is 'graduated' from Bank lending, and no follow up
operation is anticipated. Although there were delays in implementing the TA program, it was
successful in most of its components and a locally produced film on the origin of water and its
relevance to life recently won first prize in the Gulf States competition for educational TV
programs. The Curriculum Development Department who produced the film, benefitted from
equipment and training financed under the TA program.
I. Future Qperation
19.   In order to meet the enrollment needs, the Government has resorted to double shifting
and construction of additional classrooms in most of the country's schools. Special attention
should be given to the appointment of a sufficient number of Omani nationals to staffing
positions at project-financed schools. Since the country has 'graduated' from Bank lending, no
follow up operation is currently expected.
20.   An Operations Evaluation Department (OED) impact evaluation of this project, along
with the Second Education Project (Project Completion Report No.12498, dated November 17,
1993), would be useful in the near future, to assist the Borrower in reviewing the developmental
achievements of the Second and Third Education projects (Loans 2419-OMA and 2799-OMA),
against the current (Fourth) five-year plan's recommendations and goals for the sector.
J. Key Lessons Learned
21.   Although the MOE's assessment of TA provided is favorable, its delayed execution
indicated that:



- 9 -
(a)   local capacity to adequately select, manage and monitor experts who implement
TA programs was overestimated;
(b)   responsibility for implementation should be lodged in a single unit within the
MOE. This was not the case in this project resulting in weak coordination and
monitoring of TA; and
(c)   the TA recipient must ensure that there is adequate reporting by the TA provider
who is held accountable for delivering the product according to firm schedules.

THE SULTANATE OF OMAN
THE THIRD EDUCATION PROJECT
(LOAN 2799-OMA)
THE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT MISSION
MARCH 23-30, 1995
AIDE-MEMOIRE
Introduction
1.    An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) mission composed of Ms. Patricia
Maughan, Operations Officer (MN2HR), and Dr. Azzedine Akesbi (Consultant, Vocational
Training Specialist), visited the Sultanate from March 23 through 30, 1995 to prepare the ICR
for the subject loan which closed on December 31, 1994. Ms. Maughan prepared the draft
report after confirming the status of project components and objectives, while Dr. Akesbi
undertook an in-depth review of the UNESCO managed institutional development program
financed under the loan.
2.    The mission wishes to express its appreciation for the consistent support and cooperation
received from the responsible Government departments, and in particular from the staff of the
Ministry of Finance and Economy (MOFE) who implemented the financial and administrative
activities under the project. Specifically, staff of both the MOFE and the Ministry of Education
(MOE) participated in the ICR mission and provided the mission with the relevant financial
status reports and other documents/statistics which greatly facilitated the mission's review of the
project's implementation phase.
Mission Activities
3.    The Bank mission assessed: (i) the degree of achievement of project objectives; (ii)
prospects for the project's sustainability; (iii) Bank and Borrower Performance; (iv) project
outcome; and (v) the plan for the project's future operation. The mission undertook a field trip
to three of the institutions (two secondary schools and a teacher training college) financed under
the project. The mission met with staff of the schools and toured the facilities. Information on
enrollment statistics and number of classes (original and additions), were verified by the mission
at the project sites visited, vis a vis MOE data provided for the ICR. The mission also guided
the Borrower (MOFE) personnel in preparing the Government's report - 'The Borrower's
Contribution to the ICR'.



- 22 -
Prqject Status
4.    The loan was closed on December 31, 1994 - the original project closing date. The
project's development objectives were exceeded and its implementation experience has been rated
as 'satisfactory'.   All project-financed institutions were constructed (three teacher training
colleges, five secondary schools and thirty primary schools), almost three years ahead of
implementation targets. Efficient procurement of equipment and furniture through the bulk
procurement method resulted in project cost savings which were reallocated to the civil works
category of the loan. The reallocation provided additional financing for civil works for which an
increase in the percentage disbursed by the Bank (from 42 percent to 59 percent) had been
agreed.  Borrower compliance with loan covenants was achieved, and progress and audit
reporting up to date and of excellent quality.
Agreements Reached
5.    It was agreed that:
(a)    The project's audit report for the period ending December 31, 1994 would
be transmitted to the Bank by June 30, 1995;
(b)   Incomplete statistical data on enrollments and graduates for project-
financed institutions would be transmitted to the Bank by April 10, 1995;
(c)    UNESCO would be requested to prepare an 'end of project' report on the
status and implementation experience of the programs it provided under
the institutional development contract with the Government, financed
under the loan;
(d)   With specific regard to the project's future operation, as no future project
is anticipated in view of Oman's 'graduated' status, the mission stressed
the need for continued monitoring of the very high enrollments at all
education levels to ensure that quality is maintained: and
(e)    The Borrower's Contribution to the ICR  would be finalized and
transmitted to the Bank by mid-April 1995.

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETION REPORT
REPORT ON THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM
FINANCED UNDER THE SECOND AND THIRD EDUCATION PROJECTS
(LOANS 2419 AND 2799-OMA)
A. INTRODUCTION
1.    The Second (Ln. 2419) and Third Education (Ln. 2799) projects both had technical
assistance components, which were combined under a UNESCO-managed program for which a
contract, in the amount of $1.906 million, was signed with the Government in October 1989.
This combined program had three components: (i) curriculum development in technical
education; (ii) educational technology; and (iii) educational planning.  In June 1991 the
educational technology component was dropped, and in its place, a component for developing
training programs for head teachers and school supervisors was added.
B. IMPLEMENTATION OVERVIEW
2.    Completion of the TA program  lengthened the implementation phase of the Third
Education project by more than three years to 1994 (the establishment of project facilities was
completed in 1991). The work was delayed because: (i) Government changed priorities and
wanted a redesign of the TA; (ii) contracting arrangements with UNESCO took time to arrange;
and (iii) implementation of the programs was not well coordinated.  However, all of the
programs had satisfactory results. Some equipment needs for one of the components (improving
the technical capabilities of the MOE's Curriculum  Development Department) were not
completed; and two of the subprojects for this Department were dropped as they were considered
to be too complex to implement. On completion of the program, UNESCO had utilized $0.75
million of Ln.2799 financing for the completed components.
3.    The Borrower's management of the TA program was hampered by inadequate reporting
and follow up of consultants' visits by the agency. This situation could have improved if
Government had: (i) maintained a single source of communication on the TA programs; (ii)
insisted on being provided with progress reports on time; and (iii) completed an action plan
agreed with UNESCO. Instead there were several channels of communication with the agency
(including the MOFE, the MOE and the Government's representative at UNESCO), and MOE
did not demand an adequate level of performance from the agency.

C. COMPONENTS OF THE REVISED TA PROGRAM
Cl. The Educational Planning Component
Content and Results
4. This component was to be implemented with the Departments of Higher Education and Training, and
of Personnel and Educational Planning of the Ministry of Education (MOE). The general objective of the
component was to improve the working practices of the personnel involved in educational planning, in
formulating educational development plans and in the use of school-mapping techniques. The training
activities were implemented as follows:
(a)   A one-week course (June 23-27, 1990) in models and techniques of educational planning was
conducted with 21 staff of the MOE. During the course, five staff were nominated to be
prepared and trained as a national team and to be future trainers;
(b)   A one-week workshop for the national team on school-mapping was conducted from
November 3-7, 1990;
(c)   A two-week school mapping workshop was conducted (December 8-19, 1990) with 23
education planners from the ministry and regional offices. Visits were made to four regions
to explain and supervise the organization of the data for the proposed school mapping
exercise; and
(d)   Senior staff from the MOE made study tours to Britain, France and Jordan to learn
education planning.
5. Evaluations from MOE staff who participated in the program found that it was very useful in
developing local capacity for education planning and in particular, school mapping procedures and
preparation.
C2. The Training Program for Head teachers and School Supervisors.
Content and Results
6. The objectives of this component were to:
(a)   Develop and organize two in-service training programs, one for School Supervisors
(SS) and the other for Head teachers (HT). Specifically, this component would
evaluate, design, plan and organize SS and HT programs;
(b)   Improve local capacity for organizing and executing these programs;



- 26 -
(c)    Train a group of trainers: two senior officials of MOE and five future trainers;
(d)   Provide seven intermediate teacher training colleges (ITTC) with necessary educational
equipment; and a micro-teaching lab;
(e)    Prepare, produce and distribute a manual guide for trainees;
(f)    Organize and implement a program of continuous training (refresher courses).
The component was executed in eight phases as follows:
-     evaluation of the previous training programs for SSs and HTs;
-     analysis of the Omani SS and HT tasks and responsibilities;
-     approval and adoption of tasks and competencies;
-     building the new program;
-     setting forward plans;
-     preparation of criteria; and
-     preparation of selection tests
7.  In-service training for head teachers started in 1977 and in 1982 for school supervisors. These
programs needed updating because they were no longer comprehensive, and course content was no longer
well integrated.  The rapid development of the educational system as well as social changes, also
underscored the need to revise the training programs for SSs and HTs.
8. All activities proposed for the component were implemented. Two senior staff made a two-week
study visit to the British Open University and the Moroccan Institute of Training (October 1992). Also, a
team of five future trainers made a five-week study visit to Morocco (June, 1993). A total of 115 types of
materials relevant to the program were developed. ITTCs were provided with books and reference guides
required for study activities and research. Libraries of seven ITTCs received 330 books (20 copies each).
At the end of the first year of the component's implementation, 21 SSs and 69 HTs completed the
program successfully. One deficiency was in the training of trainers as there were delays in selecting the
five future trainers. This contributed to gaps in their orientation and on-the-job training.
C3. The Curriculum Department Development Component
Content and Results
9. This component originally included four sub-projects, but only two [(a) and (b) below] were
completed. Original subprojects were:
(a)    Development of the technical and productive capacities of the department in the area of
educational television;



- 27 -
(b)   Development and work innovation of the printing and silk-screen division;
(c)   Improvement and innovation of drawing, photography and printing methods through the use
of computers; and
(d)   Equipment and production development at the educational materials production workshop.
10. The component experienced delays.  During the last year of the Third Education Project's
implementation phase, the first two subprojects were completed successfully. Their outcomes were as
follows.
Subproject 1: Development of technical and productive capacities of educational television at
the Department of Curriculmn Development.
Training of educational TV staff started during the implementation phase of the Second Education
project (Ln.2419). Six persons were trained in this area. The first phase consisted of consultant
TA and assessment of unit equipment needs. An expert stayed in Oman for one month to assist
the unit in preparing equipment specifications. During the last phase, the new equipment was
bought and installed. The company that installed the material trained the Department's staff for
its use. The educational TV unit is now able to produce good quality broadcasting films. The
old equipment is also used as it is compatible with the new acquisitions. The World Bank's
Completion mission visited the educational TV studio at the Department of Curriculum
Development and viewed samples of films. One of them - Water: A Source of Life - won first
prize at the Gulf States competition for educational TV programs. The Curriculum Development
unit is able to produce high quality, professional films, is technically independent and able to
perform all operations on its own; and is producing films for Grades I to 12) in different subjects
(Arabic, social studies, science studies). In addition, this unit is now responsible for information
and school counselling needs.
Subproject 2: Development of the Printing and Silk-Screen Division.
There were initial difficulties related to equipment procurement for this subproject because of
disagreement on equipment requirements between the Department of Curriculum Development
and UNESCO. The MOE was authorized to procure the equipment on its own. The subproject
was completed: machines and equipment were installed and staff received necessary training for
new equipment. The new equipment is operated by a foreign technician and two Omanis. This
component is working in a satisfactory manner.



- 28 -
Dropped subprojects.
As previously noted two subprojects were not implemented - the improvement and
innovation of drawing, photography and printing by means of computers (Subproject 3);
and equipment for a workshop to produce educational materials (Subproject 4). UNESCO
experts determined that they would cost more than the allocated budget. The Department
requested cancellation of both subprojects and suggested they be replaced by a
computerized textbook subproject to develop expertise and procure equipment to produce
and update textbooks by computer. The Third Education Project closed before this plan
could be initiated.
D. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
11.   Two of the three revised TA components were completed successfully, as were two of the four
parts of the third component. The Borrower was largely satisfied by the outcome. The MOE's
assessment of TA provided through the implementation of the components described above is generally
favorable. MOE officials are satisfied that consultants' contribution in the areas of educational planning,
educational TA, and HT and SS training has been useful and well appreciated by concerned staff. The
components of the revised TA program have facilitated an improvement in training and technical capacity
of Omanis.
12.   The weakness of the implementation of the TA components were the long redesign time; the time
it took to complete arrangements with UNESCO; and the limited management of the expert services. The
MOE experienced some difficulty in its communication with the agency relative to the scheduling of
consultant visits; and their reporting and follow up after missions.  In a few cases, background
information on consultants was insufficient and inadequate. This adversely affected the outcome of their
missions. For example, some experts were not specialized enough to be useful for the Department of
Curriculum  Development.  There was also a problem of delay or the non-delivery of equipment
(subprojects for the Curriculum Department and HTs and SSs components). These problems could have
been minimized by the: a) early appointment of a project coordinator for TA at the MOE and in
UNESCO, both with sole responsibility for the TA; b) earlier involvement of the relevant MOE
departments and units in preliminary planning and definition of consultant terms of references and
selection; and c) regular reporting against action plans by the agency.

The project as a whole has been successfully implemented as planned.
The revised plan was mostly due to the increase in the civil works
increased percentage of financing. Some savings have been refunded to
the W.Torld Bank.
The Bank supervisions on the project have contributed in the success of
the utilization of the loan and also as a guidance on the terms of the
condition of the agreement. The Bank missions worked closely with the
Ministry of Finance & Economy and also with the Ministry of Education,
inplementing agent for the project. The close relation maintained by the
mission and the Bank as a whole will continue to be valued with
appreciation.
Education 1 and 2 have provided experience in the execution of World
Bank Loan No: 2799-OM with success.
