1. THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Contribution to the Economy
1.01      Since the early 1960s, the industrial sector, and maore specifically
manufacturing,/l has been the engine of growth of the Korean economy. Over
the period 1974-78, the manufacturing sector has grown at an average of 17.5%
p.a. in real terms compared to an average 11% growth of aggregate GNP. In
1979, the growth rate of the manufacturing sector slowed to 9.8%, still
higher than the 6.4% growth of real GNP. The share of manufacturing in total
GNP has increased from 25.2% in 1974 to 32.7% in 1979 while that of agricul-
ture dropped from 25.4% to 19.2%. In 1979, seasonally adjusted manufacturing
employment reached 3.1 million and accounted for 22.9% of the total employed
population compared to 15.9% in 1973. Over the five-year period 1975-79,
approximately 1.1 million jobs have been created in the manufacturing sector;
this represented 53.6% of total net employment creation during that period.
1.02      Korea's success in economic development is largely based on a
strategy of export promotion with emphasis on manufactured exports. Manu-
factured products, which accounted for about 52% of total exports in 1964,
have gradually increased their share and have remained at about 90% since
1976. Gradual changes have taken place in the structure of manufactured
exports over the past three years: light manufactured products including
textiles have declined in relative terms from 52.7% of total exports in 1977
to 50.4% in 1979; heavy industry products have increased their share from
32.8% in 1977 to 38.6% in 1979. However, some of Korea's traditional light
exports such as footwear and clothing have remained buoyant. The changing
composition of Korean exports reflects the significant changes which have
taken place in recent years in the structure of the manufacturing sector.
1.03      It is estimated that export expansion contributed about 35% of the
growth in manufacturing output over the period 1975-77 against 74% for
domestic demand. Between 1972 and 1976, exports grew in real terms at
32.7% but slowed to 15.8% in 1977-78. In 1979, the nominal value of exports
reached $15.1 billion, 18.4% higher than in 1978; however, in volume terms
it represented a 0.9% decline over 1978. This was the result of high
domestic demand which diverted goods from export markets and the effect of
inflationary pressures on the competitiveness of Korean products. The
growth rate of 16.3% in 1980, which pushed exports to $17.5 billion was
still relatively sluggish by Korean standards but some acceleration is
expected in 1981 as a result of the 35% depreciation of the won (during
1980) and the anticipated upswing in world business activity.
/1 In 1979, manufacturing alone accounted for 96% (in 1975 prices) of total
value added in the industrial sector (i.e. mining and manufacturing).

1.05      The composition of manufacturing shows a marked shift in favor of
heavy industry whose share of total manufacturing value added exceeded 50% for
the first time in 1978. The most significant gains have been registered by
the machinery sector. The rate of growth of chemical industries, however,
lagged behind so that the sector declined from about 30% in 1970 to 22.5% in
1978. Light industries have declined steadily since 1970, with sharpest
drop being recorded in the food, beverage and tobacco sector. Textiles,
meanwhile, have maintained their 16-17% share of total manufacturing value
added. These changes in the structure of manufacturing reflect a deliberate



- 3 -
policy to shift production gradually from Korea's traditional light
industrial production towards more skill- and technology-intensive types of
production.
Geographic Distribution
1.06      The 1975 population census showed that approximately 27% of the
population of Korea lived in the cities of Seoul and Pusan; the province of
North Gyeongsang in which Taegu, the third largest industrial city is located,
accounted for another 14%. The following table shows that the regional
distribution of manufacturing enterprises and employment is skewed in favor of
Seoul and Pusan.

While Seoul and Pusan remain the largest industrial centers, marginal improve-
ments have taken place between 1974 and 1977 in the redistribution of indus-
trial employment outside these areas. This may be the first sign that
government polic:ies aimed at a better distribution of employment are having an
impact. The efforts being made to reduce congestion in Seoul and Pusan
include severe restrictions on industrial expansion in these two cities, a
program of financial assistance for the relocation of industries, the
promotion of new industrial estates such as the Pohang, Ulsan and Yeosu
complexes and the Saemaeul Movement, initiated in 1971, for creating off-farm
employment in rural areas.
Factor Use and Efficiency
1.07      The main elements which have contributed to the rapid expansion of
the manufacturing sector are (a) a high rate of investment and (b) efficiency
in factor use, both capital and labor. Manufacturing investment increased



- 4 -
by a phenomenal 63.4% in real terms in 1978 and a further 17.4% in 1979. As
a share of total fixed investment, manufacturing reached 38% in 1979 compared
to an average of 21.9% over the period 1975-77. Within manufacturing, a
major part of investment was directed towards fulfilling ambitious government
targets for heavy industry. Heavy industry accounted for 78.9% of total
manufacturing investment in 1977-79. Investment in light industry accounted
for the remaining 21.1% and lagged significantly behind the Fourth Plan
targets. Efficiency in factor use has also contributed to the high
performance of the Korean manufacturing sector. Calculations of incremental
capital to output ratios (ICORs) with a one-year lag show a gradual decline
over the three consecutive periods 1961-66, 1966-71 and 1971-75, indicating
that the use of capital had become more efficient. Since 1976 the increase in
the share of heavy and chemical industries has led to a reversal of this trend
but the increase has been large only in the past two years with the economic
recession being the main culprit.
Industrial Policies
1.08      The phenomenal growth of the manufacturing sector was, to a large
extent, made possible by efficient and pragmatic government policies.
Incentive packages have been developed and adjusted over time to fit evolving
priorities for industrial development. With variable emphasis, policies have
aimed at the promotion of export industries, import substitution, assistance
to small and medium enterprises, geographic dispersal of industry and in the
last few years, promotion of skill-intensive sectors with a higher technolo-
gical content. Export promotion has been the major objective since the
early sixties. Subsidies on exports have continued to increase in absolute
terms over the period 1975-78 but were insufficient to compensate for the
loss of competitiveness induced by Korea's higher prices relative to its
major trading partners. As a result, the real effective exchange rate
deteriorated sharply for Korean exporters over that period. The 19% devalua-
tion of the Won in January 1980 and a further 16% decline in the remainder of
that year has appreciably improved the situation and should serve to spur
exports.
Sector Issues
1.09      Korea-s economy began to show definite signs of overheating in
1978. Manufacturing investment, which had been increasing at a rate of 13.3%
in real terms over 1975-77, accelerated sharply to 63.4% in 1978. With
hindsight, it appears that the growth of manufacturing investment was too
rapid and was excessively concentrated in capital-intensive industries (such
as heavy machinery and petrochemicals) resulting in a sharp rise in capital-
intensity of output as well as increased inflationary pressures in 1978-79.
Indications are that investment in heavy industry has exceeded, in some
instances, the levels dictated by market size, financing capacity and
technical capability. Overinvestment is now apparent in some branches of



- 5 -
heavy industry and real wage increases have outstripped productivity gains
since Hhe mid-seventies thus causing an erosion of Korea's comparative
advantage in labor-intensive manufactured exports.
1.10      The financial system has played a crucial role in Korea by
providing the financial support necessary to implement the Government's
economic development strategy. For instance, the operation of the export
credit system under government control has been a vital ingredient of the
phenomenal export growth which has spurred the expansion of the economy since
the mid-1960s. The Government has effectively used the financial system
as a tool to implement its investment decisions in both the public and
private sectors. The financial system remains characterized by a high degree
of subservience to government directives and acts as a channel of subsidized
finance for preidentified priority activities. The substantial degree of
government control and the large recourse to "subsidized directed lending"
have contributed towards the creation of one of the major problems with which
Korea is now faced with, namely overinvestment in certain segments of the
manufacturing sector. The main instrument used by the Government to effect
the transfer of resources towards the development of heavy manufacturing and
chemical industries was the National Investment Fund. Similar government
sponsored funding programs have been established to finance other industrial
priority areas such as machinery industries, small and medium industries,
etc. The Government lias recognized that this system of "subsidized/directed"
lending has led to suboptimal allocation of funds and has constrained the
overall efficiency of the financial system.
1.11      The Government has begun to formulate a structural adjustment
program aimed at enabling the industrial sector to continue in its role as
the major source of growth.  Structural adjustments include a comprehensive
reform of the financial system with emphasis on a liberalization of the
operations of intermediaries, particularly the commercial banks, plans to
rationalize the structure of heavy industry by encouraging mergers of the
firms involved, and a re-examination of the incentive system. The Bank has
been consulted on this effort and has under review the Government's request
for a structural adjustment loan. The financial sector reform has also been
discussed with the Bank in the context of two recent lending operations to the
Korea Development Bank and the Korea Long-Term Credit Bank. A package of
specific policy measures has been agreed upon in connection with these two
projects which aLims at improving the efficiency of the financial system and
its responsiveness to the increasing complexity and sophistication of the
Korean economy.
Recent Performance and Short-Term Prospects
1.12      After averaging a growth rate of nearly 11% during 1977-70, the
Korean economy entered a downswing in 1979. The real growth rate slowed to
6.4% in that year and then plummetted to -5.7% in 1980. Over-expansion



-6 -
of the economy in 1976-78, stagnation of exports, the resource transfer
arising from oil price hikes, and the measures taken to restrain inflation
are some of the reasons behind the recession, with a severe harvest failure
accounting for the steepness of the fall in 1980.
1.13      The most recent projections made by the Government call for GNP
growth rates of 5-6% in 1981 and 7-8% in 1982, much of which will be the
outcome of an expansion in industrial output. Fixed capital investment
is expected to rise by 4% in 1981 and a further 8.3% in 1982. At the same
time, some restructuring of the economy, particularly in the industrial
sector, seems desirable to improve efficiency. Korea's shift from labor-
intensive towards skill-intensive industries ought to be pursued but
investments in heavy industry need to be carefully reviewed and rationalized
to avoid overinvestment and excess productive capacity.
2. THE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY SECTOR
A. Sector Profile
2.01      Definition.  The Small and Medium Industry (SMI) sector is defined
in a number of laws and government decrees in terms of either total assets or
employment size as follows:
Total assets    Number of
(W million)    employees
Mining, manufacturing,
transportation                   Up to 500      Up to 300
Construction                       Up to 500      Up to 50
Commerce and services              Up to 50       UJp to 20
The purpose of the definition is mainly to differentiate between the
clientele of the various government-owned development finance institutions./
/1 For some specific industrial activities, the Government in 1979 has
enlarged the definition of SMIs to include manufacturing enterprises
with up to 500 employees (para. 3.08).



-7-
The Role of SMIs
2.02      The role of the SMI sector remains substantial, although declining
steadily since the mid-sixties in terms of its relative contribution to the
economy as a result of Korea-s rapid industrialization (Annex A, Table 1).
In 1978, there were over 30,000 enterprises in the SMI sector accounting for
96.5% of all manufacturing establishments, 47.8% of manufacturing employment
and 34.3% of value added. The share of SMIs in total manufacturing output
and value added has stabilized since the mid-seventies at a little over 30%;
employment has marginally increased from 46% in 1975 to 48% in 1978. The
export performance of the sector is quite remarkable, accounting directly or
indirectly for over 40% of Korea-s total manufactured exports in the period
1976-78, which was substantially in excess of its share of value added and
output.
2.03      Aggregate figures tend to hide the declining role of smaller enter-
prises within the SMI sector. The number of enterprises with less than 200
employees has declined from 98% of all manufacturing establishments in 1968
to 94% in 1977. The percentage of labor employed by these smaller firms has
also declined from 54% to 38%, value added and output from 36% to 24%. This
trend reflects the decreasing competitiveness of smaller enterprises while
medium sized enterprises have been able to maintain their competitive edge
in a changing economic environment. For the SMI sector as a whole, and
despite some stabilization in the economic importance of the sector in the
seventies, the general trend may be towards a slowdown in the growth of
output of the SMI sector relative to total industrial production, as
indicated below:
1975      1977       1979     1980
Total production           100      155.6     213.5       209
SMI production             100      144.1     193.8       170
This downward trend is the natural result of Korea's rapid industrial
development process and of changes in the comparative advantage of SMIs.
Industrial Structure of the SMI Sector
2.04      The SMI sector has played a prominent role in the process of
industrialization in Korea. In the 1960s, industrial development was based
on labor-intensive production techniques and SMIs dominated the light
manufacturing sector, particularly activities involving simple assembly,
mixing and finishing. The broadening of markets resulting from Korea's



success in export promotion later allowed small manufacturers to expand
operations by taking advantage of scale economies. The emergence of large
scale producers of light manufactures has reduced the share of SMIs in
light industries. At the same time, SMIs have diversified their operations
into "heavy" industry, particularly in the machinery and metal working
subsectors.  The following table shows the structure of the manufacturing
sector in 1977.

Total                15,438      4,717   30.6        5,596      1,813  32.4
While food products, textiles and clothing are still dominant in SMI produc-
tion, the importance of machinery and chemicals has grown steadily.
Factor Costs and Competitiveness of SMIs
2.05      The gradual shift of the SMI sector away from light manufacturing
has been reinforced by government policies designed to expedite the
restructuring of industry in the face of changing factor costs, comparative
advantage, and international market opportunities. With rising labor costs



-9 -
at home and the increasing competitiveness of the export market, the
Government has placed a heavy emphasis on the growth of large scale
manufacturing and on broadening the product mix to include such capital and
skill intensive items as consumer durables, machinery, heavy chemicals and
automobiles. Further, Korean producers have found that price has ceased to
be the sole arbiter of domestic and export markets.  The ambit of
competition has come to embrace such factors as product quality, delivery
schedules, credit to customers, marketing and technology, which are areas
where larger firms usually have an inherent advantage.
2.06       In its efforts to build up heavy industry and raise the produc-
tivity and technological levels of major producers, the Government was
responsible for diminishing the flow of resources to the SMI sector in the
late 1970s. This retarded somewhat the pace of modernization in the SMI
sector and led to a widening of the factor productivity gap between large
and small firms. In addition, the rapid development of new technologies
increased the demand for skilled labor throughout industry and has led to
labor shortages in 1978-79. Labor turnover and wage levels increased in the
SMI sector as workers sought employment in larger enterprises. In fact, the
wage index of SMIs has outpaced that of large industry; in 1979, average
wage levels in the SMI sector were 76% of large industry wages compared to
65% in the late 1960s. Labor productivity in small industry was, however,
much lower, reaching only 56% of productivity in large industry, thus eroding
fuLrther the profitability of SMIs. Similarly, investment in the SMI sector
which hal risen from 20% of manufacturing fixed investment in 1975 to 27% in
1977, lagged behind in the following years. Investment in light industry,
although not directly comparable to SMI investment, which accounted for 40%
of total manufacturing investment over the period 1972-79 and was expected
to decline to 36% over the Fourth Plan period (1977-81), lagged behind Plan
targets. Over the period 1977-79, it accounted for only 20% of total
manufacturing fixed investment. Higher allocations of investment to light
irndustry and SMI might have helped to improve quality of production and to
maintain competitiveness.
2.07       Rising production costs induced by higher wage levels in industry
and less than optimal investment levels may, in part, be responsible for the
recent slowdown in the growth of Korea's light manufactured exports and the
declining share of SMIs in total manufactured exports from 40.5% in 1978 to
38.9% in 1979 and 34.6% in the first eight months of 1980.
Government Policies in Support of the SMI Sector
2.08       The Government launched its program for promoting SMIs in the
early 1960s with the establishment of the Small and Medium Industry Bank
(SMIB) and a Small Industry Division in the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry (MCI).  The Government initially confined its efforts to the
provision of financial and technical assistance through SMIB. In the later



- 10 -
half of the 1960s, SMI support policies became more selective. Emphasis was
placed on the promotion, through preferential credit and technical guidance,
of export oriented SMIs. The Government also encouraged joint purchases of
inputs and marketing under cooperative arrangements and vertical linkages
between large industries and SMIs. These policy objectives remained largely
unchanged in the first half of the 1970s with greater weight attached to
the promotion of "Saemaul factories"/l providing off-farm employment in
rural areas.
2.09      Current Policy Objectives.  SMI sector priorities for the Fourth
Plan period (1977-81) were formulated in the context of the broader
objective of industrial diversification into more capital and technology
intensive activities. While the traditional role of SMIs in employment
creation and dispersal of industry continued to be emphasized, priority areas
were identified as (a) promotion of vertical linkages with large industry;
(b) modernization of production facilities through capital investment and
business mergers; (c) increased support of activities with favorable growth
prospects (e.g. machinery industry); and (d) inducement of technical
innovation and productivity improvement. The increasing selectivity of
government policies in the SMI sector was expected to translate into the
identification of target industrial groups, the design of a development plan
for each industrial group selected, and finally, the selection within the
target groups of individual enterprises eligible for intensified financial
and technical assistance.
2.10      In practice, the designation by the Government of specific branches
of the SMI sector to be promoted has not always proceeded on the basis of a
good evaluation of the growth potential and comparative advantage of the
target groups. This shortcoming inherent in the system of directed lending
is being addressed by the Governmnent in the context of the financial sector
reform. Attempts at greater selectivity have also been accompanied by
several measures aimed at protecting the SMI sector as a whole from
competition by large industry through the designation of so-called
"intrinsically small" activities /2 which larger enterprises could not enter
and through the enforcement of compulsory subcontracting arrangements./3
These contradictory objectives have substantially reduced the efficiency of
government policies in the SMI sector.
/1 The Saemaul or New Community movement was launched in 1971.
/2  Intrinsically small-scale activities have increased from 23 in 1980 to
36 in 1981.
/3  Items designated for production by SMIs under subcontracting arrange-
ments with large industry have increased fromt 71 in 1980 to 103 in 1981.



- 11 -
2.11      Legal and Institutional Framework.  Over the years, the Government
has established the legal and institutional tools required to enforce its
policy objectives in the SMI sector. The legal instruments include the SMI
Cooperative Act and the SMI Business Coordination Act of 1961, the SMI Basic
Act of 1966, the SMI Affiliation Law /1 of 1975 and the SMI Promotion Law of
1978 whose main objective was the establishment of the SMI Promotion
Corporation. The institutional framework has also expanded rapidly with the
establishment in the early sixties of the Small and Medium Industry Bank
(SMIB) and the Citizens National Bank (CNB). In 1962, the Korea Federation
of Small Business (KFSB) was established to operate as the apex of a network
of provincial and national cooperatives. KFSB has since remained very active
as a representative of SMI interests in government circles. It also provides
a wide range of technical assistance, marketing and procurement services to
its members. The Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF) which also provides
technical assistance to SMIs in addition to its normal financial services
was established as an independent institution in 1976. As the institutional
infrastructure supporting SMIs grew in size and complexity, the Government
realized that the SMI Bureau of MCI could not singlehandedly coordinate the
activities of the various bodies involved. To this end, the SMI Promotion
Law of 1978 provided for the creation of the SMI Promotion Corporation
(SMIPC) which the Government expected ultimately to develop into a powerful
national agency in charge of implementing policies for the development of
the SMI sector.
2.12      The SMI Promotion Corporation.  SMIPC-s major activities cover:
(a) financing the modernization of specific SMI projects in priority sectors
designated by MCI; (b) establishing and financing industrial estates and
common processing facilities for SMIs; (c) improving and coordinating the
delivery of managerial and technological assistance through training and
licensing of extension agents in specialized technical assistance agencies;
and (d) research and publication of statistical information on SMI opera-
tions. SMIPC provides financial support to priority subsectors through its
administration of the SMI Promotion Fund (SMIPF); financial resources are
channelled to eligible borrowers through existing financial institutions,
namely SMIB and CNB. SMIPC has yet to develop its expertise and staff
capability to fulfill its mandate. Its performance record after two years
of operation is not impressive, particularly in the area of extension
services where considerable effort is required to make the system more
responsive to the needs of SMIs. The reorganization of SMI extension
services proposed in para. 2.15 is expected to help improve SMIPC's effi-
ciency and to strengthen its coordinating function.

The total number of extension agents in the nine institutions listed above was
531 in 1979, of which 63% belonged to the Institute of Machinery and Metals,
an institution which provides limited services to the SMI sector. The number
of permanent staff employed by the technical assistance agencies appears to
be small relative to the needs of the SMI sector. These extension agents,
however, are supplemented by about 700 technical "specialists", most of them
college professors and public accountants trained by the SMIPC and hired on
a short-term basis as consultants.
2.14      Considerable effort would be required to improve the qualifications
of extension service officers and to increase the coverage of services. In
1979, on-site visits were organized for only 788 enterprises compared to a
potential clientele of over 30,000 enterprises. The most active agencies
were the SMIPC, KFSB and the Guarantee Fund. SMIB and CNB only provided
limited services. In fact, several of the agencies expected to assist SMI
enterprises are not equipped to do so effectively. This seems to be the case
for the financial institutions whose support on technological matters is
doubtful and whose expertise probably lies in financial and managerial
guidance. For all nine institutions, technical assistance is only a minor
part of their activities and services are limited to a particular segment of
the SET1 sectot, t2cXelt  rietWe.  Faewtat-Loa atxd. au9lcation of efforts
are almost inevitable. Quality of services is also very doubtful and
acceptability of advice is not widespread in the SMI sector.



- 13 -
2.15      It should be recognized that government-sponsored technical
assistance services are only one of several channels for achieving technical
transfers. Machinery suppliers and large industry are equally effective
vehicles for providing and improving technologies. However, in view of the
urgent need to improve productivity and quality of output in the SMI sector,
some strengthening of extension services would be desirable. Because the
quality of these services has been allowed to deteriorate over time,
considerable efforts need to be made by the Government to reorganize the
system of extension services and make it more responsive to the needs of the
SMI sector. During negotiations for the proposed SMIB project, the Govern-
ment finalized with the Bank the terms of reference of a comprehensive study
of extension services to be carried out in the context of an overall study
of the SMI sector sponsored by the Government (Annex A, Appendix 1). Based
on a clear formulation of sectoral objectives and a detailed review of the
present set up, the extension services study would provide recommendations
for a comprehensive program of reorganization of technical assistance to
SMI.  This study would give particular attention to the machinery subsector
in view of its growing importance in Korean industry and in the SMI sector.
Both the SMI sector study and the extension services study are to be
completed by December 31, 1981.
B. Financing the SMI Sector
Financial Structure and Funding Requirements of SMIs
2.16      Annex A, Table 2, provides a comparative analysis of the financial
structures of SMIs and large industries in the seventies. While the asset
structure of SMIs has remained unchanged, their debt and equity structure has
evolved rapidly as shown in the following table:
As of December 31,            1973              1978
(%)              (%)
Liabilities
Short-term                  44.2             56.1
Long-term                   15.6             23.4
Equity                        40.2              20.5
Total                        100.0            100.0



- 14 -
2.17      Given the composition of SMI assets, the mix of short-term and
long-term resources (equity and long-term borrowings) used to finance these
assets was fairly adequate in 1973 with a ratio of about 44:56. Long-term
resources, however, were heavily skewed towards equity financing: long-term
borrowings accounted for only 28% of total long-term funds while a 50% ratio
would have been more appropriate. Although the above figures are cross-
sector averages and there is no such thing as an optimal financial structure,
a more suitable resource mix might have resulted from bringing long-term
borrowings and equity to about 30% each of total assets and keeping short-
term borrowings at about 40%. The heavy reliance of SMI entrepreneurs on
their own equity resources in the early seventies was effectively
constraining their growth potential and was increasing the average cost of
resource mobilization since equity resources, in Korea, are much more
expensive than borrowings. Project sponsors, however, had to rely on their
own resources to finance the acquisition of assets because external sources
of funds were reluctant to provide financial assistance to the high cost and
high risk SMI sector. This effective discrimination was reflected in the
fact that borrowings from banks financed an average of 27% of SMI assets in
1973 compared to 44% for large industry.
2.18      In the mid-seventies, the panoply of government policies in support
of the SMI sector was complemented by a requirement that financial institu-
tions allocate a specific portion of their loans to the SMI sector. At the
same time, subsidized lending programs funded by the Government were stepped
up. These measures largely removed the discrimination against SMI lending
and, by end 1978, bank borrowings had increased to 37% of SMI assets with the
increase being supplied primarily in the form of long-term loans./l Long-term
borrowings have steadily increased over the period 1973-78 from about 16% to
23% of total assets, moving closer to the desirable target of 30%.
2.19      The increased availability of long-term external funds has allowed
a reduction in the excessive reliance of SMIs on equity financing. By end-
1978, however, equity had declined to 20.5% of assets, significantly less
than the notional 30% target. This excessive reduction in equity financing
resulted from a rapid increase in short-term borrowings from 44% to 56% of
total assets in the period 1973-78. Unlike the displacement of equity by
long-term borrowings, this further reduction in equity financing has not had a
positive impact on the aggregate financial structure of the SMI sector. The
1978 aggregate debt/equity ratio of nearly 4:1 was too high, because of
excessive short-term indebtedness.
/1 "Long-term" loans are defined in the accounting sense, i.e., loans with
a maturity exceeding one year. Long-term loans so defined accounted for
about 50% of SMI Bank borrowings in 1978; equipment loans, however,
accounted for only 17% of total SMI borrowings.



- 15 -
2.20      Furtheraore, it was apparent that, in 1978, part of SMI fixed assets
was financed with medium-term working capital loans rather than through
sounder methods of financing such as equity and long-term equipment
borrowings. At end-1978, long-term equipment loans could be estimated at
about 6.5% /1 of assets with other "long-term" borrowings (17% of assets)
being actually medium-term working capital resources. Long-term equipment
loans and equity resources therefore represented only 27% of assets compared
to the 35% share of fixed assets in total assets. A more balanced financial
structure in the SMI sector would require (a) an increase in equity financing
from 20.5% of assets to about 30%; (b) a marginal increase in long-term
borrowings mainly in the form of equipment loans from 23.4% to about 30%; and
(c) a reduction in short-term debt from 56.1% to about 40%.
Government Policies in the Financing of SMIs
2.21      As indicated above, the Government has played an important role in
reducing past discrimination by financial institutions against long-term
lending to SMIs. The effectiveness of the Government-s strategy for
allocating funds to SMIs was made possible by (a) the establishment in the
early sixties of specialized government-owned financial institutions in
support of the SMI sector; (b) the creation of a guarantee scheme which
mitigated the financial risk involved in SMI lending, and (c) the requirement
that non-specialized financial institutions earmark a specific share of their
total lending for SM4Is.
2.22      Institutional Framework.  The existence of financial institutions
serving specific sectors of the economy (agriculture, housing, exports, large
industries and small industries) is characteristic of the highly fragmented
structure of the Korean financial system. The Small and Hedium Industry Bank
(SMIB) was estahliLshed by the Government in 1961. In 1963, the Citizens
National Bank (CNB) was created to mobilize household savings and provide
financing to its depositors. CNB's functions have gradually evolved towards
financing household and cottage enterprises and it is currently allowed to
finance small industries employing up to 100 persons. At the time of its
establishment, SMIB was authorized to finance enterprises with less than 100
employees. The limit was subsequently raised to 200 employees and, in
1977, to 300 employees./2 Both SMIB and CNB provide working capital and
equipment loans but the latter is their "raison d'etre." Because the scope of

assets.

employees in specific activities defined in Small and Medium Industry
Promotion Act of 1979.

their operations is limited to the SMI sector, they accounted jointly for a
substantial share (37%)dof all lending to the SMI sector and as much as 72%
of all SMI equipment loans outstanding as of July 31,  980 (Annex A, Table 3).
2.23      The specialized institutional framework for financing SMIs was
complemented in 1967 by a credit guarantee scheme administered by SMIB. In
1976, the Korea Credit Guarantee Fund (KCGF) was spun off as an autonomous
institution serving the needs of both large and small enterprises. KCGF
however, has been required to exzend at least 40'" (by Lmount) of its
guarantees to the SMI sector.
2.24      The Korean financial system also comprises a number of nonspecial-
ized institutions which serve the needs of industry irrespective of size.
These institutions operate alongside the two government-owned specialized
banks (CNB and SMIB) in servicing the SMI sector. Commercial banks, short-
term finance companies, foreign commercial bank branches, leasing companies
and the Korea Long-Term Credit Bank (KLB) all provide varying degrees of
financial support to the SMI sector. In practice, only the commercial banks
(nationwide and regional) have substantial lending operations to the SMI
sector because of their large resource base and loan portfolio. With 63% of
all SMI loans outstanding as of July 31, 1980, the aggregate SMI loan
portfolio of commercial banks was nearly twice as large as that of SMIB and
CNB together./1
2.25      There is substantial complementarity in the types of financial
assistance provided to the SMI sector by the commercial banks and the two
specialized banks (CNB and SMIB).  The commercial hanks provide mainly
short-term working capital loans: at end-July 1980, equipment loans
accounted for only about 6% of their SMI loan portfolio. SMIB and, to a
lesser extent, CNB, are more heavily geared towards equipment financing with
such loans accounting respectively for 36% and 10% of their portfolio.
However, as indicated in para. 2.20, lending for acquisition of equipment by
SMIs appears inadequate relative to the needs of the sector. Considerable
scope seems to exist for increasing the role of commercial banks in the
provision of long-term equipment loans.
2.26      Government Guidelines for SMI Financing.  In Korea, the Government
strictly regulates the allocation of funds by the financial sector.
Government-owned specialized banks serving SMIs have been used as a channel
for administering, in addition to their normal operations, a number of
/1 The share of the nationwide commercial banks, however, has declined from
60% of all SMI loans in 1970 down to 49% in 1979, while regional
commercial banks increased their share from 4% to 14% during the same
period (Annex A, Table 4).

subsidized lending programs funded by the Government to support priority
activities designated by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MICI) /1.
The target group of potential borrowers as well as the maximum amounts,
duration and terms of the loans are determined by the Ministries of Finance
and Industry. As for the allocation of funds by commercial banks, controls
are exercised in the form of (i) general guidelines identifying preferred,
unpreferred and prohibited industrial activities; (ii) a mandatory
requirement instated in 1976 that SMI lending account for a specific share
of the banks portfolio; and (iii) the requirement that SMI borrowers in
priority activities be considered as prime borrowers and therefore eligible
for a 0.5% p.a. rebate on the standard interest rate of commercial loans.
2.27      Government guidelines governing the SMI portfolio composition of
nearly all non-specialized financial institutions were introduced in 1976.
The requirement that the SMI sector account for 30% of the annual increase
in lending by nationwide commercial banks was raised to 35% in October 1980
and from 40% to 55% for regional commercial banks.  As of end-July 1980, the
SMI sector accounted for 32.5% and 54.5% respectively of the total
outstanding loan portfolios of nationwide and regional commercial banks.
Similarly, short-term finance companies, whose SMI operations accounted for
25% of their total portfolio as of July 31, 1980, have been required to
raise this ratio to 30%. Foreign commercial banks are expected to earmark
10% of their total portfolio for SMIs. The Long-Term Credit Bank Law also
requires that KLB allocate 20% of its lending to the SMI sector. No
specific requirement has been imposed on leasing companies but SMI operations
account for about 30% of their total portfolio. The 40% minimum requirement
imposed on the operations of the credit guarantee fund for SMI support has
remained unchanged. In fact, the SMI sector accounted for 56.6% of all
outstanding guarantees issued by the KCGF at end-June 1980.
2.28      Most of the new guidelines simply reflect actual portfolio composi-
tion and should therefore have no great impact on the flow of institutional
finance to the SMI sector. While aggregate fund flows to SMI are adequate,
the share of long-term equipment lending remains insufficient relative to
working capital finance and the recent government measures do not seem to
address this issue adequately. Equipment lending is particularly important
in the light of the objective of promoting more capital and skill intensive
investments.
Funding of SMI Lending Programs
2.29      Four special lending programs are currently in operation to provide
financial assistance to the SMI sector. In 1980, these four programs were
/1 For example, specialized machinery industries, Saemaul projects and
subcontractors.



- 18 -
expected to provide an aggregate amount of W 541 billion /1 to the sector.
The "General Loan Program for SMI" is, by far, the largest, accounting for
72% of total SMI lending in 1980. Funding is from SMIB's own resources and
from the resources supplied to SMIs by commercial banks in accordance with
government guidelines for portfolio composition. The interest subsidy is
negligible under this program. The other three lending programs are part
of the government-sponsored system of "directed/subsidized lending" and
provide a substantial interest subsidy to eligible subborrowers. In
aggregate they accounted for 28% of total SMI lending in 1980. Two of these
funds (the SMI Promotion Fund /2 and the National Investment Fund /3) are
funded directly by the Government. In aggregate, they amounted to W 41
billion in 1980, or 7.6% of total SMI funding. The third program, the
"Special Low-Interest Rate Loan Program," amounted to W 110 billion; its
funding is from SMIB's own deposit resources with an interest subsidy
rebated by the Government to compensate for the differential between the
cost of funds to SMIB and the applicable lending rate. Eligible activities
include export industries, machinery manufacturing, production of daily
necessities, defense industries, etc.
2.30      In contrast to the financing of large industry for which subsidized
lending /4 was estimated at about 55% of total outstanding loans to large
industry at end-1979, subsidized loans accounted for only a third of total
SMI loans./5 Government objectives aimed at reducing the magnitude and
scope of NIF and other subsidized lending programs to large industry should,
over time, restore greater parity in the treatment of SMI and large
industry.
Financial Expenses in the SMI Sector
2.31      Financial expenses tend to represent a substantial portion of total
expenses in Korean industry because of the high ratio of indebtedness. During
the year 1978, interest expenses amounted to about 15.6% of total SMI
/1  On a disbursement basis.
/2  The SMIPF is administered by the SMI Promotion Corporation.  Eligible
activities include machinery industries, jewelry industries, traditional
handicrafts, Saemaul factories and cooperative projects.

10% is earmarked for SMI lending.

- 19 -
profitability of SMIs (net profits to total assets have declined steadily in
the SMII sector from 6.1% in 1973 to 1.6% in 1979) renders enterprises partic-
ularly vulnerable to increases in borrowing costs. For example, the January
1980 increase of 6 percentage points /1 in borrowing costs translated into a
30% increase in financial expenses for Korean industry, i.e., approximately
1.1% of total assets on an after-tax basis. The upward adjustment of interest
rates would have wiped out about 66% of SMI net profits assuming that
profitability had remained at the 1979 level.  In fact, the economic recession
has further constrained profitability in the manufacturing sector and although
recent statistics are not available, substantial losses have been reported in
Korean industry.
2.32      The vulnerability of Korean industry to interest rate fluctuations
results largely from its high indebtedness, and also from the Korean practice
of applying new interest rates to all loans, including long-term borrowings
contracted prior to a change in the interest rate structure. This practice
which is equivalent to a variable interest rate on long-term loans would be
justified if substantial term transformation were achieved in the financial
system.  It does not appear, however, that Korean financial institutions use
short-term resources for funding their term lending and therefore need to
pass on to their borrowers of term loans the higher cost of short-term
resources resulting from an increase in deposit rates.  Given the present
stage of development of the Korean financial system, its seems desirable to
encourage financial institutions to offer to their customers the option of
fixed rate long-term borrowings for financing equipment purchases. Fixed
rate borrowings could be made available within the limit of the fixed rate
resources available to financial institutions. Variable rate long-term loans
could also be offered to allow some element of term transformation. The
availability of fixed rate long-term equipment loans should be viewed as
(a) an incentive for Korean industry to restructure its liabilities by
lessening reliance on short to medium term resources and perhaps more
importantly (b) as a means of developing the Korean capital market through the
issuance by financial institutions of long-term instruments of indebtedness
such as bonds and debentures.
Interest Rate Structure
2.33      The erosion of profitability induced by the Governmlent's abrupt
increase in lending rates in January 1980 became rapidly unbearable for Korean
industry. The Government acknowledged the difficulties faced by industrial-
ists and scaled down lending rate levels in three steps, in June, September
and November 1980, by about 5 percentage points in aggregate. Annex A,
Table 5 shows Korea's interest rate structure following these adjustments.
In November 1980, standard lending rates for equipment loans ranged from
/1 From a standard rate of 20% to 26% p.a.



- 20 -
19.5% to 22% depending on loan maturity and on the borrower's credit-
worthiness. Applicable rates for working capital loans also ranged from
19.5% to 22% depending on the type of loan.
2.34      The aggregate decline in deposit rates since June 1980 has outpaced
the decline in lending rates, thus increasing the spread between deposit and
lending rates.  As a result, average deposit rates were marginally lower in
November 1980 than a year earlier while lending rates were 1% higher. This
Government policy of increasing the interest spread accruing to financial
intermediaries has been complemented by a lowering of reserves requirements /1
which effectively Lncreased lending margins.
2.35      In addition to the above changes in Korea's interest rate structure,
the Government has started a process of reduction of the subsidy elements in
the lending programs for large industries (NIF and export credits)./2
Subsidies available under lending programs aimed at SMIs, however, have not
been reduced substantially. Applicable rates range from 10% to 17% p.a. for
the SMI Promotion Fund and 18% to 19% for the Special Loan Program. The
decision not to reduce subsidies under SMI specific lending programs reflects
the feeling in some government circles that, in the past, subsidized credit
was unduly limited to large industries, thus resulting in higher average
financial expenses in the SMI sector. However, the reduction in subsidies
granted to large industry is expected to remove the bias. The need for
maintaining interest subsidies in the SMI sector would need to be reassessed
critically by the Government in the context of the financial sector reform.
2.36      The impact of subsidized lending on the level of investment in
preferred SMI subsectors is, at best, marginal because of the multiplicity of
lending rates and terms applicable to specific priority subsectors. Lending
rates and terms are fixed by the Government and vary depending on the degree
of priority attached to a particular activity (machinery industry, Saemaul
project, enterprises located in industrial estates, etc.) but also and less
justifiably depending on the source of funds (NIF, SMIPF, etc.), a variable
over which the borrower obviously has no control.  Borrowing terms therefore
may vary for projects operating within the same branch of activity and have
little bearing on project risks and benefits. The allocative efficiency of
the system is doubtful since potential investors are not in position to
determine in advance the applicable borrowing conditions. A simplification
of the interest rate structure would be desirable and could be achieved by
the Government through a reorganization of the system of "directed/
subsidized lending" for financial industry.

- 21 -
2.37      Inflation.  During 1980, the depreciation of the Won against the
US dollar reached 36%. This rapid decline in the value of the Won following
five years of stability, increased inflationary pressures. In the ten-month
period January-October 1980, cumulative inflation reached 32.1%. By October,
the wholesale price index was growing at a reduced annual rate of 19.2%. The
Government is projecting wholesale price increases of 20-25% in 1981 and
10-15% in 1982. In relation to expected inflation in 1981, the present
interest rate structure is negative in real terms, particularly in the case
of deposit rates./l Given the fact that, in practice, interest rates on
long-term loans and deposits are flexible in Korea, expected inflation in
the medium-term is not a critical parameter in determining the appropriate-
ness of the current interest rate structure.
2.38      The principle of maintaining interest rates at a positive level
over the medium- and long-term has been accepted by the Korean Government in
the context of its discussions with the Bank on the reform of the financial
system. The Government feels that frequent changes in interest rates based
on short-term variations in inflation rates, as Korea experienced in 1980,
could be destabilizing. It is, however, the Government's intention to keep
interest rates under periodic (at least annual) review. The Government's
commitment to maintaining interest rates at a positive level in real terms
was evidenced in January 1980 when a 6% upward adjustment was enforced.
Other constraints, namely the high leverage of Korean industry and its poor
financial structure made the resulting increase in financial expenses
practically unbearable at a time of severe economic recession. The downward
adjustments of interest rates which followed in three stages represented a
pragmatic response to this constraint. Priority should now be attached to
improving the financial structure of Korean industry over time, so as to
restore some flexibility in the efficiency of such monetary and financial
policy instruments as interest rates. The role of financial sector policies
and of financial intermediaries is critical in ensuring that, over time,
equity financing account for a larger share of industrial investment.
The Bank's Lending Strategy for Industry
2.39      For over a decade, the Bank's industrial lending strategy in Korea
has been premised on the development of a strong institutional base of
Development Finance Companies (DFCs) acting as intermediaries for channelling
/1 In relation to the projected GNP deflator for 1981 (19.3%), standard
lending rates are marginally positive.



- 22 -
resources including Bank funds to industry.  This type of lending was   =
initiated in 1968 with a loan to the Korea Development Finance Corporation
(KDFC) /1. To date, eight Bank loans, aggregating to $410 million, have
been made to KDFC.  Over time, the Bank has established direct relationships
with other long-term lending institutions serving particular segments of the
industrial spectrum.  Lending to the Korea Development Bank (KDB) started in
1975.  Four Bank loans have been extended to KDB in the past five years for a
total of $352.5 million. Although Bank resources accounted for a limited
part of KDB and KDFC's total lending operations, the Bank has contributed
significantly to meeting the needs of large-scale industry through these two
intermediaries. Financial assistance by the Bank to smaller-scale
enterprises was initiated in 1975 with a loan to SMIB. Three Bank loans have
been channelled to SMIB for an aggregate amount of $145 million; the proposed
loan would be the fourth operation with SMIB. Coverage of the very small end
of the SMI sector was improved in 1980 with a loan of $30 million to CNB.
Having established lending relationships with the four major DFCs operating
in the industrial sector, the Bank is now in a position to help cover the
foreign exchange requirements of the entire spectrum of industry. The
critical role played by the four DFCs in the supply of long-term finance to
Korean industry is reflected in the fact that, in aggregate, they provided
45.8% of the increase in medium- and long-term loans extended to the
manufacturing sector in 1977-79.
2.40       The major objectives of Bank lending through DFCs in Korea were
(a) resource transfer to provide the foreign exchange resources needed for
industrial development; (b) support of the government's industrial strategy
including promotion of balanced growth through regional development,
employment generation, export orientation and skill development; and (c)
strengthening the institutional base for efficient financial intermediation.
These three objectives will remain at the forefront of the Bank's lending
strategy in the eighties. The institution-building process will be pursued
further although substantial progress has already been achieved in this area.
The significant maturity attained in the Korean financial sector, partly as a
result of the Bank's assistance in strengthening institutional capabilities,
makes it possible for the Bank to shift its lending objectives from
microinstitutional issues to broader sectoral issues.
2.41       The recent Bank loans to KDB and KLB were predicated on such a
broad-based, macro-economic approach. The two loans provided a vehicle for
discussing with the Korean Government the blue print of a major reform of the
financial sector aimed at liberalizing the operations of financial institu-
tions. It is expected that the agreements reached at the time of negotiation
of these two projects will ultimately improve the responsiveness of the

financial system to the requirements of Korean industry and will help improve
investment efficiency. The Bank's dialogue with the Government on financial
sector issues has been proceeding in parallel with a greater involvement in
the formulation of a development strategy for the industrial sector which
would bring about the structural adjustments necessitated by the changing
environment in which Korean industry operates. The Bank plans to discuss with
the Government the broad question of industrial investment strategy and
incentives in industry in the context of the Bank's economic and sector work
program.
2.42      Structural adjustment lending and financial sector loans provide the
vehicles for a closer involvement by the Bank in the moulding of Korea's
financial and industrial sector developments. The strategies and policy
measures adopted by the Government in both sectors at a macroeconomic level
are expected, over time, to eliminate gradually distortions in factor prices
and policies at the subsector level. In the interim, concerted action may be
required in specific subsectors facing difficulties or in areas where
new products and technologies are being developed. The Bank's macro-based
lending strategy may therefore need to be complemented by a direct involvement
in the restructuring and/or rehabilitation of specific subsectors. The Bank
is currently considering subsector projects for technology development and for
the support of engineering industries which would emphasize skill development
in Korean industry. The proposed loan to SMIB is designed as a subsector
operation which supplements other efforts in the industrial sector by improv-
ing the efficiency of enterprises at the lower end of the industrial spectrum.
3. THE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK
A. The Role of SMIB in the Financial System
3.01      The Korean financial system is higly specialized.  It comprises:
(a) banking institutions which along with the (central) Bank of Korea (BOK)
form the monetary system; and (b) nonbank institutions which, unlike banking
institutions, do not mobilize deposits from the general public.
3.02      Banking institutions comprise mainly the commercial banks (39% of
total assets in the financial sector in 1979) and six specialized banks
which mobilize and allocate funds to specific sectors of the economy (e.g.,
small-scale industry and agriculture).  The specialized banks accounted for
23% of the assets of the financial sector in 1979. The operations of
specialized banks can best be characterized as a mix of commercial banking
operations (i.e., short-term working capital lending) and development
finance (i.e., long-term lending in foreign and domestic currency). SMIB



- 24 -
and CNB are the two specialized banks operating in the SMI sector. Their
asset size /1 is comparable and each accounts for about 2.5% of the
financial sector's total assets.
3.03      Nonbank financial institutions /2 comprise institutions which
specialize in the mobilization of specific types of savings (e.g., insurance
and short-term finance companies) and development banks specialized in
allocating long-term resources to particular branches of the economy. The
Korea Development Bank (KDB) and the Korea Long-Term Credit Bank (KLB) are,
among nonbank institutions, the two major sources of long-term finance for
large industry.
3.04      The group of commercial banks accounted for about 55% of all
incremental lending to the manufacturing sector in 1979. Short-term
lending, however, represented 83% of total commercial bank lending over the
period 1977-79. Loans with a maturity exceeding one year accounted for the
17% balance, but only part of these loans (about 70%) were supplied by
commercial banks for financing equipment purchases. The supply of long-term
development finance in support of investment in the Korean industrial sector
is practically confined to four institutions: CNB and SMIB for smaller
enterprises, KDB and KLB for large industries.
3.05      The functional demarcation among the four DFCs is broadly as
follows. At one extreme of the industrial spectrum, the government-owned
KDB concentrates on financing large enterprises, public and private, in the
manufacturing, transportation and power sectors. Borrowers eligible for
financial support from KDB are defined as enterprises whose employment
exceeds 300 persons and whose assets are more than W 500 million
($760,000). Equipment loans accounted for 86% of KDB-s loan portfolio at
end July 1980. The privately-owned KLB also concentrates on the financing
of relatively large, but exclusively private sector firms./3 Prior to its
conversion into a long-term credit bank in June 1980, KLB almost exclusively
provided long-term foreign currency financing. It has since increased
substantially the level of its domestic currency operations. The
government-owned CNB and SMIB specialize in assisting the smaller end of the
industrial spectrum. Because short- and medium-term deposits account for
/1  SMIB's total assets amounted to W 1,256 billion ($1.9 billion) as of
September 30, 1980.
/2 In aggregate nonbank institutions accounted for 25% of the assets of the
financial sector in 1979; development banks alone represented 15% of
financial sector assets.
/3 Its charter, however, requires that 20% of its lending operations be
directed towards the SMI sector.



- 25 -
the bulk of their resources, short- and medium-term lending for working
capital accounts for a major share of their total operations. Both,
however, are important sources of domestic and foreign currency equipment
financing for the SMI sector.
3.06      Despite some overlap in the functions of the four Korean DFCs,
demand for industrial financing, particularly for equipment finance, far
exceeds available resources so that the four institutions and the commer-
cial banks operate in a complementary rather than a competitive fashion.
3.07      The SMIB Act confines SMIB's financing to "small and medium
enterprises" as defined in the Presidential Decree enforcing the Act. Since
1976, eligible borrowers are defined as enterprises with either total assets
not exceeding W 500 million ($760,000) or with less than 300 employees.
These two upper limits constitute the official demarcation between SMIB and
KDB; if an enterprise qualifies as an SMI under either or both of these
limits, it is eligible for borrowing from SMIB, not from KDB./1  CNB is
allowed to finance enterprises with 5 to 100 employees with no upper limit
imposed on the asset size of potential borrowers.  Such enterprises can,
therefore, obtain financing from either CNB or SMIB.  This overlap in the
clienteles of CNB and SMIB was intended to improve the access of very small
enterprises to institutional financing. In practice, CNB concentrates on
the informal/cottage industry segment of SMI while SMIB operates mostly in
the organized, modern subsector.
3.08      Although the criteria used in the definition of SMIB and KDB's
respective clientele appear to be clear, in practice, the interface between
the two is somewhat fuzzy for a number of reasons. First, the asset and
employment sizes of SMIB's borrowers are determined at the time of loan
application, so that applicants which are close to the limits of the SMI
definition can virtually exceed the eligibility criteria as soon as they
receive a loan.  In recognition of this inherent contradiction, a revision
of the SMIB Act was approved by the Government in February 1980 which
stipulates that clients of SMIB who, in the course of transactions with SMIB
came to exceed the eligibility criteria may remain clients of SMIB for a
period of 3 years./2  Second, the SMI Promotion Law enacted in 1979 raised
to 500 employees (with no asset limit) thie cut-off point between SMI and
large industries for specific activities in the manufacturing sector (e.g.,
/1  An additional lower limit of 5 employees is imposed on the size of
applicants eligible for assistance from SMIB.
/2  The arbitrary 3-year period, however, remains inadequate for borrowers
of long-term equipment loans.

automobile and bicycle parts, hand tools, watches, etc.)./l As the
onlending agent of the proceeds of the SMI Promotion Fund, SMIB is,
therefore, led to financing enterprises which would otherwise qualify as
large industries. Third and more importantly, former SMIB borrowers which
outgrow the eligibility criteria for SMIB financing are often not able to
obtain financing from KDB. This results from KDB's basic role as financier
of priority activities as defined in the KDB Act (i.e., power, coal, mining,
shipbuilding, iron and steel, semiconductors, marine and air transportation).
Although KDB is not precluded from financing light industrial activities,
its resources are limited and are effectively preempted by heavy industrial
projects. Former SMIB borrowers are, therefore, compelled to turn to the
commercial banks for further financial assistance. This also entails
considerable difficulties as commercial banks emphasize working-capital
financing and provide little financing for equipment purchases. The
emergence of KLB as a major source of domestic and foreign currency
equipment loans may help solve this problem in the future, as would an
increased commercial bank role in equipmaent financing./2 It is clear,
however, that at present the highly fragmented nature of the Korean financial
system effectively acts as an impediment to the upward mobility of SMIs.
B. Institutional Aspects
Legal and Policy Framework
3.09      Legal Framework.  The Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMIB) was
incorporated under the Small and Medium Industry Bank Act of 1961. SMIB is
a government-owned /3 banking institution specialized in extending financial
and technical assistance to small- and medium-sized industries. As a
banking institution, it is engaged in a wide range of commercial banking
activities including mobilization of deposits, issuance of letters of credit
and short-term lending for working capital. As a development institution,
it provides long-term finance to its borrowers and has thus become a key
/1 The law also stipulates a minimum size of 50 persons and W 100 million
in total assets for SMIs to be eligible for financing under the SMI
Promotion Fund.
/2 The latter alternative is currently being studied by the Government as
part of the financial sector reform.
/3 Except for residual private holdings of W 16 million (0.03% of SMIB's
end-1980 share capital) which were incorporated in its share capital at
the time of establishment.



- 27 -
tool for fostering SMI development in Korea. The SMIB Act, the Presidential
Decree enforcing the Act and the SMIB By-Laws constitute a comprehensive
legal framework for SMIB's organization, policies, operations,
administration, and capitalization. Like other specialized banks and
development institutions, SMIB's operations, financial performance and
management are subject to the close supervision of the Ministry of Finance.
The General Banking Act which is administered by the Bank of Korea governs
SMIB's commercial banking activities.
3.10      Board of Policy and Board of Directors.  The SMIB Act provides for
a Board of Policy and a Board of Directors; SMIB's President serves as
Chairman of both. The Board of Policy comprises government officials and
representatives of the SMI sector selected by the Government (Annex B,
Appendix 1); its primary function is to formulate lending policies and
guidelines. The Board of Directors is a standing body of SMIB's senior
management (Annex B, Appendix 2) with executive authority on important
matters related to SMIB's operations. SMIB-s dual Board structure has
proved to be appropriate and effective. It allows the Government and the
SMI business community to participate in the formulation of lending policies
and ensures SMIB-s autonomy in day-to-day operational decisions, and
adequately provides continuity in administration and decision-making.
3.11      Operating Policies and Development Strategy.  In 1969, SMIB-s
Board of Policy adopted a Policy Statement which supplements the policy and
operational guidelines of the SMIB Act. Aside from restrictions on the
maximum exposure of SMIB in any single enterprise,/l this statement defines
in broad terms, the types of industries to which SMIB should give priority
in its lending operations (i.e. export-oriented and import substituting
industries as well as labor-intensive projects).
3.12      Since 1975, SMIB has formulated, in consultation with the Bank,
three successive Development Strategy Statements outlining its specific
developmental objectives for two-year periods of operations. These state-
ments show a considerable degree of continuity in SMIB's objectives such as
improving the geographical and sectoral dispersal of operations, promotion
of small and labor-intensive projects, encouraging subcontracting arrange-
ments, and improving resource mobilization. Beyond this, the strategy for
1980/81 calls for SMIB actively to assist the machinery subsector and
strengthen its research activities, with particular emphasis on sector and
market studies (Annex B, Appendix 3). Satisfactory progress has been made
by SMIB in implementing past objectives. In response to the need for SMIB
to diversify its domestic and foreign currency long-term resources (paras.
3.55 and 3.61), SMIB agreed to amend its Development Strategy Statement for
1982-83 to reflect to this requirement (Annex B, Appendix 4).
/l 25% of its own equity and 60% of the client's total assets.

Institutional Efficiency
3.13      Management.  Mr. Sun Sang Park, formerly SMIB's Deputy President,
was appointed President in July 1980. He is assisted by a Deputy President,
and five Executive Directors, each in charge of three to four of SMIB's 18
departments. SMIB-s top management team, as well as the managers and deputy
managers of the departments and branch offices, have considerable
professional experience and provide SMIB with effective leadership.
3.14      organization and Staffing.  SMIB's head office in Seoul comprises
18 departments (see organization chart). With the aim of mobilizing
deposits and spreading its services more evenly over the country, SMIB has
rapidly expanded its branch network from 65 in mid-1977 to 116 in 1980.
Loan processing, including approval authority for loans below certain
amounts /1 is delegated to the branches. In October 1980, SMIB opened a
representative office in New York and plans to open similar offices in other
international financial centers. Such offices might ultimately play an
important role in mobilizing foreign currency commercial resources.
3.15      In September 1980, SMIB's staff numbered 4,815, of which 24% were
senior professionals. Branch personnel accounted for 74% of total staff.
During the past 21 months, staff strength has increased by 19% and is pro-
jected to increase by 33% to 6,380 by end-1984 (Annex B, Table 1). Staff
turnover /2 for the institution as a whole was 7.6% in 1978 and 1979 and
declined t 6.4% (on an annual basis) during the first 9 months of 1980.
The turnover of professional staff was lower (4%) and involved only a small
number of key personnel (deputy managers and above). It had no discernable
impact on SMIB's operational efficiency.
3.16      Administrative-expenses.  SMIB-s expanding branch network and
staff strength have contributed to a rapid increase in its administrative
expenses. In relation to its average total assets, however, SMIB's
administrative expenses have remained at about 3% to 3.5%.   Wages and
salaries accounted for an average of 73% of total administrative expenses
over the period 1977-79. SMIB estimates that, in 1979, administrative
expenses related to deposit mobilization accounted for 2.3% of the average
annual deposit balance /3 and administrative costs related to lending
/1 $100,000 for foreign currency loans and W 50 million for domestic
currency loans.
/2 Resignations, other than mandatory retirements to average number of
staff during the year.
/3 Including reserve requirements, total mobilization costs add about 3.9%
to the average interest cost (13.5%) of SMIB's deposit resources.



- 29 -
Korean commercial banks. Expenses related to lending operations are also on
par with those of other Korean DFCs /1 and reflect a satisfactory degree of
efficiency in SMIB's operations.
3.17      Training.  SMIB's professional staff is mostly recruited among
college graduates trained through external and in-house courses /2 as well
as a system of rotational assignments within SMIB. While the qualification
of staff appears to be generally good, training programs are largely confined
to commercial banking techniques. There is a clear need for intensified
training in the more sophisticated techniques of subsector economic analyses
and project evaluation. During negotiations for the proposed loan, SMIB
presented to the Bank for its review, its ongoing staff training program for
1981 which is designed to: build up the capability of its staff, particularly
at the branch level, in subsector economic analysis and project appraisal
through intensified internal training; and to provide an increased number of
staff with external and overseas training courses on project appraisal. The
2981 training program proposes to provide such training opportunities for
866 of SMIB-s professional staff (20% of the total professional staff), 97%
of whom will be branch staff.
3.18      Project Appraisal.  Most loan applications are processed through
the branches. Throughout the appraisal process, branch and head office
staff coordinate work closely with the latter operating in an advisory
capacity. For working capital loans, SMIB's lending decisions are
essentially based on an assessment of the client's credit standing and on
available collateral, rather than on project analysis, a practice in line
with sound commercial banking. An elaborate point scoring system serves as
the basis for the lending decision. Scoring is also used for the
preliminary screening of applications for equipment loans.
3.19      SMIB, like most other Korean DFCs, applies different appraisal
standards in the processing of domestic and foreign currency equipment
loans. The procedures applied in the appraisal of domestic currency equip-
ment loans are heavily influenced by commercial lending practices: quick
financing decisions in favor of solvent clients tend to outweigh
considerations on the financial and economic viability of projects. Time
consuming techniques of technical, market, financial and economic analysis
are kept to a minimum. This results largely from the fact that the terms
(lending rate, duration and maximum amount) of domestic currency loans are
predetermined by the Government on the basis of the project's assumed
priority, not on the basis of projected cash flow, repayment capacity and
/1  About 1% of average total assets.
/2  In 1979, training courses have been organized for 1,035 staff members;
845 receivedl in-house training with emphasis on credit analysis, 96
received training from outside institutions, and 94 underwent overseas
training.

benefits. This type of government control and interference in lending
decisions effectively makes detailed project analysis a somewhat artificial
and irrelevant exercise. Some improvement in the appraisal standards of
Korean financial institutions may occur in the future when the Government
implements its new policy of liberalizing the operations of the financial
sector. There is considerable scope in Korea for improving the efficiency
of financial institutions Ln the appraisal of investment proposals since
demand for credit has traditionally exceeded available resources. The
process of improvement in credit rationing mechanisms will obviously take
time. A clear implication is that financial institutions will have to move
away from the bureaucratic approach of the past and considerable investment
will be required in staff training. As indicated in para. 3.17, SMIB is
already taking steps to improve the appraisal capabilities of its staff. As
the quality of its appraisals of foreign currency loans is markedly better
than its appraisal of domestic currency loans, staff training will focus on
improving the latter.
3.20      The appraisal quality of foreign currency loans is markedly better
than for domestic currency loans. Full appraisal reports including computa-
tion of financial and economic rates of return are submitted by SMIB for
subprojects exceeding the free limit imposed by ADB and IBRD ($500,000).
Despite the limited number of subprojects for which SMIB has submitted full
appraisal reports to the Bank /1 under loan 1749-K0, the quality was
satisfactory. The appraisal standard of projects below the free limit is
understandbly lower, reflecting the difficulty of striking a balance between
efficiency in processing a large number of applications and quality.
3.21      Under the second and third Bank loans, it was agreed that SMIB
should speed up the processing of subprojects below the free limit by
simplifying its appraisal methods and submitting to the Bank project
summaries instead of full appraisal reports. Simplified appraisal methods
were considered appropriate as long as this had no negative impact on the
economic and financial quality of the projects financed by SMIB. To this
end, it was agreed /2 that SMIB's Research Department would undertake sector
and subsector studies to justify sectoral priorities and prospects with such
analysis substituting for a detailed economic appraisal of individual
projects. It appears, however, that the sector work carried out by SMIB's
Research Department is not sufficiently integrated in SMIB-s appraisal
process. Furthermore, the recent economic downturn has substantially eroded
profitability in several branches of the industrial sector and closer
scrutiny of investment proposals seems to be justified. During negotia-
tions, SMIB confirmed through an amendment in its Development Strategy
/1 Six out of 250 subprojects.

- 31 -
Statement (Annex B, Appendix 4), that it will continue to strengthen its
research activities, placing particular emphasis on sector and market
studies for SMI. In an attempt to more consistently apply the findings of
these studies directly to its operations, SMIB will take the measures
necessary to increase the coordination between its research and project
appraisal departments.
3.22      The training program presented to the Bank by SMIB at negotiations
(para. 3.17) in combination with improved coordination between SMIB's
research and project appraisal departments (para. 3.21) would increase the
proficiency of SMIB's staff in appraisal techniques and should result in
improved appraisal work throughout the institution. In addition, the Bank
informed SMIB during loan negotiations that, in the course of Bank super-
vision, specific attention will be given to the thoroughness of appraisal
reports on subprojects below the free limit. Project supervision would
involve reviewing a randomly drawn sample of reports from each of four
subsectors where currently some difficulties are being encountered. These
are, provisionally, machinery, foodstuffs, wood products and textiles. The
Bank would also expect to receive copies of sector work carried out by
SMIB's Research Department in these four subsectors.
3.23      Project Supervision.  Project follow-up is largely delegated to
the branch offices, except for foreign currency loans which are supervised
jointly by the F'oreign Loan Department at head office and the branches.
Projects under supervision are normally visited at least once a year;
projects with loans above W 50 million and problem projects are visited more
frequently, in some cases once a month. Branch staff have frequent contacts
with borrowers, who usually maintain deposit accounts with SMIB, and are
therefore well placed to diagnose implementation and operational problems at
an early stage. The branch managers have received some training in basic
managerial and financial consultancy services. More complex problems are
referred to the Extension Services Department at head office and, in some
cases, to the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST). SMIB has
developed an excellent follow-up reporting system./l Follow-up record cards
are kept for each subproject and allow periodic analysis of projected versus
actual project data. The Investment and Credit Analysis Department also
visits clients once a year and prepares detailed reports on their credit
standing.  SMIB's project supervision methods have been very effective, as
is reflected in the quality of its portfolio and the low level of arrears.
/1 The Foreign Loan Department has developed, in consultation with the
Bank, an independent System of Operation Report Summaries whereby actual
project performance is compared with projected operations prepared at
the time of appraisal. A population of 223 subprojects has been covered
in two annual exercises covering projects implemented in 1976 and 1977.
A third batch of projects implemented in 1978 is under preparation.
Results show that appraisal estimates of sales volume and capacity uti-
lization were fairly accurate with a standard deviation of less than 5%.



- 32 -
3.24      Procurement.  SMIB-s procurement procedures conform to government
guidelines and to the special requirements of small firms. Until 1978,
international competitive bidding procedures were applied for some of the
larger projects requiring foreign currency loans. Because of the large
number of subprojects, these procedures were considered expensive and time
consuming. Procurement is now normally based on limited competitive
bidding procedures with three to four competitive quc,tations from potential
suppliers. In some cases, however, SMIB has been following procurement
procedures which aimed at expediting procurement but which did not ensure a
satisfactory degree of competition. In addition, as SMIB plans to place
increased emphasis on financing fixed investments in order to improve the
productivity and quality of output of small and medium industries, it will
have to give increased attention to ensuring the adequacy and effectiveness
of its procurement procedures. To this end, it was agreed at negotiations
that in order to foster competition among supplies, each subborrower would
be required to obtain at least three quotes from suppliers. Furthermore,
all appraisal reports for subprojects sent to the Bank for approval would
contain a paragraph describing the procurement procedure to be followed and
justifying any deviation from the required numbers of bids. For subprojects
above the proposed free limit ($500,000), the suitability of applying ICB
procurement procedures would be reviewed and SMIB's decision not to enforce
ICB procedures would need to be fully justified.
C. Operations and Efficiency in Resource Allocation
Overview of SMIB's Operations
3.25      Because of the diversified mix of its resources, SMIB is in a
position to offer to its clients a fairly complete package of financial
services which comprises working capital loans, overdrafts, discounting of
trade bills, operation of deposit accounts, equipment loans in domestic and
foreign currency and other general banking services. In addition, it also
provides nonfinancial supporting services to SMIs, albeit on a limited
scale. SMIB's portfolio comprised over 20,000 clients as of end September
1980, or approximately two thirds of all enterprises operating in the SMI
sector. Total outstanding loans amounted to W 906.9 million ($1.4 billion)
of which 67% were working capital loans and 33% equipment loans.
3.26      Equipment Loans.  As of September 30, 1980, SMIB-s outstanding
portfolio of long-term equipment loans amounted to W 300 billion ($461.5
million) and accounted for 33% of the total loan portfolio. The share of
equipment loans in SMIB's portfolio has declined steadily from 38% in 1978,
to 35% and 33% respectively at year-end 1979 and end-September 1980. This
relative decline resulted primarily from a slow growth of foreign currency
equipment loans relative to total lending,/l a recent phenomenon which
affects all the Korean financial institutions involved in term lending.
This trend is accompanied by a higher demand for long-term domestic currency
financing as the &orean machinery industry develops and becomes increasingly
/1 From 22.1% of total loan portfolio in 1978 to 17.9% in 1980.



- 33 -
capable to satisfy the domestic market.  SMIB's domestic currency equipment
lending, however, has not been growing as fast as could have been expected.
Domestic currency equipment loans have declined marginally from 15.9% of
SMIB's total loan portfolio in 1978 to 15.2% at end-September 1980 (Annex B,
Table 2).
3.27      Based on the average composition of assets in the SMI sector, for-
eign currency expenditures (direct and indirect) can be estimated at about
one third of fixed assets. One should consequently expect a ratio of 2:1 in
SMIB's domestic currency equipment lending relative to foreign currency.
SMIB has moved in this direction in recent years with domestic currency
loans increasing their share of total approvals of equipment loans from 54%
in 1978 to 63% in 1980. The shorter maturity of domestic currency loans,/1
however, translates into a higher share of foreign currency loans in the
outstanding portfolio (53% over the period 1978-80).  In order to better
meet the demand for equipment financing in the SMI sector, SMIB needs to
increase substantially its domestic currency financing while also
lengthening the maturities of such loans. Resource availability being a
major constraint in achieving this objective, the Bank discussed with
SMIB at negotiations the possibility of increasing the mobilization of
medium- to long-term domestic resources such as debentures (para. 3.59).
3.28      SMIB's approvals of equipment loans have been growing rapidly in
the period 1978-79 with an average increase of over 55% p.a. in nominal
terms, about 35% p.a. in real terms. Up until 1979, the growth in SMIB's
lending was largely a function of resource availability; in 1980, however,
the severe economic recession caused a substantial decline in investment
demand and in the volume of SMIB's approvals of equipment loans. In nominal
terms, domestic c:urrency equipment loans reached only 66% of 1979
approvals;/2 approvals of foreign currency equipment loans amounted to $41
million, only 43% of 1979 approvals ($94.8 million).
3.29      Working Capital Loans.  Working capital financing (loans,
overdrafts and bill discounting) accounts for an increasing part of SMIB's
operations. Net approvals of working capital loans which accounted for 49%
of total loan approvals in 1978 rose to 58% in 1979 and 77% in 1980.
Discounting of commercial bills (17% of SMIB-s working capital portfolio at
ead September 1980) is financed through the Bank of Korea's rediscounting
facility. Overdrafts and working capital loans (respectively 4% and 79% of
the working capital portfolio) are financed from SMIB's deposit resources.
SMIB's working capital portfolio has increased by 46% p.a. in the period
1978/79 and by 38% in the first 9 months of 1980./3 The positive real
/1 7.5 years on average for foreign currency loans comitted in 1978-79 as
against 5.5 years for domestic currency equipment loans.
/2 51% in real terms (adjusted by GNP deflator); with 1980 figures
adjusted on annual basis.

- 34 -
growth in SMIB's working capital portfolio in 1980, in sharp contrast with
the negative growth recorded in equipment financing, resulted from a
substantial build up of inventories in industry. Over the past three years,
short-term working capital loans have retained a share of approximately 80%
of SMIB-s total portfolio of working capital loans. The average turnover in
SMIB-s working capital portfolio is 7 weeks.
3.30      Guarantee Operations.  SMIB issues short-term guarantees against
trading documents and payment of import duties as part of the commercial
banking services provided to its borrowers (Annex B, Table 3). As of
September 30, 1979, short-term guarantees accounted for 99% of SMIB-s total
outstanding guarantee portfolio (W 15.1 billion). Only two long-term
guarantees were outstanding for W 0.2 billion./l
3.31      Equity Operations.  The Government is planning to establish an
independent venture capital company authorized to subscribe to stocks and
debentures of SMIs established as joint-stock companies. In the interim,
SMIB and the Guarantee Fund have been required to operate investment depart-
ments. Operational guidelines have been issued by the Government and SMIB
was expected to earmark W 10 billion in 1980 and W 20 billion in 1981 for
such operations. Start-up has now been postponed to 1981. The desirability
of SMIB engaging substantial manpower resources into equity investment oper-
ations is doubtful given the limited demand in the SMI sector for this type
of assistance. There are good prospects, however, for SMIB to take an ac-
tive role in debenture subscription since this type of financing operations
is similar to term lending and SMIB already has the necessary expertise.
3.32      Extension Services.  Shortly after its establishment, SMIB started
providing technical assistance to SMI enterprises, initially limiting its
services to managerial guidance. The scope was subsequently expanded to
include technological consultancy. SMIB received substantial assistance
from the UNDP/ILO between 1968 and 1974 in order to build up its capability.
An Extension Services Department (ESD) was established, its staff trained,
extension manuals written, and SMIB was thereafter in a position to provide
managerial, financial and technical consultancy services to SMI enterprises
in Korea (not restricted to SMIB clients). The scope and quality of
services provided by SMIB has since declined substantially.
3.33      The ESD, at present, numbers a total of 32 professionals of whom
29 are engineers and 3 are trained in managerial guidance. Only seven
persons work exclusively on extension services; the others are in charge of
appraising collateral and analyze the technical aspects of loan applica-
tions. The ESD provides on-site and written consultancy services primarily
on technical problems encountered by client firms in ceramics, textiles,
machine tool and electric/electronics industries. In addition, the ESD
conducts professional seminars and publishes a technical newsletter. SMIB

presently does not charge any fee for its consultancy services. Extension
assistance has declined discernibly in recent years. In-plant consultancy
cases have decreased from 155 in 1978 to 46 in 1979 and 30 in the first half
of 1980. SMIB is aware of the deficiencies of its extension services and it
plans to set up a separate unit exclusively for extension work; in addition
to the seven extension officers mentioned above, the unit would be
reinforced with 8 additional engineers and 2 managerial specialists. The
desirability of an expansion of SMIB's role in the provision of technical
assistance, particularly in the field of production technology where
financial institutions usually have difficulties attracting people of the
right caliber, is to be reviewed in the context of the study of extension
services for SMI agreed upon with the Government during negotiations (para.
2.15).
Efficiency in Resource Allocation
3.34      SMIB's efficiency in allocating its loanable resources is measured
in the following discussion in terms of its ability to fulfill government
objectives in the SMI sector, namely, promotion of manufacturing enterprises
in priority subsectors (e.g. machinery), export orientation, geographic
dlispersal of investment and promotion of small-scale, labor-intensive
projects.
3.35      Sectoral Distribution.  The manufacturing sector accounted for 91%
of SMIB's total outstanding loan portfolio as of September 30, 1980 and for
97% of all equipment loans outstanding. The higher proportion of working
capital loans outstanding in nonmanufacturing activities relative to
equipment loans (12% compared to 3%) reflects the greater working capital
requirements of the service and construction subsectors. Within
manufacturing, textiles and machinery were the two dominant subsectors
accounting respectively for 31.1% and 30.1% of outstanding equipment loans.
In 1980,/1 however, SMIB's commitments to the manufacturing sector declined
to 90.7% of total commitments of equipment loans compared to 97.7% in 1979.
Construction and transportation increased their share considerably from 1.7%
of total commitments of equipment loans in 1979 to 8.2% in 1980 (Annex B,
Table 4).
3.36      The share of textile projects in SMIB's commitments has declined
steadily from 45% of total equipment loans to the manufacturing sector in
1976 to 28% in 1977, 21.6% in 1979 and 19.6% in 1980. SMIB's lending to
textiles had traditionally exceeded the share of this subsector in SMI
manufacturing investment (about 16% in 1978-79).  The remaining emphasis on
this subsector reflects the priority placed by SMIB on the promotion of
export-oriented, labor-intensive industries in accordance with its policy
and strategy statements, although recently, there has been a trend towards
/1 All figures for 1980 relate to the period January-September only.



- 36 -
more capital intensity of investment in textiles./l The share of machinery
industries has increased from 29% in 1976 to 36% in 1980 as a result of
SMIB's deliberate policy to support a subsector which has been singled out
by the Government as a high priority area with a key role in deepening
Korea's industrial structure. Likewise chemicals have increased from 9% in
1976 to 15% in 1980. SMIB's exposure in the sectors of mnachinery and
chemicals is in line with the share of these subsectors in SMI fixed capital
formation.
3.37      Geographic Distribution.  ln accordance with the objectives set in
its Development Strategy Statements, SMIB has achieved reasonable success in
diversifying the geographic distribution of its operations. The share of
commitments to projects in Seoul City has declined marginally from 33% of
equipment loans in 1978 to 31% in 1980; similarly Pusan City has declined
from 16% to 6%. With the aggregate share of these two urban areas having
declined from 49% to 37%, SMIB has reached its goal of limiting to 45% the
share of Seoul and Pusan in total lending./2 This decline has been compen-
sated by a significant increase in SMIB's lending to the Kyong Gi Province
which surrounds Seoul from 18% in 1978 to 27% in 1980. SMIB's lending
outside these three major industrial areas has marginally increased from 33%
to 36% during the same period. According to its Development Strategy
Statement for 1982-83 (Annex B, Appendix 4), SMIB intends to further
increase its lending outside these three areas to 40% by 1983. Despite some
scope for a further diversification of lending outside the Seoul area,
SMIB's operations are broadly in line with the regional distribution of SMI
fixed investment./3
3.38      Assistance to Smaller Enterprises.  The trend towards an increase
in the employment size of SMIB's borrowers which had been observed over the
period 1976-78 has been reversed in the past two years. The share in total
commitments of borrowers with more than 300 employees has declined from
10.7% in 1978 to 1.8% in 1980. Concurrently, the share of enterprises with
less than 100 employees has increased from 43% to 55%. The large share of
smaller firms (with less than 100 employees) in total lending shows that
SMIB, along with CNB, plays an important role in financing this segment of
the SMI sector. In terms of asset size of borrowers, the trend is upwards
with the weighted average increasing from W 260 million in 1978 to W 370
million in 1980. This 42% increase in the average asset size of borrowers
/1 Data on textile projects financed by SMIB still show a degree of
export orientation higher than average but the average fixed investment
cost per job created in the 35 projects financed by SMIB (through end
September 1980) under the third Bank loan was W 10.3 million compared to
an overall average of W 9.1 million.

of September 30, 1980, reflecting the past bias in SMIB's lending.

- 37 -
was however lower than inflation during that period and therefore repre-
sented a decline in real terms.  In contrast to 1978, when the asset size of
foreign exchange borrowers was nearly twice as large /1 as that of domestic
currency borrowers, the differential was only 20% in 1980 because of a
stagnation in the asset size of foreign currency borrowers.
3.39      These trends are also reflected in thae average size of SMIW's
domestic currency equipment loans which increased from W 17.4 million in
1978 to W 56.1 million in 1980 and in foreign currency equipment loans from
W 97.3 million ($200,000) in 1978 to W 129 million ($206,000) in 1980. The
rapid increase in the average size of domestic currency loans resulted from
a relaxation of the ceilings imposed by the Government on the size of loans.
No such ceiling exists on foreign currency loans;/2 the stagnation in the
average size of foreign currency loans reflects a deliberate effort on
SMIB's part to channel funds to smaller borrowers.
3.40      Employment Creation.  Data on the employment impact of SMIB
financing are only available for projects which received foreign currency
equipment loans (Annex B, Table 5)./3 It is estimated that, over the period
1978-80, such projects directly created about 15,000 jobs at an average
fixed investment cost per job of $15,100. The average fixed investment cost
per job created has increased rapidly from $8,900 in 1977 to $17,420 in 1979
/4 as a result both of inflation and of the higher capital intensity of
investment in Korea. Despite this trend, the average cost per job created
is only about one third of the projects financed by KDB and KLB at the
larger end of the industrial spectrum.
3.41      Annex B, Table 6 shows that the average fixed investment cost per
job created for subprojects financed under the third IBRD loan was
approximately $17,460. This average, however, conceals considerable differ-
ences in the ratios of individual projects financed by SMIB. Specifically,
SMIIB was required to earmark a $25 million component out of the third Bank
loan for financing small, labor intensive projects defined as (a) enter-
prises with fixed assets not exceeding $300,000 or (b) projects generating
employment at a fixed investment cost per job not greater than $8,500. By
end-1980, this objective ihad been substantially exceeded with 198 sub-
projects (out of 273) qualifying under the above criteria and with $32.2
million earmarked out of total loan approvals of $54.3 million.
/1  W 350 million as against W 180 million.
/2  Except for that imposed by lending agencies ($1.5 million under the
third IBRD Loan).
/3  A number of these projects also received domestic currency loans.
4  The same ratio for 1980 shows a marginal (7%) increase in the Won value
of investment cost per job.



- 33 -
3.42      Contribution to Exports.  Over the period 1973-76, the incremental
exports of projects receiving foreign currency loans was estimated at about
55% of sales. This ratio has declined steadily since 1977 and reached only
12% in 1979; in 1980, it increased to 25%. This degree of export orienta-
tion is lower than national aggregates which show the SMI sector accounting
for about 40% of manufactured exports; national figures however include
direct exports by manufacturers and indirect exports under subcontracting
arrangements. Data on SMIB financed projects show that the proportion of
SMI enterprises involved in direct export sales has declined and is
increasingly limited to companies exporting more than 50% of their output./l
Enterprises with a lower degree of export orientation increasingly market
their products through trading firms and larger industrial companies.
Although SMIB does not record export sales under subcontracting arrangement,
it does finance an increasing number of SMIs with linkages to larger,
export-oriented industries. Despite the apparent decline in its financing
of direct exportoriented projects, SMIB's support of exporting SMIs is
satisfactory.
D. Financial Position and Efficiency in Resource Mobilization
Financial Structure and Performance
3.43      Asset Structure.  SMIB's balance sheets for the years 1976 through
1980 /2 are summarized in Annex B, Table 7. As of September 30, 1980, total
assets amounted to W 1,256.6 billion (US$1.9 billion) following a steady
growth averaging 38% p.a. since 1976, well above the average annual rate of
inflation of about 20%. Current assets have retained a share of about 66%
of total assets over the past three years. SMIB's long-term portfolio
accounted for about one-third of total assets over the period 1978-80.
SMIB's total loan (short and long-term) portfolio has increased from 62% of
total assets in 1978 to 72% as of end-September 1980, as a result of the
rapid growth in working capital loans (from 39% of assets in 1978 to 48% in
1980).
3.44      Liabilities and Equity.  Of SMIB's total assets at end-September
1980, 61% were financed by current liabilities (46% by short-term deposits),
31% by long-term liabilities, and 8% by equity./3 This composition of SMIB's
/1 Companies exporting over 50% of their output accounted for 60% of SMIB's
lending to export oriented enterprises in 1978-79 and 82% in 1980.
/2 The 1980 balance sheet is prepared as of September 30, 1980 and is
unaudited.
(3  The part financed by equity appears higher than in previous years (3%
in 1979) because of the high undistributed earnings shown in the interim
balance sheet as of September 30, 1980.



- 39 -
resources has remained largely unchanged over the past three years. The
importance of demand and savings deposits in SMIB's total resources has
declined marginally from 64/ of total assets in 1978 to 61% in 198C but their
composition is unchanged with 75% short-term and 25% long-term. SMIB's
aggregate long-term liabilities have remained at about 33% of total assets
over the period 1978-80, witlh savings deposits accounting for 50%, foreign
currency borrowings for 32%, and government resources (such as NIF and
SMIPF) for 18%./l
3.45      As of December 31, 1980, SMIB's paid-in capital amounted to W 57.1
billion compared to W 27.1 billion at end-1979. Regular annual contributions
to SMIB's share capital /2 have been made by the government since 1976 in
accordance with an understanding reached under the first Bank loan to
provide SHIB with additional equity capital as needed to maintain its
long-term debt/equity ratio within the limit of 10:1 without constraining
its ability to raise long-term resources.  SMIB's long-term debt/equity
ratio which stood at 9.2:1 at end-1979 had declined to 5.2:1 at end-1980.
The total debt/equity ratio also declined from 29.9:1 in 1979 to 19.1:1 at
end-1980 which is not excessive for an institution heavily involved in
commercial banking and deriving a large part of its resources from deposits.
The current ratio has remained somewhat above one since 1976, which is
satisfactory. SMIB's short-term liquidity is controlled by the BOK's
reserve requirements and is under the supervision of the Superintendent of
Banks.  SMIB's debt service coverage ratio was 1.12 in 1979 and 1.22 in
1980, which is adequate.
3.46      Earnings Performance.  SMIB's income, cash flow statements and
indicators of financial performance are summarized in Annex B, Tables 8 and 9.
Interest income on loans outstanding accounted for about 80% of SMIB's
gross income over the period 1978-80; fees and commissions provided the bal-
ance.  Income from equipment loans accounted for an average of 25% of SMIB's
total interest income, substantially less than the 33% share of equipment
loans in total loan portfolio. This results from the lower nominal interest
rate charged on foreign currency loans relative to domestic currency
loans./3 SMIB's net income totaled W 1.1 billion in 1979 and W 8.9 billion
in 1980.  SMIB's profitability has been modest in 1978-79 with net income
representing only 0.1% of average total assets; it has increased
substantially in 1980 as a result of the higher interest spread brought
about by the changes in Korea's interest rate structure (para. 2.34). Net
/1  It should be noted however that KFX funds borrowings although classified
as current liabilities are used to finance long-term loans.
/2  A further contribution of W 50 billion is expected in 1981.
/3  Interest income on foreign currency loans was 8.2% of total interest
income in 1980 compared to the 18% share of these loans in SMIB's total
loan portfolio.



- 40 -
income as a percentage of equity has increased from 3.3% in 1978 to 3.6% in
1979./l Administrative expenses have been kept under control and actually
show a satisfactory decline relative to total assets (from 3.3% in 1978 to
3.1% in 1979). SMIB is required to pay dividends on the share capital
subscribed by the Government at the rate of one percent of outstanding
subscriptions. The dividend payout ratio was 22% of net profits in 1979.
3.47      Quality of Portfolio.  SMIB's loan collection performance and
arrears position are summarized in Annex B, Tables 10 and 11. The portfolio
of SMIB is of unusually good quality considering that the institution oper-
ates in the high risk small and medium business sector, and that its port-
folio comprises some 20,000 clients with 77,500 accounts outstanding. As of
September 30, 1980, 642 clients were in arrears with overdue payments of
principal and interest amounting to W 22.8 billion; 51% of that amount had
been in arrears for less than 3 months and only 9% for more than 12 months.
Total arrears accounted for 2.5% of total outstanding loans, a slight
deterioration compared to 1.6% and 1.1% at end 1978 and 1979 respectively.
Arrears on long-term equipment loans accounted for 21% /2 of total arrears
and 1.6% of outstanding long-term loans; arrears on working capital loans
represented 79% of total arrears and 3.0% of outstanding working capital
loans. SMIB's collection performance is highly satisfactory although
slightly better for working capital loans /3 (99.3%) than for equipment
loans (92% for domestic currency and 94% for foreign currency loans).
Outstanding loans affected by arrears accounted for only 3% of the end
September 1980 loan portfolio but this represented a significant deterior-
ation over the end-1978 level of 1.7%. The sectoral distribution of arrears
is broadly in line with the sectoral composition of SMIB's loan portfolio.
The textiles and machinery subsectors accounted for 57.2% of the portfolio
affected by arrears, marginally higher than their aggregate share of 49.7%
of the loan portfolio. SMIB has achieved a very satisfactory performance in
debt collection while keeping reschedulings to a minimum./4 The slight
deterioration in the quality of SMIB's portfolio in 1980 resulted from the
recession which affected the Korean economy in 1979-80.
/1 And 23.7% of equity in 1980 on the basis of provisional accounts.
/2 Compared to a 33% share of equipment loans in SMIB's loan portfolio.
/3 The apparent contradiction between collection performance and incidence
of arrears comes from the fact that working capital loan collections are
in a ratio of 5.5 times to outstanding loans.
/4 Only three equipment loans have been rescheduled in 1980.



- 41 -
3.48      SMIB's generally good arrears position and collection performance
result from its well developed supervision and collection procedures. They
are also attributable to the peculiarities of the Korean financial system in
which a number of efficiently operating institutions assist banks in mini-
mizing loan losses. This system comprises the Credit Guarantee Fund,/l the
Loan Readjustment Corporation which processes loan foreclosures on behalf of
financial instiLtutions /2 and a credit information system operated by the
Bank of Korea. Finally, SMIB follows the practice of commercial banks in
Korea of requiring that borrowers open a savings account when they receive
loans. Aside from increasing the resources of financial institutions, this
practice allows the transfer of all or part of the deposit balances to cover
overdue loan installments. However, the main factor behind the soundness of
SMIB's portfolio is the good performance of Korean industry until 1979. The
economic slowdown of 1979-80 and the rapid depreciation of the Wlon in 1980
may result in some deterioration of SMIB's portfolio in coming months.
3.49      Provisions.  The SMIB Act requires that 25% of annual net profits
be set aside as an equity reserve covering loan losses. Because of the low
level of net profits, actual appropriations have exceeded this requirement
in the past five years and cumulative reserves amounted to W 4.0 billion at
end-1979. At the same time, SMIB makes annual provisions for doubtful
accounts on the basis of actual write-offs in the preceding year./3 The
provision allowance reached only W 383 million in 1979.  At end-1979
reserves for loan losses and cumulative provisions reached W 4.7 billion or
only 0.7% of the total loan portfolio. SMIB's external auditors, however,
considered that this low level of provisions was adequate in view of the
satisfactory level of arrears. The recent increase in the incidence of
arrears probably justified a higher level of provisions for 1980-81 and
SMIB, accordingly, has made a provision allowance of W 6.9 billion in 1980.
3.50      Audit.  In 1977, SMIB appointed San Kyong & Company as its new
auditors, a company acceptable to the Bank. The 1979 audit report found
SMIB's accounts satisfactory but repeated a minor qualification made in
previous reports pointing out that the employees' retirement liability had
been underestimated.
/1 In the first nine months of 1980, SMIB collected W 1.9 billion from KCGF
compared to W 1.2 billion in 1979.
/2  Transfers to the Readjustment Corporation reached W 10.4 billion in the
first nine months of 1980 compared to W 4.3 billion in 1979.
/3 It had been agreed at the time of negotiations of the first Bank Loan
that cumulative provisions should be allowed to build up to a level
exceeding actual write-offs. SMIB has complied with this requirement
until 1977. In 1978, however, provisions were reduced by W 858 million
(largely as a means of increasing net income).



- 42 -
Resource Mobilization
3.51      In the Korean context, where demand for funds exceeds available
supply, SMIB's ability to mobilize increasing amounts of foreign and
domestic currency resources has been a determining factor of its efficiency
as a financial intermediary. SMIB's efficiency in resource mobilization has
been very satisfactory over the period 1977-80 with total resources
(domestic and foreign) increasing at an average rate of 40% p.a., thus
allowing the loan portfolio to grow at approximately the same rate. SMIB's
resource position over the period 1978-80 is shown in Annex B, Table 12.
The mix of foreign and domestic resources has remained in a ratio of 20:80
which was adequate and was reflected in the share of foreign currency loans
in SMIB's loan portfolio.
3.52      As of September 30, 1980, SMIB's total resources amounted to
W 1,290 billion ($1.98 billion) of which domestic currency resources
accounted for W 1,039 billion and foreign currency resources for W 251 bil-
lion equivalent. The share of long-term resources in total domestic cur-
rency resources has remained stable at about 33% over the period 1978-80,
reflecting the high proportion of short-term deposits in SMIB's total
resources. The weight of short-term funds in total resources effectively
constrained SMIB's ability to supply larger amounts of long-term equipment
loans. Except in 1978,/l SMIB has not undertaken any term transformation of
funds whereby short-term resources are used to finance long-term lending
operations./2 Within the limits of financial prudence, term transformation
of part of its short-term resources would allow SMIB to increase its term
lending. Even without recourse to using short-term resources, SMIB could
increase the share of equipment lending in its total "long-term" /3 lending
operations by reducing the share of medium term working capital operations.
Only 51% of SMIB's outstanding "long-term" loans at end September 1980 were
for equipment financing with the balance of 49% being medium-term working
capital loans.
/1  With a negative figure of W 0.4 billion shown in the 1978 resource
statement as resources available for future disbursements.
/2  The weighted average maturity of SMIB's deposits was approximately
10 months as of end September 1980; to the extent that SMIB's equipment
loans whose average maturity was about 5.5 years in 1979/80 are financed
from deposit resources, SMIB does undertake some term transformation
by stretching the maturities of its deposits to cover long-term
lending.
/3 Long-term loans are defined as loans with a maturity exceeding one
year.



- 43 -
3.53      Domestic Currency Resources.  Unlike several government-owned
financial institutions in Korea, SMIB is not overly dependent on the
Government for its domestic currency resources. A major part of SMIB's
domestic currency resources is mobilized independently in the form of
deposits thus contributing to the mobilization of domestic savings.
Resource statements show that equity resources (mainly in the form of
government subscriptions to SMIB's share capital) accounted for 4% to 5% of
total domestic resources in the period 1976-80.
3.54      Other government resources supplied to SMIB comprise essentially
the National Investment Fund (NIF), the SMI Promotion Fund and short-term
borrowings from the Bank of Korea./l These government funds have increased
marginally their share of SMIB-s total domestic currency liabilities from
11% in 1978 to 15.5% in 1980. Concurrently, SMIB's deposit resources have
declined in relative terms from 89% of total domestic currency borrowings in
1978 to 84.5% in 1980. While SMIB has satisfactorily kept direct financial
support from the Government at a relatively low level in the past few years,
its efficiency in mobilizing deposit resources independently from the
Government has declined marginally in recent years. SMIB's total deposits
at end-1980 amounted to W 823.4 billion compared to a target of W 873.1
billion. The slow growth in SMIB's deposit resources coupled with the need
to increase the availability of long-term domestic resources in order to
expand equipment lending suggest the need for SMIB to start tapping
alternative sources of long-term domestic currency resources. In spite of
the relatively high effective cost of such resources,/2 debentures offer
good prospects. SMIB is authorized by its charter to issue debentures with
or without government guarantees. During negotiations it was agreed that
SMIB would take all necessary measures to increase its local currency
resources, including, inter alia, issuing debentures.
3.55      Foreign Currency Resources.  Starting with a first foreign
currency borrowing of Deutsche Mark 15 million from KfW in 1965, SMIB has
gradually broadened the source of its foreign currency resources to USAID,
OECF, ADB, the Exim Bank of Japan and IBRD since 1975. By end-September
1978, SMIB had mobilized a cumulative total of $401.6 million, of which 31%
were from ADB and 36% from IBRD (Annex B, Table 13). Apart from its
borrowings from official sources, since 1976 SMIB has been channelling
foreign exchange resources under the Korea Foreign Exchange (KFX) scheme
sponsored by the Government. The KFX scheme is funded with the foreign

exchange reserves of the Bank of Korea and is supervised by NIOF. Through
end-September 1980, SMIB had received $75.3 million from KFX, about 19% of
its total foreign exchange resources. KFX funds are onlent at a floating
rate of LIBOR + 1% to 1.25% depending on loan maturity.  At end September
1980, SMIB had $21.5 million available for future commitments. SMIB has
since obtained a third line of credit from KfW of about $4.2 million and a
sixth loan of $40 million from ADB. Based on projected operations, these
foreign currency resources should cover commitments through the third
quarter of 1981.
3.56      Although SMIB has been successful in mobilizing increasing amounts
of foreign currency resources over the past five years, ADB and IBRD lending
are now levelling off at $40 million and $60 million respectively Similarly
KFX funds which accounted for 29% of SMIB-s foreign currency disbursements
over 1978-80 have been discontinued in 1980 because of Korea's balance of
payments difficulties. Although SMIB expects its approvals of foreign
currency equipment loans to be lower in 1980/81 than the historical levels
of 1978/79,/l a substantial build up is projected from $65 million in 1981
to $117 million in 1984. Alternative sources of foreign exchange need to be
identified to support this level of lending (para. 3.60).
E. Prospects and Resource Requirements
Business Prospects
3.57      Following a decline of 5.7% in 1980, GNP is expected to increase
by 5.5% in 1981 and 8% in real terms during the Fifth Five Year Plan period
1982-86. Fixed capital formation is expected to grow at 4% in real terms in
1981 and 8% during the Plan Period. SMIB estimates that SMI investment will
increase in nominal terms by 19% in 1981 and 15% thereafter, a modest
increase in real terms in view of expected inflation./2
3.58      Within the limits of expected resource availability, SMIB has pre-
pared operational projections for the period 1981-85 (Annex B, Table 14).
The assumptions underlying these projections are generally reasonable.
SMIB-s disbursements of equipment loans are projected to remain at the
historical level of 11% of fixed capital formation in the SMI sector. In
line with recent trends, foreign currency lending is expected to account for
an average of 30% of total commitments of equipment loans. Deposit
/1 With respectively $75 million and $95 million.
/2 The GNP deflator is projected to reach 19.3% in 1981 and 12.2% in 1982.



- 45 -
resources are expected to grow at a rate of 27% p.a., higher than the 22%
growth of 1980 but substantially less than in the period 1977-79 /1.  Total
cumulative commitments (working capital /2 and equipment loans) are expected
to reach W 2,852 billion over the five year period with foreign loan
commitments amounting to $509 million, 11.8% of the total. The annual
increase in net working capital loans is projected at 22% and at 15% for
equipment loans. Achievement of these targets will depend primarily on
SMIB's ability to mobilize additional resources, particularly long-term
domestic and foreign currency funds.
Resource Requirements
3.59      SMIB's resource requirements are shown in Annex B, Table 17.
Cumulative domestic currency commitments over 1981-85 are expected to reach
W 2,516 billion, consisting of W 811 billion for equipment loans and W 1,705
billion for working capital loans.  In addition to its loan collections,
SMIB expects to raise a total W 2,425 billion to meet these commitments.
Long-term resources would amount to W 1,051 billion with government
subscriptions to SMIB's share capital accounting for 14%, government funds
for 33% and long-term deposits for 53%. Short-term resources would be
mobilized from deposits (W 950 billion) and from BOK's rediscounting
facility (W 424 billion). SMIB's plans for increasing its long-term
domestic currency resources through issuance of debentures were discussed at
negotiations. It was agreed that while the long-term interests of SMIB and
the Korean economy would be served by SMIB entering the bond market, as this
would both help to diversify SMIB's domestic currency resources and
contribute to increasing domestic savings, SMIB first needed to undertake a
review of the implications of and constraints to entering the bond market
before deciding on the level or timing of issuing its bonds.  This review is
to be completed by December 31, 1981 and by March 31, 1982, SMIB will first
inform the Bank of measures to be taken to enable SMIB to issue debentures,
and will secondly consult with the Bank about the proposed timing of issue.
3.60      SMIB is planning to mobilize $490 million in foreign currency over
the period 1981-85 in addition to the $57.1 million available at end 1980.
Borrowings from IBRD would account for 45% and ADB for 31X. SMIB has
projected a resumption of KFX borrowings in 1982 but this is unlikely to
materialize. The nonavailability of KFX funds would leave a gap of $120
million in SMIB's resource mobilization plan. SMIB might need to curtail
substantially its projected lending operations unless alternative sources of
foreign currency resources are developed. As its needs for foreign exchange
/1 The share of long-term savings deposits is estimated at about 32% which
is too high relative to past experience (about 25X).
/2 With working capital loans on a net incremental basis.



- 46 -
are growing and its access to Government foreign exchange resources might
he limited in the future compared to its needs, SMIB should now initiate
steps to forge new links with the international capital market. Although
SMIB has not approached foreign commercial lenders yet, prospects for such
borrowings appear to be favorable. SMIB would need to borrow relatively
limited amounts at first so as to establish its name in capital markets and
to build up a steady supply of foreign exchange. Availability of resources
will be a major constraint on SMIB's ability to fulfill its operational
objectives. SMIB's plans for initiating discussions with foreign commercial
lenders were discussed at negotiations and its Development Strategy
Statement for 1982-83 was amended to reflect SMIB's intention of mobilizing
additional foreign currency financing from commercial sources (Annex B,
Appendix 4).
Financial Forecasts
3.61      SMIB-s financial performance and structure are expected to remain
satisfactory over the next five years (Annex B, Tables 15 and 16). Net income
is projected to grow from W 12.7 billion in 1980 to W 35 billion in 1985,
a slight decline from 1% of assets to 0.8% resulting from a narrowing of
the interest spread from 5.8% to 4.4%. Interest income would increase as a
share of gross income from 80% in 1980 to 88% in 1985.
3.62      SMIB-s total assets are projected to increase from W 1,411 billion
in 1980 to W 4,597 billion in 1985, an average annual growth of about 27%.
SMIB's loan portfolio would retain a share of about 72% of total assets
throughout the projection period. Ratios of financial structure and
performance show a satisfactory and improving trend. Due to projected
increases in SMIB-s share capital, the long-term debt/equity ratio would
decline from 4.9:1 in 1980 to 3.3:1 in 1983 and would gradually increase
thereafter. The ratio would remain within the contractual limit of 10:1
throughout the period 1981-84. The current ratio would remain at a
satisfactory level of about 1.1 and the debt coverage ratio would increase
marginally to 1.9 times which is adequate.
4. THE PROPOSED BANK LOAN
Project Objectives
4.01      Continued support of the SMI sector remains an important element
in Korea's industrial development strategy in view of the sector's
contribution to employment creation, regional dispersal of industry and
growth of manufactured exports. However, Korea's comparative advantage in
the production of labor-intensive light manufactured goods, on which the
SMI sector was heavily dependent, has eroded rapidly in the seventies.
This erosion was due to rising labor costs in Korea and to the emergence of
efficient competitors in world markets. In view of this changing cost
structure, Korea's recent industrial strategy has emphasized skill and
te_hOlaGZ A3            m-t'  with ptio-ity placed on. large industry in the
a)location of scarce capital and human skills.  With hindsight, it appears



- 47 -
that this industr:Lal strategy has not sufficiently allowed the SMI sector to
increase productivity and to improve quality of output through capital
investment. Labor costs have also increased rapidly in the SMI sector with
rising demand for skilled labor in large industry thus reducing further the
profitability and competitiveness of SMI products.
4.02      Recent government policies and incentives in the SMI sector tend
to increase the protection of SMI enterprises against competition from more
efficient producers rather than improving the competitiveness of the sector
through capital investment and betterment of skills. With the latter
objective in the forefront, the proposed project would (a) augment SMIB's
capability to provide long-term investment capital for improving SMI
production technologies; (b) aim at improving investment in upgrading human
skills through a comprehensive program of action aimed at reorganizing and
improving the efficiency of extension services in Korea; and (c) improve
further the institutional capability of SMIB by strengthening its efficiency
in resource mobilization and allocation.
Project Benefits
4.03      The proposed loan of $60 million is expected to finance approxi-
mately 39% of SMIB's projected foreign currency commitments over the twoyear
period mid-1981 to mid-1983. The Bank loan is expected to help finance
approximately 250 subprojects and to create approximately 5,000 new jobs at
an average fixed investment cost per job of about $20,000. The benefits to
be derived from the proposed loan can be gauged in the light of SMIB's
performance in allocating resources under the previous Bank loans (Annex B,
Table 6).
4.04      SMIB's satisfactory operational capabilities in the areas of
project appraisal and supervision have enabled it to operate as an efficient
allocator of Bank resources to the SMI sector. As of end October 1980, SMIB
had allocated total Bank resources of $130.6 million to 616 subprojects.
Under the third Bank loan (1749-KO) alone, $45.9 million had been allocated
to 247 subprojects representing a total investment cost of $90 million
equivalent.
4.05      As expected at the time of appraisal, Bank resources under
Loan-1749 have been used by SMIB to finance relatively small,
labor-intensive projects. Subloans ranged in size from $27,000 to $1.5
million with an average of $185,700. The average asset size of applicants
was W 294 million ($564,000) and average employment at the time of application
was 70 persons. The sectoral distribution of subloans was satisfactorily
diversified with manufacturing accounting for 80% of total approvals,
transportation for 7%, construction for 4% and the remainder allocated to
other manufacturing activities. Textiles and machinery accounted for 25%
each of manufacturing sector loans. The regional distribution of subloans
was also satisfactory with Seoul and Pusan accounting for 28.5% of the total



- 48 -
allocated funds.  Only 17% of the total number of subprojects had any export
sales but export-oriented projects were expected to export an average of 58%
($38 million) of their annual output. The direct employment impact of the
subprojects was estimated by SMIB at 4,250 new jobs with a fixed investment
cost per job ranging from $1,120 (metal working) to $261,500 (ship repair)
with an average of $17,500. Calculations of rates of return for a limited
sample of subprojects showed a range of 18.9% to 25.7% for the FRR and
substantially higher economic benefits with a range of 29.2% to 48.3%.
Weighted average rates of return were respectively 21% for the FR& and 36.4%
for the ERR. The subprojects to be financed under the proposed loan are
expected to yield similar benefits although the emphasis now being placed on
modernization and higher productivity may lead to the financing of
relatively larger and capital-intensive projects. The proposed project does
not entail any unusual risk.
Main Features of the Loan
4.06      Purpose.  As with previous Bank loans to SMIB, the proposed loan
would be used to finance (a) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of directly
imported goods and services; and (b) 60% of the cost in domestic currency
(representing the estimated foreign exchange component) of locally
manufactured or procured machinery and equipment./l
4.07      Eligibility Criteria.  Previous Bank loans to SMIB emphasized
labor-intensive investment and accordingly, eligibility of subborrowers
was defined in terms of maximum asset size of applicants (W 1 billion under
Loans 1507-KO and 1749-KO). Current objectives in the SMI sector are not
solely related to employment intensity, but, even more importantly, are aimed
at increasing productivity and efficiency. Under the proposed loan,
eligibility of subborrowers would be defined in terms of maximum size of
employment in order to reflect this change of priorities and to allow more
flexibility in financing projects which could be relatively capital-
intensive. SMIB's own definition of 300 employees would be retained except
for activities designated by the Government under the Small and Medium
Industry Promotion law for which the limit has been raised to 500 employees
(i.e., automobile and bicycle parts, electronics, pottery, etc.).
4.08      Subloan Ceiling.  In recognition of the greater funding require-
ments of some modernization investments, the ceiling on individual subloans
would be raised from $1.5 million under the third loan to $2 million. with
an average of $17,500. Calculations of rates of return for a limited sample
of subprojects showed a range of 18.9% to 25.7% for the FRR and substan-
tially higher economic benefits with a range of 29.2% to 48.3%. Weighted
average rates of return were respectively 21% for the FRR and 36.4% for the

for the FRR and 36.4% for the ERR.  The subprojects to be financed under the
proposed loan are expected to yield similar benefits although the emphasis
now being placed on modernization and higher productivity may lead to the
financing of relatively larger and capital-intensive projects. The proposed
project does not entail any unusual risk.
Main Features of the Loan
4.06      Purpose.  As with previous Bank loans to SMIB, the proposed loan
would be used to finance (a) 100% of the foreign exchange cost of directly
imported goods and services; and (b) 60% of the cost in domestic currency
(representing the estimated foreign exchange component) of locally
manufactured or procured machinery and equipment./l
4.07      Eligibility Criteria.  Previous Bank loans to SMIB emphasized
labor-intensive investment and accordingly, eligibility of subborrowers
was defined in terms of maximum asset size of applicants (W I billion under
Loans 1507-K0 and 1749-K0).  Current objectives in the SMI sector are not
solely related to employment intensity, but, even more importantly, are aimed
at increasing productivity and efficiency. Under the proposed loan,
eligibility of subborrowers would be defined in terms of maximum size of
employment in order to reflect this change of priorities and to allow more
flexibility in financing projects which could be relatively capital-
intensive. SMIB's own definition of 300 employees would be retained except
for activities designated by the Government under the Small and Medium
Industry Promotion law for which the limit has been raised to 500 employees
(i.e., automobile and bicycle parts, electronics, pottery, etc.).
4.08      Subloan Ceiling.  In recognition of the greater funding require-
ments of some modernization investments, the ceiling on individual subloans
would be raised to $2 million.
4.09       Free Limit.  It is recommended that the free limit of $0.5 million
remain unchanged. This limit is expected to result in the submission to the
Bank of about ten subprojects (accounting for approximately 15% of the total
loan amount) for detailed review prior to approval.
4.10      Debt/Equity Limit.  The Government's commitment to increase its
subscriptions to SMIB's share capital as needed to maintain the long-term
debt/equity ratio within a limit of 10:1 had been recorded in the Guarantee
Agreements of previous Bank loans. The Government has complied with this
covenant. This maximum long-term debt/equity limit will remain unchanged
under the proposed loan.
/1 About 5% of the third Bank loan has been used by SMIB to finance
domestically procured equipment.



- 50 -
4.11      Relending Rate.  In accordance with MOF lending guidelines, SMIB
has been onlending the proceeds of its foreign currency borrowings from
official sources by adding a uniform interest spread of two percentage
points above its own borrowing rates and with the foreign exchange risk
passed on to subborrowers.  The 2% interest spread is adequate to cover the
cost incurred by SMIB in processing subloan applications and is in line with
the practice of other development finance institutions in Korea. Under the
proposed Bank loan, the relending rate to subborrowers would be 11.6% p.a.
4.12      Based on the lending rate of 7.9% charged by the Bank under the
second and third loans to SMIB, the subborrowers were charged an interest
rate of 9.9% p.a./l In addition to US dollars, the currencies disbursed by
the Bank comprised a sizeable proportion of "hard" currencies; in aggregate,
disbursements of Yen, Deutsche Mark, and Swiss Francs accounted for 50% to
87% of total disbursements under the three Bank loans./2 The foreign
exchange risk assumed by SMIB's subborrowers therefore comprised (a) a cross
currency foreign exchange risk between the "hard" currencies disbursed by the
Bank and the US dollar; and (b) a foreign exchange risk between the US dollar
and the Won. The depreciation of the US dollar against the "hard" currencies
and of the Won against the US dollar in the period 1976-80 has increased the
effective borrowing cost to subborrowers well above the nominal interest rate
as shown below:
Loan             Loan               Loan
1175-KO          1507-KO            1749-KO
Nominal borrowing rate (%)            10.5              9.9                9.9
Effective borrowing rate (%)
US$ basis                          17.9               8.6/a            13.4
Won basis                          23.5              21.7              21.7
/a The lower effective borrowing cost in US dollars resulted from the
appreciation of the US dollar relative to the Yen and Swiss Franc over
the disbursement period (1978-80).
/1 Under the first Bank loan SMIB's borrowing cost was 8.5% p.a. and the
relending rate 10.5%.
third loan.



- 51 -
The above table shows that the average effective cost of Bank resources has
not been unduly subsidized relative to SMIB's domestic currency loans; the
standard lending rate for domestic currency long-term loans has fluctuated
between 20% and 25% p.a. during the period 1978-80. While foreign exchange
fluctuations in the eighties may not be as wide as in the late seventies,
the effective relending rate of Bank funds under the proposed loan is
expected to exceed substantially the nominal rate of 11.6% p.a. Under pre-
vious Bank loans, the Bank's disbursement practices resulted in wide distor-
tions among subborrowers as the mix of currencies disbursed varied from
subborrower to subborrower, causing wide differentials in the exchange risk
and therefore in the effective interest cost of individual subborrowers.
The currency pooling system will remedy this deficiency by equalizing the
foreign exchange risk among subborrowers.  SMIB is currently in the process
of drafting, with the help of its legal counsel, new legal documents
(between SMIB and its subborrowers), to accommodate the introduction of the
currency pooling system.
4.13      Amortization Schedule.  As is usual with Bank loans to DFCs, the
proposed loan would have an adjustable composite amortization schedule
reflecting the aggregate amortization schedules of the subloans made by
SMIB. The proposed loan will be fully repaid within 15 years including a
grace period of 3 years. Individual subloans would have a maximum maturity
of 13 years incLuding a grace period of three years. The estimated
disbursement schedule of the proposed loan is shown in Annex B, Table 19.
Agreements and Understandings Reached at Negotiations
4.14      The following agreements and understandings were reached with the
Korean Government during negotiations:
(a) the Government will continue to provide SMIB with additional
equity as needed in the future to maintain SMIB's long-term debt-
equity ratio within a limit of 10:1 and to allow a satisfactory
expansion of SMIB's mobilization of long-term domestic and foreign
currency resources (para. 4.10);
(b)  a comprehensive study of extension services for SMI would be
carried out by the Government according to the terms of reference
agreed upon at negotiations. Upon completion of the study (by
December 31, 1981), the Government would consult with the Bank on
its recommendations and agreement would be sought on a program of
action aimed at reorganizing extension services. The cost of the
study would be borne by the Government (para. 2.15).
4.15      The following agreements were reached with SMIB and recorded
in the loan documents:



- 52 -
(a) a long-term debt/equity limit of 10:1 would be maintained by
SMIB (para. 4.10);
(b) the free limit on subloans would be maintained at $0.5 million
(para. 4.09);
(c) eligible subborrowers would be defined as applicant enterprises
with a maximum size of employment of 300 persons, except for
activities defined in attachment No. I of the Presidential Decree
No. 9,370 dated March 10, 1979 enforcing the Small and Medium
Industry Promotion Act for which the maximum size of employment
would be 50U persons (para. 4.07);
(d) a ceiling of $2 million would be applied to individual subloans
(para. 4.08);
(e) SMIB would take all necessary measures to increase local
currency resources including, inter alia, issuing debentures
(para. 3.54); and
(f) SMIB's procurement procedures would be modified so as to ensure
that an adequate degree of competition is ensured in all cases in
the procurement of equipment. For subprojects above the free
limit, the appraisal report would review the need for applying
international competitive bidding (para. 3.24).
4.16      In addition, the Bank reviewed and reached understandings with
SMIB on the following points:
(a) SMIB would undertake a comprehensive training program aimed
at improving the capability of its staff in project appraisal.
The timetable and scope of the program was agreed upon at
at negotiations; implementation would be monitored by the
Bank (para. 3.17);
(b) SMIB would undertake a review of the implications of and
constraints to entering the domestic bond market which would be
completed by December 31, 1981. By March 31, 1982, SMIB will
inform the Bank of the measures to be taken to enable SMIB to
issue debentures and will consult with the Bank about the proposed
timing of issue (para. 3.59); and
(c) SMIB would amend its Development Strategy Statement for 1982/83
to reflect its intention to diversify its long-term foreign
currency resources by mobilizing funds from the international
capital market (para. 3.60).
4.17      Recommendation.  A Bank loan of $60 million with a maturity of 15

Terms of Reference of a Study of SMI Extension Services in Korea
Background
The Korean Government is currently in the process of formulating a
ten year development plan for the SMI sector which aims at increasing the
contribution made by that sector to the country's overall economic development
objectives. To this end, the Government intends to conduct a comprehensive
study of the legislative, institutional and financial framework which supports
the SMI sector. This study, which is expected to be completed by December 31,
1981 would comprise inter alia a detailed review of the shortcomings of the
present institutional arrangements for providing technical guidance to SMI
enterprises through government agencies and would formulate recommendations
aimed at improving the efficiency of these arrangements and at increasing
their responsiveness to the needs of the sector. Both the Government and the
World Bank consider that a more efficient system of technical assistance is
essential to supplement the financial assistance channelled through the
financial system in support of increased productivity and improved quality of
output in the SMI sector. In view of this common concern, it was therefore
agreed between the Government and the Bank that the proposed technical
assistance review would be carried in accordance with the following terms of
reference.
1. Technical Assistance Objectives and Requirements
The objectives of the system of provision of technical assistance
need to be formulated with reference to the Government's broad objectives in
the SMI sector. It is assumed that, because of the high cost of an efficient
technical assistance system, the Government may wish to concentrate its
efforts on subsectors and enterprises which show the greatest growth potential
and which are Likely to contribute to rapid economic development. the issue
is for the Government to decide whether the system can reasonably be expected
to cover the whole SMI population or whether a more selective approach is
justified, at least in the beginning. The definition of the target group
should enable a detailed analysis of the requirements of the potential
clientele, i.e., managerial services (bookkeeping, cost accounting, financial
plans) and technological services (engineering skills to support particular
branches of industry).

2. Diagnosis
In the past two years, the establishment of the SMI Promotion
Cooperation and the designation by the Government of authorized technical
assistance agencies has introduced considerable changes in the role and
performance requirements of the institutions involved in the delivery of
technical extension services. The study should review the actual performance
of each individual agency over the past two years, in relation to their
annual plan of operations; their ability to deliver services, particularly
through on-site visits, which adequately answer the needs of the potential
clientele; the quality of these services; and the adequacy of their staff
(both in terms of qualifications and staff size), account being taken of the
fact that a number of these agencies employ only a limited part of their
personnel to service the SMI sector. Having reviewed each individual agency,
the study should attempt to identify the areas (e.g., managerial versus
technical advice or the particular industrial subsectors) in which these
agencies have greater intrinsic strength and areas in which performance is
unsatisfactory. The study should then assess the extent to which the various
technical agencies coordinate their activities so as to answer the needs of
the SMI sector in an effective manner. A diagnostic summary of the
constraints and shortcomings of each institution and of the overall technical
assistance delivery system should conclude this review of the present
institutional set up.
3. Institutional Arrangements
The study should outline the merits and demerits of various alter-
natives aimed at providing a coordinated system of technical assistance ser-
vices. Two main alternatives ought to be considered: first, the possibility
of concentrating within a single institution the complete range of services
and skills required to support the objectives defined above; second, it may be
desirable to opt for a system of agencies specialized in either managerial or
technological aspects and possibly in specific technological problems related
to particular subsectors of industry. The second alternative obviously calls
for some kind of apex coordinating agency (such as SMIPC) which may not be
directly involved in the delivery of technical assistance to individual
enterprises but which can act as a planning, coordinating and training agency
(for training of extension officers and possibly for SMI entrepreneurs and
their employees.) The decision to recommend a particular alternative for
institutional reorganization ought to be based on the review of individual
institutions proposed in the second part of this study which is expected to
identify the strengths and weaknesses of each agency.
4. Staffing
The high cost of technical assistance services is due in part to
the large number of extension staff required and the variety of skills
needed. The study ought to review the comparative advantages of relying on
technical agents employed full time by the agency(ies) delivering technical

assistance and/or of hiring consultants employed by other agencies
or by the private sector (including large industry) to perform specific
technical assistance assignments. Availability of skills, continuity of
employment and comparative costs are some of the elements which could be
considered in this review.
5. Cost Recovery
The study ought to ascertain the feasibility of charging fees, real
or nominal, for the provision of quality services to potential clients.

KOREA
ThE SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK
Outline of Development Strategy for 1980/81 /1
In parallel with the projected expansion of its financing
operations in the two-year period 198U/81, SMIB will endeavor to enhance its
impact on the Small and Medium Industry sector through the implementation of
the developmental objectives outlined below.
(a) It is SMIB's policy and intention, apart from financing medium-
sized enterprises (as presently defined) to make special efforts
to seek out and assist an increasing number of small enterprises
(in terms of total assets) and relatively labor-intensive projects
(in terms of the capital:labor ratio). This emphasis on financing
small, relatively labor-intensive projects will apply to the use
by SMIB of IBRD resources as well as its other resources.
(b) SMI-B will endeavor to increase the mobilization of household and
to storeholder savings, particularly emphasizing relatively
long-term deposits, in an effort to augment its domestic currency
resources. This is intended to be in part achieved by expanding
its branch network.
(c) SMIB will continue to gradually increase the proportion of its
financing to areas outside metropolitan Seoul and Busan in an
effort to promote a more even distribution of industry and employ-
ment opportunities in Korea. SMIB will endeavor to reduce the
proportion of Seoul and Busan to about 45% for the 1980/81 period.
(d) SMIB will actively assist the small and medium-sized enterprises in
the machinery subsector which has been specified as a high
priority subsector by the Government in the Fourth Five-Year Plan.
(e) In connection with (d) and (a), and in an effort to deepen the
industrial structure in Korea, SMIB will, where appropriate,
actively encourage and promote subcontracting arrangements.
(f) SMIB will continue to give high priority in its financial and
technical assistance to small rural industries within the Saemaeul
Program.
(g) SMIB will strengthen its research activities, with particular
emphasis on sector and market studies for small and medium-sized
industries, and will consistently apply the findings of these
studies in its operations.
/1 The previous Development Strategy agreed between the Bank and SMIB
covered the two-year period 1978/79.

THE SMALL AND JEDIUJM INDUSTRY BANK
Outline of Development Strategy for 1982-83
SMIB will endeavor to enhance its impact on the Small and Medium
Industry Sector through the implementation of the development objectives
outlined below:
(a)  It is SMIB's policy and intention to continue to make special
efforts to seek out and assist an increasing number of small
(as opposed to medium size) and relatively labor-intensive
projects. In addition, however, SMIB, recognizing the need to
improve the productivity and quality of output of the SfII sector in
order to increase its competitiveness, particularly in export
markets, will place increased emphasis on providing finance for
modernization through capital investments.
(b)  SMIB will pursue further its efforts at mobilization of deposits
from the household and corporate sectors with particular emphasis
on long-term savings deposits. In an attempt to increase its
medium- and long-term domestic currency resources and to contribute
to increasing domestic savings in the country, SMIB in a supple-
mental letter to the Bank dated .................... has agreed to
consider the possibility and future timing of issuing debentures.
(c)  In an attempt to supplement and diversify its long-term foreign
currency resources, SMIB plans to consult with the Government
before entering into discussions with foreign commercial lenders
with a view to raising foreign commercial borrowings.
