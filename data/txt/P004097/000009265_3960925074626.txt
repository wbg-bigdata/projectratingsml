PROJECT COMPLETION REPMRT
FOURTH SMALL AiD MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK PROJECT
(LOAN 2004-O)
PREFACE
This is the Project Completion Report (PCR) for the Fourth SMIB
project in Korea, for which Loan 2004-KO in the amount of US$60.0 million
was approved on May 26, 1981. The loan was closed on December 31, 1985.
It was fully disbursed and the last disbursement was made on March 12,
1986.
The PCR was prepared by the Industry and Energy Operations Division,
Country Department II, Asia Region (Preface, Evaluation Summary, Parts I
and III). Although the Borrower was helpful in providing useful data,
particularly for Part III of the report, the Borrower expressed great
difficulty in completing the PCR. During a supervision mission on a
follow-up project in March, 1989, the mission discussed Parts I and III of
the report with the Borrower. The mission requested the Borrower to make
comments on the report but no comments were received.
This PCR is based, inter alia, on the Staff Appraisal Report; the
Loan, Guarantee and Project Agreements; supervision reports: correspondence
between the Bank and the Borrower; internal Bank memoranda; SMIB annual
reports and selected project data provided by the Borrower.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT

FOURTH SM&LL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK PROJECT
(LOAN 2004-KO)
EVALUATION SUMARY
1.       The Bank loan of US$60 million, aimed at supporting development of
Korea's small and medium industry (SMI) sector, was approved on May 26,
1981. It followed three previous loans (Nos. 1175, 1507 and 1749-KO) to
the Small and Medium Industry Bank (SMIB), one of the main financial
institutions for the sector (para 2.02).
2.       The objectives of the fourth SMIB project were to: (a) augment
SMIB's capability to provide long-term investment capital for improving SMI
production facilities and technologies; (b) upgrade skills through the
preparation of a comprehensive action program aimed at reorganizing and
improving the efficiency of industrial extension services in Korea; and (c)
further improve SMIB's institutional capabilities by strengthening its
efficiency in resource mobilization and allocation (para 3.01).
3.        The project provided a line of credit to SMIB totaling US$60
million.  The Government of Korea agreed to finance and carry out a study
aimed at the reorganization of SMI extension services.  Similarly, SMIB
agreed to implement a staff training program in appraisal procedures and a
study of how it might enter the domestic bond market, as well as to adopt a
development stiategy statement committing it to mobilize funds from the
international capital market (para 3.02).
4.       The project's objectives were largely realized, despite initial
delays caused by the political and macroeconomic problems in the early
1980s which dampened demand for credit. Project completion was therefore
postponed by a year, but the loan was closed as scheduled on December 31,
1985. The Bank loan financed 259 subprojects with an average size of USS
230,000 and created some 4,100 permanent Jobs at an average fixed
investment cost per job of about US$ 29,000. This compares with the
appraisal estimate of 250 subprojects to be financed, creating 5,000 new
jobs at an average cost per job of about US$20,000. The Government also
completed a comprehensive study of the industrial extension services
provided to SMIs in Korea, which was developed into a set of action
programs in December 1981. The study's findings and action programs were
subsequently implemented under the Bank-assisted Small and Medium Machinery
Industry Project (Loan 2215-KO) (para 6.01-6 03).
5.       SMIB's institutional strengthening continued under the project,
for the most part successfully. Resource mobilization by SMIB, which had
declined somewhat in the late 1970s and represented a constraint on
increased long-term lending, improved under the project. In 1982 and 1983,



- iv -
SMIB for the first time successfully floated bonds totaling Von 120 billion
(about US$ 160 million equivalent), thus diversifying and increasing its
local currency resources and establishing its presence in the domestic
capital market. SHIB did not, however, feel the need for increased foreign
currency resource mobilization and did not therefore enter the
international capital market (para 6.04).
6.       Under the previous Bank loans, SMIB's appraisal standards for
foreign currency equipment loans improved significantly. In addition to
commercial credit analysis of subborrowers, appraisals included financial
&nd ecoraofile analyses uf the specific suDprojects.  Under this project,
SMIB and the Bank agreed to improve the appraisal practices of local
currency equipment loans, which continue to rely almost exclusively on
commercial credit analysis. However, this did not materialize since SMIB
found comprehensive appraisals too costly and time consuming. Similarly,
expectation that SMIB would undertake more sector and subsector studies,
which would serve as substitutes, if necessary, for detailed economic
appraisal of local currency loans, also did not materialize (para 6.07).
7.        With hz..Asight, the Bank's goal in this respect appears to have
been impractical. Typically, SMIB's subprojects financed by hard currency
are too small and numerous to justify a comprehensive and formal appraisal.
A majority of SMIB clients are repeat customers, and therefore SMI8 has
intimate knowledge of their business conditions. SMIB clients are
relatively unsophisticated and, cannot in many cases, provide detailed and
accurate information necessary for more rigorous and comprehensive
analysis. The experience under this project suggests that the Bank needs
to evaluate carefully the magnitude of likely gains and practical
constraints when requesting comprehensive project appraisals to DFCs,
particularly those which primarily cater to SMIs (para 6.08).
8.       In general, SMIB's financial position remained strong, although it
incurred operational losses in 1982 and 1983. This was due to the
adjustment in the Government's interest rate policy introduced in June
1982, which lowered the rate ceilings for lendings and deposits to 102 p.a.
and 8? p.a., respectively. While the lending rate reduction was effective
immediately, the rates for existing deposits were unchanged until
maturities, with many as high as 18? p.a. As the existing savings deposit's
matured, its profitability improved and SMIB become profitable in 1985 and
thereafter. The quality of S4IB's loan portfolio remained sound,
particularly considering the high risk associated with its clientele (para
6.05-6.06).
9.       The sustainability of economic benefits of the project is assured
as SMIB met the objectives of transferring resources to the SMIs and
creating new jobs in the economy. The project also brought about improved
competitiveness and betterment of skills to the SMIs as well as improved
institutional capability to SMIB (para 7.01).
10.      On the whole, this project was  well prepared and implemented.
Together with previous three loans to SMIB, this project made a significant
contribution to the development SMIB and the SMI sector (para 9.04).

FOURTH SMALL AND MEDIUM INDUSTRY BANK PROJECT

PART I: PROJECT REVIEW FROM THE BANK'S PERSPECTIVE

RVP Unit            Asia Region
Country             Korea
Sector           : Industry
Subsector        : Small and Medium Industry
2.    Background
2.01.    During the seventies, Korea's comparative advantage in the
production of labor-intensive light manufactured goods, on which the small
and medium industry (SMI) sector was heavily dependent, had eroded rapidly
due to rising labor costs in Korea and the emergence of efficient
competitors in world markets. The Government's industrial strategy
initially reacted to this by promoting skill and technology development in
large industry, with a reallocation of financial and human resources away
from the SMI sector that made it difficult for the sector to increase
productivity and improve the quality of its output through capital
investment. In time, however, a more balanced industrial development
strategy was pursued, in recognition of the contributions of SMI to
employment creation, regional dispersal of industry and growth of
manufactured exports as well as the fact that investment in heavy industry
had in some instances exceeded the levels dictated by market size,
financing capacity and technical capability. Efforts to improve SMI
competitiveness were supported by the Bank, among other things, through a
series of loans to individual DFCs, including four loans (Nos. 1175, 1507,
1749 and 2004-KO) which channeled funds to the sector through the Small and
Medium Industry Bank (SMIB), with measures introduced to gradually
strengthen SMIB capabilities.
2.02     The fourth loan, approved on May 26, 1981, particularly focused on
raising SMI productivity through investment in modernized facilities and
improved technology and, more importantly, investment in upgrading human
skills. In support of the latter goal, the project laid the basis for a
much-needed reorganization of SMI extension services which, at the time,
were provided by numerous institutions whose effectiveness was limited by,
among other things, inadequate numbers of qualified extension staff. Their
services would have to be made more responsive to the needs of SMIs. In
addition, clearly articulated operational policies and institutional
objectives were needed to provide the extension services with appropriate
direction and priorities. Although the Small and Medium Industry Promotion
Corporation (SMIPC) had been established in 1979 as a leading institution
for extension services to concentrate assistance on priority subsectors,



train extension agents and coordinate technical assistance services, it
lacked the expertise and staff capability to fulfill its mandate.
3.    Prolect Objectives and Description
3.01     The fourth Bank loan to SMIB was therefore formulated not only to
support the financing needs of the SMI sector, but also to encourage
improved industrial extension services to the sector. Its principal
objectives were to: (a) augment SHIB's capability to provide long-term
investment capital for improving SMI production facilities and
technologies; (b) upgrade human skills through the preparation of a
comprehensive action program aimed at reorganizing and improving the
efficiency of industrial extension services in Korea; and (c) further
improve SMIB's institutional capabilities by strengthening its efficiency
In resource mobilization and allocation.
3.02     The project provided a line of credit to SMIB totaling US$60
million which was expected to cover about 402 of its projected foreign
currency commitment needs during mid-1981 to mid-1983. The Government of
Korea also agreed to undertake a comprehensive SMI Extension Services Study
at its own expense, with the objective of producing a program to reorganize
extension services to SMI based on a clear formulation of objectives and a
detailed review of the existing organizations. SMIB agreed to implement a
s-aff training program in appraisal procedures and, for the purpose of
expanding resource mobilization, to carry out a study of how it might enter
the bond market and to include in its Development Strategy Statement a
commitment to mobilize funds from the international capital market.
4.    Project Institution
4.01     SMIB was established in 1961 to extend financial and limited
technical assistance to SMI. It carries out a wide range of -ommercial
banking functions, including the mobilization of deposits, issuance of
letters of credit and short-term lending for working capital. As a
development bank, it provides long-term investment financing to SMIs.
Prior to this project, SMIB received three Bank loans which assisted in its
institutional development, particularly in the areas of (a) resource
mobilization through its rapidly expanding branch network; (b) development'
of appraisal and supervision capabilities for term loans; and (c) promotion
of labor-intensive industries. SMIB's performance under these operations
was satisfactory.
5.    Project Design
5.01     The project design was appropriate.  Against the background o'
rising Korean labor costs and the call for increased productivity and
enhanced skills and technology, this operation specifically emphasized
developing SMIB's capacity to support investment projects which would lead
to higher labor productivity, and enhanced production efficiency and
product quality. In the previous Bank-assisted SKIB operations, the
eligibility of sub-borrowers for project loans had been defined in terms of
maximum asset size of applicants. Under this loan, however, the main sub-
borrower eligibility criterion was based on maximum size of employment, in



-3-
order to reflect the productivity emphasis as opposed to the employment
emphasis in the past, and to allow more flexibility in financing relatively
capital-intensive projects. For the same reason, the subloan ceiling was
also increased to US$2 million. The various actions agreed upor in
conjunction with the project also addressed needed institutional
development and reforms (para 4).
6.    Project Performance
6.01     The Credit Component.  Demand for credit during the first year of
the project (Bank FY82) was poor, primarily due to the slowdown in the
country's economic growth following the negative growth rate of 4.8Z in
1980, unprecedented in Korea's recent history. As a result, only US$2.4
million of the loan was actually disbursed that year as opposed to t..e
appraisal estimate of US$10.5 million (Table 3 of Part III). The
disbursement projections prepared at appraisal underestimated the gravity
of the slowdown. SMIB operations recovered by mid-1983, and consequently
loan disbursements picked up. By 1985, the loan was fully disbursed and,
despite a one-year delay in subproject commitments, the loan closed as
scheduled on December 31, 1985 (Table 4 of Part III).
6.02     The original objectives of the credit component were achieved.
The loan financed 259 subprojects, which created about 4,100 jobs at an
average fixed investment cost per job of US$29,000. This compares with the
appraisal estimate of 250 subprojects and 5,000 new jobs to be created at
an average cost per job of US$20,000. The average cost of job was
increased by two thirds from the Third SMIB Loan, indicating the capital
intensity and the emphasis on productivity improvement of the subloans
under this project. On the basis of a sample survey of 20 subprojects, for
which FRRs and ERRs were calculated by SMIB, ex post financial rates of
return (FRRs) ranged from 14? to 37Z while ex post economic rates of return
(ERRs) ranged from 182 to 57?. Sectoral and regional distributions of
subprojects were satisfactory.
6.03     Extension Services.  The Government completed a comprehensive
study of the industrial extension services provided to SMIs in Korea, on
which it developed a set of action programs in December 1981. The study's
findings and action programs in turn formed the basis for the
rationalization of SMI extensicn service institutions, which was a matter
of primary importance and urgency for the development of the SMI sector.
The rationalization program was successfully implemented under the Small
and Medium Machinery Industry Project (Loan 2215-KO), with SMIPC as the
leading organization which provides customer-oriented extension services.
6.04     Institutional Development.  In compliance with a Loan Agreement
covenant that SMIB would take all necessary measures to diversify and
increase its local currency resources, SMIB raised a total of Won 120
billion, or about US$ 160 million equivalent, in 1982 and 1983 through the
issuance of both long- and short-term debentures. By taking such action,
SMIB took the first steps to establish its presence in the market.
However, with a Government-imposed lending rate ceiling of 10?, SMIB's
interest rates on its long-term debentures, averaging 19Z, resulted in
large negative spreads. As a result SMIB did not remain in the debenture



- 4 -
market. (In December 1988, the Government liberalized the interest rates.)
The understanding reached tinder the project that SMIB would diversify and
increase its foreign currency resources became irrelevant in view of lower
than expected demand. Nevertheless, SMIB maintained regular contact with
potential overseas lenders in order to complement its resources if the need
arose.
6.05     SMIB's financial position remained generally strong throughout the
term of the project, although in 1982 and 1983 it incurred operational
losses totalling Won 24 billion. This was due to adjustments in the
Government's interest rate policy introduced in June 1982, which lowered
the rates ceilings for lendings and deposits to 102 p.a. and 82 p.a.,
respectively. While the lending rates reduction was effective immediately,
the rates for existing deposits were unchanged until maturities, with many
as high as 182 p.a. Despite these losses, SMIB maintained a satisfactory
long-term debt to equity ratio which remained below the covenanted ratio of
10:1. As the existing savings deposits matured, SMIB's profitability
improved, and SMIB became profitable in 1985 and thereafter.
6.06     Considering the high-risk nature of SMI customers, the quality of
the SMIB loan portfolio was excellent, recording overall collection rates
of 90-952 throughout the project period. SMIB's excellent arrears position
and collection performance resulted from its well developed supervision and
collection procedures. They are also attributable to the peculiarities of
the Korean financial system in which a numbpr of well-run institutions
assist banks in minimizing loan losses. This system comprises of the
Credit Guarantee Fund, the Loan Readjustment Corporation which processes
loan foreclosures on behalf of financial institutions, and a credit
information system operated by the Bank of Korea. Moreover, the main
factor behind the soundness of Korean financial institutions has been the
good performance of Korean industry.
6.07     One of the major Institutional development goals of improving
SMIB's appraisal practices was not achieved. Traditionally, Korean DFCs
relied heavily on commercial credit analysis of sub-borrowers in loan
decision making, encouraging speedy financing decisions in favor of
established and solvent firms. Typically, no comprehensive appraisals of
project viabilities were conducted. Against this background, the Bank
emphasized the importance of comprehensive financial and economic
appraisals of the projects to be financed in addition to the commercial
credit analysis. Under the previous Bank loans, SMIB's appraisal standards
for foreign currency equipment loans improved significantly and were
considered satisfactory. Under this project, SMIB attempted to improve the
appraisal practices of local currency equipment loans, which continued to
rely almost exclusively on commercial credit analysis. However, this did
not materialize since SMIB found comprehensive appraisals too costly and
time consuming. In addition, given the high quality of its loan portfolio,
SMIB saw no compelling reason to change appraisal practices, which are
still unchanged to date. Similarly, expectations that SMIB would undertake
more sector and subsector studies, which would supplement project
appraisals, also did not materialize.



6.08     With hindsight, the Bank's goal in this respect appear
impractical. Typically, SMIB subprojects are too small and numerous to
justify comprehensive and formal appraisals which includes financial and
economic analyses. A majority of SMIB clients are repeat customers, and
therefore. SMIB has intimate knowledge on their business conditions. SMIB
clients are relatively unsophisticated and unable, in many cases, to
provide detailed and accurate information necessary for more rigorous and
comprehensive analysis. The experience under this project suggest that the
Bank need to assess carefully likely gains and practical constraints when
requesting comprehensive subproject appraisals to DFCs, particularly those
which primarily cater to SMIs.
A.09     The same factors seem to have been partly responsible for SMIB's
lack of interest in expanding its research activities.   Although SMIB's
Development Strategy Statements for the project period, which were
formulated in consultation with the Bank, committed SMIB to integrating its
research activities closely with operations, preparation of market and
sector studie3 remained limited and undertaken only on an ad hoc basis. In
view of SMIB's short-cut appraisal procedures for domestic currency loans,
the Bank considered the lack of such studies as detrimental to SMIB's
operations. With the growth of industrial research and extension
institutions in Korea, however, SMIB's Research Department was gradually
curtailed. This decision reflected SMIB's efforts to reduce administrative
expenses in response to the difficult financial situation in 1982-84 and to
continue rapid expansion of its branch network and the resulting needs for
experienced staff.
6.'0      SMIB's supervision performance remained highly satisfactory.
Sut?rvision of project subloans was largely delegated to the branch
offices, except for foreign currency loans which were supervised jointly by
the head office and branches. SMIB developed an excellent loan reporting
system, in consultation with the Bank, which allows a comparison of actual
project performance with performance projections prepared during loan
appraisal. SMIB's supervision methods were very effective, which no doubt
contributed to the high quality of its loan portfolio and low level of
arrears.
7.    Project Sustainability
7.01     The sustainability of economic benefits of the project is assured
as SMIB met the objectives of resource transfer to the SMIs by disbursing
loan proceeds to some 259 subprojects. It was also successful injob
creation by providing some 5,000 new jobs to the economy. The project
brought about improved competitiveness and betterment of skills to the SMIs
through increased capital investments and improved institutional capability
to SMIB by strengthening its efficiency in resource mobilization and
allocation.
8.    Bank and Borrower Performance
8.01     The performance of the Bank was satisfactory, and the frequency
and composition of Bank supervision missions were adequate (Table 8 of Part
III). The performance of SMIB was also satisfactory throughout the project



period. SMIB implemented most of the action programs for institutional
development agreed under the project, and met all important covenants.
9.    Conclusions
9.01     During the 1980s, the Korean SMI sector has accomplished a major
transformation. In the 19708, the SMI sector was largely regarded as a
source of employment at relatively low cost, and an important, but a
declining source of manufactured exports. Its relative importance in the
Korean economy was decreasing. Despite the Government's support to
revitalize the sector, SMIs were experiencing difficulties to upgrade
technological capabilities and skill levels. Industrial extension service
organizations were fragmented, over which public resources were thinly
spread with only limited results.
9.02     Today, the SMI sector is one of the most dynamic and promising
sectors in the economy. SMIs play a vital role in the product and process
innovations, job creation and industrial specialization and
diversification. SMIs are a major source of direct and indirect exports.
The industrial extension services are much better organized and more
customer- oriented and effective compa.:ed with a decade ago. The policy
environment for promoting SMI development was much improved, having
culminated in the two important laws enacted in 1987, the Small and Medium
Industry Inauguration Assistance Act and the Venture Business Financial
Support Act. Together, they promote new sources and innovative use of
financing for technology intensive SMIs.
9.03     Since the first Bank loan approved in 1975, SMIB (then called
Medium Industry Bank) has grown rapidly. Today, SMIB (or Industrial Bank
of Korea, since it was renamed in 1987) has a total assets of about US$ 7
billion, an extensive branch network of about 194 domestic branches and
three overseas offices, and over 8,400 staff members. It is an efficiently
managed organization with a strong financial positions. As the Korean
financial sector is being liberalized, it is in a good position to increase
its importance in the sector. Due to the rapid improvement in the
country's balance of payment position and increasing trade surplus in
recent years, its loan portfolio to Korean SMIs involvirg foreign
currencies is significantly smaller in recent years, which necessitated the
merger of the Foreign Loan Department , originally created to handle the
Bank and ADB loans, into the International Department. In the future,
however, its international operations would likely expand as the country
becomes a net capital exporter and foreign investments by Korean SMIs
increase.
9.04     Loan 2004-KO was one of the last of a series of Bank operations
primarily geared to an individual DFC. The subsequent DFC operations had a
sector-wide focus, where key developmental constraints for the sector was
addressed, and more than one DFCs were involved in an operation. On the
whole, the Fourth SMIB loan was a well prepared and implemented operation.
Together with previous three loans to SMIB, this project made significant
contributions to the development of SMIB and the Korean SMI sector.



-7-
9.05     The main lesson of the project stems from the difficulty the Bank
experienced in convincing SMIB to introduce more comprehensive and
development bank oriented subproject appraisal procedures, to both foreign
and local currency equipment loans, in order to supplement the traditional
subborrower credit risk analysis. Given the large number and small size of
SHIB subloans, the original expectations of the Bank appear impractical.
The Bank may need to reassess this position in future operations,
particularly when dealing with DFCs which primarily cater to SMIs.
