0. Preface: Coordinated Programmatic Support for the Nile

0.1. Introduction

The project evaluated in this Implementation Completion and Results report (ICR) is one of
twenty-nine projects funded by the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF), which are all part of a much
larger programmatic approach to support Nile cooperation. Because of the complementary and
strategic nature of the projects, it would be incomplete to either evaluate the individual projects
in isolation of the overall programmatic framework or fail to look at the role each NBTF project
played in building Nile cooperation. This preface provides an overview of the coordinated
partner support to the Nile countries through and in coordination with the NBTF, to provide
background and context for the individual project ICR that follows.
The NBTF was created to support a trend of increasing cooperation in the Nile region. In 1995,
the Nile governments established the Nile Council of Ministers of Water Resources (Nile-COM)
and designed the Nile River Basin Action Plan, identifying 22 technical assistance projects
which aimed to address economic development and equitable use of the Nile waters. In 1999,
the Nile-COM adopted a long-term Shared Vision: to achieve sustainable socio-economic
development through equitable utilization of and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water
resources. More specifically, Nile Ministers adopted policy guidelines, “to develop the water
resources of the Nile Basin in a sustainable and equitable way to ensure prosperity, security and
peace for all its people; to ensure efficient water management and the optimal use of the
resources; to ensure cooperation and joint action between the Nile Basin countries; to target
poverty eradication and promote economic integration; and to ensure that the program results in
a move from planning to action.?
                                    In order to advance these policy guidelines, the Nile-COM
       Shared Vision                endorsed cooperation built around a Strategic Action Program
                                    with two complementary concepts: the need to enable a
         Shared
                                    common basis to achieve the Shared Vision for the Nile Basin
         Vision
                                    and the need to advance projects that benefited “the people and
       Program
                                    particularly the poor and disadvantaged in the Nile Basin.? As
                    Subsidiary      a result, Nile-COM endorsed two programs: the Shared Vision
                      Action        Program (SVP) and the Subsidiary Action Program (see Figure
                     Program        1). First, the Shared Vision Program was designed to build
    Action on the Ground            trust, confidence, and an enabling environment for the
                                    sustainable and equitable use of the Nile resources among
Figure 1: Complementary Design of   water professionals and the public. Second, as articulated by
Early Nile Programs                 Nile-COM, “a shared vision can only be legitimized by action
                                    on the ground,? the Subsidiary Action Program (SAP), one for
the Eastern Nile and one for the Equatorial Lakes, which focused on investment projects that
addressed agricultural needs, environmental risks, energy, and river management. To implement
these programs, the following year the Nile-COM ministers agreed to establish the Nile Basin
Initiative (NBI) as a transitional institutional arrangement. At establishment, NBI’s member
states were Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda,
Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda with Eritrea holding observer status. Membership is now ten
countries with South Sudan joining in July 2012.
                                                 1
In 2001, the Nile Basin governments and international development partners convened for the
International Consortium for Cooperation on the Nile (ICCON) in Geneva to discuss the Nile
Shared Vision and the proposed programs, pledging US$140 million for their implementation.
Based on the interest expressed by the Nile-COM and partners at ICCON, a multi-donor funding
mechanism, the Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF), was established at the World Bank in 2003 with
a consortium of ten international donors1 to support the countries in their pursuit of the Shared
Vision. Several donors also supported the NBI directly in coordination with the NBTF. With
this considerable partnership, overall financial support to NBI has far exceeded the ICCON
pledges.

Over the ten years, the NBTF supported twenty-
eight completed NBI projects as part of the
Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs,
and an Institutional Strengthening Project. The
last set of projects closed at the end of 2012
(Table 1). To enable full disbursement of NBTF
funds in support of NBI, partners to the NBTF
agreed a two year extension of the fund until
June 2015. An additional project, the Nile                                                                  Eastern Nile

The NBTF supported the Nile countries to
establish the NBI as a transitional institutional mechanism. The NBI is the only regional
water organization for all Nile Basin countries, aiming to operate as a catalyst for integrated
growth, investment and risk management to achieve the Shared Vision. To carry out the Shared
Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs, the three NBI Centers were formed; the NBI Secretariat
in Entebbe, Uganda and two Subsidiary Action Program offices, the Eastern Nile Technical
Regional Office in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary Action
Program – Coordination Unit in Kigali, Rwanda (Figure 2).

The governance structure is aligned with the basin-wide/sub-basin structure of the Nile Basin
Initiative, (Figure 3). A Nile Council of Ministers and a Technical Advisory Committee (Nile-
TAC) guides the basin-wide work of the NBI Secretariat (Nile-SEC). At the level of the Eastern
Nile sub-basin, an Eastern Nile Council of Ministers (EN-COM) and an Eastern Nile Strategic

the development partnership and support efforts to increase Nile cooperation outside but in coordination with the
NBTF partnership.

Equatorial Lakes sub-basin, the Nile Equatorial Lakes Council of Ministers (NEL-COM) and the
Nile Equatorial Lakes Technical Advisory Committee (NEL-TAC) provide governance services.

Through the ten projects under the Shared Vision Program (SVP), the NBI has improved
collaboration within the Basin. The US$87 million Shared Vision Program was designed to
build trust, strengthen capacity, and advance the enabling environment for investment in the Nile
Basin. The program created networks and partnerships that brought people together across the
Basin countries in various water-related sectors. According to a 2008 opinion poll, 2the program
created measurably greater levels of trust among such stakeholder categories as lawyers, media
professionals and women leaders. Through work on joint projects on a range of critical issues,
the SVP advanced a shared understanding of the need for regional engagement between the
countries, including in water resource management, environment, wetlands, and regional power
trade. The projects yielded a more organized knowledge base, a Decision Support System (DSS)
and other tools to better understand, model and analyze the basin, an inventory of wetlands, plans
for watershed management and regional power generation and transmission, studies of
agricultural productivity and opportunities for water savings, and trained over 2,000
professionals.

The Shared Vision Program provided platforms to bring country officials together at the policy
and the technical level. Based on these platforms, technical cooperation was strengthened
thereby helping basin-wide processes and practices to be shared and consolidated. By
establishing and managing a shared institution, and by collaborating on development projects
and risk-management strategies, the Nile Basin countries established common principles, without
which long-term cooperation would be difficult. Various project teams are in continuing contact
across countries, through other NBI projects, or other initiatives. The NBI is also establishing an
integrated policy environment, including a suite of policies called the Nile Basin Sustainability
Framework.

The NBI centers have improved the collation, analysis, and access to information relating to the
Nile basin, including a procedures and norms for date and information sharing and exchange.
The NBI has helped foster greater exchange not only on the river itself but on energy, agriculture
and trade opportunities. NBI is a platform that can be used as a mechanism to notify each other
of certain planned development projects using Nile waters.
Given its programmatic nature, the Shared Vision Program was reviewed by the World Bank in a
Programmatic Implementation Completion and Results Report in June 20103. The report
reviewed the achievements of the seven thematic projects as well as the umbrella coordination
project (Table 1). The Programmatic ICR found that the Outcomes, Bank performance and
Grantee Performance were all moderately satisfactory, with the risk to development outcomes
being rated as substantial.

While the outputs of many of the SVP projects were mainstreamed into other on-going initiatives,
two SVP projects implemented second phases; the Regional Power Trade Project which
produced a Comprehensive Basin-wide Study of Power Development Options and Trade
Opportunities: Proposed Development Options, Strategies and Investment Arrangements; and
the Water Resources Planning and Management Project extended the closing date until
December 31, 2012 to complete the Nile Basin Decision Support System - this second phase of
support has been reviewed in a new ICR.4
The Subsidiary Action Program helped identify and prepare investments of transboundary
significance to improve the livelihoods of the basin’s neediest populations and promote
sustainable growth through improved watershed management, flood preparedness, agricultural
improvement, power generation, and transmission. It also helped facilitate agreement among
countries to move some investments forward – such as the regional Rusumo Falls Hydroelectric
Project that is expected to make a significant contribution to access to power in Burundi, Rwanda,
and Tanzania. The NBI facilitated US$919 million of investment projects currently under
implementation, with a further US$1.584 billion under preparation (Table 2).

In addition, Subsidiary Action Program has helped the countries to consolidate their knowledge
of the sub-basins and develop new tools and applications to help better identify and plan
investments of regional significance. ENTRO and NELSAP-CU have provided studies and
analysis to their member governments to improve planning and implementation of regional
sustainable development projects. The NBI issues regional flood bulletins with hydrological
forecasts for the Eastern Nile to assist national, regional and community authorities in predicting
floods. University networks, especially in the Eastern Nile, have been strengthened through
collaborative studies, internship programs, and workshops.

                                                              as well as to consolidate the gains of
                                                              the SVP and SAPs. The project
started in 2008 and closed in December 2012. Through ISP, the NBI clarified its core functions
developed a five year Strategic Plan and a Financing Strategy to advance its sustainability. As a
result of this work, the Nile governments committed to incrementally increase their direct
financial contributions to the NBI to cover the core costs of the institution by 2017 (FY2018).

The NBI has also developed a suite of Strategic Plans for each Center and a consolidated concept
note of projects for 2013 – 2017 which was presented to development partners in November
2011. The overarching Strategic Plan, (Figure 4) shows how the NBI’s current work expands its
original programmatic structure including the Shared Vision and Subsidiary Action Programs.
As part of implementing the new Strategic Plan and building on other projects, the NBI prepared
the Nile Cooperation for Results (NCORE) Project. This project is supporting NBI activities in
its three core functions of facilitating cooperation, water resource management, and water
resource development.
The support provided through the ISP enabled results to be achieved across the NBI, including
the twenty-one other SVP and SAP projects that were undertaken by the NBI during ISP
implementation, as well as the subsequent work that was enabled by the ISP project. While a
stand-alone ICR for the ISP project has been produced7, the breadth of the ISP results can only
truly be assessed when looking at the successes and lessons of the other NBI efforts as well.

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal
Collaboration within the Nile Basin, though often discussed as a political, economic or technological
challenge, begins with a knowledge-related challenge. If a shared understanding of the river is not
developed, neither politics, nor economics, nor technology will help the countries work together to reach
the Nile Basin Initiative’s overarching goal, “to achieve sustainable socio-economic development through
equitable utilization of and benefit from the common Nile Basin water resources.?

In 1999 when the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) was formed, although the Nile Basin countries had tools for
understanding the river none were shared by all countries. There was limited data sharing and fragmented
data, and wide variations in capacity to model and analyze water resources across the basin countries.
Knowledge and understanding of river system behavior and inter-linkages, particularly transboundary
impacts, was limited, often resulting in misperceptions about possible opportunities and trade-offs.
Knowledge of potential climate change impacts was also limited. The complexity and variability of the
river basin’s hydrology required an integrated approach to water resources management, enabled by the
creation of a shared knowledge base and a common set of analytical tools as well as technical capacity.

The Bank was requested to support the Nile Basin Initiative by the Nile Council of Ministers from the
nine member countries including the identification and development of a portfolio of projects, and the
formation and management of a multi-donor financing mechanism, Nile Basin Trust Fund (NBTF). The
Bank subsequently raised US$200m from donors and through the NBTF funded the Shared Vision
Program (SVP) of seven projects to build trust and confidence across the basin, the Subsidiary Action
Programs (SAP) to identify and prepare investments, and an institutional strengthening project.

This project, the Water Resources Planning & Management project (WRPMP), is one of the Shared
Vision Program projects. It aimed to build analytical capacity for the NBI8 to support informed and
transparent decision-making in multi-stakeholder and multi-country contexts. This helps to facilitate
confidence and trust among stakeholders and countries - a key dimension of Nile cooperation - and the
achievement of the Shared Vision of sustainable socio-economic development through the equitable
utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources. The primary output of the
project, the Nile Basin Decision Support System (DSS), is a software framework with a suite of modeling
and information management tools for communication, information management and analysis of water
resources. It provides a platform for sharing knowledge, understanding river system behavior, and
evaluating alternative development and management scenarios (Boxes 1 and 2).

The project was designed as a six year project with a budget of US$32.86m of which the Nile Basin Trust
Fund grant was US$23.89m9. At the design stage, two phases were envisaged to align with funding
availability, with the second phase planned as a direct follow-on with additional financing. However
when Phase 2 was being prepared, the Bank Nile team was advised that a new project and grant

Technical Regional Office (ENTRO) based in Addis Ababa Ethiopia, and the Nile Equatorial Lakes Subsidiary
Action Program Coordination Unit (NELSAP-CU) based in Kigali Rwanda.

  Project Appraisal Document, Report No. 31989, April 2005. Phase 1 had four components: Water Policy
(supported by BMZ/GIZ, closed December 2008), Project Planning and Management (supported by AfDB, closed
December 2010), the Decision Support System (supported by NBTF, continued for phase 2, closed 31 December
2012), and a regional management component (supported by NBTF, continued for phase 2, closed 31 December
2012).

                                                     9
agreement was required and that the remaining funds from Phase 1 should be channeled to Phase 2 upon
its closure.

Phase 1 of the project (P075946/TF053906) was effective in February 2005 with a grant of US$ 12.8
million, closing in April 200910. As planned, Phase 2 (P116318/TF093972), which became effective on
30 March 2009 with a grant of US$ 11.2 million, continued the work of Phase 1 with the focus on the
ongoing development, application and sustainability of the DSS11. Upon closure of Phase 1, the remaining
funds were channeled into Phase 2, making the total Phase 2 grant US$17.2 million. Overall the NBTF
grant to the project for both phases was US$24.0 million.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives (PDO) and Key Indicators
The Project Development Objective was to enhance analytical capacity for a basin wide perspective to
support the development, management, and protection of Nile Basin water resources in an equitable,
optimal, integrated, and sustainable manner.

The PDO indicators, only one of which was applicable to Phase 212 were:
    National water policies and strategies improved or initiated based on sound integrated resources
      management (IWRM) and good-practice guidelines in Nile Basin countries. (A phase 1 indicator,
      not relevant for phase 2 as no related component).
    Nile riparians prepare and implement multi-country projects based on sound IWRM principles
      and good practice in project planning and management. (A phase 1 indicator, not relevant for
      phase 2 as no related component).
    Decision Support System (DSS) is operational and used by Nile riparians to exchange
      information, support riparian dialogue, and identify cooperative investment projects. (The focus
      of Phase 2).

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators, and
reasons/justification
The PDO remained unchanged for the duration of the project. The PDO indicators, outcomes and
outcome indicators were reviewed and revised in January 2011, almost half way through the
implementation period; the changes were approved by Nile Program Manager 13. The revisions were to
make the PDO indicators more relevant to the original (unchanged) PDO, deleting two indicators which
related to components that were never active in phase 2, and making the third more specific and
measurable. The revised results framework formed the basis of all subsequent monitoring by the
WRPMP and the Bank.




10
   WRPMP Phase 1 was assessed as part of the Programmatic Implementation Completion and Results report of the
Shared Vision Program in June 2010. It was rated as satisfactory and the risk to the development outcome was rated
as substantial. The Bank performance for quality at entry, supervision and overall performance was assessed as
satisfactory. Borrower performance was also satisfactory. The report noted the need for careful succession planning
for the DSS including the transformation of the PMUs regional DSS Centre into a sustainable institution.
11
   Project Paper Phase II, March 2009.
12
   Two of the PDO indicators were not relevant to Phase 2 because the overall project design did not link the
development of the DSS (component 3) to the first two PDO indicators (components 1 and 2).
13
   At the time the team was advised that these changes would not require a formal approval process. In preparing
the ICR, the team sought advice from IEG who confirmed that only PDO changes required approval, not upgraded
indicators as in this case.

                                                        10
The revised single PDO indicator was:
    Level of effectiveness of DSS operation in three NBI Centers and in nine member countries
        (rated as high, medium, low based on standard criteria assessed periodically by project team).
This indicator aimed to measure the extent of ‘enhanced analytical capacity’ by specifically assessing
whether the NBI and riparians could operate the DSS sustainably based on standard criteria and
requirements for NBI and for the countries. Indicators at outcome level measured the extent of application
by NBI and riparians to regional and national case studies. Relative to the original, the revised PDO
indicator for DSS is more precise and rigorous in the definition of “operational?, “used? and “Nile
riparians?. The revised PDO indicator does not specifically address the purpose of use (e.g., identify
cooperative investment projects) of the DSS, as generally indicated in the original indicator; however,
intermediate outcome indicators cover this aspect (see section 1.5 below).

1.4 Main Beneficiaries
The primary target group is the Nile Basin Initiative and its member countries. The Project Paper for
Phase 2 was not explicit on beneficiaries but noted that realization of project objectives would play a key
role in enabling the NBI and an emergent Nile river basin organization to accomplish its expected
mandate. The DSS would create a common knowledge base and technical tools to provide the means for
clarifying the impacts and implications of various development alternatives and thereby enable the NBI
countries to make joint investment decisions. The DSS was also recognized to be a critical tool to enable
the NBI to sustainably manage the Nile’s waters and respond to emerging challenges, for example to
identify the best regional solutions to climate change-related impacts on water resources in the basin.
Through such joint efforts, the DSS was expected to strengthen trust and regional cooperation among
riparians, spurring greater regional integration and the additional benefits that may ensue.

The original PAD for the project is more explicit on beneficiaries. It notes the sustainable development of
water resources and water-related investment projects on a regional scale is central to the goal of poverty
alleviation in the Nile Basin with the development of mutually acceptable and environmentally sound
investment projects to support sustainable economic growth and improved social conditions in the long
term benefiting the entire population of the Nile Basin.

The immediate beneficiaries of the project were noted to be policymakers and decision makers as well as
planners and managers of water resources in the Nile riparian countries. Enhanced skills coupled with
improved analytical tools and strengthened institutions were expected to improve the basis for strategic
planning, the identification and implementation of cooperative projects, and sound technical evaluations.

Component 1: Nile Basin Decision Support System (DSS). Building upon the achievements in Phase 1
particularly the completion of a needs assessment and the conceptual design of the DSS as well as the
establishment of the project team at regional and national levels, the activities in Phase 2 focused on the
actual development of the DSS and on its practical application. Specific aspects included:



14
  DSS funding for phase 1 was US$ 4.53m, so overall phase 1 and 2 is US$18.30m in total
15
  Regional cooperation and facilitation funding for phase 1 was US$2.14m, so overall phase 1 and 2 is US$5.49m in
total. Phase 2 includes a fee of US$1.5 million for the Management Services Agency (UNOPS) for 2010-2012.

                                                       11
    DSS development: The development of the DSS was based on the needs assessment and conceptual
     design completed as a consultative process with the member countries in Phase 1. Phase 2 included
     three parallel and interactive work packages: i) software development, ii) data preparation, model
     calibration, testing and certification, and iii) supervision and monitoring. In addition, the development
     of the DSS involved parallel testing of the product (with successive defined releases of the DSS each
     with additional functionality) on selected project cases. This aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of
     the DSS to decision makers and to build a forward work plan for its application, thereby helping to
     keep it ‘live’ throughout the long and highly technical development period.

    Institutional and human capacity strengthening: DSS development was accompanied by continuous
     involvement and training of staff from across the NBI and the national DSS units in all NBI countries.
     This built their skills for future application to regional and national issues to ensure the sustainable
     use of the DSS after project completion. The training program was linked to the successive DSS
     releases which enabled skills to be built progressively as DSS functionality increased.

    Data guidelines and information exchange: This included several activities to build knowledge and
     information sharing, in particular development of Nile Basin data and information sharing procedures
     and their subsequent application, and consolidation of the Nile Basin knowledge base that covered
     diverse aspects of water and related resources, the Nile Information-System.

Component 2: Regional Coordination and Facilitation. This was a continuation of activities started
under Phase 1 ensuring the proactive management of the project and maximized added value of
engagement across NBI and with other related regional initiatives. Activities included facilitation of the
Project Steering Committee, linkages to other NBI projects to build synergies16, and linkages to
appropriate regional initiatives to further regional knowledge coordination17. As for Phase 1, the
execution of the project was divided between NBI and a Management Services Agency18. The large
consultant contracts for DSS development were executed by the NBI and directly disbursed by the Bank.
Remaining project activities at both regional and national levels continued to be executed on behalf of the
NBI by a Management Services Agency.

The original intermediate results and indicators are given in Table 1. The original results framework is

  In particular the Institutional Strengthening Project (P110616) and the Eastern Nile Planning Model project
(P103639), both also funded by the NBTF.
17
  In particular the Sida funded, UNEP implemented project, adapting to climate change induced water stress in the
Nile River Basin.
18
  All the Shared Vision Program projects were supported by a Management Services Agency, UNOPS. This was
required to enable NBI to hire staff in all countries (since NBI did not have legal status in all countries) as well as to
support and oversee procurement and financial management as NBI gained capacity.

1.7 Other significant changes
There were no significant changes to the design, scope, scale, implementation arrangements or schedule.

The Nile Secretariat requested additional financing of US$1.85m in May 2012. This was to enhance the
functionality, sustainability and application of the DSS. Instead of an additional grant to the WRPMP, the
Bank and project team agreed to finance the required activities from other related NBTF funded projects.
This stimulated greater cross sharing of information and learning as well as strengthening synergies
between NBI projects. It also maximized cost effectiveness and disbursement across the NBI portfolio.
The WRPMP partnered with the Eastern Nile Planning Model (ENPM, P103639, TF94549) and with the
Regional Agricultural Trade Project (RATP, P115414, TF95157). Each project contributed approximately
US$500,000 for additional features, some training, equipment and additional software licenses.

South Sudan joined NBI as a formal member in July 2012. To support their integration, an NBI senior
management team including from the WRPMP traveled to Juba to discuss the NBI Shared Vision,
Strategic Plan, program framework and current projects, member state obligations (such as financial
contributions) and to assess their priorities requirements to benefit from NBI. This included an
assessment of technical capacity within the ministry to utilize the DSS and support to build capacity, with
immediate access to DSS regional training and provision of DSS related equipment and software.

Box 2 Description of the Nile Basin Decision Support System

The Nile Basin Decision Support System

The Nile Basin Decision Support System is a software framework with a suite of modeling and
information management tools for communication, information management and analysis of water
resources. It provides a platform for sharing knowledge, understanding river system behavior, and
evaluating alternative development and management scenarios. It supports informed and transparent
decision-making in multi-stakeholder and multi-country contexts. This helps to facilitate confidence
and trust among stakeholders and countries - a key dimension of Nile cooperation - and the
achievement of the Shared Vision of sustainable socio-economic development through the equitable
utilization of, and benefit from, the common Nile Basin water resources.

The Nile Basin DSS has been designed to meet the requirements of complex multi-sector water
resources planning. It provides diverse toolsets for data processing, modeling, scenario management,
optimization and multi-criterion decision making as well as tools for integrating environmental, social
and economic objectives into planning. It is a generic system that can be applied at basin, sub-basin,
and national scales, enabling a broad range of applications by the NBI and its member states. It is easily
adaptable and can be extended with new toolsets without the need for a major change to the program
code. This maximizes its versatility.

Functionality includes:

   Simulation of river basin hydrologic processes. The DSS has integrated modeling tools for
    simulating water balance, water allocation, river flow, erosion and sedimentation. It allows
    investigation of impacts of existing and planned infrastructure investments and water uses, such
    hydro-power and irrigated agriculture.
   Scenario analysis and management. The DSS can create, edit, simulate, and analyse water resources
    development and management scenarios, and then compare scenarios based on parameters selected
    by the user. The built-in cost-benefit-analysis functions allow quantification of benefits, impacts
    and trade-offs of scenarios.
   Multi-objective optimization. This tool generates optimal solutions to a range of water resources
    planning problems. Users can integrate economic, social and environmental parameters.
   Multi-criteria decision analysis. The DSS supports informed and transparent decision making
    through evaluation of the consequences of various decision options, integrating the objectives and
    preferences of the range of stakeholders.
   Integration of environmental and socio-economic objectives. The DSS has a built-in indictor tool
    for quantification and evaluation of environmental and socio-economic consequences of water
    resources development and management scenarios. These can be used to rank scenarios using the
    multi-criteria decision analysis tool.
   Comprehensive information management. The DSS has an integrated database coupled with a suite
    of statistical data management tools for analysis, visualization and archiving of diverse types of
    data. Its GIS functionality enables users to analyse and generate special and geo-referenced
    datasets.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry
Project preparation19 and design was thorough and involved extensive consultation with the NBI member
countries and international DSS experts facilitated by an international firm. This included a number of
study tours and training so that the project team and the Project Steering Committee could review global
good practice. Study visits included Colorado, Murray-Darling, and Mekong river basins. Quality at
entry was sound as Phase 2 was a direct follow-on from Phase 1 which had satisfactory ratings for
Achievement of PDO and Implementation Progress.

Lessons of earlier operations were taken into account. Lessons learned from earlier activities on the Nile
Basin other major international basins were incorporated in project design. Firstly, the emphasis on
building analytical capacity and a common modeling and analysis platform to inform basin planning,
management and development for all member countries. This was aimed to ‘level the playing field’ and
bring transparency to decision making. Secondly, the involvement of all member countries in the design
and implementation of the project to build ownership and acceptance. Thirdly, extensive capacity
building at national as well as regional and sub-regional levels to ensure the broad application of the DSS
to inform decision making. And finally, the capacity and continuity of the project team was considered
critical to ensuring the successful development of the DSS to meet Nile basin requirements.

Key risks and mitigation measures were identified. Risks included the ambitious work program requiring
diligence in monitoring progress; the need for an appropriate regional-national balance in order to ensure
country uptake; the potential for an overly process-oriented approach; and the need for appropriate focus
on the long-term sustainability of the DSS both within the NBI and at national level. All the identified
risks played out during the implementation of the project and were effectively mitigated by the project.
An overarching risk that the Nile countries would not remain actively engaged in the NBI process was
also identified and although mitigation measures were proposed to continue engagement, this was largely
beyond the influence of the project. Another overarching risk was that countries could not reach
agreement on data sharing with mitigation measures including a consultative process and sufficient time
for review and consultation.

Participatory processes were essential and substantial. The DSS had to be developed and used in such a
way that all riparians had full confidence in the ability of the system to provide rational and objective
support based on the best available data, information, and estimates. To achieve this, all riparians were
involved on an equal footing in the development process. A comprehensive needs assessment was
conducted at regional, sub-regional, and national levels to inform the potential scope of DSS application.
This was consolidated into a set of eight priorities and two cross cutting issues (Box 3). Participation
continued into technical development and testing. Assumptions, methodologies, and technical
descriptions were agreed and readily accessible by users and decision makers. Getting an appropriate
balance between participation and inclusiveness and the need for progress within tight schedules initially
proved challenging for the project team.




19
     The project was designed as one and only separated into phase 1 and 2 due to availability of NBTF financing.

2.2 Implementation
Implementation of the project was smooth, building on the existing structures, staffing and procedures
from Phase 1. There were no changes to implementation arrangements. The project was rated as
satisfactory throughout its duration. Risks were proactively monitored and mitigated.

Overall, implementation of the WRPMP should really be viewed in the context of the collective project
support to the NBI. This includes the Institutional Strengthening Project as well as the various knowledge
and water resources development projects with the SAPs which created a demand for the DSS application.
In isolation from the other projects, the implementation and success of WRPMP as well as the
sustainability of its outcomes would not have been possible.

Factors that contributed to success
 The drive for equitable and sustainable utilization with development of the basin. Development of
   the shared Nile water resources has historically been unilateral, with limited assessment of the
   resulting impacts and implications for upstream or downstream riparians. Several basin countries
   have repeatedly stated their desire for tangible on-the-ground investments and recognize that
   cooperative action can lead to broader benefits. With increasing demand for water from population
   growth and economic development, and with increasing awareness for the protection of
   environmental flows, the basin countries recognized that the options and implications of management
   and development needed to be better understood for them to be able to maximize their investment
   opportunities and collectively mitigate risks.

   The clear need for a common analysis platform and country demand. The project focused on a clear
    need of the basin countries to develop a common analysis platform to support a better understanding
    of and informed decision making about the opportunities, challenges, and potential scenarios and

                                                   17
     trade-offs of cooperative water resources management and development. It was recognized that a
     DSS would form the corner stone of any river basin organization, helping to bring knowledge and to
     ‘level the playing field’ particularly noting the complexities of Nile hydrology, the uncertainty of
     climate change, and the asymmetry of understanding and capacity between Nile riparians. The
     WRPM project in general, and the Nile DSS in particular, were prioritized by the Nile Council of
     Ministers in 1999 as part of the development of the Shared Vision Program. Now that the DSS has
     been developed, Member States are prioritizing cases for its further application including broadening
     the general knowledge base about Nile hydrology and for specific development scenarios and
     projects.

    The project had a very specific focus. The project was focused on the development of the DSS and
     related capacity for its sustained use, with a clear PDO and well defined outputs. All activities were
     specific to achieving the objective, within the available budget and timeframe for the project. The
     project team set out clear milestones for progress which were reviewed regularly including by the
     project steering committee, drawing attention as required to manage slippages (such as data sharing)
     to the NileTAC.

    Mainstreaming and sustainability issues were considered from the start. With a long term view,
     consideration of mainstreaming and sustainability was a pre-requisite for a successful project. This
     required attention to the institutional, financial, and technical issues which would enable the effective
     operation and maintenance of the DSS. At project-level, the PMU provided the dedicated capacity to
     develop the DSS, and at the basin-level, close working relations were built with the WRM
     Department at the Nile SEC20 to provide the long term institutional home for the DSS. At the
     national level, building DSS capability in national focal point institutions (typically the ministries of
     water) was a key element of the project, with project funded staff supporting national staff for DSS
     application on national issues. A DSS sustainability plan was developed in mid-2011 which provided
     actions for immediate attention (prior to project closure), the short term (2013-2017 corresponding o
     the NBI Strategic Plan), medium term (2017-2023) and longer term (post 2023). It was reviewed and
     agreed by all the countries in December 2011, with the subsequent implementation of the immediate
     actions and a start on the short term actions. The latter are continuing to be implemented under a new
     NBTF/CIWA funded project for NBI, Nile Cooperation for Results (NCORE, P130694).

    Sustaining a highly qualified professional project team. The project’s success can be attributed to the
     professionalism and dedication of the team, and in particular the Regional Project Manager and the
     Lead DSS Specialist. The WRPMP is noted to have been the most technically challenging and
     institutionally complex project within the Shared Vision Program portfolio. The PMU operated across
     the three NBI Centers and across the nine NBI member countries21, with over 50 professional staff
     employed throughout the basin as well as support staff. In addition, the project achieved success
     operating in a challenging hydro-political context with a historic lack of data and information sharing.



20
   The WRM Unit at the Nile Secretariat was established and strengthened under a parallel NBTF funded project,
the Institutional Strengthening Project (P110616/TF93015). To support NBI to achieve sound integration of a key
building block for the institutions core function, the Bank Nile Program Manager designated the same Task Team
Leader for both projects from mid-2010 to their closure.
21
  The project focused on the nine NBI member countries. Whilst South Sudan only formally joined NBI six months
prior to project closure, participants from the Ministry of Water attended a number of training sessions and benefited
from provision of DSS related equipment. Support for DSS application in South Sudan is continuing under the
NCORE project.

                                                         18
   Proactive support from the World Bank. The Bank Nile team played a critical enabling role in the
    initiation and preparation of the project, drawing on global knowledge and experience. The project
    was a first of its kind in the Bank and with hindsight, the Bank’s commitment can be viewed as a
    visionary judgment call (leap of faith) with such a substantial investment at an early stage in the
    evolution of a river basin organization. This judgment recognized the imperative for sound analytical
    capacity to underpin Nile cooperation. The project was agreed to be ambitious in terms of its
    technical complexity and timeframe, as well as the need to meet the Nile COM requirement for a
    project team staffed entirely from the basin countries. The Bank team supported the project with
    sound advice to maintain the momentum and to overcome initial hurdles.

   Cooperation at the regional level was critical. The cooperation at the regional DSS level was
    supported by forming a DSS core team and regional DSS working groups with participation of staff
    from all riparian countries. Awareness raising workshops across a range of sectors helped to ensure
    that interaction occurred with relevant sectors outside the water sector on a regional and national
    basis.

   Process and results orientation had to be appropriately balanced. The implementation plan aimed to
    balance the need for a gradual, participatory development of the DSS based on collaboration and
    intensive training, with the need to demonstrate the usefulness of the DSS at an early stage to
    maintain momentum and interest. Whilst this was challenging, it was successfully achieved.

Factors that caused implementation problems

   Freeze in cooperation of two Member States. The context for Nile cooperation with negotiations over
    the Nile Comprehensive Framework Agreement and the subsequent freeze in participation of two
    Member States impacted negatively on project implementation. From mid-2010, the two Member
    States no longer participated in regional WRPMP workshops and did not formally receive project
    staff to the country. However engagement was maintained at a national level through the project
    funded staff within the host institution including, for example, continued training the national
    counterpart staff on updates of the DSS and Sudan’s development of a national DSS integration plan.

   Unequal interest and capacity in the basin countries. Not all Member States prioritized the DSS in
    the same way, partly due to the current status of the water sector in the country and their perception of
    its relevance. This often resulted in insufficient allocation of time for the counterpart staff to build
    their skills and learn from the project staff. The project team provided a number of countries with
    additional training as well as additional equipment to support the functional use of the DSS. Overall
    despite the challenges, only two of the nine countries were assessed as possibly not able to sustain
    DSS application, DRC and Rwanda. At the Project Steering Committee meetings, participants shared
    experiences, offering ideas to each other about how to increase commitment for greater national
    integration. Burundi in particular made great efforts and was assessed as achieving medium
    sustainability.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design, Implementation and Utilization
M&E design. The M&E system for the WRPMP was based on the results framework in the Project
Paper. It was largely appropriate with indicators, baselines and annual targets at objective, outcome and
output levels. With the revision of the results framework in early 2011, the M&E system was also revised.
A comprehensive Performance Management Framework was developed including the baselines, end of
project targets, and interim six monthly targets.



                                                     19
M&E implementation. The PMU with a dedicated M&E Officer managed the M&E system for the
project. This included monitoring of project progress, with assessment of implementation progress and
budget expenditure, and reporting against the planned activities for the month, quarter and year. M&E
has been rated as satisfactory throughout the project duration.

M&E Utilisation. The M&E system was utilized by the WRPMP Regional Project Manager, the
NileSEC, and the Bank team to track project implementation and results. Monthly activity reports were
produced and reviewed in line with financial reporting. Six monthly reports and annual reports were also
produced, reporting against the work program and budget. These were reviewed by the Project Steering
Committee and formed the basis for review during the Bank’s Implementation Support Missions.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance
Safeguard compliance. The project was rated as Category C in the Phase 1 PAD and the Phase 2 Project
Paper, reflecting the focus on building capacity and technical tools. This was unchanged throughout the
project duration. The project outcomes will help to facilitate sustainable development and conservation
of land, water and environmental resources through skills enhancement, building of technical tools for
regional analysis, and by enabling assessment of the social and environmental implications of any
proposed water resources management or development plans.

Financial Management. Financial management for the project was satisfactory and the risk rating
assessed as low. The basis for this assessment is as follows:
     Compliance with legal covenants related to financial management.
     Staffing was adequate and staff was well trained in World Bank policies and procedures.
     Internal control processes were satisfactory.
     Budgeting and budget management was sound and well monitored, including review of variance
        between planned and actual expenditure.
     The project submitted timely and good quality Interim Financial Reports (IFRs) on a quarterly
        basis with separate IFRs for the funds executed by the Nile Secretariat and by UNOPS.
     All the external annual audits were unqualified.
     The project disbursed virtually 100% of the grant amount of US$ 17.2 million, utilizing all the
        funds within the project period.

Procurement. Procurement compliance was satisfactory. The PMU maintained appropriate capacity,
systems and procedures throughout the duration of the project, with strengthening as required in line with
advice from the Bank’s procurement specialists. Procurement staff was familiar with Bank procedures
and received training. Major procurement activities were undertaken by the project including consultants
and goods which were well managed. The procurement register showed the total contracts for
consultancy services amounted to $12.86 million and the total for goods $0.135 million. The Bank
completed regular Post Procurement Reviews including a final review which was satisfactory.

2.5 Post-completion Operation/Next Phase
An integral part of the project was the sustainable operation of the DSS beyond the closure of the project
with mainstreaming of the DSS within the institutional structures at basin, sub-basin and national levels.
This was satisfactorily achieved.

Sustainability within the NBI is largely assured, with clear relevance and value of project outcomes to
NBI and related expert capacity to ensure sustained use. With the DSS now barely out of its development
stage, over the next few years further attention and support will be required to ensure its full
mainstreaming and effective use. With the closure of the WRPM project, the WRPMP team ensured
excellent transition to the long term host institution, the Nile Secretariat, ensuring full operational

                                                    20
effectiveness prior to closure of project with the ability to take the DSS to next stage of application. The
Nile Secretariat’s Water Resources Management Department has been established and strengthened to
become the basin-wide center for water resources analysis, offering technical advice and support for DSS
users. The sub-basin NBI development offices, ENTRO and NELSAP-CU are using the DSS for
planning and have capable units in place.

Sustainability within the NBI Member States has progressed well, with seven of the nine able to fully
utilize the NB DSS with trained staff and demonstrated applications for national planning. This
assessment is based on a range of issues considered by the project team. Host institutions have developed
integration plans including budget allocations and staffing plans, and most have signed a Memorandum of
Understanding with the NBI for the DSS operational use in accordance with the software license
agreement. In addition, in Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia22, the DSS host ministries have chosen the Nile
Basin DSS as the tool to support national level analysis and planning (within the Nile basin and beyond),
further enhancing its sustainability.

Since January 2013, the application of the DSS has been funded through an NBTF/CIWA project, Nile
Cooperation for Results (NCORE, P130694). NBI member states have been engaged in scoping and
deciding on applications for the DSS to address priority basin wide issues and challenges as part of the
development of the work plan for the WRM Department. Compelling information and analysis to inform
understanding of the basin, its management and development will be generated, including on economic,
social and environmental implications. In addition, some limited support at national level as well as a
user helpdesk and a user community to share experiences and further develop the DSS to meet user needs
will be provided under NCORE.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
Relevance. The project’s development objective was highly relevant for the riparian countries. The
project aimed to enhance analytical capacity for a basin wide perspective to support the development,
management and protection of Nile Basin water resources in a cooperative manner. In terms of design, the
DSS is a practical application of a prescriptive approach for NBI stakeholders and member countries to
make informed decisions, utilizing tools, methodologies and software. The DSS is an analytical tool
which enables the NBI and its member states to better understand river system behavior, dispelling mis-
perceptions and enabling a common perspective on the opportunities and challenges of basin management
and development. In a broader context, it is imperative to understand the political economy of
cooperation - and a sound knowledge base is a key element underpinning the benefits of river basin
cooperation. Capacity and knowledge, having the confidence and ability to negotiate a fair deal, and
having sufficient and correct information and knowledge to do so, is a key element in the risks and
opportunities, costs and benefits in of a cooperation framework to transboundary waters. 23




22
   The national application of the DSS in Uganda, Ethiopia and Kenya is supported by national water resources
management projects funded from IDA grants. This synergy between regional and national level activities is
extremely valuable to reinforce both and maximize effectiveness and efficiency of project resources. The projects
are the Uganda Water Management and Development project, the Ethiopia Tana-Beles Integrated Water Resources
Development project, and the Kenya Water Security & Climate Resilience project.

   World Bank (2012) Reaching Across the Waters – Facing the Risks of Cooperation in International Waters. Other
elements include accountability and voice; sovereignty and autonomy; equity and access; and stability and support.

                                                       21
The project’s objective was also relevant for global priorities. The stability and development of the Nile
region is of global significance. Eight of the eleven basin countries rank amongst the lowest globally for
GDP per capita with significant challenges of food security, energy security, and management of water
relates shocks such as droughts and floods. The Nile basin population of 238 million people accounts for
a quarter of the population of Sub-Saharan Africa (or half if the total country population is considered),
with an estimated 72% living in the rural areas. With the high dependency on subsistence rain-fed
agriculture for basic livelihoods and employment, and the uncertainty of future climate variability,
tackling the sustainable development of the region through an institutionalized approach to cooperative
management and development of the shared water resources is paramount. In addition, the Nile Basin
holds environmental assets of global significance including the Sudd swamps and Lake Victoria. These
need to be protected from the growing demands of water use and appropriately managed within a basin
wide framework such as provided by the NBI. The development of the Nile Basin DSS helps the riparian
countries to better understand, monitor and assess the state of the basin and the opportunities, constraints
and trade-offs for its sustainable management and development.

The project’s objective was relevant for the Bank’s regional assistance strategy. This recognizes the need
for regional cooperation to achieve poverty reduction and economic growth especially for land locked
countries. WRPMP strengthened NBI’s capacity to facilitate cooperative water resources management
and development by providing a common analytical platform to support informed decision making. The
project was also consistent with the commitment made by the Bank in its respective Country Assistance
Strategies and Water Resources Assistance Strategies to provide a framework for cooperative dialogue,
planning and preparation of future investments.

Counterfactual. The counterfactual can better inform the achievement of the objective - if a shared
understanding of the river is not developed, neither politics, nor economics, nor technology will help the
countries work together to reach achieve their goal of “sustainable socio-economic development through
equitable utilization of the and benefit from the common water resources.? Basins can also have sound
modeling capability but without the necessary and sufficient institutional conditions, this capability does
not either create a shared understanding or inform decision making.

There are a number of global examples which illustrate that indeed an improved knowledge base and
informed constituency can level the playing field and bring transparency to a decision making process.
Examples include:
      The DSS at BC Hydro in Canada: For more than fifteen years, BC Hydro has been developing
        and using a structured decision-making approach to make informed choices on multiple and
        sometimes competing objectives on water resources planning and management on the Columbia
        River. The process has for example has allowed kayakers, First Nations, and power-generation
        utilities to define issues and clarify trade-offs, while remaining focused on the triple bottom line
        of economics, environment and social priorities. This structured decision support system
        provided opportunities for dialogue, created a platform for cooperation, and resulted in a win-win
        outcome. BC Hydro managed to schedule planned flow releases with no loss in electricity
        generation or costs, kayaking’s popularity on the river tributaries were enhanced and increased,
        and First Nations continued to benefit from resources from the rivers.

       Investment opportunity analysis of the Zambezi Basin: In 2010, the World Bank released a report
        that examined the potential of the Zambezi River as an engine for sustainable multi-sectoral
        development for the eight countries in the river basin. The analytical framework adopted a
        modeling package which examined development scenarios for growth-oriented investments in
        hydropower and irrigation while fully taking into account water supply and sanitation, flood
        management, the environment, tourism and wetland management. A scenario-development


                                                    22
        economic assessment tool was used to provide riparian countries insight into options for joint or
        cooperative development as well as associated benefit sharing.

       Use of analysis for water sharing between Mexico and United States: The Interstate Basin Water
        Commission (IBWC) jointly administers the terms of the 1944 Water Treaty which guarantees
        Mexico’s annual water quantity from the Colorado River. A recent amendment (November 20,
        2012) to the 1944 Treaty, Minutes 319 guides future management of the Colorado River as part
        of the ongoing dialogue on water sharing issues. The significance of Minutes 319 is that the
        agreement was developed based on agreed upon and collaborated analytics. Every aspect of the
        data, such as what kind of data, how and when to collect the data, and model architecture was
        discussed, and shared by the engineers of the IBWC until both parties were in agreement, leaving
        little doubt regarding transparency of the data and outcome of the modeling.

Design and Implementation. The project design was sound and remained relevant throughout the
project duration. The components were appropriately related to and consistent with the stated PDO. As
indicated in section 2.1, and illustrated above, the design reflected the experiences and the lessons learned
from several international basins programs. It would have been useful during design to consider broader
application with versions for the public domain and for policy makers, rather than just the version for
technical experts. However in 2001 when the project was conceived and latterly designed, this was not
considered appropriate due to the nascent nature of basin wide cooperation for analysis and data sharing.
Similarly it may have been useful to focus on a range of easily-accessible non-highly technical knowledge
products during the development stage. In the context of a cooperation framework, the project design and
preparation was carried out in close cooperation with the NBI and riparian countries, to provide
accountability and a voice. Implementation supported sovereignty and autonomy in mainstreaming across
the NBI and the riparian countries, and equity and access achieved through the development of the Nile
DSS resulting in informed planning and decision-making. It is anticipated through this project, the
riparian countries can sustain stability and support, and this project will serve as a noteworthy example
for application in other basins. Thus is can be concluded that the project’s design and implementation
were highly relevant.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives

Progress towards achievement of the PDO
The Project Development Objective was fully achieved. The Nile Basin Initiative and its member states
have the analytical capacity for a basin wide perspective to support the development, management, and
protection of Nile Basin water resources in an equitable, optimal, integrated, and sustainable manner.
Assessment of achievement was based on the results framework indicators at objective and outcome
levels and their targets for the end of the project as described in the following tables.

At the start, the project was considered ambitious in terms of its scope and complexity particularly within
the challenging hydro-political context and historic lack of data and information sharing. The project
team has effectively and efficiently led the development of a common platform for basin wide
communication, information management and analysis of water resources to identify, assess and assist
decision makers to optimize water resources planning and development and to clarify potential impacts.

Progress towards achievement of outcomes

Outcome 1: DSS application
Outcome 1 was fully achieved. The DSS is a key building block for the WRM/D function of the NBI.
The DSS is used by the NBI and its member states for basin wide, sub basin and national analysis. Pilot
cases have been used to demonstrate both regional and national applications.

Transboundary applications have included to specific current issues and projects of relevance to the NBI
and Member States. These include:
     NELSAP-CU multi-sector investment program; an assessment of the cumulative economic, social
       and environmental impacts related to future scenarios for hydropower and irrigation development
       in the Nile Equatorial Lakes region
     ENTRO Joint Multi-Purpose Project; an investigation of the main infrastructure and water
       management developments on the Blue Nile considering various operating rules and climate
       change scenarios to assess the economic, social and environmental impacts
     Impact of development of the Sudd wetlands; an investigation of various options for the
       development and management of the Sudd water resources system and the resulting impacts to
       environmental and socio-economic indicators
     Integrated basin development; an assessment of full basin development coupled with various
       management options and operating rules

National applications have been completed in every Member State by the national DSS team. For
example, in Ethiopia an evaluation of the impact of irrigation developments in Tana and Beles sub-basins
on hydropower generation and lake navigation, and in Tanzania an evaluation of the effects of upstream
catchment development on the ecological functions of the downstream Kirumi wetland in the Mara sub-
basin. In addition, to support Member States to fully utilize the DSS in their national planning beyond the
Nile Basin.

Outcome 2 : Data and information
Outcome 2 was fully achieved. A significant amount of historic data and information from across the
basin countries has been shared by member countries and is now available to NBI. This includes
discharge, rainfall and water level data from over one thousand stations, with some data starting from
1911. The project team has completed extensive data gathering, gap filing and quality assurance to
provide comprehensive hydrological and meteorological data for the basin – now with more than forty
years of quality assured datasets. This is a significant change compared to start of project when data was
fragmented, in-complete, and not shared between countries. The Operational Guidelines on Interim
Procedures for Data and Information Sharing and Exchange were endorsed by the NileCOM in July 2011.
Implementation is ongoing.

A basin monitoring strategy was developed by the project team in consultation with the NileTAC and
endorsed by NileCOM in July 2012. This includes indicators for periodic monitoring and assessment of
state of the basin. The indicators formed the basis for the recently published first ever comprehensive
State of the Basin report by the NBI. The strategy also outlines the requirements for improvement of the
basin hydro-met system, with a consultancy to develop the design specifications planned under the new
NBTF/CIWA NCORE project.

Outcome 3: Sustainability
With a clear and early focus on mainstreaming the DSS within the institutional structures of the NBI and
the member countries, and with the demand from the three Centers and countries to utilize the DSS,
outcome 3 was fully achieved.

NileSEC is the permanent host for the DSS as NBI’s basin wide knowledge center. Its role is to maintain
and further develop the DSS for application to basin wide issues, as well as to support the two NBI sub
basin institutions (ENTRO and NELSAP-CU) and countries in their use of the DSS. With the fully
capable technical team in place, including key staff from the WRPMP, this work has already started under
the NCORE project with the NileSEC embarking on a strategic basin-wide assessment of the Nile Basin
water resources to support informed decision making and dialogue among the Nile Basin riparians.
Countries met in March 2013 to agree priorities within four categories:
    1. enhancing the knowledge understanding of the Nile River System; exploring issues such as water
        consummation through evaporation and transpiration, the blue-green water potentials, historic and
        current drought patterns, estimated future water demands, storage characteristics of natural water
        bodies.
    2. understanding major risks and transboundary issues; exploring issues such as the impacts of
        climate change, the location of hot spots, mitigation of droughts, opportunities for cooperative
        development.
    3. exploring policy issues to promote knowledge-based and informed cooperative management;
        exploring issues such as common norms and standards for sustaining environment and ecosystem
        services, a common definition of water security.
    4. harnessing basin opportunities to support cooperative and sustainable development; exploring
        issues such as impact of increasing water demands and planned developments, optimization
        across the basin, opportunities for water savings.

ENTRO and NELSAP-CU also have full capability to utilize the DSS and are already applying it to
planning. For example from 2013, ENTRO will use the DSS, along with other tools, to undertake a
Multi-Sectoral Opportunity Analysis and Integrated Development Plan for the Eastern Nile sub-basins
including analysis of options for hydropower and irrigation development potential and for analysis of
climate adaptation and mitigation measures, and to study salinity problems in the Nile Delta and seawater
intrusion.

Sustainability at the national level was assessed in relation to the development of a comprehensive
national integration plan, retention of qualified staff, financing, and adequacy of equipment. Of the nine
countries, seven were assessed as high and medium, with only two assessed as low. Whilst it remains
early days to be sure of sustainability at the national level, the assessment now provides a clear status of
achievement at the end of the project as well as a baseline for further engagement to support member
countries.

The Nile Basin DSS is a licensed based system. As part of the DSS development contract, NBI has a 150
licenses integrated with the proprietary MIKE modeling software from the consulting firm, DHI. These
licenses have been allocated within NBI itself and to Member States including to academic/research
institutions. There is demand for additional licenses which can be purchased under an agreement with
NBI, with or without the proprietary software.

In addition, as part of the development contract, DHI is providing ten years of maintenance and support to
the DSS after the expiration of the warranty period. This includes updates and upgrades of the software
system as new features are added and new versions are released, bug fixing, and updates of key technical
documentation.

Outcome 4: Project management
Outcome 4 was fully achieved. Throughout the project duration the project team demonstrated sound
work planning and budgeting, progress monitoring, financial management and procurement. With the
tight time schedule and a fully committed budget, the team delivered the project outputs as required.
There was regular engagement with the Bank team and with the Project Steering Committee to review
progress and provide guidance.

3.3 Efficiency
The efficiency of the project can be viewed as (i) the added value of undertaking the DSS at all; and/or
(ii) achieving results disproportionate to expected costs; and /or (iii) achieving the results in a least cost
manner (cost effectiveness).

(i)      The first approach is a valid basis in this project as its inception and implementation was
         innovative and, in some respects, a “leap of faith? (see section 2.2). Consequently, the efficiency
         of the project could be viewed as the value of the benefits of better decision-making.

         Whilst the PAD indicates that the broad benefits of cooperative Nile water management and
         development cover four key categories (see box 4), quantifying the value of incremental
         information and dialogue enabled by such information is unrealistic. The WRPM project is noted
         to generate substantial benefits by providing an analytical framework and tools to support basin
         wide planning and management of Nile water resources and related assets. Economic benefits
         derived from the project in the form of comprehensive information base, capacity building and
         training, analytical tools, and stakeholder involvement, are difficult to quantify in monetary terms.
         A cost-benefit analysis is not well suited to assess the impacts of technical assistance and capacity
         building operations such as this operation due to the problems in the quantification of intangibles
         and issues of attribution, such as estimation of the value of knowledge enhancement.


                                                       27
        Box 4 Benefits of cooperative water management and development
         The PAD indicated that the broad benefits of cooperative Nile water management and
         development fall into four categories:
            Environmental benefits derived from integrated river basin management;
            Direct economic benefits derived from better basin wide planning and development of water
             resources;
            Regional political benefits, in terms of increased stability and diminished tensions over river
             control issues;
            Indirect economic benefits, in apparently unrelated sectors, that are enabled by increased
             productivity and interaction, and decreased regional tensions.


        However, the nature of the decisions that the DSS supports and improves upon is significant,
        including the options for hydropower development. A minimal 2% reduction in costs (or equal
        increase in benefits) of one such project could translate into $50 million, which is three times of
        the value the WRPM project (phase 2) direct costs.

(ii)    By the second approach, the project achieved high efficiency since it was able to meet (and even
        exceed) targets by the closing date with full utilization of the budget. Of the phase II grant of
        US$17.2m, to 31 December 2012 US$17.1m (99%) was spent.

(iii)   It is difficult to develop rigorous assessments of cost effectiveness because each DSS is different
        and the capacity building and institution contexts vary significantly. However, the following is
        worth considering:
        o Costs compare favorably to the development of (roughly) similar decision support systems in
            other parts of the world: For example, the Government of Australia has invested
            US$150million to develop a new set of water modeling tools in the last decade.

        o The cost of individual consulting assignments to provide the same level of incremental
          information for each application could, in aggregate exceed the cost of the DSS. Within the
          WRPMP itself, substitute consulting assignments for a regional pilot application study and a
          national application study would likely average US$800,000 and US$300,000 respectively,
          exclusive of the consultative or capacity outputs and benefits. The forgone costs of such
          assignments, extrapolated to the six regional and eighteen national applications achieved
          within the WRMP project amounts to about $10 million or 60% of project costs. Extrapolating
          this with the planned continual use of the DSS at regional and national level in future,
          indicates that the investment cost of the DSS would soon be recovered. It would take the
          application of only eight more such regional applications to match project costs completely.
          Now that the DSS is developed, implemented and embedded in numerous decision-making
          institutions (e.g., Ministries of water), it is expected that this extension is not unreasonable and
          possibly an underestimate of the cost of more complex modeling required as countries
          investigate increasingly more complex projects and water management situations, such as
          climate change.

        o The capacity and tools enabled by the project provides the NBI and its Member States with a
          planning tool to identify, optimize and maximize transboundary water resources management
          and development investments which could amount to tens of billions of dollars. In addition


                                                     28
            the capability of the NB DSS to integrate climate change predictions will support the basin
            countries in their decision making on climate smart investments.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory
The outcome rating for the WRPMP is satisfactory based on its high relevance for the NBI and the
member countries, the achievement the objective and outcomes of the project, and the efficiency of
implementation.

Throughout the duration of the project, the rating has consistently been satisfactory. The final rating of
highly satisfactory is justified on the basis of the project results as well as in relation to the comparative
performance of the WRPMP to other NBTF projects including those already closed under the SVP.

The project concept to establish a DSS for the Nile Basin was sound (if ambitious at the time), data and
information was accessed from across all the basin countries for the first time, and this provided the basis
for exploring understanding and developing different scenarios at basin and sub-basin as well as at
national levels. Whilst the project supported the development of the DSS and built capacity for its use,
the test of its sustainability is still to come. All indications are that the likelihood of sustainability is good.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
 (a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
Development of sound water resources policies, as well as the identification, planning, and management
of sustainable water-related projects, has significant social and poverty alleviation implications in the Nile
Basin. It is important that regional development projects and activities reflect social concerns, reinforce
cultural and social values, and conserve and protect the environment. The WRPM project supported
regional dialogue and the development of common tools to explore alternative development paths from
regional and sub-regional perspectives, thereby contributed to sustainable land and resources management
and poverty reduction. The project also developed common approaches, as well as improving the
information needed, to assess the social and environmental impacts of future NBI and related projects.
The project itself, because of its focus on building capacity and technical tools, had limited opportunities
for employment, income generation and poverty reduction. Similarly, it did not have any direct adverse
social impacts.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening
As indicated in section 2.5, the impact on long term capacity and institutional development has been
positive, and was mainstreamed throughout the project at basin, sub-basin and national levels.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)
     WRPMP strengthened cross-NBI collaboration on cooperative management and development
        issues and learning. Due to the nature of WRPMP engaging across NBI, the project built
        collaboration on DSS issues and applications among the NBI Centers and with other project
        teams. This helped to integrate project outcomes (eg ENPM models, RATP agricultural model)
        bringing enhanced benefit and value for money.
     As a first of its kind, the development of the DSS has generated much opportunity and interest in
        learning for application in other basins in the region and beyond.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Substantial
Risks to the future sustainability of project outcomes have been thoroughly explored by the project team
and were taken into account during the last year. Assessment of the risks and mitigation measures
includes:

a) Lack of technical acceptance of the DSS as a common platform. All indications are that all member
   states appreciate and accept the technical quality of the DSS, noting their involvement in its
   development and the engagement of national staff. There may be concerns about data quality but
   these can be addressed as deficiencies are identified and data exchange continues.

b) Lack of acceptance of the results of application of the DSS in future. Countries have been engaged in
   scoping and deciding cases for application of the DSS to address issues and challenges in the Nile
   Basin as part of the development of the work plan for the Nile Secretariat’s WRM Department.
   Compelling information to inform understanding will be generated, including the economic, social
   and environmental implications. International experts will support identification of key issues for
   analysis.

c) Inadequate usage of the DSS by the SAPs. Both SAPs have plans for the DSS in relation to
   identification and planning of project opportunities. Capacity is considered to be good in NELSAP-
   CU and ENTRO to effectively utilize the DSS.

d) National sustainability is poor in some countries. Based on assessments at the end of the project it is
   anticipated that two member states may struggle to fully utilize and gain benefits from the DSS. The
   WRM Department at the Secretariat will periodically monitor sustainability, encourage utilization of
   the DSS Help Desk and engagement with the network of users, and promote linkages with the SAPs
   to build capacity as part of specific project development.

e) Inadequate resources for continual updating. The DSS tools and data will need to be continually
   updated and developed to respond and remain relevant to user needs, the cooperation environment,
   and demand for public access. This will require human and financial resources.

f) New data is not forthcoming by member states. The NileSEC will promote the full implementation of
   the Interim Procedures for Data & Information Sharing and Exchange. In the short term, it is
   expected that member states will avail data as required in relation to project identification and
   development needs.

g) Inadequate financing for DSS application in the NileSEC and SAPs. In the short term, the financing
   is assured by the new NBTF/CIWA NCORE project. In the medium term, increasing member state
   contributions will cover the cost of minimum functionality. It is also expected that the NBI will
   attract financing from organizations wishing to undertake analysis such as for climate change studies.

h) Loss of NileSEC WRM Department core staff. The transition arrangements beyond WRPMP were
   well-planned and already effective prior to closure, particularly with the transfer of the WRPMP Lead
   DSS Specialist to be the Head of the WRM Unit at NileSEC. In the medium-term, capacity will be
   institutionalized and broadened within the NileSEC to ensure continuity should staff leave. In
   addition, the introduction of the new NBI human resources policy and a new salary and benefits scale
   should help to ensure NBI is competitive in the regional market.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank performance during design and preparation of the project is rated as satisfactory. The Bank
team had expertise and experience in preparing the project and had very good relations with the NBI. The
Bank’s knowledge of major international basins and previous operations in the Nile Basin were used well
to shape the design with a logical flow of outputs to outcome to objective and appropriate components.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory
The Bank performance during supervision is rated as Satisfactory. Regular implementation support
missions were undertaken as well as joining specific key workshops such as on DSS sustainability. The
Bank team was supportive and encouraging, providing guidance and identifying issues for further
attention by the project team and helping to problem solve. An example was the support provided to the
WRPMP team and the NileSEC to develop a paper on mainstreaming the DSS into the NileSEC WRM
Unit which was approved by NileTAC. In addition, the Bank hired technical specialists to support the
project team including DSS and software experts for advice on climate change scenarios and datasets,
review of Work Package 2 pilot application results, review of cost benefit analysis tool, feedback on
technical policy documents, review of maintenance and support plan, and advice on intellectual property
issues related to future software development. Fiduciary responsibilities were effectively carried out,
with constructive support from the Bank country office for financial management and procurement.
Briefings on review findings were provided by the TTL to the Project Steering Committee as part of the
annual meeting.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall rating for Bank performance is assessed to be satisfactory. Supervision was considered to be
appropriate, proactive and supportive.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Moderately Satisfactory
For the purposes of the ICR, since WRPMP was a project under the Nile Basin Initiative - a partnership
by the governments of ten countries - the ‘government’ is taken to mean the NBI member countries as
represented by the Nile Technical Advisory Committee (NileTAC) and the Project Steering Committee,
(PSC) both with representation from all member states. The overarching issue reflecting government
performance was the freeze in participation by two Member States in 2010. Egypt and Sudan no longer
engaged in regional project activities such as Project Steering Committee meetings and DSS technical
trainings. However engagement was maintained at the national level including with the project funded
staff within the host ministry.

The NBI overall performed satisfactorily in supporting the WRPM project, including review and approval
of key documents (e.g. the data and information sharing protocol and the DSS sustainability plan). The
NileTAC also responded to requests from the WRPMP team for release of required data under the agreed
interim procedures. Some decisions could have been swifter such as agreement of the functionality and
staffing of the WRM Unit at the NileSEC as the long term institutional host for the DSS. The PSC was
well chaired by Ethiopia as the host country and had largely consistent representation from the member
states which brought good continuity.

                                                   31
(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Highly Satisfactory
The implementing agency was the Project Management Unit in Addis Ababa, led by the Regional Project
Manager with an expert professional technical team. Performance of the PMU is assessed to be highly
satisfactory. This is based on the full achievement of the projects objective within budget and on time,
whilst managing the most institutionally complex project in NBIs portfolio. The PMU worked with the
three NBI Centers and with the MoWR in nine countries, with over fifty professional staff employed
throughout the basin as well as support staff. The WRPM project had strong financial management and
procurement, with 99% of the budget spent on completion of the project.

The WRPM project was the most technically demanding project in NBIs portfolio. The in-house team
achieved the design and delivery of DSS with full functionality on time and to cost. This was a
substantial achievement due to the commitment and dedication of the core team. Through building good
working relations with DHI, the consulting organization who developed the DSS, the WRPM team was
able to proactively manage problems and slippage by addressing design & functionality problems
together. The Panel of Experts reported that ‘The management team has demonstrated exceptional
professionalism, both with respect to the technical as well as the contractual and management aspects of
the DSS development.

 (c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
The overall rating of the NBIs performance is satisfactory. This reflects the achievement of the projects
objective and its full expenditure. The NBI and project staff was very appreciative of WRPMP and what
it had enabled them to achieve, underpinning the analytical capability of the NBI and its member states.
There is now considerable momentum and enthusiasm to take the DSS to the next stage of its application
to inform decision making for cooperative management and development.

6. Lessons Learned
A number of lessons emerge from the WRPMP related to: project rationale; DSS development;
sustainability. These have been developed with input from the Bank’s global analysis; specific questions
from similar projects in preparation in Bank; and from Bank/NBI teams and experts involved in Nile.

Project rationale
(i)    A decision support system stimulates more rigorous water management. The project was
       conceived and designed on the assumption that countries need to have a commonly accepted
       knowledge base and analytical tools to enable improved understanding and informed discussions
       about water resources management and development opportunities, challenges and trade-offs. This
       builds trust and confidence, breaks myths through sound analysis and information, and forms the
       technical knowledge platform for advancing cooperation. The experience of the WRPMP supports
       this view – that, in building the DSS, latent demand for better knowledge and understanding has
       emerged, as indicated by the early application and uptake by functional units in participating
       countries.

(ii)   A DSS stimulates cooperation by reducing the risks. This existence of this latent demand as a
       core feature of transboundary water management was identified in a recent World Bank global




                                                   32
        study.24 Specifically, access to the same information and tools helps to level the playing field and
        to ensure all the countries are confident in making decisions. Particularly across a basin with many
        riparians such as the Nile Basin, a wide disparity in capacity can be expected and needs to be
        proactively addressed, with additional support where required. In fact, the global study identifies
        “Knowledge and Skills? as the appropriate strategy to reduce three of the five core risks of
        cooperation for individual countries, namely: (i) accountability and voice (the risk of not having a
        say in decision-making in the governing structure of any regional entity); (ii) equity and access (the
        risk of entering into an unfavorable distribution of benefits including timing of benefits and costs
        and obtaining/retaining fair access to river resources; and (iii) capacity and knowledge (confidence
        in the ability to negotiate a fair deal due to lack of enough an correct information). Capacity and
        knowledge is linked to a fourth risk, namely the ability to act in the best interest of the country
        without constraints, making decisions independently (sovereignty and autonomy).

(iii)   The benefits of a DSS take time to emerge. Whilst over ten years since its inception, the Nile
        Basin Initiative through the WRPM project has just achieved this analytical capacity and has
        completed some useful transboundary case studies, it is recognized as only the start. It is the
        application of the DSS over the next few years that are expected to reap the substantial benefits for
        cooperative management and development of the Nile Basin.

(iv)    The risk of a “hermit DSS? can be mitigated by connecting the analysis to the
        diplomatic/political agenda. As a highly technical exercise by specialists, the development of a
        DSS runs the risk of being isolated and separated from its rationale. To avoid this, development of
        the DSS was a highly participatory process involving the riparian countries and in particular a key
        design feature of the project was to support capacity building for DSS use at a national level. This
        aimed to ensure understanding as well as relevance of the DSS to riparian issues. At the regional
        level, the NBI was engaged in identifying and developing some key pilot applications to highlight
        pertinent water management and development issues. This demonstrated the capability of the DSS
        for analysis of complex issues, comparison of scenarios and optimization on specific parameters.
        In this way, the DSS retained its relevance despite the long development period and its highly
        technical nature. Post WRPMP, a recent consultation with the NileTAC has identified a range of
        key issues for analysis to build understanding of the basin hydrology, and the management and
        development opportunities, challenges and trade-offs. This helps to provide a sound technical basis
        for broader political discussions on water related issues.

(v)     Providing public access accelerates and broadens the benefits – and hence rationale – for the
        core DSS. Public access to the tools and data is important to spread and maximize knowledge and
        understanding across the basin beyond the riparian governments. Partly due to the fledging status
        of cooperation at the time of the projects’ conception, and partly due to the limited capacity and
        access to technology at the time, the WRPMP did not aim to develop the DSS as a public domain
        tool. Its use is restricted to license holders only, registered by the NBI. With the rapid increase in
        access to technology and the internet as well as the growing capability for analysis, options for
        greater public access are now being considered.

Project implementation
The development of the DSS is a complex undertaking technically and politically. Lessons from
WRPMP are:

(vi)   The business process for water resources decision making is at once an important starting
       condition but also a product of the project itself. Linkages to the decision-making officials for
       water management provide a clear guide for DSS development. It should be visible at the outset.
       When the WRPM project was initially envisaged in 2000, although the NBI had been formed it was
       clearly a transitional mechanism with a mandate for managing projects and programs. Now, over
       12 years later and still transitional, greater trust and confidence has been built among member
       countries, NBI has gained more acceptance and has better defined its core functions (partly as a
       result of the DSS). As a consequence the business process for decision making is much clearer. If
       the business process cannot be identified early, a substantial judgment call is required to commit the
       required funding in advance of this clarity.

(vii) A participatory process is a core ingredient in success. Development of the DSS as a
      participatory process enabled technical interaction across all of the Nile Basin countries for the first
      time. This included development of data and information sharing protocols, use of the DSS tools,
      and development of the test applications at regional and national levels. This was critical to
      ensuring: (a) trust in the DSS; (b) DSS design that meets the needs and priorities of all countries;
      (c) capacity in all participating countries; and (d) early demonstrations and institutional
      development to support long term sustainability.

(viii) Developing data and information sharing protocols is critical and can be helped by global
       public data sets and development of the DSS itself. At the start of WRPMP in 2005, the NBI
       countries did not have a data sharing arrangement and there was little indication that this would
       occur during the life of the project. The project team started data collection on an incremental
       basis, gaining data from public domain sources such as published studies. In recognition of the
       need for a formal arrangement, NileCOM instructed the NBI to prepare a protocol for data sharing,
       which was followed by operational guidelines. In parallel to the formal arrangements, the project
       team was proactive in accessing the required data for the testing of successive DSS releases,
       resulting in substantial sharing of data from all of the basin countries. This is viewed as a clear
       indication of the growing trust and confidence, as well as the commitment, to Nile cooperation by
       the riparians. This needs to be further strengthened in the future to make more of these data public
       domain.

(ix)   Development of a DSS and the required capacity to sustain its application requires substantial
       financial and human resources, and time – especially if it is to be based on consensus. For
       example, the conception of the need for a DSS was agreed in 2000, the project was designed with
       effectiveness achieved in 2005 and completion in 2012 – in total 12 years - with an overall project
       budget of US$24 million. Similarly for data sharing, the NileCOM requested the development of a
       protocol in May 2006, it was approved protocols in July 2009, and then operational guidelines
       approved in in July 2011.

(x)    The Bank team brings significant technical support and encouragement. It thus requires
       adequate long term resources, appropriate team skills-mix, and attention to continuity of staff.
       There needs to be a better way to draw upon Bank professionals across the Bank for such flagship
       activities.




                                                     34
(xi)    Role of the basin professionals compared with international consultants should be carefully
        considered. The development of the Nile Basin DSS was driven ‘in-house’ by an expert team who
        proactively managed the international consultants for the development of the DSS with often
        collaborative problem solving. This was to avoid a final product which had limited ownership,
        limited understanding of what was in the box, limited capacity and costly outsourcing for any for
        future development25.

(xii) A DSS should be inclusive of the range of development concerns and priorities, adopting a
      “triple bottom line? scope. Analytical capability should extend beyond hydrology to include
      environmental, social and economic parameters to be able to most effectively support decision
      making. This requires the countries to agree on the relevant parameters and relationships such as
      the economic value of environmental assets.

(xiii) The DSS should embed as early as possible in the long term institutional host. Whilst the
       preparation of the DSS was undertaken by a PMU, the long term host institution is the Nile Basin
       Initiative Secretariat. With hindsight, it may have been better to have integrated the PMU within
       the NileSEC from the start, building its capacity as well as credibility as a basin wide knowledge
       center. Whether a regional host institution is required at the very beginning for the development of
       a DSS is debatable depending on the basin context. The WRPMP envisaged a regional
       DSS/knowledge center and originally did not explicitly link this to the NileSEC due to its fledging
       and interim nature. The primary need is to be adaptable within the context and not to delay DSS
       development until a perfect host is available.

Sustainability
The risk of investing such a substantial amount of money and time in the development of a DSS is that to
achieve value for money, its continued (and expanded) use, maintenance, and keeping it relevant is
essential. Putting conditions into place for such sustainability is a complex challenge in and of itself.

(xiv) The development of a DSS should be seen as part of a long term process and one part of the
      overall engagement with a basin. With the significant effort to develop the DSS, a continued
      effort (and funding) is needed to ensure its extended application and use across the basin. This
      cannot always be included in the project scope itself, as with the project duration already six years,
      it was not considered feasible to further increase the duration to include a final phase focused on
      application. The institutional setting at both regional and national levels is important for
      sustainability as is early preparation for project completion. During development of the DSS,
      demonstration or pilot applications and engaging a wider community (such as academia, public –
      see v above) are good supplements to ensuring ongoing application as is the use of the DSS in
      preparing Bank projects. More broadly, DSS development should not be viewed as an isolated
      activity compared to other aspects of basin engagement. The WRPMP was one of a number of
      projects supporting NBI and together they made up a comprehensive package of interlinked
      activities.

(xv) A DSS is a living asset that requires ongoing adaptation, refinement and software. Whilst a
     DSS can be versatile with ‘plug and play’ capability to use other models, in order to keep up to date
     in a rapidly changing modeling environment, new software for the required interfaces will need to
     be developed – and hence the institution ideally needs to retain in-house software development
     capacity. It also requires the institution to have the original software codes. This was addressed for


25
     An earlier more basic DSS tool developed for the Nile Basin suffered from all of these problems.

(c) Other partners and stakeholders
There is wide spread appreciation of extent of and value of work done under the WRPM project. The
achievements, professionalism and hard work of the WRPM project team has been acknowledged by the
Project Steering Committee, the Nile TAC, national host institutions, and by the Panel of Experts. Some
quotes are:

‘The DSS is a valuable tool for the MoW&E in Ethiopia. We are developing the water resources in this
country and it is a challenge due to the regional nature of many of our rivers. The DSS enables us to
analyze and evaluate options for WRM & D taking into account the various interests of stakeholders.
This enables senior officials to have a sound basis for decision making. I am proud of the NBI project
team who are developing the DSS and supporting us to gain the expert capacity to use and sustain it.’ Ato
Fekahmed Negash, Director, River Basin Management Directorate, MoW&E, Ethiopia and Chair of the
WRPM Project Steering Committee.

‘As a member of the steering committee of the project, I have witnessed the NB DSS evolving into a state
of the art analytic framework developed through participation of the Nile riparians. I am pleased to say
that the NB DSS is already being taken up as the tool for water resources planning, development and
management in Uganda.’ Dr Callist Tindimugaya, Commissioner of Water Resources Regulation and
Planning, WRM Directorate, MoW&E, Uganda and WRPM PSC member.

‘As it is today the DSS should serve as a valuable, and state-of-the-art, tool for evaluating alternative
water management policies and infrastructure designs, performing trade-off analyses among multiple
objectives, and for promoting informed discussions among various planners and policy makers. There is
little doubt that the Nile Basin countries can now be better informed of the interdependence of various
components of the water resource systems in each country and their impacts in other countries.’ DSS
Panel of Experts; Dr Thinus Basson, Professor Peter Loucks, Professor Ezio Todini.

‘It’s been my privilege to have witnessed the building of a DSS for the Nile Basin that is now accepted
and being successfully used by multiple stakeholders to achieve a better understanding of the potential
hydrologic, economic, environmental, ecologic and social impacts of alternative development,
management and water use policies and practices.’ Professor Peter Loucks, member of the POE, Cornell
University, USA.

                Water Resources Planning & Management Project (Phase 2)
                  NBI Project Completion Report - Executive Summary

The WRPM project context
The Nile riparians launched in 1997 the process for the establishment of a permanent legal and
institutional framework for the cooperation on the Nile. The extensive consultation and
negotiation processes that were undertaken led to the recognition of the importance of accurate
data, information and commonly shared analytical tools as a means of providing sound technical
basis for joint decision making at regional and sub-regional levels. Such common analytic tools
didn’t exist when the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) was launched; the countries did not share data
and information. The prevalent asymmetry in information and capacity of riparian technicians
among NBI countries needed appropriately tailored capacity building program. Therefore, Water
Resources Planning and Management (WRPMP) project was designed to fill the gaps in analytic
capacity (tools, databases, and trained personnel) for the identification and planning of multi-
country water resources management and development projects.

The WRPMP was one of the eight projects under the Shared Vision Program. The project was
officially launched in January 2006 and executed in two phases; Phase I was completed in April
2009 and phase II ran from May 2009 to December 2012. The Nile Basin Trust Fund
(administered by the World Bank) funded both phases with a total of USD24.0 million. NBI
member country in-kind contributions estimated as USD2.6 million.

Achievement of the Project Development Objective (PDO)
The PDO was to enhance analytical capacity for a basin wide perspective to support the
development, management, and protection of Nile Basin water resources in an equitable, optimal,
integrated, and sustainable manner.

The Nile Basin Decision Support System (NB DSS) is the major output of the WRPMP Phase II.
The DSS has been developed as a state of the art comprehensive software (analytic) framework
designed to meet the needs of complex water resources planning and management in multi-
stakeholder, multi-country settings. The DSS offers the Nile Basin countries with the data and
toolset for information management, modeling, scenario analysis, and multi-criteria decision
making in water resources.

With NB DSS, for the first time in the Nile Basin, the riparians now have a common analytic
framework they can use to jointly develop and manage their shared water resources of the Nile
Basin; one of the pre-requisites for joint water resources planning in a transboundary context.
Using the DSS, the riparians can explore possible future water resources development and
management scenarios, quantify possible impacts and benefits from alternative water resources
development and management plans, evaluate tradeoffs, determine optimal configuration of
future plans that result in win-win development and management paths. With the DSS, the
riparians have an objective basis for integrating environmental and socio-economic objectives in
their water resources plans and a rational basis for joint decision making. The DSS provides the
riparians a framework which can be used to exchange information among the NBI countries and
thereby enhance joint and collaborative water resources analysis.

  The Nile Basin Decision Support System
  The NB DSS is the first of its kind – not only in the Nile Basin but also worldwide. It is a
  comprehensive software framework designed to meet the requirements of complex water
  resources planning. It provides diverse toolsets for data processing, water resources modeling,
  scenario management, optimization and multi-criteria decision making. It offers tools for
  integrating environmental, social and economic objectives thus greatly facilitating multi-sector
  water resources planning at small catchment and river basin levels. The NB DSS integrates
  data management, GIS, modeling and scenario analysis, as well as optimization and multi-
  criteria decision making toolset. With its flexible software framework and open architecture,
  it can be extended to add new functionalities and modeling tools to meet emerging needs
  without major change to the program code. This enhances sustainability of the DSS in that it
  can be expanded to meet emerging requirements.

Through early applications of the DSS at both national and transboundary levels, the DSS has
already started providing valuable insights that enhanced common understanding of the water
resources base of the Nile Basin. Models and data from NB DSS have been used in the Nile
Equatorial Lakes Multi-Sectoral Investment Opportunity Analysis (MSIOA) and to support the
preparation of the Eastern Nile Joint Multipurpose Program of the Eastern Nile. The national
applications of the DSS have demonstrated that the DSS shall be a great asset also for water
resources planning at national level.

The WRPM project led the development of the Nile Basin Data and Information Sharing and
Exchange Interim Procedures, which was endorsed by the Nile-COM. This is the first time Nile
Basin countries agreed on a data sharing arrangements. Nearly all data needed for testing and
applying the DSS was provided by the riparian countries through the data sharing agreement.
Through the WRPM project, NBI countries have also agreed on a strategy for strengthening river
basin monitoring.

Core technical capacity has been built in all riparian countries that the countries can draw on to
make use of the DSS both at national level as well as at transboundary level. As a result, a
nascent team of technical professionals have been created that applied the DSS on a number of
national pilot cases. Thus, the DSS development has helped in forming a community of technical
professionals around NB DSS.

During the consolidation phase of the project, the DSS has been transferred to the Water
Resources Management Department at the NBI Secretariat (NileSEC), which has built a core
technical capacity to administer the DSS, apply the tool and support DSS users at basin-wide.
Necessary arrangements have been put in place in each national ministry of water affairs for
running the DSS to address practical water resources problems from national as well as
transboundary perspectives. Sustainability of the DSS beyond its development stage is ensured at
regional level and in many of the riparian countries.

Through the newly launched NBTF/CIWA funded Nile Cooperation for Results (NCORE)
project, the NileSEC has budgeted specific activities to maintain the DSS and support its
applications at regional and national levels. Preparations are underway to form a DSS user
community to sustain and further nurture the capacities built through the DSS development
process.


                                                46
Achievement of outcomes
The project achieved all the four expected outcomes:

Outcome 1: Nile Basin DSS applied on selected key water resources planning/management
projects in the Nile Basin and results used to inform decision making
The Nile Basin Decision Support System is now operational at regional, sub-regional and national
levels. The DSS was officially inaugurated as the common Nile Basin countries analytic
framework by the Nile Council of Ministers (Nile-COM) in July 2012. All necessary license,
warranty, maintenance and support arrangements have been put in place; the DSS has a no-cost
maintenance and support agreement with the developer until 2023 – thereby greatly enhancing
its’ sustainability without financial burden on the NBI countries.

The DSS has been applied on 7 transboundary and 18 national pilot application cases. The
primary objective of these pilot applications was to test the DSS as well as to demonstrate use of
the DSS for solving practical water resources problems, build capacity for using NB DSS, and
enhance awareness among senior officials on the value of the DSS. For example, the Integrated
Assessment Pilot Case which covered the entire Nile Basin aimed to assess the potential
implications of unilateral development in the Nile Basin. The current (baseline) and six possible
future scenarios were analyzed, reflecting how the Nile Basin water resources development might
evolve and its potential implications. This included 27 proposed dams, 13 new irrigation schemes
and a number of hydropower plants and, in this regard, covered most of the key water
infrastructure development planned for future. The implications were estimated using the
indicators that were agreed with stakeholders. The overall messages for decision makers were
clearly drawn out; the economic impacts associated with the full development of the Nile Basin in
terms of hydropower and irrigation are mainly as a result of consumptive water use, changed flow
regimes and increased losses due to operating rules. Average annual flows along the lower
Atbara and Blue Nile rivers will be significantly reduced, as will the inflow into Aswan Dam. The
fully developed basin will also result in significant social and environmental impacts related to
loss in recession agriculture, less fish production, reduction in wetland areas and increased
ecological stress. Irrigation expansion upstream of Lake Victoria as an alternative to further
irrigation expansion in the lower Main Nile and/or Blue Nile catchments holds significant
potential in terms of water efficiency, and also has negligible impacts along the White Nile and
Main Nile rivers. The most significant negative impacts associated with irrigation expansion in
the Lake Victoria Basin, relate to the anticipated decrease in the area of the Sudd Wetland.

The DSS has also been used to support investment planning at a sub basin level by the two NBI
Subsidiary Action Program offices, NELSAP-CU and ENTRO. The quality assured datasets and
models from NB DSS were used in the Multi-Sectoral Investment Opportunities Analysis by
NELSAP-CU to inform investment strategy development. NB DSS, due to its flexibility, is
already serving as the analytic platform to which the Agriculture Model developed by the
Regional Agriculture Trade Project has been integrated. In addition, the DSS has been applied on
more than 18 national cases to demonstrate its value and explore water resources management
and development opportunities – both within the Nile Basin and in other basins. These include
water resources development for hydropower in the Kagunuzi sub-basin in Burundi, a multi-
purpose reservoir on the Ndembera river in the Rufiji Basin in Tanzania and impacts of climate
change on the inflow to the High Aswan Dam in Egypt. Over ten workshops have been
conducted at regional and national levels to present results of applying the NB DSS on regional
and national projects to the key policy/decision makers in the Nile Basin.
The Nile Basin countries are now equipped with their jointly developed analytic framework with
substantial knowledge base vital for transboundary Water Resources planning and management
benefiting from the WRPMP’s products.

                                               47
Outcome 2: Relevant data and information are shared
By the time the WRPM project started, there were four main challenges with respect to data
needed for testing and application of NB DSS. First, NBI didn’t have any substantial compiled
datasets with which the project could start. Second, there was no agreed mechanism for accessing
data available within NBI member states. Third, ground observation (hydro-meterological) data
was not available for some parts of the basin; in some countries, such as Rwanda and South
Sudan, many of the ground observation stations were not operational. Fourth, the data from
various countries had varying quality with data from certain regions exhibiting lots of breaks in
the records. Therefore, the WRPM project focused its activities along all the four fronts.

The WRPM project led the development of the Nile Basin Data and Information Sharing and
Exchange Interim Procedures, which was endorsed by the Nile-COM. This is the first time Nile
Basin countries agreed on a data sharing arrangements.

Nearly all data needed for testing and applying the DSS was provided by the riparian countries
through the data sharing agreement. Through the WRPM project, NBI countries have also agreed
on a strategy for strengthening river basin monitoring. The project compiled 40 years of quality
assured datasets based on the data shared by NBI member countries. In addition, a considerable
volume of data has been compiled and processed to support testing and application of the DSS.
The WRPM project has also developed a guidelines for data quality & data assurance to serve the
NBI countries. All these data and information produced through DSS application have been made
available to all NBI countries and NBI programs.

Outcome 3: Appropriate institutional, technical and financial arrangements for sustained
DSS operational use
Nile Basin DSS is a flexible analytic framework that can cater for needs of water resources
planning and management at different scales. In this regard, developing the DSS was not an end
by itself. Ensuring sustainability of the analytic framework and its operational use was vital for
the future of water resources development and management in the Nile Basin. The WRPM
project put the DSS in good footing with respect to its sustainability. Well in advance of project
completion, the project prepared a well thought out DSS sustainability plan that was approved by
NBI governance. Sustainability was agreed to focus on maintaining the analytic framework (with
the necessary technical support) and the practical use of the system to address water resources
issues in the Nile Basin.

Guided by a well thought out plan for sustaining the DSS, the WRPMP put in place the necessary
arrangements to sustain the DSS beyond project completion. It was agreed with the governance
that the primary responsibility for maintaining and administering the DSS should lie with the NBI
Secretariat while the system should be used at national, sub-regional and regional levels. Thus,
sustainability requirements at three levels differed commensurate to the primary focus at each
level. The Nile-Sec, being responsible for maintaining, administering and applying the DSS had
the biggest requirements for sustaining the DSS. NBI centers at sub regional level and national
institutions focus primarily on applying the DSS and largely have the necessary technical and
financial resources to support the operational application of the DSS.

At the regional level, the DSS has been transferred to the NBI Secretariat where under the WRM
Department, a regional DSS unit has started operation to administer, maintain, apply and further
develop the DSS as new requirements emerge. A system of national and regional DSS networks
was established in all NBI countries and received technical training on application of NB DSS to
water resources problems. Under the new NBI five year program, NBI has allocated funding for

                                                48
establishing DSS help desk, providing technical training and backstopping and support users
basin-wide.

The DSS is deployed in all NBI countries and the two SAPs with the support of the NileSEC.
Using a combination of technical, institutional and financial aspects, the sustainability of the DSS
has been rated as high in all NBI Centers. Seven out of nine NBI countries have been rated as
medium to high in the sustainability rating scale. This was a good result considering the wide
differences in capacity. Some limited support will be available in future to continue supporting
application of the DSS at a national level and as opportunities arise, linkages with the SAPs for
DSS application on specific projects will be developed.

Outcome 4: Effective and efficient project management
The Water Resources Planning and Management project was the most technically complex and
institutionally challenging project of all the NBI Shared Vision Program hence had significant
management challenges. It successfully completed the development of a state of the art decision
support system under complex institutional setup, at times, in very sensitive transboundary
cooperation environment. The project management was proactive in taking the appropriate
actions to avoid or reduce risks/challenges faced by the project. The project has been completed
on time and to budget achieving all its expected outcomes. The project kept the key stakeholders,
particulalry the Steering Committee, fully involved in the project through regular and extra-
ordinary Steering Committee meetings and regular monthly, quarterly, semi-annaul and annual
reports as well as ad-hoc reports. The project also conducted annual review mission to the NBI
countries to identify the challenges and problems in the implementation of the project activities at
national level and take the necessary action to resolve the problms in consultation with the
Steering Committee member and Technical Advisory Committee member (Nile-TAC). Annual
review mission conducted to the project by the World Bank and other Development Partners to
review the project progress and provide guidance on the issues and botlnecks. The project was
consistently rated by the Work Bank review mission as satisfactory and last mission rated the
project as highly satisfactory.

A number of project adaptive project management measures contributed to the on-time, within
budget completion of the project thereby achieving the expected outcome of effective and
efficient project management. These included strong quality orientation, maintaining a strong
and coherent project team, appropriate phasing of DSS development with a strong relationship
with the development consultant, early planning to minimize risk such as data availability, and
effective engagement of the PSC.

The project was value for money
The development of the analytic capacity across NBI and its member countries was a major
investment and is considered to be good value for money.
- The Nile Basin countries have huge untapped water resources development potentials worth
    billions of dollars in the next ten years. Developing these potentials in a manner that would
    result mutual benefits requires robust analytic systems and the DSS provides the necessary
    analytic tools for planning of water resources development investments.
- The DSS is a generic tool that can be applied at different scales; it supports water resources
    planning at country level and, as a result, contributes towards implementation of integrated
    water resources management at national level.
- The technical analytical capacity built through the project has created a nascent team of
    technicians that would greatly contribute to water resources planning and management in
    NBI countries thereby contributing to sound water resources management basin-wide,


                                                49
-   The DSS enables analysis of the implications of climate change scenarios on investment
    planning and consequently enables NBI member countries to develop ‘climate smart’ options.
    This could reduce the risk of ineffective use of financial resources from over or under
    engineered infrastructure designs.
-   At a national level, the DSS enables member states to better understand, manage and develop
    their water resources as well as to assess the implications from a transboundary perspective.

Challenges
The main challenges faced by WRPMP and mitigation measures were:
 Lack of formal arrangement for data sharing: the project team started data compilation from
   public domain sources early in the DSS development and gained approval from the NileCOM
   to prepare a data sharing procedures in May 2006. This was developed and endorsed, with
   the subsequent development of implementation guidelines with endorsement in July 2011
 Lack of clear business process to guide DSS design: at project initiation, NBI did not have a
   structured workflow for a water resources decision making process. This lack of clear
   business process posed challenge in scoping the DSS as the potential future uses define the
   scope. The project team adopted a generic but flexible workflow that captures key steps in
   water resources decision making. This was done as part of the comprehensive needs
   assessment and was later endorsed as part of the DSS conceptual design and development
   plan. During the detailed design stage, the project team also developed a set of use cases that
   capture key types of uses of the DSS and a generic profile of DSS users. This information
   helped in adequately scoping NB DSS.
 Balancing process with results: A key requirement of the DSS development process was that
   it should be participatory to ensure riparian ownership as a common analytic tool. Developing
   the DSS through a process where all assumptions, methodologies and technical descriptions
   are agreed upon would have been an impossible task. Therefore, striking the right level of
   stakeholder involvement that ensured transparency but didn’t compromise delivery of results
   was a major achievement.
 Appropriate selection of consultants to develop the DSS: It was clear from the beginning that
   the project would involve major software development. Traditionally, modeling tools have
   been developed by engineering firms on a ‘fit for purpose’ basis, i.e. with little emphasis on
   using modern software development process. Sustainability of the DSS required long-term
   commitment from the contractor for providing a maintenance service and keeping the DSS
   updated continuously. Therefore, selecting the type of contractor was one of the challenging
   tasks faced by the project. From a market scan and pre-qualification, a long list of firms was
   developed comprised of three types of firms; i) purely software development companies, ii)
   those with customized solutions for water resources planning/management, and iii) those with
   off-the-shelf modeling and related tools. The resulting short list enabled a good response.
 Highly unequal demand and capacity across the 9 NBI member countries: NBI member
   countries are at different levels of water resources development and have greatly varying
   analytic capacities. As a result, not all countries took the DSS as their highest priority among
   all NBI projects. The project provided additional support where possible, and worked with
   the national DSS unit host institution in each country to develop a DSS integration plan. The
   project also made sure that each counterpart staff completed a pilot application using the DSS
   to ensure the needed skills were available at the DSS unit host institution.
 Non-participation of two member states in project activities: following differences that arose
   among the riparian states regarding the signing of the Cooperative Framework Agreement,
   Egypt and Sudan suspended participation of their technical staff (counterpart staff, PSC
   members) in activities at regional level. There were two challenges posed to the project. First,
   ensuring that all core team members received same level of skills on the DSS became

    difficult. Second, non-participation of PSC members and counterpart staff meant no formal
    involvement in DSS activities and could potentially affect acceptance of the DSS. The cause
    of the reduced participation from Egypt and Sudan was beyond the project’s control,
    however, the project took some measures that helped alleviate the potential impacts of the
    reduced participation. Regarding skills transfer, first, the project made sure that the national
    DSS specialists from these two countries participated in all regional activities and, upon
    return, worked with their counterparts to transfer skills gained through regional trainings.
    Second, pilot application results (data, models, documents) were sent to all counterpart staff
    including those from these two countries. In addition, the national DSS specialists for these
    two countries were made to team up for conducting national trainings. During those
    challenging times, the project leveraged its contacts and the national DSS units to engage
    (however to a limited extent) with the DSS unit host institutions in Egypt and Sudan. Formal
    assessment of capacity by the WRPM team in the two countries has not been possible but it is
    reliably assumed to be satisfactory. While the impact of this suspension is difficult to predict,
    the project has managed to reduce the potential risk of complete halting of DSS activities in
    these two countries.

Budget and expenditure
The WRPMP was funded in two phases from the Nile basin Trust Fund (NBTF) administered by
the World Bank, with a total contribution of US$24 million. The phases were agreed due to the
lack of available funds within the NBTF at the time of the start of the project in 2005. Once the
NBTF had sufficient funds pledged to cover the full project amount, the World Bank agreed to
phase II with a new grant agreement for an amount of US$11.2 million. Since phase I still had
some funds remaining, after phase I was closed, the remaining funds of US$6 million were ‘re-
flowed’ into WRPMP phase II with a grant amendment. The amended phase II budget was
therefore US$17.2 million; the overall project budget remained the same at US$24 million as
originally envisaged.

Lessons
1.       A strong and dedicated team is essential: the DSS wouldn’t have come out as a world
class analytic framework without the competence and dedication of the team put together by the
project. The team interactions with DSS contractor were highly technical and needed resolution
of complex issues. Often, the team had to conduct some research on current practices worldwide,
consult with advisors, debate amongst itself before any consensus would be reached – all
requiring a high degree of competence and dedication.
2.       Specific to the general or vice versa: at the time of the needs assessment exercise, as
part of stakeholder consultation, the project team went out to NBI countries and asked
stakeholders to list issues of water resources management they would like the DSS to address.
This was like opening a big gate to a flood of issues. The stakeholders came up with a wish list of
all things they would like to solve using the DSS. With nine different lists, it was challenging to
derive common set of issues to be used to scope the DSS. In hind sight, it would have been more

                                                 51
efficient if the discussions around water resources issues focused on a few water resources
planning problems, taking for example the investment projects under the two SAPs. This would
have made the discussion with the stakeholders much more concrete and efficient. This approach
was followed in the preparation of the data sharing procedures.
3.       Importance of effective communication: the DSS development stakeholders across
nine countries, the contractor’s team, and international advisors across the globe. Keeping all
parties up to date in all issues that matter for them was key to maintaining team spirit. This was
not often possible but had to be adjusted from time to time. Face to face communication with the
DSS contractor was very important as email and teleconference were not adequate to resolve
complex issues.
4.       Adequacy of Resources: the DSS component was adequately resourced. This has helped
greatly in mobilizing the needed technical expertise in very specialized areas, such as software
testing, software architecture design, etc.
5.       Support of the World Bank team: the support from World Bank Nile Team was crucial
in the early stages of DSS development. Due to slow start-up process, the patience and
encouragement of the World Bank team helped keep the morale of project team high and kept the
momentum.
6.       Sufficient and targeted capacity building: It was very critical to attach the process of
DSS development with continual training for the key professionals (expected DSS users) from the
basin to ensure the sustainable use of the DSS beyond the project period. The training was
focused mainly on the core team and regional and national network members. The selection of the
training participants must be based on the relevance, qualification, readiness to learn. Criteria
were prepared by the project and sent to the countries to be considered for the selection of
training participants. This improved the targeting of participants.
7.       International/other basins' experience: For such a complex project and development of
such a complex tool, it is very important to understand the relevant international experience. The
project organized a few field visits to transboundary basins to learn from their success and failure.
The information and knowledge gained during these field visits was very important and had
positive effects on the design of the NB-DSS.
8.       Involvement of Policy/decision makers: Ensuring the NBI countries clearly understood
the relevance and value of the NB-DSS in its role to support to address regional and national
water resources planning issues - and accordingly to devote the necessary resources to sustain its
use - involvement of policy/decision makers was critical. The project adopted various approaches
to keep stakeholders involved and to raise awareness of PSC members. The consultations
conducted at national and regional levels throughout the process helped in building common
understanding on the scope and uses of the DSS. The national and regional awareness workshops
were excellent in building a common understanding and buy-in from stakeholders.
9.       Integration of national DSS units from the start: The project structure of a PMU at
national level kept the project separate from the host institution. This was not the most effective
arrangement to ensure sustainability. It may have been better to integrate the national DSS unit
into the host institution at the start, ensuring committed full time staff as well as a regular budget.
10.      Effective contract management: The project required a number of substantial (>
US$1million) contracts for DSS development. To ensure value for money, close attention was
required to ensure the contract requirements were fulfilled. The DSS development contract
(Work Package 1) involved complex tasks of requirements analysis, design, development testing.
Inherent in software development processes, all the details about the software design and process
could not be foreseen, therefore continuous monitoring and communication with the DSS
development consultant was crucial. The project, in agreement with DSS development consultant,
ran regular software development sessions to address key DSS design related matters. These
sessions were very effective in resolving pending technical issues.
