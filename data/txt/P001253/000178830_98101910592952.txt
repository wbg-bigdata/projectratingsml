KENYA
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Summary and Conclusions
i.        During the decade since Independence in 1963, Kenya was successful
in expanding its important agricultural sector by an average real growth
rate of over 4% annually. While a significant part of this growth was
attributable to private large scale farming, substantial progress was also
achieved by smallholders. The latter, however, mainly focussed on export cash
crops such as tea, coffee and pyrethrum, which are grown in the better agricul-
tural areas and which could be relatively easily promoted by single crop
statutory boards. More recently, Kenya has recognized the need to give higher
priority to the needs of less privileged small farmers in other areas, which
have so far been largely excluded from the development process. Kenya thus
now aims to both widen the social impact of development and the production
base to strengthen the economy now suffering from a number of adverse inter-
national economic factors.
ii.       To meet these objectives, the Kenya Government has prepared a
new program of which this Project would constitute a first phase. Important
features of the Integrated Agricultural Development Program would be the
increased emphasis to be placed on decentralized planning and project
implementation and its aim to progressively develop comprehensive farm systems
rather than the promotion of a single crop or farming activity. In both
respects this Project would represent a significant change in the approach to
smallholder agriculture.
iii.      Government direct services to agriculture are delivered through
the Ministries of Agriculture, Cooperative Development, Natural Resources
and Works, as well as through more than 15 statutory corporations and boards.
Apart from the installation and maintenance of roads, water supplies, and
other agricultural infra-structure, these services include the provision
and regulation of research, extension and staff and farmer training, input
and output marketing, credit, price controls for inputs and outputs, and
regulation of land title.
iv.       Actual locations 1/ and detailed coverage of each Project would be
determined by detailed Work Plans to be prepared at least once a year and
agreed between Government and the Bank. Nevertheless, the design of each
phase would proceed by pre-selecting not only the provinces to be involved,
but also the districts to be reached within those provinces, with some pre-
liminary indication of locations likely to be included within those districts.
1/   The smallest adminstrative unit of the Kenya Government is the sub-
location, several of which make up a location.



- ii -
v.        Based on the criteria of past exclusion from projects, potential for
development, and availability of necessary infrastructure and institutions, 80
locations scattered through 14 districts in the Central, Eastern, Nyanza and
Western Provinces have been identified for this Project, subject to approval
through Work Plans. They contain about 283,000 holdings measuring some 1.9
million ha and cultivated by about 375,000 families, of which approximatelv
20% are expected to participate in this Project. Although the Project area
covers a wide variety of soil and rainfall regimes, most of the preselected
locations fall into either of two broad ecological zones, viz., a high rainy
zone, where coffee is the predominant cash crop, and a low (1300 m or less)
zone with generally less rainfalL where cotton is the main traditional cash
crop. Typical farm sizes are 2.5 ha in the high zone and about 3.4 ha in the
low zone. Farmers in the high zone grow, maize, beans, potatoes, and passion
fruit, in addition to coffee, while low zone farmers grow maize, beans, sun-
flower and groundnuts in addition to cotton. Most farmers who can afford to
buy and keep a dairy cow do so.
vi.       The Project would, over 5 years, benefit 70,000 farmers culti-
vating 56,000 holdings, and about equally divided both between high and low
zones and between East and West of the Rift Valley. The Project would pro-
vide a Program Unit, staff and support services for extension, input supply,
storage, marketing, animal health and husbandry and credit institutions,
as well as physical farm inputs and hired labour (both on credit), and Project
monitoring and evaluation, staff training, technical advice and studies. Not
later than December 1, 1976, and at least not later than each subsequent
September 1, Government would submit to the Bank a Work Plan, the form and
content of which are described in the Schedule to this report and were agreed
at negotiations. Except in respect of the first year's expenditures, approval
of a Work Plan by the Bank would be a condition of disbursement against
Project expenditure undertaken in an area or for a period to which the Work
Plan relates.
vii.      The Project would cost KSh 288 million (US$35.7 million) of which
34% represents foreign exchange requirements. This cost includes a 10%
physical contingency on fixed assets and a price contingency of 21% on total
base costs but excludes all duties and taxes except taxes on personal income
and fuel which are not significant. The Project would be financed by an
IDA credit of US$10 million and a Bank loan of US$10 million (which, together,
would finance foreign exchange costs plus 33% of local costs), a loan of US$5
from the Arab Bank for African Development (BADEA), a Kenya Government contri-
bution of US$6 million, and a farmers' contribution (in hired labour costs)
of US$4.7 million.
viii.     Orders exceeding US$100,000 for fertilizers (US$3.3 million), vehi-
cles, machinery and equipment (US$1 million) would be procured by interna-
tional competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. Orders
would be bulked whenever possible.- Civil works are scattered and too small
(average cost is US$8,000) to attract international bidding. Civil works
and local building materials (US$3.5 million), as well as items costing not
more than US$100,000, would therefore be procured on the basis of competi-
tive bidding advertised locally. Miscellaneous items estimated to cost



-iii -
less than US$25,000 equivalent would be purchased following appropriate
competitive procedures. There are sufficient domestic suppliers to ensure
adequate competition.
ix.       The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) would have overall responsibility
for implementing the Project. However, aspects of the Project involving
the Cooperative Bank, the Kenya National Federation of Cooperatives (KNFC)
and Cooperative Unions and Societies would be carried out by the Ministry
of Cooperative Development. To ensure coordination of Project activities
at the highest level, an Interministerial Coordinating Committee would be
established under the chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary of MOA, and
with representatives from all major Project institutions. Farm inputs would
be procured and supplied to farmers by KNFC or private stockists. Credit
funds for farm inputs would be channelled mainly through the Cooperative
Bank (about 75%) but also through the Agricultural Finance Corporation
(AFC). Project output, to be delivered by farmers to their cooperatives
in the first instance, would be marketed by the established national market-
ing boards, e.g., Maize and Produce Board for all food crops, the Cotton Lint
and Seed Marketing Board for cotton, Kenya Cooperative Creameries for milk,
and Kenya Meat Commission for meat.
x.        The Project would result in incremental production of 81,000 tons
of maize, 6,000 tons of beans, 36,000 tons of potatoes, 56,000 tons of pas-
sion fruit, 2,000 tons of cotton, 6,000 tons of groundnuts, 7,000 tons of
beef and 34 million litres of milk. Sufficient demand is anticipated for
all this output. The income of a typical high zone farmer is expected to
increase from KSh 1200 to KSh 1900, and that of a low zone farmer from KSh 760
to KSh 1100 because of the Project.
xi.       The internal economic rate of return (IER) of the Project would
be 37% over a 20-year period. A 10% reduction of incremental output would
reduce the IER to 18%. With the Kenya poverty income level in 1975 esti-
mated at US$78 per capita, and with Project farmers earning the equivalent of
US$15 to US$24 per capita without the Project, the target beneficiaries are
well below the poverty level, and would have their income raised by 40% to 55%
as a result of their participation in the Project. The Project would be the
first major effort in Kenya by the Bank to benefit subsistence farmers and
strengthen institutions catering for producers of food crops. It would help
Kenya's balance of payments by reducing food imports, and if successful, could
be repeated for the benefit of subsistence farmers in other parts of the
country.
xii.      Subject to the necessary assurances, the Project would be suitable
for an IDA credit of US$10 million and a "Third Window" Bank loan of US$10
million.






KENYA
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.01      During the decade since Independence in 1963, Kenya was successful
in expanding  its important agricultural sector by an average real growth rate
of over 4% annually. While a significant part of this growth was attributable
to private large scale farming, substantial progress was also achieved by
smallholders. The latter, however, mainly focussed on export cash crops
such as tea, coffee and pyrethrum, which are grown in the better agrictultural
areas and which could be relatively easily promoted by single crop statutory
boards. More recently, Kenya has recognized the need to give higher priority
to the needs of less privileged small farmers in other areas, which have so
far been largely excluded from the development process. Kenya thus now aims
to both widen the social impact of development and the Droduction base to
strengthen the econom.y now suffering from a number of adverse international
economic factors.
1.02      To meet these objectives, the Kenya Government has prepared a new
program of which this Project would constitute a first phase. Important
features of the Integrated Agricultural Development Program would be the
increased emphasis to be placed on decentralized planning and project im-
plementation and its aim to progressivelv develop total farm systems rather
than the promotion of a single crop or farming activity. In both respects
this Project would represent a significant change in the approach to small-
holder agriculture.
1.03      Since 1960, the Bank has extended eleven loans and credits total-
ling some US$71 million to assist Kenya's agriculture in four main areas of
activity: settlement and farm credit (,hree projects), livestock development
(two projects), afforestation for pulp and saw wood production (two projects)
and three projects in support of the development of smallholder tea ind tea
factories. Early in 1975 a loan and credit each for US$7.5 million was
extended to assist the rehabilitation of group farms. In general, projects
have been well executed although there have been substantial delays affecting
the livestock projects. A Bank agricultural sector survey identified this and
other projects.
1.04      The Project was prepared bv P'overnment with assistance fron the
Regional Mission in East Africa (RMEA). This report is based on trie findings
of an IDA mission which visited Kenya in June-July 1975 consisting of Mr. U.
Mbanefo, Mr. K. Challa and Mrs. UI. Lele (IDA) and Mr. H. Manning (Corsultant).
A further mission in September 1975 consisting of Mr. U. tlbanefo (IDA) and
Messrs. C. Spencer and B. Wickstrom (Consultants) reviewed the situation
and needs of the cotton industrv.



IT.  BACKGROUND
A. General
2.01      Lying astride the equator on the eastern coast of Africa, Kenva
has a total area of 583,000 km  with wide variations in climatic an:! ecoL-
gical conditions. More than half of the total area is semi-desert, biut r:e
remaining land, varying in conditions from tropical to temperate, in-'udes
some of the most fertile soils in the Continent.  The climate, modifi' bv
altitude ranging from sea level to over 5,000 meters, is primarily diFferen-
tiated in terms of rainfall regimes which vary from less than 250 mm per year
in the Northern deserts to 1,900 mm per year in the Western Highlands uv,-r
Lake Victoria.  Annual mean maximum temperature exceeds 26 0C over 7) per:ent
of the country, while the corresponding mean minimum temperature i. ah:-t 14 C.
2.02      Kenya's population is estimated at 12.9 million (mid 197t) ar-
is growing at the rate of about 3.3% annually. About 90%0 of the popul3t o,
lives in rural areas and is dependent on agriculture for its livelihood. The
average annual per capita income of those living in rural areas is probatly
around KSh 322 (US$40), well below the countrywide average of KSh 1,57"1
(US$195).
B. The Agricultural Sector
2.03      During the period 1964-73, Kenya's GDP at market prices was esti-
mated to have had a real growth rate of 6.3% annually. In the same period
the monetary sector in agriculture, accounting for less than half the value
added in agriculture, has been growing at 4.9% annually, and the non-monetary
sector at 3.8%, giving a combined growth rate of 4.3% a year.  This growth
rate was less than in other sectors (e.g., industry and mining at 8.5") and
as a consequence the percentage contribution of agriculture to GDP nas been
declining from around 40% in the mid-sixties to about 30% today. Nonetheless
agriculture accounts for over 60% cf total exports of which coffee and tea
are the most important. Other agricultural exports include pyrethrum (701  of
world production), sisal, wattle extract, cotton, nuts, fruits, vegetabLes,
meat, wool, dairy products and animal feeds.
2.04      If one defines large farms as 20 ha and above, there are about 1.2
million smallholdings in Kenya, of which about 50% are less than 2 ha, and
occupy less than 4% of the total cultivable land. Most smallholdings are
farmed by their owners, many of them women, and include squatters on (>vern-
ment land or estates, residents of "group owned" latge farms, and "acceptees"
who farm the land of neighboring tribes to which they do not belonig. About
20% are progressive commercial farmers, another 20% are in a transitional
stage between subsistence and commercial production and the balance of some
60% are subsistence farmers.  The most pr,sperous smallholders' income is
probably several times that of the subsistenre farmer, many of whom extract
a meager and precarious livelihood under uinfavorable agricultural conditions.



-3-
2.05      In addition to maize which is the staple in most of the country,
and sorghum and finger millet widely consumed in the low-lying areas, small-
holders also produce beans, coffee, tea, pyrethrum, cotton, oilseeds, live-
stock, milk, potatoes and fruits. Many smallholders belong to one or more of
the 1,500 active cooperative societies which not only process and market
coffee, pyrethrum, cotton and dairy produce, but also supply farm inputs,
short-term credit, cattle dipping facilities and tractor services.
C. Services to Smallholder Agriculture
2.06      Government services to agriculture are delivered through four
ministries and 15 statutory production boards. The Ministry of Agriculture
(MOA) has the primary responsibility for agricultural development and farmer
services. The Ministry of Cooperative Development (MCD) supervises coopera-
tive organizations, and provides them with management advice. The Ministry
of Works and the Ministry of Water Development provide and supervise crop
extraction roads and rural water supplies respectively. The statutory boards
involved in agriculture are either general, as the Maize and Produce Board
which trades in most food crops, or crop-specific, e.g. the Kenya Tea Develop-
ment Authority, the Coffee Board and the Pyrethrum Board. Many of these
institutions enjoy monopoly powers and each plays an important role in its
particular field. The initiation and implementation of development projects
have been decentralised through the increased use of the District Development
Committee which discusses and monitors all development projects at the dis-
trict level. The District Commissioner acts as Chairman of the Committee,
whose membership includes local chiefs and farmers' representatives in addi-
tion to the District Agricultural Officer and other Government officials.
2.07      Research and Extension Services.  Agricultural research has in
the past been mainly crop oriented and has not specifically addressed the
needs of smallholders. However, much of this research, notably in the dev-
elopment of new maize varieties, is adaptable to the needs of small farmers,
and some appropriate input packages have been established. Although Kenya has
a large extension service for both crops and livestock, its effectiveness
is impared in three ways: first, many of its staff have inadequate technical
background requiring intensified in-service training; second, much of its
better staff has been over specialized and lack an adequate understanding
of total farm needs; and third, the services suffer from inadequate recur-
rent budgetary support which seriously affects staff mobility and effective-
ness.
2.08      Training of staff and farmers is provided for by a large network
of colleges and training institutions. Senior agricultural staff have usually
been trained to university degree level within the University of Nairobi
or overseas. Intermediate level staff are trained to diploma standard at
the Egerton, Embu and Bukura agricultural colleges while junior staff obtain
their training either at Embu, Bukura, or it Farmer Training Centers. Most
districts have at least one Farmer Trainin- Center (FTC), designed to intro-
duce farmers to modern techniques through short residential courses. The FTC



-4-
intake includes both male and female farmers. It is important to ensure that
women are adequately represented in the intake, since they look after many of
the farms. Because of budgetarv constraints a large number of FTCs have
been closed for long periods each year which has considerably reduced their
effectiveness.  MOA in 1972, initiated a training scheme designed to update
the training of all extension officers, particularly in the technological
aspects of crop and animal production. In the same year the Ministry created
the Land and Farm Management Division which has given special emphasis to
specialist staff improving farm management standards.
2.09      Supply of fertilizers, pesticides, and seeds has been undertaken
in the past mainly by private firms and organizations, the largest single
distributor being the Kenya Farmers Association (KFA) through a national
network of branches and stockists. Government is now the sole importer of
all fertilizers and while practically all artificial fertilizers have to be
imported, the Kenya Seed Company (KSC), a commercial organization, undertakes
the multiplication of maize, sunflower and pasture seed. MOA seed inspection
service certifies that seed offered for sale meets legally prescribed purity
and germination standards. Planting materials for tea, coffee, and pyrethrum
are supplied by the respective development agencies through nurseries located
in main production areas. Cotton seed is supplied by the Cotton Lint and
Seed Marketing Board through the ginnery network.
2.10      Credit.  Institutions providing agriculture credit reflect the
historical pattern of development in the sector with the needs of large
farms and estates being provided by commercial banks, the larger commercial
small farmers by the well-established Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC)
and with other smallholder credit being limited to the promotion of specific
crops through the cash crop agencies such as the Kenya Tea Development Autho-
rity the Pyrethrum Marketing Board, the Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Board
and the Horticultural Crops Development Authority. Outside these crop autho-
rities there has in the past been little institutional smallholder credit and
farmers have either borrowed from local traders or through other informal
credit transactions at the village level. In recent years, however, Kenya
has given active encouragement to the development of the cooperative movement
and an increasing volume of credit is now channelled from the Cooperative
Bank, established in 1968, to unions, primary societies and the Kenya National
Federation of Cooperatives, in particular for the development of coffee.
Interest rates to farmers which are subject to Government approval, can range
between 9 and 12%, although, in practice short-term interest has been kept
down to 10% or 11%.
2.11      Marketing of smallholder produce has traditionally been undertaken
by traders, stockists and cooperatives. Some specific crops (mainly for
export) e.g., coffee, tea, cotton, as well as meat and milk are marketed
through statutory monopolies. The Maize and Produce Board (MPB) which ope-
rates through a network of agents, primarily markets maize, but also buys
many other crops (especially pulses and oilseeds) either as an agent for
processors or for direct export.



2.12      Prices of a wide range oF agricultural produce are fixed by Govern-
ment under the Price Control Act of 1971. Thus, prices are set by Government
and implemented by parastatal organizations at producer, processor, and
retail levels for maize, wheat, rice, sugar, milk, cattle, cotton (except
retail) and wattle bark. Government is in the process of establishing a
regular price review mechanism in MOA.
2.13      Individual (transferable) freehold title to land applies in most
parts of Kenya. Government is committed to a program of land adjudication
and registration designed to provide farmers, wnerever possible, with
transferable title to their land. This process has either been completed
or is underway in each district in the Project Area.
111. THE INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM
A. Program Concept, Objectives and Strategy
3.01      In its endeavour to both broaden its agricultural production base
and bring about a more equitable distribution of development to the rural
areas, the Kenya Government is introducing its Integrated Agricultural
Development Program which it intends should provide the future major thrust
of its assistance to small farmers throughout the country. Compared with
past efforts in this sector, the Program would have two important innova-
tive features.
(i) It would seek to promote a "whole farm" 1/ approach to
development in contrast to the single crop aproach which
has characterized past efforts. While this has come to
be accepted as the central objective in its own right,
its adoption is made necessary by the absence of any
predominant crop or farming activity in many areas which
have hitherto been left out of the development process.
Indeed past neglect in many areas has, to a considerable
extent, stemmed from the lack of a single development
opportunity, and the lack of mechanisms to handle the
multi-activity approach;
(ii)  It would encourage the development of project planning and
implementation responsibilities at the local (administrative
District) level. Although tentative steps have been taken
1/   Refers to an approach which addresses all the productive activities
on the farm rather than just one crop or one activity.



- 6 -
in this direction in the past (notably under the earlier
Special Rural Development Program 1/) effective local plan-
ning involvement has only recently begun to emerge.
The Program would thus seek to improve small farm management in the broadest
sense through a strategy of phased cevelopment based on criteria which take
into account not only potential for increasing crop and livestock yields
but also the extent to which areas have hitherto been left out of past de-
velopment efforts.
3.02      The consequences of the orientation changes - from the 'vertical'
to the 'horizontal' development approach are two-fold. First, although
the potential effects in the long-term are likely to be far reaching, the
approach must essentially be evolutionary. In the short term, the Program
cannot fully address all the constraints and needs arising out of the diversity
of activities envisaged. In particular technical innovations and packages
have not yet been fully developed for all crops which may be promoted and the
composition of the district development committees (responsible for local
planning and implementation) and their relationship with the provincial author-
ities, the Central Program Unit and specialistiGovernment departments will
need to evolve in the light of experience. Furthermore with the exception of
the Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Board, which would play a key role in view
of cotton's importance as an anchor crop, the Program cannot fully address
initially some of the weaknesses in organizations such as the Kenya Cooperative
Creameries (KCC) or the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC) which would be involved
in the Program to a less significant degree than the CLSMB. Furthermore, the
need for a Program of this kind is too urgent to await complete resolution of
the slightly overlapping roles of the Cooperative Bank and AFC in supplying
credit to smallholders (a problem which the Kenya Government is currently
discussing with the Bank). However the orientation of the Program is in
itself seen as a means of bringing about such needed improvements over time.
3.03      Second, the Program's implementation would need to be especially
flexible so as to respond to previous experience and reflect this in annual
work plans. The phasing and the pattern of farming activities are therefore
expected to vary in some respects from the models used in planning the Project.
3.04      Initially at least, the Program would not provide for investments
in rural roads, potable water and other economic and social infrastructure
for two reasons. First, there are considerable areas where adequate infra-
structure already exists to support effective production activities including
areas which hitherto have been agriculturally neglected. Second, investments
1/   The SRDP started in 1971 attempted to address a variety of rural needs
e.g. agricultural research, maize production, livestock marketing in six
administrative divisions. For further details see Uma Lele, The Design
of Rural Development.



in other sectors (rural roads, water and education) either already are, or are
soon expected to be supported by other Bank project assistance,and are designed
in a flexible way which will permit close linkages with the further stages
of the Program, and the required coordination would be facilitated by its
encouragement of local planning capabilities.  Overall it is the Program's aim
to achieve a balanced growth between production and infrastructure support to
assure an acceptable economic return to the country and at a cost to the
Government which can be sustained over the long-term.
B. Program Planning and Implementation
3.05      The lowest administrative unit is the sub-location, several of
which form a location; locations make up a division, several of which form
a district; several districts form a province. There are seven provinces
in Kenya, all of which would be ultimately brought within the Program through
a phased development. The Program would be administered along the same
geographical pattern as other Government services. Thus the district would be
the basic level at which most Program activities would be planned and executed
after approval at the national level. Overall executive responsibility
for Program implementation at the district level would be vested in the
District Agricultural Officer (DAO), as is the case with most agricultural
development efforts in Kenya. However, inter-ministerial and inter-institu-
tional coordination of Program plans and activities would be undertaken by the
District Coordinators. District work plans would be approved by a Committee
consisting of the DAO as chairman, the District Cooperative Officer, the
District Program Coordinator as secretary, the relevant cooperative union
manager, the District Development Officer and the AFC Branch Manager. Further
details of administrative and management arrangements are in Chapter V.
C. The Project Area (Map and Annex I)
3.06      The approval of a location to participate in Project activities
would be governed by the principles and criteria described in Chapter IV and
the Schedule to this report. Based on criteria such as the extent of past
exclusion from projects, potential for development, availability of the nec-
essary infrastructure and availability of institutions capable of making an
early contribution to development, a preliminary identification of 80 loca-
tions scattered through 14 districts in Eastern, Central, Nyanza and Western
Provinces has been made. Inclusion of a location in the preselected 80 does
not guarantee that location's participation in the Project, nor does exclu-
sion from the 80 necessarily preclude any location in the Project districts
from being proposed in Work Plans. The preselected locations contain some
283,000 smallholdings cultivated by about 375,000 families (in some instances
2 or more family units cultivate one holding), of which only 56,000 holdings
cultivated by about 70,000 families (20%) are expected to be reached bv the
Prcject. Other families and holdings in the 80 locations, and the other



- 8-
locations in the 4 provinces would come within the scope of subsequent proj-
ects. The following table illustrates the broad Project objective:

283,000   1,878,000   375,000    56,000    372,000    70,000
The 372,000 ha Project area would at full development consist of 81,000 ha
uinder crops, 84,000 ha under pasture, and the rest firewood areas, rocky out-
crops and homesteads.
3.07      The Project area includes a wide variety of soil and rainfall
regimes but, for all practical purposes, the pre selected locations fall
into either of two broad ecological zones, viz a high zone where coffee
is the main cash crop, with maize and beans as the main food crops, and a
low zone where cotton is now the predominant cash crop, but which is also
suitable for cultivation of sunflower, groundnuts, maize, sorghum, millet
beans and peas. Both zones are found in each of the four provinces which
would be involved in the Project; sometimes, as in Machakos, they are found in
the same district. Nevertheless, their features, and the development problems
they present are quite different. The high zone has higher rainfall, denser
population and smaller holdings. Furthermore its farmers have upgraded their
cattle to a greater extent (80% of total grade cattle in Project) have bene-
fitted more from highland farm technology, and have more advanced farm insti-
tutions e.g. the coffee cooperatives.
3.08      The low zone (1300 m or less) has less reliable precipitation during
each of the two rainy seasons. The need to produce a given quantity of food
in essentially less favorable conditions than in the highlands calls for
larger size farms, as well as the spreading of the crop risk through sequential
planting of each of the crops, and the avoidance by and large of perennial
crops. Most of the country's rain-fed cotton is grown in these areas. They
also account for 80% of the Zebu type cattle in the Project area, although
here, too, smallholders have been trying to upgrade their cattle stock in
recent vears through cross-breeding using artificial insemination.

IV. THE PROJECT
A. General Description
4.01      The Project, which would constitute part of a new long-term program
for the development of smallholder agriculture, would, over 5 years, promote
the establishment of "whole farm" systems through the provision of inputs
and the strengthening of extension services and institutions to meet the
needs and support required for a wide range of crop and livestock activities
within 14 districts of four of Kenya's provinces. While a precise definition
of its scope and activities would be the subject of Work Plans to be agreed,
at least annually, the Project is expected to encourage the production of
maize, beans, cotton, potatoes, passion fruit, oil seeds, meat and milk
by about 70,000 small farmers operating some 56,000 holdings.  Specifically
the Project would provide for:
(a) the establishment of a Program Unit,
(b) staff and support services for extension,
(c) cooperative staffing for input supply,
(d) staff and storage facilities for marketing,
(e) staff and support for credit institutions,
(f) physical input requirements,
(g) on-farm hired labor,
(h) staff and facilities for livestock production and health,
(i) Project evaluation,
(j)  staff training, tecinical advice and studies.
The basic planning and management unit would be the administrative district
and the Project would be under the overall direction of the new unit in
MOA.
B. Project Phasing and Physical Development
4.02      Not later than December 1, 1976, and not later than September 1 in
each subsequent year during the Project period, Government would submit to the
Bank a Work Plan. The submission of Work Plans and the criteria and guide-
lines on which they would be based as set out in the attached Schedule were
agreed during negotiations, and approval of a Work Plan by the Bank would be a



- 10 -
condition of disbursement against Project expenditure undertaken during the
period to which it relates, except for .he first year s (1976/77) Project
expenditure estimated at US$0.6 million which would be disbursable without a
Work Plan but would be included seperately, with the 1977/78 costs, in the
first Work Plan to be submitted to the Bank by December 1, 1976. The date
fixed for the submission of the Work Plans assumes a crop and fiscal year from
April 1 through March 31. However, the short rains (October to December) are
important for some crops in certain areas, especially in Western and Nyanza
Provinces. Government may therefore submit a subsidiary Work Plan in March
for Project inputs and planting the following October, in respect of those
areas and crops which would benefit from Project activities during the short
rains.
4.03      Project development is expected to be phased as follows:
1976/77  1977/78  1978/79  1979/80  1980/81   Total
Number of small-
holdings               --       12,400   14,000   14,000   15,600  1/  56,000
Area developed
(ha)                   --       32,800   41,200   41,200   49,800        165,000
Number of farmers
reached                --       15,500   17,500   17,500   19,500  1/  70,000
1/   The number of farmers exceeds the number of holdings because some
holdings are cultivated by more. than one family unit. The average
is 1.25 families per holding.
The above projected phasing is an indicative guideline for planning purposes,
as actual participation would depend on the aggregate Work Plans agreed
between Government and the Bank. Together with pre-Project preparatory work,
the first year (1976/77) would be spent in appointing new staff, the prepara-
tion and approval of the annual Work Plan, selecting the first participating
farmers, and ordering inputs. The first Project planting season would be
March/April 1977.
4.04      The Project aims to reach the same number of farmers in the dis-
tricts East of the Rift Valley as wculd be reached West of Rift. Project
farmers would be about equally divided between farmers living in the high
zone cultivating maize, beans, potatoes, passion fruit and livestock and
those living in the low zone and who, in addition to maize, beans and live-
stock, would cultivate groundnuts and cotton which are suited to the hotter
and drier zone (para. 3.07). Although some crops not listed above (e.g.
sunflower) could be included in a Work Plan, and although such Plans would
govern the actual rate of crop and livestock development, annual expansion
of Project activities is expected tc proceed as follows:

C.  Detailed Features
Program Unit (Annex 2)
4.05      The Project would provide for vehicles, supporting services and
staffing for a new Program Unit in the Land and Farm Management Division of
the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA). The unit would be staffed in Nairobi
by a Head of Program, a Deputy Head of Program, a Financial Controller,
an Evaluation Officer (para. 4.13), a Farm Management Officer, and one Project
Liaison Officer in each of the five main divisions of MOA. Field Staff
of the Program Unit would consist of 4 provincial and 14 district Project
Coordinators to provide coordination at the field level of Project activities
of the MOA, MCD, AFC, MPB and other Project institutions. Government has
identified an experienced civil servant as a possible Head of Program; and
assurances were obtained at negotiations that his appointment, together with
those of the Financial Controller and Evaluation Officer would be made, after
consultation with the Bank, not later than August 1, 1976. Provincial and
District Coordinators would be appointed not later than June 1 preceding the
initial participation of their areas in Project activities, except in the
first year, when the relevant date would be September 1 (i.e. September 1,
1976, for 1977/78 participation).
Extension and Training (Annex 3)
4.06      The Project would provide  for incremental vehicles, housing and
support facilities required for the extension services. Provision is also
made for the capital costs of setting up and equipping demonstration farms
in Farmer Training Centers (FTCs) and for the incremental costs of reorient-
ation courses in these centers for extension staff and new Project farmers.
To ensure adequate representation of women in FTC intake (para. 2.08),
assurances were obtained during negotiations that Government would use its
best efforts to involve more women both in the training and extension services.



12 -
One of the problems encountered in increasing the effectiveness of extension
staff has been the failure to provide enough incentives to agricultural and
veterinary staff. In a civil service structure which provides uniform terms
of employment to staff at the same grade across sectoral boundaries, it is
difficult to provide for special treatment of employees in one sector. None-
theless, the Bank discussed with Government at negotiations circumstances
under which better incentives could be offered, and Government undertook
to forward to the Bank, not later than June 30, 1977, criteria for evaluating
performance of extension staff and a scheme to provide appropriate incentives.
Input Supply (Annex 4)
4.07      While some private traders would continue to sell inputs in markets
within the Project area, most Project physical farm inputs would be procured
by the Kenya National Federation of Cooperatives (KNFC) which would distri-
bute inputs to cooperative unions and through them to societies and farmers.
The Project would provide KNFC with two 14-ton trucks, a central store in
Nairobi containing a plant for packaging seed and fertilizer in 10 kg bags
for smallscale farmers, two regional stores (1 East and 1 West of Rift),
housing, and 2 personnel vehicles. The Project would also provide for three
incremental senior and ten junior- staff for KNFC as well as a new senior
officer in MOA to coordinate the entire national supply of inputs between
importers and distributors.
Storage and Marketing Facilities (Annex 5)
4.08      The Maize and Produce Board (MPB), the national monopoly buyer
of most food crops surplus to subsistence needs, would be strengthened
through the provision of 10 additional field officers, inspectors and
supporting staff, 3 produce collection trucks, two-4500 ton central crop
stores, a 10-ton per hour crop drier, and operating costs. The Horticultu-
ral Crops Development Authority (HCDA) which markets potatoes would also be
strengthened through the provision of 3 stores. The Project would also pro-
vide materials for construction by MPB of two stores per district. Assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that MPB would appoint all participat-
ing cooperative societies and unions as agents for the purchase of all mem-
bers' food crops. Assurances were also obtained from Government that Project
cooperative societies and unions would be appointed sole buyers of seed cotton
and that each society and union would only buy seed cotton from unregistered
farmers after it has first made reasonable efforts to confirm that such
farmers were not indebted to another society.
Smallholder Credit Institutions (Annex 6)
4.09      The Project would provide for vehicles and office equipment as
well as incremental staff for credit institutions as follows: 1 Head Office
and 4 field officers for the Cooperative Bank, 4 Head Office and 20 field
officers for AFC, 2 Head Office and 14 district officers for the Ministry
of Cooperative Development which supervises all cooperative activities, and,



- 1 3 -
on an annually decreasing cost basis, 4 Cooperative Union Managers and 10
Cooperative Society Managers for the few Project unions and societies which
initially cannot pay for these staff out of their own income. The latter
support would gradually reduce during the Project period as these coopera-
tive institutions become financially self-sufficient.
Physical Farm Inputs (Annex 6)
4.10      The Project would provide for the supplv of credit to farmers on
a revolving fund basis for annual physical inputs as follows:
Maize  Cotton  Groundnuts  Passion  Potatoes  Beans  Livestock  Total

The computation of annual incremental requirements of physical inputs is in
Annex 10, Table 12.
On-Farm Hired Labour-(Annex 6)
4.11      One of the most severe development constraints in many parts of the
Project area is the lack of adequate funds for hiring labour to meet demand
peaks, i.e., during land preparation. Therefore an incremental cost of on-farm
hired labour of about KSh 74 million (US$9 million) has been estimated in the
Project (Annex 10, Table 12), and it is proposed to offer farmers credit for up
to 75% of their on-farm requirements including hired labor.  25% of the approved
credit would be provided in cash and the rest in kind.
Livestock Production and Health (Annex 8)
4.12      The Animal Production Division and the Veterinary Department of MOA
are responsible for Government efforts in livestock production and animal
health respectively. The Project would provide for an artificial insemination
(AT) laboratory and office, crushers, veterinary offices and stores, cattle
dips, milk handling and cooling buildings, housing vehicles and equipment, as
well as salaries of 10 livestock field officers and junior field staff, and
incremental vehicle operating costs of the Veterinary and Animal Production
Departments in the Project area. At present, dip management standards vary
from area to area, and artificial insemination has been introduced in some



- 14 -
areas without adequate health measures. Accordingly, the Work Plan would
provide for management of communal cattle dips by the Veterinary Department
and provision of dips, acaricide and hand pumps as a precondition for expan-
sion of the artificial insemination scheme in the Project area.
Project Monitoring and Evaluation (Annex 9)
4.13      For the purpose of monitoring and assessing detailed progress, the
Project would provide for the employment of an Evaluation Officer and 15
enumerators, as well as vehicles, equipment and support services. The Project
Evaluation Officer and enumerators would be part of the Program Unit in the
Land and Farm Management Division of MOA. A statistical survey expert to
be hired by August 1, 1976, would establish the initial methodology for data
collection and analysis. Two different types of evaluation (micro and macro-
evaluation) would be undertaken respectively in two divisions of MOA. Firstly,
there would be a detailed monitoring and micro-evaluation of Project progress
to be undertaken by the Evaluation Officer and his staff, and reported in each
Project Quarterly Report. The monitoring indeces here would consist of the
number of participating farm holdings, farm sizes, cropping patterns, crop and
livestock yields and output, number of participating farmers and farmers'
incomes. Secondly, there would be a continuing macro-evaluation, the findings
of which would be included in the third and subsequent Work Plans. 1/ In this
way a close connection would be established between evaluation and planning
throughout the life of the Project. This macro-evaluation would be undertaken
either by the Evaluation Section in the Economic Planning Division (EPD) of
the MOA, which is now being expanded, or by the Central Bureau of Statistics
(CBS). EPD/CBS evaluation indices would include the effectiveness of Project
management and institutions, types of Project beneficiaries, employment, income
distribution, aggregate production, foreign exchange costs and benefits,
budgetary implications and other sectoral and macro-economic aspects of the
Project. Assurances were obtained during negotiations that the monitoring and
evaluation programs would be undertaken as indicated.
Training
4.14      Government is currently discussing with external aid donors new
proposals for the training of extension staff. Government has satisfactory
training schemes for most other grades of Project staff, but this needs to be
supplemented by more management oriented training such as is provided by the
Management Training School in Swaziland which would provide appropriate train-
ing for senior Project staff. The Project would therefore provide KSh 2
million (US$250,000) to be spent on Bank approved staff training and fellow-
ship schemes.
1/   The required timing of the second Work Plan would be such that
insufficient evaluation data would be available from the first
Project year activities.

Technical Advice and Studies
4.15      The Project would provide KSh 6 million (US$750,000) for Bank
approved technical advice, studies and consultancies. This provision would
cover ad hoc studies directed at specific Project needs and in addition the
proposal to provide periodic in-depth technical advice from an international
agricultural institution (possibly research oriented) was discussed during
negotiations. It was agreed that Government would include specific proposals
for technical assistance and studies in the Work Plans.
D. Project Cost Estimates (Annex 10)
4.16      Total Project cost is estimated at KSh 288 million (US$35.7 mil-
lion) of which 34% represents foreign exchange requirements. The estimated
costs are summarized below:

Costs have been estimated at prices expected to prevail as of February 1976
and include capital costs plus incremental operating costs directly attribut-
able to Project activities. A physical contingency of 10% has been included
on civil works, motor vehicles, and equipment. A price contingency equal to
21'  of base costs was also included, calculated at the following rates:  civil
works at 14'% in 1976, 12% in 1977 to 1979 and 10% in 1980; motor vehicles and
equipment at 10' in 1976 and 8%ZO thereafter; farm inputs, salaries and other
operating costs 10%' a vear. Except for tax on salaries and fuel which is not
si-nificant, Project costs do not include any taxes or duties.
4.17      Credit totalling KSh 112 million (US$14.0 million) would be provided
under the Project on a revolving and incremental basis (Annex 10, Tables 11,
12 and 13) for fertilizers, insecticides, seed and hired labor. In accordance
with national cooperative credit regulations in force as of March 31, 1976,
the credit would be limited to 75% of the estimated amount of these on-farm
costs, and would be provided in kind, save for 25% of the approved credit
(i.e. KSh 28 million or US$3.5 million) which would be provided in cash. In
order to meet the needs of farmers who cannot provide the level of security cur-
rentlv demanded under existing cooperative and AFC regulations, a Subsistence
Farmers Credit Fund (SFCF) of KSh 4.7 million (US$0.6 million) would be set
aside out of the above-mentioned fund for on-farm credit, to be loaned to
subsistence farmers through cooperative institutions. Further details of
this scheme and other credit terms are discussed in paragraphs 5.05 to 5.07.
E. Financing
4.18      The Project would be financed in the following amounts and
proportions.
USS (million)       % of Total Cost
IDA                           10.0                    28

Total                  35.7                   100
1/   Arab Bank for African Development
The proposed IDA credit would be on standard terms and the Bank loan would
be on "Third Window" terms at 4.85% for 25 years including 7 years of grace.
The credit and loan would finance the foreign exchange costs (US$12.3 million)
plus 33% of local costs, or about 56% of total costs. It is recommended that
retroactive financing of US$0.3 million be approved for from January 1, 1976
to meet the initial staff and other preliminary Project costs. The BADEA



- 17 -
loan would be to Kenya Government for 25 years with 5 years of grace at 4A
interest.  The farmers' contribution represents farmers' cash costs for hired
labor. The revolving funds for credit would be the subject of separate sub-
sidiarv loan agreements between the Government and the Cereals and Sugar Fi-
nance Corporation (CSFC), 1/ between CSFC and the Cooperative Bank of Kenya,
and between CSFC and AFC. The signing of these subsidiary loan agreements,
the terms of which are discussed in paragraph 5.07, and a loan agreement be-
tween Government and BADEA would be a condition of loan/credit effectiveness.
F. Procurement
4.19      Orders exceeding US$100,000 for fertilizers (US$3.3 million),
vehicles, machinery and equipment (US$1 million) would be procured by inter-
national competitive bidding in accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines. Orders
would be bulked whenever possible. Civil works are scattered and too small
(average cost is US$8,000) to attract international bidding. Civil works
and local building materials (US$3.5 million), as well as items costing not
more than US$100,000, would therefore be procured on the basis of competitive
bidding advertised locally. Miscellaneous items estimated to cost less than
US$25,000 ecuivalent would be purchased following appropriate competitive
procedures. There are sufficient domestic suppliers to ensure adequate
competition.
C. Disbursement (Annex 11)
4.20      Disbursements of funds from both the Bank loan and IDA credit
would be on the following basis:
(a) 100% of foreign expenditures or 85% of total expenditures on vehi-
cles, machinery and equipment; fertiLizers; technical assistance
and studies;
(b) 85% of total expenditures on civil works;
(c) 80% of loans disbursed to farmers in Project areas (i.e. apart
from fertilizers); and
(d) 65% of total expenditures on fuel and oil.
All items are detailed and individually costed in ,nnex 10. Di;h;Ursements
against civil works, vehicles, machinery, equipment and fertiLizers would
be fully documented.  Disbursements against loans to farmers would be             ->
against certified expenditures by the Cooperative Bank and AFG and disburse-
ment against all other costs would be made against certificates of expenditure
l/   The Cereals and Sugar Finance Corporation (CSFC) is a small corporation
within the Treasury which is used by Kenya Government :i.-ost exclusively
for the purpose of channelling funds to other institutions (e.g. AFC)
which execute the projects or farm credit components tuiereot.



- 18 -
endorsed by the Head of Program, the documentation for which would not be
submitted for review, but would be retained by Government, and available for
inspection by the Bank during supervision. The estimated schedule of dis-
bursements is in Annex 11. Any funds remaining in the Loan or Credit Account
at the end of the Project may be reallocated with Bank approval.
H. Accounts and Audit
4.21      The Financial Controller in the Program Unit would establish and
maintain adequate books and records to accurately reflect the assets and
liabilities of the Project and the receipts and payments in respect of the
Project, in such a way as to enable identification of such assets, liabili-
ties, receipts and payments pertaining to the Project and not to other
activities of MOA. Similarly, the MCD, MPB, Cooperative Bank, AFC, KNFC,
the Cooperative Unions, and Societies involved in the Project, and HCDA, being
prospective beneficiaries under this Project, would maintain books and records
sufficient to facilitate identification of all assets, liabilities, receipts
and payments pertaining to the Project. Assurances were obtained during nego-
tiations that the accounting records described above would be established and
maintained, and that the accounts of all the organizations and institutions
mentioned above would be audited by independent auditors acceptable to the
Bank.
4.22      Quarterly Reports of the Project activities, achievements, and
problems would be prepared by the Head of Program (para 4.05). Assurances
were obtained at negotiations that the Project Quarterly Reports would
be forwarded to the Bank promptly, and that the annual accounts of the Minis-
tries and institutions referred to above and CLSMB would be audited by inde-
pendent auditors acceptable to the Bank and would be forwarded to the Bank not
later than six months following the year to which they relate. Assurances
were also obtained during negotiations that a suitably qualified internation-
ally recruited Project Financial Controller would be appointed after consulta-
tion with the Bank.
V. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.  Project Direction and Coordination
5.01      The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) would have overall responsibility
for implementing the Project. However, under this overall direction, those
aspects of the Project involving the Cooperative Bank, the Kenya National
Federation of Cooperatives, and Cooperative Unions and Societies would be
carried out by the Ministry of Cooperative Development. To ensure proper
coordination at the highest level, Government and the Bank agreed during nego-
tiations on the establishment of an Interministerial Coordinating Committee



- 19 -
under the chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary of MOA, and with the Director
of Agriculture as a member. The Committee would meet from time to time at the
request of the Head of Program and in any case at least once a quarter to
approve Work Plans, review Project progress, approve the Project-Quarterly
Report (para 4.22) and to resolve problems. The Ministry of Cooperative
Development would be represented on the Committee by its Permanent Secretary
and by the Commissioner of Cooperatives; the Ministry of Finance, the AFC, the
MPB, the Cooperative Bank, the CLSMB, the KNFC and HCDA would each be repre-
sented by the Permanent Secretary or General Manager of the institution. The
interministerial Committee would be established prior to September 30, 1976.
5.02      At field level the district is the basic management unit and,
a committee consisting of the DAO, the District Project Coordinator, the
District Cooperative Officer, the District Development Officer, the Coopera-
tive Union Manager and the AFC Branch Manager, would approve district Work
Plans, review progress, and receive monthly and quarterly Project reports from
the District Project Coordinator. Provincial Commissioners, District Comis-
sioners, Chiefs and Sub-Chiefs would be closely associated with the Project
and would be encouraged to advise Project staff, and to employ their consider-
able local influence in the furtherance of the Project objectives.
B. Detailed Organization (Annex 2 and Chart)
5.03      Within MOA, overall Project direction would be the responsibility
of the new Program Unit consisting of the Head of Program, Deputy Head of
Program, Financial Controller, and Evaluation Officer and their supporting
staff. Extension and training, livestock development, and animal health
services would be provided by the regular services and staff of the re-
spective divisions of MOA. The supply of inputs would be organized by the
Program Unit, with the advice of the extension staff. The normal channel
for most farm inputs on credit would be from KNFC to the cooperative unions,
and from these to cooperative societies for distribution among their members.
However, to a small extent, some farmers may buy inputs from private stockists
for cash, or on credit from AFC. Farmers would store small quantities of
produce for short periods, but the main responsibility for storage of produce
would rest with the cooperative societies and unions, the Maize and Produce
Board (MPB) and the Horticultural Crops Development Authority (HCDA). Market-
ing of produce would be mainly by cooperative societies acting as agents for
MPB, HCDA, the KCC, the Kenya Meat Commission (KMC), the CLSMB and the Coffee
Board (KCB). These statutory institutions are the ultimate sellers and
exporters of farmers' produce. Credit for farm inputs would be channelled
from the Treasury's CSFC through either the Cooperative Bank and unions or to
a lesser extent through AFC. Project monitoring and evaluation would be
shared between the new Evaluation Officer and either the Central Bureau of
Statistics or the Economic Planning Division of MOA (para 4.13). The Ministry
of Cooperative Development (MCD) would continue to exercise its supervision
of the management of the Cooperative Bank, KNFC, Cooperative Unions and
societies involved in the Project. Evidence of continued good management of
these institutions would be required in Work Plans (schedule and para 4.02).



- 20 -
5.04      The Project would thus involve a large number of Kenyan institu-
tions which are already rendering services to farmers. Most of them are
functioning with moderate success, and a substantial part of Project costs
would be incurred in strengthening the key Project institutions with a view to
improving their effectiveness. The KMC, the KCC, and the CLSMB, all national
institutions with responsibility for some Project marketing, suffer at pre-
sent from financial or management problems. As the Project's dependence on
KIC and KCC would be relatively small, and as their situations do not at the
moment threaten loss of Project benefits, no measures are now proposed for
their strengthening but their positions would be kept under review. The
CLSMB, (Annex 7) however has suffered from a series of management and finan-
cial problems dating back several years. Cotton is not only the traditional
cash crop in about half of the area (the low zone), but it is also sold
through a monopoly marketing organization (CLSMB), and would therefore serve
as an 'anchor' crop providing some security for lending institutions.
Efficient management of CLSMB is therefore of considerable importance for
achieving Project objectives. Government agreed with the Bank during negotia-
tions on certain proposals for strengthening CLSMB and improving CLSMB's
methods of operation. The filling of Board vacancies and hiring after consul-
tations with the Bank, of suitably qualified persons as Financial Controller,
Marketing Officer and Chief Accountant are conditions of loan/credit effec-
tiveness.
5.05      Traditionally, credit schemes have tended to by-pass some farmers
because of their difficulty in providing adequate security. Yet such farmers
lack the resources to buy modern inputs for cash, and, without credit would
be unable to increase their output sufficiently to provide the necessary
security. In a pilot effort to break this vicious circle KSh 4.7 million
or US$0.6 million sufficient for about 3,500 farmers would be set aside exclu-
sively for such farmers in a Subsistence Farmers Credit Fund (SFCF) to be
administered by the Cooperative Bank through cooperative institutions. The
results of this pilot scheme would be carefully monitored during the Project,
and if successful could be expanded through later projects. Criteria for
selection of participants and procedures which would be similar to those of
the Cooperative Production Credit Scheme and the similar ongoing USAID Project
for Subsistence farmers (detailed in Annex 5), were agreed during negotiations.
5.06      Most of the lending to small scale Kenyan farmers is through co-
operative societies, which also mobilize farmers' savings for smallholder
development. The main national institution is the Cooperative Bank of Kenya
Limited, which lends to Cooperative Unions to finance their members' agri-
cultural and marketing operations. Most of the Project financing for on-farm
inputs would therefore be channeled from the Treasury through its Cereals and
Sugar Finance Corporation (CSFC) the Cooperative Bank and thence to the
Cooperative unions and societies to finance farmers' purchases of inputs. Some
farmers have traditionally been customers of AFC, and credit sufficient for
their on-farm inputs would be channeled from the Treasury through CSFC to
AFC. The estimated credit amounts to be channeled through cooperatives and
AFC would be stated in each Work Plan: present estimates indicate that 75%
(including SFCF) would be channeled through the cooperatives and 25% through
AFC. Both the Cooperative Bank and AFC are currently operating satisfactorily.



- 21 -
5.07      Apart from SFCF financing, Project funds for cooperative farm
credit would be advanced to CSFC at 5% for 20 years (including 5 years of
grace). CSFC would onlend such funds to the Cooperative Bank for 24 months at
5-1/2%. Each annual loan to AFC or the Cooperative Bank (to be made up of the
annual requirements for farmers credit) would be repaybale in full on maturity
in 24 months. The Cooperative Bank would on-lend to unions at 7% annually and
these in turn to societies at 9% (in each case loans would be for 22 months).
The cooperative societies would lend to farmers at 11% for periods not exceed-
ing 18 months. For SFCF (para 5.05) Government would on-lend to CSFC at 3%,
and CSFC to the Cooperative Bank at 3-1/2%, the Cooperative Bank would lend to
unions at 5%, unions to societies at 7% and societies to farmers at 10%.
Lending periods would be the same as for regular cooperative credit operations.
Funds would be channeled from CSFC to AFC for 24 months at an interest rate of
5-1/2% for on-lening to farmers at 11% for up to 18 months. Farmers would
be able to borrow up to 75% of their annual requirements of fertilizer seed
and other on-farm expenses. Only 25% of the approved credit would be advanced
in cash; the rest would be in kind. These and other loan terms and conditions
(detailed in Annex 5) were agreed during negotiations.
Staffing
5.08      The Project would require the following incremental staff:
Senior Staff   Others   Total
IMinistry of Agriculture                         2           646       667

Total                             70          795       865
Detailed lists of incremental staff posts are in Annex 10.  Job descriptions
for the four senior Project positions (Head of Programi, Deputy Head of Program,
Financial Controller and Project Evaluation Officer) are in Annex 2. It
is anticipated that the Head of Program would be a Kenyan, but that staff
for the other three top positions would be recruited internationally. In
that event, Kenyan counterpart staff would be recruited and the necessary
training provided (para 4.14). No difficulty is envisaged in recruiting the
rest of the staff set out above. They consist mainly of 500 dip attendants
(MOA) and other junior employees who are readily available.

VI. PRODUCTION, MARKETING, FARMERS' BENEFITS AND EFFECTS
ON GOVERNDENT BUDGETS
A. Yields and Production
Yields
6.01      Yields are particularly difficult to forecast in this Project be-
cause development in each district will vary according to the District Work
Plan, and because of the wide variety of geographical areas and institutions
encompassed by the Project. Yields would be generally greater for farmers
in the higher (usually rainier) zone than for those in the low zone. Yield
estimates are averages taking into account the likelihood of drought in one
year out of four. Yields would thus be higher than these averages in good
years and lower in bad. For the typical farmer, yields are expected to in-
crease cumulatively until reaching the projected maxima in the fourth harvest
following the farmer's first introduction to Project services. For the typi-
cal high altitude farmer cultivating 2.5 ha, yields are expected to improve
over four years as follows:  maize from 1 ton/ha to 2.7 ton/ha; beans from
0.54 ton/ha to 1.1 ton/ha; potatoes from 5 ton/ha to 18 ton/ha; passion fruit
from 5 ton/ha to 15 ton/ha; milk from 1,100 litres to 1,700 litres per cow,
and beef from 100 to 130 kg/ha. For the lowland farmer typically cultivating
about 3.4 ha yields are expected to increase over four years as follows:
maize from 0.8 ton/ha to 2.3 ton/ha; beans from 0.54 ton/ha to 1.1 ton/ha;
cotton from 0.23 ton/ha to 0.65 ton/ha, groundnuts (in shell) from 0.60 ton/
ha to 1.2 ton/ha; milk from 1,000 litres to 1,600 litres per cow, and beef
from 100 to 130 kg/ha. Smallholders in Kenya have, under similar conditions,
with average levels of husbandry, obtained yields comparable to the above
maxima. The four-year build up period assumed is to enable farmers to become
accustomed to the Project's innovations and improved farming systems.
Production
6.02      On the basis of the above yields, Project activities at full de-
velopment (year 8, 1983/84) would result in the following incremental produc-
tion: 81,000 tons of maize valued (at 1983/84 prices in 1975 constant terms)
at KSh 51 million, 6,000 tons of beans worth KSh 9 million, 36,000 tons of
potatoes worth K.Sh 12 million, 56,000 tons of passion fruit valued at KSh 26
million, 2,000 tons of cotton worth K.Sh 4 million, 6,000 tons of groundnuts
worth KSh 9 million, and 7,000 tons of beef worth KSh 21 million and 34 mil-
lion litres of milk worth KSh 23 million. Inevitable changes in price rela-
tionships are likely to produce changes in the quantities of production
indicated above, and could lead to production of crops not at present
anticipated.



- 23 -
B. Markets and Prices (Annex 13)
Markets
6.03      Sufficient demand is anticipated for all Project output.  With the
exception of some passion fruit juice, higher quality cotton, and some beef,
the bulk of the Project output would be consumed within the country. There
exist well-established marketing channels, which would be further strength-
ened through this Project by provision of more staff, vehicles, equipment
and storage. Most Project farmers are expected to sell their cash and sur-
plus food crops to their Cooperative Society in the first instance, but the
Maize and Produce Board (MPB) would ultimately handle Project farmers' sur-
pluses of maize, beans, and groundnuts, practically all of which would be for
domestic consumption, mainly in the urban areas. The proposed agreement to
permit cooperative societies to purchase maize and other food crops for which
MPB is responsible (para 4.08) would result in a more complete coverage of
farmers, would alleviate local shortages and surpluses and thereby stabilize
prices. Cooperatives would sell processed cotton lint to the Cotton Lint
and Seed Marketing Board (CLSMB) (para 5.04). Cooperatives would also mar-
ket passion fruit (part of which would be processed into drinks at existing
plants) and potatoes (through the Horticultural Crop Development Authority
as well as traditional marketing channels); the milk would be sold to Kenya
Cooperative Creameries, and beef to the Kenya Meat Commission.

6.04      Prices of all Project output are fixed by parastatal organizations
and approved by Government, at both farmgate and consumer levels. Farmgate
prices currently paid for proposed Project crops are generally adequate to
provide enough incentive for farmers to use modern inputs, and farmers are
usually able to sell small amounts above the official prices when the latter
fail to reflect true scarcities. There is, however, an increasing awareness
of two factors in this connection: firstly, absolute prices should not be
fixed in isolation without, at the same time, determining relative prices,
between, for example, beef, maize and cotton which compete for factors of
production and are clearly substitutes in the farmer's planning. Secondly,
much more information is required on a continuing basis than is available
concerning markets, supply and demand factors, and substitutability and com-
plimentarity in both production and consumption, in order to determine appro-
priate commodity prices. Kenya Government has expressed its intention to
undertake a regular review of agricultural commodity prices. Assurances
were, therefore, obtained during negotiations that Government would set up
a unit within MOA to formulate recommendations on absolute and relative
agricultural prices, and would review annually the farmgate prices of meat,
milk, maize, seed cotton, groundnuts, beans, sunflower seed, and passion
fruit, and publish the prices simultaneously-by December 15 each year.

C. Farmers' Benefits (Annex 14)
6.05      The Project would provide intensive extension service and modern
farm inputs on credit to about 70,000 farmers most of whom have not previous-
ly benefitted from such institutional assistance. Farmers' benefits would
vary considerably because of the wide range of conditions included in the
Project areas. The annual income of a typical low zone farmer cultivating
about 3.4 ha is expected to increase from about KSh 760 before the Project
to about KSh 1,100 at his fourth harvest and thereafter. Within the same
period the annual income of a typical high zone farmer cultivating 2.5 ha
would increase from about K.Sh 1,200 to about KSh 1,900. Although the
Project would call for large investments of materials (mainly fertilizer,
seed and insecticide) and readily available labor, those farmers prepared to
undertake such investments would gain worth-while returns.
D. Effects on Government Budget (Annex 15)
6.06      As this Project would benefit lower income rural families it would
result in direct budgetary transfers from higher income taxpayers to rural
small scale farmers who pay only indirect taxes. There are no direct means
whereby the Government can recover from beneficiaries the full cost of the
proposed Project services and investments, and specific charges for Project
services would be contrary to Government policy. Government revenue from
excise and purchase taxes would of course increase as Project farmers would
spend their increased incomes. However, the only direct source of Govern-
ment income from the Project is the margin between the interest payment to
the Bank Group and the interest Government would charge the Cooperative Bank
or AFC. Government would, therefore, ostensibly suffer an annuai deficit of
about K.Sh 20 million (US$2.5 million) as a result of staff, fuel and other
operating costs. Government is aware of the implications of this Project,
and that the recurrent costs would be higher with subsequent phases. Assur-
ances were obtained during negotiations that Government would review on a
regular basis the recurrent budget implications of this and other projects
in the agricultural sector so as to ensure that they can be sustained over
the periods for which they are designed.
VII. ECONOMIC BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION
(Annex 16)
7.01      The primary direct benefits of the Project would be increased
production of maize, beans, potatoes, passion fruit, cotton, groundnuts,
milk and beef.
7.02      The Project's internal economic rate of return (IER) is estimated
to be 37% over a 20-year period. All Project costs, except the cost of



- 25 -
training, research and studies were included in the calculation. The costs
of farm production inputs and value of Project incremental output are based
on recent World Bank projections. The Project would not result in any incre-
mental use of family labour. It would, however, result in a considerably
increased use of hired labour during peak periods (270 man-days a year instead
of 96 man-days a year for the average Project farm). The hiring of labor in
the Project area is an established tradition and sufficient casual labor is
available to meet Project demands. Hired labor has been fully costed at
market rates. Foreign exchange costs and benefits are valued at KSh 9.30 =
US$1.00 to reflect the economic cost of foreign exchange to Kenya; if foreign
exchange were valued at the prevailing exchange rate of KSH 8.05 = US$1.00,
the economic rate of return would be 34%.
7.03      Risks associated with rainfall and other climatic conditions have
been taken into account in estimating Project benefits (Annex 8). One impor-
tant source of risks that could affect the Project's rate of return includes
the possibility that Project institutions might fail to reach the expected
number of farmers with services and inputs. To minimize this risks Project
implementation would be governed by detailed Work Plans (Chapter IV and
Schedule); furthermore, a number of assurances affecting the operations of
Project institutions were obtained during negotiations. Another risk is that
farmers may adopt the recommended input packages less rapidly than anticipated
owing to the relatively high cost of inputs and the associated financial risk
in case of crop failure. However, the promotional efforts of intensified and
strengthened extension services are specifically designed to demonstrate the
benefits to be derived from adoption. Even if incremental output from the
Project were reduced by 10% the rate of return would still be 18%. If Project
benefits were delayed by one year throughout the Project period and Project
costs incurred as anticipated, the rate of return would be 12%.
7.04      Project benefits go beyond quantifiable increases in production.
The Project would represent the first major effort in Kenya to benefit small
farmers producing mainly food crops. It would revitalize the institutions
supplying services to these farmers and focus attention directly on their
problems. Some Project expenditures, notably the US$3.5 miLlion to be spent
on civil works, would benefit subsequent projects. Assuming successful imple-
mentation of this first phase Project, an instrument would have been forged
for reaching small-scale farmers throughout the country. These benefits are
expected to accrue without detriment to the environment.
7.05      With the IBRD calculated poverty level for Kenya at US$78 per capita,
and with prospective beneficiaries currently earning the equivalent of US$15
to US$24, including cash and subsistence, the Project is clearly addressing
the needs of the poorer segments of Kenyan society. The Project would at 1975
constant prices increase beneficiaries' incomes by 40% to 55%. Individual
benefits would be considerably larger for some 5% of the poorest Project
farmers who are currently not eligible to receive credit but would be given
credit under the Project.

VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATIONS
8.01      The Project would be implemented in accordance with a Work Plan
(para 4.02) to be prepared by Kenya Government at least once a year, and
agreed between Government and the Bank; and except for the 1976/77 Project
costs of about US$0.6 million (para. 4.02), such agreement would be a con-
dition of disbursements for the period and area to which the Plans relate.
Details of the Work Plan which were agreed during negotiations, are in the
Schedule'to this report.
8.02      The following would be c.onditions of loan/credit effectivenes:
(a) execution of a loan agreement between Kenya Government
and BADEA;
(b) execution of an onlending agreement between the Govern-
ment and CSFC, and subsidiary loan agreements between
CSFC and AFC and between CSFC and the Cooperative Bank;
and
(c) appointment, after consulting the Bank, of a Financial Controller,
the Chief Accountant, and a Marketing Officer for CLSMB.
8.03      Following are some of the more important assurances obtained
during negotiations:
(a) Government would appoint, not later than August 1, 1976,
and after consultation with the Bank, the Head of Program,
the Program Financial Controller, the Project Evalua-
tion Officer and a statistical survey expert acceptable
to the Bank (paras 4.05 and 4.13);
(b) Government would appoint not later than September 30,
1976, the Interministerial Coordinating Committee
described in para 5.01);
(c) Government would set up a unit in MOA to review and publish
agricultural prices annually (para 6.04);
(d) Government would regularly review the recurrent budget
implications of this and other development projects in its
agricutlural sector to ensure that they can be sustained
over the periods for which they were designed (para 6.06);
and
(e) A micro-evaluation of the Project would be undertaken by
the Project Evaluation Officer and his staff, while a macro-
evaluation would be carried out by staff of either the Central
Bureau of Statistics or the Economic Planning Division of MOA;
and those evaluations would cover the matters stated in para
4.13.



- 27 -
8.04      The proposed project constitutes a suitable basis for an IDA
credit of US$10 million on standard IDA terms and a "Third Window" Bank
loan of US$10 million for 25 years including 7 years of grace.

ANNEX 1

KENYA
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Physical and Demographic Details of Project Areas
General Characteristics
1.        The Project area covers almost the whole range of geographic charac-
teristics existing in Kenya. It encompasses 80 locations in 22 divisions,
involving 14 districts in Central, Eastern, Western and Nyanza Provinces.
Eastern Zone (or East or Rift) comprises Central and Eastern Provinces. The
total area of the Eastern Zone districts included in the Project is 36459 sq.
km.  Nyanza and Western provinces comprise the Western Zone (or West of Rift),
with a total area of 20749 sq. km. Thus the total area encompasing the pro-
ject is 57,208 sq. km, which represents only 10.1 percent of the total land
area of Kenya, although it contains nearly 60 percent of the national popula-
tion (1975 estimates - see Table 2).
2.        Both of these zones are therefore among the most densely populated
rural areas in the country. Table 2 indicates that according to the 1975
estimates Kisii district has the highest population density, followed by
Kakamega, Kiambu and Kisumu. The same estimates show that Kakamega district
has the largest population followed by Machakos, South Nyanza and Kisii.
Project districts, their areas, populations, rainfall, and other physical,
economic and social features are detailed in Tables 1 through 12 of this
Annex.
3.        Topographically the locations preselected for the Project range
in alitude from 2,000 metre (Bungoma District) to 600 metres (Machakos Dis-
trict). Land types range from undulating and hilly with highly fertile, deep
loam soils (Kakamega District) to flat, plains bordering on low fertility
soils (Eastern Embu District). Soil types range from dark red friable clays
(Machakos/Kisii) to light brown sandy loam (Busia/Bungoma). In general, all of
the locations have reasonable annual rainfall (Table 3). Meru receives the
highest annual rainfall (2920 mm) and Nyeri the lowest (860 mm). The annual
temperature range between project locations is determined largely by altitude,
varying between locations within the ranges 45 - 700 F (mean minimum) to
70 - 98 F (mean maximum). A more detailed discussion of the agricultural
characteristics of the proposed project areas is in Annex 8.
Population, Occupation and Social Services
4.        Of the estimated Kenya population of 13.5 million people (1975),
7.9 million or 59 percent Live within Ihe districts which would be
included in the project (32.1 percent western zone, 26.8 percent eastern
zone - see Table 2).  The popl(Lation of the Project areas in common with



ANN EX
Page 2
the whole country, is predominantly agricultural and,of the districts con-
cerned, 5 percent (some 400,000) of the total population are in wage employ-
ment, compared with only 3.5 percent of the population as a whole (Table 4).
It is Government policy to encourage rural employment so that the flow of job
seekers to the urban areas can be reduced. Table 4 shows that casual employ-
ment is higher in the rural areas than regular employment. The majority of
the employees in the rural areas are in the agricultural sector. 1/ Seasonal
fluctuations in labour requirement in agriculture explain why casual employ-
ment is higher than the regular employment in the rural areas. On average,
wages of employed people in these areas are in line with national estimates.
5.        In general the proposed project area enjoys better social services,
e.g. education and medical facilities, compared with other areas. About 70%
of the primary schools, and about 73% of the secondary schools in Kenya are
in these provinces (Table 5). This table also shows that about 74% of
the primary school and 64% of the secondary school enrolments in Kenya in
1973 were in these four provinces. Conversely, Table 6 shows the provision
of public health services in the project districts, where 18,000 hospital beds
in Kenya (46%) are in the four provinces. The ratio of persons per hospital
bed at 988 compares badly with the national average of 686 people.
Project Coverage
6.        On the basis of a detailed survey, involving all divisions of the
Ministry of Agriculture Headquarters and field staff at all levels, the most
suitable locations were identified for participating in the Project. The
main criterion for involving specific locations was lack of extensive benefit
from previous schemes linked with relatively dense population and distinct
potential to benefit from concentrated, coordinated development. The
project would aim to involve 20 percent of all holdings in the locations
covered.
7.        Table 8 details the planned implementation of the Project in the
eastern zone (Eastern and Central provinces). Based on the surveyed data 2/
for total number of holdings size (column f) for each division,2/ to obtain
the total farm area of participants at the end of the fourth project year
(column e). Column (d) shows the surveyed 2/ total geographic area of the
locations concerned. This column deviates from direct proportion to the total
area assumed for participant holdings partly because of small variations in
holding size from the average taken in column (f), but mainly because of varia-
tion in non-farming areas, roads, forest, towns, water, rock etc., between
locations.
8.        The average holding size (column f) represents the total "shamba"
area, including cultivated land, pasture, homestead and some allowance for
domestic firewood areas, but excluding access roads, communal areas, etc.

9.        An asessment has been made (column a) of the total number of
families included in the project area. This estimate is based on the
surveyed data 1/ from the eastern zone (giving a ratio of approximately
1.25 families per holding). This calculation is made in order to provide
an estimate of the number of families and hence, taking the average figure
of 6 members per family (as per census), in order to establish the total
number of people expected to be reached. Table 9 summarises the planned
areas and participants expected in the eastern zone at project completion
(year- 5).
10.       On a similar basis to the east, Table 10 provides the area and
numbers of holdings and people (estimated) to be involved in the Project
in the western zone (Western and Nyanza Provinces). This table is cal-
culated on an identical basis to Table 8, the only exception being column
(a), where, in the absence of census data, estimates of family numbers
have been based aproximately on the surveyed data from the east, i.e. 1.25
families per holding. Table 11 summarises the planned involvement for the
western zone in the Project. The distibution of participating holdings,
areas and families between eastern and western zones differs slightly from
the figures in Chapter III because of rounding which has had the effect of
equalizing proposed participation east and west of the Rift Valley.

ANNEX 2
Page I
KENYA
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Organization, Management and Staffing
Broad Responsibilities and Project Coordination
1.        The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) would have overall responsi-
bility for implementing the Project. However, those aspects of the Project
involving the Cooperative Bank, the Kenya National Federation of Cooperatives
(KNFC), and Cooperative Societies and Unions would be implemented by the
Ministry of Cooperative Development (MCD). To ensure proper coordination of
this Project at the highest level, Government and the Bank agreed at negotia-
tions the establishment of an Interministerial Coordinating Committee under
the chairmanship of the Permanent Secretary of MOA. The MCD would be repre-
sented on the Committee by its Permanent Secretary and the Commissioner of
Cooperatives; the Ministry of Finance, AFC, the Maize and Produce Board (MPB),
the Cooperative Bank, KNFC, and the Horticultural Crops Development Authority
(HCDA) would each be represented by the Permanent Secretary or General Manager
of the institution.
2.        At district level the Project would come under the regular review
of the District Development Committee (chairmaned by the District Commis-
sioner) which would receive monthly and quarterly Project Reports from the
District Project Coordinator. There would also be Provincial Coordinators
to coordinate Project activities at the provincial level. As far as possible,
Provincial Commissioners, District Commisioners, Chiefs, and Sub Chiefs would
be closely associated with the Project and would be encouraged to advise
Project Staff, and to employ their considerable local influence in the
furtherance of Project objectives.
Detailed Organization (Chart)
3.        The Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), undergoes frequent reorganiza-
tions designed to enable it to cope better with the ever-changing pattern
of activities and projects (including this project) which it has to under-
take. The organization chart at the end of this report shows that Project
management (consisting of the Head of Program, Deputy Head of Program,
Financial Controller, and Evaluation Officer) and their supporting staff
(including provincial and district coordinators) would be located in the
Land and Farm Management Division of the Ministry of Agriculture.
4.        The Ministry of Cooperative Development has enough representation
at the provincial and district levels to enable close supervision of coopera-
tive activities in most areas. Indeed the Ministry frequently takes over



ANNEX 2
Page 2
the day-to-day management of ailing cooperative societies and unions. Manage-
ment standards in cooperative and other Project institutions would feature
prominently in the Work Plan (Chapter IV and Schedule).
Management and Staffing
5.        At completion in Year 5 the Project would be employing an incre-
mental staff complement totalling almost 900 and involving an annual wage bill
of about US$1 million.  Goverment is aware of this burden of recurrent cost
and is prepared to finance it on a continuing basis. The top management of
the Project Unit would consist of the Head of Program, his Deputy, the Finan-
cial Controller, and the Evaluation Officer, all to be located in the Land and
Farm Management Division of MOA. They would be supported by provincial
and district staff, and, through Project liaison officers one of whom would
be in each division of MOA, would be backed by the full range of services
supplied by that Ministry. The staffing of the MCD, AFC, KNFC, Cooperative
Bank, Cooperative Unions and Societies, MPB and HCDA would all be strengthened,
both at the Head Office and in the field, to enable them to perform their
project roles. Table 1 of this Annex details all the proposed staffing,
salary scales, and recruitment time-table. The qualifications and terms
of reference for the four most senior members of the Project Coordinating
UJnit are set out in the attached appendices.

INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMIENT PROJECT
Extension and Farmer Training
1.        The four most important factors militating,.against the effec-
tiveness of the extension service have been:
(a)  inadequate technical background of the jun or staff, thereby
requiring considerable in-service training.
(b) many of the good extension staff may be over-specialized,
without an appreciation of total farm needs. This calls for
reorientation courses to prepare such staff for the total
farm approach of projects such as this.
(c)  there are no clear incentives to encourage extension staff
to better performance.
(d) inadequate recurrent budgetary support has seriously reduced
mobility of extension staff as they frequently ran out of funds
for fuel for their vehicles.
These problems, and what this Project would do to alleviate them, are
discussed below.
Technical Background
2.        There are still at the lower levels of the extension service,
staff recruited many years ago, when the degree of technical training required
of a junior recruit was rather lower than today. Government policy is to
retrain such staff and thus improve their effectiveness in the extension
service, rather than reassign them to other duties. In keeping with that
policy, this Project would provide for the cost of short reorientation and
re-fresher courses for 3,700 extension staff members at farmer training
centers. It is recognized however, that this training is Project-oriented
(para 3 below), and cannot replace the widespread staff training program
being undertaken by MOA for country wide junior extension staff requirements.
Specialists Versus Generalists
3.        There has been some controversy regarding the appropriate degree
of specialisation for the lowest Level extension staff. Specialisation of
farm level staff in crop production (or in one or two crops, e.g. coffee
or tea) or in animal husbandry, was, to some extent at least, a response to
the criticism that generalist staff knew so littLe about any specific farm
problem that, sometimes, the farmer was better informed than they were.
On the othier hand, such specialisation sometimes went so far that junior
staff sometimes faiLed to appreciate, and frequentLv failed to address, the



ANNEX 3
Page 2
totality of the farm problems. Following the call for specialisation, there
are now, at farm level, a large number of junior specialist extension staff.
The formation of the Land and Farm Management Division was an effort to
reorientate extension staff towards the total farm concept. This is the
main problem which would be addressed by the Project orientation courses
planned for some 3,700 junior extension staff at the Farmer Training Centers
during the Project period (para 2 above). For the future MOA plans to limit
specialisation to a relatively small number of staff to be called in to
deal wi-th specific problems in their fields of specialisation. The bulk of
the lowest level staff, however, would be generalists under the control
of the new Deputy Director of Agriculture who would also be head of the
Extension and Training Division.
Staff Incentives
4.        The provision of incentives to high performance among extension
staff poses a number of difficult practical problems. Firstly, it is impos-
sible to identify good performance unless there are acceptable criteria for
assessing performance. At present such criteria are based largely on the
observations of supervisors and on farmers' reports. Nevertheless, such
evidence is frequently inconclusive. Secondly, even if it is possible to
identify good extension staff, it is difficult to offer them any financial
incentives or any other incentives based on improved employment benefits,
since these are governed by rules applying equally to all departments of the
civil service, and administered by the Public Service Commission. However,
MOA rewards good performance with more rapid promotions, sometimes into special
posts such as those being created under this Project.
Recurrent Budget
5.        Perhaps the commonest manifestation of inadequate budgetary alloca-
tions for recurrent expenditure on agricultural extension are the frequent
complaints by extension staff that they are unable, for long periods at
a time, to operate their vehicles, because of lack of fuel. Another frequently
heard complaint is that the Farmer Training Centers are closed for long
periods during the year, because they are not provided with adequate funds to
meet the costs (food, power, teaching materials, water, etc.) of farmer
training courses. In an effort to avoid these problems in the Project area,
the Project would provide for incremental operating costs of the extension
service vehicles, as well as the costs of running reorientation courses in the
FTCs during the Project period.
Farmer Training Centers (FTCs)
6.        There is at least one FTC in each of the districts proposed for the
Project, and information on FTC facilities and programs would be contained
in the Work Plan (Chapter IV and Schedule). Briefly, the FTC consists of a
large farm on which can be found the buildings necessary to accommodate groups
of farmers selected to attend orientation courses on a range of farming or
associated courses. The teaching element is based on the assumption that
farmers can be shown the real potential of agronomic recommendations made by



ANNEX 3
Page 3
extension personnel. The other element consists of business activities of
the (often sizeable) demonstration farms which could easily be financialLy
self-supporting. There are, therefore, two contrasted functions which
unfortunately are not, at present, financially distinct. In order to
fulfill these separate functions, it would be preferable to have separate
financial provision for, on the one hand, a teaching and accommodation
budget, and on the other, an attempt at commercially oriented farm manage-
ment. Current treasury regulations demand that revenue from crop or live-
stock production in the FTC immediately be passed into the revenue account.
As a result, towards the end of the financial year when funds are becoming
low, not only does the teaching often cease, but even vital farm operations
can be prejudiced by actual cash shortage. It is therefore considered
essential to operate the farm enterprise aspect of the FTC as a normal
commercial enterprise, either with an imprest account, or with net sur-
pluses paid to Government every year after retaining sufficient working
capital.
7.        The challenge to the agricultural officer-in-charge of ensuring
real profitability of the farm operation would serve a number of important
purposes. Firstly, the extension personnel would quickly learn the extent
to which their recommendations (frequently based solely on textbook informa-
tion) were applicable in their particular environment. Secondly, the problems
of timely use of on-farm inputs would be tested under field conditions.
Even where the investment might be more than the smallholder could perhaps
afford, at least there would be incontrovertible evidence of the potential.
Thirdly, those farmers selected for the course would at least be offered
the opportunity of questioning the practicability of the proposed input
package. Fourthly, the extension personnel would in turn be able to set up
an illustrative holding for which proper costings would be kept to arrive
at the economically viable technical packages.
8.        The educational value of the emphasis on the commercially oriented
farm would not be limited to the Junior or General Assistant grade of exten-
sion personnel. Even the District Agricultural Officers could well benefit
from the experience. Moreover, the feed back from FTC to farmer, and vice
versa, would highlight problems to which the Research Division could be
directed (such as variation in plant density to meet specific ecological
regions). The illustrative typical smallholder farm to be set up within
the FTC would also be valuable in determining yield, cost and income levels
which the smallholder could be expected to achieve. The problem of ensuring
proper accounting for all Treasury (or indeed any other) funds invested in
FTC commercial farm operations can be overcome hy an Imprest Account System
wqhereby each FTC is provided with an Imprest Fund for which it accounts to
the Treasury whenever the FTC seeks replenishment of the Imprest Account.

INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Input Supply
Distribution Channels
1.        The timely supply of the appropriate fertilizers, improved seeds,
insecticides and chemical sprays, has been one of the most significant con-
straints to small farmer production in Kenya, not only in remote areas but
also in other areas where smallholder cash crops have not made much headway.
2.        Historically the production and supply (including importation of
agricultural inputs where necessary) has been operated reasonably well by
the private sector. Three or four major suppliers have imported sufficient
balanced fertilizers for the country's requirements until 1973/74, when short-
ages occurred largely because of the critical world supply situation. The
major seeds are supplied by Kenya Seed Company (KSC), a successful commercial
business largely Government owned. Pesticides and insecticides are produced
or imported as necessary by the manufacturers or their local agents.
3.        So far, these various supplies have been distributed mainly through
two channels, namely, the Kenya Farmers Association (Cooperative) Limited
(KFA) and its network of branches and agents which have the most comprehensive
coverage, and the cooperative movement (para. 6). According to information
provided by the KFA, in 1975 it dealt with 2,212 stockists, who were supplied
inputs on a cash basis. Approximately 1,600 of the total appointees were
regular operators handling large quantities of supplies.
4.        Although KFA was originally orientated to large farmers, its
branhes and stockists carrying some 6,000 different items of merchandise
also provide a valuable service to smallholder agriculture. In 1974, more
than half of the total KFA sales were to small farmers.
5.        Despite these major inroads into smallholder agriculture, in the
medium and low potential areas including parts of Nyanza and Western pro-
vince (outside the Project) the KFA network is relatively thin among
smallholders. Many of the appointed traders either do not function at all
or carry very small quantities of inputs. Several factors reinforce the poor
availability of modern inputs and in particular fertilizer in these areas.
The fixed retail margins do not cover the cost of transportation to areas
poorly accessible by transport; the demand for fertilizer, and hence the
turnover is usually limited. Further, in the less comnercialized areas, the
merchants also have to incur additionaL costs in selling smaller quantities
than the 40, 50 and 100 kg bags in which the fertilizer is packaged. In
the past when inputs were sold on credit provided bv the AFC, there have
also been delays in reimbursement of merchants by the AFC. This situation



ANNEX 4
Page 2
has improved considerably in the recent months. Nevertheless, where the
scope for cash sales is limited and sales are contingent upon AFC credit,
stockists have been reluctant to deal in inputs. To some extent the
Project would help correct this situation through increasing demand for
fertilizer. However, it is necessary that expansion of input distri-
bution through private stockists not be held back through such policies as
regulation of market margins at excessively low levels, since traders would
promote cash sales of inputs in situations where profitability of innova-
tions is demonstrated and credit is not a constraint among smallholders.
6.        The second major channel of input distribution has been the coopera-
tive movement. Hitherto cooperatives and settlements have obtained supplies
of inputs from merchandisers against forward orders of their members, organized
on a society basis and distributed by them largely for cash crops. Following
the shortages of fertilizers experienced in 1973/74, and because of the size of
the operation, the Department of Cooperatives has initiated a merchandising
branch of the Kenya National Federation of Cooperatives (KNFC). This commenced
operations in the 1975 long rainy season primarily handling fertilizers. In
principle, this new system can play an important role in ensuring timely supply
of inputs to cooperative members. However, for it to be effective, consider-
able development of management capability is necessary both in the KMFC and
in the cooperative unions and societies. Further coordination of extension
advice with cooperative input distribution is needed to ensure that the right
inputs are ordered in the right mix and are available for distribution at the
right time and place. This is where a major gap exists, and this aspect is
highlighted in the proposed Work Plan (Chapter IV and Schedule).
7.        Once the cooperatives become multi-purpose they are also expected
to become the major channel for the distribution of seed, insecticides and
fertilizers for traditionally subsistence crops such as maize and beans.
There is no reason why cash sales of inputs should not be promoted through
cooperatives as well, so as to mobilize rural savings.
8.        Though it has had obvious weaknesses, the cooperative movement
is slowly being recognized as a suitable organization for input-output
handling. Due to the history of mismanagement, the Cotton Board, the other
possible channel for input distribution, does not enjoy a similar status.
Nor does the Cotton Board have any unique competence, either in terms of man-
power or a marketing network to handle inputs for crops other than cotton.
The negative attitude against the Board seems to be so strong and the develop-
ment eforts of the cooperatives are so far advanced that an increased role
for the Board in input supply does not seem called for. (Also see Annex 5
on cooperatives for additional reasons in support of this argument). The
project therefore envisages that the input marketing for cotton and other
crops be modeled after the Kenyan Coffee industry, which uses the Board mainly
for end-product marketing and the cooperative structure for input and produce
marketing.



ANNEX 4
Page 3
9.        However, no cooperative union or society should be allowed to
participate in project activities unless it is equipped with adequate
credit and marketing facilities. The district project coordinator should
draw on the Cotton Board branch manager, the extension staff, the district
agricultural officer and district cooperative officer for advice in determin-
ing type, quantity and timing of inputs needed. The Cotton Board itself would
thus not extend its activities to input marketing, but would play an advisory
role with regard to planning and ordering of inputs and their proper and
timely application.
10.       Total firm forward orders for fertilizers in 1974/75 were approxi-
mately 185,000 tons by all importers, of which some were subsequently
cancelled, and some could be available for export. In addition, consider-
able stocks of fertilizers existed with KNFC in 1975. Although these sur-
pluses were partly a result of unusually high fertilizer prices and the
consequent slackening of demand, given the small size of the marginal
increase expected in overall consumption as a result of the IADP, there is
not expected to be a shortage in the supplies either of fertilizer or of
seed and chemicals to the target population in the first phase of the
project.
Input Pricing
11.       As of March 1976, Government was the only importer of fertilisers.
By requiring a standard farmgate fertilizer price across the country, Govern-
ment is in effect subsidising transport costs to the more remote areas.
Apart from this, there is no policy to subsidise fertiliser prices. In pricing
inputs in the IADP areas there is a dual objective: (i) to further the effic-
iency in the production, processing and marketing of cash crops including in
particular of cotton, currently the major cash crop in Western and Nyanza
provinces and (ii) to improve the productivity of the overall farming system
through use of cotton and other cash crops as a (credit) security. The
pricing and delivery of inputs need to take this duality into account.
12.       The provision of information on expected price and demand develop-
ment both for inputs and crops will be an important part of input marketing.
Such information will be crucial for making allocative decisions, particularly
since the farmer is usually in a poor position to make such forecasts and in
great need of advice.
13.       Nevertheless, if cash crops are to act as anchor crops there has to
be some minimum production of the cash crop. The question as to the appro-
priate level of cash crop production, as well as the extent to which farmers
should be allowed to secure their credit, by growing sunflower, tobacco or
other suitable security crops, will have to be determined on a case-by-case
basis jointly by the extension staff, the District Agricultural Committee and
Cooperatives before approving each applicant for credit.



ANNFX 4
Page 4
14.       As cotton is a seasonal crop the extension advice will depend on
the possible use of cotton as an anchor crop for the particular season and
on the profitability of growing cotton. Prices will have to be fixed on a
year to year basis for both inputs and outputs and advice given on the basis
of price relationships.
15.       It might be valuable to investigate the possibilities of subsidiz-
ing certain inputs temporarily, as for instance, spraying services, to get
higher acceptance. However, apart from such temporary subsidies, input
prices should be fixed strictly on cost basis and should depend on the effi-
ient operations of the input marketing organization in question. By the
same token, official prices of output should reflect market costing and
should be designed to provide the farmer enough incentive to produce.

KENYA
INTERGRATED AGRICULTURAT. DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
The Cooperative Mcvement in Kenya
1.        The cooperative movement in Kenya is expected to play a pivotal
role in the Project. Through its various agencies the movement will be res-
ponsible for distribution of most of the seasonal credit to be provided under
the Project and of related inputs including fertilizer, insecticides and labor,
as the credit will be distributed in kind. The marketing and processing of
a major portion of the output to be produced under the Project is also ex-
pected to be handled by the cooperative movement.
Cooperative Growth
2.        The importance of the cooperative movement has been on the increase
over time but has varied significantly among crops and regions. At the begin-
ning of the 1974-78 Development Plan, there were an estimated 1,060 active
cooperative societies in Kenya, with a total membership of about 450,000 people.
Of these, about 800 societies served rural areas including the settlement
schemes. Approximately 600 were agricultural marketing societies, most con-
centrating on a single commodity, such as coffee, pyrethrum, cotton and dairy
products. About 90 percent of the pyrethrum, 50 percent of the coffee and 25%
of all milk sold by farmers in Kenya is estimated to be marketed through the
primary societies. To support the primary societies, about 40 District Co-
operative UJnions have been established which provide centralized services
including accounting, book-keeping, transport, storage, credit and savings
facilities.
3.        The 1974-78 Development Plan document states the Government's commit-
ment to consolidate and expand the role of the cooperative movement in Kenya
during and beyond the plan period. The Cooperative Development Policy of Kenya
is outlined in detail in the Government's Sessional Paper No. 8 of 1970 which has
been up-dated by Sessional Paper No. 14 of 1975.
The Primary Societies and the Unions
4.        Most of the primary cooperative societies are marketing and process-
ing societies, organized to market farm produice. Although most specialize in
a single commodity, some societies have expanded their operations to cover
marketing of several commodities. Some have also expanded their role into
activities other than marketing, for example, supply of farm inputs including
fertilizer, seed, and pesticide; adninistration of the tractor hire service,
and cattle dipping facilities; and provision of short-term credit. Such
societies are known as "multi-purpose" cooperatives. It is the Government's
intention to convert all the rural cooperatives over the next several vears



ANNEX 5
Page 2
into multi-commodity, multi-purpose societies. Such a trend is already
visible, since in some cases, 2 or more single commodity cooperatives in
the same geographical area have been merged into single societies at the
suggestion of the Department of Cooperative Development.
5.        There is another major category of cooperatives in the rural
areas, known as the "land purchase" cooperatives, formed to facilitate
purchase and operation of large farms that were previously owned by
Europeans. In addition, there are some societies that are concerned with
livestock production, fishing and handicrafts.
6.        Cooperative unions coordinate the activities of primary societies
in a given area, and usually, are related to a single commodity. On behalf
of the primary societies, the unions also deal with the countrywide cooper-
atives, marketing boards and the Cooperative Bank, and provide societies
assistance in keeping accounts, planning, purchase and storage activities.
Like the cooperative societies, the cooperative unions are also expected to
diversify their activities in the future, becoming multi-commodity and multi-
purpose unions. Most primary societies do not have any hired clerical or
management staff. Such staff is usually hired and paid by the unions.
Societies do employ some laborers and factory workers.
7.        A farmer can be a member of several cooperative societies and
receive services and credit facilities from all of them. The need for multi-
ple membership is expected to disappear in the future with the development
of multi-commodity cooperatives.
Countrywide Cooperatives
8.        Apart from the primary societies and unions, there are several
countrywide cooperative organizations. These include the Kenya Planters
Cooperative Union, which undertakes the marketing and processing of coffee,
the Kenya Cooperative Creameries Limited, which carries out the majority of
milk marketing and enjoys a near monopoly in marketing of milk in major
cities, the Horticultural Cooperative Union which markets vegetables and
fruit and the Kenya Farmers Association (Cooperative) Limited, which plays a
major role in supplying farm inputs and in marketing farm products, the
last involving mostly large scale commercial farmers. The Cooperative Bank
of Kenya is a national cooperative that provides banking services to other
cooperative organizations. Finally, there is an apex organization of the
cooperatives, the Kenya National Federation of Cooperatives, to which many
of the primary societies, unions and the other countrywide cooperatives be-
long.
The Department of Cooperatives Development
9.        The Department of Cooperative Development was established with the
aim of promoting the development of cooperatives, providing guidance and
exercising stipervision and controL.  Under the Cooperative Societies Act of



ANNEX 5
Page 3
1966 and the Cooperative Act and the Cooperative Rules (1969), the Commissioner
for Cooperative Development has been given wide powers to regulate the co-
operatives, including the right to remove the committee of a society or replace
it for a limited time, to enforce amalgamation of uneconomic societies, to en-
sure that expenditures are kept within approved budgets, and to prescribe
policies governing the credit activities of the cooperative unions and societies.
10.       The Department promotes development through assistance in management,
implementation of accounting systems, credit schemes and training programs for
the cooperative staff. A major function of the Department is to audit the
accounts of the various cooperative unions (and, in some cases, societies). Tn
addition to the Commissioner of Cooperative Development, who is the Registrar
of Cooperative Societies and has overall responsibility for the cooperative
movement in Kenya, there are Assistant Commissioners for cooperative develop-
ment (or the Provincial Cooperative Officers) who supervise the cooperative
movement in the provinces, and the District Cooperatives Officers who coordinate
and control the cooperatives in the districts.
11.       The Department of Cooperative Development had issued a directive in
1974 to all primary societies and unions, setting an upper limit on the total
overhead costs and commissions charged to the farmers by unions and societies.
The unions and societies together are allowed to charge no more than 20% of
the value of the farmer's produce handled by the cooperative organizations,
(this includes commissions for marketing, input supply services, transportation
costs and office overheads, but does not include interest on the credit supplied).
However, there are a number of societies which are currently exceeding the set
limit on overhead expenses; the Department has not taken action against then
so far on the assumption that the situation can be improved gradually through
the Nordic program which is directed to correcting the overall deficiencies in
the cooperative movement including inexperienced and poorly trained management,
inadequate book-keeping systems, and generally low level of public account-
ability.
Technical Assistance
12.       The "Nordic program" is a sizeable program of technical assistance
from a consortium of Scandinavian countries. It has been operating in Kenya
since 1967 with the objective of developing and consolidating the cooperative
movement. About 40 advisers are currently assisting various cooerative organ-
izations throughout Kenva under this program.  Mkost of them are assigned to one
of the cooperative unions; about 5 are at the headquarters of the Department of
Cooperatives and 4 are with the Kenya National Federation of Cooperatives, work-
ing on developing adequate accounting systems and book-keeping, organization of
credit and planning of the cooperative activities. The Nordic technical assist-
ance program has been substantially effective in strengthening several of the
societies, particularly in the coffee and pyrethrum areas. This program is now
heing slowly phased out and, according to the present plan, is expected to
terminate after 1977. The IJSAID loan (which is taking the role of the forerun-
ner of the Integrated AgriculturaL Development Project on a small scale), has a



ANNEX 5
Page 4
a modest technical assistance component providing for approximately 10
peace corps volunteers and other advisers who will work in areas adjacent
to the Project area.
The Kenya National Federation of Cooperatives
13.       This apex organization of all the cooperatives in Kenya came into
existence in 1964. Although the charter of KNFC envisaged a much wider
role, in recent years its activities have been restricted to the formal
representation of the cooperatives in their relations with the Government,
information and publicity including a weekly radio program and publication of
a quarterly news magazine "Mshiriki wa Kenya", training for the junior staff
of the cooperative societies, group insurance to cover the property owned by
its member cooperatives and supply of stationery and supply of farm inputs to
the cooperative societies had been added to its activities. The KNFC is able
to purchase inputs at bulk rates and hopes to distribute them to the various
societies at competitive prices. At present, only about 10 percent of the
total farm inputs sold to Kenya farmers is being supplied through the KNFC
channel. Participation of KNFC in merchandising of inputs is also hoped
to yield the additional benefit of stabilizing input prices and guaranteeing
timely supplies. To be effective in this regard, the KNFC will have to
strengthen its management significantly and assistance would be provided
through the Project in the form of equipment, vehicles and staffing, to enable
KNFC to fulfill its Project role.

KENYA
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAI, DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Agricultural Credit and Credit Institutions
Type of Coverage
1.        All smallholders selected for participation in the Project would
be eligible for seasonal credit. The Project would also have a subsistence
farmers credit (SFCF) through which an effort would be made to introduce a
cash crop to subsistence farmers.  The objective would be to incorporate such
farmers in the main stream of institutional services. The subsistence farmer
fund is described later in this Annex. From year 5 on the fund is expected to
benefit about 3,500 farmers per year. The total number of smallholders ex-
pected to be affected by the Project is estimated at 70,000 (equivalent to
around 324,000 people) cultivating 56,000 holdings.
2.        Credit would be seasonal and would cover both food crops (maize,
beans, potatoes), and cash crops (cotton, passion fruit, groundnuts and
sunflower). In the Project's livestock component, credit for such items as
pasture improvement, construction of water tanks and acquisition of oxen or
improved zebu bulls would continue to be made available through existing
credit schemes and will not be covered by this Project.
3.        Credit would primarily be made available to farmers associated
with cooperative societies that have monopoly buying or processing positions,
although participating cooperatives would not necessarily be limited to the
specific crops involved in the Project. Farmers who live in areas not served
by cooperatives, or had deposited their title deeds with AFC to secure previous
loans, or are borrowing from AFC for non-seasonal purposes would be able to
receive credit through AFC. The relative amounts of cooperative and AFC
lending would be agreed annually through the mechanism of Work Plans (Schedule).
Credit Channels
4.        Money for seasonal credit would be loaned by Government to the
Cereals and Sugar Finance Corporation (CSFC)1/ for 20 years to operate a
revolving fund for which funds would be on-lent to the Cooperative Bank and
AFC for 2 year periods to enable them to extend credit to farmers (see paras.
48 to 56).
Rural Cooperatives
5.        In December 1975, societies representing crop marketing, livestock
including dairy, multipurpose and farm purchase numbered approximately 1,500
with total membership exceeding 600,000. However, the credit operations of
the cooperative movement are relatively young, and to date, there are 13
1/   CSFC is a small corporation established under the Cereals and Sugar
Finance Corporation Act (L.K. Cap. 329), located within the Treasury, and
used by the Kenya Government ailmost excltusively as a channel for on-lending
Project funds to other institutions.



ANNEX 6
Page 2
unions with 126 member societies which are providing, in addition to their
primary marketing or production function, the services of supplying inputs,
credit through the Cooperative Production Credit Scheme (CPCS) and a sav-
ings plan. A further 600 societies are active in providing limited crop
advances together with minimal supplies of inputs.
6.        The CPCS scheme has been implemented mainly in Central and Eastern
Provinces and, to a lesser extent in Western and Nyanza Provinces. Approxi-
mately 60,000 loans were made under CPCS during 1970-73, totalling Ksh 31 mil-
lion, an average of about 520 shillings per borrower. The societies operating
the scheme at the end of 1973 involved an active membership of 205,000 farmers.
The repayment record has exceeded 90 percent.
7.        The Department of Cooperative Development proposes to provide the
CPCS and savings schemes to between 290,000 and 335,000 members, i.e. 48-56
percent of the total membership by 1978. It is the aim of the Project to assist
in ensuring that this target is reached, particularly by strengthening coverage
in Western and Nyanza province, while achieving the good record of the CPCS
scheme realized elsewhere.
8.        Approximately 30 percent of the cooperative unions and societies now
operating the CPCS and savings program have acquired capital approaching double
the amount required by these unions for on-lending to members for short-term
lending purposes. Finance for short-term credit is not currently a constraint
for these, (generally) the oldest and most efficient unions, although it is
still a constraint for others.
Agricultural Credit through the Cooperative System
The Cooperative Bank
9.        Established in 1968, the Cooperative Bank of Kenya is a specialized
financial institution serving the cooperative system, and offers cooperative
societies banking services designed to meet their special needs. The Coop-
erative Bank has one office, located in Nairobi. It is registered both as
a commercial bank and as a cooperative organization. It does not provide a
full range of banking services and has no individual depositors, but serves as
the financial arm of the cooperative system. It offers its customers (limited
to cooperative societies) banking services designed to meet their specific
needs, and is also designed to support Government efforts to strengthen the
cooperative movement.  The aim of the Cooperative Bank is to pool funds
generated by cooperatives and to make them available to the cooperative
movement. The Bank was founded because it was felt that cooperative societies
in the commercial banking system were large in relation to the services
extended to cooperatives by commercial banks and that the volume of coopera-
tive transactions was sufficient to justify the existence of a specialized
bank. For day-to-day convenience, cooperative societies generally maintain
accounts at a commercial bank branch in the nearest commercial center. The
Cooperative Bank lends to societies under the Cooperative Production Credit
Scheme for crop finance, and also provides a limited amount of medium-term
finance for coffee factories, cotton ginneries and other investments under-
taken by cooperatives including land purchase, buildings and vehicles.



ANNEX 6
Page 3
10.        Under the Cooperative Production Credit Scheme, individual farmers
and primarY societies may borrow in kind from their unions under a standard
formula, subject to the approval of the society's credit committee (which in-
cludes the society's management and the local extension officer). The farmer's
borrowing limit is set at 2/3 of his annual production of cash crop handled by
the society, based on experience over the past three years; the total credit
extended is limited by the amount of credit available to the society from its
own members' savings and other cooperative societies. Societies lend against
estimated crop proceeds and require that letters of undertaking covering re-
payments be obtained from statutory buying boards before credit is extended.
Each borrower must also provide security in the form of two guarantors.
11.       In addition to the CPCS loans, some cooperative societies also ad-
vance seasonal loans amounting to up to 10 percent of the value of the farmer's
estimated cash crop production. This credit can be available to the farmer up
to 4 times a year, but under the condition that his previous borrowing under
this 10 percent scheme has been fully repaid before he can borrow the next
time. This scheme is supported by the Cooperative Bank through the "crop
advances" (short-term credit of 3-6 months maturity) from the Bank to the
unions and societies.
12.       The individual unions and societies are not allowed by the Department
of Cooperatives to relax the conditions under which credit is granted to the
farmers. The only exceptions to this rule are the experimental credit schemes
tried as part of special development assistance, principally in the Special
Rural Development Project (SRDP) areas.
Lending Rates through the Cooperatives
Cooperative Bank to Unions/Societies
13.       In recent years the Cooperative Bank has been borrowing at the rate
of 4-1/2 percent from the Government. Lending rates from Cooperative Bank to
Unions or Societies are:
(1) CPCS loans - prime rate (up to 18 months) approximately
8 percent in July 1975.
(2) 3-6 month crop advances - about 9 percent.
(3)  Medium term loans for implements, vehicles, etc. (2 years) -
about 9 percent.
(4) Long term loans (2-5 years) for land purchases, processing
plants - 9 to 10 percent under reducing balances.



ANNEX 6
Page 4
14.       Longest maturity of loans from the Cooperative Bank is 5 years.  The
bad debts of the Cooperative Bank have so far been very few, with a repayment
rate of about 98 percent. This has of course been largely a result of limiting
the cooperative activities to the traditional export crops, most of which re-
quire further processing and therefore, facilitate centralized marketing.
Unions and Societies to Farmers
15.       On short-term loans (including CPCS), the unions/societies charge
farmers a margin of 2% to 4% for their services. No margin is charged on
medium and long-term loans.
Participants
16.       Eighteen of the cooperative unions in Kenya participate in the CPCS
scheme; about 225 primary societies administer the CPCS to their members,
largely in coffee and pyrethrum growing areas.
17.       As of June 30, 1974, K.Sh. 123 million of the total Cooperative Bank
funding consisted of members' deposits. K.Sh. 7 million consisted of fully
paid shares of 100 Sh each, K.Sh. 3 million was made up of long-term loans
from Kenya Government, and K.Sh. 0.5 million was from reserves. The bulk of
these funds (K.Sh. 97 million or 72%) was held as money at call and short
notice, K.Sh. 33 million (24%) in loans and overdrafts, and the rest in other
asset forms. A statement of sources and allocation of funds is in Table 1
and a detailed Income and Expenditure Account is in Table 2.
The Agricultural Finance Corporation
18.       The other major credit institution which would be involved in the
Project is the Agricultural Finance Corporation (AFC). It was established in
1963 as a statutory body to take over the credit functions of the two Boards
of Agriculture then serving the Scheduled (European) and Nonscheduled (African)
Areas, and to work in close cooperation with the Land and Agricultural Bank
established in 1931. Under the AFC Act of 1969, AFC was reconstituted with
wider powers and took over the operations and assets and liabilities of the
Land and Agricultural Bank. The present functions of the corporation are to
assist in the development of agriculture and agricultural industries by making
loans to farmers, cooperative societies, incorporated group representatives,
private companies public bodies, local authorities and other persons engaging
in agriculture or agricultural industries. At present, AFC is the primary
agricultural credit institution in Kenya and it is the only lender serving the
farm sector through a variety of lending programs to the commercially oriented
farms large or small.
19.       AFC currently extends credit under three large-scale schemes sup-
ported by external donors. The first scheme covers land purchase and develop-
ment loans financed under the British Land Transfer Program. The major compo-
nents of the transfer program were: (i) settlement schemes, involving pre-
dominantly smallholdings but also including some medium to large-scaLe farms



ANNEX 6
Page 5
and some cooperative units; (ii) the British Land Transfer Assisted Owners
Scheme thrni.gh which transFer of farms; ' med by UK citizens and located out-
side settlement areas was facilitated by providing funds to the Kenya Govern-
ment for on-lending to AFC; and (iii) the Stamp Purchase Plan which was ini-
tiated in 1966 to finance the purchase and transfer of tihe remaining British
owned farms which comprised some of the best farms in the country and to en-
sure their contribution as single units in order to safeguard what was con-
sidered the unique economic advantage of this scale of activity.
20.       The second of the large-scale schemes involves ranching loans funded
jointly by IDA, Sweden, and USAID. These are designed to assist in the devel-
opment of different types of ranching organizations (group, company, indivi-
dual and commercial ranching enterprises) and involves the establishment and
improvement of technical services for the ranching sector plus investment in
livestock routes and marketing facilities.
21.       The third scheme is comprised of the large farm development programs
supported by the overseas development finance institution of the Federal
Republic of Germany, Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KFW), to provide funds
for the establishment of state-owned animal breeding farms and for the ration-
alization of large-scale African farms in the Trans Nzoia District. Funds
were made available to AFC for on-lending to a number of large-scale African
farmers in the Kitale area wnose farms it was expected could benefit from in-
jections of capital. An agricultural team provided under German foreign
assistance is operating in this area, and loan funds were provided to support
their extension activities.
22.       AFC is also extending credit under two small-scale programs which
include smallholder development projects funded by IDA and KFW. These projects
were designed to provide credit for on-farm development and to assist in di-
versifying and improving crops and animal husbandry practices of selected
smallholders. Included also is a small poultry development element, financing
for farm machinery and equipment, and a technical assistance element providing
for an agricultural credit survey in Kenya.
23.       In addition to those schemes supported by external donors, AFC
operates small-scale and large-scale lending schemes from its own resources
(mainly from capital provided by the Government). From its own resources, AFC
also operates a large-scale lending program which provides both land purchase
and development loans as a supplement to those provided by the British Land
Transfer Program. Although no firm breakdown of large-scale loans by purpose
is available, it is estimated that aoproximately 60 percent of all large-scale
loans irrespective of the source of financing are for land purchase, about 30
percent are for on-farm development and about 7 percent are for repayment of
outstanding debts other than those owed to AFC. These debt consolidating
loans are granted to enable AFC to obtain a charge over the farmer's assets,
and such a consolidation is generally considered to be to the farmer's advan-
tage as the AFC loan is normally at a lower rate of interest than is obtainable
elsewhere and it is usually accompanied by farm planning services.



ANNEX 6
Page 6
24.       Small-scale programs generally provide funds in amounts up to KShs
10,000, while large-scale schemes are typically much larger and often finance
quite different farm enterprises. The ratio of large-scale to small-scale
loans outstanding as of March 31, 1973 stood at 6:1, although of course, AFC has
many more small-scale than large-scale borrowers. AFC's large-scale portfolio
includes land purchase loans which are extended for a 30-year term, while prac-
tically all of the small-scale loans are for land and enterprise development,
on terms ranging from 3 to 10 years; the small-scale portfolio thus has a more
rapid turnover than the large-scale portfolio. Due to AFC's requirement of
land-title as the security for loans (described below) few low income, small
farmers are willing or able to surrender land titles for a small amount of
seasonal credit. Moreover AFC makes its loans to individual farmers and not
on a group (cooperative) basis and this severely limits the number of farmers
which it can reach. Therefore even after the recent decentralization of AFC's
credit administration, which has simplified the lending procedures, the
pattern of lending has not changed to include larger numbers of low income
small farmers.
25.       AFC lends on a secured basis, generally against mortgages on land,
and in certain instances charges are also taken against movable property.
In general, the coverage should not be less than 1-1/2 times the approved
loan. When the loan is in default, the entire amount outstanding becomes due
automatically under a clause included in AFC's loan agreements. However, at
stages short of foreclosure AFC does not exercise its right to call the entire
amount outstanding. The Corporation has recently instituted a policy of
paying interest (at approximately 5% p.a.) to borrowers who make prepayments
through monthly payments to AFC in anticipation of larger sums which fall due
quarterly.
26.       Management and Organization.  AFC was transferred to the office of
the President in June 1970, but no changes were made in the composition of its
Board of Directors. The M4inistry of Finance and Planning and the Ministry of
Agriculture are represented on the Board by their Permanent Secretaries, and
the Secretary of Finance and Planning currently serves as Chairman of the Board.
In addition to the two Permanent Secretaries, the board consists of between
four and six Ministerial appointees (two of whom are required to have expe-
rience in banking or finance) drawn from official and private sources.
27.       AFC has a fairly centralized structure, with a Head Office located
in Nairobi and a network of 32 branch offices which provide coverage of
Kenya's principal agricultural districts.   During the past two years some
decentralization has taken place in an effort to spread the administrative
burden and to use the existing staff more effectively. Four Area Managers
play a vital role in the decentralization process, as each is responsible
for the guidance and supervision of offices in his geographical area of re-
sponsibility. Three of the area managers were provided by USAID and the



ANNEX 6
Page 7
fourth was provided by German Aid. Most of the loan approvals for small-scale
loans are made at the Head Office on the recommendations of branch managers,
although an initial screening takes place in the field in two stages. In the
first stage extension staff advise farmers to obtain an AFC loan application
and assist them to fill it in; at the second stage District Loan Committees
(whliich include branch managers and extension officers) advise AFC's head
office on the credit worthiness of prospective borrowers in their respec-
tive districts.
28.       Financial Resources.  The bulk of AFC's financial resources is pro-
vided by the Government. It consists partly of irredeemable or ownership
capital, some of which is interest-bearing (originally belonging to the pre-
decessor corporation, the Land and Agricultural Bank), and partly of interest-
free grants, and redeemable or long-term debt capital. As of March 31, 1974,
irredeemable capital amounted to Ksh 127 million (US$16 million), of which
Ksh 47 million (US$5.8 million) was interest free grants. Redeemable loans
which include proceeds of loans to Government from IDA and other external
sources which were on-lent to AFC amounted to Ksh 151 million (US$18.8 mil-
lion) as of that date. Prior to the effectiveness of the IDA Smallholder
Credit Project in 1967, AFC was charged interest by Government at 6% p.a.,
but since that date all funds have been provided at 3.5% p.a. in accordance
with the terms of the IDA credit which stipulated that Government would not
charge more than 3.5% p.a. on any future loans to AFC made while AFC is in-
debted with respect to that project. For fiscal year 1973 the blend of
interest payable averaged 4.5% on interest bearing capital or 3.5% on total
resources including interest free grants. Financial statements for 1971 to
1974 are in Table 3. AFC actually made a profit of Ksh 4 million in the
first half of 1975/76 and now expects to make a profit for the whole of that
year (Table 4). In any case, the impact of this Project on AFC's finances
is expected to be small. Project credit funds expected to pass through AFC
amount to only 10% of AFC's preProject financial resources. AFC is profit-
able now, and Government seems determined to keep it so.
29.       The allocation of credit for inputs to Cooperatives or AFC would be
proposed in Work Plans and agreed between Government and the Bank. Present
indications are that K.Sh 28 million or 25% of credit for inputs in this
Project would pass through AFC, and the rest through the Cooperatives.
This represents about 10% increase of AFC's net loans to farmers in 1975.
To cope with this increase in activity, AFC's staff is being strengthened
under the Project with a Head Office accountant, 3 senior administrative
officers, 20 field officers and 16 clerical officers.
30.       Through its 33 branches, AFC is reaching some 16,500 small-scale
farmers. 1/  Historically the mair constraints to increasing the number of
small scale loans have been the time consuming aspect of dealing with indi-
vidual farmers, resistance of AFC to small and administratively expensive
loans, and, particularly, the lengthy administrative procedures, involving
depositing of title deeds, which has resulted in an average time lapse of
? months between application and disbursements.
/ Defined as loans not exceeding KShs 10,000 per indivdual.



ANNEX 6
Page 8
31.       This last constraint is now being removed by way of decentralizing
lending authority to the branch level, and restructuring the loan applica-
tion procedure. In addition, the AFC as a matter of policy has agreed to
participate in providing seasonal loans to small-scale farmers until such
time as the cooperative society organization can satisfy this need. As a
result, loan processing should now take 3-4 weeks for short-term loans, and
2-3 weeks for small-scale seasonal credit. The decentralization program has
been introduced in 7 AFC branches in the Mount Kenya area (November 1974).
The Western area was to follow in February 1975, with the other 3 areas being
gradually phased in thereafter, in line with program objectives.
32.       AFC's loans to smallholders are secured by title deeds; the average
size of these loans has previously ranged from Kshs 3,000 to 4,000 for both
medium term loans (2 years) 1/ and crop financing. AFC has only provided
seasonal credit as an agent of Central Agricultural Board, in the form of
Guaranteed Minimum Return (GMR) loans, for wheat and maize only; these bene-
fit only larger farmers (i.e. basic requirement minimum of 15 areas of wheat
or maize.
Capacity of Credit Agencies
33.       The two existing channels for short-term loans and seasonal credit
to small-scale farmers, the Cooperatives and AFC, provide sufficient geo-
graphical coverage for proposed Project lending. The immediate additional
capacity of AFC, which involves processing of applications and limited super-
vision in conjunction with the Ministry of Agriculture extension staff, has
been estimated at 300 applicatons per AFC branch officer. Cooperative
Societies are expected to handle a similar number. At present the small-
holder credit situation in Kenya is somewhat confused, because of the over-
lapping roles played by AFC and the cooperative societies. AFC operates
efficiently and provides a valuable lending source in areas inadequately
covered by cooperative societies. On a district by district basis, the two
sources adequately cover the proposed Project locations. However, in the
long term, their respective roles in smallholder lending would have to be more
clearly defined.
34.       The field extension service of the Ministry of Agriculture should
be able to determine the effectiveness of the credit system since it coor-
dinates the bodies involved and leads the loan approval committees.   The
extension staff should provide continuing contact with the farmers to advise
on agricultural production. So far, the extension service has been unable
to determine credit effectiveness and coordinate credit administration.
The Project hopes to rectify this deficiency by improved organization,
training and supervision.
1/   IDA Credit 105 experience; most of these loans were for:  2 dairy
cows, fencing, a water tank, dairy equipment and some crop develop-
ment (from:  Credit 105-KE, Completion  Report of July 11, 1974).

Financial Requirements
35.       The farm budgets have estimated the following requirements of
seasonal inputs for Project crop development:
Crop                   Ksh/ha                Crop                  Ksh/ha
Maize                             911
Groundnut                       1,120               Cotton                   653
Irish Potatoes                  2,180               Beans                    616
Passion Fruit                   3,340
The weighted average credit requirement is some KSh 762 per ha for crop
production.
36.       Total seasonal and short term credit requirements during the Project
are calculated as KSh112 million 1/ for the 5-year Project period. 2/  These
funds would be channelled largely through the Cooperative System, but also
through AFC.
Training and Technical Assistance
AFC
37.       The decentralization program of AFC, which will improve speed and
capacity of handling seasonal credit, is now being implemented. Additional
staff, mostly trained in agriculture, are being hired; under the Project,
provision would be made for additional accountants, supervisors and book-
keeping staff, in addition to vehicles for supervision and training programs
(para 28).
1/   This consists of 75% of the total requirement for physical inputs
and hired labor (Annex 10, Tables 11, 12 and 13).
2/   There are only 4 farming years in the 5-year Project period.



ANNEX 6
Page 10
Cooperatives
38.       The Cooperative sector is at present being assisted with about 40
expatriate (Nordic) staff: most of these are assigned to credit (8), account-
ing (10) and planning (11). This team is due to be reduced by approximately
ten members by 1977. Training for the cooperative societies -- managers, book-
keepers -- is being carried out at the Kenya Cooperative College, Langata.
The capacity of this College would be adequate for the needs of the Coopera-
tive system. Unfortunately, however, over 50 percent of its graduates seek
employment elsewhere. This situation arises from the relatively low salary
structure of the cooperatives, and the absence of an identifiable career
structure within the system that would enable managers to be posted to
different societies and gain additional experience. This matter is now
receiving Government attention, and is not expected to adversely affect the
manpower requirements of the Project (see Annex 2).
39.       The cooperatives are most vulnerable on the bookkeeping and account-
ing aspects. If, upon inspection, they are judged to be deficient in the
following areas;
(1)  development of accounting systems, with possibilities for
management control;
(2)  training of bookkeepers to adequately maintain accounts
as developed under 1; and
(3)  training of controllers to check performance of bookkeepers.
It is recommended that the technical assistance function being carried out by
Nordics should be extended beyond 1977 either through them or through an
alternate external assistance program. This aspect would be covered in the
proposed Work Plans.
Subsistence Farmers Credit Fund (SFCF)
40.       Most project farmers are unlikely to have ready access to AFC,
because of the small size of their individual seasonal credit requirements.
The farmer who already has a marketable surplus would be assisted for his
credit needs by the cooperative system (or AFC). However, the real subsis-
tence farmer, i.e. the farmer without a marketable surplus, would not be
serviced either by the Cooperatives 1/ or by AFC; and there is at present no
institution designed specially to deal with the credit needs of this class of
farmers.
1/   For a cooperative society member to receive credit, he must have
marketed his output through that society for 2-3 years. This marketed
surplus, together with the associated proven farming ability, are used
as a basis for deciding the size of the loan. By definition, therefore,
subsistence farmers cannot get credit from the cooperatives under existing
rules.



ANNEX 6
Page 11
41.       The Project, therefore, proposes to expand the ongoing pilot scheme
which would enable subsistence farmers to produce a marketable surplus, which
they would sell through the cooperatives. They would then qualify for seasonal
credit from cooperative societies in the normal way. After a few years of
on-farm development using cooperative credit, the farmer may also become
eligible for AFC loans (both short and medium term).
42.       In order to enable the subsistence farmer to produce a surplus,
and hence something to market cooperative societies, through the approved
suppliers and extension service, would make credit available under a new small
farmer scheme.
43.       Thereafter if a farmer (i) has successfully followed the advice
of the extension service, and (ii) has marketed his surplus through the
Co-operative Society, would be eligible for credit from the Co-operatives
to finance his inputs. Farmers who have not been able to benefit from this
opportunity would not be further assisted.
Organization
44.       For the assistance program for subsistence farmers to be effective
and for it to reach the people for whom it is designed, the following steps
are proposed:
(i) classification of farmers into subsistence and commercial
categories -- this would be defined by central Ministry of
Agriculture in conjunction with provincial officers, who would
also suggest through Work Plans, a phasing programme by locations.
A legal definition of the subsistence farmer for this purpose is
contained in paragraph 56(a) below.
(ii)  screening of applicants -- this would be undertaken at district
level in accordance with the district agricultural committees;
(iii)  entering memberships for acceptors at local Co-operative
Society;
(iv)  supplying input packages consisting of seed, pesticides and
fertiliser;
(v) regular follow-up by extension service; and
(vi)  mandatory marketing through Co-operative Societies.
45.       Classification of farmers, and screening would be undertaken by
the members of district agricultural committees, including:
District Commissioner,
District Agricultural Officer,
District Land and Farm Management Officer,
Co-operative Union Members (2).



ANNEX 6
Page 12
The committee's decision would be based on advice from the following
who would not have voting power:
-    Chief of Division
-    Sub-Chief of Location
-    Division Assistant Agricultural Officer
-    Extension Staff (2)
46.       Like the rest of the Scheme for farm inputs SFCF would commence at
the start of the second Project year (i.e. March/April 1977) and reach approxi-
mately 3,500 farmers cultivating 2,800 holdings out of the Project total of
70,000 farmers and 56,000 holdings as follows:-
Indicative Program for Inclusion of Subsistence Farmers
Zone            Year 2       Year 3         Year 4        Totals
1977/78      1978/79       1979/80
Eastern            500         500            700          1,750
Western            500         500            700          1,750
Totals           1,000      1,100           1,400          3,500
47.        Although it will reach only a small number of subsistence farmers
(5% of total Project objective) the program will provide a valuable basis
from which to expand this approach during subsequent phases. The cost per
farmer would be exactly the same as for other Project farmers (see Annex 10,
Tables 11, 12 abd 13).
48.        The proceeds of the Credit, the Loan and the BADEA Loan lent by
the Government to CSFC shall be repaid within twenty years including five
years' grace.
49.        Interest rates to be charged in respect of the relending of proceeds
of the Credit, the Loan and the BADEA Loan and the maximum repayment periods
in respect thereof shall be as follows:

paragraph 50 below)
50.       Loans to farmers shall be repayable in the shortest period consis-
tent with the farmer's ability to repay in view of the crop for which credit
is extended, and amortization payments shall be calculated so as to coincide
as far as practicable with the times at which the farmer's crops, if properly
cultivated, will be ready for sale.
51.       The CSFC shall lend annually to AFC and the Cooperative Bank, as
required by them for their respective lending programs under the project:
(a)  amounts of principal and interest repaid to the CSFC under the
Subsidiary Loan Agreement and;
(b)  such additional amounts as are equivalent to the proceeds of the
Credit, the Loan and the BADEA Loan withdrawn by the Government
for purposes of providing credit to farmers in accordance with
Work Plans.
CSFC's obligation in respect of the foregoing paragraph 51(a)
shall expire not earlier than three years after the last withdrawal referred
to in paragraph 51(b).



ANNEX 6

52.       Funds relent to farmers shall be utilized to provide farmers,
on average, 75% of the variable costs of planting, cultivating, harvesting and
transporting the crops in respect of which credit is sought. Not more than 25%
of the amount to be loaned will be provided in cash.
53.       The standard loan agreements utilized by AFC and cooperative unions
and societies for lending to farmers shall be acceptable to the Association.
54.       CSFC, AFC and the Cooperative Bank shall each be committed to take
such action as is required in order to enable and assist the Borrower in
meeting its obligations under the Development Credit Agreement, including, in
the case of the Cooperative Bank, ensuring adherence to the criteria set out
in paragraph 56 below in its lending to cooperative societies and unions.
55.       In respect of credit for inputs extended in kind, farmers' loan
accounts shall not be charged in amounts exceeding the market price for such
inputs in the area where the farm involved is located.
56.       The criteria for lending to farmers shall be required to include,
except as the Association shall otherwise agree:
(a) In respect of the Subsistence Farmers Credit Fund:
(i) Farmer's agricultural land holdings shall not exceed
8.5 hectares;
(ii) Farmer's net farm income for past year shall not have
exceeded K.Sh.l,000 and farmer's net income for past
year shall not have exceeded K.Sh.5,000; and
(iii) Farmer shall not have previously received substantial
agricultural credit, except under the Project.
(b) In respect of all other credit provided to farmers under the
Project (conventional credit);
(i) Farmer's agricultural land holdings shall not exceed
8.5 hectares; and
(ii) Farmer's net income for past year shall not have exceeded
K.Sh.15,000.
(c) In respect of all credit provided to farmers under the Project
for cotton, no loan shall be made unless the farmer undertakes
to cultivate at least 0.2 hectare of cotton.

KENYA
NTrCRATFTD AGRICTULTURAT D VFT_,OPMFNT PROGRAM  - PHASE T
The Cotton Industry and the Cotton Lint and Seed
Marketing Board _(CLSMB)
Background
1.        Despite its small size in relation to the total Kenyan economy,
the cotton industry is important because in the lowlands (including most of
Coast and Nyanza Provinces, and parts of Central, Eastern and Western Pro-
vinces) cotton is the longest established traditional cash crop. Under this
Project, cotton has the added importance that, because it is inedible and is
marketed through a State monopoly (i.e., the Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing
Board) it is the obvious "anchor" crop to use as security for loans to be made
to farmers.
2.        Cotton was introduced to Kenya in 1906 by a private company assisted
by the British Cotton Growers Association, but its commercial development
was so unsuccessful as compared with cotton development in neighboring Uganda
that two of the first three ginneries (in Asembo Bay, and Mtalakisi) were
dismantled and moved to Uganda. Later, with Government and private ginning
company encouragement, cotton growing was adopted by smallholders, and lint
output increased from about 17,000 bales in 1963/64 to about 30,000 bales in
1972/73. Ginnery ownership and management, however, remained in private
(largely expatriate) hands. In recent years it has become established Govern-
ment policy that, in order that farmers reap the maximum return from the
cotton industry, ginneries should be bought out by farmers' cooperatives
except for a few in special areas (e.g., irrigation schemes) which would
remain under private or statutory board ownership. In September 1975, there
were 11 ginneries in Kenya, of which 3 were owned by farmers' cooperatives, 5
by private individuals and companies, and 3 by the Cotton Lint and Seed
Marketing Board (CLSMB). Measures are being taken to transfer ownership of
all ginneries to the cooperatives as soon as possible.
3.        CLSMB is a statutory corporation established in 1955 under the
Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Act. 1/ It has wide-ranging powers for regu-
lating and servicing the cotton industry in Kenya, including for example:
power to buy and sell raw cotton, lint, and seed; prescription of cotton seed
and ginnery standards; licensing and inspection of cotton stores, markets,
ginneries and factories; treatment of cotton diseases; financing ownership
and operation of ginneries; financial technical and other assistance to cotton
growers, growers' cooperatives or ginners; and fixing of prices (with minis-
terial approval) for seed cotton, cotton lint, and cotton seed. As of
September 1975, CLSMB, in addition to providing cotton seed and insecticide on
credit to farmers through their cooperatives, owned three ginneries.
1/   The Act became effective in Nvanza and Co:ist Provinces on July 1, 1955,
and subsequently in other parts of Kenva.



ANNEX 7
Page 2
4.        Deficiencies in CLSMB operations include among others:  absence
of a strong, independent and we1l informed executive capacity; lack of continuity
in manaaement; inadequate agricultural, financial, rosting, credit, pricing
and marketing policies, and over construction ot ginneries left them operating
well below capacity.  These complaints led to the appointment of several com-
mittees of inquiry, including the Cotton Working Party of 1971, and the 11-man
Reorganization Committee which reported in June 1974. These inquiries have,
between them, recommended improvements regarding every aspect of the Boards'
activities. Although most of the recommendations were accepted by the Govern-
ment, many of them were never implemented. Thus in August 1975 Government
appointed yet another Committee of Inquiry to investigate allegations of mis-
management in the Board. As of December 1975, the General Manager and his
four most senior staff were under suspension pending the recommendations of the
Committee of Inquiry. Although Government has not released the recommendations
of this Committee, it is said to have commenced their implimentation.
5.        From discussion with members of the CLSMB, Ministry of Agriculture
staff and members of the Committee of Inquiry, there are a number of areas
of concern which ought to be addressed in a review of the Board's functions
and activities. These points are discussed below. They were discussed
during negotiations, and the most important of them were included in the
Development Credit Agreement.
Composition and the Board
6.        The composition of the Board is prescribed in Section 3(a) of the
Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Act. Representatives of the growers are
appointed by the Minister of Agriculture after consultation with the Central
Agricultural Board. Consideration might be given to the proposition that
the representatives be elected from among the growers in the main cotton
growing areas. Section 3(2)(a) of the Act specifies that representatives
should be designated also from the cotton industry. Consideration should
also be given to the appointment of persons representing different segments
of the industry, thus helping the Board to acquire a knowledge of the com-
petitive market interest of various groups. For example, those appointed
could be chosen both from among local spinners and from exporters.
Functions of the Board
7.        In view of the interest in rationalizing the functions of CLSMB
and in keeping overhead costs within reasonable limits, it might be desirable
to restrict the functions of the Board to (a) local and export sale of lint N
and seed; (b) ginnery inspection and training of gin fitters; (c) purchase of
seed cotton from the cooperative unions and of baled cotton from the ginneries,
and (d) the management and distribution of seed for planting.  These functions
would paralLel to a large extent the similar functions of the Kenva Coffee
Board.  If the functions of the Board were integrated along the lines in-
dicated above, it might then be possible t) reduce the number of headquarters
staFf (and t_) possiblv increase the number c F FielA staff)



ANNEX 7
Page 3
'3.       Mlarketing of Lint and Seed.  Consideration might be given to giving
the Chief Executive of the Board primary responsibility for the marketing of
lint and seed. Ns this is one of the most important functions of the Board,
responsibility should he charged at the highest staff level. The direct
responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day marketing operations could then
be vested in the Deputy Chief. At least one of these officers should have
practical experience of commercial marketing of primary commodities. In order
to help the officers make judgements as to the quantities of lint to be sold,
the time of sale and the price reserves to be set, the Board should subscribe
to a daily advice service which would provide up-to-date information on the
prices of equivalent types and qualities in the main cotton export markets.
9.        The Board might in the future wish to consider selling lint openly
to competing spinners and exporters, with the former given permission to
resell if they wish. Such a procedure would help to create a secondary
market within Kenya and would encourage brokers to reenter the trade. This
secondary market would be a valuable source of price information to the
Board which could assist it in making its own price determinations.
10.       The Chief Executive would benefit greatly by the recruitment of a
qualified Lint Classifier whose main function would be to establish and
maintain the FA (first grade) standlard box for each zone against which AR
(first quality) lint sales are made, as well as the UG (undergrade) box used
to determine the extent to which any sample which is the subject of a quality
claim falls below the FA standard. This Lint Classifier would be the Board's
main spokesman in discussions with claimants with regard to quality defects
(prior to resort to arbitration). As and when the crop expands - particularly
if there is any major development in irrigated cotton - the Classifier could
studv the possibility of establishing premium grades for the various zones,
which could then be the subject of separate sales against a premium standard.
II.       Ginnery Inspection and Training of Gin Fitters.  The Board should
give serious thought to employing two qualified 1/ mechanics trained in gin
fitting and maintenance.  These mechanics would be responsible for the in-
spection of ginnery operations and the correction of faults; they would also
provide on-the-job training for local fitters and mechanics employed by the
ginneries. These staff should then establish a formal inspection and train-
ing routine. Prior to the opening of the ginning season in each zone, the
inspectors would select a central ginnery and invite all local mechanics
and fitters from the ginneries in that zone to attend a training course in
gin fitting and maintenance; the group would then prepare and set up all the
equipment in the ginnery under the guidance of the inspector. For maximum
impact and in order to ensure continuity of standards, this course should
be offered annually in each zone. During the actual ginning season, the
inspectors should ideally visit each ginnery at least once a month to check
1/   The ideal recruit would be a mechanic with basic training in the rail-
way workshop in Nairobi, supplemented by specialist training in a
ginnery or overseas.



ANNEX 7

for faulty-setting and maintenance of the openers, gins, rollers and presses.
Anv faulty equipment could then be stopped and repaired under the inspector's
supervision. The inspectors would also be responsible for running tests of
the Ginning Outturn Percentage (GOP) and for reporting the results to the
Board. These tests should be carried out at least twice per season at each
ginnery. Finally, the inspectors would be charged with ensuring that no B.R.
(second quality) cotton is ginned before AR (first quality) cotton; if this
procedure is not followed much time can be lost in making the necessary adjust-
ments to the rollers and knives ruined by the BR cotton.
12.       Seed Distribution.  One of the most important responsibilities of
the Board is the treatment and distribution of new seed for planting. Parti-
cular attention should be paid to this area if yield increases are desired.
The Board should consider methods of implementing a distribution system to
transport genetically improved seed from the Kibos Experimental Station to
the growers.
Board Financial Controls and Accounting Procedures
13.       Financial Controls.  At present the Board's overhead costs are
consuming about 5%, of its gross receipts from the sale of lint and cotton.
As cotton yields are increased and Board operations streamlined, this per-
centage would be significantly reduced, thus freeing funds for other and
possibly new operations. Specifically, the Board may wish to consider the
establishment with these funds of a price assistance fund for growers; such
a fund could help protect the farmer against sudden down-turns in prices,
and on occasion it might be possible for it to pay a short crop bonus when
circumstances beyond the farmers' control have reduced the level of produc-
tion. If production can be increased in the next several years, and if world
prices continue to gradually advance in accordance with IBRD forecasts, it is
possible that a fund as large as KSh. 4.0 million could be built up over a
period of 4 to 5 years. Any decision to establish such a fund would, however,
require serious study.
14.       Accounting Procedures.  The Board should consider the recruitment
of a fully qualified Chief Accountant, along with an appropriate staff of
accountants invoice clerks and bookkeepers. The Chief Accountant would, in
addition to preparing the annual accounts and financial statements, devise a
system of controls to ensure that proper payments are made for the actual
quantities received (i.e. seed cotton by the ginneries, lint by the buyers,
and seed by the oil mills). The Gross Outturn Percentage (GOP) tests made by
the Inspectors (para 11) would provide a useful guide as to the volume of lint
and seed which should be produced by each ginnery from the seed cotton received
and paid for by the Board. Also, efforts should be made to ensure prompt
payments at all levels to help keep costs to a minimum.
Ownership of Ginneries
15.       In order to ensure that the farmers reap the maximum return from
the cotton industry, Government policy now mandates (para 2) that all privately
owned girneries be bought out by farmers' cooperatives except for a few
ginneries in special areas (e.g., irrigation schemes) which would remain under



ANNEX 7
Page 5
private or statutory board ownership. This change however, should not be read
by the cooperatives to imply that large surpluses will becone available
through these operations for transfer Lo the cooperatives. The Board should
consider means of acquainting the cooperatives with the economics of ginning,
making sure these cooperatives understand that there could be some losses if
commercial management and financial controls are inadequate. For example, the
major source of income for a ginnery in the past has been the overages 1/ in
buying, where the gins received extra quantities for whiently awarded greatly
increased buying commissions, which also contributed to a reduction in ginnery
profits. Thus between these two changes in procedure, the cooperatives are
already receiving the major financial benefits to be obtained from the indus-
try. The remaining surplus is thus unlikely to exceed KSh. 200 per bale.
Prices to Growers
16.       The Board should consider making available to growers its detailed
accounts showing the costs and returns per kilo of seed cotton. These figures
would, as is illustrated below, help to dispell the popular belief that the
Board is making a sizeable profit on its transactions. Best estimates 2/ on
current production levels were used to develop the following figures.
1/   Amounts by which the actual weight of seed cotton exceed approximate
recorded weights on which the payment formulas are based.
2/   Owing to the absence of any accounts since 1971-72 and the suspension
of the chief officers of the Board, figures of current prices and costs
are not readily available, and the figures of costs used above are to
some extent conjectural; they are for the most part based on 1973
estimates without adjustment for inflation. The figures of 37 cents
per kilogram for ginning is the initial cost allowance given to ginners
and is subject to upward adjustment at the end of the season, depending
on the actual costs of the variables in the ginning formula reported
to the Board by individual ginners. It should also be noted that the
prices obtainable for AR and BR seed are considerably lower than the
IBRD forecast for 1975, this is in part due to the fact that the Kenya
Government has imposed price controls on cotton seed oil produced by
the domestic oil millers, thus limiting the price which the latter can
offer the Board for the cotton seed. No cotton seed is exported from
Kenya.

The costs can then be compared with the estimated gross income received
by the Board.

A comparison of the two figures thus indicates a profit of only KSh 0.26/kg
seed cotton. It would seem then that the scope for increasing the return
to the grower is strictly limited unless there is a sizeable increase in
either the world price of cotton or the locally-controlled price of cotton
seed, or a permanent reduction in processing and/or handling costs, none of
which seems likely. Increased productivity through timely planting and
application of insecticides would thus seem to be the most likely avenue for
increased grower incomes. An awareness and understanding of these statistics
on the part of the growers would perhaps facilitate better relations between
the Board and the growers. In the meantime Government has agreed to set



ANNEX 7
Page ;
up the necessary machinery to ensure that a guaranteed minimum price of seed
cotton agreed with the Bank is published annually. For the 1977 season,
Government has agreed to raise the price of AR cotton seed from the K.Sh.2.00
above to K.Sh.2.50 and to adjust prices of other grades in the same proportion.
Lint Price Formula
17.       The Board, in line with a Government request, will begin a study
of possible new formulas by which ginneries could be paid for ginning services.
At the present time the Board is utilizing a revised version of the old formula
applied in neighboring Uganda, under which a ginner receives a standard first
payment for his services (KSh 0.37/kg of lint) plus a second variable payment
determined by his submisson of returns of opening and closing stocks of con-
sumable stores and actual costing of the variables involved. Thus, every gin-
nery would appear to be operating on a cost plus basis, regardless of through-
put and with no real check on variable costs. There is now considerable
support, both within the Board and in Government, for the abandonment of the
old formula and the adoption of a fixed ginning price which would only vary from
one season to another in the light of changing costs. This desire for simplic-
ity is understandable, but it is also true that unless the reimbursements are
based at least in part on costs, there is a risk of over or underpayment with
the latter posing a real threat to the viability of marginal enterprises. The
choice then appears to be between a different price level to every ginnery
based on capital employed in buildings and equipment, variable costs and through-
put (i.e. fixed and variable costs plus a fixed margin of profit) or a uniform
price to all ginners giving differing profit or loss levels and thus an in-
centive to operate to maximum economic efficiencies.
18.       Various alternative thus should be considered by the Board before
making any final decision on this point. Initially, the problem can be simpl-
ified by separating the buying from the ginning function, thus reducing the
level of variable costs. The cooperative societies and the unions might be
given exclusive collection or buying rights for seed cotton, and be paid them-
selves directly by the Board on the basis of weight notes signed jointly by the
society or the union representative and the ginnery representative. This pro-
cedure is already being followed in several areas, and would be relatively
simple to institute elsewhere. This change would then leave the separate
question of remuneration for the ginning and baling operations. Two different
approaches in this regard might be considered by the Board. One solution would
be to divide the ginneries into classes; cost analyses of both the fixed and
variable (staff) overheads could then be made and lump sum first payments
fixed for each class. Other variable costs (e.g. costs of fuel, oil, grease,
lession, twine, baling hoops, studs, etc.) could be determined by reference
to the main suppliers as of a fixed date in advance of the opening of the
ginning season; these costs plus an agreed profit could then be remitted to
the ginners as a second payment on delivery of the cotton bales. A second
solution would be that, assuming that all ginneries are owned by the cooper-
ative societies or unions, the Board could sell the bales and seed and after
a deduction of an agreed percentage to cover the costs of marketing and
management incurred by the Board, pass the proceeds back to the ginneries.
Once the ginnery costs of transport, ginning, and buying were deducted, the
remainder would be available for distribution to the members of the cooper-
atives.



ANNEX 7
Page 8
Terms and Conditions of Sale of Lint and Seed
19.       Sales.  The Board has recently instituted a public auction procedure
whereby all sales of lint and seed by the Board would be published directly
after their completion. This would assure all participants that the sales
are being carried out in a regular and impartial manner. The sales contracts
might also be revised in order to expedite the proceedings, and attention
given to the need for ensuring prompt payment by the buyer. A standard
lint and seed sales contract should be introduced which clearly stipulates
that no party shall be permitted to bid or tender for.seed or cotton lint
unless an adequate irrevocable credit has been established in the name of the
CLStIB prior to the sale. Such a contract should also define clearly the
period within which quality claims would be entertained, and should establish
the arbitration procedure to be adopted in the event of disputes.
20.       Transport.  Some economies would be achieved by the Board if all
lint and seed were sold on an ex-ginnery basis with transport paid by the
buyer. Sales of lint would best be made in 200 bale lots and should prefer-
ably be made before ginning. In this way the buyer could have an agent at
the ginnery to watch the ginning of his purchases and to'check delivery
weights (no weight claims would be admitted thereafter). This procedure
would help to ensure accuracy of weighing and recording, and would allow the
Board to pay the ginneries only for the exact weight recorded, thus reducing
the chance of over-payments. Also, owing to the inaccessibility of the area,
seed cotton from Lamu should be sold on an f.o.b. Mombasa basis.
21.       Quality and Price Controls.  All sales of AR lint cotton are pre-
sumed to be made against a standard FA (first grade) standard box (para 10),
which is renewed annually to ensure against quality erosion. Consideration
might be given to the establishment of at least one other box representing
the UG (undergrade); the differential in cents per pound to be paid for each
could be agreed annually by the Board Classifiers. This procedure could help
greatly in the arbitration of quality claims by providing a more exact standard
of comparison. Recently the Kenya Government has put a limit on the price at
which cotton seed oil may be sold, thus depressing the price tendered by the
oil millers for the cotton seed offered by the Board. With no control on the
latter price, and without detailed knowledge of the standard processing costs,
there is clearly no well-defined policy allocating the benefits of cotton seed
between the grower, the Board, the oil millers, and the consumer of the oil.
The requirement in this Project that Government would review and publish all
commodity prices annually should focus attention on this issue and lead to a
more satisfactory solution.

Requirements of the Kenya Spinning and lWeaving Industry
22.       Hitherto the volume of cotton lint allocated for sale to local
spinners and for export has been determined by the Board, with the supplement-
ary requirements of the domestic textile industry being met by the purchase
of BR lint from Uganda and Tanzania. However, the recent decline in marketed
production in these two countries has made the local industry more dependent on
local supplies. As these supplies are clearly inadequate to meet the total
potential demand, this might prove to be an auspicious time for the Board to
consider changes in its present methods of allocating the available lint.
Kenya's AR staple coton, 1-1/6" and better, is of a higher quality than re-
quired for much of the local textile production, and thus other things being
equal, it would be more economic to export the Kenya AR lint and import lower
grade and shorter staple cotton from Pakistan and India to supplement the sup-
ply of East African BR cotton. To this end it might be advisable to permit
market forces to decide how much AR cotton should be exported or retained for
local consumption by offering all lint cotton in public auction or tender to
both cotton exporters and local spinners, giving the spinners the option of
exporting their Kenya lint purchases and importing lower grade and shorter
staple cotton to suit their individual requirements.
Future Development of the Cotton Industry
23.       The Board may wish, in conjunction with the other Ministries and
Boards concerned, to consider plans for the future development of the cotton
industry. Particular attention might be given to the changing pattern of
internal demand and prices, and to export price forecasts. Due to competing
claims on the available land for the production of food crops, tobacco, sugar-
cane and sunflower, it is unlikely that there is much scope for a major
expansion in the,area of rainfed cotton. Consequently, any further develop-
ment of cotton production must if desired, be sought through irrigation.
The Board might wish to initiate a comprehensive study of the prospects of
irrigated cotton production in both cotton growing and other areas.

INTEGRATED AGRICtULTIURAT DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Integrated Agricultural Development
Soils and Climate
Soils
1.        A number of soil surveys have been done for Kenya and most of
the soils of the highland areas have been thoroughly studied and tests made
of the inputs necessary to achieve high crop yields. The regions covered
by the project are characterised as follows:
(1)  Higher altitudes.  The deep red, friable loams where the
rectification of phosphate deficiency leads to good crop
yields. For deeper rooted crops, the available soil
moisture (within the range of field capacity to wilting
point) is usually adequate to help the crop through the
two dry seasons at the beginning and mid-year periods.
However, for annual arable cropping, especially of shallow
rooted crops, the soil moisture availability may often be
critical and this is reflected in the occasional years of
low cereal yields.
(2)  Lower altitudes.  On the plateaus (about 1,300 m) below the
higher elevations, there is a range of soil types, the more
common being that with a lateritic horizon often with
impeded drainage. A second type, also found at these lower
elevations, is the so-called black cotton soil commonly
found in Nyanza, the Kano Plain and some of the coastal
shores of Lake Victoria. These soils present a number of
problems with land preparation and become difficult to
manage under very wet conditions. They have generally
low nutrient status, and available soil moisture is less
than the red soils at the higher elevations. The combi-
nation of climatic vicissitudes and not generally fertile
soils suggests that it is prudent to plan for less than
optimum yield levels at these lower altitudes.
Climate
2.        While the climate of Kenya is mainly determined by altitude,
it is also important to recognize the importance to rainfed agriculture
of the precipitation mechanism. The characteristic bimodal pattern asso-
ciated with equatorial Africa, provides two distinct rainy seasons. These
are somtimes loosely described as the long rains (essentially March through
May) and the short rains (Septerber through November).  Since these are
separated by the two driest months January and July, it is more appropriate
to consider them as the first and second rainy seasons. Fxcept for areas



ANNEX 8
Page 2
close to mountain massifs (such as Mount Kenya), the first season accounts
for about 60 percent of the annual precipitation.
3.        At the higher altitudes average rainfall exceeds 75 mm a month
for as many as 8 of the 121 months and, furthermore, the evapo-transpiration
is appreciably lower than that at lower altitudes and, as a result, perennial
crops such as tea and coffee have been successful. By contrast, for the
lower altitudes (about 4,000 ft) such as Machakos, only 5 of the months have
averages of more than 75 mms and these are interspersed with drier months.
Consequently, perennial crops are rare in these regions and even annual
arable cropping is fraught with varying levels of crop risk.
4.        For the development of an integrated crop and livestock program
for annual arable crops, it is essential to analyse such data as are avail-
able to assist the advisory staff in helping the farmer make the best use
of his given ecological zones. To illustrate the methods, data from two
stations for 16 years were examined in some detail and are shown at Tables
1 and 2. The particular choice of these was determined by the availability
of data rather than specificity to the particular regions covered by this
report.
5.        Data in the top half of Table I show the typical year to year
variation which at first sight seems to be so chaotic as to reveal no well
marked pattern. However, when these same data are arranged in rank order for
months, seasons and years (the lower half of the table), there emerges a
a readily identifiable pattern. Moreover, as the record is of actual events,
it provides a simple statement of probabililty of occurrence. For example,
at p=0.25 (that is an assurance for 3 years out of 4), February rainfall was
in excess of 31 mm, March more than 121, April more than 161, May more than
105 and June more than 45 mm. Were the monthly data statistically independent,
the chances of obtaining such a sequence would indeed be remote. Even for
p=0.50 (the medians) it can be seen that the chances of the 6 month total
at 750.5 mm (the aggregated total of medians) in fact was between p=0.25 and
0.31. Thus the 50 percent level by months provides a useful basis to consider
consumptive use of crops against expected precipitation to estimate likely
risk. Table 2 gives a similar presentation for the rather drier regions of
which eastern Meru, and Machakos may be considered typical.
6.        Table 3 gives some average rainfall data for 9 stations and
indicates not only the wide variation between regions for amount, but
also the extent to which drier months are interspersed, thus adding to
the crop risk.
Analysis to Evaluate Crop Risk
7.        Data shown at Table 4 are set out to illustrate the use to which
the precipitation probability arrangement can be usefully put. In this
particular analysis no open water surface evaporation records were avail-
able in the Ministry of Agriculture librarv, and these should be ascertained
as a matter of urgency. Nevertheless, from comparative localities, these
estimates are probably reasonable representations. Then by using well known
crop factors, it is possible to estimate tlhe separate monthly consumptive



ANNEX 8
Page 3
use for a range of annual crops in such an environment as well as pasture.
Taking a cereal crop which can clearly be planted in March, the 50% expect-
ation and consumptive use would be as follows in m.m.:
Rainfall               Consumptive
expectation                 use
March                 165                      75
April                239                      100
May                   154                     132
June                  70                       84  Deficit 14
July                  54                       60  Deficit 6
These data suggest that for p=0.50, only the months of June and July have
consumptive use in excess of expectation but the amounts of the deficit
are well within the limits of available stored soil moisture (the water
held in the soil profile between field capacity and wilting point). For
the more rigid requirement of p=0.25 (that is 3 years out of 4) there would
be significant deficits from May through July and, were maize the crop in
question, this deficit at silking could have serious effects on yield.
8.        Taking a crop of beans (or groundnuts) it will be seen that at
p=0.50, no great risk is involved since, again, the deficit for December and
January is well within the soil moisture storage.
9.         For cotton, even at p=0.50, there are deficits for 4 of the 6
months so that only rarely would optimum yields be obtained, a factor taken
into account in the later section on crop production estimates.
10.       A similar set of data are presented in Table 5 for Nanyuki and
this shows that if realized values for open water surface evaporation
are of the same order as those here estimated, most crops would suffer
deficits even at p=0.50 much less the more rigid p=0.25   Some indication
of crop risk on a seasonal basis can be obtained by comparing the consump-
tive use requirement against the actual seasonal expectation, thus evading
the difficult problem of separate monthly lack of statistical independence.
11.       For areas of which Kisumu may be typical, the 451 mm requirement
for cereals in the first half of the year has always been exceeded. But
the 464 mm requirement for beans can only be relied on about 50 percent of
the time and for cotton the 538 mm requirement during the second rainy
season can be expected only 3 years in 10 thus committing cotton to
continuous risk.
12.       In the case of the Nanyuki illustrative table, again the cereal
crop requirement is satisfied 75 percent of the time indicating a relative
failure about once in 4 years. Beans also have the even greater risk about
L times in 10 years (and may be a possible explanation as to why Mexican
heans thave not been widely acceptable to small farmers).  By contrast Irish



ANNEX 8
Page 4
Potatoes grown in the first half of the year would seem to be subject to
risk no more often than about once in five years.
13.       An important recommendation which arises from these analyses
is that, as a matter of urgency, analyses of rainfall data for each of the
locations should be subjected to these methods and appropriate crop patterns
and their risk be determined. It is also worth noting that the farmer has a
range of cultural practices which can, to some extent, alleviate the deficit
problem. For example, by widening the spacing (that is decreasing the plant
population) for cotton, the individual plant has a better chance of obtaining
its necessary water reqirement. By contrast for areas where the first rainy
season months are likely to exceed consumptive use, the highest possible plant
population (such as for maize) with associated inputs should be emphasized.
These aspects are further discussed in para. 30 below.
Crop and Livestock Production
Current levels
14.       Data from the MOA show that current crop production from the
14 project districts is derived from about 1 million hectares - mainly of
annual crops, out of a total of about 4 million ha of farm land as follows:
Cropped Area         Percent of              Percent of the
C9Hroz                ha             Cropped Area          National Cropped Area
Maize              684,000                 65                        65
Beans              272,000                 26                        84
Cotton              58,000                  6                        88
Potatoes            21,000                  2                        57
Oil Seeds           14,000                  1                        53
Miscellaneous       21,000
1,050,000
The important conclusions to be drawn from these data are:-
(1)  the dominance of the subsistence crops naize and beans which
together account for more than 90 percent of the annually
cropped area;
(2) the extent to which these 4 provinces contribute to the
National area under these crops;



ANNEX 8
Page 5
(3) that the important cotton crop (worth at present prices
about KSh. 66 million or 1JS$9.3 million annually) is mainly
produced in these Provinces;
(4)   hat of thie estimated 4.1 million ha of f.-:m la,ld reported
to be available, little more than 25 percent is cropped
annually.
With regard to livestock, it has been estimated that about 1.2 million
head of cattle are to be found in the designated Project area. Of these,
about 820,000 are in the Western and Nyanza Provinces where the Zebu type
accounts for 96 percent leaving about 4 percent of grade animals. By
contrast, the cattle population of the Eastern and Central Provinces part of
the project area is about 380,000 head, but here the grade animals con-
tribute 39 percent and reflect the considerable progress which has been
achieved in respect of improvement of smallholder livestock.
15.       According to recent estimates of population and other demographic
data the population of the 14 Districts covered is about 7.9 million with
a land area of 57.2 million, suggesting a land availability of about
7.2 hectares per capita. But such a figure must be taken with some reserve.
In the light of the contrasting environments discussed earlier in this
Annex, it is evident that cotton, for example, and potatoes do not grow
in the same environment. Furthermore the holding size varies considerably
in the climatic areas favoring high population density. Large parts of
the Central Province for example have average holding size of about 2 ha
whereas the less favored areas of the Western and Nyanza tend to have about
6 ha. Tt should also be noted that some holdings are cultivated by more
than one family. With 1.25 families cultivating the average holdings, the
available area per family is thus between 0.6 and 4.8 ha.
16.       For convenience, the Project area has been divided into two
approximately equal zones: the higher and the lower zones. Only maize,
beans and livestock are common to both. But because of holdng size limita-
tions, the livestock management procedures tend to differ. At the higher
elevations, zero grazing is being encouraged whereas the lower elevations
with larger holdings tend to be more extensively managed.
17.       The high zone covers Kisii, Kakamega, Bungoma, Nyeri, Kiambu and
parts of Embu and Machakos. The low zone includes Kisumu, Siaya, South
Nyanza, Busia, Meru, Kirinyaga.
18.       On the basis of 56,000 holdings to be improved and average
area under crops and livestock, the following illustrative patterns
emerge:-

Total                        2.57                3.40
19.       The aggregated project area would be about 71,000 ha in the high
zone and nearly 94,000 ha in the low zone making a total of 165,000 ha which
reflects an average holding size of about 3 ha or 2.4 ha per family.
20.       The smaller annually cropped area of the high zone is often only
part of the source of family income in that this area is suited to coffee,
pyrethrum and tea. The first of these provides a convenient "security" or
"anchor" cash crop against which credit can be obtained. Mention has also
been made of land limitation for providing livestock fodder.
21.       The limitations imposed by the environment on the low zone are that,
with the possible exception of cotton, there is no convenient security crop
against which credit facilities can readily be organized. In view of the
climatic constraints, and the level of inputs necessary to achieve acceptable
average yields, there is understandably some reluctance on the part of the
grower to increase his area under cotton. But at present no equally popular
alternative anchor crop appears to be available even though some farmers grow
sunflower, and groundnuts could also be grown. There does, however, appear
to be a reasonably good prospect for expanding livestock production provided
that disease control and marketing facilities are greatly improved. The
former is of considerable importance at these lower altitudes where a wider
range of debilitating and lethal diseases occur than at the higher zone.
Project Development Proposals
22.       So far as the actual cropped area is concerned, the Project
proposals are based on the following assumptions:



ANNEX 8
Page 7
(i) The first Project year (1976/77) would be a year of
preparation, during which key staff would be hired, and
the adminstrative arrangements for the Project set up.
Thereafter, the 56,000 holdings (70,000 farmers) constituting
about 20% of all the holdings in the Project area would be
brought within the Project at the rate of 20% in 1977-78, 25%
in 1978/79, 25% in 1979/80 and 30% in 1980/81.
(ii) The participating farmers under the Project would be offered
la package under an improved extension service, and improved
credit arrangements for:-
(a) input supplies;
(b) creation of new or improvement of existing marketing
facilities;
(c) seasonal and medium term credit;
(d) training of and demonstration by farmers;
(e) credit or other facilities for land preparation;
(f) cattle health and productivity services.
23.       While it is true that maize yields, using hybrid seed and timely
application of inputs, can easily exceed 30 bags (2.7m ton/ha), it is unlikely
that, even given the closest attention by extension personnel, the time
horizon would be less than 4 years. Consequently, it is considered prudent to
graduate the yield improvement as well as the physical input package. This
means that with an annually increasing number of participating farmers, the
full benefits are not expected until year 8. For the lower altitudes also, an
attempt has been made to allow for a relative crop failure about once in 4
years for cereals. Thus, instead of averaging 2.7m ton/ha as for the higher
elevations, the projected yield at full development is only 2.3m ton. Similar
principles have been employed for other crops and livestock production where
the basic principle of one cow per farmer has been followed. The phasing of
yield levels for the high and low zones is summarized in Annex 14, Table
3.
Project Production Projections
24.       Annual incremental production resulting from the Project is detailed
in Annex 14 for the individual farmer and Annex 16 for the whole Project.
The average net holding income without the project has been estimated by
the appraisal mission to be about KSH 980/ - which corresponds to a family
income of some KSH 784/- (US$97) or US$19 per capita 1/. This compares with
the IBRD estimated poverty level income for Kenya of US$78. The low zone
farmer, with a per holding income of 757/-, and per family income of 606/-
(US$75) or US$15 per capita earns only 19% of the Kenyan poverty level income.
1/ Ignoring non-agricultural incomes and income transfers.



ANNEX 8
Page 8
Even the high zone farmer with a per holding income of 1204/- earns only 963/-
(US$119) or US$24 per capita which is still only 31% of the Kenya poverty
level. At full development the typical low zone farmer would be earning 846/-
(USS105) or US$21 per capita and the typical high zone farmer 1,490/- (US$185)
or US$37 per capita.l/
25.       The cost of inputs on which these Project proposals were based
are set out at Annex 14, Tables 1, 2 and 4. These show that even without
the Project the farm input costs are considerable. In order to achieve the
target yields set out earlier, there will be considerable increases in
these costs, accounting for as much as 67 percent of the Gross Production
Value for the high zone and nearly 77 percent for the low zone. It must
also be emphasised that institutional support, especially for the timely
provision of inputs, is essential for the realisation of the yield levels
discussed in this Annex.
Land Preparation and Mechanisation
26.       Considerable emphasis was laid in the Kenya Government's original
proposals on the shortage of labor for land preparation at periods of peak
demand. In principle, when much of the annual crop production was based
on virtual monoculture on maize or coffee, this contention would be correct.
It is also true that in certain regions, timeliness of sowing can be a very
critical factor in obtaining satisfactory yields. Preparation of a rela-
tively large area by a single farmer would therefore be fruitless under
such conditions. The fact that casual labor is employed suggests an aware-
ness by farmers who would appear to employ each other at appropriate periods.
Also in the context of smallholder agriculture, where the farmers tend to
spread their risks by a series of crop sowings, the bunching of labor peaks
is less evident. For the two zones discussed in this Annex, the high zone
would be expected to have labor demands in March for cereals and potatoes,
and again in September. These would be followed by harvesting support in June
and July and again in January. However, it might well be argued that land
preparation for an aggregate average area of 1 hectare might need some assis-
tance. A survey of some farmers in the field indicated the that this land
preparation could be carried out by hand work of casual labor, were credit
facilities available. This does not mean that for the larger holdings some
form of mechanisation is not desirable but rather that such mechanisation is
not for the small scale farmers for whose benefit this Project is intended.
27.       The input costs shown in Annex 14 reflect the need for casual
labor on the one hand as well as under the category of ploughing (for which
hand cultivation can be substituted). Thus in the case of maize the KSh. 185
for ploughing effectively represents 37 man days per hectare and the separate
category of KSh. 225 a further 45 man days, the remainder being supplied by
the farm family. As and when a real labor shortage develops it would seem
appropriate to consider support for an entrepreneurial contract tractor hire
system which would be financially competitive with costs associated with hand
cultivation.

Research
28.       Mention has previously been made of the orientation of research
to large scale agriculture, be it coffee, tea or even maize, for each of
which Research Stations of international repute have long been established
in Kenya. The application of their findings has been successful on this
large scale where availability of inputs through commercially available
credit has not presented serious problems. But the translation of some of
these now well known principles to smallholder agriculture is relatively
recent and the coverage on a very small scale.
29.       In view of the self-evident and urgent need to improve farm
family income, the mission had perforce to make judgements on the minimum
input package to achieve what are shown to be realistic yield levels. As
an interim measure this is satisfactory so long as the complex of insti-
tutional support can be made to function. But there are a number of
problems which must simultaneously be studied during the execution of the
Project.
30.       The first of these concerns a well planned survey of the exist-
ing pattern of agriculture for the two zones, especially taking account
of the farmers' constraints whether real or imagined. An immediate outcome
would be the feed back for experiment stations, rather than research stations,
to provide solutions. It is in this important aspect that the Evaluation
Unit (Annex 9) would play an important role. Furthermore, the practical
demonstration of effective solutions would need to be made at the Farmer
Training Centers (FTC) discussed in Annex 3.
31.       At a somewhat academic level, there is also a need to estimate
the crop water requirements of various crops in relation to rainfall expec-
tation in order to estimate farmers risk in relation to the costs of inputs.
Means of amelioration through, for example, a more imaginative manipulation
of plant populations for specific localities, might well be re-examined.
It is after all, unlikely that a successful statistically correct experiment
with maize in a favorable ecological zone would be equally applicable in
a zone where rainfall expectation is frequently less than consumptive use
by the crop. Even the correct balance between nitrogenous and phosphate
fertilizers under such varied rainfall conditions might well be re-examined,
especially as it is now proposed to have at least one FTC for each of the
districts.
32.       Since cotton is likely to play an important role in the low zone
it is suggested that immediate steps be taken to devise a proper system
of seed multiplication to take advantage of breeding improvements effected,
for example, at Kibos. Starting wit:h the need for between 1200 to 1500 tons
of tested cotton seed with proven germination capacity, this would be derived
from an area producing 1850 to 2300 m tons of seed cotton. In fact, this
is well within the capacity of the Htwea Ginnery. If an isolation area of
say 2500 ha, under irrigation, were available at an average vield of 900
kg per ha. production would be 2250 tons of seed cotton. When ginned, acid
delinted, and dressed with fungicide, this should produce about 1350 tons of
high quality seed. In turn this could be packaged and distributed through
existing channcls of the Kenya Seed Co.



ANNEX 8
Page 10
33.       Planting of the 2500 hectare isolation area at 20 kg per ha would
require 50 tons of seed which, if produced under rainfed conditions at 650
kg/ha seed cotton, would require a separate isolation area of about 100
hectares. Since there are to be farmer training centers for each of the 14
districts, and each of these would have commercially oriented farming, the
approximately 7 serving the cotton based region would need to plant no
more than 15 hectares, each obtaining the seed from Kibos. Attention to
this important requirement is also mentioned in Annex 7 under proposals
for improving the operation of the Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Board.

KENYA
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Monitoring and Evaluation
1.        There are two main sets of objectives in establishing the monitor-
ing and evaluation system in the Project. The first is to generate reliable
statistical information on some of the basic indicators of the existing
agricultural base and of agricultural performance in subsequent years in
the Project area and to develop the institutional capability required to
carry out this task. Information on yields, cropping patterns and acreages,
is at present inadequate, making it difficult, except in a very general way,
to assess the average base line income, the variability around it and its
relationship to the existing cropping patterns.
2.        Lack of reliable data is partly the result of the limited institu-
tional capability for data collection in Kenya. Due to shortage of trained
staff the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) has not collected much agricul-
tural production statistics in the past. Although CBS has begun to expand
the scope of its data collection activities including a socio-economic survey
that is now underway, it is unlikely to be able to cope with the specific
monitoring needs of this Project. It is proposed, therefore, that for the
Project area this function should be carried out in liaison with the CBS
by the evaluation officer in the Land and Farm Management Division, to be
appointed under the Project. Further, it is proposed that the evaluation
officer have the necessary support staff in the form of one assistant at the
head office and one enumerator in each of the districts. The latter would be
responsible for data collection on a fulltime basis in the Project areas in
the districts. The preliminary work related to setting up a data collection
system including defining sampling procedures and pretesting of surveys would
be carried out with the help of a statistical expert to be provided under the
Project on a consultancy basis. In addition, the Project provides for compu-
tational and programming costs of processing and analyzing these data on a
regular basis to assess Project performance.
3.        The second set of objectives in monitoring and evaluation of the
Project would be to assess periodically the managerial effectiveness of the
Project including (a) effectiveness of individual delivery systems such as
extension, credit and input distribution and output marketing; (b) effecti-
veness of coordination among the various services; and (c) the employment,
foreign exchange and other macro-economic effects of the Project. The plan-
ning division of the Ministry of Agriculture, or a unit within CBS, would
have the responsibility to carry out the assessment of these broader benefits
of institutional development expected to accrue under the Project. The
assessment would involve undertaking a number of ad hoc studies periodically
to judge effectiveness of specific interventions. On the basis of such assess-
ments the planning division would make recommendations as to the steps, if
any, that may be necessary for improved implementation of agricultural
serviccrs. This anialysis and the statistics to be collected and analysed by

the Farm Management Division would be important in the preparation of sub-
sequent phases of the program. It is assumed that the technical assistance
pool from which the manpower would be drawn for reinforcing the planning
division, will provide the necessary skills for evaluation of the Project. It
must be emphasized, however, that the progress on hiring new expatriate and
local staff for the planning division so far has been very limited. Steps
will have to be taken to accelerate this program if manpower is to be avail-
able in time for project monitoring. Alternatively, it has been suggested
that the CBS or a specialist evaluation unit if one is established within the
Ministry of Finance and Planning should carry out this wider evaluation
function as part of an evaluation covering all projects in all sectors of
the economy. Concomittantly, it is recommended that whenever necessary the
staff of the Institute of Development Studies and the University of Nairobi
that have gained experience from the evaluation of the Special Rural Develop-
ment Program be called upon to provide the necessary input in monitoring and
evaluation, particularly since some of the studies would be ad hoc and,
therefore, could be contracted out. These suggestions have been accepted in
principle by the Ministry of Agriculture.

ANNEX 13
Page" 1
KENYA
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Marketing and Prices
1.        Kenya imports large quantities of certain agricultural products,
such as cotton lint and vegetable oil, because domestic production falls far
short of demand. Furthermore there is likely to remain a strong demand
for such commodities for many years to come. This point is illustrated by
the fact that during 1973 to 1975, the price of sunflower seed more than
doubled and that of castor seed and groundnut nearly doubled. Although Kenya
has been an exporter of maize, pulses, meat, milk and some types of cotton,
due to the high population and income growth the domestic demand for these
cmmodities has also been increasing quite rapidly. Domestic marketing pro-
b;ems have arisen partly from failure in the past to fully exploit scarce
commodities, and partly from certain inefficient licensing, organizational and
other practices of marketing institutions. This is where the major scope
for improvement lies.
2.        At present, farm products are marketed through a series of statutory
boards, national and local cooperatives and private industry. Maize, beans,
oilseeds and many other minor crops are marketed by the Maize and Produce
Board (MPB), cotton by the Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Board (CLSMB), milk
by Kenya Cooperative Creameries (KCC), meat by Kenya Meat Corporation (KMC),
passion fruit and potatoes by private traders as well as the Horticultural
Crops Development Authority (HCDA).
Maize and Board
3,        The Maize and Produce Board is a statutory board created by the
"Marketing and Agricultural Produce Act" and the "Maize Produce Act". During
1973/74 it marketed over 38 varieties of produce including maize, several
types of beans, oilseeds, millet and a few other minor crops.- It is vested
with "monopoly" powers for marketing these commodities in the sense that all
movements exceeding 2 bags of maize across district boundaries or exceeding 10
bags within district boundaries must be marketed through an agent of MPB.
Even then, on average it handles less than 15 percent of the total maize
crop.
4.        As of June 1975, MPB had 38 depots for storing grain at various loca-
tions in Kenya and made use of about-3,800 agents for buying and selling the
grain. Nevertheless,.a farmer is allowed to deliver his crop directly to MPB
if he so desires. The margin allowed for the traders is fixed by MPB. Allow-
ance for transportation cost of the grain is included in the margins. The
price paid by MPB to the trader does not vary with seasons or from one geo-
graphical area to another. MPB depots accept maize only if the moisture
content is less than 13 percent.



ANNEX 13
Page 2
5.         Partly due to the increase of price from KSh 50 to 65 in the 1974/
1975 season, the amount of maize delivered to MPB during 1974/1975 was 5 mil-
lion tons, i.e. 1 1/2 million tons higher than the amount in the previous year.
Of the activities being promoted under the Project, prices of maize, meat and
milk are controlled for the portion that is marketed through organized chan-
nels. Prices of other crops depend on market conditions. The Kenyan agri-
cultural marketing system was originally designed to serve large scale farmers.
Its emphasis has changed only slightly in recent years. Marketing of maize
and pulses illustrates this point. Of the 3.7 million bags of maize purchased
by MPB in 1973-1974, 2 million bags were purchased in the Rift Valley Province
alone and another 1.4 million in the Western province. For a variety of rea-
sons, in the past the MPB has not been geared to serving the needs of the sub-
sistence farmer whose marketed surpluses are small, fluctuating and, therefore,
often highly unpredictable. Most such surpluses have been sold through tra-
ditional m.arket channels and consumed in rural areas. However, the effective
functioning of this traditional sector has been inhibi'ted by the marketing and
price policies and by the nature of MPB's operations. As a result, apart from
inadequate extension and untimely input supply, fragmented markets and conse-
quent lack of price incentives have been major bottlenecks to increasing the
productivity and production of the traditional subsistence crops.
6.         Five aspects of MPB policies and organization are particularly
inimical to efficient commodity marketing. First, the MPB is poorly equipped
to assess the size of nearly four-fifths of the maize production in the
traditional sector. The same situation holds in the case of pulses and oil-
seeds. The market intelligence available to MPB needs to be improved not only
to ease MPB's operations but also because a more active role for MPB in this
traditional market is essential to provide the price incentives necessary to
stimulate production in the subsistence sector.  The Project aims to correct
this situation partially by initiating a system of agricultural data collec-
tion in the areas selected for the project.
7.         Second, although the Maize and Produce Board has a number of agents
who purchase produce on behalf of the Board, there are too few of these agents
in some areas to provide a marketing outlet within easy reach of most farmers.
In such cases statutory purchase prices have not been effective floor prices,
particularly because pockets of surpluses have led to temporary decline in
prices in the post harvest period in such surplus areas. The inadequacy of
purchasing agents can, of course, be corrected easily by increasing the number
of agents nominated, since the Board incurs no cost in so doing. The MPB
needs to correct this situation if it is to carry out a more vigorous pur-
chasing policy in smallholder surplus areas in the future.
8.         Third, the small quantities of the total maize and pulses purchased
by the Board, has, partially, been a result of the low support price for
maize until 1975, when the statutory maize price was revised from KSh 50 to
KSh 65 per bag of 90 kgs. Prior to the price revision, given the fragmented



ANNEX 13
Page 3
market structure, in chronically deficit areas it was more profitable for
small'farmers to sell their produce in the open market. In these areas
at times, prices were as much as 100 percent higher than the statutory prices
even in the peak marketing season.  For the Board to be an effective imple-
menting agency of the price policy, it is essential that the prices of sub-
sistence crops be under review on a regular basis and,that they be revised as
appropriate with changing long term market conditions, with particular regard
to relative prices.  Such a pricing policy and reorientation of the scope of
MPB's operations are both crucial if surpluses of maize and other crops
anticipated under the Project are to be realized. Government has agreed to
undertake such price review annually and assurances were obtained during
negotiations regarding that undertaking, as well as setting up the necessary
administrative machinery to formulate and to implement the policy.
9.        Fourth, a related feature of the MPB has been its orientation
to urban (e.g. Naitobi and Mombassa) and export markets. The urban sales
and exports need to be distinguished from equalization of supplies throughout
the country, including those rural areas that are chronically deficit in
cereals. Apart from its desirability on welfare grounds expansion of MPB's
distribution to cover rural areas will allow it more easily than before to
dispose of the stocks acquired through a vigorous program of purchases. To
some extent, the poor crop years of 1972 and 1973-74 and the shortages they
created in areas that are usually self sufficient has already led to a greater
effort in rural distribution by the MPB. The policy of maintaining a strategic
reserve of maize also reflects this change of direction. The Project would
facilitate this action through increase in the storage and drying facilities
to be made available to the MPB in producing areas. These areas are more
easily. accessible to rural distribution points. It would also provide more
staff to MPB to facilitate its purchase and distribution functions.
10.       Fifth, the restrictions on interdistrict movements of maize and
produce on private account exacerbate the problem of regional inequities
and price disparities.. Although licensing of movement is within the juris-
diction of the MPB, partly due to inadequate market intelligence, in the
past the MPB has been unable to facilitate the free flow of surpluses on
private account from surplus to deficit regions. Severe restrictions on
movement of grain have seemed justifiable in the past because there have been
frequent shortages in domestic supplies. With increased surpluses under the
Project, the MPB would have to play a different role, namely one of facili-
tating such interdistrict movements on private account through more liberal
issuance of licenses, so as to provide the necessary price incentive for
production.
11.       In addition to equalizing prices between regions, 'this policy would
also have the desirable effect of leaving the marketing of maize and produce
largely in the traditional sector, which already handles a major portion of
the marketed surplus and which, from all available evidence, incurs marketing
costs that are far smarler than those incurred by the MPB.



ANNEX 13
Page 4
12.       In summary the MPB's more appropriate role should be the one of
stabilizing prices, equalizing distribution and providing a price incentive
as distinct from the one of a major monopoly exporter and the administrator
of movement restrictions, the functions it has been performing over the
years.
13.       In comparison with maize and cotton, the role of statutory Boards
in marketing is expected to be much less important in the case of other
products in the first phase of the project. Nevertheless, even in the case
of these commodities, price policies and development of marketing institutions
will have to receive more attention in the future if Kenya's agricultural
production is to be increased significantly. The discussion below illus-
trates this point.
14.       The Kenya Meat Commission, a statutory body, handles the processing
of ffieat and has monopoly over beef exports at statutory prices. However,
much of the meat produced in the traditional sector does riot find its way
into the organized channel. It is sold in the domestic market through
traditional channels, firstly, because the domestic demand for meat products
has been high and growing rapidly and the prices offered by traditional
butchers have been frequently higher than the statutory prices offered by
the KMC. Secondly, the cattle in the traditional sector often do not meet
export quality requirements. Thirdly, KMC's marketing channels are not
geared to tapping suppliers in the traditional sector. Despite these
limitations of the organized market, because there is unfulfilled domestic
demand and a relatively low rate of growth of the domestic production, the
disposal of the cattle production is not expected to pose any serious
difficulties in this project. For the longer run, the pricing of meat
must, be reviewed in conjunction with that of grains and dairy products.
15.       Crops such as potatoes and milk are also expected to enjoy rising
domestic demand. However, the perishability of these products may pose
marketing problems if marketing channels including, in particular, coopera-
tive organizations do not handle their surpluses effectively. A major
portion of the marketed surplus of potatoes reaches the urban consumer through
the traditional market channels. The studies of th potato market conducted
by the Horticultural Crops Development Authority (HCDA) indicate that' the
private marketing system is reasonably'competitive and that the spread between
the farm level and the urban prices of potatoes is usually small. However,
there are substantial seasonal variations in prices. Further, even a slight
glut in farm level markets leads to a'substantial price decline. If potato
production increases significantly, such seasonal variation may, of course,
be exacerbated. Alternatively the low seasonal prices may inhibit produc-
tion. The cold storage proposed under the Project will alleviate the problem
of seasonal variability somewhat. However, there is also considerable scope
for expanding the role of the cooperatives to include marketing of potatoes.
This will provide an alternative to the private trading channels, thus
increasing competition and reducing seasonal variability.
16.       In the case of milk the Kenya Cooperative Creameries (KCC) already
handles all of the exports and a substantial portion of the milk consumed in
large urban centers. Nevertheless, most of the milk procured by the KCC
comes from the large farmers in the Rift Valley and from the smallholder



ANNEX 13
Page 5
commercial farmers in the Eastern and Central province where dairy cattle has
performed well and milk coopertives are relatively well organized. However,
even in parts of Central Province there are allegations that large quantities
of milk are wasted due to the poorly organized cooperative milk marketing
system; that farmers receive a small fraction of the retail price; that there
is mismanagement of funds, and that the management of cooperative organizations
will benefit from further training and greater insistence on public account-
ability. Milk cooperatives are even less adequate in Westen and Nyanza
provinces. Because milk surpluses have not been significant in this area,
absence of marketing channels has not posed a major problem in the past.
Even after implementation of the Project commences, the initial low volumes
of marketed surpluses are likely to be absorbed in the rural sector through
informal marketing channels. As all Project Cooperatives are expected to be
multi-purpose, they would have to market milk as well as other farm produce.
However, it is essential that marketing prospects for milk and potatoes be
watched continuously and efforts be made to assure necessary facilities suffi-
ciently in advance to avoid marketing bottlenecks. The Project's provisions
for strengthening the cooperative management should also help alleviate the
problem of high market margins and poor price incentives faced by farmers.
17.       Until the development of processing plants in Kenya during the
last two years, edible oil demand was met by imports. Most locally produced
oilseed was exported. More recently some supplies of oilseeds have been
imported from neighboring countries for processing or reexportation. Most
of the institutionalized buying of oilseed has historically been by the
.MPB and the Kenya Farmers Association. More recently, processors have been
buying directly from the farmers. Kenya's crushing industry has traditionally
been restricted to processing cotton seed and copra. With the recent construc-
tion of the factories in Nakuru, processing has extended to include sunflower
and maize germ. In 1975 the total processing capacity was approximately
45,000 tons of seed per annum. Addition{al capacity developed since 1972
totals approximately 20,000 tons of oilseeds and is expandable to 30,000
tons p.a. depending on the availability of raw materials and the demand.
The development of these crops under the project, therefore, assures a supply
for the processing facilities and will help raise their operational efficiency.
18.       The Horticultural Crops Development Authority (HCDA) is the statutory
body that controls the marketing of passion fruit in the overseas markets
through the issuing of export licenses and, in cooperation with the Ministry
of Agriculture, promotes the development of passion fruit growing in addition
to other fruits and vegetables. Passion fruit juice is the major outlet for
this crop and consequently is a growth area for the industry. Most of the
juice is exported, and Kenya Fruit Producers Ltd. (KFP) is the major producer
of concentrate and single strength juice. Domestically, passion fruit is
principally consumed fresh, with juice consumption increasing in recent years
under the influence of the new factory and market promotion by the HCDA who
are undertaking sales campaigns to exploit the market potential, especially
for exports. Passion fruit is exported fresh and as juice. At present Kenya
is one of the major world exporters of these products. However, it has
suffered from lack of a systematic strategy to maintain and expand overseas



ANNEX 13
Page 6
markets. One constraint to increased deliveries of passion fruit by farmers
to processors has been the price paid by KFP compared to the price offered
at the local markets and for fresh exports. In 1974 the KFP price was
33 cents and the KFP has managed to increase the price for 1975 to 45
cents. During the years in which KFP paid low prices, there was a tendency
for passion fruit to be replaced by other more profitable enterprises, and
some growers have been selling all their fruit to the fresh fruit exporters,
thus exaggerating the deficiency in supply to KFP. A further rise to 50
cents per kg sprayed fruit for the 1975 crop is anticipated as part of the
program to realize the target increase in production.
The New Role of Cooperatives in Collection,
Storage and Transportation of Primary Output
19.       The "cotton cooperatives" 1/ have so far been acting as agents
for the Cotton Lint and Seed Marketing Board (CLSMB) in purchasing seed
cotton. With the new development the tasks for the unions would be extended
and they would also have to take on responsibilities for food crops purchas-
ing, storage and transportation. Information about the crop buying capacity
of cooperative societies can generally only be obtained through specific
enquiry at those societies and was in fact obtained with regard to the few
societies visited during appraisal follow-up. The information obtained
leads to the conclusions discussed below.
20.       There seems to be a general lack of transportation capacity in
the unions and probably not enough buying centers. If the unions are to
collect food crops successfully one should aim at a network of centers
within fairly easy reach of the farmers, say 10-15 kilometers.
21.       The cooperatives would continue to buy cotton on behalf of the
Cotton Board and would deliver to the (probably union owned and operated)
ginneries in accordance with present practice. Assurances are being sought
under the project that all farmers in the project area would market seed
cotton through their cooperative societies.
22.       The cooperatives should also be appointed as buying agents for the
Maize and Produce Board for the food crops and would buy and deliver to the
Board at fixed prices. The cooperatives -hould, however, also strive to
establish contracts with processing industry for better prices (groundnuts,
sunflower seed, etc.).
23        The societies and unions would own and operate their own buying
centers and should probably take over those centers owned by the Cotton
Board, as these would now be used not only for cotton but also for other
crops.
1/   Cooperative societies and unions set up specifically to cater for
cotton growers. Under the Project such societies and unions would
handle all crops, as well as milk and meat.



ANNEX 13
Page 7
24.       The cooperatives will have to become more,competitive in their
operations if they are to obtain any share of the marketed food crops.
Private traders usually pay higher than official prices for these crops,
except at the beginning of the selling season, just after harvest. The
cooperatives will probably be able to compete successfully at this time;
but will have to.maintain adequate service (opening hours, etc.) and pay
cash in order to obtain the farmers' confidence. Many instances of neglect
with regard to the service of cooperatives were reported.
25.       It is necessary to create a good buying network if the food crops
are to be made cash crops and there will probably be no need for second
payments as prices for these crops could be fixed at the beginning of the
season.
26.       Also for food crops it is necessary that the new MT accounting
system is operational before cooperatives enter into any more extensive
buying. This system would then facilitate controls in buying and shipments
and losses in transportation and storage will be avoided. These aspects of
cooperative crop matketing are adequately reflected either in the proposed
Work Plans or in assurances Qbtained during negotiations.

INTEGRATED AGRICULTUR. Lt DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Farm Budgets
1.        Tables 1 and 2 of this Annex show the projected cash flow state-
ments for two typical Project farmers, one in the high zone and the other
in the low zone with and without the Project. While these farm budgets
do not represent all the various conditions in the proposed Project area,
they illustrate Project expectations with regard to most of the proposed
beneficiaries. Annex 16, Tables 1 to 5, detail aggregate production farm
costs and benefits, with and without the Project. Tables 3 and 4 of this
Annex show the yield assumptions, input and labor costs on which the farm
budgets and aggregate costs and benefits are based, and Annex 8 describes the
agricultural background to the proposed Project activities.
2.        Yields are particularly difficult to forecast in this Project
because development in each district will vary according to the District
Work Plans, and because of the wide variety of geographical areas and insti-
tutions encompassed by the Project. Yields would be generally greater for
farmers in the higher (usually rainier) zone than for those in the low zone.
Yield estimates are averages taking into account the likelihood of drought
in one year out of four. Yields would thus be higher than these averages
in good years and lower in bad. For the typical farmer, yields are expected
to increase cumulatively until reaching the projected maxima in the fourth
harvest following the farmers' first introduction to Project services. For
the typical high altitude farmer cultivating 2.5 ha, yields are expected to
improve over four years as follows: maize from 1 ton/ha to 2.7 ton/ha;
beans from 0.54 ton/ha to 1.1 ton/ha; potatoes from 5 ton/ha to 18 ton/ha;
passion fruit from 5 ton/ha to 15 ton/ha; milk from 1,100 litres to 1,700
litres per cow, and beef from 100 to 130 kg/ha. For the lowland farmer
typically cultivating about 3.4 ha, yields are expected to increase over
four years as follows: maize from 0.8 ton/ha to 2.3 ton/ha; beans from
0.54 ton/ha to 1.1 ton/ha; cotton from 0.23 ton/ha to 0.65 ton/ha, ground-
nuts (in shell) from 0.60 ton/ha to 1.2 ton/ha; milk from 1,000 litres to
1,600 litres per cow, and beef from 100 to 130 kg/ha. Smallholders in Kenya
have, under similar conditions, with average levels of husbandry, obtained
yields comparable to the above maxima. The four-year build up period
assumed is to enable farmers to become accustomed to the Project's inno-
vations and systems.
Costs
3.        Table 4 shows that, even without the Project, farmers were spending
appreciable sums of money, not only on physical inputs, but also on hired
labour. Furthermore, there was no institutional credit to finance such



ANNEX 14
Page 2
purchases. With the Project, the high zone exenditure per holding on
physical inputs (fertilizers seed, insecticides, cattle feed and hanging
frame for passion fruit) would increase from KSh 476 to KSh 1951 (310%).
This increase would be phased as to 104% in Year 1, 70% in Year 2, and
136% in Year 3. In the low zone, expenditure on physical inputs would be
increased from KSh 482 to KSh 1579 (227%) in stages of 63% in Year 1, 54%
in Year 2 and 110% in Year 4. These stages of increase are designed to
minimize the risk of losses while both the farmer and the institutions are
being introduced to the services, innovations and organizational demands of
the Project.
Labour
4.        At first sight the projections of hired labour with the Project
appear very high at 228 adult man-days (KSh 1140 at KSh 5 per man-day) in
the high zone, and 318 man-days (KSh 1590 - KSh 5 per man-day) in the low
zone. In theory, 1-1/4 families with 1-1/2 adults working a five day week
should be able to provide all the needed labor, since they can work 487
man-days. However, such calculations over smplify the problem by ignoring the
incidence of sharp peaks and deep troughs in the real monthly distribution of
labour demand for the crops and in the areas proposed for the Project. With
land preparation by hand tools as assumed in this Project, the sharpest
labour demand peak would be during land preparation; with lower peaks during
the planting (mainly due to application of fertilizers) and harvesting. On
the other hand, family labour would be considerably under-employed during
the rest of the year, but the seasonality of labour demand peaks makes it
difficult to substitute this family labour for the hired labour. Several
indications support this view, viz. (1) casual labor appears in all farm
budget costings thus showing that farmers either employ each other or that
people are available (in practice, both these factors are at work). (2) Even
without the Project, the average Project holding was already hiring 96 man-days
a year. (3) The farmers indulge in sequential planting, often recognizing
that this does result in some loss of yield but which at the same time spreads
their risk. (4) With the tropical heat, physically exhausting land preparation
with a hand hoe, heavy emphasis on school attendance by children, and social
health and other demands of a typical African rural life, it is widely esti-
mated by agricultural officials in Kenya that the most labour one can expect
from a typical 5-member Kenyan farm family is about 25 man-days a month.
Until such time as the yield improvements begin to show, and that the credit-
worthiness improves to the stage that support would be accorded an entrepre-
neurial tractor hire system, there seems to be limited scope for tractor
ploughing services which would replace the current heavy investment in hired
labour for land preparation.
Benefits
5.        A farm holding of 2.5 ha in the high zone is currently estimated
to provide an income of KSh 1,204 (US$150) and this is expected to increase
to KSh 1,862 (US$231) with the Project. In the low zone the current income
is estimated KSh 757 (US$94) and this is expected to increase to KSh 1,058
(US$131). It must be pointed out, however, that since a holding is on
average owned by 1-1/4 families, the respective incomes per farm family
become:



ANNEX 14
Page 3
High zone    Without the Project  US$120   With the Project   US$185
(US$24 per capita)              (US$37 per capita)
Low zone     Without the Project  US$75    With the Project   US$105
(US$15 per capita)              (US$21 per capita)
Two significant conclusions which emerge from these figures are that, firstly,
with the poverty level in Kenya estimated by IBRD at US$78, the typical
Project farmer in both the high and low zones is at an income level well
below the poverty line. The Project is therefore addressing the needs of the
poorer farmers. Secondly, the income of the typical Project farmer is so far
below the indicated poverty level, that, even with the 40% to 55% increase in
income to be derived from the Project, his income would still be well below
the poverty level. All the above comparisons, however, disregard incomes from
non-agricultural sources, as well as income transfers. This may partly
account for the large gap between Project per capita farm incomes and the
poverty income level.

ANNEX 16
Page 1
KENYA
INTEGRATED AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
Economic Analysis
1.        Project incremental costs and benefits are summarized in Table 1.
These are expressed in constant value terms (base = 1975 prices) and are
based on Project cost data in Annex LO and the crop production and input use
data described in Annex 14.
2.        In the calculation of economic costs and benefits foreign exchange
has been shadow-priced at a rate of US$1=KSh 9.30 to reflect the economic cost
of foreign exchange to Kenya. Prices used for maize, groundnuts, cotton and
beef are based on export parity since Kenya is expected to be a net exporter
of these commodities during the Project period. For beans, passion fruit,
potatoes and milk, which are not traded internationally in Kenya, actual farm
gate prices have been used. Yearly prices for farm commodities and fertilizers
have been projected on the basis of the World Bank's commodity price forecast
until 1985/86; thereafter, prices have been assumed to remain at 1985/86 levels.
Input prices other than for fertilizer have been assumed to remain constant at
1975 levels. Commodity prices are shown in Tables 2 and 3, and fertilizer prices
in Table 4.
3.        The Project would increase crop yields per hectare and production
per animal unit, but not the area under cultivation. Project incremental
production estimates are based on realistic yield assumptions (Annex 14).
Farmer participation in the Project would be staggered over a four-year period,
and full yield levels are assumed to be achieved four years after farmers enter
the Project. The calculation of incremental benefits is shown in Table 5.
4.        Project costs include the costs of farm inputs and capital and
operating costs of off-farm infrastructure. On-farm production costs are
based on a yearly input price forecast (para. 2) and do not include interest
charges and any known taxes or subsidies. Input levels have been assumed
to increase gradually over a 3-4 year period. Hired labor, which is expected
to increase as a result of the Project from the considerable traditional
levels, has been priced at market rates. There appears to be sufficient
casual labor available in the Project area to meet Project demands. No
incremental cost has been attributed to farm family labor because the use of
family labour is the same with and without the Project. The calculations are
shown in Table 6.
v.        Capital and operating costs include all costs shown in Annex 10,
Table 1, except costs of training, studies and research, which are not
directly re'lated to the Project; on-farm inputs-and labor, which have been
recalculated (para. 4); and price contingencies. Operating costs after
1981/82 have been assumed to continue at 1981/82 levels. An average annual
amount, based on an assumed life span of eight years for capital items, has
been allowed for replacement from 1981/82 onwards. These costs, which have
bee- a-justed to eliminate taxes, are shown in Table 7.



ANNEX 16
Page 2
6.        The data in Table 1 indicates that the Project would produce an
internal economic rate of return of 37 percent. At the official exchange
rate, the rate of return would be 34 percent. This high rate of return is
largely attributable to the fact that the Project focuses heavily on current
agricultural production and less on infrastructure, with a consequent shorten-
ing of the gestation period for benefits. The Project is confined to esta-
blished areas of cultivation and to farmers who are already familiar with the
proposed farming systems, thus benefiting from a rapid improvement of low
yields with relatively simple packages of modern inputs.
7.        To test the possible effects of various risks, which are always
considerable in a Project aimed at a large number of small farmers who are
unfamiliar with modern techniques of production, a sensitivity analysis was
undertaken. This analysis revealed that the Project's economic rate of return
is highly sensitive to changes in the value of output, cost of onfarm pro-
duction and the rate of increase in farm yields. The rate of return would be
18% if benefits were reduced by 10%; 12% if benefits were delayed by one year;
and 10% if on-farm production costs increased by 20%. If capital and operat-
ing costs increased by 20% and on-farm production costs and benefits remained
unchanged, the rate of return would be 29%. However, a simultaneous increase
of 10% in all costs and decrease of 10% in benefits would result in a zero
rate of return.
