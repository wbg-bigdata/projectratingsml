Botrmwer. tHis Majesty's Governmen of Nepal (HMG)
w       :  Department of Roads (DOR)
AMgJMi:    SDR 36.6 million (US$ 50.5 million)
Temr:       Standard, with 40 years matrity.
PSer        The Project would include policy and institutional development components and
DescrJQzii: maintenance and rehabilitation programs. The policy components Include introduction of new
mainenance funding mechanisms to ensure timely, adequate fundig for maintenance, and
improvement of sectoral planning. The institutional development component includes: institutional
stregthenng  of the regional and divisional capacities of the Department of Roads (DOR) and 4
District Development Committees (DDCs) to implement maintence and rehabilitation on contract;
taining of DOR and 4 DDCs; speciaist inputs for supervision of works; and studies. The
maintenamce and rehabilitation programs to be financed by IDA include: (a) spport for a backdog
peiodic maintenance program of roads and bridges of the strategic road network in the Central,
Westem, Mid-Western and Far-Western regions including about 500 km of resedling, 150 km of
gravelling and sealing, and minor bridge repairs; (b) rehabilitation and overlays of 300 km of selected
highways and 130 kn of feeder roads of the strategic road network; and (c) a pilot labor-based
district road rehabilitation and mantance omnponent to rehabilitate and maintain 140 km of roads
in 4 selected districts and promotion of appropriate rural transport technology to encourage
community participation in road manteam  and related activities. The Govenment would firw the
ral development of a  mpehenve roiuine maace program by contract.
:ene:       The Project's main benefit would be more efficient, cost effective administration of the road tansport
system, pnoritinztion of sector expendit   and reduction of transport costs. Strengthening DOR
would create a focal point which wil offer technical support and assistmce to local authorites in the
future. The benefits of road rehabilitation and mai ace under the Project consist of savings in
vehicle operatig costs and cost savmgs in mantena. The economic benefits of the Project
indicate that the overall economic rate of ren;rn, as well as that of individual components, would
exceed the oppomnity cost of capital. The benefits for the institutional strengthening and traning
compoents are high but non fiable.
Bi:         At the policy level, the main risks are that the Govemment will bow to political pressures in
developing it's Priority Investment Plan (PIP) and the related three year rolling sectoral funding
programs. To counter this possibility, the PIP must be satisfactory to IDA (and to the other Donors
in the sector), with annal agreement on the updated rolling investment/maintenance programs and
maitenac allocations. Additionally, the Government must establish a mechanism for funding
perodic emergency and routine maintenance of the road network. The main risks for the
infrastructural components of the project are delays in implementation and a failure to implement
opdmal comprehensive maintenance programs.  To mitigate against these risks, supervising
consultants, key advisors and counpart staff will be appointed in May 1994. Additionally, the
sprvisg consultants wi work losely with DOR's staff in prepaing, tendering and implemeting
the annuat work programs.  Relevant specialists wil also be available under the instiutional
development component to provide assistace, parularly on strategic aspects of the rolling
programs. On the institutional aspects of the project, the main riks are the Government's reluctamce
to give DOR the autonomy to reorgaize it's operations to focus only on trunk roads, overdependence
upon the consultants' providing technical assistame and a lack of accountability and motivation on
the part of DOR staff. To promote the development of local capabilities, DOR staff will be integral
memoers of the varous technical assistamce teams and one of the first task of consultants and
advisors will be to prepare detailed plans for the training of countpart staff and the gradual transfer
of reponbities from the   stat to the counterpart staff. Varous safuards, includingteria
for counterpart selei   target andover dates for key responsibilities, operational audits and
planmed periodic reviews have been incorporated into the institutional development programs in an



effort to monitor oveUall impl[enttion. Conimued close oopeatin among donors in the sectr
and carefid mot     by IMA through prect supervision and an idepth mid-term prject review
with HMGIDOR in October 1995 will furthe help to minimize the riss.

ROAD MAMIENANCE AND RlB IL PRJECT
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1          Nepal is located in the foothills of the Himalayas and lies between India's northern border
aid China's southern border. Its per capita income of only US$ 180 is one of the lowest in the world,
and the lowest in South Asia where the average per capita income is US$ 350. Since 1991, the
democratically elected majority Govenmnt has faced the challenge of accelerating economic growth and
development in order to meet the increasing expectations of its 19 million inhabitants, half of which live
in absolute poverty. The Government has embarked on a program of economic reforms which have led
to advances in trade and industry liberalizadon including a unified exchange rate, freeing convertibility
of the current accoum and liberalizing foreign imvestment. The Govenmment has taken initial steps to
reform the civil service and started privatization of public enterprises on a pilot scale and is formulating
a major restructuring program. The main problem, however, is that the fiscal situation remains tight,
revenue efforts are still very poor and implementaion capachies are constrained in most sectors.
1.2          The Govermment has limited capacities to deliver most basic services. In the transport
sector, a core road network is in place, but the Kingdom's difficult topography and severe monsoon rains
make inexpensive, reliable tansport difficult, and some areas are not accessible by road. The lack of
wansport links and pressure on agricultural land in the hill areas have prompted steady migration into the
Terai (plains) which is the country's primary agrcultural resource and accounts for over a third of the
popuaion. Road tramsport is predominant among transport modes and central to the Govermnent's
development strategy. The Govermment considers the proposed Road Mintenance and Rehabilitation
Project a priority to help develop mainte     implementation capacities, safeguard past investments and
realize the benefits of substantial amounts of resources already dedicated to the road network.
1. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
2.1          Nepal's transport system relies heavily on a reladvely recent but modest road network
which serves low taffic volumes. Roads are complemented with trails and civil aviation facilities that
provide access to remote and sparsely populated areas. The transport network evolved from less than
650 km of roads in the mid-fifties, mosdy motorable tracks, to a present network of 8,300 kn of roads,
7,000 km of main trails, 400 modern suspension bridges and 43 airports including 20 short take-off and
landing strips.
A. The laot Sector and the Economr
2.2          During the early stages of transport development between the 1950s and the 1970s, the
transport sector absorbed 36% of total project aid and 28% of total development expenditures. The share
of project aid and development expenditr  for transport projects was reduced as the core roads, trails
and airport networks were developed, declining to 17% and 16%, respectively, in the eighties, and to
less than 12% and 7%, respectively, in the nineties.
2.3          The transport sector accounted for 4.3% of GDP in FY 1991, a decline from nearly 7%
in FY 1981. This small share does not take full account of transport and services by truck-operators
which are often not reflected in the GDP calcultons.
2.4          Road transport is the predominant sub-sector receiving over 80 percent of total transport
public exp iur, followed by aviation with 15%.

B.RodSco
2.5          The road network's backbone is almost completed and comprises two main axes including
the East-West Highway in the Terai and the North-South road connecting India with Cbina through
Katibmandu. The national road network comprises about 8,300 mn, including some 3,000 kIn of paved
roads. With available resources and limited maintenance capabilities, the Government maintains less than
one-fourth of the total network, mostly highways and feeder roads. Moreover, every year upgrading and
extension projects add 200 km to the nmintainable network.
2.6          The network's rapid expansion has been at the expense of rapid road datc.1oration due
to the lack of maintenance finding and capabilities. In 1992, it was estimated that 75% of the total
network was in poor to fair condition, a high percentage compared to other low-income countries where
road networks have been developed recenly. The network's poor condition, compounded by Nepal's
difficult geography and weather, has resulted in high vehicle operating costs and annualized operation
costs four to five times higher than if maintenance were adequate. The resulting high transport costs are
an important constaint to Nepal's economy.
2.7          Nepal's road sector has attracted strong donor support, mainly for new constxuction and
rehabilitatin. In 1992/93, sub-sector allocations amounted to NRs 2.9 billion (US$ 63.0 million
equivalent), of which 40% were from Govenment sources. Donor fumded activities during the last
decade include: (a) road and bridge consucton projects funded by IDA, ADB and the Goverments of
China and India. (b) road flood rebabilitation actvities funded by IDA; (c) rehabilition, improvements
and resaing funded mainly by IDA, ADB, ODA, and SDC; and (d) technical assistance funded by IDA,
AX)B, ODA and SDC. A shifi of focus towards rehabilitation and mntece activities has been favored
durng the last 5 yeas by multlaeral donors and some bilateral donors including ODA and SDC.
2.8         IDA regularly holds donor meetings on the sub-sector to coordinate approaches. A
coordinted donor approach has been developed based on three recent studies including: (a) IDA's report
on "Public Expendiures in the Road Sector' (Report No. 10988,NEP), (b) Asian Development Bank's
(ADB) detailed orgation and management study (O&M) of the road sector (drafit final report October
1992), and (c) the incepon report on th maitnance manaent system prepared by the Main
and Rehabiliionordination Unit (MRCU - August 1992), with SDC and ODA's support. Regarding
HMG resorces for the road sector, the level and composition of road user revemns has not been
addressed as part of road sector fnance initatives. Road user revenues have been growing at a steady
12% per year since PY 1985/86, and in PY 1991/92 revenues from fuel tax, custom duties and sales tax
on vehicles are estimated to represent some NRs 820 million (US$ 16.4 million equivalent) which are
part of central goverment reeus. Recent trends indicace that even though the ratio of road user
revenues to to  expendiures i very low compared to other Asian countries, they amount to more than
four times the astual m_ncem exp _ade.
C. A     n &eto
2.9          Aviation, second only to roads, is an import  mode of tansport in Nepa since mny
areas are inaccessible. A network of 43 aiports of varying stndards serves Nepal and makes many
remote areas accessible. Since 1992, private operators entered the domestic market which was previously
domnated by the national crrier Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation (RNAC).
2.10         Aviation is important for Nepal to support the country's growing tourism industry and
for internal comications, especially in the Hills and Mountis. Ka_mandu's TribhUVan Airport is
the only intational aiport, with 42 additional air-strips which include 26 short tak-off and landin
strips located in the Hills and Mountains. In geneal, conditions at these domestic air-strps are poor,
and services, especially in the Hlls and Mountains, are extremely unreliable. The Government focuses
aviaion invtmes for  gadig fachties at Tribuvan Aiport, pavmg of runways and other



improvements to the domestic air-strips and some maintenance. Large capital improvement projects have
been considered in the past to upgrade Tnbhuvan and Pokhara's airports, but these are unlikely to be
justifiable or feasible given the projected volumes of traffic.
2.11         In FY 1992/93, airport revenues amounted to more than NRs 350 million (US$ 7.0
million equivalent) while projected expenditures amounted to some NRs 460 million (US$9.2 million)
including development and recurrent expenditures. Revenues are more than six times the allocations for
recurrent expenditures. There is a need to critically review the priorities for aviation sector expenditures,
particularly in the areas of navigation aids and other aviation safety enhancements. Maintenance of
aviation facilities is presently very poor due to a lack of funding, :nd the present maintenance allocations
need to be increased at least by ten-fold from the present level of about NRs 10 million per year.
D. Trails and Suspension BIidges
2.12         In the Hills and Mountains, the trail network is extensive and well used, and for those
areas not connected to the road network human porterage remains the only form of transport. With the
development cf a road system, however, the naure of the trail network has changed, with trails no longer
providing long distance transport but feeding the hills from roadheads. With 23 out of 75 districts having
no road access and some 12 distri;cts with a single earth road, many villages are accessible only by porters
travelling on foot. The overall length of these trails is estimated to be around 15,000-20,000 kan,
including 7,000 km of main trails, out of which 5,000 km are concentrated in the three western regions.
2.13         Over time trails have been, and are continuing to be, improved by construction of
pedestrian suspension bridges over rivers and gorges, which improve accessibility and reduce distances.
Some 2,500 trail bridges exist along various routes. Of these, around 400 are modern suspension bridges
constructed by the districts and the suspension bridge division of the Ministry of Works and Transport.
The condition of these bridges is highly variable, and the older bridges are generally in poor condition.

2.14         The management of the transport sector is primarily at the central level with some
responsibilities expected to be grdually transferred to the district level, especially for district roads.
Roads, trails and suspension bridges are the responsibility of the Department of Roads (DOR) in the
Ministry of Works and Transport (MOWT), and aviation is the responsibility of the Department of Civil
Aviation (DCA) in the Ministry of Tourism.
2.15         The Eighth Five Year Plan (EFYP) (1993-97) aims at supporting transportation
development to enhance potential growth sectors and improve regional integration. The EFYP suggests
that a master plan is needed to identify the future national transport system based on regional equity and
growth considerations, integraing the national system with regional and international networks. The
EFYP emphasizes the following priorities: (a) provide road transport to link district headquarters with
national highways; (b) enhance nral transport with improved trails and suspension bridges; (c) complete
the East-West Highway; (d) maintain existing highways and feeder roads and establish a revolving fund
for that purpose; (e) provide access to special national development programs such as hydropower; (f)
develop railways, air transport, ropeways and waterways considering cost efficiency and tourism
potential; (g) develop urban transport; and (h) consider developing a tunnel to improve access between
Kathmandu and the Terai.
2.16         The priorities of the EFYP for the sector introduce three concepts which are fimdamental
even though they are imbedded in a statement heavily biased towards constrction. First, the necessary
links between level of service and construction and mainace activities are to be established. Second,



-4 -
environmental considerations are brought in, even though not strongly enough to weigh against the
proposed emphasis on new district roads requiring north-south connections. Third, the concept of a
sector revolving fund to support maintenance operations is introduced. The EFYP starts to address
sustainability of investments, but no attempt is made to define cleatly the sense of mission of public
agencies and the development of private sector participation in the provisior, of transportation services.

2.17         The proposed Project would be the fiRfh IDA transport sector operation in Nepal. In the
past IDA has financed three road projects and one flood rehabilitation project with emphasis on roads and
bridges, in addition to financing a few irrigation roads as part of agriculture projects. IDA's involvement
in the transport sector has been successfil. The projects' physical objectives have been generally met
although difficult economic conditions, political changes and limited institutional capabilities have often
caused delays.
2.18         IDA's transport sector strategy is to support policies and investments that prioritize scarce
resources on programs which are central to the attainment of the main sectoral objectives of the EFYP.
The main focus of IDA's transport strategy would be to ensure that the highest priority be given to the
following investments: completing the East-West Highway, maintaing the strategic road network,
emnphasizing the development of a farm-to-market network in support of agricultural development in the
Terai, and providing access to important national development projects. IDA's strategy would also focus
on the following policy insuments: (a) prioritizing sector expenditur  to contribute to the country's
strategy of expenditure priortization through the development of a sector-wide priority investment plan
and review process based on network-based planning and basic data considering new construction,
upgrading and rehabilitation on the basis of economic criteria; (b) insuring fimding for maintenance of
the strategic transport networks; and (c) establishing a sector expenditure ceiling based on the rolling
three-year budget review process that will start in FY 1993/94. The strategy, is elaborated in
"Expenditures in the Road Sector" and in the background papers of the "Infrastructure Development
Strategy" (Report in preparation No. 11800-NEP).
2.19         In order to insure adequate connections between Nepal's road network and the port in
Calcutta through which most goods bound for Nepal are imported, IDA is assisting HMG with the
preparation of a proposed Multimodal Transit and Trade Facilitation Project which will focus on
providing the necessary infrastructure to improve transit of Nepal's cargo through India, lower the cost
of imports, and increase the competitiveness of exports. The proposed Project would finance the
development of a broad gauge rail siding into Birgunj from Raxaul, India, a nmultimodal freight tenrinal
at Birgunj and technical assistance for trade and transit facilitation.

3.1          Road expitures as a proportion of GDP have been declining from levels above 3%
before 1970 to 1.6% in 1991. The trend observed is the opposite to the growth observed in public
expenditures as a proportion of GDP. Such a decrease in sctor expenditures (in relative terms) occurred
at a time when the Govemment focused on expanding the road network leaving few resources to develop
necessary capabilities to manage and operate the growing capital stock.
3.2          The vehicle fleet in Nepal is very small amounting to only 55,000 vehicles, including
some 6,000 trucks and 6,000 buses. The vehicle fleet has grown steadily at about 7% annually based
on official figures. The typical truck is the Indian TATA vehicle which carries an average load of 10
tons resulting in gross vehicle weights of 15-16 tons. The general patten of road use is one of very low
utilization, with average ammal daily traffic (AADT) on inter-urban roads ranging between 100-1,600



vehicles per day (vpd). The traffic along strategic highways includes over 67% of heavy vehicles. The
maximu MAADT observed is in the road from Katumandu to the Indian border at Birgunj with 1,600
vpd. The East-West Highway traffic volumes average AADTs of 300-1,200 vpd.
3.3          Roads in Nepal are important to all aspects of economic and social development. The
most important linkages are betwem roads and agricultural production, regional exchanges and import
flows. In particular, given thai production in Nepal is relatively dispersed and considering the high
dependency on imports, economic exchanges between the main production and consumption areas are
heavily dependent on road transport.
3.4         In the case of collector (feeder) and local access (district) r3ads, the main linkage between
road rehabiliationimdrovement and economic development is the expected increase in aericultural
production. Successful agricultural development is highly dependent on access to markets and timely
provision of inputs. The importance of adequate roads to agricultural developmen in Nepal has been
often cited as a crucial element to increase aggregate agricultuial production. Studies in Nepal confirm
that road access reduces transport costs and facilitates agricultural modernization.
3.5          In the case of arterial (highways) roads, with higher levels of traffic (i.e., above 80
vehicles per day), the maain linkage between road rehabilitation/improvement and economic development
is the expected reduction in vehicle operating costs. Estimates prepared for the Project indicate that
savings of up to 20% of vehicle operating costs could be achieved by improving a road from fair to good
condition, and 80% from poor to good condition. Considering that Nepal's highway road network (2,300
knms) accounts for about 90 percent of total vehicle-kilometers and that vehicle usage factors are low on
average, amounting some 20,000 kilometers per year, it is not disproportionate to estimate that there are
an estimated 990 million vehicle-kilometers every year. Based on this rough and imperfect assessment,
the benefits to road users isulting from improvements to 50 percent of the arterial network (i.e., 400
km of roads in fair condition, and only 600 kn in poor condition) could amount to some US$16-24
million per year.
3.6          The benefits stemming from road maintenance can be calculated as net savings in public
expenditures as a result of reduced annualized agency costs for operations and maintenance of the
stategic network and reduction of the erosion of gross fixed capital investments. "Expenditures in the
Road Sector" stated that the anulized operation costs of the road network in Nepal could be reduced
by a factor of 6 with the development and inplementtion of proper maintenance systems and by a factor
of 2 only with minimum maintenance capabilities (i.e., routine maitenance). In absolute terms, the
report indicates that safeguarding past investments through the implementation of a periodic and routine
maintenance could save some US$28 million per year (Annex 1).
3.7          The benefits from road c  tution in areas with development potential are also
associated with a reduction in transport costs which often expand the frontiers of production processes
by modifying the relative returns to labor and capital, increasing access to markets and making inputs
available. Due to variations in each region's potential, geograhical constraints, distance from the main
markets, availability of complementary infstructure, and nature of the products, the rates of return can
vary widely from case to case.

3.8          MOWT is responsible for roads and road transport. Within the MOWT, the Departnent
of Roads (DOR) MOWT is responsible for the plamning, design, construction and maintenance of the
national road network (i.e., highways. feeder and district roads), while the Department of Transport
Management (DOTM) is responsible for road transport regulations and policies. Recently enacted
legislation allows District Development Committees (DDCs) to assume responsibility for local access
roads which account for 3,000 km of classified district roads.

3.9          The Govermnent's present strategy emphasizes network extensions to link all district
centers with the main road corridors, which has constraied the Govenument's ability for improving
mainteance capabilities. However, realizing the high costs of road deterioration, DOR and the Ministry
of Finance (MOF) are gradually starting to focus on increasing institutional, financial and private sector
capacities for periodic and routine maintenance, starting with bringing the strategic network (4,000 kan
of bighways and feeder roads) to a maintainable condition (1,500 bn or 20% of the total road network).
3.10         The MOWT and DOR successfully conducted a Policy Action Planning (PAP) Workshop
on Road Maintenance last February with MOF and the National Planning Commission (NPC). The
worksiop mcreased awareness in Nepal that the past strategy of allowing roads to deteriorate to an
unserviceable condition and then rehabilitating them is four to five times more costly than maintaining
them on a reguar basis. Following the workshop, MOWT has established the mechanism to fund
periodic, emergency and routine maintenance of the road network during FY 1993/94 (financed from toll
taxes) with ,pproved guidelines and procedures which made the existing revolving fund operational.
FurtheroriM, efforts are underway to modify the revolving fund into a Road Maintenance Fund, dedicated
to road maintenance activities by contract and financed from a share of road user charges. NPC and
MOF have agreed with the concept. DOR with donor support is developing a maintenance management
system which would provide basic inputs into the preparation of the annual mamtenance programs based
on an assessment of technical and economic criteria. The workshop also included discussions on the
nstimional strategy, considering the creation of an autonomous road authority, perhaps initially
responsible only for manaining Nepal's strategic highway network including operating toll roads. The
workshop concluded that Nepal's current administive environment isn't conducive to the creation of
an effective, truly autonomous authority, and suggested that institutional efforts should focus on ways to
strengte DOR with assistance to management through specialist advisors.

3.11         The proposed Project would be the fifth IDA road operation in Nepal. The first two
highway projects were satisfactorily completed but with considerable delays due to material shortages and
inefficiencies in adminisrton. Upgrading DOR's maintnance capabilities and its personnel skills and
organizational practices was not as effective as anticipated. The Third Highway - Credit 1515-NEP -
(UJS$ 47.5 million of August 1984) and Road Flood Rehabilitation Project - Credit 1922-NEP - (US$ 15.5
million of May 1988) were delayed due to the 1989 trade and transit impasse with India and the
subsequent political changes in the country. Although the 3rd Highway Project has fallen four years
behind schedule, physical implemention has been generally good and quality high, and the project was
essentially completed in December 31, 1993 with additional flood related repairs pending. Training of
heavy equipment mechanics and other persomel began under the Second Highway Project - Credit 730-
NEP - and has continued satisfactorily during this project. Tihe Road Flood Rehabilitation Project -
Credit 1922-NEP - is expected to meet its objectives with a two year implementation delay. Past projects
embodied a strategy of support for construction, inadequate attention to maintenance, and necessity of
rehabilitation. While constmution and rehabilitation targets were achieved, usually with delay,
maintenance capacity was not increased. Other recurrent problems relate to the ineffective project
management and momitoring. The proposed Project aims at supporting institutional strengthening and
hunan resource development, and improving the technical and managerial skills of counterpart staff
through extensive training and technical assistance. The increasing demands for maintenance funding
resulting from IDA and other donor-supported road projects indicate that a coordinated road policy
framework is now necessary to ensure the sustainability of past investments.
3.12         IDA's strategy in Nepal is to support expenditure prioritization to encourage optimal use
of scarce public resources. The strategy for the road sector has been developed in "Expenditures in the
Road Sectora which idenified four main sector constaints including: (a) lack of network-based planning,
programmg and budgeting, (b) inadequate allocations for mantenan  and constraints affecting fiun
release procedures, (c) institutional and human resource related constraints, and (d) limited absorptive

caai es affectn operations. The       s1ectr strtey   accords the highest priority to: (a)
shifting resou   allocaion in the sector to develop maintenance capabilities; (b) completing essential on-
goin new conuction; (c) developing farmi-market roads in the Terai; (d) improving accessibility
between Katmandu and the Teral; and (e) improving trails and suspension bridges in the hills. The
increse in maintance expendur  and capabilities could be done by developing a timely, reliable and
adequate funding mechnis  for road mainteon , and concentrtng DOR's capabilities on the trunk
road network (i.e., highways and feeder roads) and DDCs' responsibilities for district roads.
3.13         The strategy suggests actions in four areas including: (a) developing network-based
planing, improving collection and disburmnt of funds and introducing performance budgeting; (b)
insuring adeque, timely funing for road mait ; (c) increasing efforts and coordinating initiatives
that support nstitutdoal development and human resource development; and (d) ncreasing the capacity
of domestic contractors, improving mainteance conact management (e.g., adoption of appropriate
standards, inoductio of improved quality control m - _), and introducing routine maitenance
on conact (to replace force account).
3.14         IDA's instautional sruengtheing and human resource development strategy builds upon
the O&M report and on-going tainng initiaives and has two main compones inchding: (a) supportng
the developmen of strategic planning in the road sector by strengthening NPC's transport unit and DOR's
planing unit, and compledng the road maitenane inforation system in DOR/MRCU and its expansion
to the field operational units; and (b) supporting institutonal strengthening and on-the-job training to
develop and establish cental and regional level implemettion capacities to manage and operate the road
and bridge network (as ecommended by the O&M repor).

3.15         Nepal's 8,300 km national road network includes 2,300 km of arterial (highways) roads,
1,700 km of collector (feeder) roads, 3,100 km of local access (district) roads, and 1,200 kn of urban
roads. The total network includes 3,000 km of paved roads, 2,200 knm of gravel roads and 3,100 kn of
earth roads.
3.16         The prolonged neglect and defrral of road maintance have resulted in road
deterioration which has ateuted the utility of the substant  efforts made in the past to exnd the road
network. Estimates prepared in "Expenditr in the Road Sector", based on very limited and imperfect
infomatio, indicate that at least 75 percent of all roads are in poor to fairl' condition (i.e., 50 and 25
percent in poor and fair condition, respectively). (Table 1)
3.17         In FY 1991/92, road sector allocations and ependitue amounted to NRs 2.5 and 2.2
bilion (US$ 50 and 44 million equivalent), respectively, inclung 38% of expenditures for rehabilitation
and 6% for md n. In FY 1992/93, road sector allocations amounted to NRs 2.9 billion (US$ 63
million equivalent) including only 3% for main . The change in allocations indicates higher
allocations for new constuction. The gap that existed between resource allocations, that reflect resource
needs, and substantally lower actal expendu, that reflect revised budgetary allocations, has been
reduced since FY 1989/90. The gap reflects revised allocations and limited implementation capacity.

assessment of the field capacity and
efficiency of force account operations). Based on data available, it is not clear to what extent the benefits
of mantenance are actually realized in the areas covered.
3.19         The distibution of resources between central and regional offices, as well as among
regions, indicates important recent trends as follows: (a) Increasing district level egmenditures. Even
though central expenditur  predominate (over 90%), there is a noticeable increase in district level
allocations. District level expendit   also display higher levels of budget performance. This trend
would inevitably result in a wider spread of road construction and mntenance activities. Accompanying
the above trend, the plan proposed for the coming five years includes a shift favoring reduced allocations
for arterial and collector roads and increased allocations for local access roads. The FY 1993/94 budget
increases grants transferred directly to District Development Committees by 80% by supporting direct
trasfer of 75% of the realized land tax; (b) Regional dispersion of construction activities. Road
expenditure on constuction have traditionally been concentrated in a few areas of the Hills and Terai
in Easter, Central and Western Nepal. Recent trends indicate increasing emphasis on rehabilitadon of
exstig roads (in the areas tradidtonally favored for construction) and increased construction in the
outying areas, in particular Hill and Mountain ecological zones; and (c) Shift from construction to
oehabfitation. There is a noticeable trend towards increasing rehabilitation which has become necessary
de to the neglect of maitnance actvities. As pointed out above, life-cycle costs for roads which
require rehabilitation due to indequate maintenc are up to 6 times as high as applying recurrent
routine maintenance.
3.20          Under a tight budgetary constraint, the policy followed by HMG has been to spend the
same insuicient amount every year, with a reduction in allocations in real terms for periodic and routine
maintnan. This practice is not rommended. Under a tight budgetary constraint, on the contrary,
the impact of expenditres could be increased by focusing on what can be done to maximize and optimize
the use of available resources, e.g., mantaining a strategic network and reducing the emphasis on low
priority new construction. In economic terms, this means focusing on the highest economic returns to
al expndt.
3.21         Road rehabilitation and maitenance policies have now been defined to cover the essential
backlog of rehabilitation, and periodic, routine and emergency maintenance of the strategic network.
Considering the present condition of the network, the strategy for the network would be to:
(a)   rehabilitate about 300 km of highways and 130 km of feeder roads of the
stategic road networkwhich are in fair to poor condition, through a combination
of overlays and minor improvements (highways) and surface treatent and
gravelling (feeder roads);
(b)    gradually increase the capacity to carty out periodic mainenance (i.e.,
resurbcing, gravelling and sealing) of the strategic network in poor to fair

condition to avoid thdei reaching the poor condition, including about 650 kIn in
the next four years; and
(c)   cury out routine mWntenpam s on tie strategic network in good and fair
condition, stegdth     operations at the Division level (a Division covers
several polil disticts), and develop the capacity to prepare for emergency
repairs during the monsoon period.
Under this strategy, the maitean  bacldog of the strategic road network would be addrsed during
the Project. The level of resources needed to address the backlog of the strategic network over the next
four years (i.e., for additional rehabilitation and maintenance) is estimated at about US$ 135 million.
The total requrements for the road setor in the first rolling three year-plan are estimated to average
about US$ 70 million per year, startng at about US$ 55 million in FY 1993/94 which is conse
with sectoral budget allocations. Reducing the mainnane bacldog would result in total anmnal benefits
amounting at least US$ 40 million per year.
F. Rd 
3.22         Road user revenu  are an important but decreasing source of Govemment revenue
amountig to some 6 percent of total revenues. Road user revemnes in Nepal, i.e., fuel and vehicle
red  taxes, are not earmarkd, and their level and composition have not been addressed as part of road
sector finance inis. Recent trends, however, indicate that even though the ratio of road user
revenues to  d exN_diures is very low compared to other countries in the region, they amounted to
more than four times the actual m expendures during the period. Esdmates show that road
user revenues are sufficient to cover the estimated short-run marginal costs of road network operaion.
In the medium term, the struture of road user revemns should be addressed to encourage efficient fleet
composition and utilizaton, as well as to provide sufficient and timely resources for road maintenance.
Road sector revenues are now increasing at a pace  m_e with inflaton, well below the real
average  owth rate of total Govemnent revenues, and below expected marginal incrses in road
operations' costs.
3.23         In the fumre, it is proposed that road maintean  activities be financed from: (a) the
revolving fund or the Road Maintenance Fund, if established, which would be financed with a share of
road user charges, (b) central governm  revemnes, and (c) credit resomces.
F. Road nawg and Bhdggng
3.24         The planning and budgedng proosses in the road sector have serious deficiencies.
3.25         lack of Network-Based Planning.  Road sector resource allocations reveal an
ovewhelming emphasis on new cotuction with contnuos under-funding of mateance budgets.
Politically mandaed priorities rather hm economic efficiency considerations cloud the rational allocation
of resources. Under-finding of on-going and new contuctionprojects reflects the absence of a planning
approach which has firther weakened past ilStitution building efforts and reduced the value of
investmens. Past road sector plans have been very ambitious and unealitic in the context of the limited
institutional capabilities and resource availabit. Resource allocation in the road sector needs to de-
emphasize new  constuction and accord priority to safeguard   past investments and developing
institutional capabilities to manage the road networL The Eighth Five Year Plan (EFYP) includes some
posive develoments in this direction. The sector objective in the future could be to minimize national
transport costs over time (considering road expenditu  plus vehicle operatng costs to road users).

activities in roads of the strategic network based on economic criteria with available data, and
development of a network analysis in each district to assemble pre-feasibility level data on potentially
viable new construction projects in each district. Addressing priority maintenance of strategic roads
under the proposed Project by guaranteeing funding and exandig implementation capabilities during
the next four years would be a major achieement in the prioritization of sector expenditures. In an effort
to start the process of prioritization, HMG has indicated in the budget for FY 1993194 that new project
starts would be limited. HMG is also undeaking a sector by sector prioritization by NPC, now under
discussion with the line Ministries. A roUling first three-year program for FY 1994/95 would be prepared
by HMG to be discussed with IDA before April 1994. T'he highest priority in the road sector would need
to be given to incomplete and on-going new construction, rehabilitation and maintenance based on
network needs. The next step, agreed during appraisal and confirmed during negotiations with the
Government, would be the development of a Priority Investment Plan (PIP) and a review process,
covering construction and maintenance in the transport sector.2 The Govenment has agreed to support
the preparation of a PIP, with an emphasis on developing planning capabilities in DOR and NPC and
ensuring adequate participation of local groups and specialists.
3.27         Inadequate Bud=eina. Budget preparation for the road sector in Nepal could be improved
considerably. The Government expenditures are not defined and classified in terms of road projects'
objectives or of inputs and outputs. The budget does not even differentiate emergency and recurrent
mainnance within the routine   tennce budget. In fact, the budget format (project proforma) appers
to be more detailed than necessary to secure approval and is used as a project work plan.
3.28         Due to limited institutional capabilities, lack of systemic data collection (i.e., road
condition surveys, traffic counts and unit costs) and the strong influence of seasonality, mainna
budgeting processes in Nepal remains haphazard. Regardin routine and emerMencv maintenance, there
is no systematic budget exercise followed to estmaterequirements. A dependable maintenance budgetg
procedure is now being developed in DOR by the Maitenane Rehabilitation Coordination Unit (MRCU)
with donor support (ODA and SDC). MRCU is preparing the basis to esmate the needs for routine,
recurrent and emergency mantenae, involving DOR engineers at the district, regional and hedquarts
level. Division level improvements on budgeting and operations are being introduced division-by-division
as part of the Strengthened Mainteance Division (SMD) program funded by SDC and HMG. Annual
budget estimates would be prepared by DOR's Planming Unit/Data Cell based on condition surveys,
network-based priorities, traffic volumes, road location and seasonal distribution of activities. A clear
defition of responsibilities for roufine, recurrent and emergency maitnance budgeting would emerge
gradually as a consensus on the revised appropriate standards, average productivities, budget preparation
methodology, and performance meures is developed. Regardig periodic maintenance budgeting, it
only amounts to an aggregation of project specific requirements without adequate consideration of
network-based requirements, much less of resource availability. Project preparation has focused on
network-based planning to improve resource allocation for periodic maintenance. The budgeting of
periodic maintance activities would be revamped as MRCU implements the necessary data collection
and analysis based on a simple maintenc management system to set priorities, define levels of
intervention (by type of road, traffic levels and location), and set periodic maintenance standards (i.e.,
technical standards and periodicity for each activity). Such a system is expected to focus on the strategic
network in a mainnable condition.
3.29         Issues in Budget Execution. Efforts are required to reduce delays that result from
procedural, regulatory and administrative constraints. The Project needs corrective actions to improve,
streamline and rationalize fund releases to guarantee that Project benefits materialize.
3.30         Lack of Performance Budgeting. In the past, the absence of planning and the problems
with budgeting have redu    the possible linkges between planning and budgeting exercises. Efficient

and traspare budgeting procedures now require the establishment of simple quanifiable objectives and
quality control which could be reviewed periodically In order to assess each budgeting exercise and to
provide feedback to the upcoming planning process. Financial and technical audits of road operations
need to be promoted as essenta elements to develop sound planning and budgeting for the sector.
G. Rod.Mad  NpMeMQratioans ad MaS
3.31         Rehabilitaton and periodic mtenance activities are executed by contract, but routine
mantnance activities are generally executed by force account and are very inefficient. Realizing the
low-impact of force account opeatons, DOR is endorsing a policy of introducing on a pflot basis routine
maintenane by contract. In July 1993, the MRCU with SDC support started a pilot routine maintenance
effort in three Strengthened Maintena    Divisions (SMDs) (i.e., two SMDs including Chitwan, Dhading
and Lalitpur disticts which inctude the recently completed Naubise-Mugling Road financed under Cr.
1515-NEP) which will experiment with alternative ways of organizing routine maintance (i.e.,
combinations of force account and maintenance on contract). The experiment will include lmited
technical assistance to the divisions and logistc support and would introduce improved financial
management and internal accounting for routne maintenance. The introduction of routine maintenance
by contact based on the expeiences of the 2 SMDs would be expaded gradually to about 14 districts
during the Project (pam. 4.21).
3.32         Mai        practies in Nepal are very costly and inefficient. Existing maitenance
operations and management suffer from: (a) the lack of maintenance planning and a unified set of
standards for the county, (b) the absece of quality control in a large proportion of locally funded
operations, (c) weak denaton and reporting, (d) lack of adequate supvision of road minnance
conacts, and (e) lack of equipment to supplement small contractor capacities.
3.33         The lack of maitenance planning has long been a constraint to prepare maintenance
strategies, multi-year and yearly mainance programs under a budget constrait. The MRCU is
grdualy developing the capacity in DOR to prepare such program, by developing: (a) a baseline survey
of the network and review system (i.e., establishing a network planning cell, a central road reference
datase, conducting a pavement condition survey stem and a traffic inventory system); (b) developing
a simplified system in-ose to prepare amuial work programs; (c) developing procedures for storing and
processing the network and road specific data; and (d) monitoring maintence costs and procedres.
3.34         The preparaion studies for the Project have developed a set of standard specifications for
periodic maitenance operations. DOR/MRCU are presently reviewing the Nepal Road Sttndards and
expect to issue the document iluding maintenance standards before May 1994. DOR has taken the
initiative of including laboratory services in the forms of agreement with supervision consultants to
encourage the development of private laboraory facilities. In order to address the remaining constraints
affectig mai        operations, the Project would need to incorporate quality control guidelines,
simplify mana              on and reporting (a maintenance manual is under preparation and would
need to be implemented), and increase incentives for improved supervision by insuring that adequate and
timely resources are made available to hire consultants as engineer's reprentatves to supervise
matenac on contract. Also, efforts are needed to increase the commercial oriention of existing
public-owned equipment by consolidatng the existing plant pool in operable condition, supplementing
the fleet with appropriate small equipment and improving management of DOR's fleet for hire.
EL rd d T
3.35         DOR employs about 3,000 staff, including personnel attached from the MOF and MOGA.
The employee to network ratio (about one employee per three kilometers) is in line with other countries
where labor-based methods are employed. However, the number of professionals at about 650 is high
compared to the total work force. DOR employs over 10 percent of the engineers in Nepal. Of Nepal's



- 12 -
2,865 engineers in 1992, DOR employed 346 (including temporary staff) until November 1992, when
32 engineers Class I were reired from the civil service, leaving only 6 engineers Class I in DOR's
management. Overall, there are few inctives to attract, retain and motivate experienced staff to join
both DOR and DOTM. One of the few ways to retain the most experienced engineers available to DOR
is to assign them as seconded staff to participate in donor-funded projects and to develop training
programs associated with career development.
3.36         During Project preparation, MOWT and DOR staff have emphasized the need for a
comprehensive training program to support human resource development and improve the technical and
managerial skills of counterpart staff. The main training needs identified during Project preparation
include: (i) training DOR's management in planning, programming and budgeting; (ii) training DOR's
engieers and contractors in road maenance operations, contract management and supervision, and
monitoring; (iii) contiue on-going training of equipment mechanics, operators and laboratory technicians
(DOR and private sector); and (iv) training DDCs' staff and contractors in labor-based methods for
district road rehabilitation. During appraisal, agreement was reached between HMG/IDA/ODA/SDC on
the human resources and institutional development strategy for the next four years which would focus on
strengthening the operational capacity of DOR (details below in the sector strategy).
I. EnLmnt  Saferu&ds
3.37         DOR has established an environmental unit in the Planning Section to develop
environmental assessment mainly of new construction projects. During Project preparation, a Sectoral
Envirnental Assessment (SEA) has been undertake to develop a simple, standard and practical
methodology to assess environmet  considerations during the design and construction of all DOR
projects. DOR has agreed to implement the methodology initially for screening of maintenance contracts
funded under the Project and to incorporate in Project documents and engineering designs the specific
clauses recommended i the SEA to ensure environmental safeguards in respect of: (a) landscaping
borrow areas, quarries and spoil tips; (b) storage areas and especially those for diesel fuel and bitumen;
(c) for office yards to avoid groundwater and stream pollution; and (d) slope stabilization. The Project
would include an action plan to insure adequate support to incorporate the SEA into DOR's project
appraisal procedures. (para. 4.34)
J. Sector Strateafv
3.38         The report "Public Expenditur  in the Road Sector" identified four main sector
constraints including: (a) lack of network-based planning, programming and budgeting, (b) inadequate
allocations for maitenan  and const     affecting fimd release procedures, (c) institutional and human
resource related constraints, and (d) limited absorptive capacities affecting operations. The recommended
sector straeg accords the highest priority to: (a) shifting resource allocation in the sector to develop
maintenance capabilities; (b) completing essential on-going new construction; (c) developing farm-to-
market roads in the Terai; (d) improving accessibility between Kathmandu and the Terai; and (e)
improving trails and suspension bridges in the hills. The increase in maintenance expenditures and
capabilities could be done by developing a timely, reliable and adequate funding mechanism for road
maintenance, and conceting DOR's capabilities on the trunk road network (i.e., highways and feeder
roads) and DDCs' responsibilities for district roads. The strategy suggests actions on four areas
including: (a) developing network-based planning, improving collection and disbursement of funds and
introducing performance budgeting; (b) insuring adequate, timely funding for road maintenance; (c)
increasing efforts and codiatin  itiatives that support human resource and institutional development;
and (d) increasing the capacity of domestic contractors, improving maintenance contract management
(e.g., adoption of appropiae standards, introduction of inproved quality control mechanisms), and
itoducng routine mantenan  on contract (to replace force account).



- 13-
3.39         The human resources and institutionaldevelopnent (HRID) strategy agreed for the Project
would emphasize human resource development efforts to encourage DoR's staff, contractors and
consultants to acquire and develop needed skills in road sector operations and development through
focused short and long-enn traiinig inputs, and institutional strengthening efforts to enable DOR to
manage resources more efficiently within a chaging emniromnent. The HRID strategy builds upon the
O&M report and on-going training initiatives and consists of short and long-term objectives. In the short
term, the main objectives would be to: establish a focal point in DOR to coordinate and manage road
sector training; establish and organize on-the-job training for DOR's staff and contractors; assist DOR
with the establishment of regional level implementation capacities for periodic and routine road
maintenance; and assist DOR to encourage better management practices. The associated short term
training inputs would include: specialist inputs to coordinate training; on-the-job training for DOR's
technical staff and local contractors in budgeting, supervision of works, quality control, contract
management md procurement related to periodic maintenance operations; specific training for DOR's
managers; and a small training/study exercise to include visits by a few key Nepalese officials to other
countries to assess institutional options to manage road networks including road authorities and
government departments. The IOg term objectives would include: (a) supporting the completion of a
road maintenance infrmation system in DOR/MRCU; (b) supportng the development of planning
capabilities in NPC's transport unit and DOR; (c) condmied support for the Mechamics and Operators
Training Workshop including training of trainers, redesigmng and improving training programs to attract
senior mechanics, laboratory technicians and workshop supervisors, providing necessary machine tools
and laboratory eunent, and ensuring adequate mnenance and operation of the training facilities; (d)
trainig of DDCs staff and contractors in labor-based methods for district road rehabilitation; (e) bridge
management (i.e., road and trail bridges); (f) geotechnical and environmental engineering to establish
sound road side support practies in DOR including implementation of the sector environmental
assessment; (g) improve plant opeaions increasing the commercial orientation of the heavy equipment
divisions; and (h) road safety to develop and support a national road safety strategy.
IV. I= PROJECT
A. Proiect Orig-. Obectives and Rationale
4.1          ho=       i   The Project's concept developed as a result of the experience from
previous IDA-financed road sector operations which highlighted the need to develop maintenance
capabilities, the county's strategy of improving the efficiency of public expenditures and hence
prioritization, and the re-activation of efforts to decentralize some administrative functions of Government
which would allow DOR to focus on the stegic road network. The Project strategy supports the sector
strategy developed in wExpen   in the Road Sector'.
4.2          P_roject Obqjtives. The primary objective of the Project is to address the development
of road mannce capabilities and support maintenance and rehabilitation activities, by: (a) insuring
adequate funding of priority m ai     actvities by establishing fumding and budgeting arrangements
which would chamel a much greater, timely flow of funds to support maintenance within sectoral
allocation ceilings based on a rolling 3-year priority investment program to be revised annually and
reviewed with IDA; (b) strengthening sectoral planning by introducing network-based plamning, initially
to prioritize maintenance and teafter to support the development of a Priority Investment Plan (PIP)
and review process for all sector investments; (c) inproving public sector implementation capacity to
expand the coverage and enbance the quality of maintnance with a program of institutional strengthening
and human resource development based primarily on training and technical assistance inputs (establish
regional maintenance capabiLities, coordinate and develop a comprehensive training program for DOR's
staf  and increasing incentives to DOR staff with increased funding levels for road mintenance,
enhanced quality control, and introduction of performance targeting; (d) supporting development of
private sector capabilities to do mantenance on contract by supporting on-the-job training, improving
procurem  of maitenance contracts, gradually developing a critical mass of yearly or multi-yearly



- 14-
ma_ntnan  conacs, streamd_ning contract supervision and insuring timely and regulr fumding and
payments; and (d) testing ways to develop DDCs' road matenance capabilities for local access roads
(i.e., distict roads) through a pilot project. In general, the Project would be aimed at reducing vehicle
operat  costs and the delays associated with a deteriorated road system and generating much-needed
rura employment trough adoption of labor-based technologies (appropriate and efficient combination
of existing capital or labor intensive techniques).
4.3          Rationale for IDA Involvement. IDA's involvement would support an overhaul of road
administrtion and maintenance  d contribute to the country's strategy of expenditure prioritization to
encourage optimal use of scarce public resources. IDA's involvement would strengthen the process of
institution building and foster broad-based donor support for a common program of mainten     and
rehabilitation. The Project would be a deparure from past projects in which the core was a program of
selected road investments, complemented with institutional reforms that were incremental in nature. In
conrast, the Project would emphasize the development of permanent institutional capacity (for planning,
programing, budgeting design, construction and mantenance), supplemented with support for essent_i
investments in physical works.
B. Project -Descrluon
4.4          The proposed Project would include policy and institutional development components and
maintenane and rehabilitation programs.
(a) Polw  and bstonal Development
4.5          The policy component would include introduction of new maintenance funding
nsbanism to ensure timely, adequate funding for maintenance, and improvement of sectoral planning.
The institutional development component would include: instiuonal strengtheing of the regional and
divisional capacities of DOR and four DDCs to implement aintnce on contract, training of DOR and
four DDCs, specialist inputs for supervision of works, and sudies.
4.6          Funding Mechanisms. The Project would require EHMG to prepare and annually update
multi-yearly and yearly road sector e dite and funding programs. Before nefotiations, MOWT and
MOF forwarded the FY 1993/94 rouftne, emergency, recurrent and periodic maintenance programs for
IDA's review, and doumentation confiming the increase in mantenance fimding in FY 1993/94 to NRs
230 million which would be sufficient to address current network needs. Durngnegotiations, agreements
were reached with 1MG on: (i) average amual road sector allocation and expenditure ceilings should not
exceed US$ 70 million equivalent over the Project period, with a share (increasing from 10% to 15%)
earmarkd for penodic and routine road manenance; and (i), maintenmce fumding for each subeque
fiscal year should be increased to NRs 276 in FY 94/95, NRs 331 million in FY 95/96, NRs 397 million
in FY 96/97 and NRs 476 million in FY 97/98 (details in Annex 9). The maintenance funding targets
would be subject to an annual review process between the Government and the cofinanciers of the
Project. In order to address the need for a timely, reliable funding mechanism for maintenace, the
Goverment has approved the guidelines ad procedures to operationalize the existing revolving fund,
effectively establishing the mechaism for maintenance funding which satisfies a condition for Board
presentation.
4.7          SectoPl B==. During Project preparation DORIMRCU have undertaken to develop
a baseline data base and introduce network-based planning, initially to prioritize mainenance. During
implementation, the Project would support the development of a Priority Investment Plan (PIP) and
review process for all sector investments. The PIP would be developed through participatory approaches
with specialist consuts with a view to develop capabilities to review it periodically in DOR and NPC.
1gft  agggMM,  assurances were obtained from MOF/MOWT/DOR to review the proposed three-
year rolling plan for the sector every year of the Project with IDA, and periodically with other donors.



- 15 -
During negotiatiQns, it was agreed that the preparation of a priority investment plan (PIP) for new
couction, upgradig and maintnaince would be developed according to an agreed Terms of Reference,
and to forward for IDA's review the draft Letter of Invitation and shordist of consultants by September
1, 1994, in order to obtain the draft and final reports, respectively, by July and December 1996, as inputs
for the Ninth Five Year Plan. (Annex 7) Assurances were also obtained from HMIG that the PIP will be
given priority.
4.8          Insittional  thening. The institutional strengthening component is based on the
O&M study, complemnted by a detailed assessment of training requirements prepared for the Project
(se details in Annex 2), and would support insttutional strengthening of MOWT, DOR and four DDCs
(15.6% of total Project cost), and includes components fuanced in parallel by IDA, ODA and SDC.
4.9          The IDA-financed components (9.1%) include: (a) field implementation advisers for
backlog periodic and rouine maintenance (2.9%); (b) continued support for the Mechanics and Operators
Trainig Workshop includig training of trainers, redesigning and improving training programs to attract
senior mechanics, laboratory technicians and workshop supervisors, providing necessary machine tools
and laboratory equipment, and ensuring adequate maintenance and operation of the training facilities
(1.0%); (c) consultant services for special studies on road construction and maintenance materials,
assisunce for the preparation of the PIP (road master plan), follow-up of the road contractor industry
sudy, conducting an operational audit of maintenance and rehabilitation operations, developing the
magement plan for Bardiya Natonal Park to address possible adverse environmental impacts of
completed road construction under Cr. 1515-NEP, and preparation study for follow-up to pilot labor-
based district road cponent (5%); (d) specialis assistance for maintenance of the Karnali Bridge
(0.05%); and (e) implementation of the sector environental assessment (0.1%). The UNDP would
support the District Road Services Development Unit (DRSDU) and labor-based training school at Butwal
(1.2%)
4.10         The SDC (3.4%) and ODA (7.8%) financed components include short and long-term
inputs. The short-term inputs include: establishment of a Road Sector Slklls Manager position in the
Road Sector Skldls Development Unit (RSSDU) in DOR to coordinate and manage road sector traimng
for the Project (1.2%), and establish and organize on-the-job management training for DOR's staff and
a small training/stdy exercise to include visits by a few key Nepalese officials to other countries to assess
institutional options to manage road networks including road authorities and government deparments
(0.4%). In the long term, the main inputs would be: (a) contractor training in cyclic maintenance
operations (1.6%); (b) bridge management to establish systems for managing and maintaining the bridges
of the strategic road network (1.3%); (c) geotechnical and environmental engineering to establish sound
road side support praces in DOR (1.4%); (d) improved plant operations to increase the conmmercial
orientation of two heavy equipment divisions with a view to increase private sector participation in road
maintenanc plant ownesip (1.3%); (e) road safety to develop and support a national road safety
strategy (through DOTM) (1.4%); and (f) the development of the Strengthened Maintenance Division to
improve routine and recurrent mainance operations (2.6%).
4.11         Rad NanUa=  andlrmormation          . A system is being developed by MRCU with
donor support. During appraial DOR/MRCU agreed to address suggested changes to the action plan
to idenfy, procure an  install available software packages to support the central road infornmaon
module, mainten        progrmming module, and road system performance monitoring module, in
preferene to in-house development of the system. The revised MRCU program is expected to enable
key capability for local management, network-level programming, and system-level policy review to be
achievd in a basic sustainable form within about two years. Financing for this component was confirmed
by ODA and SDC during negotiations.



- 16 -
(b) M_ainenance and Rehabilitton Progms
4.12         The naintenance components to be financed by IDA would include: (a) support for a
backlog periodic maintenance program of roads and bridges of the strategic road network in the Central,
Western, Mid-Western and Far-Western regions including about 500 km of resealing, 150 km of
gravelling and sealing, and minor bridge repairs (21% of the Project cost); (b) rehabilitation and over'ays
of 300 km of selected highways and 130 kn of feeder roads of the strategic road network (27%); and
(c) a pilot labor-based district road rehabilitation and maintenance component to support rehabilitation
and maintenance of 140 kan in 4 selected districts and promotion of app:opriate rural transport technology
to encourage community participation in rvad maintenance and related activities (4.4%). The Government
would fund the gradual development of a comprehensive routine maintenance program by contract
(7.9%).
4.13         In the course of Project preparation, DOR with assistance from specialists, has identified
the rehabilitation activities and the program of maintenance activities on the basis of the Bank's Highway
Design and Mainteance Standards Model (HDM-I), economic criteria, and the available data base.
The maintenance strategy for the strategic network (4,000 km of highways and feeder roads)
recommends: (a) pavement rehabilitation of road sections that have reached or exceeded their lifetime
tirough asphalt overlays; (b) resurfacing works of paved road sections which would otherwise require
extensive rehabilitation through surface treatment or thin asphalt overlays depending on traffic levels (or
regravelling in the case of gravel surface road sections and sealing those sections where it is economically
feasible); (c) routine maitenance works including local repair of roadway and pavement, grading of
unpaved surfaces and shoulders, regular mainnce of road drainage, side slopes, verges, traffic control
devices, and furniture, roadside cleaning, dust and vegetation control. and maintaining safety
appurtenances; and (d) emergency maintenance works including clearing landslides, river training works
and repair of drainage structhres. The rehabilitation component would cover the needs of the strategic
highway network. The surface treatments recommended in the multi-year program of resealing,
gravelling and sealing is based on data available at appraisal and is expected to be refined and reviewed
anually as analytical capabilities are inproved in DOR/MRCU and the maitenance information systems
are implemented.
4.14         Rehabilitation of 300 km of Hifhwavs and 130 km of Feeder Roads. (Map No. IBRD
24777) A program of rehbilitation of 300 km of strategic highways was prepared in the course of
Project preparation based on an initia prioritization by DORIMRCU, followed by detailed surveys,
economic analysis and an application of the HDM-l model adapted to local conditions. A limnited
program of rehabilitation of 130 km of strategic feeder roads was recommended for inclusion in the
rebabilitationprogramby NPC, which was further analyzed based on detailed surveys, economic analysis
and an application of the HDM-M model. The detailed field surveys indicate that all highway and feeder
road sections selected are in poor condition, with high indices of road roughness (International Roughness
Index (IR1) of roughness averaging somewhere between 7.0 to 12.6 mi/kn) in most cases. Severe
pavement distress were found to be frequent. The rehabilitation program was developed comparing
alternative appropriate tecbniques (ranging from asphalt overlays to complete reconstruction of pavement,
or regravelling) and embodies an optimm rehabilitation and maintenance strategy including mostly
asphaltic overlays for strengthening, drainage improvements and minor widenings, or regravelling to be
carried out during FY 94-97. The rehabilitation component of the Project includes six sections of
strategic highways and three sections of strategic feeder roads in the Central and Western regions (Annex
4). This component includes civil works (base costs of US$ 22.8 million) and construction supervision
(base costs US$ 2.2 million).
4.15         Support for Periodic Mainta   of Roads and Bridges. A prioritization of the strategic
network periodic mantnce was conducted based on available data. A periodic maintenance program
was prepared based on pavement condition surveys, economic analyses and use of the HDM-Il model.
The periodic maintenan  program includes surface treaunents (single or double) for paved sections and



- 17 -
gravelling and sealing of unpaved sections of the strategic highway network. (See Map IBRD No. 24779).
The periodic maintenance program to adress the needs of the strategic network between FY 95-98 and
agreed with NPC and DOR includes resealing of 500 km and gravelling ad sealing of 150 kan of roads
in Central, Western, Mid-Westen and Far-Western regions of Nepal. The scope of the annual
maintenmce programs, as deailed in Annex 3, would increase gradually to a level commensurate with
the average annual requirements of the network. The program includes 114 kn in FY 94/95, 160 kan
in FY 95/96, 175 km in FY 96/97 and 160 mn in FY 97198. In the course of preparation, detailed
surveys, economic analyses, and bidding documents have been prepared for the first year periodic
mainance program.
4.16         The civil works of this Project component (base costs of US$ 23.9 million) include: (a)
IDA financed backlog resealing of 500 Ian, gravelling and sealing of 150 kn and minor bridge repairs
(US$ 11.6 million) and consulting services for design and supervision (US$ US$ 1.2 million), (c) ODA
financed cyclic resealing training contracts on about 300 km to be identified (US$ 5.1 million), and (d)
IDA financed road maintenance equipment to be hired to domestic contractors for surface dressing
operations through DOR's equipment divisions and supervision vehicles (base costs of US$ 3.6 million)
(details in Amex 12). The maintenance and operation of the equipment would be financed by DOR with
the proceeds from the equipment hire according to the rates agreed to during negotiations. The field
implementtion advisers to assist DOR's management, will be an integral part of this component. HMG
and SDC would support the gradual development of rouine matenance (introducing on a pilot basis
lengthman or gang sytem by contract) for 2,000 kan of sategic road network (para. 4.21). Since the
magnitude of the maintenance works needed to reduce the bacldog of periodic maintenance of strategic
roads is subsantial, and in the interest of ensuring good quality works with a gradually increasing
maintenance budget and to encourage the inroduion of appropriate cost-efficient road maienance
tecnologies, IDA would assist in financing periodic mntnance.
4.17         Durng negotiations agreement was reached on the scope of the periodic maintenance
progam and the proposed phasing of the resealing, and gravelling and sealing components. The first
year program deis, with costs and treatments selected (para 5.14), were finalized at appraisal. The
programs for the remaining years FY 96-98 would be reviewed and updated annually within the scope
of the program and treatments selected (Annex 3) and agreed to during negotiations, as information is
updated, and economic and enironental analyses are finalized.
4.18         Expansion of DOR's maintenance capabilities to the regions/divisions, especially to
monitor and supervise an increasing mmiber of periodic and routine maintance comracts, would require
substantial assistance on technical and managerial issues, especially in three areas: road maintenance
enginering, equipment management and quality control. With increased funding for road maintenance
during the Project, I)OR would need assistance to improve the efficiency of road maintenance operations
against well defined makienance targets. Assistance to DOR's management, specifically for this Project
component would include, in addition to consultant services for supervision, the services from the field
implemenation advisers to: (a) assist the Regional Directors and Divisional Engineers in the development
of efficient road maintenan  operations, equipment management and quality control through assistance
to management and on-the-job training, (b) review regularly the performance of contractors and
consultants in charge of maitenance contracts, (c) identify training needs of Project staff, and (d) provide
assistance in the preparation of annual maintnance programs in each region based on the central and
regional level priorities established by the DOR/MRCU.
4.19         The scope of the field implementation advisory capacity was agreed upon during appraisal
and the TOR finalized during negotiations (Annex 2). The services to be conacted from a consulting
firm would consist of the following resident specialists: (a) Road Mantenance Specialist with shared
responsibilities for Centa, Western Mid-Western and Far-Western regions (4.5 expatiate staff years
and provision for 2 additional expatriate staff years increased capacity is necessary during FY 1995/96
and FY 1996/97); (b) Quality Control Experts/Materials Engineer (0.4 expatriate staff year and 12.8 staff



- 18 -
years of local experts) with shared responsibilities for all regions to establish a sound quality control
system for road mai ance activities through advice and on-the-job training of district engineers and
local consultants; (c) Operations Adviser on resealing, gravelling and equipment (1 expatriate staff year,
and 6 staff years of local experts) with shared responsibilities in the Hetauda and Butwal Equipment
Divisions) to assist DOR in establishing a reliable hire system for the Project equipment at Hetauda and
Butwal. During negotiations, agreement was reached on short term and long term inputs financed by
SDC and ODA to assist DOR in the preparation of fonnal training. A seminar to finalize the scope of
services of the RSSDU to be financed by SDC and ODA and its coordination with the Project took place
before negotiations in Kartmdu.
4.20         The field implementation advisers (assistance to management) for this Project component
would be attached to the Regional Directors under the Maintenance Section of DOR. Each advisor would
bave a region-specific posting. The responsibilities of the specialists would be defined against the
physical implementation program, with regular evaluations of performance including a mid-term contract
review. In general, the advisers are expected to assist DOR management to remove existing
implementation and management coraints.
4.21         Routine Maintenance. The exclusive relie on force account for routine maintenance
should be discourged during the Project. It was agreed that the introduction of routine maintenance by
cotract should take place gradually and be supported during the Project. The Project would support the
ncessaiy technical assistance (local consultants) to implement routine maitenance contracts which will
be funded by HMG in the districts included in the periodic maintenance component. The introduction
of routine maintenc by contract on a pilot basis strted in FY 1993/94 in 2 SMDs and would expand
to about 14 divisions (about 30 districts) in 1997/98 (Annex 5). This component would include technical
assistance financed by SDC (base costs US$ 1.5 million), and routine maintenance works financed by
HMG (US$ 5.9 million).
4.22         Pilot Labor^Based District Road Rehabilitation and Mn ce Project. The main
objectives of this pilot component would be to: (a) develop small enterprises (contractors) to undertake
road rehabilitation and maitnc works with appropriate labor-based techniques involving trained labor
and small equipmt in lieu of the traditional heavy equipment; (b) develop sustainable local skills in rural
areas in low-cost road mantnance which in the future can be contracted by local agencies in the routine
mainenance of rural roads; (c) develop commuity participation in infrastructure maintenance; (d)
promote appropriate rural transport technology to make effective use of road investments; (e) support the
gradual transfer of responsibilities for district roads in four pilot districts to the concemed DDCs and
develop a sustainable institutional frameworkc for district road operations as a pilot program; and (f)
prepare the way for a future integrated rural transport project.
4.23         The pilot labor-based Project cmponent would support the rehabilitation and maitenance
of about 140 km of district roads (See Map IBRD No. 24778), procure about 8 sets of small equipment
to regravell district roads and vehicles for supervision, and develop a training program for small
enterprises (contractors) and road users groups in labor-based road rehabilitation. This component
includes civil works, equipment and vehicles (i.e., 2 four-wheel drive (DRSDU), 4 single-cabin pickups
(1 for each DDC engineer) and 8 motorcycles for the overseer staff (DDC) involved in supervision) to
be financed by IDA (base cost US$ 3.1 million), consulting services for supervision to be financed by
IDA (US$ 0.15 million) and tecenical assistance and training to be financed by UNDP (US$1 million).
In addition, the pilot project will have a small componet to introduce suitable vehicle adaptations for
rural transport, particularly promotion of low-cost 'bicycle trailers' which can be .sily attached to (or
deached from) bicycles to carry goods in the load-range of 100- 150 kgs on rural roads; there is presently
no appropriate rural vehicle for this parcel size in Nepal, between the bicycle carrying about 50 kgs and
a tracw or cart carryi    1 to 2 tons (US$ 0.025 million). These trailers can also be pushed or pulled
as carts in lieu of head-poterage; some adaptations can also be used as "rural ambulances" to carry sick
people to rral health centers, targeted to assist the poor.

4.24           The main features of tbis Project component are the appropriate mix of small equipment
with labor and the introduction of training for contractors and supervisors in improved management
techniques. This is a departure from the traditional method of using expensive heavy equipment or large
labor gangs in labor-intensive works without proper management or training. The result of the new
method will be lower unit costs for road rehabilitation, encouragement to the road contracting industry,
increased employment (each contractor with about US$ 80,000 worth of equipment employing about 120
people daily producing about 2 kn of high quality road rehabilitation every month), and an improved
rural economy. The pilot labor-based Project component is based on successful experience in many other
countries.
4.25           The scope of the rehabilitation program  under this component, agreed to during
negotiations, includes 140 km of district roads which have been selected based consultation with DDCs,
simplified pre-screening based on criteria for suitability for the progran, social and economic factors,
and economic feasibility analyses. (Annex 6) During preparation detailed design and final feasibility
analyses were completed for 40 km. During negotiations it was agreed that final feasibility and
environmental screening for the remnng 100 km selected would be prepared during implementation.
C. Prolect Cost and &handng
4.26           The total cost of the Project is about US$ 69.0 million base cost; adding the physical
(8%) and price contingencies (9%), the total cost would be about US$ 81.1 million. The foreign
exchange component, local component (excl. taxes) and the tax component of the total cost are estimated,
respectively, at about US$ 45.8 million (57%), US$ 31.8 million (39%) and US$ 3.4 million (4%). The
base costs include US$ 20.7 million for rehabilitation, US$ 25.3 million for periodic maintenance, US$
4.2 million for the pilot labor-based component, US$ 10.8 million for the institutional strengthening and
training component, and US$ 7.4 million for routine maintenance. Annual rates of inflation and exchange
rates for local and foreign costs are detailed in Annex 8. Cost estimates for maintenance works are based
on engineering estimates of costs for the rehabilitation, first year of the periodic maintenance, and the
pilot component. Cost estimates for consultant services are based on prevailing local and foreign man-
month rates. The summary costs are included in Table 2, and the detailed costs of the various
components are in Annex 8.

4.27         The Project would be financed from the proposed IDA Credit amounting US$ 50.5
million (62.3% of the Project cost), HMO's own resources for US$ 14.5 million (17.8%), a grant from
UNDP amounting to US$ 1.0 million (1.2%). and contributions from ODA amounting to £ 9.6 (15.3%)
and SDC amounting to SWR 4.3 million (3.4%). For the IDA-financed conponents, the Association will
finance 90% of the cost of rehabilitation, 90% of the cost of periodic maintenance, 100% of the
supervisory technical assistance and equipment, and 100% of the specialists for institutional strengthening
and training components (including the training contracts in the pilot labor-based component).
4.28         ODA and SDC confirmed during negotiatons that they will finance in parallel part of the
insdtutional strengthening and training components of the Project, and agreements have been signed for
the ODA contribudon and are being finalized with SDC. UNDP informed IDA during negotiations that
they are finalizing arrangements to finance the technical assice proposed for the pilot labor-based
district road rehabilitation component.
4.29         HMG's share of the total Project cost would include about US$ 1.9 million in recurrent
costs and US$ 6.4 million in routine maintenance. As mentioned above, in order to ensure adequate,
timely and reliable funding for road maintenance from HMG, the Project has two main policy initiatives
including: (a) establishment of a road maintenance funding mechanism, and (b) agreement on annual
allocations for road sector expenditu  (including maintenance) and annual targets for maintenance
funding based on a rolling 3-year plan. The implications for Project financing are described belcw.
4.30         Road Maintence nam ding Mechanism. DOR and MOF have increased allocations for
road maintenance in the budget for FY 1993/94 to NRs 230 million for recurrent and routine
maintenance. Following the approval of guidelines and procedures for the revolving fund based on toll
taxes MOP, a mechanism has been established to provide timely, reliable funds for road maintenance.
DurM negotiations, ageements were reached on the timetable to expand the revolving fund concept into
a Road Maintenance Fund during Project implementation. The MOWT has already prepared a draft Bill
for the Road Maintenance Fund, to be considered by Parliament before March 31, 1994. During
MgW_Uons, the Government agreed to further develop the guidelines and procedures (already approved
for the revolving fund) to support the functioning of the Road Mainenance Fund once it is established
(on or about July 31, 1994); NPC has already prepared a draft of the expanded guidelines and
procedures for the satisfactory operation of the Fund, which have been forwarded for IDA's review and
comments before negodadons. Agreements were reached with EMG durine negotiations on: (a)
establishnt of the Road Ma_intnance Fund during FY 1994/95; (b) onfrmation that maintenance
would be financed from a share of road user charges; (c) confinnation that m ance allocations will
be transferred regularly to a DOR account for payments against maintenance contracts; (d) agreement to
have quarterly estimates of Project and global mamienance expenditures in periodic and routine
mntenance activities; (e) agreement to conduct an operational audit of maintenance activities in 1995
and 1997; and (e) agreement that counterpart funding requirements for the Project would be estimated
quarterly and met promptly.
4.31         Annual Sectoral Ceiings and Maintenance TarWets. In FY 1991/92, road sector
allocations and expndiurs amounted to NRs 2.5 and 2.2 billion (US$ 50 and 44 million equivalent)
respectively, including 38% of exenditures for rehabilitation and 6% for maintenance. In FY 1992/93,
road sector allocations and estimated expenditures anunted to NRs 2.9 and 2.4 billion (US$ 63 and 52
million equivalent), respectively, including only 3% for maintenance. Allocations for FY 1993/94 are
estimated at about NRs 2.5 billion (US$ 51.0 million equivalent). Agreenent was reached during
ngotia   with HMG on road sector allocation and expenditure ceilings averaging about US$ 70 million
equivalent over the next three years, with a share (increasing from 10% to 15%) earmarked for periodic
and routine road minenance. Agreme  was reached with HMG on annual budgetary allocations for
routine and periodic madntenance as detailed in Annex 9.



- 21 -
4.32         Routine m   an      for the strategic network (based on MRCU/DOR prionties to be
reviewed annually during Project implementation) would be established with a 12 month lag in each
division included in the resealing component. Annex 5 includes estimates of the routine maintenance
requirements by district (2-4 districts in one division). Based on this gradual introduction of routine
maintenance, the benchmarks for minium increases in routine and emergency maintenance have been
established as follows: for FY 1994195, an addidonal NRs 40 million; for FY 1995196, an additional
NRs 63 million; for FY 1996/97, an additional NRs 103 million; and for FY 1997/98, an additional NRs
153 million.
4.33         Retroactive Financing. In order to finance advance procurement actions for the phase
1 road rehabilitation program, the Government could request up to US$1.2 million in retroactive
financing for expenditures made after August 31, 1993. Retroactive financing will be used for consulting
services and civil works for the road rehabilitation component if the government decides to take advance
procurement action.
D. ProLect Environmental Imact
4.34         The Project is not likely to have any significant adverse effects on the environment.
Existing road alignments will be followed to the extent technically feasible, and any deviations are
expected to be minor. A Sectoral Environental Assessment (SEA) has been undertaken to develop a
simple, stndard and practical screening of Project components, every year of the Project for review by
IDA, with a view to strengthen environnental considerations in the design and construction stages of all
DOR projects (Annex 13). DOR would establish an environmental unit and appoint a senior engineer
to head the unit witbin its Planning Section, by May 31, 1994, date after wbich the sector environmental
action plan would start being implemented. Provisions will be incorporated in design and bidding
documents. It was agreed during negotiations with HMG that the SEA would be adopted by March 31,
1994, for purposes of screening the road programs of each years program. The environmental unit would
conduct an environmenl screening of each annul periodic road maintenance program, according to the
SEA Guidelines, and a specific screening of the three feeder roads included in phase 2 of the
rehabilitation program and the Galyang-Chapakot road in the pilot labor-based component, for review by
iDA before requesting the consultants to start preparing detailed feasibility and designs.
E. Eco_noc Evaluaton and Sensitivity Analvsis
4.35         The main objective of the Project is to reduce the total cost of road transport in Nepal's
strategic road network. The economic evaluation was prepared for four separate components: 300 kn
of rehabilitation of strategic highways, 130 kn of rehabiltation of strategic feeder roads, 650 km of
periodic mantenan   of strategic highways and feeder roads, 140 kan of rebabilitation of district roads.
4.36         Ptoject Benefits. The Project's main benefit would be more efficient, cost effective
administation of the road transport system, prioritization of sector expenditures and reduction of transport
costs. Strengthening DOR would create a central focal point which will offer technical support and
assistance to local authorities in the future. The benefits of a road improvement component under the
Project consists of savings in vehicle operating costs and cost savings in maintenance. The economic
benefits of the Project indicate that the overall economic rate of return, as well as that of individual
components, would exceed the opportnity cost of capital. The benefits for the institutional strengthenin
and training components are high but non-qanifiable.
4.37         Economic Evaluation.  The economic analysis of the rehabilitation and periodic
mainrtece of strategic highways was done based on an application of The World Bank's Highway
Design and Mantenan  Standards Model (HDM-f). The economic evaluation of the district road (low-
volume roads) reabilaion component was based on an application of the rural road appraisal



- 22 -
methodology developed by the Bank, which estimates agricultural producer surplus (See details in Annex
11).
4.38         The economic evaluation of the 300 kIn of rehabilitation of strategic hinhwavs was
prepared by international consultants using The World Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance
Standards Model (HDM-Ill) and the recently developed HDM Manager calibrated for Nepal's conditions.
The Economic Rate of Return (ERR) for this component is 19.4% which is substantially higher than the
opportunity cost of capital.
4.39         In the case of the 130 km of rehabilitation of strategic feeder roads, the economic
evaluation was prepared during appraisal by local and expatriate consultants based on an application of
the HDM-U and the HDM Manager with partial data from field condition surveys. Even though the
ERR for this component (10.4%) is slightly higher than the opportunity cost of capital, final feasibility
analyses and envirormental screenig would be requested from the consultants for each road included in
this component, to be reviewed as part of the annual reviews by IDA during the Project.
4.40         The economic evaluation of the 650 km of periodic maintenance of strategic highways
and feeder roads was prepared by local and expatriate consultants based on an application of HDM-r
and the HDM Manager, with field data surveys and using model calibrated for Nepal's conditions. The
road sections proposed for this component are part of the strategic highway network, and were selected
based on a matrix analysis that priorifized roads according to average annual daily traffic (AADT),
roughness (IRD) and surface distress index (SDI). The resulting ERR for this Project component is 29%
which is substantially higher than the opportunity cost of capital. The economic feasibility of the second,
third and fourth year programs would be updated annually to incorporate revised costs and condition
surveys. The updated feasibility analyses and environmental screening for each annual program will be
reviewed anmnally with IDA.
4.41         In the case of the 140 kIn of district road rehabilitation, a group of local consultants
prioritized the network of district roads in four districts with the help of local organizations. After, 100
kn of priority district roads were selected for further analysis. The economic evaluation of these 100
kcm, based on the producer surplus appraisal methodology which has been developed by the Bank,
indicates that the ERR for this component is 36%. The inclusion of the rehabilitation/upgrading of the
Galyang-Chapakot road would require detailed feasibility analysis and environmntal screening for IDA's
review before proceeding with design and preparation of bidding documents.
4.42         The overall ERR for the Project is 21.4%. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the
Project will remain viable if base costs increase 10% and benefits dropped by the same proportion.
F. Iroilect Ris
4.43         At the policy level, the main risks are that the Government will bow to political pressures
in developing it's Priority Investment Plan (PIP) and the related three year rolling sectoral funding
programs. To counter this possibility, the PIP must be satisfactory to IDA (and to the other Donors in
the sector), with annIal agreement on the updated rolling investment/maintenance programs and
maienance allocations. Additionally, the Government must establish a mechanism for funding periodic
emergency and routine maintenance of the road network.
4.44         The main risks for the infrastructural aspects of the project are delays in implementation
and a failure to implement optimal comprehensive maintnce programs. To ensure a prompt start up
of the project, supervisory consultants will be appointed in May 1994, (as will key advisors and
counterpart staff), for road maintenance and rehabilitadon, implementaion of the sector environmental
action plan and for the mechanics and operators training programs. To mitigate against risks of
implementing a sub-opimal maintenance program, the supervising consultants will work closely with



- 23 -
DOR's staff in preparing, tendering and implementing the anmnal work programs. Relevant specialists
will also be available under the institutional development component to provide assistance, particularly
on strategic aspects of the rolling programs. By relating the project to the Government's PIP and annual
development plans with particular emphasis upon maintenance and rehabilitation, the scope of project
works has the flexibility to respond to the implementation experience gained during the early years of the
project. Through the process and planned periodic reviews, alternative approaches can be adopted if
appropriate.
4.45         On the institutional aspects of the project, the main risks are the Government's reluctane
to give DOR the autonomy to reorganize it's operations to focus only on trunk roads, overdependence
upon the consultants' providing technical assistance and a lack of accountability and motivation on the
part of DOR staff. To promote the development of local capabilities, DOR staff will be integral members
of the various technical assistance teams and one of the first task of consultants and advisors will be to
prepare detailed plans for the training of counterpart staff and the gradual transfer of responsibilites from
the consultant to the counterpart staff. Various safeguards, including criteria for counterpart selection,
target handover dates for key responsibilities, operational audits and planned periodic reviews have been
incorporated into the institutional developmen programs in an effort to monitor overall implementaton.
Coinued close cooperation among donors in the sector and carefil monitoring by IDA through project
supervision and an indepth mid-term project review with HMG/DOR in October 1995 will firther help
to minimize the risks.
V. RQMJECT IeLEMETATION
5.1          The Project is expected to be fillly implemented within six years.
A. Status of Proiect Prefaron
5.2          The Project preparation activites have adhered to schedules agreed during pre-appraisal.
The bidding documents for the phase 1 rehabilitation conas, first year periodic maintenance contracts,
and model road and trial road contacts of the pilot labor-based component are ready for tender. Tenders
are expected to be called for the phase 1 rehabilitation program in February 1994. The consultants for
supervision and key advisers for the IDA financed components are expected to be appointed on or before
May 15, 1994. Durin  ngotiat    ODA informed that the specialist consultants for the cyclic
maintenance, bridge management, ge-environment and road safety Project components is expected to
be approved by DOR by May 31, 1994. The Terms of Reference for the consultants, advisers and key
studies were agreed and finalized during negotations and are included in Annexes 2, 7, 13, 14 and 16.
Detailed description of the status of Project preparation is included in Amnexes 4, 5, and 6.
B. OrManoza lio na
5.3          DOR would be the main agency responsible for Project implementation; officials in
different DOR units wil be responsible for individual components. The DOR would be responsible for
implemenation of institutional stregthenig; human resource development activities and training for
tnmk road mainte      would be coordinated through the Road Sector Skdlls Development Unit and its
Manager who will advise DOR's Director General.
5.4          The Project's road rehabilitation components would be under the responsibility of the
Deputy Director, Foreign Coordination Section, while the periodic maitenance of roads and bridges
would be under the Deputy Director, Maintce Secon, implemented through DOR's Regional
Directors and Divisional Engineers. The Priority lnvestment Plan preparation and review process would
be under the responsibility of the Deputy Director, Planning Section, and close coordination would be
sought with Np's Transport Unit. DOR would be assisted by the following core teams of experts and
expatriate advisors: (a) field implementation advisors as part of the periodic maintenance programs to



- 24 -
provide advice and onrthejoF training to DOR staff and contractors on road and bridge maintenance,
quality control, contract managemen, and works programming, (b) road sector skills manager, (c)
consultant teams for supervision of phases 1 and 2 of the rehabilitation prograns, (d) advisors for the
training and institutional development components, and (e) consultant teams for the special studies. The
field implementation advisors team would review designs, conduct training activities, prepare tender
documens, evaluate tenders, ensure timely implementation of Project components and technical assistance
studies, monitor progress and costs and keep a tight control on the Project budget and accounts. A team
of local and foreign road experts is responsible for the preparation of phase 1 rehabilitation programs,
considering economic rates of return based on traffic counts, road condition surveys and desired levels
of service. One team of local and foreign road experts, to be selected every year of the Project, would
prepare and supervise the periodic maintenance program for that year; their services include updating the
economic rates of return based or traffic counts, road condition surveys and desired levels of service,
preparng designs and tender documents, assistmg DOR during tender evaluation and being responsible
for supervision. The matenane information system would continue being implemented by the MRCU
to ensure priortization of maintenance activities and increase accountability of maintenance operations.
5.5          In the case of district roads, a newly created Distict Road Services Development Unit
(DRSDU) anached to the office of the Secretary, MLD, would support decentralizaion of district road
administration during the pilot phase and be responsible for the pilot labor-based district road
rehabilitation and mantenan  component. The technical assistance for this Project component would
be funded by UNDP through MLD, and executed by an International NGO (Helvetas). The civil works
would be financed from the Project, with the Project Manager of DRSDU designated as a signatary to
the Project's special account for this Project component only. The DDCs would let contracts for
rehabilitation and mannance, employ consultants to design and supervise the contracts under the
gidance of the DRSDU, and monitor and evaluate this Project cmone. The training for this Project
component would be at DOR's training facilities at Butwal. The equipment sets to be purchased would
remain the property of the DOR, but would be for hire exclusively to the labor-based contractors under
this Project component. The nural transport component would be implemented through DRSDU.
5.6          Donor Coordination. Active donor coordination during Project preparation has resulted
in one of the fist cofinanced Projects in the sector in Nepal. Donor coordination is expected to be
ensured through arrangements to be set out in a Memorandum of Understanding to be signed by the
cofinanciers. A draft of the Memorandum of Understanding relating to cooperation, coordination and
exchange of information was prepared during negotiations and is expectd to be finalized by May 31,
1994. The coordination would cover joint reviews of sector expenditure prioritization, maintenance
programs and progress with sector policy reform. The trnsport sector coordinator in IDA's resident
mission would also have a main responsibility for local coordination of cofinanciers and would assist
HMG and the cofianciers during preparation of supervision missions, monitoring policy reform actions
and organizing meetings among the cofnanciers in Katunandu.

NEPAL
ROAID MANTINANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
The Conction-Maintenance Tridde-
In Nepal, it has been common for the road mantace budget to be 'raided' to finance the consruction
of new roads. This has happened both at the budget allocation stage in the MOF and also by the
diversion of allocated fwxds locally as a result of political pressure. This trade-off between constuction
and maintenance, and the implication for the road network in Nepal, may be illustrated using a simple
example.
Consider the road network of Nepal which, in round figures, comprises:
- 3,000 km of paved roads; and
- 5,000 kmn of unpaved roads.
If these roads were in good condition, the anmual mantce budget would need to be:
Paved roads at NR 1.56 lakh per km    = NR 46.8 crore
Unpaved roads at NR 1.02 lakhs per n = NR 51.0 crore
NR 97.8 crore
If, instead of reserving this budget for road maintenance, part of it were diverted to new constructon in
order to extend the road network by just one per cent each year, the following results would emerge:
Paved               Unpaved
Annual incse in length                      30 kn                 S0 kn
Annual new construction cost              30.0 crore           25.0 crore
- at NR 1.0 crora paved
- at NR 0.5 crorekan unpaved
Balance of budget remaiig for road        16.8 crore           26.0 crore
Length of road that could be maintined for  1 0077 km         2 549 kn
this residual budget--_
If this construction-maintenance policy were to coninue for ten years, 800 km of new roads would have
been built. However, a lack of maitenance during this period would have rendered 4,374 kn of road



-3 4-
Page 2 of 2
unserviceable because only 3,626 km of road could be maintined correcdy with the residual budget.
The restoration bill for these 4,734 km of road at the end of ten years can be determind from the
following.
______________________               _  [   Paved                  Unpaved
Length requiring rehabltation            1 923 kmn                2451 km
Assumed average restoration cost per     56.25 laklh              5.75 lakh
kilometer (NRs)                             ____ ______
Tot restoration cost (NRs)               1 081 crore               141 crore
Thus, over a ten year period, the road network would suffer a net reduction of 3,574 Ia: a gain of 800
kn of new roads, as against a loss of 4,374 km of existng roads through lack of maintenance. The total
cost of restoration would be NRs 1,222 crore ($284 million), which is remarkbly similar to the current
estimate of the restoration bacikog in Nepal.
This analysis assumes that the funds available for mantenance would be concated on a restricted
length of 3,626 km. If the funds were, instead, spead across the entire network, the loss of serviceable
roads is likely to be even greater. The current policy of construction and ta   funding ifi Nepal
may be considered against this background.

ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
INSTITUTIONAL STRENGTHENING FINANCED BY IDA UNDER THE RMRP
1.    The institutional strengthening and training component of the Road Maintenance and
Rehabilitation Project has been designed to support the Project's objectives. Within the four years of the
Project the Component will have strengthened the Departnt of Roads' maintenance capabilities,
implemented a progran of institutional strengthening and strengthened the capacity of the local contract
industry.
2.    Several training programs are proposed to be financed under the Project. These are divided into
the programs required for the immediate needs of the Project and for the development needs of the
Department.
3.    Programs required for the immediate needs of the Project will provide: (a) field implementation
advisers for the DOR and contactors on periodic maintenance activities; (b) training for local contractors
in contact biddig procedures and operations for periodic maintenance; and (c) technical assistance and
limited training for contractors on road rehabilitation contracts.
4.    Programs designed to meet the development needs of the Deparanent to be financed mainly by
IDA, SDC, ODA and UNDP include: (a) management and technical training for the Department's staff
(SDC and ODA); (b) visits to other road agencies; (c) training for District Development Committees and
small contractors in labour-based rehabilitation technology for local roads in support of the policy of
increasing the role of Districts in infrastructure maintenance (UNDP); (d) strengthening support will be
given to the Department's Mechanics and Operators Training Center to increase the range and
effectiveness of the training given (IDA); (e) support for Strengthened Maintenance Divisions (SDC) to
undertake network planning and coordinate work on the strategic network; (f) training in periodic
miaintenance management, contracts and work methods for the Departnent's staff, consultants and
contractors (ODA); (g) establishing a bio-engineering capacity, a bridge management system (including
special requirements for the Karnali Bridge) and a plant management system in the Department (IDA and
ODA); (h) establishing a road safety program in Nepal (ODA).
5.    Wherever possible existing local resources should be used, augmented where necessary by
expatriate inputs.
6.    Central to this Project component is the establishment within the DOR of a Road Sector Skills
Manager, in the Road Sector Skil Development Unit, reporting to the Director General. The Road
Sector Skdlls Manager will provide advice and assistance to the Department as well as to other
components of the Project. The Manager will provide coordination and limited management for the
institutional strengthening and training components, especially ensuring the training meets professional
standards.
7.    The Road Sector Skills Manager will be resourced to undertake actions approved by a Steering
Committee representing the Ministry of Works and Transport, the Ministry of Finance, the National
Planning Committee, funding agencies and the Director General of Roads.



- 36 -
Annex 2
Page 2 of 27
8.    It is proposed that the Road Sector Skills Manager be assisted by a training adviser.
9.    Linkages will be established with existing training providers to provide certificated training
wherever possible. These providers will be asked to administer training programs specific to the needs
of the Departnent. These programs will be part of a process of systematic staff development that will
continue after the Project.
10.   The following actions are recommended to implement the IDA funded components of the
institutional strengthening and training component of the RMRP: (a) IDA and other funding agencies to
fonralize a Coordination Committee among donors in the sector as soon as possible; (b) IDA, and other
funding agencies, and the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Road Maintenance, to form an Institutional
Development Steering Committee as soon as possible; (c) DOR to invite proposals from consulting firms
for the team of Field Implementation Advisers; (d) DOR to explore with the supervision consultants of
the phase I rehabilitation contracts the inclusion of training for contractors on the rehabilitation contracts;
(e) DOR to engage the Filed Implementation Advisors according to Terms of Reference (Appendix)
before May 15, 1994.
OBJECTIVES
i1.    The institutional strengthening and training component of the RMRP has two objectives: (a)
immediately to augment and expand the existing capacity of the DOR, contractors and consultants to meet
the needs of the physical investment components of the RMRP; and (b) over several years to develop the
capacity of the DOR to manage the road network.
12.   An underlying objective is to foster an awareness of the need for change. This should evolve
over several years as a result of the strengthening and training efforts in the RMRP.
STRATEGY
50.   The recommended strategy for Institutional Development agreed during appraisal and confirmed
during negotiations is to: (a) strethen the DOR initially while studying the possibility for future
reform; (b) developing field implementation capabilities; (c) focus the DOR on the main road network
and decentralize district roads; (d) remove constraints to staff development.
13.   Initial strengthening should be completed within the period of the RMRP. The PAP Workshop
of 1993 has recommended the reform study with a view to explore the advantages of an independent
roads authority.
14.   The strategy recommended for staff training and development is similar to that for Institutional
Development: (a) strengthen the DOR initally; (b) coordinate the training with the institutional
strengthening process, recognizing the interdependence of the two processes.

IMMEDIATE INTERVENTONS
A. CONTRACTOR TRAINING FOR PERIODIC MAINTENANCE
15.   Review. HMGIN has a policy to stimulate the domestic road contracting industry. As part of this
policy the DOR intends to enhance the ability of contractors to bid for local and international contracts
in periodic maintenance of paved and gravel roads. This will be done under the RMRP.
16.   This will build on work already begun by SDC in Nepal when a recent course on contract
procedures was strongly supported by over 80 contactors and on work by IDA in the Flood
Rehilitation Program. The SDC will continue this course (with specific reference to periodic
maintenance for DOR contracts) under the RMRP. The IDA will support training in field operations and
techniques to ensure the backlog of rehabilitation and resurfacing work can be reduced.
17.   Objective. The objective for this component will be to support the development of a local
contractor industry by:
a. Training contractors to understand contract documents and prepare bids.
b.  Training contractors in field operations.
18.   The training objective will be achieved by training contractors wanting to bid for periodic
maintenance contracts under the RMRP, by training successful bidders in field operations on site and by
supporting the Contractors' Association of Nepal.
19.   Trainina process. The training will be given in three stages:
a. Training as part of the ODA funded contracts on contract documentation and bidding procedures.
Where appropriate this training will be provided in the Nepalese language;
b. Assistance to contractors as they prepare their bids (except for pricing).
c.  Training of managers and supervisors on the work site from mobilization through to making the
final claim, as part of the ODA financed training contracts and through the input of the Field
Implementation Advisers (TOR enclosed attached).
B. FED    IMPLEMENTATION ADVIERS FOR PERIODIC MANTEANCE ACTIVITIES
20.   There is a heavy progrm of work to reduce the backlog of periodic maintenance under the
RItRP. In the first year it will involve 114 kmns in three regions, increasing to 160 kns in three regions
in the second year, 175 knis in four regions in the third year and 160 kns in four regions in the fourth
year. This requires technical assistance to be provided to the DDG (Maintenance) and Divisional
Engineers. It is proposed to be funded by IDA.
21.   The intention is to provide assistance and training to management staff of te DOR and on the
job training to local contractors and associated consultants.
22.   The Field Implementation Advisers (FIA) will develop systems and procedures for maintenance
that reflect current DOR requirements.



- 38 -
Annex 2
Page 4 of 27
23.    Management. Over the period of the RMRP there will one expatriate consultant engaged as road
maintenance engineer (increased mput to be considered during the mid-term review) and two local
consultants engaged as assistant road maintenance engineers.
24.    The advisors will form a team under the management of the road maintenance engineer to:
a.  assist the management of DOR in monitoring the bacldog periodic maintenance program under
the RMRP;
b. develop management, quality and financial control systems for contract implementation and
regularly assess progress and performance of consultants and contractors;
c. provide on the job training to contractors and DOR staff and consultants involved in
implementation of the backlog periodic maintenance program; and
d. assist the DDG (Maintenance) and Divisional Engineers prepare quarterly reports assessing
contraul matters, evaluating proposals from contractors and consultants and developing
solutions to implemention problems.
25.    Subject to review at the time it is envisaged that one road maitenance engineer will be full-time
for the project duration, with additional input if required to join the team in 1995-96 and 1996-97 as the
work load increases. One assistant engineer will be fill-time from the beginning of the 1994-95 year
until the completion of the project, the second full-time for 1996-97 and 1997-98.
26.    Oualitv control.  There will be up to two local consultants and up to two staff seconded from
DOR engaged as quality control advisers in the Field Implementation Advisors staff to advise DOR. They
will ensure the quality control system is being properly followed by laboratory staff. It is expected that
two advisers will be engaged for a total of 21 months in the year 1994-95, three advisers full-time in
1995-96 and four fuUl-time in both 1996-97 and 1997-98.
27.   One materials engineer wiUl be engaged for short-term visits in each of the first three years to
review the quality control systems in place, determine appropriate testing procedures and analyze the
training needs of consultants and DOR staff. This person will ensure the work of the quality control
advisers meets the requirements of the quality control system. About five months input is envisaged for
the year 1994-95 and two months in each of the following two years.
28.    Training in operations. An experienced field supervisor will be engaged to work with the
contractors on the work site.
a. The objective of this component will be to train contractors' supervisory staff in mobilization,
resurfacing techniques and site control.
b. The training will be matched to the contract specifications on "training contracts". These will
be similar in all respects to other contracts with specific allowance in the conditions for the
training input.
c. The training will include: mobilizing resources; managing resources during the contract;
controlling quality and progress to meet the contract specifications and programs; completing the
contract; undertaking the maintenance period; road resurfacing techniques for paved roads; road
resurfacing techniques for gravel roads; storing materials and equipment; site management and

AM 
Page 5 of 27
supervision; training woks; imptroving pductivity.
d.  The training will be practical, on the job and direcdy related to the on-going work required to
meet the conta  conditions and specifications.
e.  The field operations supervisor will make sot term inputs during the constucion season. These
will be for about 5 months in 1994-95, 4 months in 1995-96, 3 months in 1996-97 and 2 months
in 1997-98.
29.   The field operations supervisor will make short term hpts durig the construcon season. These
wfll be for about 5 months in each of the years 1994-95 and 1995-96 and three montfs in 1996-97 and
1997-98.
30.   Contc e          .  The scope of work descred for the FIA is suitable for a package for
a local consulting group,         by epatiate advice where needed. The advantages of such a
package include:
a   It would help build loca consultant capacity.
b.  It would provide a more unifom input (tan if consuanwere engaged individually).
c.  lt would be more easily managed by the DOR (than indhiv   inputs).
d. It would assist DOR's management ensure quality, progress and low cost.
31.   Coordimton with &Wfg   MwaiDivisim.
The work of the FIA  must be closely coordina   with the work to strenghe DOR mantenan
divons. The Suengthned Mainenance Divisons (SMD) program is desgned to develop the capacity
of the DOR districts to manage an on-going progrm of periodic, recrrent and routine maitenance for
roads (which can be fully implemen_td one the bacldog of periodic    n   has been removed).
a. If the systems, processes and methods introduced by the FIA are the same (or at least similar)
to those proposed for the SMD the i ple ion effort need not be repeated. Also DOR staff
will not face the confusion of changing from one system to another within a reasonably short
time.
b. The timing of each program should also be coordinated so that there is a logical change in each
dist  from the work of the PIA to the SMD process.
C. TRAIWNIG FOR SMALL CONTRACIORS IN LABOUR-BASED   EHABILITAION OF
DISTRICT ROADS
32.   Review  HMG/N has a policy to pass the maintenac of local roads to DDCs. One objective
of the RMRP is to support the development of small road mantenance conacors using labour-based
methods for the rehabilitation of unsealed district roads.
33.   To achieve this objecdve the Pilot Labour-Based Dist  Road Rehabilitation Project (PLDRR)
will be established in four districts of the Wen Region (IDA) and two distri  in the Eastern Region
(DANIDA).



- 40 -
Annex 2
Page 6 of 27
34.    This Project component is reviewed in detail in Annex 6, and this section only emphasizes the
institutional strengtg and training aspects of the component.
35.    Jain Proce. There will be twelve contractors selected for traiing in the first year of the
PLDRR. At the completion of the training period the eight best contractors will be selected and provided
with equpment on hire for work on a trial road.
36.   There will be two main parts to the program:
a.  training for contractors' managers in the adm on and mamgement of a labour-based
project and for DOR and DDC staff, and local representatives of user commitees will be
provided;
b. training for contractors' supervisors in the site supervision of a labour-based project; DOR and
DDC staff will also attend;
37.   To support the main training:
a.  DOR and DDC staff and local r        es  of user groups will be trined in contract
management;
b. DOR staff will be trained as trainers for the supervisor training;
c.  Contractors' mechanics and operators will be trained.
38.   The details of the curriculum and the traing program are included in the project docwnent
prepared by MULTI Disciplinary Consultants as part of Project preparation.
D. SUPPORT FOR THE MECHANICS AND OPERATORS TRAINING CENTER
39.   The MOTC was established with a World Bank loan in 1983 and further developed by the ODA
in 1986-87. The MOTC has tained 28 (out of 382) operators, 75 (of 224) helpers and 55 (of 104) junior
mechanics. It has not trained any electricians or machinists. This means that a total of 158 people (of a
possible 1012) have been trained.
40.   Survisos and senior mehanics have not been trained. It is reported that, as a result, they have
discouraged the use of new skills by juniors on return to work. They are not able to see the value in the
new methods.
41.   Many mechanics have poor literacy and numeracy skills. This is a significant constraint to
competency becase training and work reuires meaurments and calcuations as well as reference to
written materia.
42.   When staff leave their work site for training at the MOTC they lose their site subsistence
allowance. Some staff have retuned from training at the MOTC to find their places have been taken by
other recruits.
43.   The deifct of taining has been constrained by:



- 41 -
Annex 2
Page 7 of 27
a.  the attitude of supervisors and senior mechanics;
b.  the wide range of equipment, makes and models used in DOR;
c.  the lack of appropriate tools and equiment in some workshops.
d. low literacy and numeracy skills.
44.   Training itself has been constrined by:
a. insufficient operating fiuds;
b.  the lack of machine tools and laboratory equipment for trning;
c.  onbl one instuctor and no dedicated equipment for operator raining;
d.  the fact that most proposed training progras have not been designed yet;
e. reluctance of staff to leave their work place.
45.   The management of the MOTC have prepared an informal paper for discussion outlining their
reommendations for additional support.
46.     IRthag. There is an urgent need to sregthen the MOTC to meet the requiments of this
project and the long term needs of the DOR. IDA will support esse    infrastuctur improvements to
office, training and accommodation faciLities, the design of more training modules, increasing the number
of instructors and purchasig more equipment.
47.    Objectives. The objectives of Support for the MOTC will be to:
a.  stengthen the MOTC to provide the range of training required by the DOR;
b. recommend future directions for the MOTC;
C.  develop the capacity of mechanics and operators to service and operate available eqpment
efficiently.
48.     ingj Ned. The most immediate need apprs to be training for supervisors and senior
mechanics, so that they will:
a. support the development of their staff;
b.  support an equpment maitenance system.
49.   The next importan need is training in litercy and mmwacy skills.
50.   The training will generally be admistred in three stages:
a. the Training Center will be used for the introductory training such as theory and skills;
b.  on-job taini  will relate the introductory training to the acala work situation in workshops and
on work sites; and
c.  on-job assement wfll ensure the traiing has been transferred to the work-place.
51.   Inf u           sng     is required for the MOTC and is likely to be provided as follows:
a.  minim  additional equipment wil be procured for operator and mechanics traing;
b.  residenia accommo on, training and office facilities will be improved; and



- 42 -
PaSe 8 of 27
c.  additional trnig and support staff will be enged.
52.   The management of the MOTC would need to rationalize the assessment of training equipment
needs and prepare a detailed assessment to be financed under the Project for review and commns from
IDA. One isse that must be considered before the final recommendations on tring equipment is
forwarded to IDA could include: (a) the DOR has sufficient heavy equipment in need of overhaul which
could be relocated to the training workshop; (b) instead of purchasing equipment, the provision under the
Project for spare parts could be used to overhaul equipment that could be salvaged at an economic cost;
and (c) options should be examined such as siting the equipment at a depot suitable for operator training
on condition that it be made available for training when required; hiring the equipment out, except when
it is required for traiing.
53.   Use of facilities. The center's facilities wiU also be made available for other training, such as
laboratory tning (using the adjacent DOR laboratory).
54.   Inprut. The support will include a Mechanical Engineer who will liaise with the Equipment
Section DDG and other Divisional Engineers in the Mechanical Branch of DOR. The mechanical
engineer will develop training and present training for workshop and plant managemnt. He will also
liaise with the ongoing support from the MRCU and ODA for establishing strengteed equipment
divisions in the DOR.
55.   An experinced F ceman Mechanic will be engaged to develop and present supervisor and senor
mechanic training and to uevelop other courses as required, then train the existing tutors to present them.
56.   It is expected that most training will commence in the MOTC, but all training will be completed
in the learner's actual workplace to ensure that the training is transferred to the workplace in an
appropiate manner. This completion will include an assessment of competence.
57.   The Foreman Mechanic will also work with DOR mechanical staff where necessary to ensure
that all equipmt used for the RMRP is competently serviced and maintaned.
58.   The Mechanical Engineer will be engaged for a total of 21 months in three periods: (a) starting
in July 15, 1994 for 15 months, (b) starting in October 1996 for three months, and (c) starting in January
1998 for three months. The Foreman Mechanic expatriate will be hired for a total of 30 months in two
periods: (a) starting in July 15, 1994 for 24 months, (b) starting in january 1998 for 6 months. Subject
to the result of a needs assessment by the Mechanical Engineer a local Foreman Mechanic or Operator
trainer will be engaged full-time until the completion of the project.

ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABIITATION PROJECT
TERMS OF REFERENCE
for
FEID IDLEENTATION ADVISORS
OBJECTIVE
1.    The first objective of the institutional strengthemng and tranig component of the RMRP is
immediately to augment and expand the existing capacity of DOR's regional offices and divisions,
contractors and consultants to meet the needs of the physical investnent components of the RMRP.
2.    These Terms of Reference describe the interventions proposed to meet this objective.
FM"D I      AMPLEETATION ADVISERS FOR PERIODIC MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES
3.    The bacldog periodic maitence program under RMRP. In the first year it will involve 114
kms in three regions, increasing to 160 kms in three regions in the second year, 175 kms in four regions
in the third year and 160 kns in four regions in the fourth year. This requires technical assistance to be
provided to the Maitna    Section of DOR and Divisional Engineers, and it is proposed to be funded
by IDA.
4.    The intention is to provide assistance and training to management staff of the DOR and on the
job traing to local contractors and associated consultants.
5.     The Field Implementation Advisers (17A) will develop systems and procedures for maintenance
that reflect current DOR requirements.
6. ManLgeVunt. Over the period of the RMRP there will be one expatriate consultant engaged as road
maintenance engineer (increased input to be discussed during mid-term review) and two local consultants
engaged as assistant road maintenance engnees.
7.     They will form a team under the management of one consultant to:
a.  Assist the management of DOR in monitoring the backlog periodic maintenance program under
the RMRP.
b.  Develop management, quality and finacial control systems for contract implementation and
regularly assess progress and performance of consultants and contractors.
c.  Provide on the job training to contractors and DOR staff and consultants involved in
implementation of the backlog periodic maintenance program.
d.  They will assist the DDW (Maintenance), Regional Directors and Divisional Engineers prepare
quarterly reports assessing contractual matters, evaluating proposals from contractors and
consultants and developing solutions to implementation problems.



- 46 -
Page 12 of 27
8.    Subject to review at the time it is envisaged that one road maintenance engineer will be full-time
for the project duration, with additional input if required to join the team in 1995-96 and 1996-97 as the
work load increases. One assistant engineer will be full-time from the beginning of the 1994-95 year until
the completion of the project, the second full-time for 1996-97 and 1997-98.
9.     Ouality control. There will be up to two local consultants and up to two staff seconded from
DOR engaged as quality control advisers in the Field Implementation Advisors staff to advise DOR. They
will ensure the quality control system is being properly followed by laboratory staff. It is expected that
two advisers will be engaged for a total of 21 months in the year 1994-95, three advisers full-time in
1995-96 and four full-time in both 1996-97 and 1997-98.
10.   One materials engineer will be engaged for short-term visits in each of the first three years to
review the quality conrol systems in place, determine appropriate testing procedures and analyze the
tring needs of consultants and DOR staff. This person will ensure the work of the quality control
advisers meets the requirements of the quality control system. About five months input is envisaged for
the year 1994-95 and two months in each of the following two years.
11.   Train     in opeLrions. An experienced field supervisor will be engaged to work with the
conactors on the work site.
12.   The objective of this component will be to train contractors' supervisory staff in mobilization,
resurfacing techniques and site control.
13.   The training will be matched to the contract specifications on "training contcs". These will
be similar in all respects to other contracts with specific allowance in the conditions for the training input.
14.   The training will include: mobilizing resources; managing resources during the contact;
controlling quality and progress to meet the contract specifications and programs; completing the conract;
undertaking the maintenance period; road resurfacing techniques for paved roads; road resurfacing
techniques for gravel roads; storing materials and equipment; site management and supervision; training
workers; improving productivity.
15.   The taining will be practical, on the job and direcdy related to the on-going work required to
meet the contract conditions and specifications.
16.   The field operations supervisor will make short term inputs during the constuction season. These
will be for about 5 months in 1994-95, 4 months in 1995-96, 3 months in 1996-97 and 2 months in 1997-
98.
17.   Consultancy packge. The scope of work described for the FIA is suitable for a package for
a local consuldng group, strengthened by expatriate advice where needed. The advantages of such a
package include:
a. It would help build local consultant capacity.
b. It would provide a more uniform input (than if consultants were engaged individually).
c.  It would be more easily managed by the DOR (than individual ins).
d. It would assist DOR's management ensure quality, progress and low cost.



- 47 -
Annex 2
Page 13 of 27
18.   Coordination with Strengthened Maintenance Divisions. The work of the FIA must be closely
coordinated with the work to strengthen DOR maintenance divisions. The Strengthened Maintenance
Divisions (SMD) program is designed to develop the capacity of the DOR districts to manage an on-going
program of periodic, recurent and routine maintenance for roads (which can be fully implemented once
the bacldog of periodic m-Aienance has been removed).
19.   If the system, processes and nmthods introduced by the FIA are the same (or at least similar)
to those proposed for the SMD the implementation effort need not be repeated. Also DOR staff will not
face the confusion of changing from one system to another within a reasonably short time.
20.   The tiing of each program should also be ceordinated so that there is a logical change in each
district from the work of the FIA to the SMD process

ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABILJTATION PROJECT
RehabilitaioE Compogn
The scope of the rehabilitation component mcludes six sections of strategic highways including the
following works: (a) Thankot-Naubise (12 kam) - overlay and minor pavement widening to a 6 m. standard
with 0.5 m paved shoulders, exting fhm side drains and providing lay-byes where practicable, lining
of outfall surface drains,  n      and width restoration at km 21.5, (b) Marsyangdhi-Pokhara (44
Ian) - overlay and minor widening to 5.5. m in full or part, (c) Butwal-Tansen (37 kan) - overlay and
slope stabilization works (latter to be Ihnited to containm, repair and erosion control methods rather
than full miigation of slope hazards), (d) Mugling-Namyanghat (36 km) - overlay which should be
retained for last slice of the proam, (e) Tansen-Syangja (84 kn) - surface dressing to ensure better
performance, and (e) Naubise-Hetauda (107 km) - coimnment of landslides, improvement of cross and
side drainage and river trainig and protection works, base course repairs and surface dressing (to address
the July 1993 floods). This component also includes rebabihtation of 130 km of sategic feeder roads
including resaling of Birguij-Kallya, regravelling of Tansen-Ridi-Tanigas, and Nepalgumj-Bagauda,
sbjoect to detailed fasibility studies and environmet sm   accordn  to the SEA Guidelihes
(preliminary feasibility prepred during Project preparation indicates that low-cost rehabilitation could
be justfied if the existng carriage widh is mained, improvements in side and cross-drainage are
mphasized and  onuon of bridges is undeaken only when stictdy necessary. The preparatory
work for the rhabilitaton   sategic higways has been reviewed with DOR and the selection of the
above mentioned (optimal) tratents has been agreed between IDA and DOR. The final costs were
prepared based on the final eineering design and were confirmed during negotiations.
The rehabilitation component will be implenented in two phases. Pbase 1 includes: (a) 92 km of
asphalt overlay and rehabilitation on 3 strategic highways (i.e., Thankot-Naubise (12 kn), Marsyangdhi-
Pokhara (44 km), and Butwal-Tansen (37 hIn)), (b) 107 kn of emergency rehabilitation of the Naubise-
Hetauda road, and (c) 11 kn of base course and surface dressing of the Chaudar-Gaddachauki road
(which for practical purposes is incuded in the periodic mantenance cost tables as part of the Atada-
Gaddachauki road). Phasc 2 includes: (a) two sections of strategic highways (i.e., Mugling-Narayanghat
(36 km) - asphalt overlay (to be retamined for the last year), and Tansen-Syanaja (84 kn) - a periodic
maintenance surface drssing to ensure better performance); and (b) three strategic feeder roads, subject
to results of envi       screening and final feasibility analysis to be completed during Project
implementation, including: (i) Bigunj-Kalaiya (15 kn) - surface dressing and reconstuction of a timber
bridge, (ii) Ridi-Tamgas (58 kmn) - regravelling, and (iii) Nepalgunj-Bagauda (50 kn) regraling and
bridge constuction. The implementation of phase 1 has sarted with advanced procement actions
expected to include conact award before May 1994, and works to be completed before June 1996. The
implementaion of phase 2 wors will start in June 1995 and is expected to be completed by June 1997.

Status of Prenaration
Feasibility reports were prepared by N.D. Lea Associates for the phase 1 works. During a review
of the report at appraisal IDA confirmed that it addressed comments made on a previous version during
pre-appraisal. The analysis presented in the report follows a generally sound techno-economic
methodology utilizing the HDM-l model, calibrated to Nepalese conditions. The application is based
on mostly original survey data, but also utilizes previous studies to the extent possible, with judicious
modifications where appropriate (for example, in calibrating estimates of vehicle operating costs (VOC)).
The evaluations are being improved with additional technical assessment of viable options on each site
(further assessment of structural design estimates, single vs. double surface treatment, shape correction
needs, etc.), which are to be incorporated in the final phase of the services. As a result, the
recommendations of treatments are basically sound, and were reviewed durig the appraisal mission,
resulting in an upward revision of estimated costs.  During Project preparation site specific
recommendations were incorporated in the bidding documents by the consultants.
The consultants have completed the final engineering design and bidding documents based on
IDA's Sample Bidding Documents. The model SBDs and the list of changes to the SBDs for the phase
I works have been cleared by IDA before negotiations (i.e., with the exception of the emergency works
for the Naubise-Hetauda emergency works which have been cleared following negotiations, and the design
for slope stabilization in the Butwal-Tansen road which would be prepared during Project
inplementation). Given the nature of the slope stabilization recommended for the Butwal-Tansen and
Mugling-Narayanghat roads, it was agreed that engineering design of this sub-conponent would be part
of the construction supervision services and the Terms of Reference were agreed to during negotations.
The additional engineering design for the phase 2 works would be undertaken as part of the supervision
contract as envisioned in the LOI to the consultants selected for phase 1, which includes assistance with
bid evaluation for the phase 1 contacts.
In order to initiate the rehabilitation and overlays during the FY94 dry season, prequalification of
contractors (for the phase 1 works) has been carried out. Tenders are expected to be invited by Februarv
15. 1993, and contcts awarded by May 31. 1994 (after credit effectiveness). This schedule allows only
3.5 months for tendering and bid evaluation.
The Supervision and Desin Technical Assistance as stated in the LOI would include a chief
resident engineer, specialist inputs from a surface dressing and asphalt specialist. In addition, as
discussed above, a geotechnical engineer (visiting specialist for 12 staff moths) would be required for on-
site design and supervision of slope stabilization works under this Project component. The present
consultant services contract would be modified to include assistance with bid evaluation sometime in
February 1994. DOR informed that the consultants have been requested to submit a proposal for
supervision services before credit effectveness, to be evaluated and a recommendation to award
forwarded to IDA before board presentation.
The procue     timetable for this Project co nt requires a series of carefillly planned actions
which are outlined in Amnex 10. In order to start the contracts under the first phase after credit
effectiveness and to at least have the contractors mobilize during before 10194 ('94-'95 dry season), the
following implementation time table would need to be followed:

05/01/94              Credit effectiveness
The above time table provides the main highlights to enable MOWT/DOR and the contractors to
finalize all financial and legal arangemens (advance payment for mobilization and bank guarantees,
import licenses, labor formalities, etc.) and mobilization of equipment with sufficient time to start field
work in October 1994 (dry season '94/'95).
During negotiations agreement was confirmed that rehabilitation works over US$ 1 million would
be procured under ICB. Contractors will be requested to bid for each single slice and to offer discounts
if awarded more than one slice. It is estimated that the phase 1 works could be completed in 2-3 dry
seasons, i.e. latest by 96/97.
The works to be packaged under LCB should encourage an active participation of national
contractors in the bidding. The success of the strategy will largely depend upon the success of the
Training Activities foreseen under the Project. In order to simplify the commercial sections of the tender
documents for the benefit of the national contractors, the Bidding Documents have been prepared
according to the Bank's SBD for "smaller contracts".

ROAD M-AINTNANCE AND RPHAlITATlON PO1ECT
IMPROVING RON  AMERRT
MfAINlANCE OTIONS IN THIE DIVX1ON
1.  Bdum
Routine, recrrent and periodic maintenance activities are in ent and, in combination,
represent a cost effective meas of retaiing the seiceability of a road and delaying the need for more
expensive rebabilitation measures.  Of these acti es, those comprising routine and recurrent
maitenance of the drainage and carriageway are a prereisite for an economic penodic maitenance
programme.
Routine and recrent maintenc activities should be carried out every year on each road link in
the network. The ann is to orgaise the work in a regular and sysematc manmer such that an adequate
standard of work is achieved and resources are used effectively. In this way a greaer length of road can
be maintained with the available funds.
The technical requiement of routinrecurrent maintenance are low, the problem is one of
management rather than of enginering. The key is to undertake relatively small amouns of work
routinely rather than large amounts at iequent ineals. To achieve this, the Divisional Engineer must
have detailed infonnation on the sections of road to be maintaind (the road inventory), the operating
conditons (affic, climate, constuction materi) and the history and present condition of the pavement.
Feedback on the perormnce levels and sufficiency of the various maitenance activities are also
essential.
The following components of Division leve operations will therefo  need to be addressed
concurently:
* management systems;
*  implementation methods;
* standards of workmansbip.
MAD     M Systems - a magement system for routne/recurnt maintenance activities is basically
any logical process involving work progra     and resomce schedulig. Various approaches are at
present being tried in Nepal on the Eastn Region Road Maitenance Project and the Lamosagu-Jiri
Road Manten  Project supported by ODA and SDC respectively. However, it is extremely difficult
to transfer externally developed project systems direcy into the DOR oganition. Further development
and adaton is usually needed wbich can only be deermid though testmg in the DOR working
enVironment.
hMAMNVAL9AMe os- there are several methods for imiplementing routinerecurrent ffmaintenance:



- 74 -
Page 6 of 8
* DOR direct labour organisadon;
* local contractor; and
* lengtman.
Among these methods, the DOR direct labour organisation and local contractor appear most suited for
Nepal. Trials are being carried out on the maintenance projects noted above but furnher testing will be
necessary under DOR working conditions. In using contractors for this work, suitable forms of contract
will have to be prepared and evaluated in conjunction with specified work standards and quality control
measures.
Standards of Worikmashl - present work standards will need to be assessed and where necessary,
improvemens inroduced through training and comple     changes in the working environment.
Pollowing a period of trial and evaluation, reo ned work practices will be incorporated into road
maintenance manuals for Nepal addressed particularly at Overseers and Assistant Fngineers in DOR.
2.       _bne   Usibennc DhSmm  SMDs)
The stategy for obtning improvements in routinel recurrent maitn     and the mangent of
emergency maintenance is to introduce, test, develop and consolidate new systems and procedures within
Stugthened Maintea  Divisions (SMDs). The SMDs represent a pilot operaion and will comprise
existing DOR Divisions under the control of the Divisional Engineer. Limited technical assistance and
basic infastructur support will be provided for the SMDs.
The approach will be to review present operations in these divisions and propose changes where
needed rather than attempt to introduce completely new systems. As noted, valuable experience can be
gained from the work already being undertaken by on-going donor funded maitenan  projects and close
liaison will be maitained with them. The information acqired should provide useful guidelines for the
SMDs and base data for comparison. In tum, the results of the SMD exercise will be fed back to the
projects.
The strategy is programmed to start with two Divisions in fiscal year 93194. If these are successful,
the exercise will be gsauy extended to cover the whole of the Strategic Network. It is envisaged that
there would be 3 more SMDs in operation during fisca year 94195, increasing at a rate of about 3 per
year onwards.  However, man        activities can only be effective on roads which are in a
maintable condition. The expansion of the SMDs is therefore closely linked with the rehabilitation
and resealing programmes of the World Bank Road Maitenance Project and other projects for
rehabilitation and new constuction on the Strategic Network.
The DOR has selected Chitwan, and Lalitpur as the initial SMDs. These Divisions are in Central
Region and therefore within reasonable distance of Katmandu to facilitate monitoring, they also
encompass maintainble roads in the Terai, mid-hills and urban environments.
3. &M&rt for the SMDs
It is intended that the work in tie SMDs will be carried out by the Divisional Engineer and his staff
under normal DOR operaing conditions. Support -;lI, however, be needed in the form of limited



- 75 -
Anun5
Page 7 of 8
technical assistance (expatriate and local consutant) and basic infastructue requirements. The latter will
comprise improvements to Division Office facilities, items of survey and testing cipment and transport
in order that the SMDs can function with reasonable efficiency.
If maintenance operations are to be carried out efficiently, wt only is an adequate level of funding
important but, equally, disbursement must be relatively free from constraints. At present, a combination
of weak institutional capabilities and procedural complexities hamper the timely release of funds. To
remedy this situation it is proposed to establish a self-sustaining (revolving) fund for road maintenance
within MOWTIDOR. The fimd will cover the costs of routine, recurrent, penodic and emergency
maitenance on the strategic network and will be financed by direct road user revenues (tolls) and a
proportion of indirect road user revenues from fuel taes. These revenues would be transferred to the
fimd directly at source and the level of the fimd would be a minimum compatible with supportg the trial
maitce operations in the SMDs.
4.               of «e SMDB
4.1 MM Start-Up
Work has already sted in FY 1993/94 wih the support of the MRCU in Chitwan and Lalitpur
Divisions as the initial SMDs with a view to commencing improved routine and recurent mainace
operations. This work comprises the use of a road inventory and pavement condition rating to prepare
a work schedule for the year and hence a needs related budget. The Divisions will be monitored against
their work schedles. Basic inftuctue support for these Divisions will be provided by the Swiss
Government. During negotiations the Government and SDC confirned that the Project Docwment is
under review and would be forwarded to IDA for review and comments. The supporting measures
comprise:
rTEM
(i) Office rehabilitaton and the provision of equipment and
finiture.
(ii)  Provision of transport and maece eupmen.
(iii)  Provision of small eipme  and tools.
This support will also include part-ime (approximately 50%) technical assistance inputs of an
SDC, and short-term inputs of local consultants supplied through the MRCU.
4.2 SMD ExtensIn
it is intended that the SMD concept will be etended to other Divisions under the RMRP as set-
out in section 2 with effect from fiscal year 94/95. In selecting the Divisions, particular attention will
be paid to ensure that as roads on the Strategic Network are brought into a mninnable condition,

Annex S
Page 8 of 8
according to the tables by political district (2-4 districts in one of DOR's Division) included in this annex,
an SMD is established to insdtute planned maintenance activities on these roads, The process will
continue until the whole of the Strategic Network is brought into a miainable state and is under the
control of an SMD.
External supporting measures for the expansion progranmne will be similar to those adopted for
the initial two SMDs. Limited technical assistance will be provided in the form of a single resident
expatriate supported by short-term inputs of local consultants supplied through the MRCU. The MRCU
will have a continuing policy development and co-ordinating role in the establishunen of the SMDs.
Capital inputs will be similar to those noted in section 4.1 and will be supplied under bi-lateral
aid with the exception of maintenance equipment and tools. These items will be procured by LA and
operated under the SED concept ie they will be suplied to the DOR Mechanical Division to be hired out
to the SMDs at commercial rates. The amual budget for the SMDs must make provision for these costs.
Based on the detailed preparations for the first two SMDs, the final budgets will be agreed upon
in the bilateral agreement.

ROQD MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
Pilot Labor Based District Road Rehabilitation Component
This project component would support a Pilot District Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance Fund
to provide technical and financial support to five (5) District Development Committees (DDCs) in
Western region in order to promote, or a pilot basis, low-cost, labor-based appropriate technology in road
rehabilitation. The districts selected for the pilot project, based on critena designed to make the new
labor-based program successful, include Nawalparasi, Rupandehi, Kapilbastu, Gulmi and Syangia.
The Government supports the devolution of responsibilities for the district and village road
networs to local organizations. However, while DOR plans to transfer the responsibility for local access
roads to the DDCs and VDCs, it is important to have a national focal point to help plan for rural roads,
to tackle common problems, to ensure national priorities and planning, and to deal with international
fimding agencies for rural road projects. For the pilot program, a District Road Services Development
Unit (I)RSDU) attached to the Secretary in the Miistry of Local Development will fill this vacuum.
Objectives
Tis project component will support low-cost, labor-based appropriate technology in road
rehabiliaion and maintenance by small contractors in four pilot districts in the Western region of Nepal
around Butwal. The project supports three main Government policies: (a) improvement of rural access
by rehabilitating and maiaining district level roads; (b) allevation of povert by the creation of gainful
employment; and, (c) decentralization by strengthening the District level local govetnment.
The pilot project's immediate objectives are to: (a) strengthen the capacity of the DDCs to: develop
planning capabilities, monitor procuement of civil works under contract, supervision with local
consultants, and to oversee a program of maintenance and financing of the district transport retwork; (b)
train small local contractors, DDC staff and DoR staff in the execution and supervision of the
rehabilitation and matenance of transport infiastucture using labor-based techniques (labor-based are
those techniques that use the  ptmm mix of labor and equipment in order to achieve the lowest cost);
(c) rehabilitate and maitain priority links of the District transport network using small local labor-based
contractors; (d) prepare a follow-p project that will replicate the approach in other districts and that will
apply labor-based methods in other fields of activity in the Districts.
The roads selected for the pilot project, based on consultation with DDCs, pre-screening based on
crteria of suitability for the program, and final feasibility analyses are the following: (a) Manigram-
Devdaha (7.8 kn), (b) Bbaiawa-Parasi (17.8 kn), (c) Kxishannagar-Chotagawanpur (19 km), (d)
Bardaghat-Pratpur (14.7 kn), (e) Maheshpur-Parasi (12.4 km), MRM (Gorusinghe)-Patharkot (11 kIn),
(f) Lumbini-Koi-Taulihawa (22 kn) (regravel followed immediately with base course and SBST as part
of the periodic mance progrm subject to final feasibility and environmental screening according
to the SEA Guidelines), (g) Babdurganj-Tahawa (9 km), and (h) Naudanda-Karkineta (6 kn). In
addition, the Galang-Chapakot road (Syangja District) has been proposed and would be considered for

possible inclusion under the project to complete 140 kilometers under the project, subject to final
fesibilitv and environmental screening accordinSg to the SEA Guidelines.
Status of PrEwaration
MULTI Disciplinary Consultants financed under UNDP/91/003 have prepared the Pilot Labor-
Based District Road Rehabilitation and Maintenance component. The final report was the basis for Project
preparation and was discussed in the field with the local leaders and DDCs, and incorporated in its fial
form comments from IDA, ELO, UNDP and the National Planning Commission on the draft final report.
Furtier preparatoqy work funded as a vanation order has been undertaken by the same consultants to
prepare the engineering design, bills of quantities and simplified bidding documents for the fist 40
kilometers of roads.
A Project Formulation Framework (PFF) was been submitted in April 1993 for UNDP's
consideration to finance the Technical Assistance and Training of this Project component. A Project
Apprais Comnuittee meeting convened in November 1993 and recommended the approval of the
proposed funding. During negotiaions, UNDP informed IDA and HMG that the National Planning
Commission and the Ministy of Local Development have cleared the Project Document subject to minor
adjusutents. The key technical assistance is expected to be appointed by May 31, 1994.
At the central level the project will be under the responsibility of a District Road Services Steerng
Done~ made up of representatives of the National Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance,
the Ministry of Local Development, the Ministry of Works and Transport and the project representative.
The project will be executed by a District Road Services Development Unit (DRSDU), the location
of the DRSDU has been discussed with the Govermnent and it has been decided that the Ministry of
Local Development would be the appropriate Focal Point Institution.
Physically the DRSDU will be located in one of the selected districts Butwal where the training
school will also be based is recommended as a location for the DRSDU.
The technical assistance to the project (and to a similar project in the Eastern region funded by
DANIDA) will be funded by UNDP and executed by HMG/N. According to the rules for National
Exection the Government has proposed a NGO, Helvetas, as the inplementing agent. The ILO will be
involved in monitoring and backstopping.
The MOWT will designate a high level staff as the Co-ordinator between the project and the
MOWT. The Project Manager of the DRSDU would be an authorized signatary to the special account
of the Project in MOWT for items related to this Project component only. The Project Manager and the
Coordiator from MOWT will ensure timely disbursements of funds from the World Bank into the
project's revolving fund from which the works executed by the labor-based contractors will be financed.
While the technical assistance would be financed from UNDP through MLD, the civil works would
fimded from the Road Man_tnan  and Rehabilitation Project Special Account, and withdrawals would
only be made against conacts tendered and signed by the 4 DDCs, based on a certification by the
DRSDU.

In accordance with the Government's strategy of decentralization the main activity of the project
will be in the Districts. The DRSDU will assist and train the pilot DDCs staff, assist and supervise the
operation of the trining school, and provide co-ordination of donor support to the local services.
The DRSDU will also have the following personnel: (1) the Team Leader and a (2) Training
Adviser (both inerional experts provided by the implementing agent); (3 and 4) two Planning Advisers
(local consultants or National Vohnteers); (5) a Technical Advisor (a local consultant); and (6)
administrative staff
Local contractors will be selected based upon objective criteria ensuring that equal opportunmity is
guaanteed to all interested contractors. Twelve contractors will be selected and trained out of which
eight will get a trial contrc. The training of selected contcors in labor based rehabilitation, upgrading
and maitenance will Wei place in a training school located in the DoR compound in Butwal where
existig facilities are ava&iable. Its cental location in the country has been in favor of the selection of
Butwal. Cassroom trainng will take place in road construction techniques but also in management.
Further taining will take place on a 10 kilometers demonstration road near Butwal and then on trial
contracts of three to four kdlometers per conractor.
Ths school will also train techical staff from the DDCs and from DoR and representatives of user
committees, in the supervision of the works. The principal of the school will be seconded from DoR and
two trainers and adminiaive staff will be locally recruited. The school will be assisted by the
inernational taining advisor located at the DRSDU.
The project will provide this trainig free of cost but the Contractors will have to pay the salaries
of their technicians being trained as well as their per diems and travelling expenses. In a follow-up phase
to the pilot project, the cost of the tainng will also be charged to the contractors. Also in this follow-up
phase it should be explored if the school can be privatized, for example by turning over the operation of
the school to the Cotaor's Association of Nepal.
Four pilot district have been selected in the Western region around Butwal: Nawalparasi,
Rupandehi, KapUbastu, and Syanga. In these pilot districts about 140 km of district roads will be
rebabilitated and upgraded by local conractors, the works contract would be fuided by IDA.
It is expected that the prepration of the tran  and procurement of the equipment will take place
in the first half of 1994. Trining of the conactors will start in the middle of 1994, and the actual works
will be executed in 1995 and 1996.
All civl wo and enent would be financed under the Project component, through IDA funds
covering about 100%. The equipnt sets (i.e., each consisting of two tractors, four trailers, one
pedestrian vibraory roller, one smooth wheel 8-10 ton roller, one water bowser, one water pump and
one drag attchm) would be made available to the conractors on a hire basis from the equipment
division in Butwal with a purcbase option (initially the property of the equipment rests in DOR). After
34 years of use, the equipment will be sold to the contractors who used them the longest period, at the
estimated depreciated price, faiing which they will be auctioned off. It is expected that the equipment
ses and the new technlogy wil be absorbed by the market for continued use. Durin negotiations it
was agecd that DOR's Heav Equimt Division will own the equipment. After the training neriod.
Ste MOP suMO ored the 2r i Of el    by auction the auM       to the contractors. The lease rates
reflecting full cost recovery should be worled out before the tral period starts.

Annex 6
Page 4 of 6
Ttee-planting alongside the project roads will be a special design feature, and this work will be
undertaken with community involvement. This is proposed to be given on contract to community groups
nominated by each village council along the project road; it will be supervised by an NGO, such as the
Junior Chamber (JCEES) International Chapters in Bhairawa and Butwal who have indicated tfieir interest
in doing this. The project will fund necessary supervision costs on a non-profit basis.
The promotionof aUpropriate transport vehicles (particularly bicycle-trailers and other adaptations)
will also be done through NGOs such as JCEES. Designs and models of these vehicle types will be
brought from other countries where this has proved successful, and the NGOs will arrange local
manufacure and distribution to women's groups and other user groups in the pilot Districts. It is
proposed to distribute about 800 units (700 trailers for goods and 100 trailers designed as rural ambulance
to carry sick people to rural health clinics); feed-back from users will be used to redesign the vehicles
as needed. As this is a promotional effort, only about 25% of the cost price of the units will be
recovered from users who choose to keep the units beyond the trial period (the cost pnce may be about
US$ 100 equivalent). The production, distribution and monitoring work will be given on contract to an
NGO; a rural transport engineer (UN Volunteer) wiU assist in overaU supervision of this component.
MonitorinulEvaluation
It is important to design a Monitoring/Evaluation system to assess the program and its socio-
economic impact. The design and subsequent follow-up of the monitoring system can preferably be done
by the local consultants who did initial economic and other studies for preparing this component, as this
wfill help in contimity and better undersadg of the socio-economic data.
mra on the environment
Most of Nepal is located in the mountain chains of the Himalayas, these relatively young mountain
chains are very vulnerable to weathering, and erosion and landslides are present everywhere. The erosion
threatens irrigation schemes and roads. Road construction disturbs the precarious equilibrium of the
mounin slopes and erosion control is therefore an absolute necessity. The measures required for erosion
control are very labor intensive: tree planting, gabions, dry stone walls, small drainage structures in
masonry, etc. Labor-based construction methods are therefore well suited for road construction in the
hill districts of Nepal. Some projects have already tested environment-friendly construction techniques
like bio-engneeing on the Palpa project (funded by Helvetas) and green roads (GTZ). The project should
elaborate on these techniques and further the generalization of the use of these techniques. This will have
an exemplary effect and thereby may positively influence other projects in Nepal
pr         arem
The DRSDU will select the contractors for training from the Pilot Districts, based on advertisement
and objective screening criteria which will emphasize good performance in previous contracts. The Pilot
Project would aim at training Class B, C and D contractors in labor-based appropriate technologies
sulemented with small equipment. Since many 'B' class contractors own heavy equipment, not more
than 1/3 of the selected conractors will be from B" category, to avoid conflict of interest with the new
technology.



- 81 -
Annex 6
Page 5 of 6
The training of contractors will be on 2 main topics: (1) management training, and (2) supervision
trawng. The instruction period would be about 2 - 3 monfts per topic. A total of 12 contractors will
be trained, of which 8 will get a trial contract. The courses will be practical and comprise a 10 kan
model road training section to be followed by trial contracts on a 24 kn section. The courses will be
residential.
The successful graduates from the training courses will be invited to participate to bid for the
balance of the rehabilitation program, which will be split into 8 slices. All successful contractors
graduated are automatically pre-qualified.
Tender docments for 40 km have been prepared according to IDA's Sample Bidding Documents
for "smaller contracts", adapted for LCB. To ensure pilot program success the contract will be based
on methods specification, and competition will be among the successfil trained contractors (10-12 bidding
for 8 jobs, as limited by the available eight equipment sets). Agreements were reached during
negotiations on the special rocurement proceures for this component which will involve:
(a)  award of trial contracts without bidding to the contractor trainees based on estiated unit
costs, during the tria phase of training;
(b) mixing of B,C,D contractors without following the prescribed financial thresholds (14Rs 10
million, NRs 3 million, NRs 1 million); and
(c) after the trial period and for the rest of the pilot project works, competition will be limited
to the trained contaors and the use of method specifications. Govenment should also
consider (i) increasing the above thresholds which wert fixed 12 years ago, by at least
doubling them for all contract categories; (ii) creating a special category of contractors (say
E category) who are trained as labor-based contractors under this or equivalent program,
so that some fiuure contracts can be awarded by DDCs open only to this category; this is
not critical,but can help spread and sustain the' new technology more effectively.
It is expected that the training program will commence in 1994 and the acual field work in '95 -
'96 dry season, and the entire program be completed in 1998.
IDA's inputs will be provided through the Project. The Project Manager of the DRSDU would
be an authorized signatary to the Special Account for the RMRP (for this conmonent only) ensuring that
funds would be available promptly for payment to the contractors which is of capital importance for the
success of the project. The operation of the Special Account would follow IDA's Guidelines on
disburements. Payments to the contactors will be done monthly by the DRSDU from the revolving
fund, based upon works executed and approved by the supervising consultants.
I deent auditing of the revolving fund by the Auditor General will be required amnually.
The equimt sets would be procured giving consideration to standardization which could give
preference to equipment which can be manined locally and spare parts are readily available.
DANIDA is consideting financing a simlwar progrm in the Eastern region around Biratnagar, they
will use a similar approach funding the works of about 100 kilometers of road rehabilitation and funding



- 82 -
Annmex 6
Page 6 of 6
the purchase of five equipment sets. Coordination would be required as the procurement of similar
equipmt would facilitate traing.
It is expected that at the end of the project the districts will be able to mnage their transport
infrastructure. They will have leamed to use local consultants and small labor-based contractors. The
local consultants and small labor-based coators will have been trained by the project to operate as
small businesses applying labor-based techniques. The small contractors will have been able to acquire
the small equipment they need. Based on the experience in other countries, the unit costs of the works
under this method will be less than under the capital-intensive method. The small labor-based contractors
will thus be able to compete with equipment-based contractors and win contracts in a competitive market
after the project period.
Follow-Up
In a follow-up phase the project will replicate the approach in other districts and will apply labor-
based techniques in other fields of application. Funding for the follow-up study are provided under the
Credit.

ROAD MAINTENANCE AND REHABILITATION PROJECT
PORITY INVESTMENT PLAN (ROAD MASTER PLAN)
FOR THE STRATEGIC ROAD NETWORK AND RURAL TRANSPORT
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR CONSULTING SERVICES
I. OBECTIES
1.   The main objectives of the consulting services are:
(a)  to define the basic grid on which the strategic road network and the rural sport network
should develop, their integration, and the optimal phasing of investments and maintenance
over a 10-year period, taking into account environmental, social and economical
considerations;
(b) to determnme the optimal balance between investments and maintenance;
(c)  to determine the optimal balance among:
(i) constuction of new roads of the strategic road network (national highways and
feeder roads and brdges);
(ii) improvement, rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing strategic road network;
(iii) development of the rural transport network (district roads, trails and suspension
bridges); and
(iv) improvement, rehabilitation and maintenance of the existing rural transport network;
(d)  to determine an appropriate level of expenditures on investment and maintenance given local
resources and absorptive capacity constraints (financial, technical, and human resource
related) and the probable level of foreign assistance in the sub-sector in the next few years:
(e)  to assist in preparing a Priority Investment Plan and review process under the policy
objectives set by the Eighth Five Year Plan (EFYP) identifying potential programs and
projects for the stegpc network and the rural transport network for financing by the major
donors active in the sector; and
(f)  to provide appropriate training to NPC's Transport Unit and MOWTIDOR and other local
staff in the Ministry of Local Development (MLD) in modern road planming and analytical
techniques.

Annex 7
Page 2 of 8
II. SCOPE OF WORK
2.   The Consultants shall carry out all engineering and economic stud."s, including topographical
surveys and pavement strength tests, needed to attain the objectives stated above. The analyses would
have two major components: (a) strategic road network, and (b) rural transport network. Regarding the
strategic road network, sectoral investments on development and upgrading wIll be conducted and overall
maintenance strategies would be developed based on the World Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance
Model (HDM  l) which has been recently calibrated for Nepal's conditions developing the regions in a
balanced manner. Regarding the rural transport network, an integrated rural transport strategy would be
developed for development and maintenance of district and rural roads, trails and suspension bridges and
appropriate means of transport, based on the final reports of the District Network Analysis. Following
is a more detailed description of the main tasks to be undertaken by the Consultants:
Review of Technical Studies and Detailed Work Progam
3. The Consultants wiDl review all relevant studies carried out in the subsector in the past and extract
any information that may be used by the present study. Based on this information and their initial
findings, the consultants will update and revise the original work plan submitted with their proposal and
provide a detailed schedule of work including the timing of key events and present it as part of the
Incedtion Report.
Traffic Forecasts and Network Analvsis
4.   Traffic Sudies.   Regarding the strategic road network, the Consultants will review the existing
affic data collected and analyzed by MRCU, N.D. Lea International (for the Road Maintenance Project)
and other consulants, prepare and carry out a program of additional data collection, and assess present
road traffic demand. The program will include, to the extent required, additional traffic surveys
(classified counts and axle load surveys) and origin/destinaton surveys for passenger and goods traffic.
Regarding the rural transport network, the Consultants will review the traffic data available, district road
network analysis, and ex-ante and ex-post feasibility studies of district and rural roads, trails and
suspension bridges to assess parameters of integrated rural transport demand.
5. Traffic Forecasts. The Consultants will prepare traffic volume and mix forecasts for highways
and feeder roads. The choice of appropriate foreating approach will be preceded and determined by
an assessment and analysis of: (i) overall economic development prospects and the resulting total transport
demand, (ii) the likely future modal distnrbution of traffic between strategic roads, rural transport network
and other modes of tranWort, and (iii) the demand to be met by the strategic road network and the rural
tLanwsport network in Nepal. Different scenanos could be developed and evaluated as appropriate.
6. Wherever predominantly stable growth conditions and only gradual changes in socio-economic
conditions are expected to prevail, the Consultants will extrapolate from past trends, making adjustments
that may be necessary to account for changes that are likely to modify these trends. Where major and
rapid changes in socio-economic conditions are expected, the consultants will prepare traffic forecasts in
three stages: (i) estimation of volume and location of future tourism, agricultural, industrial and mining
input and consumption, including imports and exports; analogous estimates of population and personal
income growth and of the inwcome elasticity of demand for transport will be necessary; (ii) translation of
population ad outpuconsumption forecasts into traffic - both by volume and by origin and destination



- 85 -
Annex 7
Page 3 of 8
and; (iii) distribution of traffic to the various transport modes, taking into account both perceived and
total distribution costs and any major planned transport projects (such as the tunnel between Kathmandu
and Hetauda, and the Banepa-Sindhuli road). The resulting road transport growth rates will be applied
to the base year traffic estimates to produce road traffic forecasts for the strategic road network and
parameters to estimate demand for the rural transport network.
7.   The Consultants should consider the almost uni-modal set-up of Nepal's transport system. Use of
a traffic assignment and forecasting model shall be supported by the rationale for the Consultant's choice
and present it as part of their proposal.
8.   On the basis of the traffic forecasts and taking into account the limited existing network, the
consultants will assess whether the segments additional to the existing grid of roads (including upgrading
of existing roads) are necessary to meet future traffic demand and sustainable taking into account
environmental considerations. Regarding the strategic road network, the Consultnts would prepare a
simple model to forecast traffic based on the above analyses. Regarding the rural transport network, the
Consultants should develop through a consultative process with District Development Committees and
local organizations (e.g., users groups) a revised assessment of demand for rural transport at the district
level based on the District Road network Analysis. The demand for roads would be, e.g., a function of
productive potential, social service delivery needs, accessibility, aggregate transport cost functions and
resource mobilization capacities (local and central level).
Technical Data Collection
9.   Strategic Network. The consultants will review and update the following techical data in the
format reqred by the HDM-M model.
(a)   Vehicle Opaing Costs. The Consultants will review and update the calibrated VOC
model prepared for the Road Mainance Project.
(b)  Construction and Mantenance Costs. The consultants will review and update estimates of
unit costs for construction and maintenance works to be used in the modelling phase (HDM
and transport model), based on existing studies (e.g., Sharma and Shrestha (1992)) and data
from a sample of upgrading and construction works carried out in the recen past. Costs
should be considered both in financial as well as economic terms.
(c)   Road    . The consultant will review the reference system developed by MRCU. The
data for paved roads is described in Appendix 1. Road data for unpaved roads will be
limited to roughness, CBR of the naural subgrade, thickness and characteristics of the
pavement materials, road geometry and the carriageway and formation widths. It will be
collected on sample basis for typical sections and estimated elsewhere. The samling rate
will depend on the economic importance of the roads considered.
(d) Bridges. The consultants wil update the inventory of bridges done by MRCU. The
imventory will include a summauy description and classification into major types and
conditions of all bridges and ferries on the strategic road network, and suspension bridges
under MOWTADOR and MLD. A review of unit maienan  costs for bridges will also
be included.



- 86 -
Annex 7
Page 4 of 8
10. Rural Transvort Network. The consultants will review and update the following technical data:
(a)   Construction and Maintenance Costs.  The Consultants will review existing data in
construction, upgrading and maintaining district and rural roads, trails and suspension
bridges, taking into account risk engineering factors .
(b)  District Roads and Rural Roads. The technical data would be limited to simple condition
data for gravel roads (as described in Appendix 1), and reviewing the data and network
modelling of the District Road Network Analysis.
(c)   Trails and Suspion Bridges. The consultants will review the existing data from the
various trails and suspension bridges programs.
it. Air Transport Network. The consultants will review and update the basic data of air transport
network in order to esfimate basic unit costs to comnpare with other modes of transport affecting rural
accessibility.
Road Inventory and Database
12.  While the consultants will produce the road data described above primarily for the network
modelling, the format in which this information will be gathered and presented will be developed jointly
with the NPC and MOWT/DOR to develop a review process, preferably on a desktop computer. As part
of this effort, the consultants will review inventory procedures fromn DORJMRCU.
Analysis and Evaluation
13.  Strategic Road Network. The analysis would consist of a prioritization of constuction, upgrading
and maintenan   investments based on the network modelling, ranked according to economic criteria and
considering most liKely sectoral budget ceiling limitations.
14.  For analysis of the mintenance options of the existing roads of the strategic road network, the
consultants will group the referenced roads into categories or groups of homogenous sections with similar
characteritcs such as traffic range, pavement type and condition (roughness level), structural strength,
and so on. Sections requiring special attention should be analyzed separately. For all groups of road
sections defined above, the consultants will define the investments and the corresponding maintenance
needs that will be technically justified to match the capacity of the segment to future road transport
demand. The consultants will use HDM-i to compare the options and select the economically optimal
strategy for the full network. The options to be considered shall include construction of new road
sections and realigrnents; widening of existing pavements reconstmuction on existing alignments to
improved road standards (upgrading); provision of full strength pavement overlays (including widening
and levelling course where needed); periodic maintenane operations such as thin premLx overlays, single
or double surface levelling courses; improvement of subgrade stngth through better compaction methods
and/or stabilization; improvement of embankments and addition of drainage strcures to prevent damage
from flooding; and so on.
15.  RuraM Transport Netwok. The main objective would be to develop an Intgrted Rural Transport
Strategy (IRTPS) to develop paramets and criteria to prioritize rural transport investments in each



- 87 -
Annex 7
Page 5 of 8
distnct. The IRTPS would be a framework to assist local organiations in the planning of construction,
upgrading and mintnce of district and mral roads, trails and suspension bndges. Based on the global
demand assessments, the Consultants would assess the main human, financial and institutional resource
requirements to implement the strategy, and rather than identifying specific invetmens, it would
pnioritize in general terms the proposed investments of the District Road Network Analysis considering
to minimize total rural transport costs. The IRTPS could build upon the GIS application already
developed by NPC.
Priority Investment Plan
16. On the basis of the above data and analyses, the consultants will define the basic grid on which
the strategic road network should develop, an integated rural transport strateg (IRTPS), and the optimal
phasing of investments and maintenance over a 10-year period, indicatig the optil balance among:
i) consuction and upgrading of the strategic road network; (ii) rehabilitation and maintnance of existing
roads and bridges of the strategic network; (iii) constuction and upgrading of the rural transport network;
and (iv) rehabilitation and _mtenance of the exiting mral anspo network (includig suspension
bridges under MLD and MOWT). It is expected that the consutans duing the courwse of their work will
compare several strategies for the development of the strategic and rural transport networks, their
ntgration, and several manena    strategies, which take into account the specific physical and
economic conditions, likely enviro_nentl impacts and necessary mtgion measures and natural
constraints of Nepal relevant for road development such as, inter alia, the coutry's difficult topography,
limited absorptive capacity, scarcity of humn resources in the road sector, land use predomialy for
agriculture, ecologically/environmentally sensitive areas, and relatively uneven distbution of populaion
centers. The consutants will review the availability of local and foreign financing for the road subsector
in Nepal, make reasonable assumptions of fuure levels consistent with the lending programs of the major
donors in the subsector (ADB, IDA, Japan, SDC, UK ODA, etc.) and match these against the opdmized
programs in the 10-year Plan to be reviewed periodically.
17. On the basis of the PIP, the consultants will review detailed budgets for the remaining years of the
EPYP period (1992-1997).
M. TRAINW
18.  The consultants will conduct onthe-job training of staff of NPC and MOWTIDOR in data
coluection, network modelling and review of the PIP, and as necessary for MLD staff in dirict road
network prioritization.
19.  The consultants will assist the NPC and MOWT/DOR to identify,traning needs for HMG staff in
modern road planning and analytical techniques including GIS.  I
20. With a view to further developing the GIS capabilities at NPC, NPC and DOR will have complete

IV. EQUIPMENT
18.  For carrying out the Technical Assistance, the consultans will procure vehicles and equipment
following the Bank's Guidelines on Procurement. On completion of their services, vehicles and
equipment will be handed over to the DOR.
V. STAEIN_q
19.  The consultants are expected to seek association with local consulting firms to provide the services
required. It is envisaged that a suitable mix of internationally and locally recruited professionals and
support staff will be needed in the fields of highway engineering, transport and agricultural economics
and planning, rural appraisal, pavement and materials engineering, bridge engineering, hydrology,
systems analysis and modelling, and other related fields.
VI. TIME SCHEDULE AND REPORTING REOUIREMENTS
20.  The consultants shall mobilize theirteam in Kathmandu withintwo weeks of the date of the signing

findings on the strategic network and the rual transport network, mobilization of staff, a first assessment
of available data and of site conditions, and a detailed revised work program and schedule of activities.
Progress Reports shall contain a brief summary of the work accomplished in the preceding two months,
an outline of work expected to be completed during the next progress reporting period, and the
consultants' comments or    o   ns on any unforeseen conditions that may affect the progress or
quality of their work. The Inteim Rep shall contain a summary of the findings and recommendations
of the consultants on review of studies, calibration of network models, GIS application, network database,
traffic studies and forecasts, capacity of existing strategic network and proposed Integrated Rural
Transport Strategy Framework for evaluation. The Draft Final Report shall include the result of analyses
of the scope of works outlined above including a PIP and review process. The Final RWprt shall reflect

APPENDIX 1
Data to be collected for strategic road network from MRCU and field surveys:
(i)    Pavement
a.   Width. The consultants will measure pavement and shoulder widths as needed
but at least once in every kilometer.
b.   Curvature and Gradient. Using a hand held conmpass with a clinometer, or
other suitable instruments, the consultants will determine the average curvature
n degrees per km and the average gradient in mlan for each road section
referenced in the network.
C.   Structures and CBRs. The consultants will open test pits in the existing
pavements and shoulders every 25 km or less, if required, in order to
determine the existing pavement structure, measure thicknesses of each
individual layer, determine bearing capacity and neasure CBR and moisture
content of the natural subgrades and shoulders. Between two test pits, the
dynamic Cone Penetrometer (DCP) will be used on the shoulders to assess the
variability of CBRs of the subgrades and on the pavement layers (if driving
the DCP through the macadam layers is not found possible, then the
consultants will bore a pre-hole through it) to assess the pavement thickness
and bearing capacity profile and to determine the structural strength of the
pavements. DCP on pavements should be at 2 km intervals for national paved
highways and roads with more than 500 vpd and at 5 km intervals on other
paved roads. The consultant will ensure that deflection data (section (iii)
below) is available for some of the sites selected for the DCP.
(ii)    Rouighne. The consultants will review the roughness data from MRCU and if
required use a vehicle mounted response-type road roughness measunng system to
coUect additional data on existing roughness on each of the referenced road sections.
The system will be calibrated and periodically checked in accordance with the
Intnational Roughness Index (RI) standard. Consultants may limit the number of
runs per section to one in each direction unless the existng conditions warrant
oterwise.
(iii)    ltegtjon. The consultants will review the data collected by N.D. Lea International
and Roughton and Partners, and if required, measure additional existing pavement
deflections under a standard 8 T axle. All measurements will be carried out when
the pavements are soaked, preferably about the end of the monsoon, or else the
measures values should be adjusted suitably to represent soaked conditions. The
deflecion values will be correlated to the structural numbers determined from the
Dynamic Cone Penometr (DCP) measrements made under section (i) c above.

(iv)    Pavement Condition. The Consultants will review the Pavement Condition survey
for 1,000 kn carried out by MRCU, and if required, carry out additional surveys
using the same methodology, at a sampling rate of 5 per cent (50 meters in every one
kilometer), to detennine the surface distress (measured by dhe Surface Distress Index)
and the dominant mode(s) of distress (e.g., cracking, potholing, ravelling and rutting)
in each of the referenced road section.

ROAD MAINTENAN-CE AND REMABILITAURAN PROJECT
Economlic Evaluation
A.    IokWuctlon
1.           The civil works of the Project include:
1)    rehabiiion of strategic highways;
2)    rehailitation of strategic feeder roads;
3)    periodic maienance, including resealing and regrarveling of the strategic
network; and
4)    pilot labor-based distrct road mainte e.
2.           The economic analysis of the proposed project focusses on the civil work components.
The economic analyses are based on 1993 fincial costs, modified by appropriate conversion fcts to
represe  the economic costs. The rehabiLtation of strategic highways and feeder roads, as well as the
periodic mainte      of the strategic network are evaluated with the World Bank's Highway Design and
Maintenance Model (HDM M). In the case of the pilot labor-based maince projects, the World
Bank approved producer's surplus approach was used for the analysis.
3.           The cost of the civil works of the four compone   (including 10 percent physical
contingency and 8 pcent constution supervision) are estimated to be NRs 1,457 million. The economic
evaluation results indicate that the project will yield a high economic rate of return. The Economic Rate
of Retun (EIRR) vary from 11 to 36 percent. The economic cost the civil works is estimated to be NRs
1,311 million. The project will yield a Net Present Value (NPV) of NRs 1,414 million at 10 percent
social discount rate. The overall EIRR of the project is estimated to be 21.4 percent. The economic
indicators for various components and cash flows are listed in the following two tables:

4.           It should be highlighted here that the economic evaluation of the strategic feeder road
component was based on limited information. During negotiations, agreement was reached on the need
for a detailed feasibility study to be reviewed by IDA before undertaking these road works during Project
implementation. The feasibility studies will also include an environmental screening according to the
SEA. Only those projects meeting the following criteria would be financed under the Project:
1)    further economic feasibility studies demonstrate the project will yield an
economic rate of return equal to or higher than opportunity cost of capital in
Nepal, which is 10 percent;
2)    sound technical design are prepared; and
3)    an enviromnental screening show that the project will have no adverse impact on
the environment.
B.    Mai Benefits and Beneficiaries
5.           The major quantifiable benefits of the project include: (a) decrease in vehicle operating
cost through provision of better road surface condition; (b) decrease future major pavement rehabilitation
cost through provision of new surface layers to prevent further surface deterioration; (c) decrease in road
emergency maiWntenance costs due to the improvement in drainage and slope stabilization; and (d) decrease
in road user cost due to reduction in road closure when better drainage and slope stability are provided
by the program.
6.           Benefits from the project would accrue to road users in the form of transport cost and
time savings, and to the DOR in the form of reduced maintenance costs. The project will improve the
accessibility of the roads during the monsoon season improving the accessibility along the main roads.
The decrease in vehicle operation costs will reduce total freight transport costs and improve the overall
productivity of the regions.
C.    E-conomic Analysis with HDM Model
7.           Methodology. The evaluations of the proposed rehabilitation of strategic highways and
feeder roads, resealing and regravelling of strategic roads periodic maintenance) were prepared based
on the Bank's Highway Design and Maintnance Model (HDM m). The HDM-M is designed to estimate
total life-cycle costs - construction, maintenance and road user costs - as a function of road design,
maintenance standards, and other policy options. The model enables decision makers to compare costs
and benefits associated with different maintenance strategies.
8.           For any road, given the existing conditions of that road, the traffic characteristics, and
the mantenance policies, the HDM model can simulate the road surface conditions and vehicle operating
costs as they are affected by the level of maintenance. For each year of analysis, the road surface
conditions (roughness, rutting, cracking, etc.) are computed as a function of the pavement conditions at
the end of the previous year, pavement characteristics, climate, intensity of road maintenance, and both
traffic volume and composition. Vehicle operating costs on that surface are then computed as a function
of road surface conditions and vehicle characteristics. This simulation, repeated for each year of the
analysis period, produces the annual costs of road maitenance and vehicle operations for each

maintenance policy, from which economic comparison can be made.
9.           Different vehicle operating cost functions can be adopted in HDM-IIl. Since most of the
country's vehicle fleet consists of Indian-made vehicles, the India vehicle operating cost functions were
adopted with some modifications to overcome problems with their predictions or to allow them to be
extrapolated to high levels of roughness. Four representative vehicles were selected including: (a)
passenger car (i.e., four cylinder engine, e.g., Toyota Corolla), (b) utility vehicle (i.e., four wheel drive
and pickup truck), (c) medium truck (i.e., 7-15 ton capacity, e.g., Tata SE 1210 with a high sided body),
and (d) buses (e.g., Tata LP/52). The summary of HDM-i input data is in the table below:

10.          Preparation of Basic Inut Data. The basic input data required for the HDM model
consisted of:
(a)   existing road characteristics;
(b)    vehicle characteristics and costs;
(c)   traffic volumes, compositions and growth characteristics; and
(d)    maintenance unit costs.
11.          Existing road conditions include data on climate, road geometry, the type and strength
of the pavement structure, and existing surface roughness. The detailed road condition data are obtained
through field surveys conducted by DOR and various consultants teams.
12.          Based on the four representative vehicles, five vehicle types were considered in the
analyses. These vehicle types are listed as follows:
a) car
b) utility
c) empty truck
d) loaded truck
e) bus
13.          Traffic data include traffic volume, vehicle composition and growth characteristics.
Although the traffic composition varies from one road to another road, for simplicity, a standard traffic
composition derived from traffic surveys is used for all the subprojects in the analysis. Road traffic was
projected using a growth factor common to all vehicle types. An annual growth rate of 6 percent are used
in the traffic projection. The percentages of each vehicle type in ADT are listed as follows:
Vehicle Type              Percentage
Car                        15.0
Utility                    18.0
Empty truck               22.5
Loaded truck               22.5
Bus                        22.0
14.          Calibraion of HDM-lU. The calibration of the model was performed to ensure that the
predictions of HDM-lu were relevant to Nepal vehicles and operating conditions.
15.          The VOC are predicted mostly using the India VOC model since, as stated above, most
of the heavy traffic in Nepal are Indian produced vehicles. Speeds are predicted using the Brazil speed
prediction model but using India parameter values.
16.          HDM-M was modified to consider crack progression as a fimetion of traffic. However,
it was found that the surface treatment predictions were unreasonable so it was necessary to revert to the
standard time based equations. The HDM-HI equation for predicting the effect of overlays on roughness
was replaced with one derived in Indonesia on similar pavements to thuse in Nepal. The rate of crack

Annex 
Page 6 of 13
progression after an overlay was increased as a fimcdon of the amount of wide cracking before the
overlay.
17.          The caliron focused on the effect of roughness on VOC and not on the absolute values
of the VOC predictions. However, in conparing the predictions of HDM-M Nepal to truck data
collected in a small survey it was found that there was good agreement between the predicted and
observed costs. Thus, HDM-l Nepal should be appropriate not only for maintenance studies but also
for plaming purposes.
18.          Main           Policies. A road maintea   policy defines two aspecs: (i) the types of
mntenance ativity underken, and (ii) the intervals at which the activity should be performed. Various
types of maintenance activities are considered in the modeing. These activities and their unit cost are
listed as follows:
Maint. Type               F. Cost       E. Cost             Unit
Gravel Roads
Crading                    2,459 2,213 NRs per kldometer
Spot regravelling            169          152        NRs per sq. meter
Gravel resurfcing            169          152        NRs per sq. meter
Roune                      19,000 17,100 NRs per kilometer
Paved Roads
Patching                    384           346        NRs per sq. meter
Single Surface Dressing      73           66         NRs per sq. meter
30 mm Hot Rolled Asphalt    214           193        NRs per sq. meter
50 mm Hot Rolled Asphalt    327           294        NRs per sq. meter
80 mm Bitumen Macadam       432           389        NRs per sq. meter
19.          It should be noted that the above unit mantenance costs are for those activities listed only.
The actual cost of iial tratm  of the projects in the proposed road maintenance program will be
highe bcaue ther are usually other works involved, such as drainage clearing, minor slope
stabilization, etc.
20.          The tming of mantenance activities can be specified to follow a fixed schedule (e.g.
every 30 days, or every 10,000 vehicle passes), or to be condition responsive (e.g. patch all cracks when
crakng coves 20 percent of the pavement surface). For each sub-project, both a with-project and a
without-project case were established for analysis and compro n by the HDM model. To avoid
distorton, adequate maintea    levels were assumed for both "with" and "without" cases.
21.          Since routine mainten  are not commonly practiced in Nepal, for all the projects in



- 136 -
Anx 11
Page 7 of 13
regravelling, no maintenance was selected while for paved road only patching the potholes are selected
for "without" cases.
22.          For rehabilitation or resealing projects, "with" cases adopt the following maintenance
policy:
(a)   resealing or overlay immediately;
(b)    patching 100 percent of pothole area and resealing every 7 years.
23.          For gravelling and sealing projects, the following maintenace policies was adopted for
"with" case in the model:
(a)   regravellirg and sealing with a surface dressing (SBST) immediately
(b)   resurfacing whenever the surface course is worn out to restore the thickness of
the surface course to the original thickness.
D.    Ma1i Anulvsl for Perodic M             Proar
24.          A large  mber of road sections were initially identified to be included in the periodic
reseang program. A field surv  to collect data on traffic, pavement surface distress and road roughness
for each road section was conducted by DOR. In order to prioritize those roads which are more likely
to yield high economic rates of retun, an initial screening of roads was conducted excluding those
projects which appeared to have low economic rates of returns.
25.          The projects' screening was carried out with an HDM matrix analysis in which roads
were classified according to their ADT, roughness (IRI) and surface distress index (SDI). An analysis
with HDM was carried out for the coreponding mntenace and representative ADT, lIR and SDI for
each group. A net present value matrix was built based on the results of the HDM analyses. The projects
in matrix cell with negative NPV would be classified as unfeasible and were therefore excluded from the
program The order of tratment priorities was also derived, and served as the basis to generate annual
pacages. The two tables below show the NPV (per kIn) and orders of treaunent priorities under different
road and traffic conditions derived from the matrx analysis.

26.          Results of Economic Evaluation of Reabitaina Stategc HihwM. There are six
projects included in the rehabfilaton of sategic highways component with a total distance of 320
kilometers. The major naitenance activities inchlde bituminous overlay, resealing, drainage and slope
stabilization. This cmont is esmated to cost NRs 651 million (in financial terms, NRs 586 million
in economic terms). The projects will yield overall NPV of NRs 553 million at 10 percent social discount
rate. EMRR's vary from 12 to 42 percent with an overall value of 19.4 percen. The detailed results are
presented in Table I(a pd). The overall cash flow for this cponentspresented in Table 2
(appendix).
27.          Rests of Econmic EvaluationOfRebiHtang Strag  Feeder Roads. Seven project
were originaUlly ideatified to be included in the program. Economic analysis indicates that four of them
would have low economic rates of retun. Therefore only three roads are included in this component,
namely Birgunj-Kalaiya, Tansen-Rid}-Thamgs and Nepalgunj-Bagoudar, with a total distance of 133 km.

The rehabilitation activities includes regravelling of gravel road, graveling an earth road, widening and
bridge repairing. The financial cost of this component is estimated to Nrs 210 million (Nrs 189 million
in economic terms). The EIRR's vary between 10 to 11 percent. The component will yield a NPV of Nrs
4.6 million at 10 percent social discount rate. The overall EIRR for the component is estimated to be
10.4 percent. The detailed results are presented in Table 3 (appendix). The economic cost-benefit cash
flow are presented in Table 4 (appendix). The evaluation of strategic feeder roads rehabilitation was
prepared on the basis of limited data. During negotiations it was agreed that a detailed feasibility study
be carried out for each of the projects in this component for review by IDA during the Project.
28.          Results of Economic Evaluation of Periodic Maintenance. Out of 2,000 kilometer of the
core strategic road network, about 40 road sections passed the initial screening. Further analysis revealed
that 8 road sections will yield an EIRR lower than 10%, the opportunity capital cost in Nepal. These
road sections were therefore excluded from the program. The remaining progran includes 32 road
sections with a total distance of 716 kilometers. Of these, about 650 kilometers were selected for the IDA
fnanced component of the RMRP, including 460 kilometers proposed for resealing of the existing paved
surfamce, and 150 kilometers for gravelling and sealing. The summary and the detailed list of the projects
included are presented in Tables 5, 6, and 7 (appendix).
29.          The financial costs of each road section were estimated based on the unit maintenance
rates. The basic unit rates were initially developed by the local consultants. They were estimated on a
per kilometer basis. These rates were then adjusted based on the road surface conditions. The basic unit
maintenance costs are listed as follows:
Unit Costs ('000 NRs/kn)

30.          The total cost of the component is estimated to be Nrs 571 million (financial cost, NRs
514 in economic terms). The EIRR's for this component fluctuate between 10 and over 50 percent. The
overall NPV of the component is estimated to be NRs 826 million. The EIRR is estimated to be 27.3
percent. The detailed cost and benefits of various road sections are presented in Table 6 (appendix). The
economic benefits and costs cash flow for the entire components are presented in Table 7 (appendix).

31.          Four projects are included in the first year of this conponent including:
1) Bardhagat-Praappur;
2) Manigram-Rohini River;
3) Bhairahawa-Baghela River; and
4) Bhagwanpur.
32.          The economic analysis of the pilot labor-based road maintenance components was
prepared by Multi Disciplinary Consultants Ltd.. During the preparation of the economic analysis, the
consultant conducted a socio-economic survey with interviews of a large number of households in the
zones of influence of the roads. Origin-Destination (OD) surveys were also carried out. The estimated
Annual Average Daily Traffic are as follows:

33.          Traffic growth rates used in the economic evaluations are projected in the following way.
For "without' project case, a uniform set of growth rates are used throughout the entire analyzed period.
For "with' cases, non agricultural traffic growth rates were estimated to be the same as the "without"
case, while 15, 10, 3, 1.5 percent, respectively, were used for all roads for the first four years. A growth
rate of 0.5% was used thereafter. These growth rates are illustrated in the following table:

34.           he economic benefits of the project are from savings in transport cost and likely increase
in farmer production and productivity due to better access to the market. It is estimated that the economic
cost of the civil components of the project would amount to Nrs 23 million (Nrs 27 million in financial
terms). The project will yield a NPV of NRs 30 million at 10 percent social discount rate. The economic
rates for each of the road sections inchlded in the project are all above 26 percent. The overall EIRR for
this components is esmaed to be 36 percent. The detailed costs and benefits for the projects are as
folows:

35.          Sensitivity analyses were carried out for road rehabilitation and periodic maintenance
components. The results indicate that the project will remain viable if the construction cost rose by 10
percent and benefits dropped by the same proportion, reducing the overall EIRR to 20 percent. It also
indicates that under this scenario, the EIRR of rehabilitating Strategic Feeder Roads drops to 9 percent.
Since the analysis for this components was based limited infonnation and only vehicle operating cost
saving was counted as benefit, the actual EIRR for this conponent will probably higher than the above
figure and likely to be above the acceptable level of 10%. The detailed results of sensitivity analysis are
presented in Tables 8 through 11 (appendix).

ROAD MAINTENA   AN) EHABITATION POJEC
Implemention of the Envomnt  As             ent
1.            This Annex is presented in two parts. The first part contains a compilation of suggestions made
by the Bank and the DOR for expansion and darificadon of the draft Sectoral Environmental Asesment of the
Road Maintenance and Redabilitation Project. Tle second section of the Annex addresses institutional srtening
measures that will need to be adopted if the DOR is to implement the SEA in an effective manner.
PART 1: Sectoal Environmental Aessment
hnpact Aswssment and Mamement
2.            The IDA environmental scening of this project places it in Category 'B'. This category suggests
that  'low-grade'  environmenal impacts may reut from project constuction and/or operaton.  Some
environmenal asesme, less than a conplete enviromental impact assessment, is required. During preparation
of the Project it was determined that a Sectral Enviro_nental Assessment (SEA) was a suitable response to the
minor environmeal problems that may or may not be present as a result of project implementadon. The SEA is
meant as a general guide to envimental as ment of sbprojects included under the IDA's proposed Road
Maintenance and Rehbilitation Project. It does not cover new road consution or peent a comprehensive
covrage of environmeta impact management of road constuction acdvides or operation, although it is anticipated
that it could be expanded in the future to include these other project types. The following sections reflect the
agreements reached during Project appraisal based on DOR's review and comments, and the recomnendations have
been taken into account durmg the prparon of the fin  SEA report.
Pres _inz and Impact A      _m M  u nt_ of the SA
3.            The SEA itsdf generaly provides a satisfactory methodology for handling environmental
management issues within the road mantenance and rehabilitationprogram of the IDA's proposed Road Maintenance
and Rehabilitation Project. I presents a simple screenig process for identifyng those subpojects that may require
special envi_rmenta review, and covers impact assessment and impact management of all other subprojects in an
activity by activity basis. However, it will eventually need s_tegthing if it is to be applied to major road capacity
expansion or new road projects, especialy those in the mountainu section of the country. While this was not
included in the consultant's terms of rehrence for ppration of the SEA, the SEA should contain a section on
Next Steps'. This section should outline the addito   work needed for preparation of more detailed guidelines
for environme  nal        of constuctin   and operation of road projects in Nepal (to serve as the basis of a
TOR for additional environmental wok in the fAure).
4.            The SEA methodology developed and used in other Asian countries also includes 'pre-screening'
criteria which should be used at the project identification and prioritizaton stage. These criteria are designed to
eliminme those subprojects from a credit AT TIE PROJECT IDENTIFICATION STAGE that would be likely to
be incompatible with IDA's envionmet Operationa Directivs or stated policy guidelines. For example, road
projects of any kind in national pars, World Heritage listed areas, water supply watersheds, or through habitats
coaining rare or endanged plants and wildlife would generaly not be eligible for IDA finance. Projects of this
nature should never reach the stage of being included in an SEA, as it is -ery unliky that the IDA or the Bank
would finance them. The SEA should be expanded to include a 're-screening* process to be implemented at the
project ideniicaion and prioritizadon stage of the project cycle.

Page 2 of 6
S.            The screening process included in the SEA divides subprojects in the Road Ma _eac and
Rehabilitation Project into those that require a project specific environmental assessment and those that can be
generally assessed under the impact assessment and impact managmt provisions included in the SEA. The SEA
exprssly excludes assessment of environmental impacts of the environment on the various subprojects. However,
the DOR has suggested that the screening process may be able to be modified to include IDENTIFICATION of
subprojects that would benefit from bioengineering to mimize probems related to slope stability. If this can be
done in a general way using slope, vegetation cover and land slip frequency on existing roads in the area, then it
is suggested that the screening process be so modified.
6.            The project specific environmental assessment proposed for subprojects with more significant and
likely impacts is an Initial Environmental Evaluation (LEE). The MEE is a recognized envirment assessment tool.
However, there is not a single, universally agreed upon, format for an lEE amongst workers in the envir
management field. indeed, there are many proposed formats. The IDA's Environmental Assessment Operational
Directive (OD 4.01) does not specifically mention or provide guidance for preparation or evaluation of an EE, nor
does it pesnt a list of project activities or project types that would require preaation of an IEE. In fact, the term
IE is note ven used in the Directive. It is therefore essentW that the SEA include a recommended foinat, or at
least r    eons for scope and content, of an IEE that would be suitable for project-specific en *viroent
assesmt of a road maintenance or road rehabilitation subproject under the Credit.
Environmental  naement Comonent of the SEA
7.            The section on environment management needs to be expanded and presented in greater deta
(including conditions under which a specified action may be needed). This is the single most important component
of the SEA and the DOR needs to be provided with as many envinmental management options as possible. That
does not mean that all options pre,nted need to be used. It only means that the DOR should be provided with a
relatively comprehensive collection of options from which a suitable subset of mag measures could be
CHOSEN that would apply to the particular subproject being prepared. Some examples of additional m _anme
measures that could be mentioned in the SEA include:
*      Use or presevation of vegetatie buffer zones between roads (new, undergoing sigifict
maintenance, significant improvement such resaling/gravsling, being widened, rebiat of subbase
or subgrade, etc) and surface water bodies;
*      Use and rehabilitation (once construction acdvities have bee completed and the coractor loaves
the site) of septic tans, including direction on frequency and handling of des_udgig;
*      Storage and disposal of solid (dometic) and constuction waste;
*      Methods to be used during trasport of mQaterals to reduce dust and flymg debris (mcluding
covering the material, and conditions when it would be necessary to trsport soil and crushed rock wet);
*      Conditions that would require restiction of contactor activities. These could include restictng
work to the daylight hours and limiting the size and frequency of any blastng that may be nede  to avoid
unacceptable noise and vibradon impacts. For exmple, noise sensitive areas where this might apply would
include areas of humn habitadon, hosphals, intensive livestock production, or areas where wildife may
be breeding;
*      Conditions that would justify black topping  of some sections of existing roads (as a seaate
subproject to be considered under the Credit or as additional work to be included under a subpojeac

because of an environmental impact- i.e. dust). This may be appropriate where roads to be imIpToved pass
through areas of human habitation (this was a suggestion, and a good one, made by the DOR environmental
group);
*      Measures, and idicative locations where such measur  would be appropriate, that may need to
be included in a subproject to promote pedestria  and road safety (fencing to contol pedestian and
livestock crossing, controlled cross-walks, over or underpas, pedetr  islands, etc).
8.            The emphasis given by IDA and the Bank to public participation in the preparation and impact
management of a loan or credit requires that the SEA include a separe section on this issue. The Public
Participation section of the SEA should present general suggestions of how the public could be involved and
influence subprojects under the proposed Credit. It should also identify the role of the Division Offices in the
implementation of a Public Pardcipation program. This section of the SEA need only present an appropriate level
of response to public involvement. This may only involve public notification and infrmation dsemination, and
an avenue whereby people affected by the project can present their concens and suggesdons to the DOR.
9.            Finally, envomentl management r      eons in the Appendix of the SEA, once it has
been updated and expanded, will need to be presented in as much detail as possible, given the time left to the
consultant. Measures in the anmex should include parameters that guide contac   in their application (e.g.,
locaton of camps from popuations centers, depths of material excavaton, area to be covered by exposed
earthworks, traffic control measures, etc) including possible bomnspenatiesassociaed with the contactual clauses.
The anmex should then provide enough baclground material for the Bank's legal and procurement departme  to
prepare the specific additdonal clauses to be incorporad i future mutena    contracts. Where physical
management measures are proposed, simple sketch drawings of the measures being suggested along with
conceptualized bill of quantites should be presnted, where appropnate. A proposed wording for clauses to be
included in draft contraor bidding documen (similar to the two already transmitted by the consultant to IDA and
the DOR) that would be relevant to contrt acdvities and constluction methods to be used should also be prepared
and attached to the SEA.
Environmental Monitorin Reauirements of the SEA
10.           The SEA needs to be more specific in the sections covaing requiremen  for envonmenta Input
into subproject construction supervision and long-term road m_. Monitoring of subprqjects under the
Credit will rest at both the Division and Depatment levels, and the SEA should suggest 'how and what" shoud
be done to ensure compliance with environmental management provisions in the constuction contract, and to ensure
that unexpected problems are not allowed to develop to the point that signficant en Irnmen  imnpact could result.
If monitoring detects previously unexpected poblems, there should be provision in the conactr's contract to allow
action to be taken immediately to remedy thm Te SEA needs to be slighy expanded to provide draft wording
for inclusion in "ntgency pxvisions" in bidding documents, or to allow prenion of possible altanative
methods of handling problems that may be identfied through monitorig by the DOR Envonment Unit, or as
a result of supervision undertake by the Divisional Eieer or Project Manager.
PART 2: Instituional S        of dth             Unit of DOR
11.           The SEA includes         ons forinstitutionalstrengtheningof theEnvionmental Unitmnder
the DOR's Planning Dirtorate. While these nons were found to be generally cceptable to the
Planning Directorate following prelimint discussions On the SEA, additional detail is needed. The following
recommendations were made during appraisal. The ultimate intionis that institutionalstengteingof the DO's

Environmental Unit, including both technical assistance and equipment, will be an integral part of the Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project.
Duties of an Environmental Unit in the DOR
12.           The responsibilities of the Environmental Unit could include:
I)     Environmentll liaison, training and support to the Divisional Engineer Offices of DOR, and to the
District Development Committee Eigineering Offices (on an "as needed" basis);
2)     Preparation, in cooperation with the Environmental Divisionof the National Planning Commission,
and periodic updating of guidelines for impact assessment, impact management and environmental
monitoring/supervision of road and bridge projects;
3)     Project Seenig as required under the SEA and as may be required in the future once
comprehensive (including all types of road projects) screening guidelines have been prepared and adopted;
4)     Preparation of any Initial Environmental Assessments that may be needed for the IDA's proposed
Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Ptoject, or perhaps in the future for any other project regardless of
whether or not it is funded by IDA or the Bank;
5)     Preparaton of consultant Terms of Reference for any Environmental Assessments (EA);
6)     Supervision and review of EAs prepared for road projects implemented by DOR;
7)     Securig clearance of EAs for DOR projects through EA presentation to the newly created and
empowered Enviromen  Council and/or donor (such as the IDA or the Bank);
8)     Monitoring of project Envionmental Management Plans to ensure that management measures are
being implemented as directed, and that the specified measures are as effective as originally thought. It
may be usefl to link this Department-level role with the corresponding need to monitor envuinental
impact of construction and operation of District Roads, which are under the control of the Distict
Development Committees;
9)     Post project environmental review.
13.           At present, there appear to be two assistant engineers within the Environmental Unit of the DOR,
one responsible for environental aspects and the other addressing bioengineeritg needs of the DOR. The
Divisional Engieerng position as head of the Environmental Unit is curffently being covered by the head of the
Planning Deparmet. All members of the Environenl Unit have been assigned responsibilities other than those
directly related to their envnmental duties. During Project appraisal concem regarding the need to have a full
time staff assigned to implement the SEA; the requirements of implementiAg the SEA for the Road Maintenance
and Rehabilitation Project (much less the other environmental duties menioned in paragrah 9) cannot be adequately
met by staff who are allocated to these duties on a part-time basis.
14.           This issue was highlighted in the SEA, which rcmmended that at least one full-time
environmental staff be appointed to the Enviomental Unit. As the Environmental Unit already exists, and because
there is already one person filling an assistant engineermg position in this Department, IDA believes that this
conditon has already been met. What is lacking is clear delegation of authority to the Environmental Unit.
15.           The staff respondble for environmental matters, and Indeed the department itself, needs a
more clearly deied structural progam and Ust of dudes within the Department. The suggestions presented
in pragraph 9, above, could be used to form the basis of a deted catalog of Department reponsibilies,
and would abo help In the preparion of a job desipfton for the assstant engineer cuny  assigned
environental responslblties in the DOR.

Environmental Unit Staff Develonment
16.           After clearly identifying the role of the Environmental Unit and the duties of the environmental
management specialist within it, it is essential that the Department and its staff be given any needed technical skills
and equipment. The Department is not currently able to implement the environmental management requirements
of the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project, as presented in the SEA. It is therefore necessary to include
equipment, technical assistance and training components within the credit so that the DOR can adequately implement
the SEA recommendations. The training and technical assistance components needed would include:
I)     Tranina:  A two to three month, concentrated training program in environmental impact
assessment for the person designated by DOR as its full-time enviromnental impact assessment specialist.
The lack of such a program in Nepal will require the DOR environmental specialist to be sent overseas.
One suitable program exists at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland and others that may be suitable could
be identified before Credit effectiveness. This training should be the main priority of envirornmental
strengthening component in the Credit and should be undertaken as soon as possible;
2)     Short-term Exuatri   Assistanee: The development of an IEE process and more detailed
guidelines for environmental (including social) impact management of road and bridge projects in Nepal.
The newly created Environmental Protection Committee and acceptance of National Environmental
Assessment Guidelines (recently passed by the Parliament) require each sectoral Ministry to prepare
guidelines in cooperation with the Environmental Division of the National Planning Commission (NPC).
This process has already been used to prepare sectoral guidelines for Forestry and Industry, and transport
has recently been prepared in draft form. It is suggested that upon the return of the DOR environmental
specialist from overseas training, an internationai expert on environmental management of road and bridge
impacts be retained for a period of atxroximatelv 3 months to assist in the further developing the nuidelines
and hel, the DOR Environmental Unit and the Environmental Division of NPC to start imWlementation.
The guidelines for EE to be prepared would expand upon and develop a more appropriate sectoral
orientation to the IEE matrix presented in the National Environmental Impact Assessment Guidelines of
1992. It would also present detailed description of the information required before the EE could be
completed. Likewise, the road and bridge envionmental guidelines would expand on the SEA, present
a more detailed project screening (including new, and more extensive rehabilitation and betterment projects)
process, a more detailed guide to road construction activities and related environmental impacts,
construction supervision and long term environmental monitoring methodologies for road projects, etc.
These expanded guidelines would concentrate on work in upland and mountainous areas of Nepal, and
would be written for use primarily by Divisional Engineers and DOR Project Managers;
3)     Divisional and Deuartmental Semioars: As necessary, once the IEE, road and bridge
environmental guidelines had been prepared, reviewed and adopted by DOR, the Ministry of Works and
Transport and the Environmental Protection Committee, six Regional seminars (one in each of Nepal's 6
Regions) should be held to present and explain the guidelines to Divisional Engineers and Project Managers
of the DOR. When the seminar is held in the Central Division- which contains Kahmandu- members of
the DOR should participate. Funding of the proposed seminars as presented in the attached table includes
an allowance to permit participation in the seminars by the Enviomnental Division of the NPC;
4)    PIriodIc LocalIExDa e Assisance: Finally, as explained in the SEA, specialist consultant
advice should be periodicatly made available to the Envronmenl Unit of DOR. The SEA suggests that
approximately 1 month per year over the life of the loan would be sufficient, and the consultant assistance
could come from either within or outside of Nepal. Topics for these one month consultancies should be
left open at present, as it is not certain exactly what will be required in the future. However, it does seem
essential that the first of these short consultancies should address traffic safety. It is anticipated that the



- 165 -
Annex 13
Page 6 of 6
assistance on traffic safety would not be required until at least the second year after loan effectiveness and
would generally involve review of the current status of road safety in Nepal. It should also identify any
gaps that may be present in the staff skills, equipment, guidelines for use and placement of road furniture,
institutional organization, etc, that relates to the handling of road safety in Nepal.
17.           The DOR receives considerable assistance in the "environmental sector" from the British Overseas
Development Administration (ODA). At present, this mainly deals with bioengineering, but may be expanded in
the future to include road safety and other areas of environmea management. Any consultancy assistance to the
DOR that originates from the IDA Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project must be coordinated with the
existing and budgeted ODA activities in DOR and other relevant government agencies in Nepal.
Iwlementation of the SEA by the Conractor
18.           The FIDIC guidelines specify that the contractor must prepare a plan for submission to the client
that details how environmental management measures specified in the contract (usually in only a general manner)
are to be implemented. It is expected that the DOR will apply this condition to contractors working on the Road
Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project.
19.           Since it is very unlikely that contractors chosen for work on subprojects under the Credit will have
either sufficient knowledge of envirnmental management of road projects, or of the environment in which work
is to be undetaken, it is essential that a staff from the DOR Environmental Unit be seconded to each relevant
contractor (the SEA should provide guidance here) for a period of approximately I month to help in the preparation
of this environmental management implementation plan.
Eciument and Other Assistance to the Environmental Unit of DOR
20.           The subprojects under the Road Maintenance and Rehabilitation Project are scattered throughout
Nepal. It is essental that the Environmental Unit staff have ready and reliable access to transport. The consultant
that is to assist the Departmen with the preparation of road and bridge, and IEE guidelines will also need transport
during his 3 month stay in Nepal. It is proposed that the Credit inclue purchase of a 4-wheel drive vehicle for use
by the consultant, which would then be turned over to the DOR Environmental Unit upon completion of his/her
assignment.
21.           The Credit should also include funding for books, periodicals and references relevant to
environmental management and monitoring of road infrastructure projects.

2.    SCOPE OF CONSULTANCY SERVICES
2.1    Gemal
The Consultant shall perform all engineering, fmancial analysis and related work as described
herein to attain the objectives of the Study and shall maintain close liaiscJ with the Deparnment
of Roads (DOR).
The DOR will provide the consultant with all relevant data and reports available but the
Consultant shall be entirely responsible for checking their correctness and for the analysis and
interpretation of all information received and for fte rmmndations and conclusions in their
report submissions.
2.2    Pta Review
The Consultant will collect and review available data on the DOR road network including, inter
alia
i)    current, prevalent and expected revised design standards for roads (pavement and
geometric) and bridges;
ii)    current technical specifications for constuton and maintenance of roads and bridges;
iii)   road and bridge rehabilitation design reports;
iv)   reports on road construction industry (e.g., N.D. Lea International, East Consult,
Contractor Association of Nepal and others);
v)    reports on local materials and soils;
vi)   existing data collected by various consultant teams (i.e., N.D. Lea International,
Roughton and Partners, Scott, Wilson and Kirkpatrick and MRCU) to include road
pavement condition surveys comprising visual condition (i.e., surface distress, drainage
and traffic ranges), roughness and deflection, CBR values on subgrades and borrow
materials, test pitting and sample testing of subbase, base and surfacing, including
thickness and CBR values;
vii) traffic and axle load surveys;
viii)bridge condition surveys and reports (including Bridge
Mangeme  System, Road Flood Rebabilitation Bridge Condition Surveys).
2.3       irfentorv of  M
i)    The Consultant will inventory road pavement and bridge materials currently available in
Nepal or which can be economically importod and which have potential for effective and
economic use in road and bridge construction, rehabilitation and maintenance;
The materias are to be classified according to their fundamental behavior into various
categories with different classes according to their strength chrcteristics;



- 172 -
Annex 16
Page 3 of 6
iV0    For each type of material the Consultant will list and map the main existing, known and
potential quarries for road construction purposes, sites or points of production and specify
their location, average anmnal production, potential production and reserves and establish
a unit cost. The Consultant will comment on the efficiency of production and the
feasibility of improvement. The Consultant will differentiate between terai (plains), hill
and mountain regions. If no reliable information exists on either the quality or the
quantity available the Consultant will collect samples, carry out such investigations,
surveys and laboratory testing as required for this evaluation;
iii)   This work will be carried out in two phases. In the first phase the Consultant will list
the data already available and prepare a program of site investigation and laboratory
study for the second phase with an estimate of the cost. With the approval of the DOR
the second phase will be implemented and the results incorporated in the inventory;
2.4 Road ftons#
2.4.1  AsesMt of Road  avkement Cosrction. Rebabilitation and Maintenance Tecaues
i)    The Consultant will define the pavement construction, rehabilitation and maintenance
techniques (improved subgrade, sub-base, base and surfacing layers) which have been
proved and used in Nepal, their results and suggestions regarding techniques that have
not been adopted but could make econonic sense if developed and adapted to Nepal's
conditions, taking into account the specia conditions prevailing in the three regions
including the Terai, hills and mountains;
ii)    For each of the techniques the Consultant shall compare the potential performance of road
and bridge construction materials, cost (including life cycle cost), advantages and
disadvantages, considering the implications for the use of equipment-baied or labor-based
technologies during construction and maintenance;
iii)   From the most cost effective techniques and with the approval of the DOR, the
Consultant will select for further study at least three techniques for improved subgrade,
four techniques for subbase and base and four techniques for surfacing. For each
technique in three different regions the Consultant will prepare and carry out a study
program of sample collection and field and laboratory tests which shall include, but not
be limited to, the following:
a)    for improved subgrade materils - soaked CBR values (at four days) and
unsoaked CBR values at three compaction levels and variable moisture content;
b)    for materials stabilized with lime, cement, hydrocarbon binders (bitumen, etc) -
compressive strength and stability;
c)    for mecbanically stabilized materials - particle size analysis, plasticity,
compaction and CBR values;
d)    for surfacing materials - (including crushed aggregate and river gravel available
in diferent regions) particle size analysis, plasticity, aggregate shape, size,
adsorption, abrasion, adhesion and cmshing strength, Marshall stability, flow and
air-voids, all as appropriate;
The consultant may dispense with some laboratory tests by a bibliographical reference



- 173 -
Annex 16
Page 4 of 6
if it can be established tbat the materis are equivalent to those for which reliable data is
available.
iv)    The Consultant may select to employ the services of the DOR Materials Laboratory at
their sandard schedule of rates. In cue DOR's facilities are not adequate the Consultant

i)    The Consultant will review the existng road classification and will in coordnaton with
MRCU adopt a road classification and geometric standards in vanous categories, defined
on the basis of importance traffic volume and consted standard, for three regions
including the Terai, hills and mountains;
i)    The Consultant will carry out the following for each category of road:
a)    selection of parameters (e.g. trffic flow conditions, low volume nuning speed,
vehicle operating cost, comfort and safety, clearances, permanence of the road
link impact on the region served) to define service levels and study their variation
range;
b)    defie target service levels per category;
c)    sdection of basic design paramet  (e.g. design speed, width of cross section
lements, crossll and superelevation, geometry of vehicles, vehicle dynamic and
opration paramets) and study their vanation range;
d)    from the service levels and basic design parameter data deduce and define
minirmu values for horizontl and vertical alignment, intersections and
clearances;
iii) The Consultant will then develop a road construction materials' guidelines which would
be considered by DOR at the time that MRCU would recommend a set of geomeic
design standards for roads and bndges based on least economic cost (vehicle opertng
cost plus construction and mintenance cost).
