PREFACE
1.   This is the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) for the Tarim Water Supply
Project in the Republic of Yemen, for which Credit 2170-YEM in the amount of SDR9.2
million or US$12.0 million equivalent was approved on June 28, 1990, signed on
February 6, 1991, and declared effective on November 4, 1991.
2.   The Project was closed on June 30, 1999, after it was extended once from its
original closing date of December 31, 1997. Due to the difficulties relating first, to the
merging of the water and sanitation authorities in both parts of Yemen and creation of an
integrated National Water and Sanitation Authority (NWSA) and later, the civil
disturbance of 1994, project implementation suffered major delays. At IDA's initiative,
the Project was restructured and the Development Credit Agreement (DCA) was
amended on September 8, 1997. By November 23, 1999 the Credit was fully disbursed.
3.   The ICR was prepared by Ms. Carmen Niethammer (Consultant), and necessary
inputs were provided by Messrs. and Mme. Josephine Masanque, Financial Analyst
(MNSID); Alex McPhail Senior Economist (MNSID); Somin Mukherji, Team Leader
(MNSID); and Ali Khamis, Operations Officer (MNCYE). The ICR was reviewed by
Messrs. Inder Sud, Country Director (MNCMS), Jean-Claude Villiard, Sector Director
(MNSID); Jamal Saghir, Sector Manager (MINSID); Amir Al-Khafaji, Lead Operations
Specialist (MNSID); and John Macgregor, Country Officer (MNCMS).
4.   Preparation for the ICR began during IDA's final supervision/completion mission
in June 1999. The report is based on material in the project files, discussions with the
Borrower, and information collected in the field. An ICR was also prepared by the
Borrower, a summary of which is provided in Annex 7.

Project at Risk at While the Project never received an official 'at-risk' rating, the success of the
any Time           Project was at times questionable given a number of external factors such as
unification of the two Yemens (1990), the Gulf War (1991), and the Civil War
(1994).

C. ASSESSMENT OF DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN
AND OF QUALITY AT ENTRY
1. Original Objective The primary objective of the Project was to increase the quantity and
improve the quality of water supply services in Tarim and adjacent villages. Other objectives
were to: (i) improve the Public Water Corporation's (PWC) operational efficiency and strengthen
its managerial capabilities; (ii) improve wastewater management; and (iii) strengthen the audit
profession in the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). The project objectives were
consistent with the Government's development priorities and IDA's assistance strategy for
Yemen. The Project was designed in response to the Government's request for IDA assistance to
provide adequate water supply services to Tarim and its surrounding villages, as the Tarim area
was the last major fast growing population center of the Hadramawt Governorate. Existing water
supply in this area was considered inadequate in quantity and below acceptable quality levels.
2. Revised Obiective  As a result of a Sector Portfolio Performance Review (SPPR) of
March/April 1995 and as part of the Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) of May
1995, the Project was restructured and GOY/IDA agreed on steps to improve project
implementation. On September 8, 1997, financial covenants were revised, and the DCA amended
accordingly. The original objectives were revised to: i) increase water production for Tarim and
adjacent villages; and ii) strengthen the management and financial performance of NWSA. The
restructured project also emphasized on measures to strengthen implementation and provide
support for the nascent sector reform agenda.
3. Original Components The water supply component of the Project was to include: (i)
drilling and equipping of a new bore field near Tanrm; (ii) constructing water storage reservoirs
and a new distribution system; (iii) supplying water meters, tools and operational equipment; (iv)
devising a manpower development and training program for PWC; and (v) providing technical
assistance for construction supervision and for establishing management information systems.
The sewerage component of the Project was to include: (i) a wastewater disposal demonstration
project; (ii) a study for sewerage services and updating of designs; and (iii) training for staff of
the Directorate General of Local Government (DGLG). The Project was also to provide training
of staff at the Central Organization for Control and Auditing (COCA) in accounting and auditing.
4.   Transition in the Institutional set-up During Project implementation, the institutional
set-up changed dramatically. At appraisal, PWC was the Project beneficiary and attention was
focussed on its Wadi Hadramawt Branch. The major part of the Project area (Tarim city) was
then managed by a private operator, Tarim Water Supply Company (TWSC). In accord with the
DCA, upon completion of the Project, the TWSC was supposed to be merged with PWC and
operate as a sub-branch of the Wadi Hadramawt Branch. During Project implementation, major
events that took place in the region including the unification of the two Yemens, the Gulf War
and the Civil War, resulted in significant changes of the institutional set-up; PWC's role was
taken over by NWSA. More recently (November 1999), contrary to the provisions of the DCA, a
new Tarim Branch was created out of the TWSC. In line with the sector reforms now in progress,
the Tarim Branch is to be corporatized and further private sector involvement will be sought
under a proposed Adaptable Program Credit (APC) for the water sector. In view of the above
developments, while the financial analysis (para. 18) was carried out for the Wadi Hadramawt
Branch, the economic analysis (para. 19) focussed on the Project area, i.e., the recently formed
Tarim Branch of NWSA.
5.   Revised Components  After restructuring (para 2), the revised Project components
included increasing the water supply and improving the quality of water supplied in Tarim and
adjacent villages, and strengthening of NWSA in certain specific areas; it also focussed on
institutional capacity building and initiated sector reforms. Given the interest of other donors in
the sewerage sector, the sewerage component was dropped and subsequently replaced by an

6.    Quality at Entry The performance rating for quality at entry of the ICR is satisfactory.
The Project was never subject to a QAG review. It's conceptual approach was based on IDA's
previous and ongoing experience with five ongoing PWC projects which were aimed at: (i)
providing potable water to major urban areas and rural growth centers; and (ii) strengthening the
institutional capacity of PWC through the adoption of sound technical, financial, and operational
policies. IDA had played a key role in the sector since 1978, when a Water Supply Engineering
Credit (S-21-YDR) financed feasibility studies for Aden, Al Mukalla, and Laboos. This was
followed by water supply projects in Aden, Al Mukalla, and Seiyun. Thus, the Project, as
conceived during preparation, was consistent with the Government's policies/priorities.
7.    Studies, which were financed under the Seyun Water Supply Project (Cr. 1418-YDR) to
locate and demonstrate the availability of sufficient groundwater resources and to prepare detailed
designs and tender documents for a Tarim Regional Water Supply Project, were completed in
1989 and forned the basis of this project.
8. The Project was the sixth major project to be undertaken by PWC with external financing. It
was noted at appraisal that a unification of PDRY and YAR could result in a reorganization of the
water supply and sewerage sector, yet it was not anticipated that this would significantly impact
on the scope or objectives of the Project or adversely affect its implementation. In line with IDA
safeguard policies, an environmental impact assessment was carried out under the restructured
project.
D. ACHIEVEMENT OF OBJECTIVE AND OUTPUTS
9.    Outcome/Achievement of Obiective   The ICR  assesses the project outcome as
satisfactory. The redesigned project achieved its major objectives of: (i) increasing the capacity
for potable water production and supply; and (ii) within certain areas, strengthening the
institutional capacity of the Borrower. The satisfactory outcome of the Project is based on the
following considerations:
10.  Increased Quantity and Quality of Water Provided - At Project closing, the water supply
in Tarim and adjacent villages increased with the completed drilling of seven wells and
construction of reservoirs, primary transmission pipeline and networks, and other facilities.



4
When the Project was restructured in 1995, NWSA agreed to increase the water production
capacity of 10,300 m3/day for Tarim  and adjacent villages by January 1998.  At project
completion, the water supply of Tarim has been increased to about 6,575 m3/day. Once the
secondary and tertiary works are completed, production is expected to reach the target supply.
11.  Strengthening of NWSA Achieved - To strengthen the institutional capacity of NWSA,
broad sector reforms were initiated in 1995, aiming at greater decentralization and delegation of
authority to functionally responsible staff. Under the Project, the following actions were taken to
improve NWSA's financial management: (a) a computerized payroll and billing system was
completed in October 1998; (b) a computerized accounting module has been installed in
accordance with the branch decentralization program; (c) 140 branch staff were trained in
computerized financial management with training of local staff (conducted by TEAM, Lebanon);
and (d) training of two management staff completed abroad (WTI). Further operational training
by consultants and contractors enabled staff to take over project operations more smoothly. IDA
technical assistance to NWSA/PWC was also complemented by the activities of other donors in
the water and sanitation sector. Thus, this institutional building objective was met.
12.   Poverty Alleviation and other Social Objectives Met - While the objective of alleviating
poverty was not specifically spelled out in the SAR, it always was an integral part of the Project.
Yemen has the region's lowest life expectancy (51 years) and the highest infant mortality rate
(11.7% of live births).  A leading cause of infant/child mortality is diarrhea, partly caused by
unhygienic water and poor sanitation facilities. Thus, the Project was supposed to provide an
adequate supply of potable water for about 53,000 people in Tarim and adjacent villages
(including 22,000 inhabitants considered to be at, or below, the poverty level). At project
completion, the immediate poverty alleviation impact of the Project is higher than expected.
According to the Borrower's latest estimates, 55,900 people (an increase of about 3% from SAR
projections) will be directly benefiting from the Project. An increase of access to safe water, not
only contributes to overall poverty alleviation, but also has an important impact on the lives of
women. Before the Project, local women in adjacent villages were known to have spent 4-5
hours daily for manually fetching water and carrying it on donkeys for great distances. Many of
these women now have easy access to standpipes providing abundant clean water. Not only has
this freed up a substantial amount of their time for more productive activities, it also makes them
stakeholders in sustainable water resources management.
13.  Environmental Objectives Met - The Project provided additional clean water for the
people of Tarim and adjacent villages, and has contributed to the improved health and living
conditions of the population. Health hazards associated with inadequate water for personal
hygiene and potable water of poor quality were reduced. Under this project, an environmental
impact assessment study was included at the time of restructuring in July 1995; the study was
meant to cover the sewerage aspects as well.  It analyzed in accordance with Yemeni
Environmental Legislation the existing situation of water supply and sanitation projects in the
Tarim and Seiyun areas in the Wadi Hadramawt Governorate. The study deals thoroughly with
the positive and negative impacts of the Project on the environment, in particular concerning
income, employment, housing and urban development, health and safety. Several options are
considered for the mitigation measures aimed at protecting the environment from negative
impacts. The report made valuable recommendations for long-term mitigation measures to be
taken into account by the Government and donors active in the water and sanitation sector. IDA
provided comments on the report and also outlined short-term mitigation measures that reflected
Tarim's current level of development.
14.  Economic Rate of Return Sustained - The Project's estimated economic rate of return is
above 11%, and is close to IDA's usual minimum requirement for a satisfactory project. Two
important and counterbalancing issues need to be considered when assessing this estimate for
sustainability purposes. First, are those items which the EIRR quantified and how well the



5
Project actually achieved the projections. Examples here are the level of tariffs and the degree to
which all the components are eventually completed. Second, the EIRR calculation did not
capture the substantial positive health and environmental benefits from project implementation.
Therefore, and holding other factors constant, the EIRR of 11% is likely understated. A fuller
discussion of the EIRR analysis follows (para. 20).
Output by Components
15.  Sector Policies: Several studies were conducted under the Project which contributed to a
better understanding of the overall water and sanitation sector needs of Yemen. In 1995, in order
to improve the management of the water sector and strengthen  NWSA, the GOY (in
collaboration with IDA and other donors) initiated a sector refonn program expected to be
implemented over a ten year period. The Sector Policy and Strategy Study draft (financed under
this project) was the theme of a workshop held in January 1996, which led to the first public
discussion of the government program on water supply and sanitation sector reform. This study
facilitated a cabinet approval (resolution 237/1997) of the country's comprehensive strategy for
the sector and helped lay the groundwork for a new "water law" now under parliamentary
discussion. Under this resolution, branches of NWSA are to be decentralized and accorded full
autonomy in a phased manner. This would enable regional water and sanitation corporations to
be established and operated on a commercial basis, which will improve the delivery of water
supply and sanitation services. In this context, on November 8, 1999, a Ministerial Decree
(1 70/1999) established Tarim as an independent branch which is an initial step in the formation of
a future regional corporation.
16.  Physical Objectives: Physical works completed under the Project were: (i) drilling and
equipping of seven boreholes at Dammun; which is expected to result in increased water supply
to 6,575 m3/day; (ii) construction of five water storage reservoirs with a total capacity of 3,800m3;
(iii) installation of 50,000 meters of new primary network; (iv) construction of an administrative
building; (v) installation of mechanical and electrical equipment including a 500 kVA diesel
generator, and (vi) overhead 1 1-kV electrical line connections to the Dammun boreholes.
According to the original implementation plan, the construction of pipelines and minor structures
was to be completed by NWSA within two years after the Credit Closing Date. Hence, some
works financed directly by the Government are still ongoing. For example, 260,000 meters of
pipelines were procured for rehabilitation of old pipes and installation of new pipelines necessary
for the secondary and tertiary network in Tarim and adjacent villages. The Government has
committed to an Action Plan whereby these works will be completed by June 2001. The Wadi
Hadramawt Branch has been contracted to complete the pipe laying activity, and, as of November
1999, about 1500 m of pipes have been laid. Borrower's commitment to complete its obligations
will be monitored and should be taken into account when IDA considers future lending in the
sector.
17.  Institutional Development Components: Under the Project, some aspects of NWSA's
management performance were strengthened.  These included improvements to financial
management and computerization at NWSA headquarters and the Wadi Hadramawt Branch. The
sector reform initiatives carried out under the Project, including the key study referred to earlier
(para. 15) also made a significant contribution to the govemment's overall initiatives to strengthen
sector institutions.
18.  Financial Management and audit reporting  Since 1991-92, with the unification, and
emergence of NWSA, the Wadi Hadramawt Branch experienced unclear lines of authority,
accountability and responsibility particularly in its financial and accounting department; this trend
still continues. There is an overlap in the accounting, financial management, planning, budgeting
and computer systems between the Branch and NWSA headquarters. The accounts between the



6
Branch and the headquarters are not regularly reconciled. There is no cost accounting system,
which is vital to sound financial management and accounting system as well as tariff setting.
Overall, there is no transparency in the system, thus the financial data are inadequate for proper
financial assessment; on the whole the financial management of the Branch is weak and
unsatisfactory. NWSA produces combined financial statements for all branches, which were
delayed throughout project implementation, resulting in late issuance of audit reports by about
18-36 months after the close of a fiscal year. The auditor's opinion has been consistently
qualified, as the Branch cannot take any action without the approval of COCA and the NWSA
headquarters.
19.  Financial Performance The underlying tensions of the merger reflect broader anxieties
on the Wadi Hadramawt Branch's bleak financial performance; from 1993 to 1998, it
continuously incurred annual losses. The financial performance indicators were reviewed for
broad trends rather than detailed findings due to unreliable data obtained given the weak financial
management system and lack of qualified staff. The assets and loans are not properly revalued,
write-offs are not practiced, accounts reconciliation are not done, and accounts receivables are
high, which result in misleading financial indicators. At the end of FY98, accounts receivable
remained at about seven months as opposed to a target level of three months; the major
defaulters were the Government-owned entities and ministries. As of 1999, the Ministry of
Finance, the Ministry of Electricity and Water, Yemen Petroleum Corporation and NWSA agreed
to settle past arrears by offsetting each others accounts. This agreement is expected to improve
the arrears in 1999 and thereafter. Because of the turbulent setting against which this project
survived, the ICR did not attempt to draw a comparison with the financial perfornance of the
former PWC or NWSA, as this is no longer applicable. Annex l(b) provides a summary on the
financial health of the Wadi Hadramawt Branch. The detailed financial statements of the Branch
are provided in the project files (Annex 8).  In a sharp contrast to the dismal financial
performance of the Wadi Hadramawt Branch, the TWSC, in operation for over 30 years, made
net profits every year. Despite the current very high level of UFW (55%) caused primarily due to
old network connections, net profits increased by over 100% during the period 1973-1997. It is
therefore anticipated that once rehabilitation of the distribution network is completed, the current
level of UFW will reduce significantly, thereby making the newly established Tarim Branch
financially more sound. With this background, it would seem justified that the Tarim Branch has
been established as a branch separate from the Wadi Hadramawt Branch. The ongoing sector
reforms and IDA's possible future involvement through a proposed APC (para. 4) could help the
Tarim Branch operate on more sound commercial principles in the future which will be more
attractive for private sector participation
20.  Financial and Economic Internal Rates of Returns In the appraisal report, the financial
Internal rate of return of the Project was estimated at 9 percent.' The analysis was briefly
described in the SAR: benefits were to accrue solely from the incremental revenues at current
tariffs over the estimated life of the project; expenditures included periodic equipment
replacements and incremental operating costs. However, for the ICR, the economic analysis
carried out used a "with and without project" methodology. Contrary to the assumption during
appraisal (TWSC to be taken over by the Wadi Hadramawt Branch), at the time of writing this
report, the TWSC was converted to the Tarim Branch, separate from the Wadi Hadramawt
Branch of NWSA. The focus of the economic analysis was appropriately adjusted to analyze the
activities of the Tarim Branch operating in the Project area as opposed to the incremental
costs/benefits associated with the operations of the Wadi Hadramawt Branch (as conceived
during appraisal).
l No explanation was given in the SAR for the project being approved with an estimated ERR below 10
percent. However, the SAR indicates that this would be the mninimum rate of return "since the
quantification of environmental and health benefits is not possible".



7
21.  The main assumptions for the economic analysis are: (i) an increase in raw water of about
2.8 million m3/year as a result of the project's civil works; (ii) the tariff is the same as that
approved in December 1998, and then projected for later years according to IDA's agreement
with the Government under the recently negotiated Sana'a Water Supply & Sanitation Project
(Cr. 3209-YEM), which the Government has been using as the defacto national tariff including
for the Tarim Branch; (iii) the number of connections increase as predicted in the SAR; (iv)
investment costs are actual amounts, as shown in Annex 2A; and (v) UWF decreases 1 percent
per year in the with project scenario (from 55 to 32 percent) and increases by one percent per year
without the project (starting at 55 percent and capped at 60 percent). The discount rate used in
the NPV calculation is 10 percent, and the period of analysis is 25 years. Over 98 percent of the
Project's cost were used in the analysis (only Training and Technical Assistance, US$260,00,
were excluded). The base year is 1998-the latest year for which audited financial statements
were available for the TWSC (now the Tarim Branch).
22.  Based on this analysis, the Project's estimated net financial internal rate of return is II
percent, with the financial NPV estimated at YR 355 million (US$2.4 million). The effects of a
FOREX premium were examined to convert financial to economic flows, but this calculation had
a negligible effect on the NPV and ERR (11 percent and YR 339 million (US$2.3 million),
respectively). As in the SAR, health and environmental benefits were not calculated.
E. MAJOR FACTORS AFFECTING IMPLEMENTATION AND OUTCOME
Factors outside the control of the Government and Implementing Agency
23.  Three important exogenous factors adversely affected implementation of the country's
water portfolio; this included the Project. First was the unification of the two Yemens (in 1990)
which resulted in large scale organizational upheaval. Next was the Gulf war (in 1991) which
resulted in a sharp deterioration in the country's financial resources and investment capacity.
Finally, the country experienced a brief civil war (in 1994) which further disrupted the Project's
implementation progress.
Factors generally subject to Government control:
24.  Two important factors under government control affected project implementation. First,
and especially after unification, the government was preoccupied with the broader issues related
to the merging of the two Yemens and forthcoming elections, to the detriment of addressing
economic and sectoral policy issues. Hence, insufficient attention was given to resolving
organizational, managerial, and financial issues in the water sector. Second, the government was
much too slow to address the Branch's deteriorating financial condition. Throughout the
Project's implementation period, changes in tariff were necessary to keep pace with salary
increases, operational and investment costs, as well as to cover for the cumulative effect of
customer arrears (for which there was no write-off policy). Despite the need for remedial actions
for the four years between July 1992 and 1996, there was no increase in tariffs. After July 1996,
another two years passed before the next increase was effected in December 1998, which was a
result of IDA's appraisal of the Sana'a Water Supply and Sanitation Project (Cr. 3209-YEM). By
the time of Project closing, weighted average tariffs were still about 16% below that required to
meet the Credit's financial covenant (YR 31/cum vs. YR 37/cum).
Factors generally subject to implementing agency control
25.  NWSA's performance as the implementing agency was less than satisfactory. Inordinate
delays in procurement matters were common throughout the Project implementation period.
Often, the supply of counterpart funds was a problem, yet NWSA took little initiative in
addressing this issue. Finally, frequent changes in NWSA management, including headquarter



8
anchors for the Project, led to a steady deterioration in the coordination and leadership necessary
for satisfactory implementation.
26.  Costs and Financin2    Total project costs including contingencies, at appraisal was
US$15.15 million equivalent; this included a foreign exchange component of US$12.00 million
(about 83 percent of total project costs). Counterpart funding was to be provided by the
PWC/Govemment for the balance. The costs of the Project at restructuring (July 1995) were
estimated to reach the equivalent of US$17.94 million. By the Closing Date, actual costs are
estimated at US$15.22 million, which is about the same as estimated at appraisal (Annex 2). The
difference between the estimate at the time of restructuring and the actual costs was primarily due
to lower than expected bid prices for civil works contracts for the two major project components
(wellfield and materials for distribution works). Project financing at the Closing Date for both the
GOY and IDA was within four percent of the SAR estimates (Annex 2c)
F.   SUSTAINABILITY
27.  Rationale for Sustainability Rating  Short-term sustainability is likely to be achieved,
especially as some works (secondary/tertiary networks) will continue until 2001 under close
supervision and direction of the Wadi Hadramawt Branch. As these works are completed, the
Tarim Branch is expected to be financially more viable, given the adoption of the recently
increased national tariff and improved revenue collections (which are expected to be attained
soon after the branches achieve necessary autonomy). Long-term sustainability will, in large part,
depend on the Branch retaining this autonomy and achieving enduring financial health. However,
this would appear both possible and likely as long as reforms of the sector remain on track.
28.  Threats to the Project's sustainability stem mainly from the degree to which the Branch
embraces its newly acquired autonomy and accompanying accountability. If remedial measures
are not taken to improve UFW, reduce costs, enhance revenues through timely tariff adjustments
and better collection policies, the long-term viability of the Project will be undermined.
29.  Transition Arrangements to Regular Operation  There are few transition issues under
this Project.  The installed civil works are not complex and satisfactory operations and
maintenance of these is well within the capacity and experience of the existing staff. The
Govemment has committed itself to an Action Plan, whereby remaining works will be completed
by June 30, 2001. Installation of pipelines have been covered in the Operational Plan (see Aide
Memoire, Annex 8) agreed with the Borrower and will be followed up on a regular basis as part
of supervision mission of other IDA financed projects. Finally, IDA has advised the Borrower
that its commitment to complete these obligations will be monitored and taken into account when
IDA considers future lending operations in the sector.
G. IDA AND BORROWER'S PERFORMANCE
30.  IDA Lending Performance  IDA performance was satisfactory during identification,
preparation and appraisal. Dunrng these stages, IDA had been able to take advantage of its
familiarity with PDRY's water sector, having played an important role in strengthening PWC's
organizational and operational capabilities through ongoing projects at the time. IDA staff
initially assisted PWC in project preparation, later it assisted NWSA in restructuring the Project
and preparing the institutional reformn program in the water sector initiated by the Govemment in
coordination with other donors.
31.  IDA Supervision Performance  Throughout the long implementation of the project,
supervision missions were carried out on a regular basis (Annex 4a provides further infornation
on staff skill mix and continuity). Supervision and monitoring of project implementation was
satisfactory. Despite initial poor implementation performance and continued non-compliance



9
with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement, IDA took deliberate decisions in not
invoking remedies available to it under the Credit Agreement. This was done as part of a strategy
to support Yemen's effort in overcoming the difficulties faced during the period following
unification of the two Yemens in 1990 to the end of the Civil War in 1994. Supervision and
monitoring were further improved once the World Bank Resident Mission in Sana'a was
established in November 1995.
32.  Overall IDA Performance  IDA's overall performance for this project was satisfactory.
Strength and weaknesses in IDA's performance mostly centered around its reaction to the
external shocks of unification, the Gulf War, and the Civil War. On the one hand, IDA
steadfastly supported the project during these difficult periods. On the other hand, it could have
been more proactive in its supervision efforts, or could have restructured earlier when
implementation was much delayed.
33.  Borrower Preparation Performance   Government's performance in preparing the
Project was satisfactory. In particular, during preparation the Government helped to ensure the
Project's financial viability by agreeing that the bulk water purchases from the Hiswa Power and
Desalination Plant would be at a cost not to exceed the average NWSA tariff (approximately
1/10 of the plant's actual production cost).
34.  Government Implementation Performance Government's implementation performance
was partially satisfactory. Initially, the Project suffered from the slow provision of counterpart
funds, low tariffs, and a lack of movement on sector reforms. However, by project end, the
Government had either adequately addressed these concerns (tariff and counterpart funding) or
made significant progress (sector reforms) in overcoming them.
35.  lmplementing Agencv Performance NWSA's performance was less than satisfactory:
NWSA was slow to address the deteriorating financial situation of the Wadi Hadramawt Branch;
it was often slow to execute procurement and payments; construction suffered long delays (even
without taking into account the external shocks); NWSA accomplished little in the way of
institutional strengthening, and it provided little, if any, policy guidance to the Branch. Further,
by project completion, none of the Credit's significant covenants had been met (see Annex on
Covenant compliance included in the completion mission aide-memoire).
36.  Overall Borrower Performance  Although, performance of NWSA was less than
satisfactory, the project was completed on schedule through active collaboration of the various
partners. Thus, the overall performance of the Borrower has been rated as satisfactory. The
Project was supported by both the central and local governments, as well as by the people of
Tarim and adjacent villages. The main reasons for the poor implementation performance was the
organizational, managerial, and staff changes resulting from the Government's decision to
consolidate the two public utilities. Offsetting the effects of this, the Project Management Unit
(PMU), which performed well despite occasional staff constraints.
H. LESSONS LEARNED
I. Project Design Lessons
a) In order to ensure long term sustainability of the investments made, up-front institutional
arrangements should be agreed upon (as currently being adopted for the Sana'a Water Supply
and Sanitation Project);
b) More emphasis should be laid on a balanced investment (implying a balance between
production, distribution systems and its operations and maintenance activities). IDA should
therefore finance complete works rather than finance supply items and leave the installation
part to the Borrower (as it was done in this project);



10
c) Project design should ensure proper follow-up arrangements of the project beyond its closing
date;
d) In general, and with the commitment of the Borrower, water projects should ensure adequate
provision for complementary sewerage systems; and
e) Sufficient implementation and financial authority needs to be delegated to the Project
Management Unit.
II. Policy Lessons
a) NWSA branches that have full autonomy to manage their affairs on a self-financing basis
perform better;
b) Without financial self-sustainability, the Tarim Branch will find it very difficult to mobilize
finances needed for future investments;
c) An up-front agreement with the Borrower on implementing financial and institutional reforms
will contribute significantly to project sustainability; and
d) The performance of this Project, especially regarding its institutional and financial aspects,
confirms the need for a broad-based and comprehensive sector reform which emphasizes
autonomy and private sector participation.
III. Implementation Lessons
a) Close supervision by field staff and a flexible response to changing conditions can improve
the implementation of a project that is facing serious implementation problems;
b) Delays in providing local currency funds can cause serious interruptions in project
implementation and must be adequately addressed at an early stage;
c) Close cooperation with the Government and donors improves project implementation;
d) Institutional strengthening, including up-front improvements in financial, accounting and
management systems (as anticipated under sector reforms of the Borrower), increases
efficient project implementation and the long-term sustainability of project benefits;
e) Once unsatisfactory ratings were maintained for more than one year, IDA should have been
more proactive in managing/restructuring the Project. and
f) In order to sharpen implementation focus, project implementation should be confined to 4-5
years.

Borrower's Implementation Completion Report Summary
Objectives:
The signing of the Credit for the Tarim Water Supply Project coincided with the
declaration of the Unified Yemen, for this reason it can be considered the first IDA
lending operation for Water Supply to the Republic of Yemen.
The major project objectives are :
a)  to increase the quantity and improve the quality of the water supply services
in Tarim and adjacent villages.
b)  to strengthen the operational, accounting and managerial capacity of NWSA .
The Project aimed to build on initiatives under other ongoing IDA projects, to
improve NWSA's operational efficiency. Overall these objective were met satisfactorily.
The Project has financed the preparation of a "Sector Policies and Strategy Paper",
an "action plan" for improving financial management and computerization of NWSA,
and an Environmental Impact Assessment Study (EIA) based on which various activities
are ongoing.
Implementation Experiences and Results.
a)   Experience:
The Project execution was generally satisfactory in spite of the necessity to extend
the original closing date of December 31, 1997, by 18 months.
The main factors which led to implementation delays were the evolved
circumstances after reunification of Yemen and the merging of the Public Water
Corporation (PWC) in the South with the National Water and Sewerage Authority
(NWSA) in North, the creation of an integrated National Water and Sanitation Authority
(NWSA), and later the civil disturbance in Yemen in 1994.
All of the works were carried out by contractors under ICB method of procurement
which enabled the execution of all the project components within the original project cost
estimate though the implementation was delayed by several years. Some of the needed
operational equipment could not be procured under the Credit due to lack of funds.
These are the vehicles, the laboratory equipment, communication equipment and office
equipment.

b)   Results:
The Project was successful in meeting its primary objective of increasing the
quantity and improving the quality of the water supply services in Tarim and near by
villages.
The NWSA Wadi Hadramout branch has taken over the responsibility of
operating the new water supply system in Tarim, and a sub branch has been established.
The Branch has computerized its accounts, replaced all non working meters, installed
new meters on all the non metered connections, and has trained its staff on financial and
management aspects.
Plans for Future Operations and Sustainability.
NWSA Wadi Hadramout Branch has already been operational for more than 10 years
now; and has gained experience in operating water supply systems in Seiyun, Shibam,
and Al-Qatn districts .
The branch has taken over the responsibility of operating and maintaining the Tarim
water supply system and adopted an organization and administrative structure similar to
that applied for Shibam and Al-Qatn. NWSA has already made available the required
staff and the technical and financial resources needed for its operations in Tarim. Most of
the staff needed are taken from the Tarim National Water Company, which ceased its
operations in Tarim.
It is likely that the Project will sustain the achievements generated in relation to its
primary objective and continue to supply adequate good quality water to Tarim town and
near by villages.
Key lessons learned:
a)   It was possible to complete all the project components within the overall
original (as appraised) cost estimate only because of the participation of
local contractors. Clear selection criteria for local contractors should be set
to ensure that only qualified capable contractors be allowed to participate in
tendering for large water supply and sanitation projects .
b)    Training components should be more defined at the appraisal stage with
more emphasis be given to the Project's training needs. NWSA needs to
give continued attention to the training of its staff in operations and
management including project management in order to improve monitoring
progress and minimize delays in project implementation. More autonomy in
decision-making and more control of the Project's local and foreign
resources and funds should be given to the P.I.U..

c)    Agreed financial and other covenants are to be made clear to all concerned
personnel in NWSA and should be translated into the Arabic language and
passed over by NWSA H.Q. to the concerned branch departments for
compliance.
d)    When significant changes occurred (such as the unification, followed by the
transitional period, and the civil disturbances in 1994, the merging of two
water authorities with rather different policies and procedures, and large
local currency fluctuations), the impact of all these changes should have
been evaluated carefully with appropriate adjustment made at the right time.
