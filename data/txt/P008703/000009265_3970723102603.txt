ROMANIA - CIMPULUNG-MUSCEL POLYESTER PROJECT (LOAN 1448-RO)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HIGHLIGHTS
The project is part of the overall Romanian strategy for the
development of the chemical and petrochemical industry which encourages
projects that produce more complex, higher value-added downstream chemicals
*         (para 2.04).  The plant's polyester fiber output is intended mainly for the
domestic market in the textile and clothing industries, while only small
quantities may be exported in the first years of operation. The production
of polyester chips is entirely destined to the domestic market. However, a
substantial portion of the fiber output is subsequently exported in the
form of fabrics, garments and other finished textile products (para 2.05).
The project which is located at Cimpulung Muscel is based on a
modern, continuous production process to reduce operating costs and to
ensure uniform product quality. The project includes a continuous
polyester polymerization plant of an annual capacity of 47,200 tons, a
polyester line to produce 15,000 tons per year of chips for filament yarn
and three spinning and drawing lines with capacities of approximately
10,500 tons per year for the production of cotton-type polyester staple,
wool-type tow and tops and flax-type polyester staple (paras 2.06 and
2.08).
The project was commissioned over an 18-month period starting
June 1981 and it was completed with 26 months' delay (para 3.13). The
delay was mainly due to delays in (i) delivery of local equipment, in part
as a result of the fact that specialized equipment was manufactured locally
for the first time based on documentation and specifications supplied by
licensor and technology suppliers; and (ii) design and engineering work
caused by differences between the systems of standards used by the
different suppliers and licensor. Considering the high level of technology
transfer achieved, the project implementation is, however, considered
reasonable.
Capacity utilization was 40X in 1982 and it is expected to reach
90% in 1983 and full operation in 1984. The project cost amounted to
USS124.8 million, 3.2% below appraisal estimate. Because of revaluation of
the Lei during implementation, the cost expressed in Lei is significantly
different and is 18.4% lower than the estimate at appraisal. The savings
were registered in most cost categories of expenditures: civil works,
licenses and engineering, technological tests and are mainly due to
favorable price developments and efficient implementation (paras 3.17 and
3.18).
The FRR for the project was calculated at 5.6% as compared to
4.7% estimated at appraisal. The increase in product prices has more than
compensated for the higher unit cost of inputs and the delays in project

completion (para 5.03). The ERR was calculated at 14.2% as compared to
15.6% estimated at appraisal. The slightly lower return is due to the
completion delay and the current depressed economic price for polyester
(para 6.03).
Early supervision proved beneficial in completing all
arrangements for the proper engineering and technology acquisition, and in
developing adequate procurement procedures. However, a long time war
required to negotiate the supply of the main technology package with
suppliers to obtain a price consistent with estimated costs, obtain
information on technology and to minimize the foreign content of the
package.  While much of the implementation delay was due to local
manufacture of equipment based on a new technology, overall transfer of
technology achieved in this project is deemed successful but at the cost of
delayed start-up (paras 7.04 and 7.05).



ROMANIA - CIMPULUNG-MUSCEL POLYESTER PROJECT
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The rapid development of chemical industries has been one of the
salient features of the long-term policies of the Government of Romania.
This policy has been largely designed to increase the value added to the
country's petroleum and natural gas resources through the vertical
*         integration of its basic petrochemical industries and the production of
finished consumer goods.
1.02      In the pursuance of this policy, the Government has established
second-tier petrochemical plants to make intermediate products such as
dimethyl terephtalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol (EG), and production of
synthetic fibers was started in 1960 to supply the country's expanding
textile industry. Consumption of synthetic fibers In Romania increased
very rapidly (more than ten fold) between 1965 and 1975 and continued
growing through 1982 at an average rate of 8.3Z annually.
1.03      The Cimpulung-Muscel Polyester Project (the "Cimpulung Project-
or the 'Project") is part of the Government's effort described above to
integrate the production of the petrochemical and the textile industries.
The responsibility for the local manufacture of synthetic fibers is vested
in the Savinesti Industrial Central (the "Savinesti Central' or the
"Central") under the Ministry of Chemical Industry.
II. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A. Project Preparation, Appraisal and Loan Approval
2.01      Following a request from the Government, a Project Identification
Mission visited Romania in April 1976. One of the three projects
identified as suitable for Bank financing in the chemical sector was the
Cimpulung Project, the scope of which had been determined by the Government
in its 1976-80 Five-Year Plan.
2.02      The Project was pre-appraised in July 1976 and appraised in
September 1976 on the basis of a draft techno-economic study prepared by
the Savinesti Central and the Technological Engineering and Design
Institute for Chemical Industry (IITPIC). The main process and engineering
features of the Project were discussed with the Bank during appraisal as
well as in the early stage of the Project's implementation. Although there
was already one polyester plant operating in Romania in 1970, its capacity
was insufficient to meet demand and the batch technology used was more



- 2 -
expensive to operate and did not ensure the same degree of product
uniformity obtainable by using the modern continuous polymerization
process. The appraisal ulsuion had detalled discusmions on the Project's
estimated capital cost, export possibillties and procurement procedures
and, during appraisal, visited the Government agencies dealing with the
marketing and utilization of the Project's expected output as well as the
enterprises having the capability to manufacture equipment for the Project.
2.03      In March 1977, negotiations between the Romanian authorities and
the Bank took place and on June 7, 1977, the Bank's Executive Directors
approved a loan of USSSO.O million to the Investment Bank (IB or the
'Borrower") at an interest rate of R.22 to be on-lent to an enterprise to
be formed for the execution and operation of the Project. The Loan's term
was for 15 years including three years of grace. IB on-lent proceeds of
the Loan to the enterprise at the same 8.22 Interest rate as charged by the
lank. The Loan became effective on October 3, 1977.
B. Project Description and ObJectives
2.04      As mentioned above, the Cimpulung plant In part of the overall
Romanian strategy for the development of the chemical and petrochemical
industry, placing decreased emphasis on the production of basic chemicals
and encouraging projects that produce more complex, higher value-added
downstream chemicals-.
2.05      The plant's polyester fiber output is destined mainly for the
domestic market In the textile and clothing industries; only small
quantities may be exported during the first years of operation. The
production of polyester chips is entirely destined to the domestic market.
However, a substantial proportion of the Romanian synthetic fiber output is
subsequently exported in the form of fabrics, garments and other finished
textile products.
2.06      The Cimpulung Project comprises:
(a) A 47,20n tpy continuous polyester polymerizatlon plant
(originally planned for 46.700 tpy).
(b) A 15.2no tpy polyester line to produce chips for filament yarn.
(c) Three spinning and drawing lines with capacities of approximately
ln,5nn tpy each for the production of cotton-type polyester
staple, wool-type tow and tops, and flax-type polyester staple.
(d) Infrastructure and utilities, including two 4MW steam turbines,
boilers w'th total capacity of 150 tons/hour, water supply
svstem, etc.
(e) Pollution control and waste recoverv installations.
(f) Laboratorv and naintenance equipment.



2.07      The Project is located at Cimpulung Muscel, in the Arges judet,
about 50 km north of Pitesti and 160 km northwest of Ploiesti, the two
major petrochemical centers in Romania, which supply feedstocks to the
Project. The site is connected to the national rail and road necwork,
which facilitates supplying the Project with raw materials and access to
markets. The Project is based on a modern, continuous production process,
that results in low operating costs and ensures uniform product quality.
2.08      Raw materials required to manufacture polyester are ethylene
glycol (EG) and dimethylterephtalate (DMT) or pure terephtallc acid (PTA).
The latter is the preferred feedstock at present because of lower costs but
at the time the project was designed, there was already one plant in
operation and one under construction in the Pitesti and Ploiesti
petrochemical complexes, where EG was also being produced. Thus, the
choice of technology for this project Is considered correct. Utilities
required for the plant are ensured as follows: (i) electric power (120,310
MWh/yr) supplied from the captive power plant (72,500 MWh) and the national
grid (47,R10 MWh); (ii) process steam frem its own power plant, using fuel
oil as energy source; and (iii) water supplied from the nearby Tirgu river.
I1I.   PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A. Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The Project was commissioned over a period of 18 months starting
in June 1981. Capacity utilization was 40% in 1982 and, in 1983, it Is
expected to reach 90Z. The IB had repaid 252 of the loan on schedule by
June 19R3. As shown in para 5.03, starting in 1983, debt service is
covered by the Project's cash-flow generation.
h. Project Scope Changes
3.02      There has been no Important change In the overall Project scope:
onlv two minor changes in the Project scope have taken place: (1) an
increase in capacity from 46,7nO tpy to 47,200 tpy attained without change
in equipment design, and (ii) a higher use of electric power generated in
the Project's power plant. There is also the likelihood that, because of
some variations in actual demand, the proportion of final products -
cotton, wool and flax-tvpe fiber - will depart from the values assumed at
the time of appraisal. The equipment has been designed to ensure product
mix flexibility.
C. Project Management
I.fil     The Project was implemented under the general management of the
Cimpulting-Muscel Polyester Fiber Enterprise (the Enterprise) established in
June 1977 within the Savinesti Industrial Central under the Ministry of
Chemical Industrv. The Central has the general responsibility for chemical
fiber production and supplv in Romania, at the same time is providing
technical assistance to its enterprises. Project implementation followed



-4-
normal practice in Romania. The Enterprise served as the overall project
coordinator and was thus responsible for Project implementation and
completion. However, taking into account the complexity of the Project and
the specific works required, several areas of project execution were
delegated to other specialized organizations, according to the terms of
contracts concluded with them. The main participating agencies are
described in the following paragraph.
3.04      IITFIC, the engiaeering and design institute under the Ministry
of Chemical Industry, was responsible for the general design of the
Project, technical selection of any foreign technology and equipment,
overall site layout of the Project, construction design and detailed                    ^
engineering (based on the information provided by the main technology/
equipment and license supplier). Responsibility for all foreign
procurement (including technology, equipment and know-how) originally
rested with the Import Agency for Chemical Equipment and Technology
(ROMCHIM). This function has now been merged with the responsibility for
exporting chemical industry goods and services through a larger agency:
the Industrialexporcimport Foreign Trade Enterprise (Industrial Ex Im),
with IITPIC acting as technical advisor.
3.05      Local procurement was handled by the Enterprise itself.  Civil
works and construction work were executed by the Pitesti Industrial
Construction Trust, a specialized enterprise under the Ministry of
Industrial Construction. The works execution has been done under the
supervision of and using IITPIC's technical assistance and has been
coordinated by the Enterprise. Staff from the companies selected for
supplying the licenses and general engineering have participated closely
with Romanian counterparts in all aspects of detailed engineering,
training, equipment manufacturing, control and erection, and start-up of
the Project.
D. Employment and Training
3.06      The Enterprise currently employs 1,861 staff,-of which 1,688 are
workers (1,652 skilled) and 173 are management personnel, compared to a
total of 2,150 estimated during appraisal. Availability of labor was
ensured through the Enterprise's training program. Thirty technicians from
the Enterprise were given special training abroad by the license suppliers.
3.07      The total work force of the Enterprise is formed as follows:
(a)  421 constituting the core of staff and skilled labor required
were transferred from existing chemical and fiber plants in the
Central;
(b)  724 were trained in other existing factories in Romania;
(c)  680 were graduates from vocational schools;
(d)  36 were unskilled labor.

E. Use and Performance of Engineering Firms and Consultants
3.08      As previously mentioned, IITPIC and the Enterprise had overall
responsibility for design and supervision of execution of the Project.
During Project implementation, staff from licensors and engineering
suppliers provided the Enterprise, the general project designer and the
construction enterprise with technical assistance. Staff from Mitsubishi,
Toray and Cheitex (para. 3.11) should be particularly mentioned, as having
provided satisfactory technical assistance for equipment erection, testing
and training.
F. Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.09      Procurement took place under the general coordination of the
Enterprise with the responsibility for technical aspects being assumed by
IITPIC. Foreign procurement was done under the responsibility of Indus-
trial Ex Im. Goods and services required for the Project Lnd financed out
of the Loan proceeds were procured following the Bank's Procurement Guide-
lines. Out of the total Loan amount of US$50 million, contracts amounting
to US$48.2 million were awarded based on international competitive bidding
(ICB) and the remaining US$1.8 million were contracts for small items
awarded through limited international shopping, with 3 or 4 foreign compa-
nies participating in each tender. In spite of the large number (304) of
packages financed out of the Loan proceeds there were no procurement prob-
lems pointing to the good cooperation between the Bank, the Borrower, the
foreign suppliers and the Enterprise.
3.10      The main package project supplier - Mitsubishi Company (Japan),
together with Chemtex (US) and Toray (Japan), furnished and ensured the
Project's technology, licenses, engineering and main equipment and provided
the Project with technical assistance for the commissioning of the plant
and adequate guarantees for the equipment, in spite of the delay in commis-
sioning that extended beyond the contracted guarantee period.
3.11      In the Appraisal Report, it was anticipated that 46.7% of the
equipment and 90.8% of the licensing and engineering costs would be payable
in foreign exchange.   The actual cost of imported equipment and supplies
(US$30.5 million) and technology (US$7.9 million) amounted, respectively,
to 44% and 68% of the total for these categories. Romanian enterprise
supplied, through ICB, 23.22 of the Bank financed goods and services.
Among foreign suppliers, the most important ones were Japan, the Federal
Republic of Germany (FRG) and the US (Annex 3-1).
G. Implementation Schedule
3.12      Estimated and actual implementation schedules for the Project are
shown in Annex 3-2. Commissioning was scheduled for January 1980 at the
time of appraisal. Actual commissioning was spread out between June 1981
and December 1982. The Project's start-up has been assumed to have taken
place in March 1982, when the full capacity of polyester polymer making was
attained and the first and most of the second spinning lines were
mechanically completed.



-6-
3.13      The Project completion delay was 26 months.  The main reasons
were:
(a) design and engineering delays caused by differences between the
metric system used by Toray and Mitsubishi and the US standards
used by Chemtex and Romanian agencies;
(b)  repeated alterations made by the technology suppliers in the
technical documentation required to manufacture locally a part of
the equipment and technical installations;
(c)  delays in contracting some locally manufactured and foreign
equipment due to tardiness in finalizing the technical
documentation; and
(d) the fact that some local factories were manufacturing, for the
first time domestically, specialized equipment based on the
technical documentation provided by the licensor and technology
suppliers.
Given the high level of technology transfer achieved, the project
implementation schedule is, however, considered reasonable.
H. Ecology
3.14      The plant does not cause environmental problems since gas and
liquid effluent levels are kept low. Liquid effluents resulting from the
production process (i.e. organic substances, slurry, sulphates and
petroleum products) are treated in a biological and chemical treatment
plant before being discharged into the river. The cost of this plant is
included in the Project costs. The plant installations are also provided
with ventilation systems that maintain suspended particles within
internationally accepted standards.
I. Capital Cost, Financing and Loan Disbursement
3.15      Capital cost estimates at the time of appraisal and actual
figures are shown ir. Annex 3-3, summarized in the following table:

a/  Calculated at the official rates in force each year during construction
5/ Nominal interest paid by the Enterprise to the Investment Bank through

3.16      Total financing required for the Project expressed in US$
equivalent was slightly higher than the 1977 estimate due to delay in
commissioning but the actual project cost, at US$124.8 million, is 3.2%
lower than the appraisal estimate.
3.17      Because of revaluation of the Lei which took place on March 6,
1978 (from Lei 20 to Lei 18 to the US$) and on December 31, 1980 (from Lei
18 to Lei 15 to the US$), the Project cost expressed in Lei are
significantly different from those expressed in US$. Thus, total financing
required for the Project (excluding interest during construction) amounted
to Lei 2,316 million, a reduction of 14.9% when compared to the appraisal
estimate of Lei 2,722 million and the Project cost (Lei 2,104 million) is
18.4% lower than the estimate at the time of the appraisal (Lei 2,578
million).
3.18      In implementing the project, savings were registered in most cost
categories of expenditures: equipment, civil works, licenses & engineering,
technological tests.  This is mainly due to favorable price developments
and efficient implementation, that compensated for some additional costs
due to delays in commissioning the plant on time. The actual cost of
direct imports (US$38.4 million) was 3.6% lower than the 1977 estimate. As
has been found in other Bank-financed projects, there was a significant
(20.1X) underrun in the local currency cost of the Cimpulung Project. This
is mainly due to conservative cost estimates used in the techo-economic
studies and the good coordination in the project preparation by the several
agencies involved. In spite of the revaluation of the Lei mentioned above,
the cost of local expenditures expressed in USS has also decreased but by
only 4.7% from US$78.5 to US$74.8 million (Annex 3-3).



-8-
3.19      Annual capital cost expenditures are shown in Annex 3-4.
Initially, the closing date of the Bank Loan was March 31, 1981. As a
result of the delays in Project implementation (para 3.13), the Bank agreed
to a one-year extension of the closing date through March 31, 1982. The
actual schedule of Loan disbursements has therefore significantly departed
from that estimated at the time of appraisal. Compared to the appraisal
estimates (Annex 3-5), disbursements were as follows:

3.20      To meet the shortfall in some categories, especially for the
main package, proceeds of the Loan were reallocated on January 28, 1981,
and actual disbursements as compared to the appraisal estimates were as
follows:

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A. Production Build-up
4.01      Although the Project should have been fully completed by January
1980, the actual commissioning dates were the following
Project Commissioning Schedule
Polyester chips                                 June 1981
First line polyester fiber                     March 1982
Second line polyester fiber                     Aug. 1982
Third line polyester fiber                      Dec. 1982
As a result of the above, production has also lagged behind schedule,
having reached 40% capacity uti'lization in 19B2. Full capacity operation
is expected by 1984. (Actual and projected oztput of the Enterprise is
shown in Annex 4-1).
4.02      Most of the Projects' output will be sold to other Romanian
enterprises. Polyester chips will be sold to the Vaslui Polyester Enter-
prise to produce filament yarn. Polyester cotton-type staple and other
types of fiber are to be sold to spinning enterprises and further down-
stream to weaving mills and knitting mills under the same Ministry.
B. Market Development
4.03      Polyester production and consumption are coordinated at a central
level. Overall programs are approved by the Council of Ministers. The
attainment of the approved levels of production are the responsibility of
the Central, which establishes and issues annual quantitative shares for
each producer and consumer. Actual figures for the country's production
and consumption of synthetic fibers in 1980 - 1982 and present projections
for 1985 are shown below and compared with the figures planned in 1977, at
the time of appraisal.

- 10 -
The actual figures for 1980 are significantly (14.2Z) lower than originally
expected because of the commissioning delay; but 1985 production is
projected to be higher.
V. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.  Value of Sales and Production Costs
5.01      Present Romanian prices for the Project products and unit costs
of the main inputs are shown in Annex 5-1.  The average price of polyester
in 1982 was 41.8% higher than at the time of appraisal in 1977 and the cost
of the two main raw materials - DMT and EG - increased by 47.7% and 37.5%
respectively. The cost of fuel increased in the same period by 280% while
that of power increased by only 7%. Overall operating costs increased by
40.7%.
5.02      Unit consumption of the main raw materials has met the
specifications of the suppliers of technology and process equipment and
therefore departs little from the figures used at the time of appraisal.
Operating costs of full capacity are shown in Annex 5-2.
B. Financial Analysis
5.03      Financial results and projections are shown in Annex 5-3.  They
are based on actual volume and value of sales through the end of 19B2;
projections are based on the present prices applied to the forecast volume
of production and sales.
5.04      The internal financial rate of return calculated on the basis of
the above analysis is 5.6% (Annex 5-4), compared to 4.7% estimated at the
time of appraisal. The increase in product prices has more than
compensated for the higher unit cost of inputs and the delays in project
completion (para. 5.01).
VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
6.01      The international market for polyester is at present (September
1983) in an unbalanced situation, with export prices as low as US$0.52/lb
being offered by East Asian countries, while the prevailing prices in Japan
and the US are US$0.72-0.7311b. In Western Europe, polyester prices aver-
age US$0.67 and this price (less freight) has been assumed for years 1983
and 1984, since the Romanian synthetic fiber is geared for competition in
the European market. Because of the existing world-wide recession present
polyester prices are below cost plus a reasonable return on invested
funds. A balanced supply/demand market is expected to result in a price of
not less than US$0.80/lb by the late 1980s.



6.02      For the calculation of trie economic rate of return, polyester
prices have been assumed to build up from present levels to the equilibrium
value mentioned above over a period of four years. The prices for DMT and
EG have also been adjusted and those for electric power and fuel have been
changed from their 1982 domestic levels of Lei 415.8 (US$27.72) per MWh and
Lei (US$121.67) per ton to Lei 450 (US$30)/HWh and Lei 2,250 (US$150)/MT
respectively. The other costs have been maintained at the same level as
those used in the financial analysis.
6.03      The economic rate of return calculated on the basis of the above
is 14.2% (Annex 6-2) as compared to 15.6% estimated during appraisal. The
slightly lower return is due to the completion delay and the current
depressed economic price for polyester.
VII. BANK ROLE AND LESSONS LEARNED
A. Bank Role
7.01      During the mid-1970s, the project formed part of a broad-based
effort on the part of the Bank to assist Romania in improving the
performance of its industrial sector. Other projects selected include
those in the fertilizer, steel, chemicals, fibers, and mechanical
subsectors. This Project was selected bec3use it included the acquisition
of modern technology (introducing continuous polyester polymerization and
spinning) and was based on the substitution of imports of a key industrial
intermediate: polyester fiber for the textile and tire industries.
7.02      The Bank actively supported the Romanian agencies in defining the
main technology and equipment package and in the preparation for
competitive bidding for that package, including satisfactory performance
guarantees. The Bank also assisted the Enterprise in the procurement of
other equipment and supplies thus helping in lowering the total project
cost. The Project has included a substantial transfer of modern technology
developed by a consortium of three international firms, among the best
qualified in the field of polyester technology. This transfer was directed
not only to the Project itself but also, through the collaboration for the
supply of some specialized equipment domestically, to the machinery
building industries. Finally, the Bank assisted the Romanian agencies in
developing more realistic projections for textile fibers supply and demand
and determining priority for development of natural and man-made fiber
supply.
7.03      Overall, the Bank has helped the Romanian agencies to develop a
better understanding of economic criteria in project evaluation. This
Project is one example of this continuing process. Also, the Project
created nearly 2,000 new jobs and tapped a pool of women workers in a rural
area where male employment was predominant.



- 12 -
B. Lessons Learned
7.04      The experience gained in this Project confirms lessons learned in
previous Romanian projects. Project implementation was reasonably
successful despite a 26 month delay. Early supervision proved beneficial
in completing all arrangements for proper engineering and technology
acquisition, and in developing adequate procurement procedures. Guidance
provided to the project sponsor in the early stages was critical in this
instance, and led to a better understanding of the Bank's procedures and
thus to more efficient project implementation. This point has been
confirmed in a number of other projects in Romania.
7.05      A long time was required to negotiate the supply of the main
technology package with the international consortium mentioned above. The
purpose of the extended negotiations was to obtain a price consistent with
estimated costs, obtain maximum information on technology and to minimize
the foreign content of the package. Overall the transfer of technology
achieved in this project is deemed successful but at the cost of a delayed
start-up.

Dear ML-. Watanabe,
Re. Project Completion Report
Cimpulung muscel Polyester Project - Loan 1448 HO
We thank you for your letter of October 17, 1984, and
we inform you on our agreement on the attached draft of the
completion report, but we have the following views and coments
that we would like to be included in the final report and to
eliminate any unclearness from the present draft, as follow
i.  pDra 2.o3 of the draft is mentioning that n IB
Text      was commited to charge a nominal interest rate of lo % on the Loan
amended to  proceeds used in the Project ". This remark is not according to the
incorporate case, because the Investment Bank on-lented to the enterprise the
comments
Loan proceeds at the same interest rate as those of IBRD - 8.2 %.
This is why, we do propose a rewording of the respective phrase
as follow : IB on-lent the Loan proceeds to the enterprise at the
same interest rate as these applied by IBRD - 8.2 %.
Text                     ii.   pars 3.13 regarding the reasons for Project
amended to  completion delay, we do propose to be revew and to be presented
incorporate according to the situations generating them and as have been
comments
mentioned in the draft prepared by the Investment Bank, respectively:
(a) design and engineering delays caused by
differences between the metric system used by Toray and Mitsubishi
and the US standards used by Chemtex and Romanian agencies;
(b) repeated alterations done by the technology
suppliere in the technical documentation required to manufacture
locally a part of the equipment and technological installations;

(c) delays in contracting some locally manufactured
and foreign equipment, caused by delays in ensuring the technical
documentation;
(d) delays in the delivery of same local equipment
&            manufactured for the first time domesticaly, based on the
technical documentation supplied by the licence and engineering
supplier.
We do sustain the above mentioned taking account that,
most of the delays in contracting some locally manufactured and
foreign equipment and in the delivery of some locally ms;aufactured
equipment were caused by delays in design and engineering and
in contracting the supply of the main ter-unology packame.
iii.   para 3.18 is mzentioning tbket " Also, the
Text amended Romanian pricing system which includes low domestic inflation
to inicor-
porate      rates.." * Related to this, we would like to mention that the
couments    Romanian pricing system is characterized by the existence
of " stable prices " , that could not vary in function of the
changes in individual production and supply condition, ensuring,
in the same time, maintenance of the prices level in accordance
with the social expenditures, by changing the prices according
to the change. of the element took into consideration on the
ocasion of the establishement of the respective prices.
Accordingly, the draft wording does not correspond to
the Romanian pricing system and we do propose to be eliminate
from the report.
Text:                 iv.   pars 7.05 is mentioning that " Much of the
amended to  implementation delay was caused by the inexperience of Romanian firmi

technology.
This mention is making an unrealistic generalisation on
the lomanian firms activity.
Some dificulties encountered to this project due to
the fact that same equipment have been manufactured domesticaly
for the first time, these could not be considered as beeing
generaly and to be applied to the whole activity of Romanian
firms in supplying engineering services and equipment based on
a new technology, done and for other projects by the Romanian
firms. Because we do consider the respective mention as beeing

not according to the reality, we would like to be eliminated.
Otherwise, the reasons for the delay were  presaeted
in detail, in pare 3.13 of the draft.                                
With these views and comments, that we would like to
be included in the final report, we do agreed to the project
completion report submitted.
