CIMPULUNG-MUSCEL POLYESTER PROJECT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report deals with the appraisal of a project to construct a
new synthetic fiber plant with a capacity of 46,700 tons per year (TPY) of
polyester to be built at Cimpulung, in the judet (district) of Arges, Romania.
The plant is expected to begin commercial production in early 1980 and will
increase the country's present synthetic fiber capacity by 4Q%. The feed-
stocks will come from existing petrochemical plants and one now under con-
struction in the nearby cities of Ploiesti and Pitesti. The project will
be owned by the Government and is expected to require financing of about
US$136 million, including about US$56.4 million in total foreign exchange.
ii.       The plant will be operated by a new enterprise (the Cimpulung-
Muscel Synthetic Fiber Enterprise) which will be established as part of the
Industrial Central for Chemical Fibers and Yarn (the Central), an organiza-
tion under the Ministry of Chemical Industries, which also operates the ex-
isting synthetic fiber plants at Savinesti and Iasi. The plant is projected
to produce 10,500 TPY of cotton-type staple, 10,000 TPY of flax-type staple
and 11,000 TPY of wool-type tow and tops but is designed to permit flexibility
in the product-mix in line with actual demand. It will produce 15,200 TPY of
chips, which will be processed into textile and industrial filament in other
Romanian plants. The entire output is mainly destinated for the domestic
textile and clothing industries but, in the first four years of operation,
about one-fourth may be exported.
iii.      Romanian textile fiber production and consumption have grown very
rapidly--at average annual rates of 18.4% and 9.4% respectively in the last
ten years--but the net deficit of fibers has still been increasing and now
amounts to more than 100,000 TPY (virtually all due to imported cotton).
Production and consumption growth of synthetic fibers during the same period
has been even more impressive amounting to about 40% and 27% per year re-
spectively. From 1975 through 1985 fiber consumption is projected to grow at
a slower pace, with annual rates of 7.1% for all yarn and 12% for synthetics.
Production through 1980 is forecast to increase slightly faster than consump-
tion, so that the textile fiber deficit would drop to about 90,000 tons. If
no new plants were to be built after those now projected, substantial fiber
imports would be again required by 1985. However, the Government is expected
to initiate new synthetic projects in the early 80's with the objective of
maintaining an export position in synthetic fibers and thereby reducing the
net fiber deficit further.
iv.       The project will incorporate up-to-date technology and will be
implemented by the Central with the collaboration of the foreign supplier
of the main technology/equipment package as well as that of specialized
agencies in the Ministry of Chemical Industries: IITPIC, in charge of



- ii -
design and engineering of chemical industries, and ROMCHIM, the importing
agency for process equipment. The Central's technical staff, as well as
those of IITPIC and ROMCHIM, are known to the Bank and their performance
is considered satisfactory. The proposed site presents no difficult con-
struction problems and is well connected by road and rail to fabricators of
equipment (abroad and in Romania), the sources of feedstocks and markets.
No major difficulties are therefore foreseen in the implementation, start-
up and operation of the project.
v.        The project will be financed by State funds including the proposed
Bank loan of US$50 million which would be passed on to the project by the
Investment Bank (the Borrower). The Bank loan would cover about 37% of the
total financing including interest during construction and 89% of the direct
and indirect foreign exchange required by the project.
vi.       Disbursements of the Bank loan will be made against goods and
services procured following Bank guidelines. Licenses, technical knowhow,
engineering and key equipment will be procured as a single package (US$23.6
million). Appropriate advertising and prequalification procedures consis-
tent with Bank guidelines have been followed. International competitive
bidding (ICB) will also be used for the procurement of materials and other
equipment except that international shopping may be followed for process-
critical equipment - where only a limited number of suppliers exist - and
small procurement packages costing less than US$100,000 equivalent each.
The total cost of packages to be procured by international shopping is lim-
ited to US$1.8 million.
vii.      The financial situation of the Central, as well as proforma finan-
cial statements for both the Central and the new enterprise to be put in
charge of the project, are satisfactory. The economic rate of return has been
estimated at 15.6% and the project would save about US$30 million annually
in foreign exchange. Additionally, the project will link already existing
upstream petrochemical industries and downstream textile and clothing plants
and, through the local fabrication of equipment, help the further development
of the Romanian machine-building industry.
viii.     The synthetic fiber industry is already well established in Romania
as part of a competitive chemical industry. The potential risks are deemed
to be moderate. The economic prices for the project products and tradable
inputs are considered conservative. There is a possible risk associated to
the Romanian decision to build locally a substantial portion of the equipment
required. This risk, however, is minimized by the proposed participation
of an international licensing and engineering firm, well established in
polyester technology, which will provide adequate performance guarantees and
technical assistance in the local manufacture of equipment, project erection
and start-up operations.
ix.       On the basis of the agreements reached with the Government and
the Borrower, the project is suitable for a Bank loan of US$50 million
equivalent to the Investment Bank for a term of 15 years, including 3
years of grace, at 8.2% interest rate.



I. INTRODUCTlIN
1.01      The Government of Romania has requested Bank financing of US$50 mil-
lion equivalent for a polyester plant with a capacity of 31,500 tons per year
(TPY) of staple fiber 1/ and 15,200 TPY of polyester chips. The plant, to b(
located in the town of Cimpulung, Arges, about 130 km northwest of Bucharest
(Map IBRD 12628) will be operated by the Cimpulung-Muscel Synthetic Fiber
EiiLciirise (CIMPULUNG or the Enterprise) within the Industrial Central for
Chemical Fibers and Yarn (SAVINESTI or the Central), the coordinating agency
for all synthetic fiber plants organized under the Ministry of Chemical
Industry. At full capacity operation, the project will increase present
Romanian synthetic fiber capacity from 110,700 TPY to 157,400 TPY, or by 42%.
The pro;icct is part of the Government's strategy for the rapid development
of industry. Total financing required, including interest during construc-
tion, is estimated at about US$136 million equivalent, of which US$56.4 mil-
lion is in foreign exchange.
1.02      The Bank has extended three loans for industrial projects in Romania
for a total of US$168 million. 2/ The proposed loan will be the first for
a synthetic fiber project. It was selected for Bank consideration from a
group of ten projects in the chemical sector by an Identification Mission in
May 1976 and appraised in September/October by Messrs. A. Tarnawiecki (Chief)
D. E. Brown, J. F. Rischard, and A. Sandig, of the Industrial Projects Depart-
ment and Mr. Geerdes, a consultant in synthetic fibers.
II. THE SYNTHETIC FIBER INDUSTRY IN ROMANIA
A. Chemical Industry Background
2.01      The chemical industry has been one of Romania's most dynamic sec-
tors. Since 1950, it has attained an average growth of 21% a year, and
ranks now in third place, with a share of about 11% of total industrial
output, behind the machine building and metal working industries (31%) and
the food industries (13%). It absorbed about 15% of total industrial in-
vestment and employed 7% of the industrial labor force in 1975.

The development strategy for the chemical industry has been largely designed
so as to increase the value added to the country's petroleum and methane
gas resources. Accordingly, the fastest growth has occurred in fertilizers,
plastics, and synthetic rubber and fibers. Long-term plans continue to attrib-
ute a high priority to petrochemicals, which are expected to account for
three-fourths of the chemical industry output by 1990, against about one
half today.
2.02      The industry is largely concentrated in the center and the south
of the country, where large refinery and petrochemical complexes have been
developed around Ploiesti and Pitesti to produce a broad range of refinery
products, petrochemical intermediates and end-products. The Government is
making an effort to locate downstream industries, such as fertilizers or
synthetics, away from these traditional industrial centers, partly to promote
a more balanced regional development, thus also avoiding industrial conges-
tion, and partly because of greater availability of labor and accommodations.



B. History and Organization of the Synthetic Fiber Industry 1/
2.03      The synthetic fiber industry started only in 1960 2/ but produc-
tion, initially of nylon and later of other fibers, increased rapidly as
shown below.

Polyolefins                    -        -         -       0.3    n.a.
Total Synthetics              0.9      3.3      29.5     95.6
Cellulosics                  3.2      17.7      47.1     63.0
Total Man-made                4.1     21.0      76.6    158.6
Quality of output has generally been satisfactory.  Capacity utilization
reached 86% in 1975 which is high considering that a 41,300 TPY polyester
plant became fully operative only in 1974. In 1970 all the plants then
installed were operating above capacity.
2.04      In 1948, industrial enterprises were nationalized and, in the
following years, many small enterprises were merged into larger ones. In
1969, units in the same branch of the chemical industry (petrochemicals,
fertilizers, inorganic chemicals, rubber and plastic products and synthetic
fibers) were grouped into industrial centrals and a three-tier organiza-
tional structure emerged: the "enterprise" at the lowest rung, the Ministry
of Chemical Industries at the top (other than national bodies such as the
Grand National Assembly, the Supreme Council of Economic and Social Develop-
ment and the Council of Ministers), and the centrals as middle-level produc-
tion agencies (Annex 2-1).
2.05      The Ministry of Chemical Industries is in charge of all national
activities in the sub-sector and in particular of: (i) translating the
national economic objectives into production targets for the sub-sector;
1/   See also Bank Report No. 492-RO "Planning and the Planning System in
Romania, dated October 11, 1974.
2/   Production of man-made fibers, however, began much earlier, in the
mid-30's, with two small rayon plants (total capacity 300 TPY) in
Bucharest and Lupeni.



- 4 -
(ii) preparing the projects which are required to meet these targets; 1/
(iii) ensuring that the production and financial results of individual chem-
ical industrlos conform to the Five-Year and Annual Plans; and (iv) co-ordinat-
ing the sub-sector's activities with those of other industrial sub-sectors and
other sectors of the economy. Also under the Ministry of Chemical Industries
are the following agencies: The Technological Engineering and Design Insti-
tute for Chemical Industry (IITPIC), the Import Agency for Chemical Equipment
and Technology (ROMCHIM), and Danubiana, the agency for the exportation of
many chemical products, including synthetic fibers.
C. The Central and the Enterprise
2.06      The Industrial Central for Chemical Fibers and Yarn (SAVINESTI
or the Central) is, within the Ministry's directives, responsible for the
production and distribution of synthetic fibers. This Central comprises
the nylon and acrylics plant at Savinesti and the polyester plant at Iasi
and will have under its jurisdiction the proposed Cimpulung plant (para.
4.09) and the planned Vaslui (polyester filament) and Roman (nylon) plants
(Annex 2-1). The organization chart for SAVINESTI is shown in Annex 2-2.
In this, as in most other industrial centrals, there are five functional
departments (production, technological, commercial, finances and person-
nel). The Central's senior staff generally also act in similar functions in
one of the enterprises and the Central provides technical assistance to all
its enterprises.
2.07      A new enterprise, the Cimpulung-Muscel Synthetic Fiber Enterprise
(the Enterprise), will be formed by June 30, 1977. Establishment of the
Enterprise will be a condition of effectiveness of the Bank loan. A pro-
forma organization chart for the Enterprise, when it is formed, is shown
in Annex 2-3. Decision making power at the limited level of the enterprise
will formally belong to the Enterprise's General Assembly including all the
workers and meeting normally twice annually. A Working People's Executive
Committee, chaired by the Enterprise's General Manager and consisting of
elected workers' representatives and some members of the management, is to
be in charge of operations. The General and Technical Managers of the
Enterprise have already been appointed by SAVINESTI and will be responsible
for implementing the decisions of the Executive Committee. This type of
organization has worked satisfactorily in the day-to-day operations of other
chemical plants known to the Bank.
D. Financial Situation and Prospects of the Central
2.08      The Central is the locus for consolidation of the financial results
of the individual enterprises, the over-all surplus or deficit of the Centrals

the St    Budget.  As mentioned in previous Bank Appraisal Reports on Romania,
financial analyses and projections as generally applied by the Bank to evalu-
ate the performance and prospects of industrial enterprises are of limited
value in the Romanian system. However, to illustrate the scope of operations
under present price and cost relationships, actual and projected financial
statements for SAVINESTI are shown in Annex 2-4 and summarized below.

E. The Romanian Financial System
2.09      The State determines all prices and annual financial plans are made
by the enterprises and the industrial centrals so as to meet targets contained
in the Five-Year and Annual Plans. Since the primary responsibility of an en-
terprise is to meet established physical targets, and inputs and outputs are
calculated at fixed prices, financial profitability for an enterprise - as re-
lated to capital employed and output - is established by the central and the
efficiency of an enterprise's management is measured by the achievement of the
assigned production and profitability targets. There has been a historical



- 6 -
tendency for prices to remain stable over long periods of time (para 6.01).
This implies not only that there is a lack of close correlation with shift-
ing supply and demand relations but also that relationships between costs
and prices become distorted as industry expands and technology and produc-
tivity improve. To remedy these distortions, periodic price resettings
are undertaken for the whole economy, each sector being reviewed separately.
The last such price resetting (since 1963) was during 1974-76 and the pres-
ent internal prices for chemicals - which are now roughly in line with in-
ternational prices - are expected to be in force at least through the end of
the current Five-Year Plan period (1980).
2.10      The Investment Bank (the Borrower) administers and controls all
investment funds of the State Budget (except for agriculture and food pro-
cessing) and acts as the channel for all sources of major domestic investment
financing in industry. Recently, the Investment Bank has also started to
make credits on its own, though funds available for this purpose are still
relatively small. The President of the Investment Bank reports directly to
the Minister of Finance who has comprehensive authority in the planning and
financing of all projects. The Investment Bank has wide-ranging responsi-
bilities in the implementation of projects reviewing the Techno-Economic
Studies before their submission to the Council of Ministers for formal
approval and controlling the flow of funds during project execution. The
Investment Bank has no legal authority to bring its views to bear directly
on the management of an enterprise, but it can recommend necessary opera-
tional actions to the Ministry of Finance, which, in turn, can act through
the Ministry concerned with the project.
III. MARKET AND MARKETING
A. Introduction
3.01      The project's output will be predominantly for use in Romania.
However, since this is the first project directly financed by the Bank in
the synthetic fiber industry, and because of the need to look at the project
from the perspective of worldwide trends, background information on textile
fibers and their uses is given in Annex 3-1 and a detailed analysis of the
world fiber market, in Annex 3-2.                                              -
B. Background on World Textile Fiber Consumption
3.02      World consumption of textile fibers has expanded by an average 3.9%
a year during 1964-75. This trend has not been uniform over time, with con-
sumption growing at 0.6% a year between 1964 and 1967, then at the much faster
rate of 5.8% a year through the boom year of 1973; in 1974 consumption stagnated
and in 1975 dropped dramatically by 10% due to a combination of the downturn
in the textile cycle with the general economic recession which began in 1974.
Latest indications are that fiber consumption has recovered from its lowest
point in 1975 but has not yet regained its 1973 level.

3.03      The structure of world fiber consumption has kept changing, with
the share of natural fibers decreasing following the introduction of various
man-made fibers. 1/ This trend accelerated during the last decade as new
synthetics--acrylics and especially polyester fibers--started to make signifi-
cant inroads into the markets held by natural and even other man-made (e.g.,
rayon) fibers. As the following table shows, the share of synthetics thus
grew from less than 10% in 1964 to more than 31% in 1975 and among synthetics,
polyester, which represented less than 2% of consumption in 1964, accounted
for more than 14% in 1975, with an average annual growth rate of 26% over the
decade.

for silk (hence the name of artificial silk for rayon) and later for
cotton; the first true synthetic fiber--nylon--was made during World War
II. Polyester and acrylic were marketed in significant amounts only
after 1960.

3.04      Home consumption 1/ of textile fibers in the centrally planned
economies (CPEs) and developing countries (LDCs) has grown faster than in
the developed countries largely due to the high level of per capita con-
sumption (16.6 kg in 1974) already reached in industrialized countries
compared to the more modest averages for LDCs (3.1 kg) and CPEs (6.2 kg).
Among the latter, the USSR and Eastern Europe have traditionally enjoyed a
relatively high per capita consumption (13.7 kg). The pattern of mill con-
sumption in various regions and groups of countries differs substantially,
with natural fibers accounting in recent years for about three quarters of
total mill consumption in CPEs and LDCs while in developed countries the
proportion has been reduced to an average 37%. The share of synthetics
approaches 50% in developed countries but is still as low as 17% in LDCs
and 14% in CPEs, despite the rapid growth rates for synthetic fibers in
these countries.
3.05      Inter-fiber competition has largely centered around quality and
performance considerations, price competitiveness, product development and
promotion, and the ability of producers to assure a consistent supply at
relatively stable prices. Man-made fibers, and especially polyester, have
many of the properties possessed by natural fibers in addition to other
desirable properties. Because of their strength and durability, abrasion
resistance, low shrinkage, quick drying, and easy care characteristics,
polyester staple fibers are particularly suitable for blending with humidity-
absorbing natural fibers (cotton, wool and flax).
3.06      Inter-fiber competition has also been strongly influenced by move-
ments in the relative prices of the main fibers. While rising costs of raw
materials and pollution legislation have led to sharp increases in the price
of cellulosics, polyester staple has steadily improved its price competitive-
ness with regard to natural fibers, and in particular cotton.

The price of polyester in the US, which in 1960 was more than three times
the average price of cotton, had fallen below cotton by 1972, contributing
in a major way to the spectacular growth rates of polyester fiber consumption.
Although polyester lost part of its price advantage during 1975, it fully
regained it during 1976, when cotton prices rose to unprecedented levels due
to a combination of the revival of total fiber demand along with a smaller
cotton crop in the preceding season.
C. Fiber Demand Projections and Prospects for Polyester Fibers
3.07       Based on per capita income elasticities for fiber consumption ob-
tained through cross-sectional analysis and Bank projections for population
and income growth (Annex 3-2, paras. 15-16), total fiber demand is projected
to grow over the next decade by 3.9% a year for the world as a whole (4.2%
in CPEs). To assess the outlook for polyester fiber demand, demand distri-
bution among the various fibers has also been analyzed (Annex 3-2, paras
17-23). This analysis has been based on data for developed countries,
which produce about three quarters of the world's synthetic fiber output,
and for which information on future inter-fiber competition fi ctors is more
readily available than for the rest of the world. The prospective growth in
total demand for polyester staple - 6.2% per year - thus found is very con-
servative since the rates in LDCs and CPEs, starting from lower bases, have
been historically, and are expected to continue to be, higher than for the
developed countries.
3.08       The prospects for polyester staple over the next decade
are favorable taking into account that this versatile and high performance
fiber (para. 3.05) is likely to continue to substitute for other fibers in a
variety of apparel and non-apparel uses. In particular, polyester staple is
expected to keep a significant cost advantage over cotton, since its projected
long-term price (in 1976 US$), estimated at 75i per lb. (para. 3.09), com-
pares favorably with the long-term cotton price of 65g per lb. 1/ The
projected growth rate for total demand for polyester staple of 6% a year is
conservative compared with past experience 2/ and relative to the projected
growth of other synthetic and natural fibers. Polyester filament, on the
contrary, is not expected to grow beyond its present per capita consumption
level in Developed Countries (Annex 3-2, para 21).
1/   This is partly due to the lower weight required for polyester fabrics for
the same end-use and partly to durability and easy-care properties which
allowed polyester to displace part of the cotton demand even when poly-
ester prices were much higher than those for cotton. Further increases
in oil prices are not likely to change fundamentally these long-term
price relationships. (Cotton requires inputs - such as fertilizers,
insecticides, tractor fuel and power for ginning - which are also sensi
tive to hydrocarbon prices.)
2/   The average annual growth rate of world polyester consumption was
26% during the period 1964-75 (para 3.03).



- 10 -
D. Price Forecast for Polyester Fibers
3.09      With the 1974/75 downturn in fiber consumption, combined polyester
staple and filament production capacity utilization fell to a world average
of 77% in 1975, still above the even lower levels of capacity utilization
prevalent in that year for acrylics and nylon. Since mid-1976, however,
polyester staple capacity utilization has reached about 85% in the US and
75-80% in Western Europe, where textile demand still shows only weak signs
of recovery. Furthermore, as a result of large capacity additions in fila-
ment plants in anticipation of a strong demand build-up for knitted polyester
filament fabrics which did not materalize, capacity utilization in filament
plants is now only 50-60%. Because of these conditions, present polyester
staple and filament prices have either resulted in losses or do not yield
adequate returns to industry. Under balanced supply and demand conditions,
a long-term price of US754 per pound of polyester staple (in constant 1976
dollars) has been projected and is considered conservative by industry sources
as well as by the Bank's Commodities Division.
3.10      On the basis of the - probably conservative - 6% annual growth
projected for polyester staple demand in developed countries and planned
capacity additions until 1980, 1/ polyester staple demand might be expected
to catch up with capacity by about 1983. Concurrently, staple prices are
expected to increase gradually to the above-mentioned equilibrium price of
751 per pound (expressed in 1976 dollars).
E. Fiber Production and Consumption in Romania
3.11      The Romanian textile fiber production grew at an average annual rate
of 18.4% during 1965-75 (Annex 3-3) and met 65% of the country's mill consump-
tion needs in 1975, as against only 30% in 1965. As in other countries, this
growth has been especially pronounced in man-made fibers.

Despite a rate of growth in fiber production nearly double as high as in
consumption (9.4%), the country's over-all fiber deficit in 1975 was still
about 18% above that ten years earlier. However, Romania has begun to
finance part of its growing imports of natural fibers (mainly cotton) through
a small net export surplus in synthetics; these exports represented about 2%
of total synthetic fiber imports by developed countries in 1975.
3.12      During 1965-75, the annual growth rates in mill consumption of
natural and cellulosic fibers in Romania have averaged 4.5% and 9.6%, respec-
tively. By contrast, synthetic fiber consumption increased by 27.4% a year
in the same period. While the structure of mill consumption has thus changed
along with that of other countries, it still remains significantly different
from average proportions observed in developed countries as shown below:

In spite of the rapid growth in Romania's consumption of synthetic fibers,
their share remains well below that in developed countries, indicating
a significant potential for further substitution of other fibers -- mainly
cotton and cellulosics.
F. The Outlook for Textile Fiber Production and Consumption in Romania
3.13      Based on 1976-80 Five-Year Plan data and discussions with the
Investment Bank, projections of fiber production and mill consumption through
1980 have been prepared reflecting predictable project slippages and a likely
revision of plans for production of cellulosics. Production projections for
1985 only take into account the output from existing plants and known proj-
ects since no projects beyond the early 1980's could be identified pending
elaboration of the next Five-Year Plan. The 1985 consumption projections
were derived from aggregate long-term planning indicators. These projec-
tions are summarized in the following table:

According to the above table, total fiber consumption is projected to grow
between 1975 and 1985 at an average of 7.1% per year, i.e. at a slower pace
than during the preceding decade (9.4%). Consumption of natural and cellu-
losic fibers, forecast to increase at average annual rates of 5.3% and 4.3%
respectively during the same period (1975-85), will continue to lose ground
to synthetic fibers. The synthetics growth of 12% per year does not match
the steep upswing in consumption which took place in the preceding decade and
the projected share of synthetic fibers in Romanian mill consumption (40% in
1985) would still lag behind that already reached in the developed countries
(47.7% in 1974).
3.14      Production growth is projected to average 13.2% annually through
1980, i.e. faster than mill consumption, thus causing a drop in the net
fiber deficit from 104,800 to 92,000 tons between 1975 and 1980. If in fact
no new projects were started beyond 1980, the country's deficit in fiber
supplies could reach some 163,000 tons and in particular a projected synthetic
fiber surplus of 24,000 tons in 1980 would become a deficit of 50,000 tons by
1985. It is expected, however, that new projects will be included in the next
Five-Year Plan practically closing the gap between synthetic fiber consumption
and production and reducing imports to cotton only.
3.15      A further breakdown of polyester production and consumption projec-
tions into staple and filament is discussed in Annex 3-3. The projections
for staple, the project's main output, are summarized below:

/a   Includes existing production capacity plus 1,000 tons of additional staple
capacity from expansion of Iasi plant.
Direct staple exports from CIMPULUNG are expected to be temporarily available,
mainly as wool-type staple or tops, in quantities closely coinciding with
those shown in the preceding table, and in any year amounting to less than 30%
of the plant's output. Cotton-type staple will go into clothing and other
textile products; it is estimated that between one-third and one-half of
CIMPULUNG's production will be in cotton-type staple and that, of this pro-
duction, about one-half (i.e. up to 7,500 TPY) is likely to be included in
the planned increase in Romanian exports of these traditional textile and
clothing products. 1/ Some flax-type blends might also be exported in small
quantities. Polyester filament produced elsewhere in Romania from CIMPULUNG's
output of chips would make only marginal quantities of textiles and clothing
available for exports.
1/   Were the Cimpulung project not to materialize, the Romanian clothing
industry would probably substitute the project's output with imported
fibers as it has done in the past and thus maintain about the same
export volume of garments. Such conversion is done in other countries
such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea.

G. Marketing Arrangements for the Project
3.16      Marketing arrangements for the Project are discusf-ed in Annex 3-4
and summarized here. The Enterprise's polyester staple, tow and tops in-
tended for use in Romania will be sold to the spinning enterprises under
different centrals in the Ministry of Light Industries. The spun yarn man-
ufactured by these enterprises will in turn be sold to weaving mills under
the same centrals and to the knitting mills of the Central for Knitting
Industry, also under the Ministry of Light Industries. Past experience with
regard to consumer acceptance of polyesror-blended textile goods in Romania
has been good. Since a large proportion of Romanian women are employed, the
easy-care characteristics of polyester blends are greatly appreciated, espe-
cially when costs relative to pure cotton or flax products are taken into
account. The variety and quality of the polyester-based blended fabrics
available in Romania for local consumption is good and some products have
stood the test of demanding export markets (e.g. F.R. of Germany, the U.K.
and Canada). Romania also intends to develop the use of polyester/flax
blended fabrics in view of the considerable importance of flax grown in
Romania and in other East European countries. Such blends combine the ex-
cellent characteristics of the relatively expensive flax fiber with the
lower density and finer appearance of cheaper polyester staple, and they
may also help Romania to substitute for some of the country's cotton re-
quirements (Annex 3-4), most of which are imported for convertible currency.
3.17      Consumer feedback plays an important role in the textile and cloth-
ing market in Romania and is taken into account in designing the product mix
of projects, such as Cimpulung, as well as in adjusting to short-term changes
in demand patterns. Consumer reactions are studied continuously by the
Ministry of Internal Trade using such means as: (i) statistical monitor-
ing based on turnover and inventory data collected from the retail channels;
(ii) customer interviews particularly regarding color emphasis and style;
and (iii) marketing studies performed by specialized research institutes.
3.18      The Enterprise will sell the small amounts of polyester staple
temporarily available for exports to Danubiana, the foreign trade enterprise
responsible, under the Ministry of Chemical Industry, for the marketing of
synthetic fibers abroad. Danubiana has extensive export experience in Eastern
and Western Europe and Canada, and has begun operations in the US and the
Middle-East. At present, prices quoted by Danubiana are generally about 5%
below those for unbranded fiber. This differential is considered normal for
a supplier establishing relationships with new customers and lacking the ex-
tensive technical services available from multi-national corporations.
3.19      Finally, the polyester chips to be produced by the Enterprise will
be sold to the future Vaslui plant which will in turn sell most of its out-
put (apparel-type filament yarn) to the knitting mills under the Ministry
of Light Industries and the remainder (industrial filament yarn) to indus-
trial users under various ministries (Annex 2-1).

IV. THE PROJECT
A. Project Scope
4.01      The project, comprising several polymerization, spinning and draw-
ing lines, is designed to produce a total of about 46,700 TPY of polyester.
One line is to produce 15,200 TPY of polyester chips -- which will be further
processed elsewhere in Romania (para 3.19) - while the other lines will have
the capacity to process 31,500 TPY of polymer into cotton, wool and flax-type
polyester fibers. This configuration assures maximum flexibility to match
production to actual demand. In addition, facilities will be provided to
convert 5,200 TPY of wool-type tow to tops. A flowsheet for the project is
shown in Annex 4-1. Infrastructure and related facilities include steam and
power generation, raw material and product transportation, handling and stor-
age, recovery and recycling of raw materials and by-product methyl alcohol,
as well as extensive maintenance and laboratory facilities.
4.02      The project will be located at Cimpulung (30,000 population), in
the judet (district) of Arges, at a distance by road of about 50 km north of
Pitesti and 160 km northwest of Ploiesti, the two major petrochemical centers
in Romania, which will supply feedstocks to the project. The selected site is
well-suited and presents no serious construction problems. It is connected by
rail and road to the feedstock sources and the project's major markets.
B. Raw Materials and Utilities
4.03      Raw materials required are ethylene glycol (EG) from an existing
factory in Pitesti and dimethyl-terephtalate (DMT) from a factory currently
under construction in Ploiesti. Manufacture of these feedstocks (based
largely on its domestic petroleum supply) is well established in Romania and
supply of raw materials is adequately balanced with needs. The slight cost
differential due to feedstock transportation costs is compensated by the
advantages of avoiding industrial congestion and the other benefits mentioned
in para. 2.02.
4.04      Power (about 12 MW) is to be supplied from the national grid (4MW)
and a captive power plant (8MW), in which steam for power generation and
process uses will also be generated using fuel oil as fuel. Water is to be
supplied from the nearby Tirgu river. The supply of required utilities
is therefore satisfactory.
C. Ecology
4.05      The general effluent levels permitted are shown in Annex 4-2.  These
levels are somewhat higher than in the US or Western Europe, but for tourist
areas or near larger cities stricter standards are applied on a case-by-case
basis. The project sponsors stated that internationally accepted effluent
standards will be employed since the site is in a tourist area and the Tirgu



- 16 -
River is upstream of major cities, and that the Project facilities will be
operated witn dtie regard to ecological, environmental and safety aspects.
D. Technology, Employment and Training
4.06      There is one existing polyester plant in Romania employing a batch
polymerization process. The Cimpulung project will be based on a modern,
continuous process (Annex 4-3) that will lower production costs and ensure
uniform product quality thus representing a significant technology transfer.
In addition, the project sponsors intend to build a substantial portion of the
equipment in Romania and bids are being solicited on this basis (para 4.11).
This approach will increase experience and know-how in fiber (and equipment)
technology for subsequent projects. About US$10 million equivalent, of the
main package represents costs of technology including license fees, engineer-
ing, and technical assistance to produce certain specialized equipment.
4.07      The project will provide about 2,150 new jobs, of which about
half are skilled or management personnel 1/. The core of staff and skilled
labor will be supplied by the Central from existing chemical and fiber plants.
Employment around Cimpulung and in the industrial city of Pitesti is predomi-
nantly male and therefore the project will be able to tap a pool of female
labor which is underutilized at present. The agricultural areas surrounding
Cimpulung can also provide the additional unskilled labor required by the
project. Therefore, given the Romanian emphasis on industrial decentraliza-
tion to foster regional development and employment and the relatively limited
mobility of the labor force in Romania, adequate staffing of the Enterprise
will be assured.
4.08      The chemical industry in Romania has a well-developed training
program that would also be used in this project. Key staff plus new graduates
will be transferred from existing plants or hired during the early part of
project implementation. Adequate training will be given in other existing fac-
tories in Romania and, where needed, outside Romania (or foreign specialists
brought in). Operators and semi-skilled labor will be hired later, and given
training in other factories prior to commissioning.
E. Project Implementation
4.09      The project will be owned by the State and implemented under the
project management of the CIMPULUNG Enterprise scheduled to be established
within the SAVINESTI Central after approval by the Council of Ministers of
the Techno-Economic Study. The project management team will include staff
1/   The proposed staffing is high compared to employment in similar plants
in developed countries. Labor costs, however, account for only a minor
portion of production costs.



- 17 -
from SAVINESTI, IITPIC and ROMCHIM who are experienced in the design,
engineering and operation of synthetic fiber projects. The Enterprise's
project manager will serve as overall project coordinator plus site con-
struction manager and is thus responsible for project completion. However,
several areas of project execution are delegated to other organizations not
under his control and the Ministry of Chemical Industry together with the
Investment Bank oversee the coordination of activities. Although this pro-
cedure appears somewhat cumbersome, it is well-established in Romania and
has worked satisfactorily in other projects.
4.10      IITPIC, the engineering and design institute under the Ministry of
Chemical Industry, is responsible for the general design of the project,
technical selection of any foreign technology and/or equipment to be used,
over-all site layout, construction design and detailed engineering. Civil
works and construction work, under the supervision and technical assistance of
IITPIC will be executed by another Government enterprise under the Ministry of
Buildings. ROMCHIM 1/, which reports to both the Ministry of Chemical Indus-
try and the Ministry of Foreign Trade, is responsible for all foreign procure-
ment, using IITPIC as technical advisor. Local procurement will be handled by
the Enterprise's project manager. Staff from the company(ies) to be selected
for supplying the licenses and general engineering for polymerization, spin-
ning and fiber processing (para 5.07) will participate closely with their
Romanian counterparts in all aspects of engineering, training, equipment
fabrication, erection and start-up of the project.
4.11      Generally in the synthetic fiber industry most of the equipment
would be supplied directly by the licensing/contracting firm or by firms
selected by them. IITPIC and ROMCHIM plan to maximize use of Romanian equip-
ment in the project and have requested, as noted above, that bidders for the
main technology/equipment package provide technical assistance as required to
manufacture a substantial part of the equipment locally. J.This equipment will
not be financed by the Bank.) The Bank will require that adequate guarantees
are extended by the suppliers of the main technology/equipment package to
ensure the technical reliability of the project, and Bank approval of the
contract for this main procurement package is a condition of effectiveness
of the Bank loan.
1/   ROMCHIM and IPROCHIM (the Process Design and Engineering Institute for
Chemical Industry which has now been merged with other Ministry of
Chemical Industry's agencies to form IITPIC) have been involved in the
Bacau Fertilizer Project and relations of the Bank with both organiza-
tions have improved with time and are satisfactorily conducted at a
high professional level.



- 18 -
4.12      The contract for the main technology/equipment package is expected
to be signed in June. Completion of the project is projected for January
1980 with 60% of the plant's capacity being achieved that year and full
capacity production in 1982 (Annex 4-4). This schedule is considered realis-
tic. The Borrower has agreed to maintain records on the progress of the
project and submit timely reports to the Bank on procurement actions and
progress of the project's implementation.
V. CAPITAL COST AND FINANCING PLAN
A. Project Costs
5.01      Total financing required for the project - including US$7.2 million
in interest and financial charges during construction - is estimated at
US$136.1 million, including US$56.4 million in foreign exchange as detailed
in Annex 5-1 and summarized below:

- 19 -
5.02      The estimates, prepared by IITPIC and SAVINESTI in September/
November 1976 and revised in May, are based on prices from the potential
process contractors for the imported engineering and key equipment (para
5.07).   Areas of building and cost estimates for some civil works were
revised by IITPIC following comments made by the Bank. Physical contingencies
have been assumed at 6% of the base cost estimate for licenses, engineering
and training, 8% for imported equipment and 12% for civil works and other
local currency costs. Price escalation has been calculated on the basis of 1%
annual increase for local costs and 7.5% annually during project implemen-
tation for foreign exchange costs, except for licenses, engineering and
equipment included in the main package, which are mostly fixed, and for
which total price escalation has been limited to 5%.
B. Working Capital
5.03      Incremental working capital is estimated at Lei 140 million reflect-
ing mainly inventories and not including spares, which are separately provided
for (Annex 5-2). Working capital will be relatively small (5.4% of the proj-
ect's cost estimate) since raw materials are to be received from nearby pro-
ducers on the basis of long-term contracts (para 4.03) and most of the output
will be sold on the same basis to textile mills in Romania.
C. Financing Plan
5.04      The financing requirements of the project are proposed to be covered
as follows:
CIMPULUNG - Proposed Financing Plan
(millions)
In                   In US Dollars
Lei               Equivalent         %

construction                       144                  7.2            5.3
Sub-total                      1,722                 86.1           63.3
Total Financing                      2                  136.1          100.0
5.05      The Council of Ministers' approval of a project automatically
includes the provision of funds required for it in the Romanian Budget.
Although the financing plan shown above is only a preliminary statement
prior to approval of the Techno-Economic Study, which contains the project's
technical and economic indicators, no change in the financing plan is expected.
The approval of these indicators by the Government will be a condition of
effectiveness of the Bank loan. Further, as mentioned, the Romanian system
has no simple mechanism for providing additional funds once this approval is
given, since the Council of Ministers' decision is law and another decision of



- 20 -
the Council would be required to authorize additional funds. Agreement has
also been reached on the project scope and the lists of goods to be procured,
including those which will be imported and that funds will be provided as
needed for carrying out the project, including prompt allocation of state
funds to cover any cost overrun.
5.06      The Bank loan is proposed to be extended to the Investment Bank
for 15 years, including 3 years of grace, at 8.2% interest rate. As in the
case of other Bank projects in Romania, the Investment Bank would pass on the
loan proceeds to the Enterprise together withi the State funds. There is no
formal on-lending operation from the Investment Bank to the Enterprise but
agreements have been received that all actions needed will be taken to ensure
that annual remittances of depreciation funds and benefits by the Enterprise
to the Investment Bank will be sufficient to cover (notional) payments of
interest and principal on the Bank loan on terms assumed to be identical to
those due to the Bank, except for an interest rate of 10%.
D. Procurement
5.07      The major package proposed for Bank financing comprises imported
technology, engineering, and key equipment and also includes drawings,
specifications and foreign technical assistance for items of equipment to be
made by Romanian fabricators. This complex package, costing an estimated
US$23.6 million and including physical and price contingencies, will be
procured through international competitive bidding. ROMCHIM had investigated
worldwide sources of technology between 1974 and 1976, and, at the Bank's
request, sent a notification to all embassies of Bank member countries and
Switzerland in Bucharest on November 20, 1976, advertising the request for a
specialized technology and equipment package. From 12 firms or groups of
firms considered, three were found to be qualified and interested in supplying
this complex package. Preliminary offers had previously been obtained from
these three firms in mid-1976 and extensive technical discussions followed
through January 1977, in which, among other issues, quality of products,
performance guarantees and technical specifications and, in this context, the
degree of acceptance of Romanian equipment, were discussed. Price bids were
submitted separately at the end of December and were opened on January 27,
1977. It is expected that, following evaluation of the proposals a contract
for this package will be signed by the end of June 1977. This procedure has
proven most effective for the procurement of a complex package such as that
required for the project.
5.08      Other equipment and materials estimated to cost about US$24.6
million will also be procured following international competitive bidding.
Romanian suppliers participating in international competitive bidding will
be accorded a margin of preference of 15% or the applicable customs duty,
whichever is lower, and it is expected that Romanian suppliers would win
about US$10.2 million of contracts for power plant, recovery systems for
raw materials and by-products, and some other miscellaneous equipment.
Imported items available from only a limited number of suppliers or cost-
ing less than US$100,000 each (and up to a total of US$1.8 million) may
be purchased through international shopping on the basis of suitability,
availability and price considerations, subject to prior approval by the
Bank of the list of items involved.

5.10      Changes in the lists of goods will be made only by previous agreement
between the Bank and the Borrower. Estimated quarterly disbursements for the
Bank loan are given in Annex 5-3.
VI. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Revenue and Operating Cost Estimates
6.01      The financial analysis of the project is based on a projection of
costs and revenues extending from the expected start-up of commercial opera-
tions in January 1980 through 1994. The project's production profile and the
prices for products and main inputs are contained in Annex 6-1. The averages
per kg of polyester fiber, DMT and EG are respectively Lei 23.57, 8.80 and
8.00 (US$1.18, 0.44 and 0.40). It is possible that during the life of the
project flax-type staple, which has the highest unit price of the project's
products, may not be maintained at the projected level of 10,000 TPY. The
price difference between cotton and flax-type staple is, however, less than
3% and therefore possible variations in the product mix over time would not
affect significantly the proforma financial results shown below. Prices for
all inputs and outputs are administered by the Government and have remained
constant for long periods of time (prices were not changed between 1963 and
1974). Most prices have been reset between 1974 and 1976 and no further
significant changes are being considered at this time. In any case, whatever
adjustments in input and output prices may be made, they are not expected to
affect the project's financial viability adversely in view of the Government's
policy to provide for a reasonable margin after covering the average produc-
tion costs, including depreciation.

/a   For this calculation, the IBRD loan to the Investment Bank has been
assumed to be the Enterprise's "debt" in spite of lack of formal on-
lending (para 5.06).
The projections are based on a normal production build-up (60% capacity
utilization in the first full year of operation, 80% in the second year
followed by 100% capacity utilization thereafter). This build-up is con-
sidered conservative since this type of plant can normally operate above
"rated" capacity.  Based on present prices, benefits - which can be considered
the equivalent of profits before taxes and interest - are expected to reach
13% of revenues in 1982 and thereafter.



- 23 -
C. Financial Return and Risks
6.03      The financial return of the project, calculated in Annex 6-5, and
based on present Romanian prices, is only 4.7% and is sensitive to changes
in product prices (Annex 6-6) but, given the Romanian financial system (para.
2.09), this return is not meaningful in determining the viability of the
project. Though the financial return is low, the expected financial ratios
of the Enterprise are satisfactory. The initially low debt service cov-
erage ratio is not considered a problem, since in practice the State in-
vests all funds in projects through the Investment Bank without formal on-
lending.
6.04      Since all funds necessary for the operation of the Enterprise will
be provided by the State, risks to the project are essentially limited to
its physical success, i.e. the successful and timely completion of the proj-
ect and full capacity operations. This risk is minimized by the requirement
that the contract for the main package of imported technology and equipment,
including the list of items to be supplied and adequate performance guaran-
tees, must be approved by the Bank as a condition of effectiveness of the
Bank loan (para 4.11). The plant to produce DMT as feedstock is under con-
struction in Pitesti and scheduled for completion in 1978 well before the
Cimpulung project becomes operational. Agreements have been obtained that
DMT from other plants in Romania or abroad will be made available to the
Enterprise, in the unlikely event that the new DMT plant is not on stream
at the time when CIMPULUNG starts operations (or cannot for other reasons
deliver the quantities required for the satisfactory operation of the proj-
ect). A realistic schedule for the construction of the project has already
been taken into account (para 4.12). The risk of less than full capacity
operations due to lack of demand is minimized by the Romanian practice of
drawing up annual sales plans for major enterprises. Furthermore, the cash
break-even point is 60%.
D. Fiscal Impact Analysis
6.05      In many economies where the state plays a central role in economic
development, one of the major constraints on investment and economic develop-
ment is the availability of funds for investment from the state budget.
Therefore, in such cases, it is also important to analyze how a project
affects the flow of state funds. In Romania, where there is no equivalent to a
corporate income tax and where the State owns and finances most enterprises
virtually on a 100% equity basis, 1/ all surplus funds are remitted to the
State on a predetermined basis. Annex 6-7 shows the fiscal impact of the
project.
1/   The proportion of investments financed by credit is very small in
Romania.



24 -
E. Auditing and Reporting
6.06      Rogiia has an elaborate control and audit system under which
enterprises submit periodic operational and financial reports to their cen-
tral, the technical ministry and the banks concerned. The centrals and the
technical ministries, in addition to a special unit of the the Ministry of
Finance and the National and Investment Banks, conduct extensive audits of
these reports to ensure achievement of Plan targets and proper use of funds.
Though the presentation and contents of some of these reports are somewhat
different from those normally received by the Bank, they can be adjusted to
provide sufficient information for the Bank to monitor adequately the prog-
ress of project implementation and operations. It has been agreed that the
CIMPULUNG Enterprise will submit quarterly and annual financial statements in
a format satisfactory to the Bank and that the Bank will receive copies of
annual audit reports prepared by the Ministry of Finance within four months
after the end of each fiscal year.
VII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Economic Rate of Return and Major Risks
7.01      Economic projections in constant 1976 dollars (Annex 7-1) were
made based on a number of assumptions on capital costs, economic prices, and
operating costs detailed in Annex 7-2. Based on these projections, the
project yields an economic rate of return of 15.6% (base case). Sensitivity
tests (Annex 7-3) are summarized below:
Economic Rate of Return
(in %)
% Change in Assumed Parameter
Up                Down
Parameter                                          10%    15%         10%    15%
Product Price                                      19.7   21.6        11.0    8.3
Feedstock Price                                    13.5   12.4        17.7   18.6
Capital Costs                                      14.1   13.4        17.4   18.4
Exchange Rate                                      14.4   13.0        17.1   17.8
The return is especially sensitive to polyester prices and raw material costs,
each percentage change in these factors resulting in a drop or gain of 0.4 and
0.2 percentage points respectively over the range shown in the table above.
B. Economic Price for Polyester
7.02      Since the project is unlikely to operate for any length of time at
less than capacity (para 6.02), the assumption made for the economic polyester



- 25 -
price is crucial. Prices for the Enterprise's products were valued on the
basis of the price projected for polyester staple (CIF European Common Market)
after an analysis of long-run demand and supply conditions (para 3.09), from
which the prices of other polyester products differ by relatively predictable
percentage spreads. Prices for products expected to be temporarily exported
were reduced by 2% to reflect the CIF-FOB differential and by a further 5%
discount deemed to be necessary for Danubiana to compete against foreign
unbranded fiber (para 3.18).
7.03      The projected basic polyester staple price (para 3.09) is con-
sidered conservative both on the basis of the assumptions made to derive it
and in the opinion of industry sources contacted by the Bank. Although poly-
ester prices have the strongest potential impact on the economic performance
of the project, the downside risk is therefore judged to be limited.
C. Raw Material Costs
7.04      Typical DMT and EG usage ratios were used.  The present price of
molten DMT in Western Europe is US244 per lb., that is 2£ higher than the
equivalent cost of TPA (pure terephtalic acid). 1/ Since the TPA technology
is increasingly used as an alternative to the DMT process, it is believed
that the long-run price of DMT will gradually decline to match the cost of
using TPA. To be conservative, DMT was nevertheless valued at an economic
price of 244 per lb. and EG was valued at its present West European price of
211 per lb.
D. Exchange Rates
7.05      For calculating the economic benefits and costs, international
prices have been used for imported equipment and materials, and the project's
outputs and tradable inputs. For local equipment and civil works, most
inventory components, labor and overhead, local prices were used, and trans-
lated at the official trading rate of 20 Lei per US dollar used by the Bank
for project appraisal. A sensitivity analysis conducted on the exchange
rate shows that a one percent change in the rate results in only 0.16 per-
centage point difference in the return.
E. Capital Costs
7.06      Compared to the parameters reviewed above, capital costs have
a more limited impact. Significant cost overruns are unlikely in the
Romanian system once a project has been officially approved and firm
cost estimates are therefore available. Furthermore, the economic return
calculation assumes that the economic (opportunity) value of locally procured
1/   In the US, prices for DMT and TPA are much closer.



- 26 -
fixed capital components would escalate at the same rate as imported equip-
ment, despite the fact that their financial prices in Romania are expected
to increase at a much smaller rate. Since only part of these components are
actually tradable, this is a conservative assumption.
F. Other Benefits
7.07      Although most of the benefits have already been largely or entirely
accounted for in the economic rate of return, the following benefits arising
from the project should be highlighted. The project will imply a substan-
tial transfer of modern technology (para 4.06) in both the chemical and the
machine-building industries. Some employment in related activities will be
created in the relatively poorly endowed agricultural area around Cimpulung.
The project, which involves foreign exchange capital costs of US$56.4 million,
will generate an average US$30 million in net annual foreign exchange earnings
and savings, thus contributing in a significant way to reducing the country's
convertible foreign exchange deficit.
VIII. AGREEMENTS
8.01      Agreements have been reached with the Government and the Investment
Bank on the following:
(a) project facilities will be operated with due regard
to ecological, environmental and safety aspects
(para 4.05);
(b) the Borrower will maintain and submit in time quar-
terly project progress reports (para 4.12);
(c) funds will be provided as needed to implement the
project and to meet any cost overrun (para 5.05);
(d) goods and services will be procured as indicated
in lists agreed upon (para 5.05);
(e) annual remittances of depreciation funds and benefits
by the Enterprise to the Investment Bank will be ade-
quate to cover debt service (para 5.06);
(f) feedstock requirements of the project will be met as
required for its successful operation (para 6.04);
(g) quarterly and annual financial statements in a format
satisfactory to the Bank will be timely submitted
(para 6.06); and
(h)  copies of the Enterprise's annual reports audited by the
Ministry of Finance will be timely submitted to the Bank
(para 6.06).



- 27 -
8.02      The conditions for the Bank Loan effectiveness are:  (a) establish-
ment of the Enterprise (para 2.07); (b) Bank approval of the contract for the
main technology/equipment procurement package, including adequate performance
guarantees (paras 4.11 and 6.04); and (c) approval by the Council of Ministers
of the technical and economic indicators for the project (para 5.05).
8.03      Based on the above agreements, the project provides a suitable
basis for a loan of US$50 million equivalent to the Investment Bank to be
repaid in 15 years, including three years of grace, at 8.2% interest rate.

UNITS AND CONVERSION FACTORS USED
IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY
Properties of Textile Fibers
The most important properties of textile fibers are: length,
fineness, crimp, strength, elasticity, resilience, spinning properties,
affinity for dyes, resistance to light and heat, and absorbency.
Length of individual fibers is generally given in inches or cm.
Crimp is measured by the ratio of the stretched fiber under standardized tension
to its length when left on a flat surface.
Spinnability and Dyeability are generally measured by means of ad-hoc tests
described in specific contracts between fiber/yarn manufacturers and users
and they have not been generally standardized.
Strength generally refers to tenacity or tensile strength and may be measured
in Kg/cm2, lbs/sq. in. or grams/denier (see below).
Fineness - Several measurement systems exist based on the length of a given
weight of fiber or yarn (in which case the large numbers correspond to the
finer materials) or by the weight of a given length (in which case the larger
numbers correspond to the thicker fibers or yarns). The main systems of
measurement are shown below.
Tex Number - The weight in grams of a fiber, yarn or strand
1000 m. long.
Denier - The weight in grams of a length of 9000 m. of fiber, yarn or
any strand of textile fibers.
Cotton Count (US and UK) - The number of 840 yard lengths (hanks)
contained in one lb. of cotton yarn.
Cotton Count (Continental)- The number of 1000 m hanks per one-half Kg.
Wool (Worsted) Count - The number of 560 yard hanks per lb.
Grex - The weight in grams of 10,000 m. of yarn.
TySpp- Number in thousands of yards per lb.
Metric Count - The number of Km-lengths per Kg.

ORGANIZATION OF THE SYNrHETIC FIBER IDIJSTRY
1.         The Industrial Center for the Synthetic Fib   Industry (Savinesti)
operates under the overall direction of the Ministry of Chemical Industries.
At present, the Central is comprised of only two enterp ises: Savinesti itself
and Iasi.  (As in other cases, some of the senior staff    the Central also
double as senior staff for parallel functions in the Savi esti enterprise,
which is the oldest of the two synthetic fiber enterprises)'  The Savinesti
enterprise comprises several plants with a total capacity of 35,000 TPY of
acrylics and 19,000 TPY of nylon.  Production capacity is scheduled to increase
by 5,000 TPY of filament yarn by the end of 1976. The Iasi enterprise currently
includes capacity for 51,700 TPY of PES, of which 9,000 TPY is filament. Estab-
lishment of three new enterprises and expansion of an existing one are planned
for start-up in the present decade as shown in the following table. Not
including the Vaslui project, which will be a downstream operation, total
synthetic fiber capacity in the country will increase by 65% from 110,700 TPY
in 1977 to 182,400 TPY by 1980. (See table at end of Annex.)
2.         The Ministry of Chemical Industries is in charge of all national
activities in the subsector and in particular: (1) translating the national
economic objectives into production targets for the subsector; (ii) preparing
the important projects which are required to meet these targets; (iii) ensuring
that the production and financial results of individual chemical industries
conform to the Five-Year and Annual Plans; (iv) coordinating the subsector's
activities with those of other industrial subsectors and other sectors of
the economy; and, (v) approving all important chemical industry investment
projects.
3.         The insertion of Industrial Centrals between the Ministry of
Industrial Chemistry (as in the case of other "technical" Ministries) and its
industrial enterprises was the main institutional element in the decision taken
in 1967 (which was actually carried out in 1969) to integrate establishments
making similar products, using similar manufacturing processes, having com-
plementary profiles, contributing to a close vertical integration of manufac-
turing processes, or cooperating in the production of similar fixed assets.
The primary functions of the Centrals are generally concentrated in: (a) the
consolidation of production, consumption and financial data received from the
enterprises; (b) the planning of annual and five-year production targets, and
(c) the preparation of financial projections for the synthetic fiber industry.
The Central coordinates the preparation of the enterprises' five-year and
annual production and financial plans and participates in the allocation of
production targets to the enterprises grouped in the Central (on the basis of
industry production targets) but it plays only a minor role in the actual
daily operation of the enterprises. The Central reinforces the enterprises'
design and engineering capabilities where they are needed, helps in conducting
negotiations for the sale pf products or the acquisition of supplies and, in
general, will aid the enterprises in solving troublesome problems.



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
4.         The Savinesti Central, as most Industrial Centrals, has five main
departments: production, commercial, finances and accounting, technical
operations, and administrative and personnel (Annex 2-3). It also supervises
a technical school, a research center, a chemistiryschool, a data processing
unit, a joint Romanian-Italian enterprise, and the quality control department.
The General Director or Manager of the Central supervises hierarchically the
functioning of the enterprises. Informal functional relations between similar
departments (i.e. accounting or quality control) are also established directly
between the Central's and enterprises' concerned units. Overall direction of
the Central is vested on the General Assembly comprising a large number of
representatives (including the directors of the enterprises within the Central's
jurisdiction and a representative of the General Council of Trade Unions). This
body normally meets only twice a year and operations are directed through an
Executive Committee of the Working People with 5-9 members, which includes a
representative of the Central's workers.
5.         The enterprises, in general, are primarily production-oriented
organizations with limited decision-making responsibilities. But they have
their own production plans (based on the targets set by the Five-Year and the
Annual Plans for the Central) and have their own bank accounts, prepare separate
financial statements, sign contracts for the sale or acquisition of products
and materials, and can borrow money from appropriate banks. They also maintain
economic, financial and legal relations with other organizations (supervised by
or consolidated through the Central). However, any major changes in their
organizational structure, investment programs, location of plant facilities,
production targets or product mix must be approved by the Ministry of Chemical
Industries or the Council of Ministers.
6.         The enterprise's organization structure is shown in Annex 2-4.
Decision-qmaking power lies technically with the Workers' General Assembly,
which includes all the workers of the enterprise and normally meets twice
a year to examine the operating results and review the performance of the
Working People's Executive Committee. This Executive Committee, consisting
of elected representatives of workers and also some key members of the manage-
ment, is chaired by the General Manager of the Enterprise, appointed by the
Minister of Chemical Industries. The Director is responsible for the day-to-
day operations and the implementation of the decisions taken by the Executive
Committee through a team consisting of a technical manager responsible for sales
and procurement, and a chief accountant responsible for finance and accounting.
This organizational set-up is considered appropriate for the attainment of the
production and cost objectives of the enterprises operating in Romania.
7.         Also under the Ministry of Chemical Industries are the following
agencies:
(a)  IPROCHIlM', the Process Design and En Ineering
Institute for Chemical Industry._
(b) IPUC, the Construction Engineering Agency for
Chemical Industry.l/
(c) ROMCHIM, the Import Agency for Chemical Equipment
and technology; and
1/ At present merged into IITPIC, the Technological Engineering and Design
Institute for Chemical Industry.

(d) I.S.C.E. Danubiana, a company formed in 1975 by the
merger of three former foreign trade organizations
belonging to the Ministry of Chemical Industry
(Azoexport, Danubiana and Fibrex); this company is
the exclusive exporter for products from the fer-
tilizer, rubber, plastic and synthetic fiber
industries and also imports raw materials for these
industries.

ANNEX 3-1

ROMANIA - CINPUlUNG-MUSCEL POLYESTER PRLJECT
_GEIRAL MPJUT BACKGROUND
Fibers
1.        Owing largely to the multiplicity of fiber types and stages of
processing, the terms used to describe textile fibers, processes and markets
are at times confusing. For purposes of ¢larity, this Annex describes the
general industry background. Precise definitions for technical terms are
given in the Glossary (Annex 1-1).
2.        Textile fibers are classified into natural fibers (such as cotton,
wool or flax, to cite the most important ones) and man-made fibers.  It is
customary to divide the latter group into:  artificial, cellulosic fibers
which in this and the following Annexes will be called cellulosics (i.e.
rayons, acetates and polynosics which use mainly woodpulp as raw material);
synthetic fibers (produced mostly from petrochemical feedstocks); and in-
organic fibers (mainly glass fiber). The main types of synthetic fibers
are acr-lics. polyamides (nylon), Polyesters and polyolefins.  Man-made
fibers are produced either as ff  =mint La  (or simply filament) which can be
knit directly without going through the spinning process, or staple fibers
(or simply staple) which are processed in a spinning mill, either alone or
blended with other natural or man-made fibers, into spun yarn. Man-made fibers
of the latter group are often traded as tow (continuous strands of fibers not yet cut
into staple) or top (staple fibers conviered to packages of discontinuous strands
which are the iniemediate state between staple and yarn, and are used mostly for
blending wool).
Textiles
3.        The products of the textile industry include spun yarn produced
in spinning mills, and fabrics. which are usually made by weaving or knitting 
spun yarn produced by the spinning mills or filament yarn produced directly
by the man-made fiber industry.
End Uses of Textiles
4.        The word clothing as referred to in this Annex and the following
Annexes includes woven clothes and knitted goods. Other uses for products
of the fiber and textile industries, besides clothing, consist of the so-
called household made-up articles (such as blankets, bedlinen, curtains
and upholstery)  carpets and industrial items (such as rope, tire cord, fishing
nets or V-belts5. The following table provides an idea of the relative
importance of each type of end-use in the USA and the European Economic
Community (EEC)V/. In industrial countries, about half of the textile fibers
are ultimately used to make clothing, roughly one third go into carpets and
household articles, and one sixth into various industrial uses.

Mill and Home Consumption of Fibers
5.        The concept of mill consumption r fers to the amount of a fiber
supplied to the domestic textile industry-  and is therefore an indicator of
the production achieved by this industry rather than one of final consumption.
It is calculated by adding together for each fiber the locally produced amount
and the net imports (exports) of that fiber (in its raw form). On the other
hand, at the country or regional level, the concept of home consumption refers
to the amount of a  fiber finally available to the consumers nder the form
of yarn, fabrics, clothing and other goods made from fibers. *To measure home
consumption, the estimated mill consumption and the equivalent raw fiber con-
tent of the net imports (exports) of textile goods and clothing are added
together. As defined above, these indicators are not adjusted for changes in
stocks of fiber products in mills or elsewhere in the distributive channels
and therefore they do not represent the actual mill and consumer off-take,
but are only indicative of the amounts of fiber available to textile mills
and end-users respectively.
2/ Including family and cottage spinning and weaving.
"Textile fiber availability" is often used as a more accurate substitute
expression for "home consumption".

THE WORLD FIBER MARKET: TRENDS AND PROSPECTS
Trends in World Fiber Consumption
1.        World consumption of major fibers on a weight basis increased
from 17.8 million tons in 1964 to 26.3 million tons in 1974 (Table 1),    1/
attaining an average annual compound growth rate of 4.5% over that period.-
It decreased nevertheless by about 10% between 1974 and 1975, so that the
average 1964-1975 growth rate has been only 3.9% per annum (Table 2).
This moderate overall growth has not been uniform, with a relatively slow
growth between 1964 and 1967 (0.6% per year), and after 1967 a rapid period
of expansion of consumption (5.8% per year) culminating in the boom year of
1973. This period has been followed by the 1974/75 market recession, one
of the worst experienced by the fibers industry, and which seems to have
been due to a combination of the general economic recession with a down
turn in the textile cycle. Although fiber demand has recovered significantly
since its lowest point in early and mid-1975, it has not yet reached the
level attained in 1973 and 1974.
Change in World Fiber Consumption Patterns
2.        The last decade has also witnessed a dramatic change in consumption
patterns. Consumption of cotton increased only moderately over the 1964-1975
period (1.8% a year) and its share of total textile fiber consumption
declined steadily from 63.5% in 1964 to 50.2% in 1975, while consumption of
cellulosics has declined precipitously (by more than 20%) in the last two
years bringing average annual growth for the 1964-1975 period to only 0.2%.
3.        Synthetic fibers have benefited from high growth rates which have
enabled them to capture a significant market share of 31.2% in 1975; up from
less than 10% in 1964 (Table 3). They have thus more than compensated for
the decline in the share of cellulosics and succeeded in bringing the over-
all share of man-made fibers to 43.8% in 1975 up from 28.1% in 1964. This
achievement has been mostly due to spectacular growth rates in the consumption
of polyester fibers, averaging 26% a year over the decade. This growth rate
has slowed down recently, but polyester is the only major fiber which has
continued to show an increase in consumption after the market levelled off
and entered the 1974/75 recession.
Factors in Inter-fiber Competition
4.        Inter-fiber competition has largely centered around quality and
performance considerations, price competitiveness, product development and
promotion and the ability of the producers to assure a consistent supply at
1/ Between 1955 and 1974 the average growth rate was 4.0% per year. The
analysis contained in this Annex, however, is limited to the 1964-1975
period due to lack of strict comparability of prior data.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 2
a relatively stable price. With respect to quality and performance, the
general advantage of man-made fibers is that they have many of the
properties possessed by natural fibers and, in addition, have many other
desirable properties. This is particularly evident in the case of
polyester fibers and explains much of the substantial inroads of polyester
staple into traditional cotton and wool uses through blending. Its
strength and durability, abrasion resistance, low shrinking, low density,
quick drying, and especially "easy care" characteristicsl/ have made it
particularly suitable for a wide range of clothing, particularly when com-
bined with comfortable, humidity absorbing properties of natural fibers,
cotton mainly, but also wool and flax.
5.        Although cotton and polyester have many complementary
characteristics, cellulosics, and in particular rayon, retain their
capacity to substitute for cotton in many uses. They nevertheless find
it more and more difficult to compete with other fibers mai-ly for cost
reasons (see below) but also in view of their low performance with
respect to durability and shrinkage in washing. For technical reasons,
nylon and acrylic fibers have competed more closely with wool and silk.
In uses other than clothing, where body comfort is not a factor, such as
tire cord and industrial applications, the superior performance of
industrial polyester and nylon yarns has resulted in the virtually complete
displacement of natural fibers and cellulosics. For similar reasons,
synthetics have made significant inroads into the share which natural
fibers held in the manufacture of household made-up articles.
6.        Inter-fiber competition during the last decade has also been
strongly influenced by movements in the relative prices of the main fibers
(Table 4). For many years, the consumption of cellulosics and cotton
shifted on rather small changes in relative prices. Rising costs of raw
materials and pollution control problems have led to sharp increases in
the price of cellulosics and to insufficient returns which have stalled
the growth of their output. Polyester on the contrary has steadily
improved its price competitiveness with regard to natural fibers, and in
particular cotton.  While the price of polyester staple fiber in the USA-/
used to be more than three times the average price of cotton in 1960, it
declined so rapidly that by 1972, it fell below the cotton price3/, con-
tributing in a major way to the spectacular growth of polyester fiber
consumption. Although polyester lost again part of its price advantage
during 1975, it has fully regained it during the course of the present
year, with cotton prices rising to high levels due to a com-
bination of the revival of total fiber demand with reduced production
during the 1975/76 season.
1 For definition of easy-care properties, see Annex 1-1.
2/ Cotton and polyester staple prices in the USA have been generally lower
than in most other countries, but the relationship between these prices
is an acceptable proxy of the international situation.
3 On a utility poundage basis, polyester cost as little as cotton from 1968
onwards.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 3
7.        Finally, inter-fiber competition has also been influenced by the
sharp differences in the organization of production and marketing of man-
made and natural fibers. Man-made fibers are produced in large industrial
units, allowing for a relatively flexible response to short-run changes in
demand and a closely controlled marketing program, including resources for
market research, product and customer development and promotional
activities, often centered around brand names. There is no doubt that
these efforts have contributed to the successful introduction of man-made
fibers and especially polyester. Furthermore, a relative stability of
prices and supply conditions for synthetics has been achieved through the
oligopolistic structure of the industry or even, in Western Europe mainly,
through wide-spread cartel practices. By contrast, producers of natural
fibers are largely unorganized. There are exceptions to this in national
and international research and marketing programs for cotton and wool;
however, due to financial limitations, these efforts are often dwarfed by
comparison with those of the man-made fiber industry. Moreover, the pro-
duction of natural fibers cannot change on short notice and is subject to
variable weather and pest conditions, while their market prices are subject
to sometimes upsetting speculative buying practices as a hedge against
inflation or anticipated devaluations.
Regional Trends in Home Consumption
8.        Home and mill consumption of textile fibers should be clearly
distinguished since there is no direct relationship between them. While
home consumption depends in a relatively predictable way on such factors
as population growth, per capita incomes, social parameters or even
climatic factors, mill consumption can be smaller or larger than home con-
sumption according to whether the country is a net importer or exporter of
textiles and clothingl/.
9.        Table 5 shows trends in home consumption of textile fibers for
major countries and groups of countries over the period 19672/ to 1974.
It shows that the highest growth rate in home consumption of fibers have
been scored by the Centrally Planned Economies (CPEs) with an average 5.8%
per year, and by the Developing Countries (LDCs) with 4.5% per year. This
has been accompanied by a decline in the share of total world fiber con-
sumption held by the Developed Countries. The USSR and Eastern Europe
group as well as the LDCs as a whole showed a modest increase in their
share of world consumption. Among the latter, the Asian and Far Eastern
LDCs even saw their share decline while the African and especially the
Latin American and the Near Eastern LDCs achieved significant increases.
1/ The most striking example is Hong Kong, whose total fiber mill con-
sumption equalled 2.8 times its home consumption in 1974.
2/ Earlier per capita consumption figures present problems of statistical
comparability and have therefore not been included in the analysis.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 4
Regional Trends in Per Capita Home Consumption
10.       For the world as a whole, the growth rate of total fiber con-
sumption between 1967-69 and 1974 reflected an average 1.9% per year
population growth together wish a 2.3% per year increase in the average
per capita fiber consumption-1. Absolute per capita consumption figures
are given in Table 6 and show large divergences between regions, with at
one extreme the average 3 kgs per inhabitant observed for LDCs as a
whole and at the other the high levels achieved by the Developed
Countries (22 kg for North America and about 14.5 kg for Japan and the
EEC). The average for CPEs is kept low (6 kg) by the modest level of
per capita consumption in Mainland China and other Asian CPEs, which
weigh against the relatively high per capita consumption achieved by the
USSR and Eastern Europe as a group (13.7 kg).
11.       Since population growth forecasts are available, fiber con-
sumption projections can be made based on the evolution of per capita
fiber consumption. Although the latter depends on various social and
other parameters, statistical evidence suggests that more than 80% of
the variations are explained in terms of per capita income-elasticities.
Based on an analysis of average 1971-1973 cross-sectional data, per
capita income elasticities are shown in Table 7 for all fibers and for
cotton alone.
12.       The income-elasticities for per capita home consumption of all
fibers appears to be significantly higher in regions with a low per
capita consumption base. The low elasticity for Developed Countries is
partly an outcome of declining marginal satisfaction from additional use
at high per capita consumption levels2/ and partly of changing mores
which might have brought about a reduction in the perceived amount of
clothing socially required. The spread between the income elasticities
of different regions is even more pronounced in the case of cotton alone,
with Developed Countries showing a virtually negligible income elasticity
for per capita cotton consumption.
Regional Trends and Patterns in Mill Consumption
13.       The Developed Countries' share of the world's mill consumption has
decluned even more rapidly than that of home consumption and stands now at less
than one half of the world's total (Table 8). This declune has been accompanied
by a significant increase an the share of LDCs, particularly in Africa, Latin
America and the Near East3 .
1/ The population and per capita consumption growth rates, however, differ
widely for different regions (Table 5).
2/ Data for a number of Developed Countries show a clear trend towards
declining proportion of consumer spending on clothing as income rises.
See "The Textile Industry in OECD Countries", Table 25, OECD 1976.
3/ Although this is outside the scope of this Annex, it is significant to
note that between 1970 and 1974, exports of textiles and clothing by
LDCs have increased at the average annual rate of 28°/ and 38% respectively.

Bank's Development Economics Department on this subject is being prepared.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 5
14.       As stated above (paras. 2 and 3) the inter-fiber configuration
of mill consumption has changed dramatically over the last decade, with
cotton and the other natural fibers losing ground to man-made and
especially synthetic fibers. Table 9 illustrates the regional variations
in this general trend between 1967 and 1974. Despite a certain reduction
in the share which cotton has traditionally occupied in their total mill
consumption, the LDCs and the CPEs still use more than twice as much
cotton as the Developed Countries do. The share of cellulosics has de-
clined in each region accounting now for only about 8% of mill consumption
in LDCs, 16% in Developed Countries and CPEs and a still high - but
declining - 22% in the Eastern European socialist countries. Synthetics
account for about 48% of total mill consumption in the Developed Countries.
Although their share in other regions of the world is still much smaller,
it has increased between 2.5 and 3 times in CPEs and LDCs between 1967 and
1974 against only 1.5 times in the Developed Countries, indicating a
tapering off of the substitution rate in the later stages of the
substitution process.
Projections of Total Fiber Demand
15.       Based on the elasticities shown in Table 7 and on current Bank
projections for population and income over the 1975-1985 period, and on
the actual 1975 consumption figure, total world fiber demand is projected
to grow from about 24 to 34.5 million tons over the period 1975-1985, or
by 3.9% per year on the average, (Table 10). This growth rate is consistent
with forecasts made elsewhere-/. Demand would grow at 6.6% and 4.2% a
year in LDCs and CPEs respectively, i.e. about three and two times faster
than in Developed Countries (2.1% a year). On an average, one third of the
total increase in consumption will be attributable to population growth and
two thirds to increased per capita consumption levels.
16.       Using the 1975 figures as a starting point presumes that the
depressed level of consumption in that year represents a once-and-for-all
downwards shift in the trend line, and not a temporary lapse with no bearing
on the long run demand potential. If the 1973-74 average amounting to 26.3
million tons were used in lieu of the actual 1975 estimate, the projected
demand for 1985 would reach about 38.5 million tons rather than only 34.5
million tons, a difference of about 12%.
Demand Prospects for Polyester Fibers in Developed Countries
17.       Projections of demand for the major natural and man-made fibers in
Developed Countries have been prepared based on per capita income elasticities
of demands for each fiber as well as population and income growth forecasts
1/ Werner International, a specialized consulting firm based in Europe, fore-
casts total world fiber consumption to grow an average of about 4% a year
between 1975 and 1990.

for this group of countries. Since the distribution of future demand
for various fibers depends on a rather complex set of factors of an
economic, social or even technical nature, it was judged that these
could be more reliably predicted for Developed Countriesl/ which
accounts for three-quarters of the world's polyester fiber production.
Because the main purpose of this analysis is to assess the market
potential for polyester fibers and for the Cimpulung Project in
particular, this approach is considered appropriate in view of the fact
that the project's output will substitute for staple imports from, and
for a limited period of time compete with exports to, Developed
Countries (para 11). The relative growth prospects for each group of
fibers has been assessed in terms of absolute and/or relative income-
elasticities of per capita consumption, both to make full use of those
calculated in Table 7 and to focus the analysis on the relative
prospects of the different fibers, by disregarding temporarily popu-
lation growth.
18.       Most sources forecast a stagnation in the total production and
consumption of wool over the next decade, on account of its price, the
limited possibilities of expanding production and continued inroads by
acrylics. With increasing income levels, this actually would mean that
the per capita income-elasticity of wool could be negative./.  Neverthe-
less, a conservative zero elasticity for wool in Developed Countries was
assumed for the purpose of this analysis.
19.       The per capita income-elasticity of cotton consumption was
estimated in Table 7 at 0.05 for Developed Countries. Since this figure
is based on cross-sectional data, it could be argued that it might not
correctly account for the larger share which cotton could regain over
the coming decade in those uses where rayon has been a substitute for it,
as the cotton/rayon price ratio further declines. (Bank commodity price
forecasts show the price of cotton as low as 6 fi per pound - in 1976
constant prices - over the medium to long termn-. Rather than trying to
forecast the magnitude of this shift from rayon back to cotton, these two
fibers have been put together for the purpose of assigning a per capita
income elasticity to the group as a whole, namely the one found for cotton.
20.       For the same reasons, any gains over and above its normal
growth trend which might be scored by nylon over acetate filament yarn,
with which it competes in the lingeries, hosiery and swimwear market
1/ A variety of articles found in trade and other journals discuss the
future prospects of different fibers in the USA and the EEC and exten-
sive data exist on the prices, production costs and end-uses of
different fibers in these countries. Similar information for LDCs and
CPEs is scarce.
2/ In the same way, demand for less important natural fibers such as flax
is expected to decline or stagnate, except in certain Western and
Eastern European countries in which they have traditionally been in
extensive use and where additional per capita consumption could be
triggered by the introduction of new blended fabrics based on these
fibers.

Price Forecasts, November 1976.

could be disregarded for the purpose of this analysis by lumping both
fibers together and attributing as a per capita elasticity to the entire
group the one estimated for nylon alone. Taking into account the more
limited potential of nylon compared to other synthetics, such as polyester,
because of its comparatively late stage in the product life cycle aid its
narrower range of uses, its per capita income-elasticity in Developed
countries has been conservatively assumed to be 0.50 (about 50%) higher
than the total fiber elasticity). The growth of acrylics in the past
decade has been mostly substitution related and they will continue to
compensate for the projected stagnation of wool demand and production.
Like for nylon and polyester fibers, one would expect its per capita
income elasticity to lie above the total fiber elasticity. Despite the
more narrow range of possibilities with acrylic staple compared to polyester
staple, it has been conservatively assumed that it will grow at about the
same speed as it did relatively to the latterl!/ during the last decade, i.e.
at about half the polyester staple growth rate and with a per capita income-
elasticity of the same relative magnitude.
21.       In assessing the prospects for polyester fibers, it is necessary
to distinguish polyester staple and filament yarn. The ascent of polyester
filament yarn until 1973-74 had been favored by technical developments in
the processing of fibers through the increased use of the technique of
knitting filament yarn into fabric, at a lower cost than staple fibers
could be spun into yarn and then woven into cloth. This trend towards
knitted fabrics such as polyester double-knits, has never materialized.  In
particular, large capacity additions have led to a dramatic situation of
over-supply of polyester filament yarn in Developed Countries. Although a
weak improvement has been registered this year, both in terms of prices and
demand, it is safe to assume that demand for polyester filament yarn in
Developed Countries will not grow from its present levels over and above
population growth, so 2hat its per capita income elasticity can be
considered negligible2-.
22.       Compared to polyester filament and other natural and man-made
fibers, cotton-and wool-type polyester staple has continued to experience
a relatively healthy demand through the recent depression of the total
fiber market. Looking into the future, the prospects for this versatile
fiber over the next decade appear strong. Polyester staple is, in
particular, expected to keep a significant cost advantage over cotton,
since its projected long term price, estimated at 75¢ per pound in constant
1976 dollars (see para 28) compares favorable with the long-term price of
1/ Which has begun to compete with acrylics in the form of wool-type staple.
2/ This might appear overly pessimistic in view of industry expectations,
notably regarding the potential for polyester filament in non-apparel
uses, where it could challenge nylon filament yarn both on cost grounds
and on account of low photodegradability (an important feature for
draperies). For apparel uses though, it is doubtful that the demand for
polyester double-knits could be revived above its present per capita
level.  See Wall Street Journal, Nov. 19, 1976, page 48.



ANNEX 3-2
Page 8
65¢/lb projected for cotton (para 19), taking into account that on a
utility poundage basis, between 20% and 30% more cotton is required
than polyester staple. Further increases in oil prices are not likely
to change these long term relative price relationships since the costs
of producing both fibers appear to be about equally sensitive to such
increasesl/.
23.       Based on the assumptions made above with respect to the esti-
mated absolute and/or relative income-elasticities of the different
type of fibers, average per annum growth rates have been projected for
the demand of major fibers in Developed Countries over the 1975-85
period (Table 11). According to these projections, demand for PES
staple in these countries would grow at about 6% a year while acrylics
and nylon would grow at 2.5% and 3.5% a year respectively.  The
relative magnitude of these growth sates in the various synthetics is
in line with historical experience.2 . In absolute terms, the pro-
jections for synthetics are on the conservative side, mainly in view
of the optimistic assumptions made for cotton and rayon, as well as
wool demand. Had one, at the other extreme, assumed near stagnation in
the demand for these fibers in Developed Countries, the projected growth
rates for synthetics would have been increased dramatically, with PES
staple groMing at slightly more than 9% per annum.
Production Capacity Situation and Prospects for Polyester Fibers in
Developed Countries
24.       Table 12 summarizes developments on production capacity and
capacity utilization between 1970 and 1975 for the three main synthetic
fibers in the world, Developed Countries and Eastern Europe. Polyester
fibers producers have--despite dramatic increases in production
capacity--enjoyed the highest average utilization between 1970 and 1975
in both the major Developed Countries and in Eastern Europe. Despite
this, capacity utilization for polyester has fallen sharply to a world
average of 77% which, however, is not as low as that for nylon and
acrylics, except in Western Europe, where all three types of fibers
have suffered equally in 1975. Western Europe and Japan have also
experienced more erratic fluctuations in the utilization of their
polyester fiber plants (see standard deviations in Table 12' unlike the
US., which still heavily dominates the world market- . Within the
polyester fiber group, capacity utilization has been about the same
between 1970 and into early 1975 for both filament yarn and staple,
although in the case of the former, this seems to have been achieved in
part through unusually large inventory build-ups during the end of the
period.

3/ And unlike the Eastern European countries, which have consistently

ANNEX 3-2
Page 9
25.       Since early 1975 there has been a steady recovery in capacity
utilization for polyester staple, and to a lesser extent nylon and
acrylics, while the polyester filament yarn industry now faces an overt
crisip  with capacity utilization down to 50-55% and going prices below
costs     Capacity utilization for polyester staple has, on the contrary,
recently recovered to about 85% in the USA and 75-80% in Western Europe,
where the textile demand still shows weaker signs of recovery.
26.       Projected additions of production capacity until 1980 obtained
from consultants are shown in Table 13, indicating that in Developed
Countries capacity would grow between 1975 and 1980 at an annual 4.6%
rate for staple and 6.9% for filament. These projections having been
made before the recession are, however, likely to be outdated, especially
as far as filament is concerned. It is nonetheless convenient to use the
projections for capacity additions in polyester staple as a conservative
benchmark. Based on these projections, and assuming that at present
capacity utilization is 80% on average in Developed Countries, a simple
calculation shows that demand for polyester staple in these countries,
projected on the basis of the conservative 6% annual growth rate estab-
lished in Table 11, would catch up with production capacity by 1983. For
polyester filament, it seems difficult to make similar predictions as to
when demand and supply will balance out, since this depends largely on
the timing and the magnitude of the shake-out expected in this industry.
Price Forecast for Polyester Staple Fibers
27.       It is widely acknowledged that present prices for polyester
staple and especially polyester filament do not yield sufficient returns
to industry. As shown in Table 4, polyester staple sold in mid-1976 at
about 55¢ per pound in the USA.  At that time, the Western European price
was around 60¢ (synthetic fiber prices in the USA have been generally
lower than in most countries due to oil and gas price regulations). An
attempt has therefore been made to estimate the price for polyester staple
which would prevail under balanced supply and demand conditions. Based
on the premise that the long-run average cost structure in Developed
Countries will more closely reflect the Western European feedstock costs2/,
the economic price for staple3./ was calculated as the one yielding a 25% to
30% return (figure quoted by industry sources as a minimal condition for
new investment in the sector), before income tax and in current prices, to
a pro-forma economic size plant similar to the Cimpulung project and I
located in Western Europe. Capital costs for such a plant, obtained by
averaging four sets of data supplied by an experienced consultant hired by
the Bank amount to about US$90 million. Manufacturing costs were also
supplied by consultants. Pro-forma projections are given in Table 14.
1/ Polyester filament prices have fallen within two years from $1.1-1.2 to
50-55¢~ per pound by mid-1976.
2/ In agreement with the widely held view that oil and gas prices will
eventually be deregulated in the US.
3/ The price of polyester staple can be considered as the basic price, with
those of other related products, such as tow or tops differeing from the
former by a relatively stable and predictable percentage spread.

28.       On the basis of these, it appears that at the mid-1976 level of
Western European staple prices, i.e. about 60, per pound, such a plant
would yield only a 16% return DCF (discounted cash flow~ and 16% ROI
(accountant's return on investment), respectively. The percentage price
increases over the mid-1976 price level needed to yield a given current
price return as follows:
To get a DCF returni/of:  20% . . . . . . . . . 7%
25%   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  18%
30%   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  30%
To get a ROI return-/of:  20% . . . . . . . . . 7%
25%   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  15%
30%   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  23%
Based on these results, it appears that prices of polyester staple in
Western Europe would have to increase by 20% to 30% over their mid-1976
level in order to satisfy the criteria currently used by industry for
new economical investments in this sector. On average, this would imply
a staple price of 75¢ per pound, which can be considered a conservative
estimate of the long-run economic price, expressed in 1976 constant
dollars.
29.       Due to the present situation of over-capacity, it has been
assumed that the actual polyester staple prices (also expressed in 1976
dollars) will only gradually move towards the long-run price of 75¢ so
as to attain it by 1983 when demand is more in line with capacity (see
para 26):
Year                  PES Staple Price
(in ¢ per pound at
1976 dollars)
1976 (mid year)2/           60.0
1977                        62.0
1978                        64.0
1979                        66.0
1980                        68.2
1981                        70.4
1982                        72.7
1983                        75.0
This price forecast has been based on a number of assumptions judged to be
conservative and should therefore provide a reasonable basis for assessing
the economic benefits of the proposed project.
1/ DCF returns are the better measure when it comes to evaluating the actual
profitability of an investment. However, since many in the industry still
use the average accounting ROI criterion both for purposes of pricing
and profitability assessment, it is useful to show also the ROI-based
economic prices.
.  Western European list prices were increased to 67-690 per lb. after
November 1976.

CONISUMPTION AND PRODUCTION OF TEXTILE FIBERS IN ROMANIA
Trends in Romanian Production, Trade and Mill Consumption of Fibers
1.          Total Romanian fiber production (as shown in Table 1 summarized below)
has grown at an annual rate of 18.4% over the last decade from its relatively small
base in 1965. Vhile in 1965 production met only 28.3% of total mill consumption
needs, it now provides for about 63.7%. As in other countries, this growth has
been centered around man-made fibers and especially synthetics.

2.         IWith local fiber prociuction growing at a quick pace, fiber imports went
up by only 4.7% a year.  Cotton maintained its share of about 75% OI the total im-
port tonnage between 1965 and 1975. Exports of fibers, on the other hand, grew
rapidly from a virtually negligible base in 1965. Synthetics accounted for about
85% oi the total export volume in 1975 but they represented only about 2% of total
imports of synthetics by Developed Countries.l/ Despite increased fiber exports,
Romania st ll remains heavily dependent on fiber imports; its net trade deficit in
fibers has actually increased between 1965 and 1975, although at the small rate of
2.5, a year.

3.          Total fiber mill consumption has grown at 9.L% a year over the last
decade -- a relatively modest growth compared to other industrial activities in
Romania. At the same time, however, the structure of mill consumption has changed
dramatically. Table 2 highlights this by comparing the country's average mill
consumption ratios for major fibers both over time and to similar ratios for Dev-
eloped Countries as a whole. Romania has significantly reduced the share of cotton
from over 50% of total fiber mill consumption in 1965 down to 35% in 1975. (In
comparison, Developed Countries showed a ratio oI 31% in 197L)1/  This reduction
has resulted mostly from increased use of synthetics, since the share of cellulo-
sics in Ronania has increased only moderately between 1965 and 1975.  Cellulos ics
nevertheless account for 30% of total mill consumption, against only 15% in
Developed Countries where consumption of cellulosics, and mainly rayon, is dim-
inishing (Annex 3-2). As in other countries, use of polyester fibers grew fastest
among all synthetics. Their share of Romanian mill consumption, however, is only
about half of the share held by polyester fibers in Developed Countries in 1971,
showing that they have a significant potential for further su':stitution of other
fibers, mainly cotton and cellulosics.
Trends in Romanian Home Consumption and Trade in Textiles and Clothing
21
14.         Table   shows that between 1971  and 1975, total home consumption in
Roomania grew 12.1% annually, or faster than the 9.14% average annual rate of in-
crease in mill consumption. During the same period, national income grew at 11.3% a
year3/. Per capita home consumption went up from 7.3 Kg. in 1971 to 11.2 Kg. in
1975. These figures appear relatively low compared to averages of 11.0 Kg. in
1967-69 and 13.7 Kg. in 19714 in the USSR and Eastern Europe as a whole and of
114.6 Kg. and 16.6 Kg. for the same years respectively in Developed Countries.
Romania should therefore be expected to further increase its per capita home
consumption as it catches up economically with the more developed Eastern
.^uropean CPES and with the lower tier of Developed Countries.
The fast growth of home consumption relative to mill consumption
between 1971 and 1975 has also resulted in virtual stagnation of Romania's net
trade surplus in textiles and clothing at a level of about 50,000 tons. There
has, hawever, been a shift in the composition of the trade surplus, with the
balance for textiles (i.e. spun yarn and fabrics) having turned negative between
1971 and 1975 while the country was increasing its net exports of clothing, al-
though at the relatively low rate of h.6% a year (at a time when exports of
clothing by LDCs as a whole grew at about 38% a year).  Although the proportion
of ilomania's textile and clothing exports to Conecon countries has been reduced
considerably in the last ten years (it was 92% in 1965, 76.7% in 1970 and 51.9%
in 1973L/), preliminary information for 1976 shows that the USSR is still the
mair importer of Romanian clothing.  Romnania's share of total clotLing imports
1/ Although the share of cotton for Western Europe only was as
low as 25% (see Table 9, ;.nnex 3-2).
2/ Data for earlier years are not available or present statistical
problems; recent FAO per capita estimates in particular show
large enough divergences with Romanian data to render the use
of FAO data for earlier years statistically inconsistent.

the future.2/
Projections of Production and Mill Consumption in Romania
6.        On the basis of the 1976-80 Five-Year Plan, The Investment Bank
provided the Bank with the production, consumption and foreign trade forecasts
for natural and synthetic fibers. The Bank reviewed these
projections and after discussing them with the Romanian authorities, new
projections were prepared (Table 4) to reflect: (i) predictable slippages in
the start-up and implementation of projects known to the Bank; (ii) a downwards
revision of future production of rayon, which were at wide variance with world-
wide trendsi' and were not based on firm projects, (iii) small adjustments
considered to be realistic, in the production of natural fibers; and (iv) cor-
rections of small errors.
7.        The projections for the second part of the decade (1980-85) were
based,as far as mill consumption is concerned, on very aggregated figures used
as long-term planning indicators. These were broken down by type of fiber by
the Mission in such a way as to produce a structure of mill consumption by 1985
which would appear reasonable in the light of the trends followed in this respect
by Developed Countries (Table 5). The 1985 production figures (Table 5) are
based on existing man-made fiber projects only, since no new projects to be
implemented during the next Five Year Plan period could yet be identified pending
the elaboration of the next Plan.
8.        Total mill consumption is expected to grow from 290 to about 580
thousand tons between 1975 and 1985 at an average annual growth rate of 7.1%,
i.e. only about three fourths of the rate which has prevailed between 1965 and
1975. Mill consumption of total synthetics is expected to grow at 12% a year,
against 5% and 4% for natural fibers and cellulosics respectively, indicating
a continued process of substitution. The share of synthetics in Romanian mill
consumption by 1985 would nevertheless remain significantly below the share held
by these fibers in Developed Countries at the present time. (Table 5).
1/ Source: Romanian trade data and World Trade Matrix in U.N. Monthly
Statistical Bulletin (August 1976 Issue).
2/ Romania is the first CMIECON country to have signed an accord with the EEC
under the terms of GATT's Multi-Fiber Agreement. The accord, signed in Nov. 76,
gives Romania access to the EEC market for a wide range of clothing products
to be marketed at prices which may not raise charges of unfair competition
from the side of the textile industry of the countries affected by imports.
3/ In spite of this revision, the share of cellulosics in Romanian mill consump-
tion remain high in comparison to other countries (Table 5).



ANNEX 3-3
Page 4
9.        Production is projected to grow during the present Plan period at
a fast rate of 13.2% a year, which is nonetheless relatively low compared to
the growth rate targeted for the chemical sector as a whole (15.9% a year).
With production growing faster than mill consumption, the net total fiber trade
deficit will decrease moderately and fall from 105 to roughly 90 thousand tons
by 1980. The 1980-85 projections show on the contrary that, if no new man-made
fiber projects are implemented during the latter part of the decade, the net
total fiber deficit might more than double and reach about 160 thousand tons by
1985. In particular, the net surplus in synthetics of 24 thousand tons in 1980
would become a deficit of 50 thousand tons by 1985 out of which 19 thousand in
polyester, suggesting that there might be room for further investments in this
sector even after the projects included in the present Plan have been implemented.
However, all indications are that new projects will be designed and implemented
between 1980 and 1985 to cover all the needs for synthetic fibers and that only
cotton will be imported in significant quantities (over 100,000 tons)by 1985.
Projections of Polyester Fiber Production and Mill Consemption by Romania
10.       A breakdown by project and by fiber type (filament and staple) of
the projections for polyester fiber production and consumption is shown in
Table 6. The enterprises and projects taken into account include: (i) the
only polyester fiber plant existing to date, at Iasi, with a capacity of 9,000
TPY of filament and 42,700 TPY of staple; (ii) the proposed expansion project
for this plant with a capacity of 6,000 TPY of filament and 1,000 TPY in
staple; (iii) the proposed Cimpulung project, with a capacity of 31,450 TPY
of staple; and (iv) the proposed Vaslui project which would use polyester chips
produced in Cimpulung to product 12,000 TPY of filament yarn for apparel and
industrial uses. The breakdown between filament and staple of the total poly-
ester fiber mill consumption estimate has been based on a projected breakdown
for 1975-80 provided by the Romanians; the 1980 proportion between filament
and staple has been applied to subsequent years.
11.       The trade balance for polyester filament resulting from projected
production and mill consumption Tigures shows a continued deficit until the
Vaslui project comes on stream in 1980, followed by three years of small
surpluses and again thereafter by deficits, if no new projects are implemented
in the meantime. The trade surplus for polyester staple is expected to
decrease over the coming five years and become7a deficit in 1979. By 1980,
starting operations in Cimpulung will, however, reverse this situation, produc-
ing four years of surpluses (but lower than the present-polyester staple surplus)
followed by a return to a deficit situation between 1983 and 1984.
Market Forecast for the Project
12.       At full capacity, the Cimpulung Project will produce 10,500 TPY of
cotton-type staple, 800 TPY of wool-type staple, 5,150 TPY of wool-type tow, 5,000
TPY of wool-type tops, 10,000 TPY of flax-type staple and 15,200 TPY of polyester

chips (to be used in the Vaslui project).-/ The various staple products
(i.e. staple in the narrow sense, plus tow and tops) from the project will
temporarily result in exportable surpluses (Table 7) from 1980 through 1983.
By 1984 the project's output will entirely be substituting for imports. If
one takes into account the polyester chips production, the year by year
proportions of total project output (including chips) consisting of exportable
surplus are as follows:
ROMANIA: DESTINATION CF TOTAL PROJECT OUTPUT
(Percentages on a weight basis)
Exports         Import Substitution
1980                29%                  71%
1981                24%                  76%
1982                20%                  80%
1983                 6%                  94%
1984 and             0%                 100%
thereafter
Actual physical exports until 1983 are expected to consist of polyester
wool-type staple, tow and tops and only subsidiarily from polyester cotton-
type staple. Reaction to flax-type polyester staple in the international
markets is not well known and this type of product is intended mainly for
local mill consumption.
Projections of Romanian Home Consumption and Trade in Textiles and Clothing
-3.       Total fiber home consumption has been projected to grow fram 240
to 405 thousand tons, i.e. at 5.5% a year from 1975 through 1985, per capita
consumption reaching 16.9 Kg. by 1985_/ up from 11.2 Kg. in 1975 (Table 3).
This projection is based on a per capita elasticity of 0.75 (Annex 3-2, Table 7),
on Bank forecasts of an average 6-7% growth in the Rosnanian GDP over the next
10 years and on an assumed population growth of 1.2% per annum. Table 8 shows
that under these assumptions a net trade surplus of 52 thousand tons of clothing
and textiles in 1975 would increase to about 175 thousand tons over the decade,
attaining a 12.8% annual growth rate. Assuming that net exports to Developed
Countries would grow at an average 10% a year and that the share directed to
CCMECON countries will maintain itself at 50%, about 20% of the RQmanian's net
surplus would be exported to LDC, mainly Middle Eastern countries, whose markets
Romania has already begun to penetrate.
1/ The Vaslui project will cause a small trade surplus in polyester filament
between 1980 and 1982 (Table 6).
2/ By comparison, per capita consumption figures (in Kg.) for 1974 were the
following for various regions and countries: Developed Countries, 16.6
(down from 18.5 in 1973); USSR, 12.9, Eastern Europe except USSR, 14.3;
Bulgaria, 17.2; Czechoslovaki 16.4; German Republic, 21.9 (Source: FAO).

ROMANIA - CIYPULUNG MUSCEL-POLYESTER PROJECT
IARKETING ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE PROJECT
General Description
1.       The polyester staple, tow and tops production of the Cimpulung
Enterprise intended for use in Romania will be sold to the spinning
Enterprises under the Centrals for the Cotton Industry, the Wool Industry,
and the Silk, Flax and Hemp Industry, all in the Ministry of Light
Industries (Table). In these mills, the fibers will be blended with
natural or other man-made fibers into spun yarn, which will in turn be
supplied to: (i) the weaving mills under the Centrals mentioned above;
(ii) the knitting mills of the Central for Knitting Industry, also in the
Ministry of Light Industries; and (iii) for a small part directly to the
retail trade, in the Ministry of Internal Trade. Polyester staple, tow
and tops intended for exports will be sold by the Cimpulung Enterprise to
Danubiana, the foreign trade enterprise responsible, under the Ministry of
Chemical Industry, for the marketing of synthetic fibers abroad.
2.       The polyester chips to be produced by the Enterprise will be sold
to the future Vaslui plant which will be included in the Savinesti Central.
Vaslui in turn will supply most of its output, consisting of apparel-type
filament yarn to the knitting mills under the Ministry of Light Industries,
and the remainder, consisting of industrial filament yarn, to industrial
users under the Ministry of Chemical Industries and other innistries.
3.       The ministries, and under them the centrals, play an important
role in coordinating the activities and needs between the enterprises of
their own sector and those of other ministries and centrals. On the basis
of a consultation process which occurs both laterally between ministries
and centrals and vertically between the latter and their subordinated
enterprises, annual sales plans are drawn up at the various levels. The
actual sales contracts are nevertheless concluded by the enterprises them-
selves. Cimpulung Enterprise will for instance contract directly with
Danubiana, the Vaslui Enterprise and the spinning enterprises under the
Ministry of Light Industries. It cannot, however, alter its annual sales
plan, except in specific circumstances.
Polyester Fiber Marketing in Romania: Consumer Reactions and Feedback
4.      The locally consumed staple output of the project will be made
into yarn which will eventually be incorporated into fabrics, clothing
and knitted goods put out for sale to Romanian consumers and, for a
smaller part, for export. Past experience with regard to consumer accep-
tance of polyester blended textile goods in Romania has been good. In
Romania, pure cotton or flax products are 30%-50% more expensive than



ANNEX 3-h
Page 2
polyester blended productsl/ while rayon-based products are less cost
advantageous in view of their relatively lower performance in terms of
durability and shrink-resistance. Furthermore, an unusually large propor-
tion of women are employed (about 35% of employees of the staple sector
are women) and the easy-care characteristics of polyester blends are
particularly appreciated.
5.       The quality of the polyester blended fabrics is good by world
standards and many of them have stood the test of demanding export markets.
Some problems with dyeing have reportedly occured occasionally with poly-
ester and acrylic filaments but, according to Danubiana, no complaints have
been received in the recent past. The Romanians intend to develop the use
of polyester/flax blended fabrics in view of the considerable importance of
flax in Romania (Annex 3-3, Tables 1 and 4) as well as in some other Euro-
pean countries. Such blends combine the excellent characteristics of the
relatively expensive flax fiber with the lower density and finer appearance
of polyester. Since they also cost less than pure flax material, they are
expected to support rather than impede the demand for flax. These blends
are used for printed dresses, summer suits, bed linen, interior decoration,
and shirting materials.
6.       Consumer feedback plays an important role in the textile and cloth-
ing market in Romania and is taken into account in designing the product
mix of future projects, such as the Cimpulung Project, as well as in adjust-
ing to short-term changes in demand patterns. Consumer reactions are studied
on a continued basis by the Ministry of Internal Trade by such means as:
(i) statistical monitoring based on turnover and inventory data collected
from the retail channels; (ii) customer inter/ews and surveys in pilot
stores and general stores; (iii) sample fairs_ including questionnaires
regarding color and style preferences; (iv) invitations to customer groups
to visit factory showrooms; (v) meetings between trade representatives of
different regions and cities; and (vi) marketing studies performed by
specialized research institutes under the Ministries of Internal and
Foreign Trade.
Export Marketing of Polyester Fibers
7.       Danubiana, the Foreign Trade Enterprise which will handle tne
temporary exports of part of the polyester staple produced by the Cimpulung
Project (mainly wool-type staple, tow and tops) has extensive experience in
export marketing of synthetic fibers covering a large market including
Eastern and Western Europe, Canada, the USA and the Mid-East. It has until
recently competed mainly with branded fibers offered by large international
companies and has therefore sold abroad at an average 15% under the price
of the latter. With the weakening of brand promotion abroad and its own
efforts to strengthen customer loyalty, Danubiana is now able to compete at
prices only about 5% below those of unbranded polyester staple produced and
marketed by foreign multinationals.

ROMANIA - CIMPULUNG-MUSCEL POLYESTER PROJECT
D3SCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS
1.        Polyesters are the products of the polymerization of esters,
which, in turn, constitute a large group or organic compounds resulting
from the combination of organic acids and alcohols:
R-COOH + R1-OH                    2 R-CQD-R1+HO
Where, R and Rl are organical radicals. Until now, polyethylene tere-
phtalate (generally known in the textile industry as polyester or PES)
has been the most successful polyester for textile use.-  It can be
obtained by the reaction and polycondensation (polymerization) of pure
terephtalic.acid (TiA) and ethylene glycol (EG). It can also be obtained--
and this is the process to be used in the project--by first reacting
dimethyl terephtalate (DMT) and ethylene glycol in a "transesterification"
reaction in which the methyl and ethyl radicals are interchanged. This
reaction is followed by polymerization of the resulting bis-(2-hydroxy-
ethyl) terephtalate, commonly known as di-glycol terephtalate (DGT).
CH3-COO-C6H4hCOO0CH3 + 2CH20H'CH20H-/ e.
OH:C2H4hCOO C6H4COOOC2H4OH + 2CH3OH
(n+l)OH'C2HhCOO'C6H4OH - *-OH2H4O
OH'C2H4hCOO-C6H4'(COOC2H4O'COOC6H4)n'COOOC2H4OH
+ nOH C2Hh0OH
2.        The two main raw materials to be used in the manufacture of
polyester in the Cimpulung project are DMT and EG. DMT is made by
oxidation of para-xylene by air or nitric acid followed by esterification
with methanol:
CH30C6H4-CH3  + 302 -* COOHIC6H4oCOOH  +  2H20
COOH.C6Hh.COOH + 2CH30H -` CH3-COO.C6H4.COO.CH3 + 2H20
Ethylene glycol manufacture is based on the oxidation of ethylene and the
hydration of the resulting ethylene oxide:
C2H4 +     -.2 C2H4O
CO2Hh + H20 -g CH20H.CH20H
1/ polycyclo-hexane-dimethylene terephtalate or (-CH2-C6HlO1CH2O-CO-C6H4CO-)n
has been used in the US under the trade name "Kodel." 
2/ In practice since some polymerization occurs during transesterifica-
tion, the molar ratio of EG to DMT can be considerably lower than 2.



ANNEX 4-3
Page 2
3.        s'he process for the manufacture of PES based on DMT comprise
the followwing steps:
(a) Transportation and storage of raw materials. In the project,
it is proposed that DMT be transported as a melt (melting
poing of DMT: l1l4C) from the plant where it will be
produced at Pitesti at a distance of about 50 Km away from
Cimpulung on good paved roads. The molten material will be
kept in heated vessels.
(b) Preparation of DMT and EG. To carry out the reactions solid
DMT is dissolved in EM. When using molten DMT, it can be
mixed with hot glycol in an esterification vessel. Catalysts
and other additives are added to EG in agitated tanks (EG's
boiling point is 1950C).
(c) Transesterification. In this section the methyl and ethyl
radicals of DMT and EG respectively are interchanged in a
multiple-step operation in each of which temperature (150 -
200'C) is carefully controlled. Methanol, water and some
low-boiling compounds are drawn as overhead products from
the columns while glycol with small amounts of DMT and
di-glycol terephtalate are withdrawn as liquid bottoms.
Those bottoms are recycled to previous columns. The over-
head products are condensed and partly sent back to the
first column as reflux and the balance sent out to storage
tanks (in the same case of Cimpulung, for eventual transfer
to the DMT-producing plant at Pitesti). During transesteri-
fication, DGT is partially polymerized and oligomers with
"n" ranging between 0 and 4 are formed, depending on tempera-
ture, time, amount of excess glycol, if any, type and
quantity of catalyst, presence of titanium dioxide (TiO2),
equipment used, etc. The linear oligomers do not interfere
with the next step in the manufacture of PES, but during
transesterification, a small amount (1%-2%) of cyclic oli-
gomers are also formed.
(d) Polycondensation. The degree of polymerization has decisive
importance in he textile properties of the polyester obtained
and for different uses slightly different average value of "n"
may be sought. Several factors influence the polymerization
process, mainly temperature, time, pressure (vacuum), agita-
tion of the liquid, shape and type of vessels, and type and
concentration of catalysts. PES melts at 2609C and decomposes
at 290°C so that working temperatures are limited to a narrow
range. To avoid a low degree of polycondensation pressure
should be below atmospheric. Oxygen degrades the polymer so
that nitrogen atmosphere is used. Large contact surfaces in
the polymerization vessels and thin layers of the melt favor
higher viscosities in shorter reaction times. Polycondensa-
tion is carried out in several stages; the first stage is
sometimes referred to as the pre-polycondensation stage.



AV'2X 4-3
Page 3
(e) De-lustering. To obtain an appropriate capacity and
surface appearance,a suspension of TiO2 in EG is added at
a carefully measured rate proportional to the flow of the
main materials. This can be done between stages of the
polycondensation process. The TiO2 used must be extremely
fine (less than 1.5 millionth of a millimeter in diameter).
Filtration is needed to separate any agglomerated particles.
(f) Handling of the Polymer. Thermal instability of PES makes
rapid conversion of the melt into a solid, a most important
step. The vessels are discharged either by nitrogen pressure
or by means of a heated booster pump and then it is extruded
into bars or rods (for PES chips) or into filaments (through
spinnerets).
(g) Chopping into chips. Chips are then dried and a certain
degree of crystallization takes place according to the
temperature.
(h) Direct Spinning. Spinning can be carried out starting with
chips from other plants. In the Cimpulung project direct
spinning will be employed, where the melt discharged from
the reactors is thoroughly mixed and distributed through the
spinnerets. The pumps and spinnerets are mounted on heated
spinning heads. The rate of flow is carefully controlled
individually through each spinneret. The orifices in the
spinnerets are precisely shaped and dimensioned (they are
frequently tapered and the final diameter is less than 1 mm)
to ensure that the filaments produced have the exact cross-
section desired. The filaments are quenched by means of an
air blast. Pumps are high precision made of special steels.
Either metering gear pumps or pressure pumps followed by
measuring pumps are generally used. The pumps are at present
generally driven by electric drives.
(i) Fiber drawing. Filaments leaving the spinnerets and quenching
ducts are moistened, finishing materials are applied to them
and drawn off in bundles by means of godets. The bundles are
joined to form a tow, which may be subjected to further
moistening and then filled into cans. During drawing, the
filaments are stretched several times in length.
(j) Crimping and Cutting. The tow is delivered from the cans to
the fiber lines where the fibers are dried, heat-set and
sprayed with antistatic and lubricating liquids, before being
crimped. The degree of crimp given to the fibers is regulated
by the temperature, which must be above the rubber-glass
transition point at about 80JC. It can also be controlled
by variation in the pressure applied at the rollers. After
drying the tow is either sold as such or sent to the staple



ANTEX 4-3
Page a
fiber cutters. The staple is finally baled, generally in
a double-box type baling press. Then, the staple is sent
to spinning mills to be spun, alone or blended with
natural or other man-made fibers.
4.        In addition to the processing steps described above, a polyester
plant requires electric energy, steam at various pressures and temperatives,
cooling water, chilled water, demineralized or distilled water, softened
water, compressed air, and nitrogen. All of these utilities must be
reliably available on a continuous way. Stoppages or fluctuations in
their supply may occasion great losses in materials and products or lengthy
interruptions of the entire plant's production. A circulating heat transfer
medium (such as dyphenyl oxide) is generally used to ensure closely controllk.d
temperature and heat transfer flows to the polymerization vessels and may
also be used to heat other equipment.
5.        The process flows of materials and energy are measured and
controlled continuously by means of automated systems in which the variables
interact and feed back to assure an optimum combination of conditions.
6.        Waste glycol (containing some water, PES, oligomers, DMT and
methanol) and impure methanol are collected for reuse in the same plant
or resale to other chemical plants; solid waste is recovered for manufac-
ture of hessian cloth or for depolymerization; some of the waste must be
destroyed.

ANNEX 7-2
ROMANIA: CIMPULUNGi-MUCEL POLYESTER PROJECT
ASSUMPTIONS MADE FOR THE ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS AND ANALYSIS
Basis for Projection
1.        Constant 1976 dollars have been used, based on an implicit 7%
general inflation rate and an assumed capital cost escalation of 9% in
1977, 8% in 1978, and 7% thereafter for both foreign and local fixed
capital costs.  (Although a lower price escalation fa7  r has been used
for the latter in the financial capital cost estimate shown in Annex 5-1,
this does not imply that their economic value does not increase in parallel
with the value of similar capital items produced abroad, at least as far
as tradeable equipment and materials are concerned).
Exchange Rates
2.        For calculating the economic benefits and costs, international
prices have been used for imported equipment and materials, and the
project's outputs and tradable inputs. Local equipment and civil works,
most inventory components, labor and overhead have been valued at local
prices and translated at the official trading rate of 20 Lei per $ norvally
used by the Bank in project appraisals. Sensitivity analysis has been
conducted on the exchange rate.
Capital obsts
3.        Capital costs used in the economic projections are as shown in
Annex 5-1 except for what has been said above on the treatment of price
contingencies (para 1).
Product Mix and Build-up Schedule
4.        The product mix is as shown in Annex 6-1 and the expected
production build-up is of 60% in 1977, 80% in 1978 and 100% in 1979. To
allow for the possibility of switching production lines to produce more
or less of each type of staple in response to changes in needs, the
economic prices of each have been conservatively equalized (although flax-
and wool-type staple could in the long run command a higher price than
cotton-type staple, since they substitute for more expensive fibers).
Economic Prices for Polyester
5.        The economic price for polyester staple has been projected to
gradually increase from presently depressed prices to the long-term



ANNEX 7-2
Page 2
equilibrium price of US075 per pound by 1983 (Annex 3-2, para 29).  These
prices have been used as the basic price for all polyester products to be
produced at CIMPULUNG by applying the following spreads:
Index
Polyester Staple (all types)              100
Polyester Tow                             110
Polyester Tops                            130
Polyester Chips                            70
These spreads are based on historical prices and differences in processing
cost and demand factors and are not expected to change subotantially.
Border Prices
6.        All of the project's output, except temporarily wool-type polyester,
will substitute for imports. Since the price for staple used as the basis
for economic fiber and chip prices (see above) is already a CIF Common
Market price, no adjustment had to be made to credit the project with the
CIF-FOB differential. In the case of the wool-type tow directed towards
export markets, the following adjustments were made to the economic
price:
(i)  A 2% charge was deducted from the economic Price (CIF
based) to reflect the CIF-FOB differential.
(ii)   Furthermore, it was assumed that Romania would have to
sell at a discount of 5% below the price of unbranded
staple of Western European origin. The magnitude of
this discount was estimated during discussions with
Danubiana, the Romanian import-export trading company
responsible for the export marketing of synthetic
fibers.
For methanol, a US$15 per ton credit was given above the US$100 ton FOB
Middle-East price (Romania imports methanol from this area of the world).
Raw Material Costs
7.        MTY requirements were derived after applying a technical coefficient
of 1.072 per ton of polyester and allowing for the recovered amount. The
present price of DMT is of US¢24 per pound in Western Europe. This is 2¢
higher than the equivalent cost of TPA (pure terephtalic acid) after adjustment
for the latter's more favorable usage ratio. Since the TPA technology is
increasingly used as an alternative to the DMT process to produce PES, it is



ANNEX 7-2
believed that the economic price of DMT will gradually decline to match the
cost of using TPA. To be conservative, MgT was nevertheless given an
economic price of US¢24 per pound.
8.        ED was valued at its present Weatern European price of US021
per pound over the project life, an assumption considered conservative
given the expectations for significant surpluses in Western Europe during
the coming decade. Other raw materials were valued according to Romanian
estimates at US$1.4 million, including catalysts, stabilizators, delustrants
and materiala for finishing and packing. The Romanian estimate is in line
with estimates obtained from specialized consultants.
Utilities
9.        The total power demand of 100 million KWh will be supplied
partly (6h million KWh) by an in-plant 8 MW thermo-power station, and
the remainder (L0 million KWh) is to be purchased from the national grid.
Fuel consumption, estimated at 40,000 TPY (including both power and steam
generation), was valued at an economic price of $65 per ton.
Labor Costs
10.       Manpower needs in the project amount to 2,135 people which is
2-3 times the number required by similar plants in Developed Countries.
This differential is largely a result of Romanian employment policies
and should not be entirely debited in economic terms to the project in
the economic analysis. To be conservative, the entire payroll was never-
theless used as labor costs in this analysis. As far as competitiveness
is concerned, it is absolutely unlikely that the low productivity of
labor in Cimpulung enterprise could have any significant impact since
Romanian labor costs run far below labor costs in Developed Countries
(Annex 6-1) and in any case, represent less than 5% of production costs,
including depreciation.
Maintenance
11.       This item includes only supplies and parts, since maintenance
labor has been included above.
Project Life and Terminal Value
12.       Project life was conservatively estimated at 15 years, including
two years of production build-up. Spinning and drawing facilities,
properly maintained, could actually serve through a much longer period
of time. No terminal value was credited to the Project except for a
notional working capital recovery.
