MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED CREDIT TO
THE REPUBLIC OF BURUNDI FOR A
POPULATION AND HEALTH PROJECT
1.       The following report on a proposed development credit to Burundi
for SDR 11 million (US$14.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval.
The proposed credit would be on standard IDA terms with a maturity of 40
years to help finance a Population and Health Project. The project would be
cofinanced by UNICEF for US$1.8 million.
2.       Background.  With a population density of 180 per km2, Burundi is
the second most densely populated country in Africa, after Rwanda. The
present population is 4.9 million (95% of which is rural) and will double !a
23 years at the present growth rate of about 3% per year. The Government,
aware that rapid population growth is one of the most threatening
con-traints to economic development, adopted a policy of population control
in 1983, and launched an intensive information campaign. Even the
influential Catholic church has accepted the need for planned parenthood
through natural methods. Present contraceptive prevalence is estimated at
1.6% (1% in rural areas and 3% in urban areas). To reduce the population
growth rate to 2% (assuming a constant mortality decline), the contraceptive
prevalence rate should reach 33% by the year 2000--a target which requires
massive family planning (FP) efforts.  The hi,h under-five child mortality
rate (nearly 20%) and the high fertility rate (about 6.2 children per woman)
could be reduced by standard Liaternal and child health (MCH) services if
they were fully available. While health/nutrition status 4s poor (life
expectancy at birth is 47 years), they are similar to those previalent in
Eastern Africa. Mortality might rise in the next years due to the spread of
Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) which is already highly prevalent
in urban areas. Whereas physical access to health care is relatively wood
by Sub-Saharan African standards (65% of the population lives within 5Km of
a health facility; but, due to the mountainous terrain, accessibility
varies), availability of primary health care (PHC) services is still too low
to have a major impact on mortality, morbidity, or fertility. This is
mostly due to: (a) the lack of comprehensive national MCH policies and
programs (including FP and nutrition) which would target the activities to
the most vulnerable groups (under-five children, pregnant and lactating
women); (b) the absence of a structured information, education, and
communication (IEC) program; (c) the institutional weakness of the Ministry
of Health (MOH); and (d) the lack of financing to expand health activities.



-2-
3.       Prolect Obiectives.  The overall objectives are to:  (a) contribute
to the reduction of maternal and child morbidity and mortality; (b) promote
and develop birth spacing and family planning among couples; (c) contribute
tc AIDS control; (d) improve the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the
health system; and (e) improve the national population database. The
project objectives are fully consistent with key government objectives to be
reached by the end of the fifth Five-Year Development Plan (1988-92): (a)
reducing maternal mortality by 20%; (b) reducing infant mortality from 125
per 1000 to 100 per 1000; and (c) increasing contraceptive prevalence from
1.6% to 14%. These objectives are ambitious for a five-year period and will
require a strong commitment from the Government and major efforts from the
donor community. The proposed project is considered by the Government to be
a key element of its strategy toward the achievement of proposed objectives,
and IDA involvement in the sector is likely to stimulate both continuous
Government cemmitment and other donor collaboration.
4.       Project Description.  The proposed project has five components
which would address the above objectives by: (a) strengtheninx MCH and FP
services nationwide through (i) the establishment of a national MCH/FP
program and an MCH/FP Division in the Department of Hygiene and Prevention
to manage program implementation, (ii) additional staff for health centers
(HCs) and technical assistance to the MCH/FP Division, (iii) improvement in
medical supplies, including contraceptives, (iv) rehabilitation of 30 health
centers (HCs), (v) creation of three regional maintenance workshops, (vi)
additional vehicles for supervision, and (vii) monitoring and evaluation;
(b) developing a national IEC program through (i) the strengthening of the
MOH education division with additional staff, technical assistance,
equipment, and vehicles, (ii) the development of IEC material- for the
media, schools, and social sector personnel, (iii) the trai .-ng of health
staff and social workers, and (iv) supervision and evaluation; (c)
contributing to the National AIDS Control Program, through (i) health staff
training, (ii) health education materials development, (iii) provision of
medical supplies (including condoms) and laboratory equipment, and (iv)
research and evaluation; (d) developing the MOH institutional capability
through (i) the strengthening of key units, including the planning bvreau
and the health statistics unit, (ii) the development of management systems,
and (iii) the development of new finauicing mechanisms and better resource
allocation schemes for the health sector; and (e) population data
development through (i) financing of temporary staff recruited by the
Population Department to carry out the population census, (ii) development
of census materials, and (iii) funding of seminars to disseminate population
data. The health components will be implemented by existing MOH
departments, divisions, and units under the overall guidance of the
Inspection and Planning Bureau which responds directly to the Minister of
Health. The population component will be implemented by the Population
Department of the Ministry of Interior in close collaboration with the
Inspection and Planning Bureau. The project, to be carried out over five-
and-one-half years provides funds for civil works, furniture, equipment,
materials, vehicles, training, technical assistance, studies, research,
evaluation, and incremental recurrent costs. The total cost of the project
is estimated at US$18.7 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component
of US$10.5 million (56.0%). A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are
shown in Schedule A. Amounts and methods of procurement and of
disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are shown in Schedule B. Bank

Group operations in Burundi are given in Schedules C and D, respectively.
Maps are attached. The Staff Appraisal Report, No. 6829-BU dated
November 16, 1987 is also attached.
5.       Rationale for IDA Involvement.  Long-term IDA strategy in Burundi
places emphasis on creating an adequate economic ar.d social framework for
sustainable growth for which the development of human resources is
essential. In the short-term, IDA is supporting a structural adjustment
program which emphasizes population and nutrition factors and provides for a
review of publ;c expenditures, including health expenditures. Thus, IDA
involvement in the PHN sectors is consistent with overall IDA strategy. It
would support Government programs to control population growth, increase
health covetage, and improve f4nancing and efficiency of health services
while strengthening institutions responsible for these services. The
proposed project is a result of an in-depth dialogue with the Government
leading to agreements on major sectoral policies and strategies. In this
context, the project would also serve as a catalvst for other aid in the
sector and contribute to overall donor coordination.
6.       Agreed Actions.  The following actions would be taken by the
Government: (a) recrvitment of four additional nurses for every HC to be
rehabilitated under the project; (b) appointment of lI additional provincial
public health supervisors; (c) submission for IDA review and comment of a
National AIDS Control Program, and agreement on th's program as a condition
of disbursement for AIDS activities; (d) appointment of the Director of the
Health Education Division (SDEPS) and two deputies; (e) submission for IDA
review and comment of a health financing policy paper and a proposal to
implement the recommendations; (f) submission for IDA review and comment of
the Census Master Plan, and agreement on this Plan as a condition of
disbursement for census activities; (g) submission for IDA review and
comment of a Plan of Action for developing jointly the civil registration
and vital statistics systems; (h) submission for IDA review of yearly audit
reports; (i) acquisition of all HC sites by June 30, 1988; (j) appointment
of a full-time dep.ity project coordinator by January 1, 1990; (k) submission
for IDA review and comment of the annual project implementation plan; (1)
annual project performance re"iew, including project management; and (m)
yearly discussion and revision with IDA of a 3-year rolling PIP/PEP.
7.  Justification.  The project would have the following eirect benefits:
(a) approximately one million people living in under-served areas would have
access to a full range of essential PHC services; (b) nearly one million
women of childbearing age would have access to cffective maternal care and
family planning methods; (c) about 800,000 under-five children would benefit
from an effective MCH service package, including nutrition activities; (d)
the National AIDS Control Program would be established; (e) the MOH would
benefit from institutional strengthening; (f) new sources of health
financing would be developed; and (g) the population database would be
developed and integrated into the national planning progress. In addition,
the project would address one cf the major constraints to the country's
economic development: the high population growth rate. The project would
contribute to a contraceptive prevalence target of 14% by 1992, setting in
motion a process that would gain momentum and lead to a significant
fertility reduction by the year 2000 (from an approximate TFR of 6.1 in 1987



-4-
to 4.1 by 2000). In the long run, a steady decrease in the growth rate
would have sizeable impact on the populati,.n size (9 million against 12
million by 2015), and alleviate pressures on the social and productive
sectors.
8.       Risks.  The main risk relates to the MOH inexperience in
implementing a project of this size. MOH administrative capability is
limited at both central and peripheral levels, and may lead to subsequent
operating delays. The project is designed to address this risk by
distributing the implementation responsibilities among various MOH units to
be strengthened under the project by addtional staff ar.d technical
assistance. At the peripheral level, the envisaged extensive in-service
training and intensified supervision should minimize the potential
management shortcomings. Ultimately, Government's commitment, as already
demonstrated by the thorough project preparation, would be an important
risk-reducing factor. A second risk concerns potential operational problems
during the execution of the proposed population census--an inherently
complex operation. However, the fact that the Population Department has
already carried out successfully the 1t179 census is a strong asset. In
addition, technical assistance will be available from several donors,
including IDA. The third risk concerns the implementation of the first IDA-
supported National AIDS Control Program. At the moment, there are no
definite standards, guidelines, or models to develop an effective package of
AIDS control activities, particularly since the epidemiological
characteristics of the disease in Africa are still unclear. However,
Burundi will benefit from worldwide efforts to control the disease and
overall technical guidance of the WHO special program.
9.       Recommendations.  I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the Association and recommend that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.
