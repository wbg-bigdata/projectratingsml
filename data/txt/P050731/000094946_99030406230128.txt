A. Project Development Objective
1. Project development ubjective and key performance indicators
The project objective is to test a performance-based capacity-building progran methodology that will
contribute to transforming Credit Rural, Credit Mutuel, and Le Programrne Integre pour le Developpement
de I'Entreprise (PRIDE) from donor-financed development projects into sustainable financial institutions
that are appropriately regulated by the Central Bankl of Guinea.
Methodology being tested
Commonly, microfinance activities are supported as socially oriented donor-financed projects regardless of
performance. Each of Guinea's microfinance institutions has been supported by technical assistance
projects for the past 9 to 10 years, and progress in the areas of capacity building and institutional self-
sufficiency has been less than desirable. The World Bank has been asked by the government and other
donors to introduce a new approach.
The proposed project pilots an approach to support implementation of the Africa Region Strategyfor the
Development ofMicro, Rural, and Small Enterprise Finance. The strategy takes a financial systems
approach to developing well-performing institutions that can sustainably provide financial services to low-
income client groups as an integral part of countries' financial sectors. Instead of providing ongoing
subsidies to microfinance activities whatever their performance, the proposed performance-based format
establishes standards of performance that the institutions must achieve to be eligible for continued project
financing. The methodology is modeled on the one developed by the Consultative Group to Assist the
Poorest (CGAP). The innovation to be tested is how to adapt the grant-based CGAP methodology to loan-
based project funding, which is subject to the World Bank's procurement guidelines and procedures.
The proposed project gives us an opportunity to experiment with use of
-  An apex arrangement within the Central Bank that is responsible for developing the capacity of
microfinance institutions by coordinating and managing project inputs, monitoring the institutions'
performance, and developing an appropriate microfinance regulatory and supervisory framework
*  The development of performance standards and benchmarksfor microfinance institutions, making the
achievement of progressively more ambitious targets the eligibility criteria for continued access to
project funding
* The explicit tying of technical assistance contracts to the achievement of specific institutional
development targets and to specific capacity-building plans for the staff of microfinance institutions
and the communities they serve
*  The establishment of institutional contracts with agreed annual performance targets and clear exit
strategies-the cessation of the institution's funding, in cases where contractual targets are not
achieved for two years in a row.
A base of Bank and donor funds provides ongoing training, advisory, and other institution-building
assistance. Additional funding, however, is contingent on the perforrnance of Credit Rural, Credit Mutuel,
and PRIDE with respect to institution-specific indicators that will be monitored biannually. Three or four
indicators, which focus on areas of special concern for each institution, will be chosen for setting
performance targets-"deal breakers"-the achievement of which will determine whether annually agreed
incentive funding established for each institution will be disbursed. The two long-term advisory contracts
will be broken into a fixed and a variable component (30%) of the contract's negotiated value. The variable



Page 3
component will be tied to achievement of the institution's performance indicators and to staff training, skills
development, and systems development targets.
Annual performai ce standards for each institution (Annexes 4A through 4D) have been developed for key
indicators such as those found below, and three or four "deal breakers"' will be chosen during the
contracting process.

Scaling-up strategy
Guinea, with its diverse base of microfinance institutions, gives us ani opportunity top
*  Test a methodology that can be scaled up for future support to Guinea's microfinancc institutions.
Experience in Africa indicates that microfinance institutions take 15 to 20 years to become financially
self-sustaining. If successful, the approach will be scaled up for future support to these institutions in
the Financial and Private Sector Development Project, which is envisaged in International Development
Association's (IDA) FY2001 lending program for Guinea.
*  Field test a methodology that, if successful, can le applied in other countries and institutional contexts
to support the development of sound microfinance institutions and to build microfinance skills among
indigenous staff. The methodology will be tested on a credit union type of institutional structure that
requires substantial rehabilitation (Cr6dit Mutuel), a rural commnunity-based credit scheme (Credit
Rural), and a traditional microfinance nongovernmental organization (PRIDE), thereby giving us a
range of lessons learned that can be applied to appropriate institutional contexts.

Choice of a LIL lending instrument
The project will be prepared as a Learning and Innovation Loan (LIL) because the program's objectives are
of a pilot and experimental nature. The LIL project format was chosen over the traditional fully designed
blue-print format to
* Test a performance-based program that retains management flexibility in the ongoing process of
developing self-sustainability among relatively weak, but high-potential, microfinance institutions that
may or may not achieve the performance indicators necessary for disbursement
* Test government's commitment to develop a regulatory, legal, and contract enforcement framework for
microfinance development and the institutions' commitrnent to achieve standards of performance
necessary for sustainability.
The lessons learned during implementation and experimentation under the project will be incorporated into
the design of the follow-on Financial and Private Sector Development Project.
B. Strategic Context
1. Sector-related Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) goa! supported by the project
CAS document number: 171 83-GUI    Date of latest CAS discussion: December 16, 1997
The government's national development strategy for the CAS period reflects the strategic priorities that
were developed on the basis of consultation with nearly 3,500 beneficiaries and stakeholders from civil
society, village communities, and women's groups throughout the country. The process culminated in a
National Consultative Forum in Conakry during which participants ranked rural development as one of
their highest priorities-especially the development of rural infrastructure and credit services-and the
development of local entrepreneurship among microenterprises and small and medium enterprises (SMEs).
A principal goal of the CAS is to stimulate economic growth and diversification by providing financial
services to agriculture, rural areas, and the informal and microenterprise sector. The proposed project
supports this goal by strengthening specialized microfinance institutions, expanding their outreach, and
integrating them into Guinea's financial fabric as sustainable institutions for serving low-income
populations.
The project is arnong the first in Africa designed to implement the Africa Region Strategy for the
Development ofMicro, Rural, and Small Enterprise Finance. This strategy
*  Identifies the development of an appropriate regulatory framework as an essential prerequisite for the
evolution of sound microfinance institutions
*  Focuses on capacity-building (training, specialized technical assistance) and performance-based
funding as mechanisms for developing high-performing retail intermediaries capable of serving groups
that otherwise would have no access to financial services.
The microfinance strategy is an integral part of the overall financial sector development strategy for the
region. It takes a fuiancial systems approach to developing rural and microfinance institutions. The goal is
to ensure that diversi fiedfinancial sectors are capable of serving the diverse savings and credit needs of
a range of groups, including the rural and urban poor and the self-employed.

2. Background on the sector
Informal economic activities
Guinea is one of most infornalized economies in the world. From 1958 to 1984, the Sekou Toure
government pursued a centrally planned model of economic development that gave birth to a large and
dynamic parallel economy. At least two-thirds of the economically active population are employed in
informal activities. In 1988, informal activities contributed close to 62 percent of the country's gross
domestic product (GDP). From 1980 to 1992, employment in informal enterprises grew at an annual rate of
2.6 percent (the same as average annual population growth). Informal activities' contribution to GDP grew
about 3 percent annually from 1987 to 1993. Given the sectoral distribution of the economy-two-thirds of
the economically active population are involved in agriculture-most informal enterlprises are found in
rural areas, and agriculture is one component of a household's overal'I enterprise.
The reform program of late 1985 brought extensive public sector layoffs. As a result, registered
unemployment in Conakry increased threefold to 15,000 between 1985 and 1990. Civil servant salaries in
Guinea are low-40 percent less than those of their colleagues in Togo and 20 percent less than civil
service salaries in the Cte d'Ivoire. Because their government salaries are low, it is likely that many civil
servants supplement their income by operating informal enterprises.
The Sekou Toure regime created and operated a multitude of mutualist-type groups to support
microenterprises. Although these organizations never prospered, the inutualist philosophy of group- and
community-based affinity and guarantee mechanisms found its way ilto the development of three of
Africa's largest microfinance programs: Credit Rural, Credit Mutuel, and PRIDE.
Financial services for informal and rural enterprises
Commercial banks in Guinea have been very reluctant to enter retail finance markets. Disincentives to lend
domestically include lack of proper land registration titles as the basis for collateral, inability to enforce
contract rights through foreclosure, low literacy rates among the majority of the population, and the
inability to generate accounts on which to base bank loans. Today, only Banque Indlustrielle et
Commerciale de Guinee (BICIGUI) has a national branch network-with only 10 branches-end those
branches lend mostly short-term commercial credit for commodity imriports by large, well-known traders.
Term lending for investment is limited.
Given this background, the decentralized system of microfinance prograns plays an essential role in
providing financial services to the majority of the population, 80 percent of whom are rural, poor, and
unbankable through traditional commercial bank channels.
Institutional framework for microfinance
Guinea is home to three of Africa's largest microfinance institutions. Credit Mutuel now serves over
50,000 savers and borrowers. Credit Rural serves more than 53,000 savers and borrowers, and PRIDE
(which does not take savings) has about 9,000 microloans outstanding (1996 data).
The institutions' focus on different clienteles ensures appropriate financial services for
*  The agricultural sector and the rural poor (Credit Rural)
* Women-owned informal activities and enterprises (PRIDE) and
* Small businessmen, traders, and civil servants (Credit Mutuel).

3. Main sector issues and government strategy
Constraints in the regulatory and legal environment
Recognizing the dramatic growth of decentralized microfinance programs and the need to safeguard savers,
Guinea's banking law (Loi Bancaire 046/PRG85) was updated in February 1997 with Instruction no.
1/97/94 (Portant Reglementation des Institutions Financieres Specialisdes) to govern the activities of
microfinance institutions. The law has not yet been enforced, and the Central Bank is in the process of
considering options for the development of a sound regulatory framework for such institutions. On the
positive side, the current regulatory framework does not apply usury ceilings to microfinance
institutions-thereby allowing them the freedom to set cost recovery interest rates. Similarly, there are no
restrictions on the use of external lines of credit.
The major weakness of the law governing specialized financial institutions is its failure to distinguish
between a range of organizational and operational characteristics of microfinance institutions and the
resulting thresholds for regulation. As a result, the law assumes that all types of microfinance institutions
need to be regulated by a supervisory authority regardless of whether they take savings. It sets a minimum
capital of US$1.0 million equivalent and requires the maintenance of a 20 percent capital adequacy
requirement-an unrealistically high standard for microfinance institutions and for credit unions. No
reporting requirements, inspection procedures, sanctions, or penalties for noncompliance are specified,
making the law basically ineffective. Very importantly, the Central Bank does not currently have the
capacity to supervise these institutions.
The framework proposed by the project identifies the range of possible types of microfinance institutions
based on differences in the liabilities side of their balance sheets, which reflects the risk posed by the
institutions' operations to those who fund them-equity holders, savers, or nonvulnerable groups such as
donors. The framework takes the approach that the strictest forms of licensing, regulation, and supervision
should be reserved for those institutions where potential failure would pose the greatest fiscal risk and risk
to depositors (commercial and mutual banks).



Page 7
It would be recommended, for example, that nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and deposit-taking
NGO and microfinance institutions with limited loan guarantee-oriented deposits (such as PRIDE) be
excluded from external regulation by the Central Bank. Instead, they will be subject to the monitoring of
performance standards and a code of conduct established by a self-regulatory organization such as a
network of microfinance institutions. Credit-union-type deposit-taking institutions, such as Credit Rural
and Credit Mutuel, typically rely on monitoring by affiliated member-owners and on intemal audits and
inspections by a credit union federation or even by the Central Bank. This graduated approach to regulation
places high priority on the need to improve intemal controls and inspection processes within the institutions
themselves.
The judicial and legal system does not support delinquency management, which is at the heart of
successful microfinance development. Management of the credit approval and follow-up process is the
front-line defense against delinquency, and these processes must be greatly strengthened at Credit Mutuel
and PRIDE, especially. However, Guinea's judicial and legal enviromnent does not support or reinforce the
loan collection process. The police, the courts, and the gendarmerie, to the contrary, seem to support those
who do not repay their loans or who embezzle funds. Microfinance institution officials, who have been
persistent in collecting overdue loans, have been jailed.
Tlhe Labor Code applies the sarne salary and employment conditions to microfinance institutions as apply
to commercial banks (Banking Convention). Also, in its effort to protect workers, the Labor Code makes it
difficult to implement an incentive pay scheme in which incentives are tied to the size and results of a loan
officer's loan portfolio (Credit Rural), restricts the iiring of staff who have been directly implicated in
embezzlement (Credit Mutuel), and severely constrains an institution's ability to redeploy and fire staff as
it restructures its operations (Credit Mutuel). In the case of Credit Mutuel, the ability to redeploy and fire
staff during restructuring is critical to viability. In the case of all the institutions, the ability to maintain
cost-effectiveness through salary levels that are closely tied to key institutional results-such as volume of
loans managed and ability to maintain delinquency at low levels-is essential to profitability.
Institutional issues
Credit Mutuel de Guinee (CMG). The largest of the three programs, CMG is bankrupt and has suffered
substantially from theft, late repayment, and losses. The losses occurred largely as a result of an expansion
process that was not matched by appropriate internal controls and that stalled the development of savings-
based mutualist loan guarantee processes. CMG has suffered severely from external factors as follows:
*  The unsupervised placement of a large team of long-term technical advisors in line management
positions, who for nine years failed to train local staff, failed to develop control systems, and under
whose management CMG became bankrupt.
*  Inadequate financial support to cover start-up costs and operating deficits. Unlike Credit Rural, Credit
Mutuel has never received more than partial operating subsidies that were totally inadequate for a start-
up institution providing financial services to the poor. This has been a major factor contributing to its
decapitalization and developing liquidity crisis.
*  An uncontrolled expansion of new caisses into rural areas based, on donor lines of credit and grants
(including from the World Bank), which greatly increased its costs and problerns of inspection and
internal control. The result was significant embezzlement and a dramatic deterioration in the quality of
the portfolio.
Credit Mutuel's liquidity crisis is expected to become critical by August / September of 1998. To save
Credit Mutuel, a recapitalization of US$8.0 million would be required by December 1998, and smaller
amounts would be required as early as April 1998.



Page 8
A preliminary evaluation of Credit Mutuel and several initiatives already undertaken indicate that there is
hope for its recovery. A program of audits, inspections, enhanced internal controls, and the firing of guilty
staff should adequately address the problem of embezzlement-a major factor contributing to its large
annual losses. An active staff training program is under way. Despite the very high proportion of arrears
(50 percent), the amount at risk is nearly completely provisioned. Most important, despite rumors about its
solvency, the public continues to trust their savings to Credit Mutuel rather than to commercial banks.
Based on these positive prospects, the World Bank has developed with the government and the Caisse
Francaise de Developpement terms of reference for a viability study that will develop a restructuring plan
for Credit Mutuel. That study will be completed by mid-June.
Credit Rural de Guinee (CRG). After detailed analysis, Credit Rural is evaluated to be a good program
with significant potential for growth and future sustainability. It has good information, accountability, and
inspection systems, especially at the central level. Staff is well trained, and procedure manuals have been
developed and are used to ensure standard operation of the decentralized system. The principal challenges
facing CRG are:
*  Its mutualization processes and ownership at the local level are not complete. Mutualization whereby
members of each caisse feel strong ownership, responsibility, and commitment to improve the services
provided by the caisse is notably strong in about half of the system and notably quite weak in the other
half. The strongest caisses have managed delinquency and a healthy expansion process through a
system of Comites de Surveillance and Comites de Gestion comprised of elected leaders who play a
leading role in selecting clients to receive loans, collecting bad debts, and overseeing the caisses'
management. A healthy balance between the role of these citizen-elected corrmittees and the salaried
caisse agents is a key factor in the caisses' financial health, given the impact of delinquency and
portfolio growth on financial self-sufficiency.
X  Credit policy is set at the central levelfor the entire system, which stifles the appropriate desire of
stronger caisses and the communities they serve to have moreflexibility to manage their own affairs,
including some flexibility in developing an alternative set of standard loan and savings products that
better suit the needs of their existing and potential clients.
*  Each caisse must be managed as a profit center. This shift must be developed with intensive training
for management, agents, and clients in the community. Specifically, it is recommended that local
caisses (a) develop the capacity to prepare their own monthly accounts to allow managers and elected
community members to monitor and manage caisse performance and (b) develop cost accounting and
management information systems that include the costs of headquarters and regional delegations and
the calculation of delinquency on a portfolio-at-risk basis to reflect more properly the health of the
portfolio and overall financial performance. To ensure long-term sustainability in the communities it
serves, CRG caisses will have to develop attractive savings instruments and develop a process of
raising "social capital" (shares) to engender a true sense of ownership and a sense that something is at
risk if the caisse fails.
PRIDE. Among the microfinance programs, PRIDE is the only one that offers a high-quality
entrepreneurship training program that is highly valued by clients. The cost of providing these training
services, however, has been an important drag on PRIDE's achievement of financial self-sufficiency.
Recognizing the importance of achieving self-sufficiency, PRIDE has created two separate NGOs: PRIDE /
Finances (financial activities) and PRIDE / Guinea (training activities).
During the past'year, arrears at PRIDE rose dramatically to 25 percent of the portfolio, and the program
suffered from embezzlement and fraud by senior staff. Further the loan portfolio has been stagnant in
recent years apparently due to the failure to create interesting loan products for a large potential clientele.
Loan officer productivity is low, operating costs are high (64 percent of the loan portfolio), and the



Page 9
centralized process for loan approval is intfficient. PRIDE's financial reporting and portfolio tracking
systems are inadequate, and its loan methodology is weak and probably will not support the rapid growth
required to achieve sustainability. Specifically, there is a need to increase the productivity of loan agents,
improve accountability of agents for the performance of their loan portfolios, develop more decentralized
Joan approval and follow-up procedures, and create more attractive loan products based on client feedback.
Government strategy
Addressing Rolicy and regulatory issues. The government's strategy for addressing these issues is contained
in its Statement of Policies to Support Microfinance Development. The Statement of Policies, which was
discussed, agreed, and endorsed by the government during negotiations, reiterates the core principles
necessary for sustainable microfinance development that will be supported under the project. That is
* The importance of fostering ownership, management, and control of local caisses by the communities
they serve and the importance of developing a flexible staff management process, as a special policy
under the Labor Code, to ensure the performance of salaried agents
*  Government's commitment to ensure effective contract enforcement to allow institutions to reduce loan
delinquency and to ensure timely repayment of loans. The statement establishes a policy of zero-
tolerance for corruption and political interference in contract enforcement processes necessary to
ensure the repayment of loans. In such cases, the Ministry of Justice has made a commitment to
become directly involved in collaboration with the project. The Ministry of Justice has organized a
commnission consisting of banks' managing directors, and other private sector representatives who are
developing an action plan to improve the judicial and legal systern's capacity to support private sector
activities, and to address problems related to the enforcement of contracts. Under the ongoing Financial
Sector Adjustment Credit, efforts have been initiated to upgrade judges' knowledge of and experience
in financial matters. Similarly, a number of init: ftives have been taken to curb arbitrariness and
corruption in the judicial process. These efforts will be expanded under the proposed Legal and Judicial
Capacity-Building Project.
Building indigenous capacities. The government has learned that technical assistance does not necessarily
build the capacity of indigenous staff and communities to manage their own affairs in a sustainable way.
The previous pattem of technical assistance in Guinea's microfinance programs was oriented toward the
placement of long-term advisors in line management positions. This approach tended to side-line local
counterparts, who were not trained to take over the management of their own institutions.
The strategy taken in the proposed project is to establish a clear training, staff, and systems development
plan and to make institution and capacity building of Guinean staff a stated project objective. At the end of
the project period, Guineans in the Central Bank and in the institutions will be expected to be capable of
supervising, inspecting, and managing their own microfinance institutions. Project-financed technical
assistance (with a time-bound exception at CMG) will be in advisory roles, and capable Guinean staff, who
were recognized during project preparation, will be the line managers, from the director level on down, in
each institution. The project is also oriented toward training and building the capacity of local
communities-that is, toward educating thobe elected by their communities to oversee local branches and
ensure sound financial management.
4. Sector issues to be addressed by the project and strategic choices
The project addresses the role that the decentralized system of microfinance institutions plays in providing
financial services to the majority of Guinea's population, 80 percent of whom are rural, poor, and
unbankable through traditional commercial bank channels. It does this by



Page 10
* Providing institutional, human, and community capacity-building support for the sector generally as
well as specialized support designed to address the strategic issues facing each institution
*  Developing an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework for microfinance institutions and
building capacity within the Central Bank to set perfomnance standards for them and to monitor their
performance.

Component 1: Establishment of a Microfinance Support and Monitoring Unit (MSMU)
A Microfinance Support and Monitoring Unit will be established in the Central Bank. The MSMU will
manage a general perforrnance-based institution-building program consisting of training in various aspects
of financial and institutional management and a competitive model credit union / caisse program (see box
1). The MSMU will develop and agree on a yearly performance-based contract with the headquarters of
each institution. In tum, each headquarters will develop contracts with each of its local caisses. Through
this contract process, the MSMU will monitor and manage the performance-based institution-building
program.
Capacitv building for Central Bank staff. The advisor to the Microfinance Support and Monitoring Unit
will be responsible for coordinating training and skills development for the project coordinator and for the
two Central Bank staff who will be appointed to the unit. Specifically, this person will ensure that staff
participate in the courses indicated in the training plan and summarized in box 2. At the end of the project's
second year, Central Bank staff will
*  Understand the functioning of intemational best-practice institutions and of Guinea's microfinance
institutions
*  Be capable of managing implementation of a new law governing microfinance institutions, including
writing a procedures manual for monitoring and supervision
*  Be able to manage the Model Credit Union Progran
* Have in place a management information, monitoring, and inspection system to track the performance
of microfinance institutions.

Box 1, Model Credit Union Approach
Starting in the late 1980s, the World Council of Credit Unions,(WOCCU) discovered that high-level capacity building was not
a necessary or a sulficient condition for improving performance at the credi union level. WOCCU's reaction and response,
based on pilot effoits in Togo and Guatemala in the late 1980s, was the "mnodel credit union" approach.
In this approach, intensive project efforts in a given country are focused on a limited number (10 to 12) of creditfinions judged
,to have high growth potential, progressive, forward-looking staff, and leadership vith a vision and a desire to excel. The idea is
to transform these credit unions into dynamic, modem financial service enterprises that provide rwing types and volumes of
services to an ever-increasing number of members and to create institutions capable of serving as models for other credit
unions.
The approach is as follows:
* Introduce electronic data processing, including complete transparency, independent external audits at least once a year,
Eaad adoption of generally accepted accounting principles and up-to-date accounts
* Build security and trust through improved security measures that heighten members' confidence in the institution
*  Professionalize staff and services, by adding competent managers and staff and delivering modem financial services
*  Determne what serices members want, through the use of membership sunleys, and deliver them, by moving to a
market-based philosophy where what members want governs all decisionrmaing; this step generally requires charging
interest rates on SF lgs at positive real ("market") levels and setting lending rates high enough to cover.iinreased ....
operating and interest costs, to set aside sufficient bad debt provisions, and to build general.reserves
*  Recognize that tALe credit union as an enterprise must be profitable, solvent, idequately liquid, and growing
*  Achieve balanced performance in the areas of solvency, profitability, asset quality (primnarly delinquen.cy cont.rl), growt.
liquidity management, and fnancial structure, as based on WOCCU's state--f-the-art PEARLS computeized monito
and rating system (this involves introducing prudential standards in each of the six PEARLS categories and in other
-operational areas)-..  '                                                                          . . ... .
Identifying and supporting high levels of performance at model credit unions allow the development of exchange.programs
between weaker and stronger caisses. In this way, weaker institutions learn best practices from institutins in their o  :
country.
Special incentives should be devised and competition fostered to encourage exceptional performance, including:
*  A package of incentives individually tailored to each model credit union's circumstances and perhaps ivolving-rapidiy
declining subsidies of the salaries of new stff, purchase of equipment-especially compute .nde g of promoton
programs, and improvement of physical inftastmcture
*   An incentive system based on the regular publication of a list of all the caisses ranked according to their level :
.performance to stimulate competition am-Ag cisses
*  A:program of study tours to other countries wherehigh-peforming microfinance institutionsave been. identified

Component 2: Specialized assistance for each institution
The program recognizes each institution's complex needs and specific operational issues. A program of
investments, including specialized consulting assistance and performance-based incentives (salary
incentives, equipment, specialized training, and study tours) is reflected in the cost tables for CRG, CMG,
and PRIDE (Annex 2). A summary of the capacity-building program for each institution, which will be
coordinated by the MSMU, is as follows.
Capacity-buildinn for Crrdit Mutuel staff. The project will finance (a) advisory assistance for a strong
team to include the general manager and a finance / electronic data processing advisor who will serve in
line positions for the first 18 months of project implementation to manage CMG's substantial
recapitalization and restructuring process. Thereafter, they will serve as advisors to the Guinean managers
who were judged as capable and who enjoy the support of staff and community elected officials, (b) a
series of short-term consultants in such fields as mutualization (to create local ownership of the caisses by
the communities they serve), inspection systems, training systems, central liquidity management,
management information system development, and others to be identified during project implementation, (c)
training, and (d) equipment and vehicles.
A detailed training and skills development plan for Credit Mutuel was developed during project preparation
based on an audit of staff capacities and needs (see box 3). The training plan will be incorporated into the
performance contract for the team of advisors to be placed at CMG. In addition, the technical assistance
team at Credit Mutuel will be responsible for (a) closing nonperforming Credit Mutuel branches and
ensuring that savings and loan portfolios are transferred to neighboring branches or returned to savers as
appropriate, (b) managing the recapitalization of Credit Mutuel, (c) putting in place financial management
systems, management information systems (computer software), and intemal auditing and inspection
systems at each branch to ensure the institution's sound future management, (d) developing procedures
manuals, and (e) training staff in financial management, cash management, internal auditing, and
inspection.

Capacity-building for Credit Rural staff. The MSMU will provide the following support that is critical to
Credit Rural's potential self-sufficiency:
. Short-term consulting assistance to develop a caisse-based financial management and management
information system, which will allow each caisse to generate its own monthly accounts, to monitor and
control its financial performance, and to enhance internal control and inspection functions
*   Short-term consulting assistance to develop mutualization processes through education, training, and
building a team spirit between elected community officials and salaried agents of the caisses. This will
be accompanied by training for caisse staff and community elected officials in (a) financial
management techniques, (b) techniques to mobilize savings, and (c) internal control systems at the level
of the local caisses
*   Short-term consulting assistance to develop modern personnel management and career development
processes including the development of job descriptions and performance incentive systems for staff
and loan agents.
The MSMU will work jointly with Credit Rural management to coordinate the training and skills
development plan for the staff of Credit Rural as indicated in box 4. This plan covers an estimated 100
salaried staff and community members elected to serve on the management and oversight committees. At
the end of the project period, the staff and community officials will have:
* The capacity to develop monthly financial accounts, including the calculation of ratios to be monitored
by the project
* The capacity to monitor and manage their local caisses for improved perfonnance

Capacitv-building for PRIDE staff. The project will finance capacity-building assistance as follows.
Specific training and equipment needs will be defined in the transformation plan that is currently under
preparation with assistance fromn U.S. Agency for Intemational Development (USAID). It is foreseen that
the following assistance will be necessary.
* Specialized consulting assistance for building the capacity of PRIDE staff, including development of a
decentralized / agent-focused loan approval process
* Equipment and vehicles
* Basic training needs
* Highly specialized training, such as study tours and foreign training, which is included in the MSMU's
special incentive program available competitively to all microfinance institutions through the model
credit union program.
Component 3: Development of a microfinance supervisory and regulatory framework
The project will take a process-oriented approach to assist the Central Bank in revising the current law,
including:
* Organizing exposure study tours for key regulation and supervision staff in the Central Bank to review
the different approaches that have been implemented for the regulation of microfinance institutions
* Providing short-term technical advisory support to help develop an appropriate regulatory framework
and to write a law governing microfinance institutions
* Training Central Bank staff to supervise microfinance institutions



Page 15
*  Helping institutions to improve their internal controls and inspection processes
* The development of capacity and specific financial and management skills among the institutions' staff
and the communities they serve to ensure effective management of the institutions on a sustainable
basis
*  The development within the Central Bank of an appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework for
decentralized microfinance institutions.
2. Key policy and institutional reforms supported by the project
*  To ensure the managerial autonomy of the institutions as they progress toward self-sufficiency,
regulatory and supervisory responsibility for Credit Rural, Credit Mutuel, and PRIDE will be
transferred from the Ministry of Agriculture to the legal authority of the Microfinance Support and
Monitoring Unit in the Central Bank.
*  The government will permit CMG-as part of its restructuring plan-nd any microfinance institution
to open Conakry branches, thereby removing a perceived monopoly granted to any one operator.
In its Statement of Policies to Support Microfinance Development, the government makes the following
commitnents:
*  With respect to the Labor Code, a special policy regime will be agreed between the govermnent and the
World Bank to govem all specialized microfinance institutions, including Credit Rural, Credit Mutuel,
and PRIDE. Specifically, the institutions will be allowed full management autonomy (without political
interference or interference by the Central Bank or other government authorities) to manage staff and
restructure operations, including development of incentive pay arrangements and downgrading and
releasing of staff. It is recognized that microfinance institutions are not banks and cannot abide by
salary structures developed in the Banking Convention. It is also recognized that other restrictions in
the Labor Code unduly restrict the serious restructuring that must take place at these institutions.
*  The Ministry of Finance will continue to arrange for the paymenl: of customs duties and annual taxes
imposed on wireless radio telephony systems, vehicles, computers, and other equipment necessary for
Credit Mutuel, Credit Rural, and PRIDE's decentralized rural-based operations.
*  Government's conmmitment to ensure effective contract enforcement to allow institutions to reduce loan
delinquency and to ensure timely repayment of loans.
* For the terrn of the project, the government will not negotiate, or accept from any other donor, lines of
credit or other programs for Credit Rural, Credit Mutuel, or PRIDE that are inconsistent with the
institutional development and sustainability goals of these programs. All such programs in which
Credit Mutuel, Credit Rural, or PRIDE would potentially participate will be discussed with IDA.
3. Benefits and target population
Over the three-year term of the project, an additional 30,000 (a 25% increase) rural and microenterprise
operators and civil servants will gain access to financial services from microfinance institutions. Over the
medium to long term, Credit Rural, Credit Mutuel, and PRIDE will lbecome sustainable, appropriately
regulated financial institutions as an integral part of Guinea's financial system, thereby assuring that major
segments of the population have access to financial services. Because each institution serves a different
clientele-namely, the agricultural sector and rural poor (Credit Ruial), women-owned infonnal activities
and enterprises (PRIDE), and small businessmen, traders, and civil servants (Credit Mutuel)-
strengthening all three and expanding their outreach will ensure that these three target populations gain
access to appropriate and sustainable financial services.

4. Institutional and implementation arrangements
Microfinance Support and Monitoring Unit
The MSMU established in the Central Bank will handle general institution-building activities and
specialized support for each institution. Day-to-day operations of the unit will be the responsibility of the
Guinean project coordinator-who will be appointed by the government as a condition of project
effectiveness and who will be delegated signatory powers for purposes of the project. He will work with a
long-term advisor and a local administrative staff (who will have accounting skills and undertake training in
bank procurement processes) who will be paid by the project. The principal advisor will work with and
develop the capacity of two high-level Central Bank staff, acceptable to the IDA, who will be appointed as
conditions of project effectiveness. The advisor and the appointed staff will be responsible for monitoring
and supervising the performance of the microfinance institutions, thereby developing this capacity as an
integral function in the Central Bank. The principal functions of the MSMU will be as follows:
* Manage an institutional development program including the development ofperformance contracts for
each rnicrofinance institution and the management of specialized support (management information
system, training, specialized consultancies) designed to address institution-specific needs
- Develop and manage a model caisse / credit union program through competition for special incentives
(study tours, specialized training, and equipment, vehicle, and computer purchases) to encourage the
highest-performing caisses / credit unions to become models and to encourage exchanges between the
best and weaker caisses / credit unions
*  Coordinate consultations with microfinance institutions and write a law that appropriately regulates a
range of microfinance, mutualist, and banking institutions, taking into account the reporting, capital
adequacy, and supervisory requirements of each
* If requested by the board of the newly fonning network of rnicrofinance practitioners, serve as a
professional secretariat for the network and assist the coordination of its activities
* Monitor the achievement ofperformance targets as indicated in each institution's contract and
determine, based on their performance, which institutions will continue or will cease to be funded by
the project
* Provide semestrial progress reports and annual evaluations on the institutions' performance and on
the achievement of project objectives to IDA and the other donors
* Ensure that annual audits of each institution (and of the MSMU) are carried out and review audit
results to confirm the accuracy of progress reports
* Manage projectprocurement and disbursements so that the achievement of semestrial performance
targets for each institution will trigger the commencement of planning and preparation for procurement
of goods and services indicated in that year's contract with the institution. Procurement would begin in
the third quarter if the institution's performance remains on track. If the yearly targets are also
achieved, this early procurement preparation will permit the prompt delivery of project-financed goods
and services.
Implementation arrangements for Credit Mutuel de Guin6e
The government and the Caisse Franoaise de Developpement (CFD) have requested World Bank support
for the institutional aspects of CMG's restructuring. The project will finance (a) technical assistance by a
strong team of advisors to include the general manager, a finance / electronic data processing advisor, and a



Page 17
series of short-term consultants in fields such as mutualization (to create local ownership of the caisses by
the communities they serve), inspection systems, training systems, central liquidity rnanagement,
management information systems development, and perhaps others; (b) basic training, equipment, and
vehicle needs; and (c) special incentives for the model credit union program.
Threshold conditions. The World Bank will provide this support only if the following conditions are met,
indicating government and CFD commnitment to salvaging CMG:
* Completion of an evaluation of CMG's potential viability and development of a credible
restructuring plan by July 31, 1998. This study will (a) evaluate Credit Mutuel's potential to become a
viable institution (this review will evaluate each remaining caisse's institutional and human resource
capacity, its financial status, and the degree of local ownership arnd commitment to maintaining the
caisse as a going concern), (b) recommend options and strategic interventions necessary to put Credit
Mutuel on the path to viability, (c) recommend options for developing appropriate ownership and
governance structures consistent with Credit MutueC's long-term viability.
*  Completion of capitalization by December 1998. Depending on ihe results of the evaluation of Credit
Mutuel's potential viability and development of a credible restructuring plan, the donors will agree with
the government to commnit up to US$8.0 million by December 1998 to recapitalize Credit Mutuel and
approximately US$5.0 million to finance its operating subsidies for the following three years.
Contracting process and performance obiectives. The contract with Credit Mutuel's headquarters will set
standards of performance for the system. This framework contract will be the basis for Credit Mutuel's
development of performance plans and indicators with each local credit union and agreement with them on
the general package of training and other assistance available to them, under the project.
In addition, headquarters and regional delegations will develop more elaborate contracts with each of about
a dozen local caisses considered to have the greatest growth potential as model credit unions. The
procedures to be followed are (a) a complete diagnostic of each model caisse and the elaboration with each
of a yearly plan of operations, (b) negotiation of a con.ract between Credit Mutuel and each local model
caisse (if the semestrial targets are achieved, the project through CMG headquarters will furnish certain
incentives, such as vehicles, computer equipment, study tours, and specialized training), (c) a formal annual
evaluation of the progress of each local model caisse to determine whether it will continue in the program
for another year or whether it will be suspended (in the case of circumstances beyond the control of caisse
management) or terminated from the program. The contracts will specify the support from the project that
will be promised to each model caisse and the expected standards of performance. The level of each
indicator will be different for each model caisse based on its level of performance at the beginning of the
project and on an evaluation of the potential of the market it 'erves.
The technical assistance contract will contain a 20-30% performance incentive that will be disbursed
depending on whether the performance indicators set in the contract for any given year have been met.
Financial projections for CMG and preliminary indicators were developed and agreed during the mission
with CMG management and are contained in Annex 4B. It is projected that CMG could achieve 81%
operational self-sufficiency and 68% financial self-sufficiency by calendar year 2002. Under the model
credit union program, which would encourage competition, some individual caisses could substantially
exceed the targets set for the system as a whole.
Exit plan. If the threshold conditions are not met by June 1999, the government will request that IDA
project funding available for CMG be canceled from the project.

Implementation arrangements for Credit Rural de Guinee
At Credit Rural, the Caisse Francaise de Developpement will continue to finance the operating NGO,
Institut de Recherches et d'Application des Methodologies de Developpement (IRAM). Credit Rural
headquarters will be responsible for managing the contracting processes with local caisses, for monitoring
and reporting on local caisse performance, and for coordinating the delivery of project support to individual
caisses.
Contracting process. The contract with Credit Rural's headquarters will set standards of performance for
the system. This framework contract will be the basis for Credit Rural's development of performance plans
and indicators with each local caisse and agreement with them on the general package of training and other
assistance available to them under the project.
In addition, headquarters and regional delegations will develop more elaborate contracts with about a dozen
local caisses considered to have the greatest growth potential as model caisses. The procedures to be
followed are (a) a complete diagnostic of each model caisse and the elaboration with each of a yearly plan
of operations, (b) negotiation of a contract betweer Credit Rural and each local model caisse (if the
semestrial targets are achieved, the project through CRG headquarters will furnish certain incentives, such
as vehicles, equipment such as computers, study tours, and specialized training), (c) a formal annual
evaluation of the progress of each local model caisse to determine whether it will continue in the program
for another year or whether it will be suspended (in the case of circumstances beyond the control of caisse
management) or terminated from the program. The contracts will specify the support from the MSMU that
will be promised to each model caisse and the expected standards of performance. The level of each
indicator will be different for each model caisse based on its level of performance at the beginning of the
project and on an evaluation of the potential of the market it serves.
Performance objectives. Annex 4A contains detailed financial projections and yearly performance targets
for CRG that were agreed during project preappraisal with CRG management and with CFD after
extensive field visits and consultations. It is expected that by calendar year 2002, CRG will achieve 85%
operational self-sufficiency and 72% financial self-sufficiency including headquarters and other central
overheads. If achieved, this would constitute significant progress from its current level of 54% operational
self-sufficiency. Already about four caisses have achieved operational break-even (excluding central
overheads). Under the model credit union / caisse program, which will encourage competition among
caisses / credit unions, some individual caisses could substantially exceed the targets set for the system as a
whole.
Exit plan. The CFD further agrees to disburse its operating subsidy only to performing branches of Credit
Rural, recognizing that the absence of those subsidies for caisses that do not meet agreed performance
standards will result in the branch's closing. Credit Rural headquarters will be responsible for managing
the return of savings to members of the closed branch and/or the transfer of member savings from the
closed branch to a neighboring one. If CRG does not meet the performance objectives indicated in its
contract with the MSMU, project funds (excluding the technical assistance contract) available for CRG
will not be disbursed until those performance standards are achieved. If for two years in a row, the CRG
system does not achieve the performance targets agreed under the project, the government agrees to request
the cancellation of remaining IDA project funding for CRG. (It is noted that targets set for the first project
year represent modest improvements in performance. CRG will not be challenged until the second project
year).

Implementation arrangements for PRIDE
PRIDE's principal donor, USAID, will continue to finance direct salary costs, technical assistance,
subcontracts, and lines of credit.
Threshold condition. A condition of PRIDE's participation in the project is submission to IDA of an
acceptable transformation plan and financial projections on which to base indicators of performance. This
transformation plan, which will be developed in a participatory fashion with PRIDE staff, is also required
by USAID as a condition for future funding and is already foreseen in PRIDE's current budget. The project
will finance about US$0.5 million of vehicles, equipment, training, and specialized technical advisory
support depending on the achievement of agreed performance targets.
Exit plan. First, if an acceptable "transformation plan" is not submitted to IDA by June 1999, available
funding for PRIDE will be canceled from the project. Second, if included in the project, PRIDE / Finance
will develop yearly contracts with its individual branches based on the standards of performance for the
PRIDE / Finance organization as a whole. If for two years in a row, overall yearly performance does not
meet the standards agreed under the project, the government agrees to request that remaining funding for
PRIDE be canceled from the project.
Development of a regulatory framework for microfinance
The MSMU will
a  Coordinate study tours for senior staff of the Central Bank who play a decisionmaking role in the
regulation of microfinance institutions (including, if possible, the govemor). It is recommended that two
countries in the region as well as two countries outside the region be visited to leam more about
different approaches and to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches with the
regulatory authorities as well as microfinance institutions and their networks in these countries. Visits
are proposed to South Africa (to understand the role of the Alliance of Micro Enterprise Practitioners
in setting and improving industry standards and advising the Central Bank); Bolivia, the first country
to develop a regulatory regime to cope with the development of a microfinance institution bank;
Tanzania, which is developing a regulatory regime for a new microfinance bank; and Benin, which has
a strong credit union movement.
*  Coordinate the hiring of short-term advisors to assist the Central Bank in developing and
operationalizing a new legal and policyframework (legislation, regulations, chartering of
decentralized financial institutions, specification of audit and examination standards, preparation of
new model bylaws) as well as in preparing specific chartering procedures and prudential norms for the
different types of decentralized microfinance institutions.
* Under the rubric of capacity building, intensively support the strengthening of internal controls and
the inspection processes in participating microfinance institutions.
It is proposed that study tours and revisions of the law take place according to the following timetable: (a)
study tours be organized within the first six months of the LIL's effectiveness and (b) the law be revised in
the second half of the LIL's first year of effectiveness. In addition, eabch of the participating institutions will
be required to develop a plan to imnprove its internal controls and inspection procedures with measurable
annual targets.



Pae 20
Monitoring and evaluation
The MSMU will be responsible for
* Quarterly monitoring ofperformance indicators for each individual caisse as well as consolidated
data for the regional and national levels. The institutions will provide these data to the unit by no later
than one month following the end of the quarter.
*  The preparation of semestrial progress reports and annual evaluation reports, which will include a
description of training activities, staffing issues, inspection results, and mutualization processes,
development of new products, services, vision, and strategies, and overall evaluation of progress
toward self-sustainability and institutionalization, including development of the new regulatory and
supervisory framework for microfinance institutions.
D. Project Rationale
1. Project alternatives considered and reasons for rejection
One alternative was to test the project design on one-rather than all three-major microfinance
institutions. This alternative was not retained because there was a clear demand from the Central Bank and
from partner donor agencies to support all three institutions. The Central Bank wishes to develop its
general capacity to monitor microfinance institutions according to performance criteria. Furthermore, it
wishes to encourage all donors to make funding available to microfinance institutions only if project targets
are met. Given that this is not the approach currently taken by the main donors (CFD, USAID), the Central
Bank believes that the World Bank's role is to promote this performance-based approach to supporting
rmicrofinance development. By establishing clear thresholds and exit criteria for each of the three
institutions, donor funding will be more transparent and better adapted to the institutions' strategic needs.
By focusing on only one institution, the World Bank would not have the same legitimacy for establishing a
microfinance support and regulatory unit within the Central Bank. Indeed, if only one institution were
supported, the Bank would be at risk of being perceived by other microfinance institutions as biased and as
favoring the institution financed. By supporting the three leading institutions, as well as others interested in
general capacity-building support, the World Bank can be perceived as a neutral and fair player and be in a
better position to encourage coordination between donors and cross-fertilization between microfinance
institutions.
4X second alternative was to leave Credit Mutuel out of the project because of its poor performance. After a
preliminary but thorough analysis of the institution's strengths and weaknesses and discussions with the
main stakeholders, it was decided that the institution could be saved and that the Bank's participation in the
rehabilitation process is critical. The CFD has been reluctant to go forward with the restructuring of CMG
without the World Bank's support. In fact, even during the preappraisal mission, the World Bank played a
key catalytic role in proposing urgent actions to be undertaken and in starting the implementation of the
restructuring plan (see Value Added of Bank Support).

3. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design
Lessons learned from Bank experience in supporting microfinance institutions have been reflected in the
project design in three areas. First, the Bank has experience in restructuring bankrupt credit union
organizations in West Africa and has demonstrated that these institutions can become self-sufficient. Since
1989, the Bank has played a key role in restructuring the agricultural savings and loans associations in
Benin-now known as FECECAM. The problems faced by this institution in 1989 strikingly resemble the
ones faced by Credit Mutuel today. The lessons learned in working with FECECAM have been analyzed in
a case study produced by Sustainable Banking with the Poor (a research program housed in the Bank).
These lessons will be used as guidelines for CMG's restructuring. In particular, the importance of member
participation and ownership is seen as fundamental, and this aspect must be further developed in Guinea.
Valuable lessons have also been learned from the rehabilitation of creclit unions in the Cote d'Ivoire.
Second, international and Bank experience prove that microfinance institutions can become profitable
ir stitutions if financial self-sufficiency is a clearly identified goal toward which all stakeholders (including
donors) aim. It is also known that sustainability can take up to 15 years to reach in environments such as
Guinea's, where the costs of lending are particularly high because infrastructure and commnunication
networks are poor, population density is low, and illiteracy rates are high. Given the short history of the
microfinance field, there are no more than one or two exarnples of fiaLncially self-sufficient nicrofinance
institutions in Africa. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that saviqgs mobilization plays an importart
role in increasing the sustainability of microfinance institutions-in financial terms and in terms of client
service and ownership. The proposed project takes these findings into account by establishing self-
sufficiency as a clear goal to be achieved within a reasonable time frame and by encouraging savings
mobilization.
Third, the Bank recognizes the importance of an appropriate regulatoiy framework to govem the
development of microfinance institutions. The Bank has analyzed several regulatory frameworks



Page 22
throughout the world and bas acquired a strong reputation in advising governments on the types of
specialized regulations that allow microfinance institutions the flexibility (with respect to collateral, capital,
and reporting requirements) to manage their affairs differently than commercial banks. The Bank's analysis
of the West African Union's PARMEC Law concluded that it effectively regulates institutions organized as
credit unions. However, it limits other types of institutions, such as NGOs, from being legally established
and from transforming into financial institutions. The Central Bank of Guinea has been turning to the West
African Union for advice, assisted in this process by Developpement International Desjardins (DID). The
Bank's experience will be critical in helping the Central Bank understand the strengths and weaknesses of
the PARMEC Law, in exposing Guinea to other countries' more appropriate regulatory frameworks, and in
assisting the Central Bank in designing a regulatory framework that is appropriate for Guinea.
4. Indications of borrower commitment and ownership
The government's commitment to the project is strong, as demonstrated by its willingness to participate in
CMG's recapitalization (US$1.0 million) and to work with CFD to mobilize additional funds (US$13.0
million). The government is committed to CMG's rehabilitation because it is convinced that Credit Mutuel
plays an important role in offering financial services in rural areas and small towns and that clients still
have faith in the institution because they have continued to invest their savings with it. The Central Bank is
convinced that microfinance institutions are key players in financial markets, that they service a clientele
that would never be reached by commercial banks, and that they should be governed by appropriate
regulations and supervisory capacity to ensure their healthy growth. The Ministry of Agriculture has also
demonstrated its commitment to the development of sustainable and sound microfinance institutions. Its
rural finance policy paper explicitly indicates that agricultural and rural credit should be delivered only by
microfinance institutions or banks, not by development projects that tend to subsidize loans and encourage
low repayment rates.
5. Value added of Bank support in this project
First, the World Bank project will bring an investor's perspective to the field. Instead of providing ongoing
subsidies to microfinance institutions whatever their performance as was the case in the past (donor's
perspective), the World Bank will work closely with other donors (CFD, USAID) to ensure that funding is
consistent with the achievement of performance targets. This will help mnicrofinance institutions to adopt a
private sector approach that should yield improved services and profitability.
Second, the Bank has already played a catalytic role in Credit Mutuel's rehabilitation. The Bank acted
quickly to find a managing director to succeed the director appointed by Credit Mutuel de France who left
in March 1998. In that manner, the Bank sent a clear signal to all stakeholders that donors and government
are standing behind CMG and will not abandon it, as was dreaded by all until the preappraisal mission.
Had such a signal not been sent, many believe that the network would have gone adrift and that staff would
have committed massive fraud in anticipation of CMG's demise. The Bank's participation in the
rehabilitation should introduce increased financial discipline.
Third, the Bank's involvement is critical to leverage funds for microfinance development in Guinea.
Although the Bank's contribution through this project is limited to $5 million, total donor contributions
(including CMG's recapitalization) will be in excess of $25 million over the three-year term of the project.
Finally, the Bank's support will be essential in helping the Central Bank to design a regulatory framework
that takes into account all the different institutional types of microfinance providers. Recently, the Central
Bank has been advised by DID, an institution that clearly favors the development of credit unions. Because
the World Bank does not support one methodology or type of institution over another, it will be in a better
position to provide neutral and objective advice to the government.

E. Summary Project Analysis
1. Economic
A Subsidy Dependence Index was calculated for each institution (excluding the costs of technical
assistance). This ratio is intended to indicate the percentage increase in the nominal interest rate that will be
required to allow the institution to cover all its administrative and financial costs (including an imputed cost
of capital). The following table indicates the current Subsidy Dependence Index and the one projected on
the basis of progress expected to be achieved under the project. Over tilme, this ratio is expected to diminish
steadily as the institutions' capacity to cover costs imnproves with increased scale, improved efficiency, and
better management of delinquency and other costs.

2. Financial
Annexes 4A to 4C offer summary financial statements, proposed annual perfonnance targets, and detailed
analyses of Cr6dit Rural and Credit Mutuel according to the PEARLS format used by the World Council
of Credit Unions. The analysis evaluates Protection (evolution of bad debts and reserves to delinquent
loans), Earnings (profitability), Asset quality (principally loan delinquency), Rates of growth, Liquidity,
and financial Structure. A less detailed analysis is also provided for PRIDE.
Fiscal impact: NA
3. Technical
Project expenditures are dedicated to training and advisory support intended to enhance technical
capacities among the institutions' staff and the communities they serve-especially elected members of the
Comites de Surveillance and the Comites de Gestion, which are responsible for overseeing the caisses'
management and financial health.
4. Institutional
a) Executing agencies. The Central Bank of Guinea is the principal executing agency and its former
director of credit, who successfully managed the World Bank-financed Financial Sector Adjustment
Project, will be the project coordinator.
b) Project management. The Microfinance Support and Monitoring Lnit is a newly established entity
whose advisor will be responsible for coordinating project institution-building assistance and for
training Central Bank staff. IRAM (fmnanced by CFD) will continue to advise CRG's newly nominated
Guinean director based on its favorable performance in training staff and developing institutional
capacity at CRG. At Credit Mutuel, a firm that can provide the two long-term advisors as well as the



Pup 24
short-term consultants will be chosen on the basis of competitive selection from among international
firms experienced with credit union operations. Requests for bids will be issued following completion
of the CMG viability study and restructuring plan. The firms' experience and results achieved in terms
of developing sustainable credit unions and microfinance institutions and their track record with respect
to training indigenous staff will receive a heavy weighting in the selection process. This firm will also
be responsible for coordinating the short-term advisory inputs for Credit Rural and PRIDE.
5. Social
Guinea is one of the world's poorest countries, with GDP per capita of about US$500. In addition,
Guinea's social indicators rank unfavorably with those of other Sub-Saharan African countries, although in
recent years these have been improving. In 1992, life expectancy for both men and women was 44 years,
well below the average life expectancy of 51 years for Sub-Saharan Africa. Approximately one in eight
Guineans has access to health care, and only a handful of countries have a higher infant mortality rate than
Guinea's, which is estimated at more than 13 percent. In 1990, the average adult illiteracy rate was 76
percent; an estimtacd 87 percent of women are illiterate.
Guinea is rich in bauxite and other mineral resources, and climatic and soil conditions are conducive to a
wide variety of high-potential agricultural activities. In 1992, the primary sector (agriculture, livestock,
fishing, forestry, and mining) contributed half of GDP and employed more than two-thirds of the country's
2.9 million working population. The secondary sector (manufacturing, energy, and construction)
constituted roughly 11 percent of GDPm and the tertiary sector (commerce, transportation, and
administration) constituted roughly 39 percent of GDP.
The proposed project will contribute to improving the livelihoods of the majority of the population who are
involved in rural-based enterprises and agricultural activities. In addition, traders and civil servants will be
assisted by support to Credit Mutuel.

7. Participatory approach
The priority of this project was determined on the basis of a highly participatory CAS process. The project-
supported mutualization, community, and beneficiary training processes require high levels of community
participation and commitment in the building of strong local caisses.
a) Primary beneficiaries and other affected groups: microentrepreneurs and civil servants, their families,
and the communities in which they live
b) Other key stakeholders: The Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance, which, without the Bank's
catalytic role, would have to finance large recapitalization expenditures for CMG or, if CMG were
allowed to fail, would have to raise resources to recompense savers.
F. Sustainability and Risks
1. Sustainability
Sustainability of microfinance capacity in Guinea depends on high loan repayment rates and significant
expansion of the loan portfolios to increase revenues and achieve increased economies of scale. Thus
sustainability will require strong leadership and commitment within the government, in the institutions, and
among the clientele and their communities. The project will contribute to this process by supporting
development of a strong mutualization process involving the training of local communities, loan officers,
and administrative staff and leading to ownership on the part of communities to their local caisses.
2. Critical risks

3. Possible controversial aspects
Inclusion in the project of Credit Mutuel, a bankrupt institution, coulcl be considered controversial.
However, local communities' continued conumitment to their CMG branches-indicated by their
willingness to increase their savings at CMG-attests to the importance of access to financial services
offered by CMG. Similarly, the government and the CFD are strongly committed to salvaging CMG.
World Bank's willingness to support the restructuring process with a strong, perfornnance-based technical
assistance tearn at CMG is considered critical to ensure that the substantial funds required for
recapitalization are managed wisely toward the objective of achieving a sustainable institution in the future.

Messrs Madavo and Sarbib,
Statement of Policies to Support Microfinance Development
By letter dated 18 November 1998, the Governor of the Central Bank of the Republic of
Guinea, requested World Bank assistance for the preparation of a project to support the
development of an appropriate regulatory framework to govern microfinance institutions
and to assist with the transformation of Credit Mutuel, Credit Rural and PRIDE from
microfinance projects into sustainable microfinance institutions as an integral part of our
country's financial sector. These institutions play a critical role in providing financial
services-savings and credit-to population groups which otherwise do not have access
to banking services. This letter confirms the commitment of the Government of the
Republic of Guinea to these objectives and to maintaining a policy environment which is
consistent with these goals.
As defined during project preparation and appraisal, the following policies are hereby
established to support microfinance development in Guinea.
First, we endorse the perfornance-based approach taken in the proposed Microfinance
Capacity Building project. During preparation of the project, agreement was reached with
each institution and with their principal donors that hencefojrth, financial assistance would
be received by the institutions only if they achieve agreed upon standards of performance.
Non-performing branches would be closed and provision is made for the orderly transfer
of client savings or any outstanding loans to a neighboring branch. The performance
objectives established under the project for Credit Mutuel, C(redit Rural and PRIDE will
also govern the use of other donor funds and any such donor project will be discussed and
agreed with IDA to ensure that it is consistent with the institutions' performance
objectives.
Second, establishment of the Microfinance Support and Coordination Unit (MSMU) in
the Central Bank is a highly welcome and appropriate response. The role of the MSMU
will be to develop within the Central Bank its capacity to monitor and support the
development of microfinance institutions and to manage the capacity building assistance
that is being provided under the project. Performance manaLgement and monitoring will be
achieved through the deielopment of annual contracts with. each institution and the
provision of project assistance to the institutions which perfbrm according to agreed
standards.



Page 32
Several policy, regulatory and judicial issues which affect microfinance institutions were
identified which we wish to address in this letter.
First, it has been identified that certain provisions of the Labor Code could inhibit the
flexibility required by management to restructure Credit Mutuel and to achieve improved
efficiency in the other microfinance institutions. To address this issue, the Government
agrees with IDA that for the term of the project, a special policy regime will govern all
specialized microfinance institutions, including Credit Rural, Credit Mutuel, and PRIDE.
Specifically, the institutions will be allowed full management autonomy (without political
interference or interference by the Central Bank or other Government authorities) to
manage staff and restructure operations, including development of incentive pay
arrangements, downgrading, and releasing staff. It is recognized that microfinance
institutions are not banks and cannot abide by salary structures developed in the Banking
Convention. It is also recognized that other restrictions in the Labor Code unduly restrict
the serious restructuring which must take place at these institutions.
Second, The Ministry of Finance will continue to arrange for the payment of customs
duties and annual taxes imposed on wireless radio telephony systems, vehicles, computers,
and other equipment necessary for Credit Mutuel, Credit Rural, and PRIDE's
decentralized rural-based operations.
Third, recognizing the importance of the heavily populated Conakry market to their
scaling up and potential viability, all microfinance institutions would be allowed to set up
operations in the Conakry market and the Central Bank will attempt to manage any
predatory competition which might result.
And finally, the government is commnitted to ensuring that effective contract enforcement
will allow all banking and microfinance institutions to effectively reduce loan delinquency
and to ensure timely repayment of loans. The Ministry of Justice is committed to working
with the project and to become directly involved, if necessary, to ensure the jailing of
those found guilty in cases of embezzlement and fraud. There will be no tolerance for
corruption and political interference in contract enforcement processes necessary to ensure
the repayment of loans. In cases where contract enforcement has been lax because of
apparent corruption or political interference, the Ministry of Justice makes a commitment
to become directly involved in collaboration with IDA and the MSMU.
To ensure the development of permanent improvements in the contract enforcement
processes of our legal and judicial system, the Government welcomes the opportunity to
commence development of the Legal and Judicial Reform Project as part of IDA's lending
program to Guinea.
And finally, for the term of the project, the Government will not negotiate or accept from
any other donor, lines of credit or other programs for Credit Rural, Credit Mutuel, or
PRIDE that are inconsistent with the institutional development and sustainability goals of



Page 33
these programs. All such programs in which Credit Mutuel, Credit Rural, or PRIDE
would potentially participate will be discussed and agreed with IDA.

Background Analysis of Credit Rural de Guinee
Credit Rural de Guinee is a rural banking system that extends credit and mobilizes savings for the poor in
Guinea. It was created in 1980 by the Institut de Recherches et d'Application des Methodologies de
Developpement (TRAM), a French NGO, as a pilot project designed to test the methodology of the
Grameen Bank in rural areas of Guinea. Credit Rural operates under the auspices of the Ministry of
Agriculture and Animal Resources. Credit Rural is financed by the Caisse Francaise de Developpement
(CFD), the European Development Fund, the African Development Bank, and USAID. Donor funds are
received as grants by the head office in Conakry. As a donor-funded project, Credit Rural has no legal
status.
The project currently has 57 local branches (caisses)-up from 45 at the end of 1996-distributed through
each of Guinea's four regions: Guinee Maritime, Haute Guinee, Moyenne Guinee, and Guinee Forestiere.
Although each caisse is managed independently, the head office coordinates the operations of the caisses
and provides centralized administration, accounting, training, and inspection. Six regional offices function
as administrative and financial liaisons between the head office and the caisses. Credit Rural employs 180
finance-related staff, including 119 credit agents and 6 regional delegations, which serve the caisses in each
region. There are 53 persons at the head office. Now, with only three expatriates, the Credit Rural system
has been successfully "indigenized" with capable managers, local credit agents, and an impressive system
of voluntary management by local community members who are elected because of their social or moral
standing within the community.
Between 1989 and 1994, the number of clients grew from 250 to 31,000, and by 1997 that number had
increased to about 53,000. As of December 1996, the project had a lending portfolio of GF4.2 billion
(US$A .2 million) and had accumulated GF2.0 billion (US$2.0 million) in savings, of which 25 percent are
forced savings, and the remainder are voluntary deposits. The average loan amount is GF7 1,000 (US$71),
and the maximum loan amount (initially set at GF300,000 or US$300) varies with the type of instrument.
Half of the clients are engaged in agricultural activities-primarily the production, processing, and sale of
agricultural products-and the other half are engaged in small trade and artisanal production. Client
composition, to a large extent, reflects socioeconomic conditions in rural areas: half are women, and 70
percent are illiterate.
Credit services
Small farmers, producers, and retailers in rural areas are eligible to apply for loans. Under its statutes,
which are designed to limit lending to lower-income groups, Credit Rural is prohibited from lending to civil
servants and other middle-class groups. To be eligible for credit, borrowers must form groups of five
members who guarantee one another's loans.
The first step in establishing a new caisse is for agents to conduct a general socioeconomic study of
potential districts. Once a district has been identified in an adequately high-density area with at least 10,000
inhabitants within a 13-mile radius, approval is sought and caisse agents carry out a more detailed study of
the region's geographic, economic, cultural, and religious conditions. Because borrowers attach great
importance to physical structures, the next step is to rent an office and install a safe.
Next, caisse agents organize meetings with local authorities, including the council of elders, to introduce the
terms and conditions of the financial services offered. This is followed by a larger meeting for the general
population. Additional, more focused meetings are then held to discuss the project in detail with interested
individuals. These meetings usually take place in public places within the community such as the mosque or
market.



Page 48
The following stage is the formation of groups. Prospective borrowers must form groups of five, segregated
by gender. Because caisse agents as a rule are outsiders to the region, they rely on the local knowledge of
the council of elders, who review and approve all requests to form groups. Because of their natural
authority and their knowledge of the community in which they live, members of the council of elders play a
critically important role in screening credit and ensuring prompt repayment. Members of the council of
elders (les elus) are not remunerated for the duties they perform for Credit Rural.
Once groups have been formed, prospective borrowers receive training from caisse agents that (a) conveys
basic lending principles such as the terns and conditions of the loan and the obligations of the borrower,
(b) familiarizes them with loan documents in the local language, and (c) teaches them how to sign loan
documents. On average, prospective borrowers receive about four training sessions. A test is given at the
end of training, and if one individual fails, the entire group is blocked from borrowing until that member
passes the test. Those who pass the test can then submit a loan application.
The following types of loans are available:
*  Rural credit loans (66.5 percent of loans), which provide loans for agricultural and artisanal
production and trade. First-time borrowers can obtain loans ranging from GF50,000 to GF150,000
(US$50-US$150) for a maximum term of 12 months. If the loan is repaid satisfactorily, subsequent
loan amounts can increase each year: up to GF200,000 (US$200) the second year, GF250,000
(US$250) the third year, and GF300,000 (US$300) the fourth year. This self-screening mechanism
based on demonstrated ability and willingness to pay successively larger loans is a basis of successful
microfinance credit management. There are also special credit lines for rainy season agricultural
credit (30 percent), which primarily finances activities during the rainy months between April and July
for which the maximum loan amount is GF80,000 (US$80), and dry season agricultural credit (2.5
percent), which provides loans for activities during the dry months between October and December
*  Medium-term loans, which are available to borrowers who have a satisfactory repayment history on
previous loans for two consecutive years. Loan amounts range from GF150,000 to GF350,000
(US$150-US$350) for a maximum term of 24 months at 30 percent interest a year. Loans from
GF500,000 to GF2.5 million (US$500-US$2,500) are also available to finance nonagricultural
activities. Such loans are used to finance the purchase of carts, bicycles, or equipment for artisans.
However, because incomes are low, demand for these larger loans is limited.
Savings services
Credit Rural provides three main savings products: voluntary savings, forced savings, and safety deposit
boxes for public institutions.
*  Voluntary savings are available to all members. The savings programn was established in 1990 partly in
response to management's concem about inadequate capital funds. Many voluntary savers are civil
servants (who are excluded from borrowing) and local institutions as well as low-income individuals.
Savers can make deposits and withdrawals at any time. The only requirements are a minimum deposit
and a balance of GF2,500 (US$2.50) at all times.
*  Forced savings are a guarantee fund that provides for loan loss. Depending on the type of loan, a
percentage of the loan amount ranging from 5 to 10 percent is automatically placed into a forced
savings account. Borrowers cannot withdraw these funds until they have repaid their loans.
*  A safety deposit box is available for public institutions that wish to keep their cash in the safe of the
caisse. Instead of receiving interest on savings, depositors pay an annual fee of 2 percent for the service



Page 49
(the fee includes record keeping). Funds can be withdrawn at any tine, so they are not used to make
loans.
An attractive feature of the savings services offered by Credit Rural is a service called remote withdrawals.
Used primarily by rural merchants who travel to Conakry to buy products, this service allows them to make
withdrawals at the head office in Conakry rather than at the local branch, thus eliminating the risk of
carrying large amounts of cash on the road. The rules are sirnple: the client must maintain a minimum
balance of GF500,000 (US$500) in a savings account, the withdrawal cannot exceed 50 percent of the
savings balance, and the maximum withdrawal amount is GFI million (US$1,000).
Overall institutional performance and goals
Credit Rural's principal strength is that over its 10 years in existence il. has perfected a credit management
methodology that is strongly rooted in the community and uses an appropriate mix of salaried and trained
credit agents with a system of group- and community-based credit management. With respect to the goal of
achieving financial self-sufficiency, its weaknesses are principally in three areas:
*  Inefficient scale. Growth, however, must be achieved by paying continuous attention to staff and
member training and offering appropriate incentives to credit agenis to increase the number of clients
served. Branch-level productivity and income are an important aspect of the effort to reduce the overall
costs of administration as a share of income-earning assets.
*  Insufficient earnings and cost recovery. Interest rates must be calculated based on a reasonable
progression of recovery of operating and financial costs. Currently, the interest rate does not impute a
cost of capital and is not sufficient to cover even basic administrative costs.
*  Rising delinquency. A stricter definition of delinquency-loan amounts with a payment of 30 days
late-must be adapted. Best-practice institutions calculate delinquency as an entire loan amount plus
interest when a payment is even one day late. A strict definition neexds to be implemented as soon as
possible to ensure the type of credit discipline necessary for profitability and successful institutional
growth.
* Neglect of savings mobilizatt z. This has become a problem recently.
For the long-term, Credit Rural's strategy is to become an autonomous, private, legal institution capable of
operating independently of donor funds. The institutional structure envisaged is that of a private bank in
which each caisse is a shareholder, management is decentralized, and the government has a minimal role.
Toward that end, the intermediary step is to transform Credit Rural into a private institution. To that end,
the CFD has proposed creating a foundation as a separate entity managed by a board representing various
donor agencies. This foundation will finance the private institution until it becomes self-financing. At that
point, Credit Rural will operate as a private bank within which each caisse will function as a local branch.

PEARLS Analysis of Credit Rural de Guin4e
Protection:
As of 31/12/96, the amount of bad debt provisions plus the loan guarantee fund
amounted to 151% of delinquent loans, so that the provisions cover the bad debt risk
exposure entirely. For Africa, this is a relatively comfortable level of protection, and
if Credit Rural continues to maintain this ratio at the 150% level, the network will
maintain a degree of solvency that is already quite solid. However, as explained
below, the rate of loan delinquency has grown to 18% in 1997, and the bad debt
provisions are therefore not excessive.

yields only around 24%. It should be pointed out that for the purposes of calculating
the yield on the loan portfolio, the consultant had to use an average portfolio balance
based on the balance outstanding at the beginning and at the end of each financiad
year. The balance outstanding involves considerable seasonality, and is near its
highest point at year-end.  The ratio's denominator being hence somewhat
overestimated, one would naturally expect the loan portfolio yield to differ somewhat
from the nominal lending rate. The growing rate of loan delinquency also contributes
to making the actual portfolio yield less than the nominal lending rate.
During the last three financial years (1993 to 1996), Credit Rural's operating
expenses have declined from  41%  to 30%  of assets, indicating a significant
improvement in operating efficiency. One might reasonably expect this trend to
continue, and to decline to perhaps 24% durng the next five years. For the moment
though, interest on loans cannot cover all operating costs, let alone bad debt
provisions. If Credit Rural seeks to take those decisions today that will permit it to
achieve full break-even within five years, it should include in its calculations a cost
of capital of at least 8% (previously, Credit Rural paid 10% on savings, but the
average effective return on savings has now declined to around 4%), a bad debts
provision of at least 4%, plus contributions to general reserves of, say, 3%. It is thus
evident that to break even, the loan portfolio yield will have to be increased to around

41% (24 + 8 + 4 + 4 + 3). The WOCCU/CFD/IRAM evaluation team proposes,
accordingly, that the interest rate on-loans be raised from 30% to 36% (to facilitate
interest calculations using a monthly rate of 3%), and that a loan processing fee of
4% be instituted in addition. The combination of a 36% lending rate and a 4% loan
processing fee would be the equivalent of a 41% lending rate, since the 4% loan
processing fee is itself equivalent to an additional 600 basis points in terms of yield
on the overall portfolio.
The consultant also undertook several computerized financial simulations to test the
impact of a number of different scenarios. The results can be found in Attachment
B. These simulations confirm that to achieve its break-even point within five years,
Credit Rural de Guinee needs to raise its interest rate on loans and institute a loan
processing fee such that together the loan portfolio yields at least 41%.
Asset Quality
Until recently, the level of loan delinquency was fairly consistently running around
10%, a relatively reasonable level for such a decentralized financial system.
However, in 1997, the loan delinquency has increased to around 18%, principally as
a result of the closure of all of Guinea's borders, which caused a substantial decline
in the prices of agricultural products, as well as reduced borrowers' purchasing power
and repayment capacity. Cr6dit Rural de Guinee's management is, however,
convinced that loan delinquency will soon return to its historically "normal" level of
around 10%.

Another remarkable fact is that as of 31/12/96, only 64% of Credit Rural's assets
were invested in loans or other interest-bearing investments (principally commercial
bank placements). For the network to really attain break-even, the proportion of
assets producing interest will have to be increased considerably (and had been
previously). One of the principal causes of this shortfall is the rather large amount
of receivables (approximately 15% of assets). Since the external audit of Credit
Rural's 1996 accounts did not dispute the value of these receivables, the consultant
assu.nes that they are really collectible. Just the same, having such a large
proportion of assets not producing income has a signific,ant negative impact on the
network's profitability.

(Annual) Rates of Growth:
The annual rate of growth in the number of clients has declined from 40% in 1994 to
less than 20% in 1996. For this type of institution, an annual growth rate of 20% is
still quite respectable, however, and would have been even higher if not for a
considerable number of clients quitting Cr6dit Rural. It is important to add that in
decentralized financial systems, client growth is usually quite linear (with about the
same number of net new members per year), and therefore the annual growth rate
in percentage terms by the nature of things will normally drop over time, even if
membership continues to grow by about the same number of people each year.
In financial terms, however, savings, loans outstanding and assets are all growing
at rates less than Guinea's inflation rate. In real terms, h,erefore, client savings
deposits and loans outstanding are decreasing, instead of growing. Up to the
present point in time, Credit Rural has placed only very limited emphasis on savings
mobilization, and for this reason the weak savings growth is not surprising.
Throughout the mission, the various representatives of Cr6dit Rural encountered
nearly uniformly insisted that the population in the districts where they operate is "too
poor to save" in any significant way. However, WOCCU's experience in similar
environments (Niger and Madagascar, for example), have clearly demonstrated that
even the poorest people do save. Furthermore, this experience shows that if they
perceive the network to be a safe place, and if their deposits earn competitive
interest rates, they WILL save. Credit Rural de Guinee management (IRAM).
however, remains unconvinced. Still, during the mission, it was also evident that an
increasing number of Guinean staff, at least, recognize that the only means of
attaining true financial independence from donors is to attract much greater savings
volumes. It should also be pointed out that in the turbulent area of West Africa where
Credit Rural opcrates, the risk of a precipitous disappearance of most or all donors
(and their lines of credit and grants) is quite high. For example, despite a very
successful credit union development project in Niger, the January, 1996, coup d'etat
precipitated a quick abandonment of the country, particularly by bilateral donors. to
"punish" the coup leaders. WVOCCU recommends that the principal financial
parameters (savings, loans outstanding, and assets) grow annually by at least the
rate of inflation PLUS 5%. If this is not achieved, the value of clients' accounts (both
savings and loans) depreciates. Credit Rural has not achieved this type of growth
in recent years. The lack of loan portfolio growth is not due to insufficient funds, but
rather results from the blocking of new loans in districts that have loan delinquency

levels greater than allowed (ALL new loans in a distric:t are halted if delinquency
exceeds  a  certain  threshold).    For  1998, the  sltrategy  proposed  by  the
WOCCUICFD/IRAM evaluation team is therefore to place the accent on decreasing
loan delinquency, as well as on the effective "mutualization" of the network to permit
a more rapid expansion starting in 1999.
Liquidity:
Credit Rural's end-of-year liquidity has remained in recent years a rather constant
10% of assets, which exceeds the minimum levels in WOCCU's PEARILS standards.
However, if one considers the long distances between the local branches of Credit
Rural and the very few branches of commercial banks, this level of liquidity is
certainly not excessive. Some slight improvements in liquiidity management could be
foreseen, but the potential for improvement is not high. As indicated in the following
chart, a significant improvement in liquidity management Ihas already been achieved
in recent years.

Financial Structure:
WOCCU recommends that decentralized financial systems (DFS's) invest a
maximum of 5% of their assets in fixed assets. Currently, Credit Rural invests 15%
of its funds in vehicles, computer equipment and other equipment. The fact that the
15% of assets thus invested don't produce any interest income also has a significant
negative effect on Cr6dit Rural's overall profitability.
A second significant finding in this area concems the ratio of the proportion of assets
earning interest to the proportion of total liabilities and capital that have a cost of
capital (i.e., interest) attached to them. In other countries, this ratio is considered a
fairly reliable precursor and warning of impending bankruptcy for DFS's. In the case
of Credit Rural de Guinee, the evolution of this ratio is, for the moment, quite
reasonable - it is close to 200%, while WOCCU's PEARLS norm is only 100%. If
Credit Rural puts more emphasis on the mobilization of savings, however, this ratio
will decline rapidly. The evolution of assets and liabilities bearing interest is shown
in the following chart:

Overall Performance:
The overall financial performance of the Credit Rural de Guinee network, as
measured by WOCCU's PEARLS index, deteriorated slightly in 1995, but did not
deteriorate further during 1996. Apart from the recent surge in loan delinquency, the
Credit Rural network remains, overall, within the norms, as indicated in the following
chart. Since Credit Rural does not prepare monthly financial statements, it is not
possible to know how their overall performance has evolved during 1997. However,
because of the significant recent increase in loan delinquency, a recent PEARLS
score, if one had the data to compute it, would undoubtedly have been somewhat
lower than the 1996 year-ending score.

Background and PEARLS Analysis for Credil: Mutuel de Guinke
Credit Mutuel de Guinee was designed in 1988 and is implemented by the Centre International du Credit
Mutuel (CICM) in France. It is based on the traditional credit and savings cooperative model developed in
France and Germany in the nineteenth century. This project is financed by various donors, including the
Caisse Francaise de Developpment, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the World
Bank. Most caisses operate in rural areas, mobilizing demand deposits and providing loans to individuals.
The program was started in large part because of the dearth of financial services in rural Guinea. Since
they have been privatized, commercial banks have progressively pulled out of the interior and now have
only six or seven branches outside Conakry.
At its peak, Credit Mutuel de Guinee had grown to more than 50,000 members (30 percent of whom are
women) with 80 branches. On average, caisses have 642 members. FRequests to open a caisse can come
directly from a village or from a donor, if the caisse would complement another program financed by that
donor. These requests result in Credit Mutuel calling for e large meeting in the proposed town. During this
first meeting, staff explain the rules and benefits of the savings and loan cooperative to potential members
and make an initial assessment of the demand for such a project. If enlough people are interested, those
attending will elect a steering committee with the advice of the local wise men and imams. This committee
eventually will become the board. Caisse members meet yearly in a general assembly to elect or reelect a
board of 12 people (most of whom are literate) and to examine the pi-ogress of the caisse. Board members
are not paid. They elect a president and approve loan applications up to GF1 million (US$1,000). The
president of the board hires one or two caisse agents, who are remunerated by the headquarters in Conakry.
Until recently directed by an expatriate from CICM, the headquarters in Conakry has a staff who
supervises the eight regional offices, assists with promotional campaigns, approves loans between GF1O
million and GF20 million (US$10,000-US$20,000), centralizes accounting, takes care of general
administration, and manages public relations with the donors that finance the program.
In several instances, a donor has imposed the opening of a caisse in a. location that does not meet the
program's eligibility criteria. In general, such caisses have remained unprofitable. Donor intervention into
the process of creating and managing caisses has severely weakened community comnmitment and control.
Combined with weak internal controls, this has resulted in major loan losses at Credit Mutuel.
Savings mobilization
All members of Credit Mutuel are active savers. The bulk of savings (70 percent) comes from people with
fixed incomes such as civil servants and large traders. Credit Mutuel captures the bulk of savings in a given
area because there are no banks in the area, the caisses protect savers from theft and from social and family
pressures, individuals must save for a minimum of six months before they can take a loan, and individuals
must save a minimum of 50 percent of the amount that they borrow.
Unlike Credit Rural, the bulk of Credit Mutuel's financial activities axe related to savings. In 1996, savings
totaled GF7.3 billion (US$7.3 million), including a small share of medium- and long-term deposits. Loans
stood at only GF1.2 billion (US$1.2 million).
Overall institutional performance and goals
According to a review commissioned by CFD, the principal cause of Credit Mutuel's problems is a series
of "detoumements"--embezzlement-in a majority of the branches. This embezzlement happened in the
traditional ways and was discovered in the difference between control accounts and individual ledgers.



Page 63
Unfortunately, the review indicated that as a result of inadequate internal controls and supervision, the
instances of embezzlement had started as early as 1994 and steadily increased. Today, the total of
embezzled sums stands at GF528 million or more than 10 percent of deposits.
Embezzlernent:
* In 1994, 4 caisses, GF15.7 million (US$15,700)
* In 1995, 9 caisses, GF233.0 million (US$233,000)
* In 1996, 14 caisses, GF279.5 million (US$279,000)
CFD has put in place an 18-month intensive restructuring programn that includes the following measures:
the introduction of a microfinance computer program, which has helped to identify the source of problems;
an advisor to oversee the restructuring program, which has focused on putting in place procedures of
intemal control and inspection and intensive collection efforts on delinquent loans; the closure of
particularly problematic caisses (approximately half of the total) and the transfer of savings to Credit Rural
branches; an audit of the 1995 accounts and preparation of 1996 accounts; and careful budgetary controls.
Going forward, the plan is to put in place a fastidious process of inspecting the account books of savings
caisses and an inspectorate to ensure ongoing internal controls and supervision.
Although the current situation at Credit Mutuel is bleak, the mission views with optimism the possibility of
Credit Mutuel's recovery. In fact, there are examples of several now-best-practice credit union programs
that had once fallen onto hard times as a result of poor internal discipline. The most relevant of these is in
nearby Benin, where FECECAM was restructured and is now one of the most successful credit union
movements in Africa. FECECAM's success was achieved following a two-year restructuring program,
similar to the one being implemented in Guinea. Today FECECAM boasts a thriving membership of
200,000 characterized by impressive local ownership and commitment.

Credit Mutuel de Guin6e
The short duration of the Mission, as well as the enormous amount of work
involved in evaluating Credit Rural, plus the fact that Credit Mutuel de Guinee's
Manager and other key staff were not in Conakry during our visit, meant that the
analysis of Credit Mutuel had to be based principally on older documents
previously provided the consultant by CFD in Paris, and only slightly on
interviews of available Credit Mutuel staff. Certain financial statements were too
abbreviated and skeletal, making it impossible to carry out an in-depth analysis
as was done for Credit Rural. Nonetheless, certain conclusions can be drawn
from the available financial and statistical dala. The definitive 1996-ending
financial statements for the network, promised by the CICM Manager in October,
were not yet, in fact, available. However, Credit Mutuel de Guinee did supply
the consultant with a draft balance sheet as of December 31, 1996, which was
incorporated into the analysis.
The following analysis represents observations and conclusions that, in most
cases, are undoubtedly close to reality, despite the sketchiness of available
financial data. Because of limited data, some data and remark<s presented here
may be slightly erroneous, but even in those cases, the degree of error is
probably not high. If the consultant has inadvertently erred in interpreting the
available information, he hopes that Credit Mutuel will forgive him. On the other
hand, for a financial institution, unavailability of financial statements nearly a
year after the end of a financial year is telling in and of itself.
Protection:
Detailed information (loan delinquency schedule, principally) on the quality of
Credit Mutuel's loan portfolio is not available. It is, accordingly, impossible to
determine whether existing bad debt provisions and reserves are adequate to
cover estimated bad debts. One document av,ailable indicated, however, that
about one-half of the 3.2 billion FG in loans outstanding were delinquent

of delinquency is unknown. The approximately one billion FG in bad debt
provisions is, though, probably adequate or close to, adequate.
Profitability
Since half or more of Credit Mutuel's loan portfolio is delinquent, the gross rate
of return on loans has been in the 12% to 14% range, that is, about half of the
nominal rate of 24%. After deducting operating costs (32% of assets) and
interest on savings deposits of 8%, not to mention bad debt provisions and
depreciation of vehicles and equipment, Credit Mutuel's recurring operating
deficit is at disastrous levels. To avoid complete failure, loan delinquency and
out of control operating costs need to be quickly mastered. If not, the network
is sliding rapidly toward bankruptcy.

Asset Quality
The very high loan delinquency rate contributes to a very negative score in this
area. Credit Mutuel admits that 51% of loans are delinquent. The fact that only

assets are invested in non-interest-bearing bank accounts, receivables and
other nonproductive assets. With the vast majority of assets not producing any
interest, it is impossible for the network to achieve break-even at any volume.
Annual Growth Rates:
A  financial institution  that doesn't grow  is a dying financial institution.  If
deposits, loans and assets don't grow at at least the inflation rate, the institution
decapitalizes itself, which is what is currently taking place in Credit Mutuel de
Guinee. Undoubtedly because of the financial crisis, the number of members
has been stagnant in recent years, reflecting a decline in public confidence in
the institution.

The lesson to be drawn from the failure of Credit Mutuel de Guinee is that its
management was in too much of a hurry to obtain results and "impact." Heavy
sums (12% of assets) were immobilized in fixed assets. A staff that neither the



Page 67
caisses locales nor the headquarters could afford was hired. And probably the
straw that broke the camel's back was Credit Mutuel's acceptance of external
lines of credit (now only 2% of assets, down from nearly 100% in 1993) to
rapidly "grow" the loan portfolio (again, to obtain "impact"). The non-respect of
the caisses locales' normal growth pattern cost the institution dearly.

|   Productive Assets          [     % of Total Liabiltes & Capital Beanng Interest
The ratio of productive (i.e., interest-bearing) assets to interest-bearing liabilities
yields a disastrous score for Credit Mutuel. In fact, it's the lowest score this
consultant has ever seen anywhere, and the reader is reminded that this ratio
is considered by many to be a key predictor of imminent credit union failure
Overall Performance:
The overall PEARLS score for the Credit Mutuel de Guinee network clearty
shows the catastrophic crisis that the institution currently finds itself in. The
overall performance was already at a low level in 1994, and declined
substantially more in 1995 and 1996, even to the point that the score has
become negative. Clearly, Credit Mutuel de Guinee's performance has been
disastrous. The chart below starkly shows the decline of Credit Mutuel de
Guinee:

PRIDE
The following is basically a resume of discussions held at PRIDE/Guinee's
headquarters office in Conakry by the consultant. In Attachment C, the reader
will find several recent documents prepared by PRIDElGuinee which provide
further information. For lack of time, neither the consultant nor PRIDE/Guin6e
were able to put together the financial and statistical information necessary to
effect a PEARLS analysis of the network, or assetss its overall management.
Because the consultant was not able to evaluate the network's financial
performance, it is quite possible that its actual performance is worse than what
might be implied by the following discussion. Even if its performance is as good
as implied by its representatives, it may be important to remember that its
clientele is relatively much wealthier that most of the members of the Credit
Rural and Credit Mutuel networks. For that reaison, its success should in
principal should be easier to achieve than is the case of Credit IRural or Credit
l\A^tuel.
For quite some time now, PRIDE has been divided into two distinct programs -
the part that finances SMEs, and the unit that provides technical training to SME
owners. VITA (Volunteers in Technical Assistance), an American NGO, provides
technical assistance to PRIDE/Guin6e in the development of these two product
lines with financial assistance from USAID. Other donors have also contributed
to the project. PRIDE/Guinee is currently in the process of dividing itself into two
separate legal entities: an NGO specializing in the training of SME owners, and
the other is a financial institution (etablissement financier). Technical assistance
in both areas is provided by VITA. The consultant met VIlA's Technical
Assistant, whose job is to "institutionalize" PRIDEIGuinee. The Executive
Director of the NGO part, Mr. Balde Alpha Mamadou, and the National Director
of the financial institution, M. Tidiane Barry, were both unfortunately not
available, thus limiting the discussions to just thie consultant and the VITA
Technical Assistant, Mr. Richard Kimball.
The assistance provided to PRIDE/Guinee by VITA is a component of the
Guinea Rural Enterprise Development Project (GREDP) financed by USAID.
The consultant explained the purpose of the joint CFD/WOCCU/IRAM mission,
and the VITA Technical Assistant briefly explained PRIDE/Guinee's operations,
its problems and its aspirations.
Operations:
PRIDE/Guinee's financial products, as well as its loan policies and procedures,
are very similar to those of Credit Rural de Guinee. In fact, Mr. Kimball
explained that at its outset, PRIDElGuinee "borrowed" heavily from Credit
Rural's experience. What distinguishes PRIDE funclamentally from Credit Rural
is the heavy importance PRIDElGuinee gives to training borrowers in business
management. And apparently borrowers like it; they are willing and actually pay
for the cost of training received. A second major difference which greatly affects
their "bottom line" is the insistence that all loan officers be university graduates,
which means that their salaries and benefits are much higher than those of
Credit Rural. With a 13th month's salary, plus a well-developed bonus system
based on staff performance, a PRIDE/Guinee loan officer may eam, depending
on his/her performance, two to three times as much as his/her counterpart at

Credit Rural. As one might expect, this enormous cost has made it difficult for
PRIDE to attain break-even. * However, the new staff incentive systems
(including a profit-sharing plan), and the growing number of larger loans up to
5.000.000 FG, leads PRIDE to hope that it can reduce its operating costs from
the current level of 70% of assets to a more acceptable 25% to 30%. Another
difference is the emphasis placed on continuous training of staff. PRIDE/Guinde
has a very developed "training of trainers" methodology that requires newer staff
to be trained by the "doyens," i.e., more senior staff. Despite a very limited
training budget, using its own creativity, PRIDE/Guinee has been able to provide
a considerable amount of training to its staff (thanks also to the utilization of
"participant training"' funds for staff training from USAID). Thanks to the latter,
they are able to send staff to the principal gatherings of microfinance
practitioners in Washington, Boulder, etc., so that they can keep up-to-date on
the latest microfinance techniques. A last major difference is the importance
attached to performance. It's a different culture that includes, for example,
monthly contests to be named the "best employee of the month," the "best
Supervisory Committee of the year," etc., a constantly-improved and powerful
MIS that rewards high performance and penalizes inferior performance with
sanctions, public humiliation, etc. Despite a budget crisis due to an unexpected
cut in the USAID grant, PRIDE/Guinee still plans to use its own funds to develop
several additional features into its MIS by the end of 1997.
PRIDE/Guinee's current loan portfolio is around 1.3 billion FG, which means that
theyll have to practically triple their loan volume to attain their break-even point.
estimated by PRIDE at 3 billion FG. The usual (more than three-fourths)
purpose of loans granted, now averaging more than 40.000 FG per loan per
year, is commerce, and a majority of that is for marketing of agricultural produce
PRIDE/Guinee charges borrowers 24%/year on their loans' unpaid balances
but after inclusion of training costs, forced savings and the solidarity fund
contribution, the real cost to the borrower is in the neighborhood of 46% to 50%
depending on the loan's term (i.e., duration). PRIDElGuinee has a dozen
branches in 12 of Guinea's largest secondary cities, plus two branches in
Conakry financed by CFD. The network plans to open three additional branches
soon outside of Conakry, but is refocusing its efforts in Conakry itself.
In 1994, PRIDE/Guinee had planned to introduce a voluntary savings program
but because of USAID budget cuts, they had to reduce staff, and have decided
that other things have a much higher priority for the moment, and that savings
can wait. During the budget crisis, PRIDE/Guinee had to lay off severad
employees, which created somewhat of a panic among remaining staffefs
Several of their senior staff "abandoned ship" for greener pastures (they
thought), thus aggravating the organization's problems. This is a lesson that
Credit Rural would be wise to remember during its own institutionalization
efforts. In the past, USAID financed 100% of PRIDE/Guinee's operating costs
which meant that the organization was able to place quite a substantial amount
into reserves "for a rainy day." That "rainy day" has arrived, and during the
current budget crisis, PRIDE/Guinee has had to use these reserves and eamed
income (interest, training fees, etc.) to finance the organization.
"Participant Training" funds provided by USAD are not included in PRIDE/Guin6e's budget. TI-si*
are generally supplementary funds provided uniquely for training of staff of projects financed t
USAID.

Problems Encountered
PRIDE/Guinee has the same basic problems that face Credit Rural, i.e.,
difficulties in attaining break-even, growing loan delinquency, difficulty in
recovering embezzled funds attributable to uncooperative local authorities, the
need for a greatly improved legal and regulatory framework, etc. However,
PRIDE/Guinee has been able to avoid one of Credit Rural's greatest problems,
i.e., the "fatigue" of elected committee members. Theay've accomplished this by
limiting committee members' role, and in placing the decision to grant a loan
squarely in the hands of the loan officers, who are held accountable later on for
sour loans. Thus, committee members are no longer ,nvolved on a day-to-day
basis in the management of the organization. PRIDE/Guinee is, then, moving
more towards a capitalistic organizational structure, as opposed to the move
towards a mutual structure at Credit Rural. Another problem common to
PRIDElGuinee and Credit Rural is the difficulty encouintered in institutionalizing
the project. One foreign "expert" advised them to adopt a complicated structure
involving branches that would eventually become linancial cooperatives, i.e.,
credit unions. Other parties have encouraged them to become a mutual savings
bank. A consensus seems to be building for moving in the "mutual" direction,
although not entirely, since their planned branches would remain as profit
centers, without ever becoming individual independent caisses. As previously
mentioned, the "Business Training" part of the oirganization is becoming a
separate NGO; of that they are sure, even if they're not sure how the financial
institution's structure will turn out.
Prospects for Collaboration with Other DFSs:
According to Mr. Kimball, PRIDE/Guinee would be quite interested in the
possibility of a joint CFD/World Bank project, but the extent of their interest
would depend on current negotiations with USAID on continued funding of
PRIDE/Guinee. He recognizes, particularly, the utility of the presence of the
Bank, which would be much more able to persuade Guinean authorities to
accept certain needed reforms in the DFS sector. He also sees other areas of
collaboration and coordination, such as joint training programs, comparative
"best practices" type studies of various aspects of Guinea's DFS's, creating
some degree of uniformity in the various DFS's' MIS's and financial and
statistical reporting formats, and participation in the process of designing
appropriate new DFS legislation. PRIDElGuinee is currently hard at work
drafting a new five year development plan, which should be completed by
December 31, 1997 (the current USAID project end,s in April, 1999). They are
counting heavily on USAID, and hope that the latteir will finance ca large part of
their future development. Regardless, they would welcome a CFD/World Bank
team in early 1998 to study in detail how.CFD, the World Bank and the other
DFS's could best collaborate. Depending on the outcome of negotiations with
USAID, PRIDE/Guinee could very much be interested in a World Bank-funded
project, particularly if it were in the following domains: training (in-country and
overseas), technical assistance, new lines of credit, and improving their already
powerful MIS.

Microfinance Capacity-Building Project
Procurement and Disbursement Arrangements
Procurement
Guinea's procurement code was revised in 1997 in consultation with the Bank and is generally sound. No
special exemptions, permits, or licenses need to be specified in credit documents for international
competitive bidding, because Guinea allows Bank procedures to take precedence over any contrary local
regulations or uses. Procedures for national competitive bidding in Guinea are normally acceptable; the
government will give assurance during negotiations that systematically under national competitive bidding
(a) any bidders will be given sufficient time to submit bids (three to four weeks for contracts exceeding
US$20,000 equivalent); (b) bid evaluation and bidder qualifications will be clearly specified; (c) no
preference margin will be granted to domestic contractors or manufacturers; (d) eligible foreign firms will
not be precluded from participation; (e) contracts will provide for security in an amount sufficient to
protect the borrower in case of breach of contract (without distinction or exception); (f) prior to issuing the
first call for bids, draft standard bidding documents will be submitted to IDA and found acceptable; and (g)
award will be made to the lowest evaluated bidder.
Goods and works are to be procured in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under
IBRD loans and IDA credits, January 1995, revised January and August 1996. Consulting services,
technical assistance, and training will be procured in accordance with the Guidelines--Selection and
Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, January 1997. The Bank's standard form for
requests for proposals for consultant services and standard consultant contracts will be used for
procurement.
Procurement methods (table A)
Contracts for consulting services. Short lists for contracts estimated to cost less than US$0. 1 million may
be comprised entirely of national consultants if a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are
available at competitive costs. Simplified contracts will be used for short-term assignments-those not
exceeding six months-carried out by firms or by individual consultants.
Two long-term consulting contracts will be financed under the project.
*  The advisor to the Microfinance Support and Monitoring Unit, who will be procured as an individual
using the individual consultant selection method indicated in the guidelines (requiring a comparison of
three curriculum vitas). The total amount of this three-year contract will be US$0.8 million.
*  One firm will be hired to provide long-term and short-term advisory and consulting assistance for all
three microfinance institutions. The total amount of these contracts (estimated to cost a total of about
US$3.44 million) will be selected (Section II of the Guidelines) on the basis of quality- and cost-based
selection.
* Audit companies for the project (estimated to cost a total of about US$30,000 over the three-year
project period) will be selected through least-cost selection.

Traingi. For training abroad and in country, the program zontaining names of candidates, cost estimates,
courses, period of training, and institutions selected will be reviewed by IDA annually.
Contracts for goods. Contracts (totaling US$ 1.1 million) that cannot be grouped into packages of at least
US$50,000 each and are geographically scattered and spread over time will be procured through prudent
shopping based on price quotations obtained from at least three reliable suppliers. This process can be used
for small quantities of goods, provided that the aggregate amount does not exceed US$350,000 for
international shopping and US$750,000 for local shopping.
Prior review thresholds (table B). IDA-financed contracts for goods above the threshold value of US$50,000
equivalent will be subject to IDA's prior review procedures. Bank staff will also review the selection process
for hiring consultants proposed by the borrower. Prior IDA review will include the review of budgets, short
lists, selection procedures, requests for proposals, evaluation reports, and negotiated contracts. However, prior
IDA review will not apply to contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost
less than US$100,000 and US$50,000 equivalent, respectively. The exemption from prior IDA review will not
apply to the Terms of Reference of such contracts, regardless of their value, for single-source hiring, to
assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA, or to amendments of contracts raising the contract value
above the prior review thresholds. For consultant contracts estimated above US$150,000, opening the financial
envelopes will not take place prior to receiving the Bank's no-objection to the technical evaluation. For
contracts estimated to cost less than US$150,000, the borrower will notify IDA of the results of the technical
evaluation prior to opening the financial proposals. Documents related to procurement below the prior review
thresholds will be maintained by the borrower for ex post review by auditors and by IDA supervision missions.
Selective ex post review of contracts awarded below the threshold levels will apply to about one in three
contracts. The prior review process will cover about 90 percent of the total value of the amount contracted for
consultant services, while contracts for goods will normally be subject to ex post review only.
Modification or waiver of the scope and conditions of contracts. Before agreeing to any material extension,
or any modification or waiver of the conditions of contracts, that would increase in aggregate its cost by
more than 15 percent of the original price, the borrower should specify the reasons thereof and seek IDA's
prior no-objection for the proposed modification.
Procurement status of ongoing projects and proposed arrangements. National bidding procedures for public
sector procurement in Guinea have recently improved, but practices are still slow under several ongoing IDA-
financed projects. A revised procurement code was issued in 1997. The introduction of simplified procedures
and training of staff, which have been supported under an Institutional Development Facility grant, would
normally improve the current situation. Procurement will be managed by the MSMU, which will hire the
services of a procurement specialist to prepare the annual procurement for the microfinance institutions and to
handle more complex procurement cases. The MSMU will also send the administrative staff for procurement
training at the Bank-sponsored session at CESAG in Dakar.
Assurances. Assurances will be provided at negotiations that during annual reviews, an assessment of the
effectiveness of bidding procedures and performance will be carried out as they relate to the programn's
procurement experience and, if necessary, that modifications to the current procedures will be proposed for
IDA's consideration to the extent that they would accelerate procurement, while still maintaining adequate
control over contract awards and payments.
During appraisal. the government will submit (a) a draft procurement plan for the first two project years, (b) a
draft Project Implementation Manual including target time periods for the variours procurement phases, and (c)
a proposal to select a firm to provide advisory services to microfinance institutions. During negotiations,



Pap s3
agreement will be reached on the proper monitoring of procurement. The government will give assurance at
negotiations that it will (a) use the Project Inplementation Manual for program management and
implementation, (b) use the Bank's standard request for proposal to select consultants, (c) apply the
procurement procedures and arrangements outlined in the above documents, and (d) update the procurement
plan and procurement arrangements semiannually and at the annual review with IDA. The government will
submit a final version of the Project Implementation Manual before negotiations. During implementation, all
bidding documents, bid evaluation reports, and draft contracts transmitted to IDA for review will contain an
updated copy of the procurement plan. Procurement information will be collected and recorded as follows:
* Prompt recording of contract award information by the borrower
*  Semiannual reports to the Bank by the borrower indicating (a) revised cost estimates for individual contracts
and the total program, including best estimates of allowances for contingencies, (b) revised timing of
estimated procurement actions, including experience with completion time and completion costs for individual
contracts, and (c) compliance with aggregate limits on specified nnethods of procurement.
A detailed procurement plan for goods and services to be procured under the first two years will be prepared as
part of the Project Implementation Manual. It will be approved durini; negotiations and updated on a regular
basis during annual reviews to compare target times and actual compl[etion . The government will give
assurance at negotiations that it will take the necessary measures to ensure that procurement phases do not
exceed the following target time periods:
Procurement phases                Maximum rnumber of weeks
Preparation of bidding documents  4 (6 for large contracts)
Preparation of bids by bidders    4 (6-10 for international competitive bidding)
Evaluation of bids                2 (4 for large contracts)
Signature of contracts            2
Payments                          3
Disbursements
Allocation of loan proceeds (table C). Disbursements will cover 100%/, of consultant services and training
procured under the project and 100% of vehicle and equipment costs.
Use of statements of expenses. Due to the numerous small disbursements expected under the project,
disbursements for (a) goods under contracts costing less than US$200,000, (b) services under contracts
with consulting firns costing less than US$100,000 each, and (c) contracts with individual consultants
costing less than US$50,000 each will be made against a certified statement of expernditure, for which
appropriate documentation will be retained by the Microfinance Support and Coordination Unit.
Special account. To facilitate project implementation, the borrower will establish a special account in one
of the major foreign commercial banks on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank to cover the Bank's
share of expenditures. The authorized allocation will be US$0.5 million, representing about four months of
average expenditures made through the special account. Applications for replenishmnent of the special
account will be submitted monthly or when one-third of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs
earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment will follow standard Bank procedures as described
in Disbursement Handbook, chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the special account that have been
reconciled by the borrower will accompany all replenishment requests.

The proposed IDA Credit will be disbursed over five years according to the categories shown in Annex 5,
Table C.
Accounts, Audits, and Reporting
The MSMU and the three implementing institutions will each maintain separate accounts for the portion of
the program for which they are responsible. The MSMU will prepare the consolidated program accounts
and financial statements on the basis of the individual accounts. All procurement documents, contracts, and
invoices will also be maintained by the MSMU and made accessible to supervision missions and auditors.
During negotiations, the government will provide assurances (a) that program accounts will be audited in
accordance with international audit standards by experienced and internationally recognized audit firms
acceptable to IDA; the audit reports and related program accounts will be submitted to IDA within six
months after the end of the government's fiscal year, (b) that, in addition to their standard short-form report
with the opinion, the auditors will (i) carry out a comprehensive review of all (not a sample) the statements
of expenses, pertaining to the relevant period under audit, along with the internal control procedures
governing their preparation, and express a separate opinion thereon, (ii) review the management and use of
the special account and express a separate opinion thereon, and (iii) produce semiannual reports on
technical and management performance no later than three months after the end of the period under review,
and, finally, (c) that the auditor will perform an in-depth review of the internal control system of the
program with a view to identifying the major weaknesses and shortcomings and propose practical
recommendations for improvement. The results of this review will be documented in a Management Letter
to be submitted along with the audit reports.
Reporting. The MSMU will submit the following reports: (a) semiannual progress reports, (b) an annual
report and a proposed financing plan four weeks before the joint annual review and no later than September
30 each year, (c) a detailed progress report on technical and financial project activities no later than four
weeks before the date of mid-term review, and (d) an implementation completion report three months before
the closing date.
SuDervision. The program will require intensive supervision during the start-up phase when implementation
arrangements are put to the test. The first full IDA supervision mission will take the form of a program
launch workshop at least three months before the beginning of the government fiscal year on January I to
establish the annual review cycle. In addition to the first annual review meeting, two supervision missions
will be scheduled during the fiscal year to monitor progress and coordinate with government. A mid-term
review, including a full technical and financial audit of the program, will be conducted between June and
December 2000, and an end-of-program evaluation will be performed during year three of the project. The
project will be supervised every four months the first year, then every six months thereafter. Supervision
missions will consist of field trips to review financial and management practices, bidding, and payments
procedures. Supervision missions will also carefully monitor the performance of model caisses and the
lessons learned from their development, the development of skills among staff and elected officials, as well
as overall progress made by each institution in meeting its performance targets. A detailed supervision plan
is reflected in the Project Implementation Manual.
