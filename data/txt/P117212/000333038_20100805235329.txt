                              RESTRUCTURING PAPER



   SUMMARY
This Project Paper seeks the approval of the Country Director for the restructuring of the
Zimbabwe Emergency Agricultural Input Project (TF095035) approved by the RVP on
July 30, 2009, which became effective on September 3, 2009.

The original project development objective is to increase access to improved seeds
among 300,000 smallholder farmers farming in targeted food-insecure communal lands
of Zimbabwe. These farmers were successfully assisted during the 2009/10 cropping
season. The project has contributed to reducing the country's dependence on expensive
grain imports and food aid.

However, drought affected parts of the country in 2009/10 and many households remain
dependent on external assistance. The restructuring will allow a second year of maize
seed purchases and distribution to be completed with savings obtained from the
unexpectedly low cost of maize seed purchased in 2009. An additional 45,000 farmers
will again be provided an allocation of 10 kg of improved maize seed.

This requires a small change in the original budget allocation. There will also be an
upward adjustment in the performance indicators to account for the additional seed
allocation.

The grant is financed by the Food Price Crisis Response Core Multi-Donor Trust Fund.
The project is being implemented by GRM International Limited, a UK company which
manages the Protracted Relief Programme jointly funded by DFID, Australia, the
Netherlands and the European Union. This assures implementation by a well
experienced management entity working with a strong set of NGO partners.




   PROJECT STATUS
The overall status of project implementation has been rated satisfactory. The targets for
maize seed delivery to small-scale farmers both through direct distribution, and through
voucher based distribution, were exceeded. Initial results from the impact assessment
indicate most of this seed was planted. While drought has affected grain yields in some
parts of the country, we anticipate the project has, nonetheless, contributed a significant
net increment in household maize production and food security.

The budget status is as follows:

    PROPOSED CHANGES
The restructuring will allow the reallocation of US$238,000 from Component 1 (Goods
and services for seed and voucher delivery) to Component 2 (Operating costs and
services for evaluation) in order to cover the extra administrative and evaluation costs
associated with the purchase and distribution of an additional 450 tons of maize seed to
45,000 households. These expenses include the costs of GRM management, seed
procurement, seed testing, audit and an additional year of impact assessment.

The proposed changes will be as follows:

   Results/indicators
    The results indicators summarized in Annex 1 have been amended to account for the
    additional quantity of seed being distributed, and the additional number of
    beneficiaries. Correspondingly, the area planted with improved maize seed will also
    increase. No other changes are anticipated.

   Components:
    Under Component One, an additional quantity of at least 450 tons of maize seed will
    be purchased and distributed to at least 45,000 additional smallholder farmers through
    the use of voucher based distribution, as successfully applied in the first year of the
    project. There are no substantive changes in the methods of purchase or distribution
    of this seed.

    Under Component Two, the only substantive change is there will be a second year of
    impact evaluation.

        Procurement
       The project will procure an additional 450 tons of maize seed, and the voucher
       distribution and collection services congruent with this commitment. This includes
       the contracting of NGO assistance in the identification of target beneficiaries. In
       addition, the project will procure one additional impact assessment to assess the
       second year of seed distribution. Finally, the original procurement plan ends in
       December 2010. This will be extended to June 2011. The details of this procurement
       plan are found in Annex 3 which specifically covers the period from April 2010 to
       June 2011.

    If the project has had a previous restructuring, the current should reflect the latest approved costs.

3.     Briefly summarize project implementation progress.

The overall status of project implementation has been rated satisfactory. The targets for
maize seed delivery to small-scale farmers both through direct distribution, and through
voucher based distribution, were exceeded. Initial results from the impact assessment
indicate most of this seed was planted. While drought has affected grain yields in some
parts of the country, we anticipate the project has, nonetheless, contributed a significant
net increment in household maize production and food security.


4.     The proposed reallocation is necessary to distribute at least 450 tons of additional
maize seed to at least 45,000 additional smallholder farmers in targeted Communal
Lands. In addition, the reallocation will allow a second year of impact assessment.

           should be noted:

       a. The NGOs would be selected under single source procedures for the following
          reasons. The method and procedures that GRM used for the selection of NGOs for
          activities financed by DFID under the PRP I and PRP II were reviewed and found
          to be satisfactory by the World Bank. Specifically, under the PRP, pre-proposals
          were solicited by GRM from any NGO interested in providing the requisite
          services. GRM conducted a review of the pre-proposals and identified a list of
          NGOs meeting the preliminary qualification criteria. These NGOs were requested
          to submit more detailed proposals and GRM evaluated them and selected 20 as
          qualified to undertake the tasks required under the PRP. These tasks are similar to
          those that would be performed under the project. The NGOs to be contracted,
          individually, under the ZEAIP will be drawn from amongst the same 20.

       b. Although not currently planned under this project, Service Delivery Contracts,
          Fee Based Selection (FBS) and Quality Based Selection (QBS) may also be used
          for the procurement of goods and consultants.
