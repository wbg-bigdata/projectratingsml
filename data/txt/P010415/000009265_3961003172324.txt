EORRANDUM AND RECOMMEDUTION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTMRNATIONAL DEVELOPIMT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EECUTI  DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT
TO THE ISLAMC REPUBLIC OF PAKISTAN
FOR A 1992 FLOOD DANAGE RESTORATION PROJECT
1.        I submit for your approval the following mmorandum and recommendation
on a proposed development credit to the Islamic Republic of Pakistan for SDR 72.8
million (US$100.0 million equivalent). The proposed credit would help finance
the priority investment requirements of rehab:.litation and reconstruction of
public infrastructure affected by the 1992 flood disaster. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms, with a maturity of 35 years with 10 years grace.
The project would be cofinanced by the Asian Development ank (ADB) for US$1.00.0
million equivalent. The proceeds of the IDA credit will be retained partly by
the Government of Pakistan (GOP) for use by the Federal Flood Commission with the
rest being made available to the National Highway Authority, the Provinces and
Azad Jammu and Kashmir, through budgetary allocations on a first-come-first-serve
basis (based on implementation performance and credit utilization).
2.        Countr=lSector Backaround.  The Islamic Republic of Pakistan covers
an area of about 780,000 sq km subdivided into four provinces: Balochistan,
North West Frontier (NWFP), Punjab and Sindh, and Azad Jamm. and Kashmir (AJK).
Pakistan's population is estimated at about 116.0 million (1991) and is growing
at an annual rate of 3.12. Per capita GNP was US$410, with about 301 of the
population having an income below the absolute poverty line.
3.        With the exception of the steep mountains and hills in the north, most
of Pakistan is either arid or semi-arid. Although the mean annual precipitation
is about 600 me, rainfall is erratic and much of the Indus Plains, where crop
cultivation is concentrated, receives an average of less than 150 mm per annum.
Hence, irrigation is essential for most agricultural production. About 901 of
the value of agricultural production comes from the 16 million ha of irrigated
land.
4.        Floods in Pakistan occur most frequently and are more extensive and
damaging in the Indus Plains, but have recently become more devastating in the
north due to the cumulative changes in hydrological and topographic conditions
that have occurred there. Floods in the Indus Plains are mainly caused by
spillage from rivers during high flows generated in the upper catchment areas of
the Himalayas and Koh-Hindu-Kush. However, in the north during July and August
when the heavy rainfall coincides with the peak from snow-melt, catchment areas
of rivers experience rapid buildup of exceptionally heavy flows and carry large
sediment loads which create erosion and flooding. A considerable part of these
catchment areas and riverbeds with stesp gradients and limited valley storage are
in the north and outside Pakistan's national boundaries.
5.        Rivers in the Indus Plains are prone to channel degradation, and
gradual rise In the elevation of river beds which also leads to the deterioration
of their capacity to carry high flows. This Is a natural characteristic that to
some extent has been intensified by heavy withdrawals for irrigation and the
construction of storage reservoirs and diversion barrages. About half the annual



discharges of the Indus and its tributaries are diverted in Pakistan into one of
the world's largest contiguous irrigation canal systems. In this system, some
33 million acres of the Indus Plains are served by about 38,000 miles of canals
and by two major storage dams: Mangla Cam on the Jhelum River and Tarbels Dam on
the Indus. Other key components of the system are 17 major irrigation barrages.
6.        Flood protection works have been constructed in Pakistan over several
generations; there exist more than 3,000 miles of flood protection embankments
and numerous spurs and river training structures. Major dams in upper catebment
areas of the Indus tributaries, together with the detention reservoirs and
diversion works have been successfully utilized to protect against flash floods
and to minimize flood damage during past decades. Even so, serious damage from
exceptionally high flows still occur due to overtopping and/or breaching of
protective works. Since 1948, exceptionally high flood flows (in excess of
800,000 cusecs) have been recorded eight timeslJ at various gauging stations at
the five major barrages on the Indus River.
7.        The 1992 Floods. During the 1992 monsoon season, Pakistan experienced
exceptionally hea-'y rainfall which resulted in widespread floods in many parts
of the country. The heavy rains in August saturated soils over much of the
catchment area, leaving little capacity to absorb additional moisture. As a
result, when additional torrential rains occurred in the north on September 8 and
9, 1992 the runoff began almost immediately causing flash floods. The resulting
torrents caused unprecedented flows in the Jhelum and Chenab Rivers in Punjab
province and in the Indus River and its smaller tributaries. Conditions were
exacerbated because storage capacity at the major dams and detention reservoirs
was already fully utilized. The results were serious flooding and landslides
that would have caused serious damage under any circumstances. According to
Federal  Flood  Commission  records,  the  flood  peaks  were  classified  as
"exceptionally high" throughout the Jhelum and Chenab Rivers and on the main stem
of the Indus River, between its confluence with the Chenab and Sukkur barrage.
Elsewhere along the Indus, the recorded peaks were in the "very high" category.
The peak at Mangla Dam on the Jhelum River represents an unusually high flood
with a recurrence interval of between 40 and 50 years, or  with 2S to 2.51
probability of occurring in any year.
8.         During the floods, the Federal Flood Warning Center (FFWC) and Flood
Control Center (FCC) issued flood forecasts and warnings and thousands of people
were evacuated in time from the flood-affected areas preventing what could have
been an even greater disaster in terms of the loss of life.  However, because
PFWC's forecasting capability is at present impaired by the poor condition of the
telemetry system which has outlived its useful life and by the inherent
shortcomings of the two weather radars currently in operation, it was impossible
to prepare accurate flood forecasts before, during and immediately after the
heavy rainfall. If the telemetry system had been fully operational and if more
suitable weather radar and up-to-date flood routing techniques were available,
the loss of life probably could have been even much less than it was.
Replacement and upgrading of the telemetry system and the procurement of more
suitable weather radar is being carried out under the ongoing ADB-financed Flood
Protection Sector Project.
1/        Including 1992, with record flows of 1.0 million cusecs.



9.        Assessment of Flood Damage.  The floods affected all four provinces
as well as the northern areas and resulted in considerable loss of life,
widespread damage to crops, infrastructure and property.   The heavy rains,
landslides and inundations destroyed or severely damaged over 9609000 houses and
affected about 4.8 million inhabitants (reportedly 1,200 people lost their
lives). Government estimates of the impact of the flood indicate total damages
of US$2.4 billion equivalent, of which about US$1.9 billion is for loss ot domage
to the private sector (such as physical assets, crops, and livestock) and US$0.5
billion for loss and damage to public infrastructure. The sector hardeat hit by
the floods was agricultura, with substantial losses in cotton, sugarci.ne, and
rice. Estimates of crop damage indicate a decline in output between 4 to 7X.
Damage to infrastructure disrupted transportation and essential public services.
Highways were flooded or blocked by landslides, a number of bridges were
destroyed or damaged, and about 900 miles of irrigation canals and water channels
were badly damaged.
10.       The impact of the floods has also worsened the economic outlook for
the current fiscal year. GDP growth is projected to be 1.5X lower and reach only
about  4.72.    Expenditures  for  relief  operations  and  rehabilitation  of
infrastructure, combined with revenue shortfalls, are expected to increase the
budget deficit by 0.6 to 0.81 of GDP.  In the absence of further measures, the
overall fiscal deficit would reach 7.8-8.0X of GDP.  %n  the monetary side,
incremental financing requirements for commodity operations, extension of credit
for recovery of agricultural activities, and higher public sector borrowing are
expected to increase the inflation rate from the targeted 81 to 11.52. The
direct balance of payments impact is estimated on the order of US$710 million,
of which an estimated US$465 million comes from losses in export receipts and
US$245 million from higher imports for flood relief and rehabilitation. The
current account deficit could increase to US$2.9 billion or 6.11 of GDP.  It is
clear that the effects of the flood have reinforced the need to tighten financial
policies to improve macroeconomic balances. The Government has recognized that
the primary impetus for restoring macroeconomic stability must come from domestic
policy efforts.  In this regard, discussions with the IMF and the. Bank are
continuing.
11.       International Surport. As soon as the magnitude of the damage by the
floods became apparent, the Government established a cabinet committee (chaired
by the Minister of the Environment and Urban Affairs) to coordinate relief and
damage rectification efforts. The Prime Minister established a flood relief fund
to which many international and local donors contributed. The international
community responded quickly to the flood events, 4n particular to relieve the
plight of those rendered homeless, and assistance was quickly provided or
cammitted. Most of the efforts were monitored by the Islamabad office of the
United Nations Devel-opment Programme (UNDP). As of October 31, 1992, the total
cash and material commitments registered by UNDP amounted to nearly $31 million
equivalent from bilateral and non-government organization sourcws. Twenty-seven
countries, the United Nations Disaster Relief Office, United Nations Children's
Pund and the International Federation of the Red Cross provided relief assistance
in the form of unvalued material supplies such as tents, blankets, food,
medicines and the use of helicopters and airlift facilities.
12.       In addition to proposed IDA support, Pakistan expects to receive
substantial other financial support for its rehabilitation and recovery effort
from Germany and Saudi Arabia. The International Monetary Fund is providing SDR



- 4 -
189.55 million (equivalent to about US$260 million) (252 of quota) under its
Emergency Assistance Facility approved by its Board on November 25, 1992. ADB,
which jointly appraised the proposed project with IDA, is also providing a loan
from its Special Funds resource' in an amount equivalent to US$100, to support
the reconstruction program (approved by the ADB Board on December 15, 1992).
13.       IDA's Resoonse.   In keeping vith IDA'. long-standing policy of
responding quickly to emergencies, the Bank's field office in Islamabad on
September 10, 1992 began monitoring the flood damage and liaising with potential
donors. After the Bank received a request from the Goverument for assistance in
late September, an Ad Hoc Advisory Group, drawing on expertise on emergency
operations from various parts of the Bank, was immediately established to advise
on project preparation and design matters. At this stage the Bank began to
liaise with ADB which subsequently received a similar request from the Government
for assistance. In October, ADB and IDA jo*ntly appraised the proposed project
(which both institutions negotiated in November, 1992 and January, 1993
respectively).
14.       Lessons Learned from Previous IDA Oserations. IDA experience with the
three previous flood restoration projectsl' has been largely successful.  In
general, all three projects (approved after floods during 1974, 1976 and 1988)
achieved their targets of restoring flood damaged infrastructure and assisting
in economic recovery. Further, each project contributed to reducing the impact
of subsequent floods. In the foreseeable future, improvement of the existing
flood protection system of levees or bunds along rivers is the only practical
means for protection against floods. (Appendix 1 provides an overview of the
three previous floods.) A technically better solution would be construction of
a system of reservoirs with sufficient capacity to provide storage and thus
control floods. However, there are limited possibilities for the construction
of such a complex system at reasonable cost, and no such development would appear
economically feasible in the near future. The nature of the works to be
undertaken under the proposed project is such that they would have little impact
on the overall risk of future damage caused by floods of the magnitude recently
experienced. Nevertheless, such works vould restore damaged infrastructure and
stimulate a return to normalcy as did previous flood damage restoration projects
financed by IDA.
15.       Major constraints experienced during the implementation of past
projects include occasional shortages of local funds during the early stages of
the implementation phase when special accounts were not yet operational. The
initial unfamiliarity of many field divisions with Implementation arrangements,
delays in preparing design and cost estimates and shortages in technical staff
also contributed to delays.   The overall performance of the provincial
implementing agencies was satisfactory considering that restoration works with
a total value of about US$85.0 million were executed under the IDA and ADB
financed 1988 Flood Damage Restoration Project within a period of 3-1/2 years.
Implementing agencies and consultants are now fully familiar with IDA and ADB

requirements which should help contribute to the successful implementation of the
proposed project. Retroactive finacing was of great be.aefit to the Goverment
during each of the three previous emergency recovery projects, and is also
proposed for this project.
16.         3aionJle for IDA Inolvement. The proposed assistance is a further
expression of IDA's comitment to the country in mseeting, its development
objectives generally, and to restoring its economic balance as rapidly as
possible with the least disruption. The assistance would anable the repair and
restoration of past investments, and the resumption to implementation of other
on-going proJects finanmed by IDA. Providing emergency assistance for the fourth
tim since x973 to repair damage caused by floods, would enable the Government
to build on pst ivestments, and would encourage continued Government csmmitment
to and improvement of flood mitigation measures already in place with funding to
be provided by the ADD.
17.       The economic and social infrastructure sectors in which assistance is
needed are critical to the country's well being, and are areas of long-standing
IDA involvement in Pakistan.  IDA's assistance would eaze the Government's
already constrained financial capabilities, and reduce the need to divert its own
limited resources from other priority projects and programs.
18.       Prolect Objectives.  The project's main objective is to assist the
Government in implementing a national program to restore vital infrastructure
destroyed or damaged in the 1992 flood in order to minimiie the disruption to
economic activity and social services. A sectoral approach to project design ha.
been adopted in order to respond flexibly a-d efficiently to the country's needs.
The project would also accelerate the start of sele.cted top priority works to
protect Investments in infrastructure that survived the 1992 flood.
19.       Prolect Descrl2tion. The proposed project comprises a three-year time
slice of the Government's "rogram to restore flood-damaged public infrastructure.
This program coveros (Part I) repair and restoration of federal and provincial
infrastructure, includings roads and bridges; irrigation, drainage and flood
protection works; and primary education and basic health facilities; and (Part
IY) restoration of infrstructure mainly provided by Government enterprises such
as railways, power, and telecommunications. While the Government has requested
external assistance for the first part, it intends to have the concerned public
enterprises assume most, if not all, of the burden for the second part.
20.       The selection of subprojects to be implemented under the project will
be draw  from Part I of the Goveoment's restoration program, with subprojects
to be selected and lmplemented in accordance with the criteria as set out in
Appendix 2. The scope of works and, in particular, restoration standards and
implementation arrangements, are defined in Appendix 3.  In principle, the
project would restore facilities to pre-1992 flood conditions but with allowances
for improvements when justified to ensure that the restored facilities meet
current environment, quality and efficiency standards.
21.       Pro3ect ImoleM=entaton.  The Federal Flood Commission (FPC) of the
GOP'. Ministry of Water and Power would be the Coordinating Agency for the
overall project. Implementing agencies responsible for implementation of their
respective parts of the project are:



(a)   National Highway Authority (MM) of GOP's Ministry of Communications
would be responsible for restoration of national highways under its
jurisdiction and certain selected works under the jurisdiction of the
provincial authorities.
(b)   Provincial Departments of Communications and Works (CWDs) would be
respon.Able for restoration of provincial and district (farm-to-
market) roads under their jurisdiction, and of basic health facilities
in their respective provinces and AJK; and in NWFP and AJK for
restoration of primary education facilities as well.
(c)   Provincial Departments of Irrigation (PIDs) would be responsible for
restoration of irrigation, drainage, flood control, and river training
facilities in their respective provinces.
(d)   Provincial Departments of Education (PEDs) would be responsible for
restoration of primary education facilities in Punjab and Sindh.
22.       A Provincial Flood Damage Restoration Cell (PFDRC) would coordinate
overall project implementation for each province.   In addition, a firm of
consultants will be engaged under the project to assist the FFC and the
implementing agencies. The responsibilities of the implementing agencies and an
outline of terms of reference for the consulting services are shown in
Appendix 4.
23.       Pro2ram Cost and Proposed Financint Plan.   Total program cost is
estimated at US$483.4 million equivalent, of which US$397.2 million is for Part
I and US$86.2 million for Part II of the Government's program. The foreign
exchagne component is about US$119.8 million equivalent (302) and taxes and
duties are estimated at about US$40.0 million equivalent. The IDA credit of
US$100.0 million equivalent and ADB's contribution of a similar amount would
finance  about 50X of the cost of Part I.  In addition, funds (about US$50
million) from existing World Bank/IDA-financed ongoing projects, with scopes of
work that already cover the types of activities to be supported under the
proposed project, will be utilized for the flood recovery program. The balance
would be provided by the Government and other potential donors. A breakdown of
project costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule A.  Amounts and
methods of procurement and of disbursements, and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status
of Bank Group operations in Pakistan are presented in Schedules C and D,
respectively. A map is also attached, and a Technical Annex is provided in lieu
of a Staff Appraisal Report.
24.       Retroactive Financing.  Because of the emergency nature of the work
which required an immediate response, and the critical need for IDA assistance,
retroactive financing would be provided to restore vital services, for
expenditures incurred on project activities since September 10, 1992 when the
IDA, through its field office in Islamabad, first became actively involved in
assisting the Government. Certain emergency works for which contracts have
already been entered into and works have already been carried out will be
revieied by IDA on a case-by-case basis for eligibility for retroactive
financing. Works undertaken as an interim measure to rrovide temporary repair
to damaged infrastructure will not be eligible for retroactive financing. It is



- 7 -
anticipated that the total expenditure -ligible for retroactive financing will
not exceed US$20.0 million or 202 of the credit amount.
25.       Proiect Sustainabilitv.   Effective operation of flood monitoring
systems, both within Pakistan and in collaboration with India, is essential for
the sustained operation of restored structures. Because the flood flows take
several days to reach the downstream areas most vulnerable to flooding, early
warning systems can play a major role in reducing future flood damage.
Improvement of flood mitigation measures, already put in place urder ADB's
ongoing Flood Protection Sector Project (approved after the 1988 flood)9 would
provide for an upgraded and improved telemetry system, at an estimated cost of
US$10.0 million (Appendix 6).   The improved system would provide greater
capabilities for flood forecasting and warning systems in the catchments of the
Indus River and its tributaries. In addition, complementary technical assistance
will include floodplain mapping, consideration of floodplain zoning, preparation
of a flood preparedness manual and other non-structural measures to prevent flood
damage. Because the Government has requested ADB to secure grant financing for
these improvements, no additional components for flood mitigation have been
included in the IDA credit.
26.       Agreed Actions.   Selection criteria,  scope of work, restoration
standards, and implementation and procurement arrangements, which are si!ilar to
those agreed between GOP and ADB, have been agreed with Government and were
reconfirmed during negotiations.   The following actions are conditions of
effectiveness: (a) the Planning Commission's Proforma 1 (Umbrella PC-1) for the
project would be approved by the Government's Executive Committee of the National
Economic Councill (b) the FFC will have signed a contract vith the project
consultant,; and (e) all conditions for effectiveness of the ADB loan will have
been satisfied.
27.       Environmental Aspects.   The project would have strongly positive
socio-economic impacts by contributing to the restoration of transportation
service, egricultural productivity, flood protection, education and health eare
to pre-disaster levels.   It will be neutral in its impact on the natural
environment, which realistically can only be restored by natural processes. A
fundamental issue is the need to reduce the hazard of damage and loss of life
from future floods and rain-induced landslides which is being addressed by ADB.
There is urgent need to address these objectives over the long-term in a niational
forest conservation/management strategy. Local positive impacts can be obtained
from provisions to improve storm drainage, erosion control and resistance to
flood damage in restoration designs. The potential negative impacts are also
local--primarily those associated with earthmoving, demolition and construction
during restoration of civil works. For virtually all the facilities to be
restored no significant resettlement is involved. If resettlement is required
for some facilities, then IDA would require the necessary studies and
consultative process to be carried out before any decisions are takon. The
project has been rated a "B" based on a limited environmental assessment carried
out during project appraisal.
28.       Progect Benefits.  The primary emphasis of the project is to restore
the pre-flood capacities of critical infrastructure by linking damaged portions
to undamaged portions, and making entire systems (i.e.9 irrigation, drainage,
flood control and roads) operational again.   The project will also restore
primary education facilities and basic health facilities lost in the flood. In



- 8 -
view of the substantial sunk cost in most of thooo facilitiea, these lnvestments
have high rates of economic and social return.  A. a result of the project,
growth of the agriculture sector should return to average pre-flood annul
levels. In fact, the deposition of silt ovea large areas of agricultural land
could provide extra fertility during the next few crop seasons .  The main
beneficiaries of the project will be the rural pe'ple who vere most affected by
the floods and who rely mainly on agriculture and on farm to arket linkages by
means of the road infrastruccure for their livelihood. The restoration of bsic
education and health services in rural areas will also mainly benefit village
dwellers whose social indicators are the worat in Pakistan.
29.       Rlaka.  The risks to successful implementation of the project, such
as insufficient goverrnent budgetary allocation or poor performance of the
implementing agencies, are considered manageable. The Government has reiterated
its high priority for the program and has already initiated restoration meaures
vith its own resources. In addition, the performance of PFC9 as the coordingatng
agency, and that of the Implementing agencies in executing the 1988 Flood Damage
Restoration Project, was quite satisfactory, indicating that the implementation
arrangements proposed for this projvct are sound. In addition, these agencies
will be strongly supported by consultants whose performance under the previous
project was also satisfactory. Finally, while the statistical probabilities are
remote, the recurrence of exceptional floods cannot be ruled out.   The
improvements proposed in flood forecasting and flood warning should ensure that
flood damage to the economy as well as loss of life would be less in the future.
The Federal Government and the provinces have already made a significant start
in this direction and have given the highest priority to restoring flood damaged
infrastructure. Therefore, project risks are considered to be small.
30.       Some of the facilities to be restored under the proposed project are
located in AJK, an area over which India and Pakistan bave been In dispute since
1947. By includitg finanee for those facilities In the proposed credit, IDA does
not intend thereby to prejudice the detemination of the claim  of the parties
to the dispute.
31.       Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed development credit
would comply with the Articles of Agreemet of the Association and recomsund that
the Executive Directors approve the proposed credit.

1992 FLOOD DAMAGE RESTORATION PROJECT
Technical Annex
I. BACKGROUN
1.1       Monsoon Season.  In Pakistan, the monsoon season stretches from end-
June to mid-September vith the heaviest rains falling during the months of July
and August. It is during these two months that the northern part of the country,
the catcement area of all the major rivers in the country, receives one-third to
one half of Its annual rainfall. Consequently, it Is during these months that
the rain water through major rivers is collected in reservoirs of the dams to be
used for irrigation and power generation during the year.  In August 1992,
exceptionally heavy rains, and the resulting floods, caused extensive damage to
crops and livestock in Sindh. This damage, however, was much less than the
destruction caused by the super flood which originated in the north of the
country during the second week of September and devastated a substantial portion
of the rural country side by ravaging thousands cf villages (and some cities),
destroying standing crops on millions of acres and badly damaging transport,
communication and irrigation infrastructure throughout the entire length of the
country.
1.2       The 1992 Floods.  On September 8, 1992, a low pressure area moving
from Rajasthan in India in the south-east and a strong east moving depression
coming from the west met over Kashmir and dropped more than 52 cms (20 inches)
of rain during a period of 36 hours in the catchment areas of the Jhelum and
Chenab rivers. This extreme phenomenon, coupled with the past high degree of
deforestation, resulted in flash floods in many areas of AJK and caused extensive
damage to the state's already fragile communication system. Within 48 hours,
almost all the major bridges were destroyed and the road network was badly
damaged by a large number of mud and rockslides. In addition, continued heavy
rains in the area caused a state of super flood in the Jhelum River (and a
tributary 'f Jhelum--Poonch River) upstream from Mangla Dam.  Similarly, heavy
rains in the DWPP caused extensive damage to the communication network in that
province. Worst hit in that province were the districts of Mansehra, Hazara and
D.I. Khan.
1.3       ODeration of Manjla Dam. Mangla Dam is located in the Jhelum district
of Punjab on the Jhelum River. It has a total storage capacity of about 5.4 maf
of water and an installed capacity of 800 megawatts of electricity. Although
initial heavy inflows into the Mangla reservoir were easily accommodated, an
unexpected second flood peak forced WAPDA to discharge an enormous amount of
water into the downstream river system. This huge outflow greatly accentuated
the already critical flood situation. These developments are explained in more
detail below.
1.4       By end-August, the Mangla Dam's reservoir was already up to the level
generally believed to be sufficient for annual irrigation and power needs
(elevation of 1,202 feet above the sea level). Apparently due to the weak
telemetric and inadequate flood forecasting system (a problem compounded by the
fact that more than half of the catchment area falls under Indian control), WAPDA
had little advance knowledge about the amount of water that would be flowing into



- 19 -
the Mangla reservoir on September 9 and 10.  encoe, &A   continued to discharge
water from the reservoir at a eteady rate of about 33 thoussad cusses, the
minimum amount required to generate electricity from the Dem. This rate of
outflow from the reservoir contliued even after the Inflow into the reservoir
intreased four-fold in the pro-dawn hours of September 9.
1.5       It was only after 9 a.m., when the Inflow of water increased to 315
thousand cusecs (ten times the normal flow) that WAPDA Increased the outflow to
184 thousand cussecs. But in the next few hours, the inflow of water increased
to a super flood level and at 5 p.m. the first peak of about 1 million cusecs
entered the reservoir. The Inflow, however, gredually decreased to 560 thousand
cusecs by maid-night of September 9. Considering this heavy Inflow to be a
temporary phenomenon, WAPDA authorities tried to maage the downstream flood by
gradually increasing the outflow from 246 thousand cusses at 5 p.m. to 645
thousand cusecs at maid-night of September 9, consequently raising the water level
in the reservoir to 1,208 feet above the sea level. However, the Inflow of water
increased again and a second peak was reacebd (more then 1 million cuseCs entered
the reservoir) at 4 a.m. on September 10.
1.6       In order to protect the structure from the risk of a possible third
peak, WAPDA decided to lower the level of water in the reservoir (from 1208 feet)
and it increased the discharge to an average of 884 thousand cusecs for the next
10 hours--thus releasing about 263 billion cubic feet of water, downstream into
the Jhelum. The injection of this amount of water (with an additional amount of
200,000 to 300,000 cusees of rain water froa the flood and other drains) caused
a surge in the water level of the Jhelum River and transmitted a major flood wave
throughout the length of the riverain system. It was this wave that made the
1992 flood the worst flood in country's history aud caused enornu damage to
life and property.
1.7       Flood DjmMj s.  The surge In water level caused by tho outflows from
Mangla was too big to be contained by the protective river embankments and to be
managed by the irrigation barrages and headworks. Renee, the water spilled over
from the embankments inundating large areas, including agricultural lands with
standing crops. At some places, the rushing waters caused breaches in the
protective embankmets, while at other places breaches were deliberately made by
the civil and military authorities to minimize damage to the irrigation system
and/or to protect major cities from floods, thus causin further inundation of
large tracts of rural areas.
1.8       Economic  Imuact.   The damage  to  infrastructure  has  disrupted
transportation and essential public services. Highways were flooded or blocked
by landslides, and a number of bridges were destroyed or badly damaged. Railway
transport, telecomdunlcation and power supply were disrupted temporarily. While
the damage to telecommunication facilities, power Installations and the railways
was less severe, highways and bridges require a substantial reconstruction
effort.
1.9       Substantial damage also occurred to the Irrigation canals in Punjab.
About 900 miles of irrigation canals and vater channls  were badly dmaged.
Rushing vaters caused breaches in the protective embankments, flood cont-ol and
river training structures. At other places, breaches were made by the civil and
military authorities to dininize damage to the Irrigation barrages, headworks and
their ancillary structures, highways and bridges and to protect major cities from



- 20 -
floods. Although no sajor headworks we-re damaged, embankements must be restored
and tubewell etations that suffered from Inundation, must be made operational
again.
1.10      The sector hardest hit by the flood vas agriculture.  At least 1.9
million bales of cottont four million tons of sugarcane and 0.5 million tons of
rice were lost due to inundation. Wheat-Pakistan's fourth most Important crop--
was not affected as it is soon only in late autumn. In fact, it is expected that
the wheat crop will be bigger than in the previous fiscal year and thus
compensate to so=e extent for the overall loss in agricultural production.
However, substantial stocks from last year's output have been damaged. Estimates
of major crop damage Indicate a decline in output between -4 and -7Z, and
agricultural growth in other crops and livestock will be significantly lower than
expected. This translates into a negative growth contribution to GDP for the
agricultural sector as a whole.
1.11      The Impact on the manufacturing sector is more difficult to estimate.
Some subsectors hae been affected directly by the floods, such as cotton
ginning, cement, etc. Others suffer indirectly from the scarcity of agricultural
Inputs and disruptions of communication. Whereas manufacturing output will
experience a loer rate of growth, the construction industry is oepected to
benefit. Within the Industrial sector, the increase in construction activities
will probably compensate for production losses in manufacturing. Losses in the
services sectors, especialy retail, are not pervasive and recovery will be
relatively fast, so that the shortfall in growth in this sector is likely to be
small.
1.12      According to estimates by Government officials and the fIP mission,
the overall production impact of the floods requires a downward adjustment of
projected GDP growth (at factor cost) by about 1-1/2 percentage points.
Furthermore, as a result of higher subsidies and lower iudirect tax revenue, GDP
growth In market prices would show an ev-n larger decline in comparison with pre-
flood projections.
1.13      The Government's ability to contain adverse effects of the disruption
of public Infrastructure and services on private sector growth depends on its
fiscal maneuverability. Speedy reconstruction of higbways, roads, irrigation and
drainage system and other facilities is estimated by Government to cost about
Rs 9 billion In this fiscal year. The Government expressed its intention to
mobilize part of the necessary resources through revenue measures and some
reallocation within the Public Sector Development Program.
1.14      Iuact on the Gvermaent's Structural Adjustment Effort. Prior to the
floods, considerable progress had been made in the implementation of economic
reforms. The Governmeat's policy of liberalization and privatization met with
a favorable response of the private sector. Output and exports grew strongly in
1T91/92, higher direct foreign investment and larger private domestic investment
led to a further upgraditg to the economy's capital stock. In 1Y92193 the reform
process was continued with a deepening of the privatization program, some further
liberalization of the trade regime, and financial sector reforms. The Government
also took steps to redress the pst neglect of the social sectors through the
implementation of the Social Action Program, and to address environmental issues
through the National Conserv&tion Strategy.



- 21 -
1.15      While the formulation of a policy package for continued structural
adjustment was still being finalized vith the IMP and World Bank, the flood
struck the country. The Government reacted by giving priority to addressing the
Immediate relief needs and tempora-ily postponing the adjustment efforts.  The
Government expects to incur higher than planned expenditures due to the floods.
Current expenditure is expected to be higher by Re 4 billion, mainly due to
relief operations, and development expenditure would increase by Re 9 billion,
due to the need of repairing the damage to the infrastructure. At the same time,
a revenue shortfall of Rs 10.2 billion is expected. Thus the budget deficit is
expected to increase by Rs 23 billion, or 1.71 of GDP, compared to the previous
for FY92193.
1.16      The banking sector will also be affected by the incre.ental financing
requirements for commodity operations, extension of credit for recovery of
agricultural activities, and losses of collateral against outstanding bank
credits. Together with higher public sector borrowing, these developments are
expected to lead to a higher than targeted inflation rate (11.5 instead of 82).
The major direct balance of payments impact results from the loss of export
receipts (estimated at some US$465 million) and higher imports of foodstuffs and
seeds, fertilizers and reconstruction equipment (US$245 million). Flood related
income losses may lead to some reduction in private sector imports, mitigating
the direct balance of payments impact to some extent. However, the current
account deterioration will cause additional pressures on an already weak external
financial situation.
1I. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE FOR RECOVERY
2.1       Prime Minister's Relief Package.  In order to alleviate some of the
hardships caused by the floods, the Prime Minister (PM) announced a relief
package.  It includes a compensation of Rs 50,000 to the fsmilies who lost an
income earning member (Rs 30,000 in case the deceased is not an earning member).
The total cost of this compensation is estimated at Re 50 million.   A
compensation of Re 5,000 is also announced for every house destroyed in floods
(total cost of Rs 230 million). Also, the entire flood affected area is declared
a calamity area, implying that residents of the area are exempted from payment
of income tax, wealth taxes, land revenues and user charges on irrigation water.
Similarly, the recovery of principal and interest on agricultural loans was
suspended for one year. For an early rehabilitation of small farmers (having
land of 12.5 acres or less), the PM' a package includes interest free loans from
the ADBP for purchase of seeds (one 40kg bag per acre) and fertilizer (two 40kg
bags per acre). The cost of the package is to be met from the Zakat Fund and the
1X surcharge levied on imports by the Ministry of Finance.
2.2       Apart from these immediate relief measures, no compensation for
production losses are to be given to the private sector. The Government intends
to keep expenditures on the above mentioned relief package at a limit of Rs. 4
billion.   The damage to the public sector, however,  requires substantial
expenditures for reconstruction and rehabilitation. Currently the Government
estimates the cost of reconstruction to be about Rs. 12.8 billion. Although not
all of the Government expenditure on reconstruction will happen in FY93, the
additional fiscal burden will still be considerable.  In order to reduce t-,
danger of macroeconomic destabilization, the Government is considering additional
measures to increase revenues, reduce current expenditures and rephase



- 22 -
development expenditures. Both the Bank and the If are discussing with the
Government ways to contain the adverse effects of the floods on macroeconomic
balances.
III. IDA RESPONSE AND ASSISTANCE STRATEgY
3.1       As soon as the magnitude of the flood damage became apparent, GOP
indicated to the Bank's field office in Islamabad its intention to seek IDA's
assistance for emergency reconstruction.  In order to enable IDA to respond
quickly, once a formal request was received, the field office staff, on September
10, 1992, immediately began gathering information from the federal and provincial
governments and started liasing with potential donors.  On September 24, 1992,
the Government of   Pakistan formally requested IDA to provide emergency
assistance. A Bank-wide Ad Hoc Advisory Group was immediately established to
mobilize expertise in emergency operations, as well as to assist and advise on
policy issues, project design and implementation and liaising with other donor
agencies. As a first step to mobilizing resources, an analysis of ongoing
projects under implementation was undertaken. Four projects were identified as
candidates for utilization of funds, with a total of about US$50.0 million
considered available for immediate disbursement by implementing agencies for use
in restoring flood damaged components. The scope of each ongoing project covers
activities that are broad enough to include flood rehabilitation work.
Therefore, while these funds could be tapped for this purpose, no change in the
legal agreements would be required.  These projects and the likely amounts that
could be made available for the flood rehabilitation work are as follows:
-- Transport Sector Investment   Ln. 3241-PAR,  US$10.0 million
-- Primary Education III, Punjab Cr. 1821-PAR,  US$ 8.0 million
-- Sindh Primary Education Dev.  Cr. 2102-PAK,  US$12.0 million
-- Irrigation Systems Rehab II   Cr. 1888-PAR,  US$20.0 million
3.2       The second step was to organize a multi-sector mission to visit
Pakistan with the purpose of preparing and, if appropriate, appraising a project
for IDA financing. ADB was also requested by the Government of Pakistan to
provide emergency funding, and the two institutions coordinated their efforts
during a mission in October 1992, and jointly appraised the proposed project.
IV. THE PROJECT
4.1       The proposed project  comprises a three-year time slice of the
Government's program to restore flood damaged public infrastructure affected by
the 1992 flood.   The mission's findings and the components identified for
financing by IDA and ADB are discussed below.
Riahway Subsector
4.2       Of the approximately 120,000 km of roads in Pakistan, 6,587 km are
designated as national roads by the National Highway Authority Act 1991 under the
jurisdiction of the Federal Government and 40,280 km are classified as provincial
roads under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. The remainder are
district, municipal and farm-to-market roads. All the national roads are paved
with either asphaltic concrete or bituminous surface treatment. About 502 of the
provincial roads are estimated to be paved. In function, the provincial roads
range from heavily trafficked intra-provincial links between major centers to



- 23 -
farm-to-market type roads, with varying surfaces of low standard bitucinous type
through gravel or shingle to earth.
4.3       Damane Assessment. The runoff from the unusually heavy rains during
July and August 1992 caused serious damage to the national and provincial road
networks in Sindh and Balochistant roads in southern Punjab and MWRP were also
damaged to a lesser extent. The surface water runoff from the rains exceeded the
capacity of the drainage structures at many locations, flooded over the road. and
washed away embankments and pavements adjacent to structures and In low-lying
areas. Bridge structures and culverts were damaged and river entrainment works
washed away.
4.4       Further damage to the road network was caused by the runoff from
continuous heavy rains during September in the northern catcbment areas of the
Jhelum and Chenab Rivers, resulting in further disruption to the road tran Sort
system in the upper Punjab and NWiP areas. The two rivers and their tributaries
swelled to record heights, not recorded since 1929, and carried trees, boulders
and other debris downstream.   Five major bridges crossing the Jhelum River and
one crossing the Kunhar River were swept from their bearings and carried eways
the approach roads to several of these bridges were also destroyed as were many
buildings adjacent to the roads. Small bridges and culverts were washed away or
choked with debris. Massive slips occurred in the road cuttings and embankments,
and low-lying roads were overtopped and pavements washed out.
4.5       The resulting damage to the road network from the two rains was
extensive and affected all provinces. The damage to the national roads has been
recorded by the provincial MRA offices and those records have been placed in the
project file. The damage was confirmed by selective site visits by IDA staff and
a more detailed inspection by consultants. In addition to the hardships imposed
on the inhabitants of the areas cut off, the resulting disruption to the nation's
road transportation system caused substantial economic losses.
4.6       The Government's response was commendably prompt in mobilizing all
resources to carry out tii following emergency work In order to ensure the supply
of food and medical supplies to isolated areas:
(a) clearing of debrisl
(b) construction of road diversions around damaged bridges and culvert.;
(c) provision of cable cars across rivers where road diversions were not
possiblet
(d) construction of cable ferries with ramps and approach roads at major
river crossings; and
(e) construction of pontoon or other temporary bridges and approach roas
at major river crossings.
4.7       The project would assist the NRA and the Prowvices In the design,
repair, rehabilitation, reconstruction, and supervision of the rain and flood
damaged road infrastructure in order to restore the road network to its original,
or more flood proof, condition. The subprojects to be selected for Inclusion in
the project will be subject to criteria as outlined In Appendix 2.



- 24 -
4.8       The proposed project will comprise the following component,, and
estimated costs are as shown In Table 1 belows
(a)  reconstruction of damaged roads includin  road embankments, pavement.,
culverts, small bridges and related ancillary works;
(b) repairing breaches and damaged roads, providing additional flood
protection works and slope stabilization (including drainage vents,
and culverts needed for passing larger flows in reconetructod road
sections);
(c) construction of the seven major bridges. and
(d) procurement of removable steel bridges.

4.9       In July and August, heavy rains inundated v"t areas both in urban and
rural Sindh. About 25,000 villages were flooded in the Provaie. According to
initial estimates, standing crops over 1609000 ha were wbolly or partially
damaged and 39,000 heads of cattle were lost. Rainfall rn-off also resulted in
extensive damage to irrigation, drainage and flood protection facilities.



- 25 -
4.10      The most devastating floods were caused by unprecedented and wide-
spread rains on September 8 and 9 in the catebments of Jhelum, Chenab sad Indus
Rivers, the federally administered northern areas, AJK, UWYP and moat of Punjab.
Exceptionally high flows were recorded in the Chenal and Jhelum Rivers. In the
Chenab River, peak discharges of 845,000 to 950,000 cusecs were recorded at the
Marala, Ehanki, end Qadirabad barrages. Large areas were inundated along the
river in the districts of Sialkot, Gujrat, Gujranwala and Jhang, causing damage
to crops, villages, roads and irrigation and drainage facilities and other public
Infrastructure.
4.11      The tributaries of Jhelum River upstream of the Mangla Dam also
recorded exceptionally high flows and several bridges were vashed away in AJK.
In the Jhelum River, two successive peaks of over 950,000 cuseces were recorded
at the Mangla Dam on September 9 and 10, within a span of a few hours, surpassing
all past records. The Mangla reservoir was already full to its conservation
level (elevation 1,202 above mean sea level). Because thx major part (551) of
the river catchment is located in India and it takes only a few hours for flood
waters from the rim stations (the most upstream gauging stations) to reach the
reservoir, the flood peaks could be reduced only partially through reservoir
management.
4.12      Several small villages downstream fr'm Mangla located in the flood
path were virtually destroyed with significant lose of life. The Raoul barrage
located down stream of Mangla received a peak flow of over 950,000 cusecs against
its designed capacity of 850,000. The left marginal bund upstream of the barrage
was breached by overtopping. The flood waters caused breaches in the Rasul-
Qadirabad link canal and also damaged the lower Jhelum canals which was breached
In 39 locations. The flood also caused 281 breaches and cuts in the Shahpur
Branch canal system. The Muhajir branch of the Thal canal and its distributors
also suffered damages. Downstream of Raoul barrage, the Jhelum flood waters
inundated large areas in the districts of Sargodha and Rhushab.
4.13      Fortunately, the flood peaks of Chenab and Jhelum Rivers synchronized
only partially at the Trimmu barrage, located at their confluence. Even so, the
flood flows exceeded the designed capacity of the barrage. To save the barrage
structures from serious damage, sections of flood embankments were breached in
order to release pressure on barrage structures and towns downstream, by
providing an alternative flow path the flood waters. However, extensive damage
was caused to the Rangpur canal system, including its 16 distributors, in which
openings occurred along a length of 140 miles. Downstream of Trimmu barrage, the
Chenab Is joined by the Ravi River, which was also flooded at that time. The
combined fury of both rivers threatened the city of Multan and the important
Shershah railway bridge. When the flood water rose to a critical level, the left
embankment of the bridge had to be breached. Mnother railway embankment (the
Doaba Bund) was overtopped and areas adjoining the town of Muzafargarh were
Inundated. The Muzafargarh canal and its distributors were damaged over a length
of 65 miles.
4.14      Further downstream, the flood waters recorded a peak flow of over
810,000 cusecs at the Panjmad barrage exceeding its designed capacity of 700,000
cusecs. The breaching section on the right bank of the barrage was operated when
the water rose to a critical level. The area between the barrage and the town



- 26 -
of Alipur was inundated, but the town itself was saved from major damage by the
embankment of Chanderwan distributor.
4.15      While the Jhelum and Chenab Rlivers were in spate, very high floods
were also experienced in the Indus River at Kalabagh, Chashma, and Taunsa. River
training and flood protection facilities were damaged in D. I. Rhan In NW?P and
some areas downstream of Taunsa barrage were inundated along the river.
4.16      In Sindh, the combined flood waters of the Indus and its tributaries
caused exceptionally high floods at the Guddu (over 1 million cusecs), Sukkur,
and Kotri barrages. Wkiile these floods generally passed safely through these
structures, damages were caused to river training and protection works. The
riverain areas between the flood embankments were inundated, and the local
population had to be evacuated.
4.17      In addition to the damages caused by the river flooding, torrential
rains in various districts of NW?P, AJR and the northern areas caused numerous
landslides and flash floods, resulting in extensive damage to farms, livestock,
villages, private irrigation channels, flooding of tubewells and other private
and public infrastructure.
4.18      Works required to restore the damage would involve the followings
(a)  Irrilation 8vstem.  Repair of breaches and canal banks; removal of
silt deposited by flood water; repair/reconstruction of control
structures, bridges, outlets and irrigation buildings, such as gauge
huts, accomuodations and offices.
(b)  Drainnee  System.      Desilting  of  drainage  channels,  repair/
reconstruction of inlet structures, repair of breaches and other
ancillary works.
(c)  Flood Protection Works.  Repair of breaches and restoration of eroded
embankments; repair of hydraulic structures; and restoration of river
control spurs.
(d)  Dams and Weirs.   These structures which are located in damaged
irrigation schemes will require restoration of embankments, aprons,
spillways and outlet control structures, and stone pitching.
(e)   arrastes.    Repair  of  control  gate  and  operating  mechanisms;
reinstatement of stonework protection on guide bunds and in downstream
aprons; and restoration of earthworks on guide and marginal bunds.

4.20     The flood damage in the education and health sectora  can be
categorized aa followes (a) schools (primary, middle and high) and basic health
facilities beyond repair which require total rebuilding; and (b) dmaged schools
and health facilities which can be repaired. In the flood affected provinces
(Punjabs Sindh, WP1) ani AJR, the number of dmaged schools in four provl:nce.
Is estimated at about 3,320 of which about 2,321 are primry education
facilities  The basic health centers did not suffer major dmages as the schools
and the majority of damges are repairable.
4.21     Most of the dmage to the schools and health facilities were
attributed to the severity of the flood, to the length of tim it lasted, and to
plaes affected by major landslides.  Buildings on those places should be
relocated to avoid future disaster. The nature of damages in school buildings
are mainly in boundary walls, flooring, roofing, swerage, toilets, gates and
demolition of class roams totally or partially.
4.22      The primry schools reconstruction/reair costs are estimated at
US$54.8 million equivalent and that of the basic health facilities US$3.7

Coordinating Aaenev
5.1       The Federal Flood Commission (FFC) of the Government's Ministry of
Water and Power will be the Coordinating Agency for the project.  FPC was
established in 1977 when the Federal Government assumed responsibility for the
funding of flood protection works after the 1973 and 1976 floods. FFC was given
the mandate to provide overall planning and coordination of the country's flood
protection works and to provide overall planning and coordination of the
country's flood protection development. Day-to-day activities of the FCC are the
responsibility of the Federal Flood Cell attached to FFC.
5.2       FEC was the Coordinating Agency of the IDA's and ADB's 1988 Flood
Damage Restoration Projects. At present, FFC is the executing agency of the
ongoing ADB financed Flood Protection Sector Project.   PFC's role in the
implemantation of these projects relates to overall coordination, the appointment
of consultants and the administration of the federal budget. The planning,
design and execution of the physical works is carried out by the provincial
implemeting agencies with the assistance of consultants.   Based on the
experience gained on previous projects, the FPC is considered capable of carrying
out the required project coordination and administration tasks for the proposed
project.

5.3       PFC would be responsible for (a) overall coordination of the project
and liaison with the financing agencies, (b) procurement of consultant services9
(c) preparation of budget requests and follow-up of fund releases, (d) monitoring
of project implementation, (e) maintenance of the project accounts relating to
expenditure by FEC and consolidation of financial records of the implementing
agencies, (f) submission to the Bank of withdrawal applications, and (g)
preparation of progress reports and a project completion report. Consultants
vill assist FFC in these tasks.
ImDlementing Agencies
5.4       Each implementing agency will be responsible,  in respect of the
activities to be carried out by it, for: (a) selection of subprojects; (b) design
of civil works; (c) preparation of tender documents and engagement of civil works
contractors; (d) land acquisition; (e) supervision of civil works contracts; (f)
maintenance of accounts; and (g) submission of requests for payment to the
Provincial Flood Damage Restoration Cells (PPDRC). The PFDRC will be headed by
a Provincial Project Coordinator assisted by suitable professional and support
staff to coordinate overall project implementation at the provincial level. The
PFDRC will, inter aliat (a) operate the relevant Special Account and submit
withdrawal applications to IDA with a copy to FFC; (b) monitor the auditing of
the project accounts; and (c) consolidate and furnish to FFC, within 30 days of
each reporting period; quarterly and annual progress reports received from the
implementing agencies.    The  following  agencies will be  responsible  for
implementation of their respective parts of the project.
5.5       National Hiahwav Authority -NRA).  The NH  will be responsible for
restoration of national highways under its jurisdiction and certain selected
works under the jurisdiction of the provincial authorities. NMA has been set up
as an autonomous organization, under the National Highway Authority Act of 19919
and is responsible for the planning, design, construction and maintenance of the
national highway system, which extends to about 6,000 km of the 120,000-km road
network of the country. Under the project, NIA will be responsible for the
restoration of national highways and, in particular, for the reconstruction of
a number of major bridges on these highways which were destroyed by the floods.
While NRA's involvement with ADB has been limited to the role of coordinator for
the preparation of the Provincial Highways Project, it has worked extensively
with IDA and is familiar with the procedures, guidelines and operation of special
accounts which apply to externally-financed projects of this nature. MBA has the
administrative and technical capacity to provide the support necessary for its
components under the proposed project.
5.6       Provincial Departments of Communications and Works.  The Provincial
Departments of Communications and Works (CWDs) would be responsible for
restoration of provincial and district (farm-to-market) roads under their
jurisdiction and of basic health facilities in their respective provinces and,
in NWEP, for restoration of primary education facilities.   The CWD in each
province would be responsible for roads declared to be provincial roads and, in
EWFP, for construction and maintenance of education facilities and other
buildings.   Provincial roads total around 40,000 km and range from heavily
trafficked intra-provincial highways to single lane farm-to-market accesses. The
CWDs construct and carry out heavy maintenance on their networks through local



- 30 -
contractors which are engaged and supervised through district-based organizations
headed by an executive engineer. Routine maintenance and immediate restoration
after natural disasters is generally implemented through force account, again
under the control of the executive engineer. The CWDs have extensive experience
with the procurement and special account procedures through the ADB Farm-To-
Market Roads project, and will be able to deal with the additional workload
arising from the proposed project without major difficulty, in particular since,
as is the case with the ongoing projecto, they will be assisted by consultants.
5.7       Provincial Departments of Irrigation.  The Provincial Departments of
Irrigation (PIDs) would be responsible for restoration of irrigation, drainage
and flood control facilities in their respective provinces.   The PIDs are
established institutions that are responsible for the operation and maintenance
of the irrigation and drainage systems and the maintenance of flood control
works.
5.8       Under IDA's and ADB's Flood Damage Restoration Projects of 1988, the
PIDs implemented works for irrigation, drainage and flood control infrastructure.
The PIDs are also the implementing agencies for the ongoing ADB-financed Flood
Protection Sector Project. Considering the successful implementation of the
previous restoration projects, the PIDs are considered to have the required
implementation capacity to also carry out the restoration works under the
proposed project.
5.9       Provincial Departments of Education.  The Provincial Departments of
Education ould be responsible for selection of flood-damaged primary education
facilities to be rebuilt under the proposed project.   In NWFP and AJK,
construction of schools would be carried out under the supervision of the
Communication and Works Departments. In Punjab and Sindh provinces, construction
and  rehabilitation  of  primary  education  facilities  is  currently  the
responsibility of the civil engineering units of the education departments.
However, under the previous and on-going IDA-financed education projects, these
units have not been able to implment the full programs which they were assigned.
The units have now been strengthened, and will take responsibility for
implementing the reconstruction of flood-damaged schools financed under the
proposed project and from the on-going credits. However, in areas where units
have inadequate implementation capacity, reconstruction of schools to be financed
under the proposed project would be undertaken by other agencies, based on
instructions of the provincial education departments. Provincial governments
will propose suitable arrangements for implementation of the school restoration
component of the project.
Implementation Period
5.10      Project implementation has been under way since September  1992
starting with the restoration of vital services and preliminary steps to
implement permanent restoration works. It is anticipated that it would take
three construction seasons to complete all project related works.   Each
construction season excludes the months of July, August and September, which
correspond to the rainy season in Pakistan. The project will be physically
completed by June 30, 1996.

ConsultinR Services
5.11      A firm of consultants will be eusaged under the project to assist the
PFC and the Implementing Agencies in the general areas shown below. An outline
of terms of reference for the consulting services are given in Appendix 4.
(a)   overall project coordination and supervision;
(b)   certification of eligible projects/subprojects and their costs;
(c)   engineering assistance and Intermittent supervision of the worksg
(d) certification of progress payments oan a random basis and all final
payments;
(e)   preparation and conduct of a project review not later than one year
after the date of credit effectiveness; and
(f)   preparation of monthly and quarterly progress revorts and a project
completion report.
Financina Plan
5.12      The project cost of Part I is estimated at US$397.2 million
equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of about US$119.8 million
equivalent (301) and taxes and duties estimated at about US$40.0 million
equivalent. The IDA credit of US$100.0 million equlvalent and ADB's contribution
of a sgimilar amount would finance about 50S of the cost of Part I. In addition,
a utilization of funds from existing World Bank/IDA-financed ongoing projects
would finance up to 131 of the cost. The balance would be provided by the
Government and other potential donors.  Because of the emrgency nature of the
work and the critical need for IDA assistance, retroactive financitg would be
provided on an exceptional basis for expenditures Incurred on authorized project
activities since Sentember 10. 1992.
5.13      The proposed credit would be on standard TDA terms with 35 years
maturity. The proceeds of the IDA credit will be retained partly by the Federal
Government for use by the Federal Flood Comission, with the rest being made
available to NHR and IWFP, Punjab, Sindh, Dalochistan (the provinces) and AJK
through budgetary allocations on a first-come, first-serve basis.
5.14      The Government agreed that it would make available on a timely basis
all necessary budgetary allocations to ensure that matching funds are available.
The proposed IDA credit would finances (a) civil works under Part I of the
project; (b) procurement of removable steel bridges (Bailey-type or equivalent);
and (c) consultancy services during project implementation. IDA and ADB vould
joint'? finance the costs of consultant services and individually fiance each
of the subprojects.



- 32 -
Procurement
5.15      Procurement will be carried out according to World Bank Guidelines for
Procurement dated May 1992.  It is envisaged that, except as stated below,
procurement will be confined to civil works which will mainly be undertakeu by
contractors whose services will be procured under local competitive bidding
procedures acceptable to IDA and detailed in Appendix 5.  Inter alia, these
procedures require that for all contracts, the period for bid preparation will
be a minimum of 30 days. Construction of major bridges identified by MNA under
the project will be carried out under contracts awarded using international
competitive bidding procedures according to World Bank Guidelines.  Limited
international bidding procedures will be adopted for the proposed procurement of
removable bridges (Bailey-type or euivalent) by DNA. Force account would be
used only for restoration of some schools end basic health facilities and for
selected flood control and irrigation works. For other works, force account
would be eligible only during the period applicable to retroactive financing.
5.16      Certain emergency works which have already been carried out under
force account, direct contractitg, local shopping, or through variation orders
on existing contracts will be reviewed by IDA on a case-by-case basis for
eligibility under retroactive financing. All civil works contracts with a value
of Rs 25 million or more, all contracts for construction of major bridges, and
all contracts for procurement of Bailey-type bridges, will be subject to prior
IDA review and approval. Advance procurement action has been agreed between the
Government and the management of IDAJADB In respect of priority subprojects on
condition that all advance action is carried out In accordance with procurement
procedures detailed in Appendix S.
IDA Financina of Civil Works
5.17      Prior to the coommeemeut of civil workes  pre-construction surveys
should be prepared in adequate detail to allow verification of work quantities
by the consultants, and would be made available for random checking by IDA
supervision missions. Only civil works for which adequate pre-construetion
surveys are available will be eligible for IDA financing.
Disbursements
5.18      The proceeds of the IDA credit would be disbursed against eligible
expenditures as follows:
(a) Civil works - 9O0 of expenditures net of taxes;
(b) Goods - 1002 of CII value of ramovable bridgesg and
(c)   Technical Assistance - 1008 not of taxes
(502 by IDA and 502 by ADB).



- 33 -
Special Accounts
5.19      A Special Account would be established in the National Bank of
Pakistan by FPC and NUA and by each participating province, aud AJK. All the
Special Accounts taken together would have an initial aggregate deposit in US
dollars of approximately US$10.5 million equivalent, and on terms and conditions
satisfactory to IDA.   All disbursements against contracts for less than
US$400,000 million for works would be made on the basis of Statements of
Expenditures (SOEs) certified by the supervisory consultants. The documentation
for SOEs would not be sent to IDA, but would be retained by the implementing
agencies and made available for audit by the project auditors, and inspection by
IDA supervision missions. Disbursements for expenditures exceeding that amount
would be against full documentation. Disbursements for force account would be
made on the basis of measured output, at rates reviewed by the supervisory
consultants and subject to approval by IDA.
5.20      Assuming that the credit would become effective by June 1993, the
estimated completion of the project would be June 30, 1996, with a proposed
closing date of December 31, 1996.
Accounts and Audit
5.21      Annual andits of expenditures by each participating province, AJK, NB
and PFC would be performed by the Auditor General of Pakistan. The audit reports
covering Special Accounts and SOEs would be submitted to IDA not later than six
months after the close of each fiscal year.
Selection of SubDroiects
5.22      Each project implementing agency will submit subprojects to FPC for
a decision, in consultation with IDA and ADB, on the source of financing. In
determining the source of financing, FCC wiil take into account the need for a
balanced commitment of the IDA credit and ADB loan.   The selection of the
subprojects will be done according to the agreed criteria (Appendix 2) and an
indication will be given as to how each subproject conforms to the criteria. The
scope of subprojects for restoration of primary schools and basic health
facilities will be limited to replacement of facilities that have been damaged
beyond repair. Subprojects proposed for Bank financing whose total cost exceeds
US$1.0 million equivalent will be submitted to IDA for prior review. This
requirement will enable IDA to cover, among others, all subprojects which will
involve major restoration works to the facilities or which are otherwise of
technically complex nature. The lists of subprojects may be revised and updated
from time to time, but no new subprojects, the implementation of which would
extend beyond the date of physical completion of the project, will be submitted
to IDA.

1992 FLOOD DANAGE RESTORATION CROJECT
History of Floods in Pakistan and IDA's Assistance
A. The Problem
1.   Pakistan comprises two main topographic regions. By far the most important
is the Indus river basin which covers most of the Punjab and Sind and amall areas
of the other two Provinces, Balochistan and North West Frontier Province. The
other region is the dry, sparsely populated inland basin of Balochistan. About
two-thirds of the In'.s basin is vithin Pakistan but the headwaters of its main
left bank tributaries, the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi and Sutlej rivers lie to the
north in India. About half the annual discharges of the Indus rivers are
diverted in Pakistan into one the world's largest canal irrigation systems. In
the system some 33 million acres of the Indus Plains are served by about 38,000
miles of canals and by two major storage dams, Mangla on the Jhelum river and
Tarbela on the Indus. Other key components of the system are 17 major diversion
barrages.
2.    Floods in Pakistan occur most frequently and are most extensive and
damagingi in the Indus Plains. Because of different hydrologic and topographic
conditions, and their less dense populations, floods in Balochistan and North
West Frontier Provinces are not so extensive or damaging.
3.   Rivers in the Indus Plains are prone to channel aggradation, a gradual rise
in the elevation of the river bed, and consequently to a deterioration in their
capacity to carry high flows. This is a natural characteristic that to some
extent has been intensified by heavy withdrawals for irrigation and the
construction of storage reservoirs. Floods in the Plains are generated in the
mountainous upper catecment areas of the Indus and its tributaries where intense
rainfall, snow-melt, steep gradients and limited valley storage can cause a rapid
build up of high river flows. On reaching the broad, relatively flat Indus
Plains, flows with elevations only slightly above the river banks can spread and
cause flooding over large areas, especially in Sind. Flood risk is most high
during the July through September monsoon period.
4.   Flood protection in the Indus Plains is achieved largely through the
construction of flood protection embankments or bunds. In Sind Province, the
Indus is bunded on both banks for virtually its entire length.  In Punjab,
marginal bunds have been constructed at all barrages and major river structures.
These flow-directing embankments protect the works from being by-passed when the
rivers are in flood. Overtopping of bunds occurs only rarely. However, failure
or breaches can occur at any location and result in the unpredictable inundation
of large areas. Furthermore, irrigation canals can convey flood water long
distances from the point of river spill. In the Punjab, the general land slope
is to the southwest; consequently, failures of bunds on the left banks of rivers
are particularly serious as water spilled will not drain back into the river.

Arnnedix 1
Page 2 of 5
5.    Improvement of the existing flood protection system of levees or bunds
along the rivers is the only practical weans, in the foreseeable future, for
protection against floods. A technically better solution would be construction
of a reservoir complex of sufficient size to provide storage and thus the control
of floods.   Unfortunately,  there are very limited possibilities for the
construction of such a complex at reasonable cost and no such development would
appear economically feasible In the near future.
6.   A flood forecasting ard warning system has evolved over the years.  A
central feature of this system is a flood Warning Center (FWC) established each
monsoon season at Lahore (Punjab) by the Pakistan Meteorological Department
(PMD). Flood forecasting procedures used by PMD include estimating rainfall in
the upper catchment areas and using hydrological techniques that take account of
forecast or measured rainfall, antecedent moisture conditions, time of year and
river basin flow.
B. The 1973 Floods and Rehabilitation Progr=m
7.    In August 1973 there were serious floods in Paklstan for the first time in
13 years. Heavy monsoon rains caused breacher in the bi.nds at ten places in the
Punjab and three places In the Sind, causing videspread inundation and severe
damage. Altogether some 10 million acres were inu=dated, of which 4 million were
under crops.
8.    At the request of the Pakistan Governament, IDA, in collaboration with other
specialized agencies of the U.N. system made an assessment of the flood situation
in October 1973 and appraised a flood rehabilitation program for which an IDA
Credit of $35 million was approv&d by the Executive Directors and signed in
March, 1974 (Credit No. 466 PAR). Under this Credit, US$18 million was allocated
for industrial Imports to relieve the impact on the balance of payments. The
other US$17 million financed various activities directly related to flood damage,
principally the repair and reconstruction of flood protection, drainage and road
systems and spare parts and other items for agricultural equipment and Government
construction machinery.
9.   All restoration works under the 1974 credit were completed before the onset
of the 1974 monsoon. This excellent progress reflected good cooperation and
effort by the various Government agencies concerned and close supervision by
consultants. The project Improved parts of the system to standards above the
pre-flood conditions and the works stood up vell to the further severe floods
which occurred in 1975 and 1976. Implementation of the industrial imports
program financed under the 1974 credit aloo progressed satisfactorily. Although
delays in procurement of some specialized Items for agricultural equipment and
construction machinery necessitated an extension of the credit by 18 months, all
funds had been committed by the ne Closing Date of December 319 1976.
10.  In addition to its physical aspects, the 1974 credit initiated studies
aimed at reducing the possibility of flood disasters in the loger term. For
this purpose, the credit provided finanee for consultants to review the flood
forecasting, warning and protection arrangemts * The consultants recommended
improvements to the flood forecasting and warning system which have been
incorporated in a UDDP/World Meteorological Organization Project In Pakistan.

Under this project, a Qu8ntitative Precipitation Measurement (QPM) Radar Station
Is to be installed.   Due to delays In approval of the WMO/UNDP project,
escalation in equipment costs made it impossible to procure another essential
element of the meteorological facilities, a Meteorological Satellite Readout
Station (MSRS) for identification and tracking of intense monsoon depressions.
The proposed IDA project includes the procurement and installation of the MSRS.
11.   Under the 1974 credit, the consultants also completed a preliminary survey
of flood protection systems in Pakistan and recommended a full-scale study
leaftng to che formulation of a national flood proteotion program. In line with
the consultants recommendations, the Government estallished a Federal Flood
Commission in January 1977 with responsibility for preparing a flood prot,.ction
plan for the country.
C. The 1976 Floods
12. In the monsoon season of 1976 Pakistan experienced unusually heavy
rainfall. During June through September, rainfall exceeded the 30-year average
except for northern Balochistan by at least 502, but in many areas by more than
1002; for example, Lahore (Punjab) 1752, PePhawar (North West Frontier Province)
2302 and Jacobabad (Sind Province) 128Z.  For 23 representative recording
stations, rainfall in the four months exceeded that of 1973 by about 102. The
rains fell with consiudrable intensity often in excess of lOOmm/day, exceeding
soil absorptive capacity and causing heavier than usual runoff. This resulted
in extensive and serious flooding as vel.. as damage from hill torrents and the
direct impact of continuous torrential rain.
13. Much as In 1973, the Punjab experienced the first impact of the high
rainfall when flows In the Rlvi, the most flood-prone river of the basin, and the
Chenab river bagan to rise rapidly in the second half of July. Serious flash
flooding also occurred. Discharges at the Balloki and Sidhnai barrages on the
Ravi excueded design capacities, and on August 15 the highest ever discharge was
recorded at Sidhnai. Water levels in the Indus started rising in the third week
of July In the wake of heavy rains in its catebment area. When these flows were
joined by those of the left bank tributaries at Panjnad, levels quickly rose to
record peaks.   On August 16, 1976 a new record of 1,200,000 cusecs was
established at the Sukkur Barrage. High flows in the Indus resulted in several
breaches in the river's protective bunds and In canals, which resulted in
widesprea4 flooding in Sind.   Thie was exacerbated by unprecedented heavy
rainfall in the first two weke of September in Sind and lalochistan which caused
extensive local damage.
14.  The floods, which inundated more than 20 million acres, and heavy rains
caused loss of life, the destruction end damage of mwuch private propertyt in
particular private houses, air' losses of crops and livestock. Four hundred and
thirty people are reported to  ,o died through drowning and through being buried
under collapsed houses. A feature of the disaster was the collapse of houses and
buildings whose structures became saturated with rain and flood water. A very
large number of public buildings were destroyed or seriously damaged.  For
example, a total of 8,900 educational institutions were damaged, of which 6,100
were totally destroyed. Most of these vere mud-built primary schools, but 900
middle schools and 40 high schools were also destroyed. The mud-built houses of



- 37 -
A&Rendii 1
Page 4 of 5
-rural people suffered most.  Some 18,000 villages were affected and it was
estimated that over one million houses totally collapsed or were badly damaged.
There was considerable lose of grain and seed stored in these buildings. More
than 3 million acres of kharif (summer) crop were affected by the flooding and
the equivalent of about 2.4 million acres of crops were totally destroyed.
15.   Damage to infrastructure was also substantial.   Eighteen sections of
railway lines in Punjab and four .n each of Sind, Balochistan and West Frontier
Provinces were damaged. The national highway network suffered extensive damage.
In the Indus Plains, flood waters broke protecting bunds, breached embankments
and submerged low-lying roads. Where river originating floods did not occur,
rainfall stagnated for weeks alongside roads, saturating the subgrade. When
these roads were re-opened, traffic caused the pavement to disintegrates and on
long stretches the roads suffered serious deformation.
16.   The storms and floods caused widespread damage in the irrigation sector.
Severe damage was caused to 13 of the 17 barrages and to seven of the major link
canals. Several serious breaches were made in flood protection bunds, more than
half of the canal system irrigating over 10 million acres was damaged, and some
1,000 public tubewells and a number of small dams were destroyed. In Balochistan
the 62-ft. high Bolan dam was overtopped and washed out.
17.   Pakistan incurred an estimated foreign exchange losses of over US$300
million because of the floods. Lost cotton exports and edible oil imported to
meet deficits in cottonseed oil production accounted for about US$190 million.
Losses of stored grain and, because of damage to irrigation facilities, of rabi
(winter) season wbeat, an estimated US$45 million in terms of exports or
replacement imports, after deducting increas3-d production attributable to bettee
soil moisture conditions. The foreign exchange cost of the priority restoration
program, was estimated at about US$60 million plus the cost of farm tractors (an
estimated 400) needed to replace the 12,000 draft animals lost.
18.   Because of the floods, budget revenues from cotton exports declined by
about Rs 480 million and other revenues by Rs 200 million, a net loss of Re 680
million (US$68 million). This figure does not include the estimated Rs 2.23
billion needed to restore infrastructure and public buildings to the pre-flood
situation; GOP met these costs by external assistance and by deferring or
curtailing development schemes.
D. The 1988 Floods
19. Pakistan experienced two separate and devastating floods in 1988. In July
and August, heavy rains fell in the upper catcbment areas. This resulted in high
flows in the Indus, Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which coincided with heavy rains
in Sind. Flows of over 1.1 million cusece were recorded in August at the Guddu
and Sukkur barrages on the lower Indus river. Serious flood damage occurred in
Sind at this time. Also in August, extresmely intense rainfall occurred in the
North West Frontier Province and Balochistan, causing flash floods and resulting
in heavy damage. The second flood, which occurred in September and October, was
caused by heavy rains in the upper catcbments in India of the Chonab, Ravi and
Sutlej rivers where flows approached or exceeded historic levels at most gauging
stations. Damage from this flood was extremely heavy but fortunately was limited



- 38 -
ADgendix 1
Page 5 of 5
to Punjab. An estimated 400 lives were lost, and three million people were made
homeless. About one million ha or irrigated crop land was inundated, with large
losse, to the cotton, rice, and sugarcane crops, and major losses were
experienced in the large industrial area along the Ravi river in the Lahore
suburbs. A summary of damage to public infrastructure (irrigation, drainage,
flood protection, roads, railways, telephone and telegraph, schools, health
facilities, etc) is as followss
(a)   about 1,500 km of canals, drainage channels and flood
protection works in Punjab, three major canal commands
in Sind, the Pat Feeder canal in Balochistan, and Warsak
Lift and Mama Khil Jaded Canals in UWFP;
(b)   about 500 km of major flood protection work.;
(c)   over 3,000 km of roads and related structures;
(d)   15 sections of railways totaling over 100 breaches of
embankments;
(e)   2,150 public buildings; and
(f)   a major telephone and telegraph coaxial cable between
Multan and Bahawalpur, and telephone exchange facilities
in Lahore.
20.   It was estimated that as a result of these floods about one million
hectares of irrigated crop land and settled areas were inundated or otherwise
adversely affected, resulting in large losses to the cotton, rice and sugarcane
crops. More than three million people were made homeless and about 500 lives
were lost.
21. Immediately following the floods, GOP and Provincial Governments mobilized
relief programs and undertook restoration measures wit their own funds. However,
the magnitude of restoration work required and the shortage of budget funds
resulted in GOP's urgent appeals for international donor assistance in this
emergency. IDA responded by instructing a water sector mission visiting Pakistan
in October 1988 to assess the damage and need for assistance, and approving the
SDR 30.6 million (US$40.0 million) credit for restoration of selected public
infrastructure which is the subject of this PCR. The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) approved a parallel project for US$44 million (Loan 957-PAK). Government
designated specific administrative units to the IDA and ADB projects.  In
addition, the Islamic Development Bank offered a loan of US$10 million for the
restoration of health, education, railway and telecommunication facilities, but
this assistance did not materialize.   The IDA and ADB projects, including
Government contributions, covered the restoration to their preflood condition of
almost all damaged public irrigation, drainage, flood protection and road
facilities.

1992 FLOOD DAMAGE RESTORATION PROJECT
_ubnrolect Selection Criterig
A. General Criteria
1.         The following general and sector-specific criteri are to be used In
selecting subprojects for Bank financing. Where 'the Bank' Is mentioned it shall
be understood to refer to both the World Bank and to the Asian Developmet Bank,
unless the context requires otherwise. Except as the Bank may otherise agree,
each Implementing Agency shall select and prioritize subprojects for inclusion
in accordance with the criteria set out in paragraphs 2 to 5 below.
2.          To be accepted for inclusion within the Project, the vorks under the
proposed subprojects shall meet the following general criteria:
i.   The works are located within the area affected by the exceptional
1992 flood and rainfall events1, over the period July to September
1992;
ii.  The works are a consequence of the 1992 flood and rain events, or
are works which, if not undertaken, will degrade or severely
diintish the effectiveness of other flood dmage being repaired
under the Project;
iii. The dmage has been caused by flooding and rains, either directly
(through overtopping, scour, or similar action), or indirectly
(through, for example, weakening of foundations, protection works or
pavement structures leading to premature failure under traffic,
etc), and will include breaches cut in road and other embankments to
reduce the impact of the flood;
iv.   Where conditions have changed so significantly since the original

B. National HighbaWs and Provincial Roads
2.          Subprojects which meet the criteria for inclusion in the project are
to be designed or othewise processed in accordance with the following:
L.    Reconstruction will restore roads to their original specifications
or to such higher specifications, including necessary additions or
alterations, as may be warranted to ensure their operational
performance and integrity over a reasonable life;
ii.  Roads which, pro-flood, had been provided with an all-weather
surface will be provided with an all veather surface over a pavement
designed in accordance with procedures used for ongoing MU and
COYL2 projects. Roads which had not been provided with an all-
weather surface will not be provided with such a surfae. Road
widths will not be increased, In terms of number of lanes, but may
be increased by small amounts to enable a single lane road to meet
the width standards of the PHR projects, or to enable a two lane
road to meet the currently accepted width standards for two lane
roads. Notwithstanding these provisions, widths shall not be
increased where the damage is confined to only short lengths of a
road on the remainder of which the width is below standard;
Iii. Rehabilitation/reconstruction of cross drainage works (bridges,
culverts, atc) will be carried out giving appropriate consideration

site, including the provision of balancing culverts where none had
previously existed, for an appropriate return period. The original
structures are not necessarily to be duplicated;
iv.   The widths of replacement cross drainage structures are to suit the
road function and will not be increased from single to two lane
unless, in certain exceptional cases, the traffic volume using the
structure warrants the provision of two lanes. In such cases, as set
out in para A (i) above, an economic analysis of the proposed
improvement will be carried out;
v.    The designs of road pavements and in particular cross drainage
structures are to be reviewed to identify means by which they can be
made more resistant to damage arising from flooding. In particular,
attention will be paid to foundation design and to protection works;
vi.   Notwithstanding the threshold for pre-bid review given in para A
(iii) above, the design and contract documentation for the
rehabilitation of the protection works associated with the Indus
River bridge in D I Khan will be subject to detailed review by the
Bank prior to the invitation of bids;
vii. Bid documents and bidding procedures, including invitation, opening,
approval and award, will be identical, except where specifically
amended by the loan/credit agreements under which the project is
being fianmced, to those usel1 for ongoing Bank-financed BRA or
CWDV projects, as appropriate; and
viii. Bids will be invited only f om contractors prequalified by NH and
CWDs for similar sized or larger works, and who have performed
satisfactorily on those works.
C. IrriLation. Drainaae and Flood Control
a.    Irrigation and Drainate
i.    Project works will generally be limited to the restoration of
damaged infrastructure to pre-flood conditions. For the "civil"
canals in NWPM, the restoration works will be limited to the damaged
infrastructure earlier provided by the Government to the
beneficiaries and to new, large structures which are now required as
the result of the flood damage but which are beyond the capacity of
the beneficiaries to construct. The restoration of irrigation
infrastructure mainly comprises earthworks and concrete and masonry
works for the rebuilding and repair of damaged storage and diversion

embankments, damaged canal lining and structures and bridges. The
restoration of damaged drainage Infrastructure principally involves
desilting of surface and subsurface drains but also rebuilding and
repair of drainage inlets and outlets and repairs of pumps except
for SCARP tubewells in fresh groundwater zones,
ii.   For rebuilding of irrigation and drainage structures and contiguous
sections of canal lining, the design standards and specifications
developed under the World Bank/USAID/Dutch financed Second

Bank-financed 1988 Flood Damage Restoration Project.
b.    Flood Control
I.    Project works will generally be limited to restoration of the
damaged infrastructure to pre-flood conditions. The restoration
works will mainly comprise repair and rebuilding of breached and
eroded embankments and washed away and damaged river training works
involving earthworks and repair and replacement of stone revetments
and aprons;
II.  Restoration involving improvements will be allowed to provide a
uniform level of flood protection taking into account the level of
flood protection provided by the adjoining flood protection
infrastructure. For completely or substantially damaged spurs within
river reaches not included under the ongoing Flood Protection Sector
Project, the pre-flood design and condition will be reviewed and
design improvements madel/ to minimize the risk of future damageg
iII.  Notwithstanding the threshold for pre-bid review given in para A
(iii) above, the design and contract documentation for the
restoration of substantially or completely damaged major spurs and
bank revetments along the Indus River and its tributaries will be
subject to review by the Bank prior to invitation of bids. For this
purpose, the consultant will prepare a report detailing the measures
incorporated in the design to minimize the risk of a recurrence of
the damage, taking into account the dynamic hydraulic and
morphologic conditions within the concerned river reach; and
1/    This may require hydraulic model studies to determine the optimal design.

1992 nLOOD DAMAGE RESTORATION PROJECT
Procurement Procedures
A. Civil Works
1.          All procurement will be carried out in accordance with the Guidelines
for Procurement of either the World Bank (May 1992) or the Asian Development Bank
(March 1989) depending on which institution is financing a particular contract,
unless specifically stated otherwise in the legal documents. Generally Local
Competitive Bidding procedures will be adopted, although some larger HUA bridge
contracts will be procured through International Competitive Bidding procedures.
LCB contracts will be advertised in at least one English daily local newspaper
of wide circulation. At least 30 days notice period will be provided from the
date of publication of the press notice or availability of bidding documents
whichever is earlier to the last date of bid submission.
2.          Road and associated structural works within the same district or
equivalent administrative unit will be grouped to achieve a minimum estimated
contract value of Rs 1.5 million. For road work contracts regardless of size,
bids will be invited only from contractors previously prequalified or registered
by BHA or CWDs, as appropriate, for similar sized or larger works, and who have
performed satisfactorily on these works.
3.          Irrigation/drainage and flood protection works within the same
engineering jurisdiction will be grouped to achieve a minimum estimated contract
value of Rs 1.5 million. For contracts estimated to cost more than Rs 25.0
million bidders will be pre-qualified using procedures acceptable to the Bank.
Prequalification criteria will include financial capacity, experience with works
of a similar nature (to be supported by certificates of successful completion
from the agency for whom the works wcrs executed), and the resources - persomnnl,
plant, etc - available with the contractor. For contracts estimated to cost less
than Rs 25.0 million, bids will be invited from firms registered with the
Provincial Irrigation Departments.
4.          To the extent possible, school and basic health unit works within the
same district or equivalent administration unit will be grouped to achieve a
minimum contract size of Re 1.0 million.
5.          Unless otherwise agreed by the Bank, works executed by force acco^unt
will be accepted for financing only if they were commenced after September 10,
1992 and completed by 31 October 1992. For drainage and flood protection works,
however, principally earthworks for spurs and embankments and drain desilting
respectively, which have short implementation periods and require the use of
large equipment available only with the PIDs, the latter date will not apply.
Civil works undertaken by force account will be accepted on the basis of rates
per unit of work. These rates will be determined on the basis of the operation



- 54 -
Ana,dia S

and maintenance cost of the equipmnt engaged, excluding depreciation cost, and
the coat of labor and materials used. The rates will be reviewed by the
consultant and adjusted whore necessary.
6.          For  works  executed  under  contracts,  the  following  specific
procurement criteria will be applied:
L.    Bidlcontract  documnts  used  for  the  purpose  of  iviting
bids/awarding works, shall be documents cleared by the lank for use
on similar works, under on-going lank funded projects;
i.   Blid security (bid guarantee) requirements will be clearly stated in
the invitation notice and be strictly enforced during bid opening,
to ensure participation only by serious bidders;
iii. Appropriate price adjustment clauses shall be used for all works
where the specified completion period exceeds twelve montbs;
iv. Bids shall be opened in public, at the time and place stated in the
invitation for bids, in the presence of bidders representatives who
choose to be present. Bids shall be evaluated according to the
criteria stated in the bid documents. The contract shall be awarded
to the eligible and qualified bidder, who has offered a
substantially responsive bid with the Lowest Evaluated Blid Price.
Evaluation reports for contracts falling below the Bank's prior
review threshold, will be cleared with the consultants after
contract award;
v.    once reasonable competition has been ensured (through proper press
notification and adequate time period for submitting bids), and
multiple bids have been received, the implemsnting agency will not
negotiate with the lowest evaluated bidder in an effort to reduce
prices, when the prices bid are perceived to be high in relation to
an estimate prepared on out-dated or inappropriate standard
schedules of rates; and
vi. The implementing agency will consult with the Bank before rejecting
all bids or inviting new bids. Rebidding to the same specifications
shall not be done solely for the purpose of obtaining lower prices

The objective of the proposed upgrading and iWrovment of the
country's capability for flood forecasting and warning is to ininimea lose of
life and damage to private and public assets as the  result of severe flooes in
the Indus liver and its main tributaries. It is enwisaged that the upgrading
and Improvement will be achieved through the flood forecasting and warning
component of the ongoing Bank-fianced (ADB) Flood Protection Sector Project
and a complementary Technical Assistance (TA). The upgrading and improvemet
will focus on the following areas:
a.  jWebatherR .  A 10 cm weather radar will be procured and
itealled in Lahors to provide for stom tracking and prediction
of rainfall in the catebment areas of the Indus liver and its
tributaries including those areas located In India.
b.   Teleetrr and 1F Radio Cojnuication. A telmetry system will be
procured to collect and tranmit rainfall and water level data
from stations In the catchment areas of the Tudus liver and its
tributaries within the jurisdiction of Pakistan oan a real-time
basis. This system will replace the present system which has
already exceeded its useful life. In addition, around 25 UP radio
sets for voice comaunication during floods will be procured.
c.   J      gmetg.  A flow measurement program in combination with
bathymetric surveys is envisaged to establish reliable rating
curwes for selected river stations and berraess and to provide
cross-sectional data of the rivers. The flow meaurSmt and
survey program will provide data for the developmet of rainfall-
ruoff and flood routing models.
d.   Flood Plain Maninag. Maps of flood-prone aras including contour
lines and features of villages and infrastructure will be prepared
on the basis of existing topographical maps, recent satellite
imgery, aerial photographs flown In the 1970. and additional
terr"trial surveys as required. These maps will provide data for
the development of flood routing models and for the production of
a flood warning manual.

,    Hvdrolora and Meteoroloev.  Various hydrological baseline studies
will be carried out Including, inter alias
1.    development of methods and procedures for the forecasting of
rainfall amount and duration associated with monsoon
tropical depressions for all relevant catchments, based on
weather radar and also including the Indin catcbmente of
the relevant river.;
it.  collection, screening, validation and analysis of historical
rainfall, water level and river flow data including, to the
extent possible, data pertaining to the Indus tributaries In
India;
ill. water balance studies;
iv.   establishment of tie series of water level and flow data
for the calibration of various rainfall-runoff and flood
r-outing models;
v.    specific hydrological studies to develop a model for
forecasting 24 hour inflow volumes for the major reservoirs
and to asees the potential role of these reservoirs for
flood attenuation;
Vi., collection and analysis of information on the operation
rules for the reservoirs on the Indus tributaries in India.
A hydrological data base and processing system will be procured
for data storage and anlysis.
f.    Develogment of Flood  oreocastina Models.  Rainfall-runoff and
flood routing model, with data assimilation procedures (filters)
for updatifg model results and parameters based on real-tim
observed flow data will be developed and provided with a user-
frieadly Interface. For the models and user-interface, available
software will be used to the extent possible. The models will be
tested based on the simulation of real-tim forecasting conditions
for specific historical flood events and on actual flood
condition. during TA inplementation. The models will also be made
available In an off-line mode to serve for planning and design of
flood protection works.
g.    3gaogvor zMag g.  The potential for reducing flood peaks and
subsequent flooding through improved reservoir management will be
assessed under conditions of inproved flood forecasting and early
warning. Operation rules for flood periods will be reviewed, and
modifications and related institutional arrangements proposed. The
feasibility of a gated emergency spillway at mangla reservoir, to
be operated in conjunction with an accurate flood forecasting
systm, will be assessed at pro-feasibility level.

h.   Flood ganaent and Mitigation. Methods to rout sovers floods
with a minimum level of damage will be developed and locations for
breaching sections under various flood scenarios will be
determined. Necessary improvments of hydraulic structureos
including the construction of by-pa.s channels, will be assessed
at pre-feasibility level. Proposals for structural and non-
structural measures to contain damage as the result of unavoidable
breaches will also be developed. The possibilities for flood plain
zoning and legislation to prevent occupation of flood escape
routes will be reviewed.
i.    Gecarauhical Information System. A 3-dimeusional Geographical
IAformation System of the rivers and flood prone areas will be
developed and linked to the flood forecasting models, in order to
display instantly the areas likely to be flooded, depths of
flooding, etC. under various reservoir and flood management
strategies, Including anticipated breaching.
J * Institutional Strentthening for Flood Modellina and Forecastina.
To ensure the sustainability and the effective use of the improved
flood modelling and forecasting capabilities, present
Institutional arrangements for flood modelling and forecasting
will be reviewed and strengthening measures proposed. Provision
needs to be made to secure continuous maintenance and operation of
the models. Training of staff in the improved modelling and
forecating techniques vill be provided.
k.   Flood Prenaredness and Early Flood Warning. A flood warning
manual will be prepared providing information regarding
vulnerability of villages and are"a likely for various flood
scenarios. Measures to strengthen institutional arrangements for
early flood warning and timely evacuation of vulnerable villages
will be proposed.
3B. XUlamentatoa
An implementation period of three to four years is envisaged for
the completion of all the various upgrading and improvement measures. The
various ag1enies involved in the country's flood forecasting and maaget
and early warning, including the Federal Flood Commission, WAPDA, the
Meteorological Department and the four Provincial Irrigation Departments, will
be fully associated vith the T& implementation.
It is envisaged that the procurement and installation of radar and
telemetry equipment (items a and b), the carrying out of the bathymetric
muweys (part of item c), the flood plain mapping (item d) and the
prefeasibility study for the improvements of hydraulic structures (part of
Item h) will be carried out under the ongoing Flood Protection Sector Project.
The otber activities could be included under a T&.
