APPRAISAL OF THE KIDATU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
SECOND STAGE DEVELOPMENT
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report covers the appraisal of a project required to enable
the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited (TANESCO) to meet the rapidly
growing demand for power in its interconnected system, which provides service
to the Dar es Salaam, Morogoro, Tanga, Arusha and Moshi areas where most of
Tanzania's economic activity and 60% of the population are concentrated.
ii.       The Project comprises the construction of a dam at Mtera Site;
installation of two additional 50-MW units at the existing Kidatu Powerhouse
(as the second and final stage of the development of Kidatu Hydroelectric
Scheme) on the Great Ruaha River and a 90 MVA transformer substation at
Morogoro; and management and engineering consulting services. Construction
of the Project would take about four years from 1976 to 1980.
iii.      The Government of Tanzania has requested assistance from the Bank,
the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) and the Kreditanstalt
fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) in financing the Proiect, which                d  gtitated    cost
US$49i4X million equivalent, with a foraign exchange component of US$63.6 mil-
lion_g4uivalent.  These_coss            interest and oiimmitment charges during
construction.  The Project would be financed by a Tilrd-Window loan of US$30
million equivalent, SIDA grant-of SKr-80 million (US$18.6 million equivalent)
on joint basis, a KfW loan of DM 60 million (US$24.0 million equivalent) on
parallel basis, and TANESCO's internally generated funds (US$18.4 million
equivalent).
iv.       This would be the Bank's third lending operation in the power sector
of Tanzania; the first was Loan 518-TA for US$5.2 million to cover part of
TANESCO's development program for the years 1967 through 1970; the second
Loan 715-TA for US$30 million and a supplementary loan for US$5 million to
cover part of construction of the First Stage of the Kidatu Hydroelectric
Scheme which was completed in 1975. Implementation of TANESCO's construction
program for the past nine years has been satisfactory.
v.        The Borrower would be the Government of Tanzania, which would onlend
the proceeds of the loan to TANESCO, which is a stock company with limited
liability established in 1931. TANESCO is responsible for the generation and
distribution of electricity throughout the country (except Zanzibar). 1/
The Government has held all the company shares since 1964. The management
and about 80% of the senior staff in TANESCO are Tanzanians.  The utility is
reasonably well managed and efficient. The help of consultants is required
for the design and construction of all major works.
1/   Interconnection of the TANESCO and Zanzibar systems and power supply to
Zanzibar by TANESCO are under consideration.



-W ii -
vi.       All contracts to be financed from the proposed joint Third Window
loan and SIDA grant would be awar<led on the basis of international competi-
tive bidding consistent with the Bank/IDA Guidelines for Procurement. Con-
tracts to be financed from the proposed KfW loan are expected to be also
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding.
vii.      TANESCO's operating results had been satisfactory until 1974, when
full effect of fuel oil prices was felt. It became necessary for TANESCO to
implement in June 1976 a 40% incr,ease in average tariff. Tariffs will be
further adjusted as necessary to 1iaintain a rate of return on average reva-
lued net fixed assets in operation of at least 7% in 1977 and thereafter.
Projected financial results indicate that TANESCO would be financially viable.
viii.     If benefits are valued on the basis of electricity tariffs of June
1976 and foreign exchange shadow-priced at 1.35, the returns on the Project and
on the entire Kidatu Scheme would be 19% and 16%, respectively.
ix.       The Project is suitable for a Third Window loan of US$30 million
equivalent.

APPRAISAL OF THE KIDATU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT
SECOND STAGE DEVELOPMENT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania has requested
the Bank, the Swedish International Development Authority (SIDA) and the
Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) of the Federal Republic of Germany to
help finance a US$91.0 million power project, which is a major part of the
1975-1980 development program of the Tanzania Electric Supply Company Limited
(TANESCO). A Third Window loan of US$30.0 million is proposed to be made to
TANESCO. Additionally, a SKr 80.0 million (US$18.6 million equivalent) grant
and a DM 60.0 million (US$24.0 million equivalent) loan are being considered
by SIDA and KfW.
1.02      The Project is basically a continuation of the First Stage Kidatu
Hydroelectric Project, which was appraised in 1970 and jointly financed by
the Bank (Loan 715-TA), SIDA and the Canadian International Development
Authority (CIDA). The First Stage has been completed according to the
original schedule although with substantial cost overruns and has operated
satisfactorily since May 1975. The water intake, headrace tunnel, powerhouse,
control room, tailrace tunnel, switchyard, and all related civil works of the
accessories and auxiliaries had been excavated and constructed according to
the ultimate design which includes provision for the Second Stage.
1.03      The history of the construction of the Kidatu Hydroelectric Scheme
began almost ten years ago when the Government asked the Bank for assistance
in financing the First Stage. A comparative study of the Wami River and
the Great Ruaha River developments, which was jointly undertaken by Balfour
Beatty and Co. Limited of the U.K. and the Swedish Consulting Group (SWECO)
and completed in July 1968, recommended the Kidatu development as the most
economic scheme.
1.04      The Project has been prepared following reconnaissance and pre-
appraisal missions in May and December 1974, a report on the geological
situation and design by a Bank consultant, and a feasibility study dated
February 1975 by SWECO. The Project was appraised in April 1975 by a Bank
mission which consisted of Messrs. I. Tuncay, N. Tin, E. Bolte and R. Bloor
(consultant). The mission was joined by SIDA representatives led by Mr. G.
Hiagnuss on.



II. GENERAL ECONOMY AND THE POIER SECTOR
The Country and the Economy
2.01      The United Republic of TarLzania comprises mainland Tanzania and
Zanzibar. Tanzania has a total area of about 937,000 km . The population
of 14.3 million (in 1974), which is increasing at about 3% annually, is
concentrated in a few regions, with about two-thirds of the people concen-
trated in 10% of the land. Urban population has been growing at over 5%
per annum.
2.02      Tanzania is one of the 25 "least developed" countries; per capita
income was estimated at US$130 in 1973. The economy is based primarily on
agriculture, in which over 90% of the population is engaged, much of it at
the subsistence level. Total GDP in 1974 was estimated to be US$1,494
million, of which agricultural output accounted for approximately 40%,
manufacturing and mining for over 16%, and services for nearly 44%. Between
1968 and 1973, GDP increased 4.8% per annum in real terms.
2.03      In 1973/74, the economy was hard hit by sharp rising import prices,
most particularly oil prices, and by a prolonged drought which substantially
reduced food production and required large increases in imports of basic
food items. The upward trend of import prices and stagnant agricultural
exports should further deteriorate the balance of payments. The Government
has secured financing of the gap through US$30 million Bank Program Loan
of December 20, 1974 (Loan No. 1063-TA) and other multilateral and bilateral
sources.
2.04      The balance of payments problem is likely to persist through the
end of this decade in spite of concentrated Government actions in restructur-
ing its investment program and reducing the growth rate of consumption.
Energy Resources
2.05      The main indigenous energy resource is hydro power.  Most of the
potential is in the basins of eighLt rivers draining into the Indian Ocean,
although there is also scope for hIydro development on three of the rivers
of the Nile system within Tanzania.
2.06      A small quantity of coal is mined in the Songwe-Kiwiri area but
commercially exploitable bulk deposits have yet to be proven. Sizeable
deposits of bituminous coal have been discovered in the north of Lake Nyasa
and the possibility to exploiting them in association with nearby deposits
of iron ore is under study. 1/ Tae rerwteness of this coal field (about
1/  An interest-free loan of T Sh 525 million (US$65.2 million) was provided
in 1974 by the People's Republic of Chi.na, which will be used to finance
the exploitation of coal in Tukuyu and Iron ore deposits in Chunya as
well as a rail link from the area to the Tan-Zam Railway.



- 3 -
750 km from Dar) makes it unlikely that the coal would be economic for
electricity generation in the coastal region in the foreseeable future.
2.07      Firewood is the main fuel in the subsistence sector but is also
used by industry for generating steam. The main commercial form of energy,
however, is oil, some of which is imported as crude and processed in the
refinery at Dar es Salaam, which has a capacity of about one million tons
per annum. The existing diesel power stations and gas turbine use oil fuel
partly supplied from this refinery; their total consumption in 1974 was about
75,000 tons. Oil prospecting, which has been carried on for many years without
success, is continuing in the several areas by AGIP, an Italian oil company
which has exclusive prospecting rights in the coastal sedimentary belt and
the continental shelf.
The Power Sector
2.08      Because it operates almost exclusively in the areas of most inten-
sive development, the power sector has been growing much more rapidly than the
economy as a whole. Sales by TANESCO, which is responsible for power supplies
throughout the country, rose at an average rate of 10% per annum between
1964-1975. Total investment by TANESCO during 1964-1969 amounted to T Sh 276
million (US$39 million 1/) or about 5.7% of the national total of T Sh 4,840
(US$678 million 1/). Power investment in the Government's 1969-1974 plan was
projected at T Sh 457 million (US$64 million 1/) at constant 1968-1969 prices,
which represented about 5.6% of the total planned national investment of
T Sh 8,085 million (US$1,132 million 1/) during the same period.
2.09      Industrial sector accounts for the bulk of electricity consumption.
During 1970-1975, industrial users accounted for about 69% of total energy
sales, followed by the domestic sector with about 18% and the commercial
sector with about 13%. Statistical data on the power sector covering the
period 1964-1975 are shown in Annex 1.
Existing Power Facilities
2.10      Tanzania's current total installed generating capacity is about
266 MW, including 151 MW of hydro, about 100 MW of diesel and steam, and 15 MW
of gas turbine. About 95% of the total installed capacitv belong to TANESCO;
the remaining 5% belong to power users who are out of reach of TANESCO's
supply lines. Plants already under construction and scheduled for commis-
sioning in the period of 1975-1980 will bring TANESCO's installed capacity to
about 355 MW and the country's total to about 375 MW.

2.11      TANESCO has an interconnected power system operating at 220 and 132 kV in
the Coastal and Arusha-Moshi regions, 1/ and supplies energy to Dar es Salaam,
Tanga, Morogoro, Arusha and Moshi. Generation in the system is provided by
four major hydroelectric stations on the Pangani and Great Ruaha Rivers
totalling 146.5 MW, and two diesel stations close to Dar es Salaam totalling
60 MW, which together account for 75'/ of the company's total generating
capacity. One of the diesel stations (Ubungo) includes an extension of 33 MW
financed under Bank Loans 518-TA and 715-TA.
2.12      The remaining 89 MW capacity owned by TANESCO is provided by thermal
generating sets which are mostly diesel and are located at different parts of
the country and 15 hydroelectric sets at five :Locations. Diesel units vary
in size from 40 kW to 7.8 MW and there is a gas-turbine set of 15 MW.
TANESCO's existing facilities are described in greater detail in Annex 2,
and are shown on the map attached to this report.
Access to Electricity
2.13      Of the total population of 14.3 million, about 13.3 million (93%)
live in rural areas, about 600,000 (,4%) in towns and 419,000 (3%) in the
city of Dar es Salaam. Only 950,000 persons (less than 7% of total population)
have access to electricity through 71,570 connections, although about 12%
of the population live in the towns and villages where electricity is avail-
able. Present overall per connection consumption of about 5,500 kWh per
annum and annual per capita consumption of about 70 kWh for domestic users
are low.  Connection density is about 0.25 per 1,000 population in rural areas
and about 65 per 1,000 population in urban areas.
Power Development Program
2.14      Apart from proposed Project which will meet the growing demand in
the interconnected system, TANESCO's development program in the period 1975-
1980 (Annex 5) includes extensions of existing distribution facilities and
construction of a new 18-MW diesel station (financed partly by British Aid)
ten miles from the old diesel plant: at Mwanza, a hydroelectric project (first
stage 10 NW, ultimate capacity about 16 IW) at Kiwira (financed by Russian
Aid), and construction of about twenty small diesel stations in the several
townships.
2.15      A number of projects are under long-term planning, including a
major hydroelectric project with an ultimate capacity of about 600 MW to
1,000 MW at Stiegler's Gorge on the Rufiji River. This project, however,
is intended mainly for very large consumption levels presently beyond
Tanzania's normal requirement and for international power exchanges. TANESCO
is considering possibilities of exporting power to Zanzibar, which has an
existing demand of about 10 IW, and to Kenya.
1/   Coastal and Arusha-Moshi systems were originally constructed separately.
The systems were connected by a 132-kV line (financed by the Government
of Canada) in 1975.



-5-
Rural Electrification
2.16      The Government's program for the electrification of rural areas
basically covers the electrification of "ujamaa villages" (cooperative
villages) with bilateral assistance. Since this operation is generally
expected to be unprofitable, a new organization (Rural Electrification
Corporation) is being established for this purpose. According to a draft
study on the duties and responsibilities for the corporation (prepared by
TANESCO and approved in principle by Ministry of Water Development and Power
(MWDP) and sent to the prime minister's office for consideration), it would
be involved in planning village electrification In connection with the general
power planning of the country by TANESCO. It is intended that TANESCO would
assist in the construction and operation of these village power systems, but
that these facilities would be owned by the new organization and that all
expenditures in excess of revenues would be covered by Government subsidies.
It is also intended that these installations would be turned over to TANESCO
whenever they become commercially viable. This arrangement is satisfactory
as it would not impair TANESCO's principle of commercial viability and would
also make the expertise of the cost-conscious management of TANESCO available
to the subsidized operations of rural electrification.
III. THE PROJECT
Description
3.01      The Project consists of:
(a)  a concrete dam about 45 meters high, which would form a
reservoir adequate for yearly regulation of river water at Mtera;
(b) an extension of the existing Kidatu Hydroelectric generating station
by two 50-MW units (Nos. 3 and 4);
(c) a 220/132-kV, 90-MVA transformer substation at Morogoro;
(d) consulting services; and
(e) training for TANESCO's middle management and professional staff.
3.02      The dam is to be constructed 6 km downstream of the Mtera Bridge,
175 km upstream of the existing Kidatu dam. The selection of the site was
based on favorable ground conditions and reservoir capacity.
3.03      Although there are no competing claims for the waters of the Great
Ruaha River upstream of Kidatu continued availability of water in sufficient
r7. quantities for the Project would be essential. The Government has agreed
j YJ4 that it will not permit substantial abstractions of water from the Great
Ruaha River or its tributaries upstream of Kidatu that would reduce the



potential generating output of the Kidatu station. A more detailed descrip-
tion of the Project is given in Annex 3.
Estimated Cost
3.04      The estimated total cost of the Project: is about T Sh 626 million
(US$77.8 million equivalent) of which T Sh 476 million (US$59.1 million) or
76% would be foreign exchange. These costs are before interest and commitment
charges during construction. The cost estimates are detailed in Annex 4 and
summarized as follows:

3.05      The above cost estimates are exclusive of custom duties, from which
TANESCO would be exempted as in the case of the first-stage Kidatu Project.
The costs of preliminary investigations, which amount to about T Sb 450,000
(US$56,000) and have been covered by a previous SIDA grant, have also been
excluded.
Basis for Estimates
3.06      The above costs are based on SWECO's estimates as revised by the
mission and base costs are stated as of the end of 1975. Physical contingen-
cies of 25% on civil works and 15% on equipment have been added. On the basis
of price escalation estimated by the Bank and in view of the high rate of
inflation in Tanzania, price contingency allowances of 42% on civil works
and 29% on equipment have been provided (see Annex 4 for yearly breakdowns).
On the basis of these estimates, the Project would cost about US$900 per kW.
3.07      The proportion of foreign exchange content in the cost of civil
works (76%) is relatively high and is due to the fact that local contribution
would consist almost entirely of unskilled and semi-skilled manpower and
timber.
3.08      The location and dimension of the dam, waterways, sizes of the
plant and individual generating units, and dimensions of the other major
equipment (such as transformers), have all been determined by SWECO, as a
result of a series of cost optimization studies based on the estimated load
growth in the power system, the prevailing local conditions (hydrological,
geological and topographical), and sound engineering principles.
Loan Amounts
3.09      The proposed Third Window loan of US$30 million equivalent, together
with the SIDA grant of SKr 80 million equivalent and KfW loan of DM 60 million
equivalent would cover about 79% of the total cost of the Project, including
interest and commitment charges during construction to TANESCO. TANESCO
will finance internally the remaining 21%. The available external financing
as a percentage of total cost is high; nevertheless, it is justifiable in
view of the country economic grounds (paragraph 2.04) and the fact that the
proposed Project represents only about 40% of TANESCO's capital works program
during 1975-1980 (Annex 5). The Third Window loan would include about US$600,000
for retroactive financing of consulting services.
Disbursements
3.10      KfW will finance on,a parallel basis the supply and installation of
the turbines, generators and electrical anduiiiecanlfcal equipment at Kidatu and
the transformer substation at Morogoro (Parts A2, A3, A5 and B shown in Annex 4).
The Bank will finance the interest and commitment charges related to its loan
during the project construction period (estimated at about US$3.5 million
equivalent) and will jointly disburse with SIDA on the basis of 10:7 1/ ratio,
1/   (30.0 - 3.5)/18.6 = 26.5/18.6 = 10/7.



- 8 -1
against (1) 100% of the foreign costs of mechanical and electrical equipment
at Mtera, consulting services and training (Parts A4 and C shown in Annex 4),
and (2) 75% of civil works (Part Al excluding consulting services shown in
Annex 4). The estimated disbursement schedule for the proposed loan is shown
in Annex 6.
3.11      In the event that Project costs are lower than estimated, resulting
in total disbursements less than the amount of the proposed loan, the unused
balance of the loan may be used to finance possible expansion of TANESCO's
distribution systems and training facilities. Otherwise, the unused balance
should be cancelled. The Project is expected tc be completed by the end of
1980; the proposed closing date would be December 31, 1981 to allow for final
guarantee payments.
Detail Design and Construction Supervision
3.12      TANESCO has appointed SWECO as engineetring consultants for the
design, preparation of bidding documents, bid evaluation and supervision of
all the works included in the Project. SWECO's performance under Kidatu
First Stage gave rise to difficulties and differences with TANESCO, but
corrective measures have been instituted and TA4ESCO has asked for SWECO
to continue. TANESCO has agreed to strengthen its construction management
-Aa and supervision capability which would be possible with the appointment of
two full-time experts - one to assist the TANESCO construction supervision unit
at the site and the other at the Planning Divis'ion in Dar - and the use of an
,advisor on contractor's claims and a panel of experts for critical review
i}'of detailed engineering design and supervision of construction progress from
time to time as requested by TANESCO and/or Bank.  TANESCO has agreed to
employ the aforementioned two full-time experts by August 1, 1976, appoint
a panel of experts acceptable to the Bank and employ a claims advisor if and
when necessary.    J X /i    o
E  (\3.13      It has been agreed that corLsultants acceptable to the Bank would
continue to be engaged to assist TANESCO in carrying out and supervising
the Project.
Procurement
3.14      All contracts to be financed from the proposed joint Third Window
loan and SIDA grant would be awarded on the basis of international compe-
titive bidding consistent with the Bank/IDA Guidelines for Procurement. Con-
tracts to be financed from the proposed KfW loan are expected to be also
awarded on the basis of international competitive bidding. Bid documents will
be issued within June 1976 for major items of power equipment and for main
civil works related to the construction of the dam. The construction schedule
is given in Annex 7.

Environmental Studies
3.15      A general ecological review of the Kidatu site and Mtera reservoir
was completed in 1970. Following this general review, an in-depth study of
some aspects of the ecology was completed in 1972 during the course of the
construction of Kidatu dam. These studies did not indicate any negative
effects of such magnitude as to impair the feasibility of the damming. A
further in-depth study of the Mtera reservoir is underway. This study, which
is estimated to take about a year, is expected to lead to the development of
measures required to ameliorate any adverse effects and make recommendations
with regard to further development of beneficial effects in the fields of
game preservation, fishing, etc. (see Annex 8). Agreement has been obtained
that the recommendations resulting from this study will be discussed with
t<)J>_ the Bank and appropriate measures will be taken accordingly.
IV. JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROJECT
Market Growth
4.01       The Project would supply additional energy to TANESCO's interconnected
system which includes Dar es Salaam (population 419,000), where most of the
commercial and industrial development in the country is located, as well as
the important urban centers of Tanga (population 77,000), Morogoro (population
34,000), and Arusha (population 38,000). This system accounted for about 90%
of total TANESCO sales in 1974. The average rate of growth of electricity
sales in the system since 1966 has been 10.5% per annum with industrial sales
growing at 14% per annum, commercial sales at 9% per annum and domestic sales
at 8% per annum. Detailed sales figures by consumer category for the main load
centers are shown in Annex 9 together with corresponding trends in maximum
demand and generation.
4.02      The Bank mission prepared a load forecast, which indicates that
the kWh sales growth from the interconnected system would rise from a sup-
pressed 5.6% in 1974 to 7.7% in 1975 and 8.3% in 1976, and would reach an
average of about 102 per annum from 1977 through 1985. This load forecast,
which is detailed in Annex 9, has been based on the expectation that the
Tanzanian economy will recover from the impact of the oil crisis and the
effect of the drought within the next couple of years; that the entire inter-
connected system will maintain a load factor of about 68%; and that transmis-
sion and distribution losses will not exceed the present 15%.
Need for Additional Capacity
4.03       The existing generating facilities comprise a blend of diesel and
hydro generating plants and, since the hydroelectric power stations are all
basically "run of river" developments with the limited pondage Drovided by
Kidatu and Nyumba ya Mungu dams, the flow available for power generation would
be lowest during the dry months (June-October) of the year.



- 10 -
4.04      The projected maximum demand together with the installed and firm
capacity are shown in Annex 10, which demonstrates that, with the recent
commissioning of the first-stage Kidatu Project:, the interconnected svstem
would be capable of meeting capacity requirements until 1980. The average
water year production capability (Annex 11) as well as the dry year produc-
tion capability (Annex 12), together with the lJbungo station generating capa-
bility should also be able to meet the energy demand until 1980. Additional
generating capacity will, therefore, be required to meet the growing power
demand of the interconnected system in 1980.
Comparison of Alternatives
4.05      The alternative to the Project would be another hydro scheme or a
thermal station. Some alternative hydro scheres were examined by the consult-
ants in a series of studies carried out over the past ten years. Most of
these were eliminated from detailed consideration because they were too remote,
too small, or geologically unsatisfactory. The choice was finally narrowed
down to three schemes: (1) Pongwe hydro plant: on the Wami River; (2) Stiegler's
Gorge on Rufiji River; and (3) a Second Stage Development of Kidatu Project.
4.06      Stiegler's Gorge was eliminated because the site could only be
economically developed with much higher capacLty than the TANESCO system
could absorb for many years to come. Wami Scheme had been eliminated by the
comparative study which was jointly prepared lby Balfour, Beatty and Co. Ltd.
of U.K. and SWECO of Sweden in 1971 because of higher cost.  In fact, the
Kidatu scheme has been developed and all main civil works (such as headrace
and tailrace tunnels, penstocks ancl cable shaft, large underground powerhouse
and transformer hall, control room and all other auxiliaries except the Mtera
dam) have already been constructed for the ultimate capacity which includes
the proposed second stage Project.
4.07      The Second Stage Kidatu Scheme was therefore chosen as the prefer-
red hydro development and compared with an alternative thermal development
based on a diesel station followed by steam units at Dar es Salaam using
residual fuel oil. The alternative of delaying the construction of the
proposed Project by an interim installation of thermal sets (diesel units)
were also considered.
4.08      Annex 13 gives a comparison of three alternatives, summarized as
follows:
Alternative 1: The proposed Project;
Alternative 2: Thermal--hydro blend with a postoonement
of the proposed Project by two years: and
Alternative 3: Thermal alternative.



4.09      The analyses indicate that Alternative 1 (the proposed Project)
would be preferred over Alternative 2 (thermal-hydro blend) at discount rates
up to 14% and that Alternative 3 (thermal) is the most expensive and would
only be economic at discount rates higher than 23%. The sensitivity of
these discount rates to different assumptions about the main variables
(capital costs, oil price, load growth) has been tested and described in
Annex 13. An increase of 50% in civil works costs or a slow drop in fuel
prices of 2% per annum in real terms from end-1974 through 1980 would reduce
the equalizing discount rates between Alternatives 1 and 2 to 12% and between
Alternatives 1 and 3 to about 18%. A reduction in load growth by 10% would
also lower the equalizing discount rate between Alternatives 1 and 3 to 20%
but would not materially affect the equalizing discount rate between Alter-
natives 1 and 2.
Return on Investment
4.10      The return on the Project, taken to be the discount rate at which
the present worth of all capital and operating costs (excluding taxes) equals
the present worth of all revenues associated with the Project over its life-
time, has been found to be 23% (Annex 14). Since the Project is the second
and final stage of the Kidatu hydroelectric development scheme and major
excavation and civil works at Kidatu have already been completed under the
first-stage Project, it would be appropriate to consider the return on the
entire Kidatu scheme (i.e., two stages combined), which has been calculated
to be 21%.
4.11      If foreign exchange is shadow-priced at 1.35, the returns on the
Project and on the entire Kidatu scheme would be 19% and 16%, respectively.
These returns do not measure adequately the merit of the Project, but do
provide a rough indication of the appropriateness of the average tariff level.
The 16% is higher than the probable opportunity cost of capital to Tanzania
and, therefore, indicates that tariffs on the average exceed the long-run
marginal cost of power supply. While this tariff level is necessary for
TANESCO to meet its financial needs (paragraphs 6.10 and 6.11), changes in tariff
structure may be justified, so that the incremental costs of different cate-
gories of consumption should be reflected in the prices charged. Such a
pricing policy would help to bring about an optimal rate of system expansion
in the future.

V. THE BENEFICIARY - TANZANIA ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY LIMITED
The Borrower and Beneficiary
5.01      The Government of Tanzania will be the borrower.  The proceeds of
the proposed Third Window loan will be onlent to the Tanzania Electric Supply
Company Limited (TANESCO). TANESCO was founded as a private company in 1931
and was acquired by the Government of Tanzania in 1964 through purchase from
the East African Power and Lighting ('ompany Limited (EAP&L) of Kenya of all
issued shares other than those alreacly held by the Government. Payments for
these shares were made over a twelve--year period and completed by the end of
1975. TANESCO has been made responsible for the development of the country's
power industry; it has functioned as the sole organization for the public
generation and distribution of electricity throughout mainland Tanzania. It
operates in accordance with commercial principles.
Company's Memorandum of Association and Licenses
5.02      The Company's licenses were issued in 1957 under Electricity
Ordinance No. 3 and expire in 2012. They provide for it to have the first
refusal of any additional areas to be licensed for public supplies of elec-
tricity in Tanzania. The licenses define areas of "compulsory supply" within
which the Company is obliged to provide a supply upon payment of the required
charges by the consumers, and lay down maximum rates for the sale of energy
for lighting and power. The maximum rates prescribed in the 1957 license
are T Sh 0.60 per kWh for power and r Sh 1.20 per kWh for lighting. These
maximum rates would be either abolished or raised when necessary.
Organization, Management and Staff
5.03      In 1973, TANESCO was reorganized along functional lines based on
the recommendations of a study carried out by Scandiaconsult, a Swedish firm.
This reorganization also aimed at giving more operational and construction
responsibilities to regional levels. The present organizational structure
is shown in Annex 15.
5.04      TANESCO is a parastatal under the sponsorship of the Ministry of
Water Development, Energy and Minerals (MWDEM). The Board of Directors consists
of a chairman, who is the Minister of MWDEM, arLd ten other members: three rep-
resentatives of various ministries, two representatives of the industrial and
banking sectors, two members of the Parliament, one university professor, one
representative of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU), and the general
manager of TANESCO. The Board meets about every two months. Day-to-day
operations are under the direction of a general manager, who is assisted by
a deputy general manager and six division managers.



- 13 -
5.05      The present general manager, who has ably served since early 1973,
is the first Tanzanian appointed to this position. As TANESCO's general
manager is a presidential appointment, it has been agreed that the Govern-
ment and the Bank would review from time to time the qualifications and
experience that would be regarded as appropriate for appointments to this
position.
5.06      TANESCO is reasonably well-managed and, at the same time, has been
quite successful in filling most of its senior and managerial positions with
qualified Tanzanian staff in accordance with the government's general Tanza-
nianization policy. TANESCO employed 17 expatriates at the time of appraisal,
two on a permanent basis and the rest on two-year contracts, as compared to
a total of 50 five years ago. This has been brought about by a well-planned
training and sponsorship program which has been initiated, administered and
partly funded by TANESCO during the past ten years. TANESCO currently has a
3,000-work force, which is adequate.
5.07      With a view to further strengthening TANESCO, the proposed Project
includes provision (US$400,000) for the training of its middle-management and
professional staff in the areas of power systems planning, design and opera-
tions, accounting and financial management.  It has been agreed that TANESCO
will submit to the Bank a training program by June 30, 1976. The Bank is ex-
pected to assist in the selection of candidates and in the preparation and
arrangement of individual training programs.
Accounting and Audit
5.08      TANESCO's accounts, which are presented in accordance with public
utility practice and maintained on a current basis, are computerized.
Audited annual statements have been prepared more or less within the period
(four months after the close of the financial year) required under Loan 715-
TA. It has been agreed that TANESCO will submit its audited annual accounts
> within five months after the close of the financial year.
\-,N
9- /5.09         Since 1971, the government-owned Tanzania Audit Corporation (TAC)
'    has been auditing TANESCO's accounts.  The quality of TAC's audits has
improved markedly during the past two years, when TAC succeeded in recruiting
a number of qualified staff with bilateral assistance.  It has been agreed
'1--,,that TANESCO will continue to employ auditors satisfactory to the Bank.
Billing and Collection
5.10      Meter readings are made monthly and sent to the head office in Dar
for processing of bills by computer. Payments of bills are made through a
number of offices and collecting agents. TANESCO has maintained an acceptable
collection record during the past four years; its accounts receivable has been
equivalent to about 70 average day's billings.



- 14 -
Insurance
5.11      Insurance of TANESCO's major assets against the hazards of fire,
etc. is considered adequate. It is effected through the National Insurance
Corporation, the sole government-owned insurance company. This company in
turn reinsures through European insurance market.
Project Monitoring System
5.12      Important project monitoring aspects will be progress of construction
against a CPM (to be submitted by the consultants by December 1976) and
implementation of new cost reflecting tariff structure against set target
dates for installation of new metering equipment. Proposed guidelines for a
project monitoring system are given in Annex 24.
Risks
5.13      No major risks have so far been identified with regard to the
physical execution of the Project. However, on financial and managerial
aspects there could be problems. On the financial side, there is some danger
that the 40% tariff increase (paragraph 6.10) may depress the electri-
city demand and, as a result, TANESCO's internal cash generation may be less
than projected. However, this risk would be minimized because the tariff
structure allows cross-subsidization between the poor domestic consumers and
others - most notably the industrial consumers, which presently account for
69% of TANESCO's total energy salets. On the management side, the problem
lies in middle echelons of the hierarchy; staff in these positions may not
yet have sufficient experiences to cope with unusual difficulties without
close supervision of present top management. Continuation of effective top
management is, therefore, essential. The training component of the Project
should in time improve the situat:Lon.
VI. FINANCIAL ASPECTS
Present Financial Position
6.01      TANESCO's actual balance sheets for 1970 to 1974 are shown in
Annex 16. The financial position at December 31, 1974 is summarized as
follows:

6.02      TANESCO's debt-equity ratio of 50/50 as of December 31, 1974 in-
dicated a satisfactory capital structure. Its current position at the same
date was weak, as evidenced by a current ratio of 0.79 and a negative cash
balance of T Sh 3.1 million, which was mainly caused by the inadequate operat-
ing results during 1974 (paragraphs 6.04 and 6.05) and the Government's delay



- 16 -
in providing TANESCO with certain equity funds (totalling T Sh 23.6 million
toward meeting the local costs of the Kidatu/Ubungo and Hale/Moshi trans-
mission lines as required under agreements with CIDA). TANESCO's liquidity
problem was further aggravated as overdrafts subsequently rose to nearly
T Sh 19 million, but was completely liquidated in May 1975 when the Government
agreed to inject the equity funds.
6.03      The long-term debt shown in paragraph 6.01 includes a debenture
stock of T Sh 32.6 million held by the Commonwealth Development Corporation.
This debt was incurred in 1961 in connection with the construction of the
liale Hydroelectric station and is repayable in 17 annual installments ending
in 1985 and secured by a first mortgage on al:L then existing freehold and
leasehold properties of TANESCO and on all such property acquired in connec-
tion with the Hale project, plus a floating charge over all other properties
of TANESCO owned at that time or subsequently acquired. In order to provide
adequate security under these conditions for Bank Loans Nos. 518-TA and
715-TA, it was necessary to open up the exist:Lng mortgage deed so as to in-
clude the Bank Loans in the security on a pari passu basis. It would not be
necessary, however, to include the proposed loan in the existing mortgage in
view of the fact that the proposed loan will be made to, and hence guaranteed
by the Government.
Past Operating Results
6.04      TANESCO's income statements for the five years ending December 31,
1974 are given in Annex 17 and sumnarized below:

6.05      The above table indicates clearly that TA.NESCO enjoyed a period of
adequate earnings until 1974 when fuel prices sharply increased (diesel oil
by 1407% and furnace oil by 200%).  A dry spe:Ll limited hydro generation and
repeated failures of the diesel units and the gas turbine at the Ubungo sta-
tion also contributed to the deterioration of TANESCO's profitability in that
"ear.  As a result, the rate of return on average net operating assets dropped



- 17 -
from 13.4% in 1973 to 6.3%, or 3.7% if based on revalued assets (paragraph
6.07) in 1974, in spite of a 30% across the-board tariff surcharge effective
April 1, 1974.  Section 5.07 (a) (ii)    the Joint n np_ Agreement for
Loan 715-TA requires a minimum antiKl r-eturn of 10% UD through 19774  iU7%g
thereafter.
6.06      TANESCO's cash flow statements for 1970-1974, shown in Annex 18,
indicate that its net internally generated cash accounted for about 16.5%
of the total financing required during this five-year period. This is satis-
factory, particularly in view of the fact that its total assets more than
doubled in real terms during these five years.
Revaluation of Assets
6.07      The fixed assets, which are shown in paragraph 6.01, are stated at
historical costs. In 1975 TANESCO has agreed and, with Bank assistance,
prepared a study concerning the revaluation of these assets to take account
of rising replacement costs. The proposed revaluation, which is summarized
in Annex 19, has been based on changes in price levels; the price index used
for the revaluation purpose is the average of the "Retail Price Index - Wage
Earners" and the "Cost of Living Index - Middle Grade Civil Servants", both
of which are published on a current basis bv the Bank of Tanzania in its
Quarterly Economic Bulletins. As a result of this revaluation, TANESCO's
fixed assets as of December 31, 1974 are as follows, when expressed in 1974
prices:
Historical Costs          Revalued
(T Sh Thousand)
Cross Fixed Assets in Operation               444,815                 732,552
Less: Accumulated Depreciation                184,832                 285,018
Net Fixed Assets in Operation                 259,983                  447,534
N   6.08      The above revaluation has been confirmed in a supplementary letter.
It has been agreed that TANESCO's fixed assets would be revalued bi-annually
>  based on the average price index for non-food items described in paragraph
6.07, or a similar index agreeable to the Bank.
Tariffs
6.09      TANESCO requested Government approval of a 12% tariff increase in
December 1974 in an attempt to meet the 7% minimum rate of return required
for 1975 under Loan 715-TA, but decision was postponed repeatedly.
6.10      The Government finally approved a tariff increase of 40%' e&fective
June 1976. In order to enable TANESCO to generate sufficient funds for its



-18 -
needs, agreement has been reached that tariffs will be adjusted from time to
time for TANESCO to maintain a rate of return on average revalued net fixed
assets in operation of at least 7% in 1977 and thereafter.
6.11      A tariff study is being undertaken with Bank assistance with a view
to recommending a cost-reflecting tariff structure. Agreement has been
reached that the recommended tariff structure will be reviewed with the Bank
and implemented as agreed by December 1, 1976.
Financing Plan

6.13      The proposed Third Window loan of US$30.0 million, SIDA grant of
US$18.6 million equivalent and KfW loan of US$24.0 million equivalent will
provide about 33.7% of the financing required. Government's equity contri-
bution of US$28.2 million equivalent, together with consumer contribution and
other borrowings totalling US$45.5 million equivalent, account for 34.1% of
the financing required. The balance of the financing required, which amounts
to US$69.4 million equivalent or 32.2% will be provided from TANESCO's net
internal cash generation.  This financing plan is satisfactory.  However, to
*- t> assure that the Project will not be delayed because of unexpected shortage of
Xfunds, agreements have been reached (a) that the present dividend rate of
86-2/3% paid to Government on the ordinary stock will not be increased and
b) that, in the event of a shortage of funds, the Government will supply
t W 5iTAINESCO with such funds as necessary to carry out the timely completion of
the Project, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank.
6.14      It has been assumed that the Third Window loan will be onlent to
TANESCO at interest rate of 8.85% for 25 years including five years of grace.
It has also been assumed that the Government wi4i onlend to TANESCO the pro-
ceeds-of -the -SIDA grant and the KfW loan at Bank terms.  The Third Window
loan, SIDA grant and KfW loan would be mutually effective.
Future Operations and Financial Position
6.15      The projected Income Statements and Balance Sheets for the years
1975 through 1982 are shown in Annexes 20 and 22. The assumptions for these
financial projections are given in Annex 23. It should be noted that fixed
assets have been revalued bi-annually on the basis of the price index men-
tioned in paragraph 6.07, which has been estimated to increase by 20% in 1975,
18% in 1976, 15% in 1977 and 12% each year from 1978 through 1980. There-
after, prices are assumed to remain constant.
6.16      The income projections shown in Annex 20 indicatps that, with
future nominal increases of about 17% in 1978 and 16% in 1980, TANESCO would
earn rates of return on revalued net operating assets between 6.6% and 7.7%
during 1977-1982.
6.17      TANESCO's debt-equity ratio will improve from 44:56 in 1975 to
38:62 in 1980, when the Project is commissioned and to 34:66 in 1982. Debt
service coverage is expected to vary between 1.5 and 2.3 during 1975-1982.
Nevertheless, to ensure that adequate debt service coverage will be maintained,
(f 1 agreement has been reached that TANESCO will not incur any debts other than
those included in financing plan (paragraph 6.12) unless internal cash gene-
/   ration is at least 1.5 times maximum future debt service, including debt
V'    service on the proposed borrowings.

TANESCO's Existing Power- Facilities
1.        TANESCO has an interconnected power system operating at 220 kV and
132 kV, which comprises the Coastal and Arusha-Moshi systems connected to each
other by a 270 km of 132-kV tie-line between Hale and Moshi in 1975. This
system accounts for 89% of the Company's installed generating capacity, 75%
of its 71,563 electricity consumers, and about 86% of its total 1974 sales of
459 million kWh. These figures reflect the concentration of urban population
and general economic activity irL the Coastal and Arusha-Moshi regions. Other
population centers with considerable economic activity are:  the Mwanza area
in the Lake Victoria region (7 MW) and the Dodoma area (3 MW).  Ten other pop-
ulation centers have public supplies of electricity, with generating equipment
ranging from 105 kM to 2,000 kW installed capacity.  The locations of the
interconnected power system and of the other centers with public supplies are
shown on the map attached to thet report.
2.        Hydroelectric power pLant owned by TANESCO has a total capacity of
151 MW, consisting mainly of 100 MW at Kidatu, 21 MW at Hale, 17.5 MW at
Pangani Falls, 8 MW at Nyumba-ya-Mungu and 5 MW at other four locations.
Kidatu is on the Great Ruaha River; Hale and Pagani are the Pagani River. The
Pagani Falls station built in 1934 and the Hale Station built in 1964 are
run-of-river tpe with limited pondage, but Kidatu has a larger reservoir
(125 million m ) built in 1975, capable of monthly regulation. The flow of
Pangani River is controlled upstream at Nyum a-ya-Mungu where a dam creating
a multi-purpose reservoir of 1,500 million m was constructed in 1967. The
Nyumba-ya-Mungu Power Station was added in 1969.  A small hydro-electric sta-
tion of 1.2 MW built in 1935 at Kikuletwa on the Pangani River is connected to
the town of Moshi network. Another small hydroelectric plant of 0.3 MW on the
Mwanya River has been supplying the town cf Mbeya since 1958.
3.        The remaining 100 MW capacity owmed by TANESCO is provided by many
diesel generating sets, at different locations. These units vary in size from
40 kW to 7,500 kW. Under Bank Loans 518-TA and 715-TA, the Ubungo station has
been extended with three 6,100 kW and two 7,500 kW units respectively. The
installed capacity, maximum demands and kWh sales for 1974 at all major towns
are shown on page 3 of this Annex.



ANNEX 2
Page 2 of 3
4.        The coastal system is interconnected by means of 132-kV and 220-kV
single circuit transmission lines on galvanized steel towers totalling about
700 km and 312 km in length respectively. In the interconnected system a
66-kV line and 118 km in length carries power from the stations to the load
centers in the North. The operating voltages for the bulk power transmission
system are 220 kV and 132 kV and for the secondary transmission lines are stan-
dardized at 33 kV. For distribution networks two standard voltages (11,000
and 400/200 volts) are adopted. Total length of transmission line is about
5,110 Km. In spite of long transmission distances and high incidence of light-
ing, the reliability of supply is well maintained; reactors and capacitors have
been provided for better voltage regulation and stability. Transmission and
distribution losses, expressed as a fraction of units sent out, are 15%, which
is satisfactory.
5.        TANESCO's transmission system is shown on the map attached to the
report.

KIDATU hYDROELECTRIC PROJECT - SECOND STAGE DEVELOPMENT
TANZANIA ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY LIMITED
Description of Kidatu Hydroelectric Development
Topography and Hydrology
1.         The Great Ruaha River, an important tributary of the Rufiji River,
rises in the mountainous southwestern region of Tanzania, close to the northern
tip of Lake Nyasa where the rainfall is one of the heaviest in the country.
From there it flows in a northeasterly direction until it reaches Mtera, where
other major tributaries join it and the flow turns in a southeasterly direc-
tion. The river falls 175 m over a distance of 34 km before it reaches the
Mikumi-Ifakara road bridge at Kidatu and then it enters a long flat plain
flowing at a gentle gradient in mainly easterly direction until it joins the
Rufiji River.
2.         At Kidatu, wherI the power station is located, the average flow of
Great Ruaha River is 191 m /sec which corresponds to a theoretical annual
flow of 6,025 million i3. However, direct discharge measurements obtained
over a period of 14 years, from 1954 to 1968 (and supplemented by earlier
rainfall measurements), show that the annual flow varies from year to year
between 1,665 million m3 and 17,650 million m3.  In addition to these annual
variations, the discharge figures show a greater seasonal variation. Between
wet and dry months of the same year, the discharge variations may show a ratio
of as high as 100 to 1.
Dam and Spillway
3.         The first stage of the Kidatu Hydroelectric development, based on
these topographic and hydrological conditions, consists of an earth-fill dam
11 km upstream of the Mikumi-Ifakara road bridge, with a maximum height above
the river bed of 37 m and a total crest length of 350 m. The dam provides
a live storage of 125 million m3 at a drawdown of 17 m.  On the river s right
bank, a concrete spillway has been constructed with radial gates capable of
passing a discharge of 7,500 m3/sec, which is the calculated 10,000 year flood.
4.         The proposed second stage of the Kidatu Hydroelectric development
includes the construction of a concrete dam located 6 km downstream of the
Mftera bridge on Dodoma-Iringa highway, with a maximum height above the river
bed of 47 m and a total crest length of 260 m. The dam would provide a live



ANNEX 3
Page 2 of 4
storage of 3,200 million m3 at a drawdown of 8.5 m, which in turn would pro-
vide a regulated river flow during dry seasons sufficient for the requirements
of the project.  On the river's leEt bank, a concrete spillway would 3be con-
structed with radial gates capable of passing a discharge of 4,000 m /sec,
which is the calculated 10,000 year flood.
Reservoir
5.        The reservoir created by the dam at Mtera would be2a sprawling,
shallow body of water which would shrink in area from 610 km to 190 km during
the proposed 8.5 m drawndown. Aside from power generation purpose, the Mtera
reservoir is also expected to be of value for fishery development. The water
from this reservoir and the runoff from the catchment between Mtera and Kidatu
would provide an average monthly flow of at least 85 m /sec for Kidatu plant
even during dry years.
Power Plant
6.        At the existing Kidatu station, the water is being conveyed from the
Kidatu reservoir to the turbines through a concrete intake structure, a head-
race tunnel, and two vertical pens tocks. Thie intake structure is located on
the right bank of the river just upstream of the dam and has been provided
with trash racks and a vertical lift gate. The headrade tunnel is 10 km in
length, partially lined and heavily gunited and bolted. At the downstream end
of the tunnel, a surge gallery has; been provided. Only two of the penstocks
have been provided with steel lining and cylindrical gates during the first
stage construction and the other two shafts would be so provided in the pro-
ject.
7.        The two existing Francis type turbines, which are being operated
under a maximum net head of about 172 n in an underground station 200 m below
ground, have been coupled to two generators, each of 50 MW rating. Two addi-
tional turbine-generator units similar to the existing ones 'ould be provided
for the under the Project. Water discharges (nominally 38 m /slc for each set)
from the turbines to a tailrace tunnel 900 m in length and 80 m  in cross-
sectional area. This tunnel joins the river via a short tailrace canal just
upstream of the road bridge.
8.        In the Kidatu powerhouse, two additional sets of 3-single phase,
220-kV, 60 WVA transformers, one set for each generating unit, would also be
placed underground in separate rojms adjacent to the main machinery hall.
Power from the new transformers would be carried by a set of 220 kV cables
to be located in the existing vertical shaft to the existing pothead arrange-
ment at ground surface, where it would be transmitted by the existing outdoor
switchyard situated near the Kidatu bridge. The existing single circuit,
312-km, 220-kV transmission line would also transmit the additional power
(to be supplied by the project) to a stepdoxm substation to be constructed at
Ubungo on the outskirt of Dar es Salaan.



ANNEX 3
Page 3 of 4
9.         Although the capacity of the above-mentioned 220-kV Kidatu-Ubungo
line is sufficient to carry additional power, load flow and transient stabil-
ity studies have shown that a 220/132-kV, 90-MVA transformer station at
Morogoro would be necessary for better reactive load distribution and system
voltage regulation to obtain better stability for higher load transportation
and to reduce system losses. Such a transformer station has, therefore, been
included in the project.
Utilization
10.        The useable kWh units to be generated by the Kidatu first stage
(first and second units) and Kidatu second stage (third and fourth units -
the project during the years 1975 to 1989 are shown in the table below. SWECO
has made extensive simulation studies for each of the years included in this
table to determine the number of units that may be generated from the Kidatu
power plant to meet the corresponding estimated load (forecast by the Bank
mission). This was done by applying the water flow conditions of the Great
Ruaha River during the observed 20 year-period (1954 to 1974), which included
considerably wet as well as considerably dry conditions. The table shows,
for each year, the average value of the 20 different annual production figures
so calculated.

KIDATU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT - SECONI) STAGE DEVELOPMENT
Environmental Aspects of the Project
1.        While the addition of two units to the existing two at the Kidatu
station is not expected to have any adverse environmental effects, the con-
struction and operation of the Mtera reservoir 175 km upstream will undoubt-
edly give both positive and negative results which, at this time, are impos-
sible to quantify. The physical effects are itwofold: the creation of the
reservoir itself and the impact of partial regulation of the river on the
large area between the dam and the Kidatu station. The evaluation which follows
results from discussions in Dar es Salaam during project appraisal with
Professors Olov Hedberg and Dick Johanson of Uppsala University who were in
charge of the ecological survey teaLm financed by SIDA.
Implanting
2.        The closing of the Mtera Dam implies that some 600 km  of present
rangeland will be submerged during much of the year so that its present veget-
ation is killed and the grazing area for cattle is much reduced. This reduc-
tion will at least partly be compensated for by the planting of suitable shore
side grasses, sedges and other plants which would be planted along the margin
of the reservoir. Such vegetation is expected to be developed between the
high water line and a depth of about 2 to 3 m. Below this level the bottom
is expected to remain largely bare..
Foreshore Agriculture
3.        The water shored in the soil when the lake level sinks will be suffi-
cient for development of foreshore agriculture in part of the area, possibly
using overhead irrigation with water from the semi-isolated northern appendix
of the reservoir.
Fisheries
4.        The limnological studies performed for the Project indicate consid-
erable fish-producing potential for the Mtera reservoir, and preparations for
development of fisheries are well tinder way.
Wave Action
The comparatively large area of the reservoir at full supply level
implies that wave action will be noticeable on exposed shores, which means
that special precautions may be needed to protect the boats on such steep



ANNEX 8
Page 2 of 3
shores where human habitations are located. The sheltered position of the
Dam site will, however, protect the Dam itself from strong wave action, and
the shoreline erosion is not expected to cause any complications.
Erosion and Sedimentation
6.         Much more serious for the area as a whole is the intense erosion
occurring inTlarge parts of it as a result of over stocking with cattle and
overgrazing (there has been estimated to be some 300,000 head of cattle in
the entire catchment area of Great Ruaha River, and towards the end of the dry
season the grass vegetation is entirely eliminated over vast areas). Unless
this regressive development is retarded, irreversible destruction of the shores
will occur over large areas, accompanied by large-scale silting in the reser-
voir. It is therefore planned to make a detailed study of soil erosion, veg-
etation and sedimentation in the catchment area in order to provide a rational
b`a5ckground for improved management.
Aquatic Weeds
7.         A great menace in many reservoirs has been the proliferation of
floating weeds, notably the water hyacinth (Eichhornea crassipes) and the water
fern (Salvinia Curiculata). Preparations will be made to eradicate the first,
should it be introduced, whereas the best measures to avoid excessive vegeta-
tion of the second one seems to be to remove all trees from the area to be
inundated.
Floating Islands
8.         Another menace that may occur is the appearance of floating "sudd"
islands. 1/ The construction of the spillways will be made in such a way as to
allow for flushing out of these when required.
Relocation and Multi-Purpose Planning
9.         Probably no other aspect has been beset by so many mistakes and
difficulties in earlier damming projects as the relocation of the people in-
habiting the area to be drowned, and considerable attention has therefore been
devoted to this question. The number of people affected was at first estimated
to about 3,000, but a detailed sociological survey demonstrates that most of
these people live above the high-water level of the reservoir. Quite apart
from proposed project, the bulk of the population of this area will be moved
into "ujamaa villages" in other areas by the regional and district government.

large rivers of Africa.



ANNEX 8
Page 3 of 3
In order to contribute to multi-purpose planning and optimum use of the new
conditions (regarding fisheries and tourism), after the damming, TANESCO should
be in touch with Devplan as well as district and local planning authorities.
Diseases
10.       The most severe problem raised by this damming concerns human dis-
eases - notably bilharzia. No earlier big enterprise in the tropics has man-
aged to avoid this, and both disease and vectors occur in the vicinity. The
best way to mitigate its influence will presumably be to locate human habita-
tions on the lake as far as possible to steep and exposed shores unsuitable
for the snails which are intermediate hosts. Furthermore, adequate hygienic
arrangements should be made and health education should be given to all in-
habitants, and health screening provided for everybody.
11.       Sleeping sickness does not occur in the area nor do tsetse flies.
River blindness occurs in nearby parts of the country but, according to the
specialist consulted, the black Ely vectors are unlikely to occur at Mtera.
Specialist studies have been made or are under way for all the major diseases.
Ecological Studies Completed or Under Way
12.       About thirty-five ecological sub-subjects are being studied under
eight main branches of environmental aspects of "Vegetation and Wildlife",
"Soil Erosion, Vegetation and Sedimentation", "Implanting", "Limnology",
"Fisheries", "Disease Ecology", "Sociologic:al Survey", "Multipurpose Planning,
Relocation and Rehabilitation".
13.       Reports on some sub-subjects have been prepared and submitted to
the Government.

TANZANIA
KIDATU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT - SECOND STAGE DEVELOPMENT
Comparison of the Project with Alternative Thermal and
Thermal-Hydro Blend Developments
Selected Alternatives
1.        Selection of the next step of expand:ing TANESCO's generating cap-
acity involves the economic analysis of different possible development strat-
egies which would satisfy the increasing demand in the interconnected power
system over the planning period. The cost stresams of these different strate-
gies have been compared, and the development program which includes Kidatu
Second Stage as the first step proves to be the most economic alternative.
This program provides for the commissioning of Mtera Dam in 1980, with two
hydro units of 50-MW each at the existing Kidatu Power Station (Alternative
No. 1). The total cost of the program includes operation and maintenance.
This program is characterized by high expenditures during the first years of
the planning period, due to the construction costs of the Mtera Dam and two
hydro units and low expenditures after 1980 because of very limited running
costs (no fuel cost). The total cost of the program also includes the cost
of the diesel units and steam units and their related running costs which would
be required to satisfy the system demand over the entire life of the proposed
project.
2.        The main alternative program for the development of the interconnected
system would commence with three diesel sets of 8 MW each, two to be installed
in 1980 and the third in 1980, with the commissioning of Kidatu 3rd and 4th
hydro units (55 MW each) postponed until 1982 (by two years). This program
(Alternative No. 2) would have low expenditures during the first years of the
planning period, but high expenditures in the running costs to cover the system
energy requirement in 1980 and 1981.
3.        A third alternative is the replacement of the Kidatu Second Stage
by the construction of diesel and steam units, It should be noted that system
load growth would not allow installation of steam units (fuel-oil fired) until
1984 because of higher installation costs and a low plant load factor (Alterna-
tive No. 3).
Other Possible Alternatives
4.        Other thermal-hydro blend alternatives (by changing the commissioning
years of thermal and hydro units) have also been considered but these alterna-
tives are either equivalent to one of the above mentioned alternatives or have
a present cost of between those of alternatives of No. 2 and No. 3 at discount
rates of 4% to 25%.

Method of Comparison
5.        The alternative plans have been extended over a period of 62 years
to attain a common facility point and also to reach a point of insignificance
for the present worth factor.
6.        Equalizing Discount Rates (EDR) among the basic cost streams of the
selected alternatives, namely:
Alternative No. 1:        The Project;
Alternative No. 2:        Postponement of the Project by two
years; and
Alternative No. 3:        Replacement of the Project by diesel
and steam units (thermal alternative),
are as follows:
Alternative No. 1 would be cheaper than Alternative No. 2 at
discount rates of less than 14% and
Alternative No. 1 would be cheaper than Alternative No. 3 at
discount rates of less than 23%.
7.        The sensitivity of the equalizing discount rates to changes in the
major variables (capital costs, operating costs, load growth) was tested as
follows:
Capital Cost
8.        It was considered unlikely that the mission's capital cost estimates
for the hydro and thermal schemes would be exceeded, since we include adequate
allowances for possible additional works and contingencies (25% for civil works
and 15% for equipment), but the effects of increasing civil works cost by 33%
and 50% have also been considered. Results are as follow:
a)   Civil Works cost increased by 33%:
Alternative No. 1 would be cheaper than Alternative No. 2
at discount rates lower than 12%;
Alternative No. I would be cheaper than Alternative No. 3
at discount rates lower than 20%.
b)   Civil works cost increased by 50%:
Alternative No. 1 would be cheaper than Alternative No. 2
at discount rates lower than 12%;
Alternative No. 1 would be cheaper than Alternative No. 3
at discount rates lower than 18%.

Oil Price
9.        A slow drop of 2% per year through 19180 in "real" fuel prices from
its end 1974 level of T Sh 500 per metric ton of furnace oil in Dar es Salaam
would result in the following EDRs:
Alternative No. 1 would be cheaper than Alternative No. 2
at discount rates lower than 12%' and
Alternative No. 1 would be cheaper than Alternative No. 3
at discount rates lower than 18%.
Load Growth
10.       The growth of demand has been project:ed on the basis of a detailed
analysis of future electricity consuLmption of Large industrial consumers and
on the correlation between demand of the remaining consumers and the expected
development of Tanzania's economy. If the expectation of economic growth in
Tanzania is too optimistic, then the load growth could be lower than projected.
A lower load growth would lead to a reduction in fuel consumption if the Pro-
ject postponed by the installation of diesel sets. A reduction in load growth
by 10% would reduce the EDRs as follows:
Alternative No. 1 would be cheaper than Alternative No. 2
at discount rates lower than 14%; and
Alternative No. 1 would be cheaper than Alternative No. 3
at discount rates lower than 20%.
Simultaneous Occurrence of Unfavorable Situations
11.       A simultaneous occurrence of two of the three events analyzed above
(i.e., 50% increase in civil works cost, a 2% p.a. drop in "real" fuel prices,
a 10% lower demand growth) would reduce the EDR as follows.
Alternative No. 1 would be cheaper than Alternative No. 3 at discount
rates lower than 14%. However, the likelihoodl of a simultaneous occurrence is
small. The mission estimates that the likelihood of a drop in load growth by
10% is 25%; of 50% higher capital cost of civiLl works 10%, and of a 2% p.a.
drop in "real" fuel prices 30%. The joint probability of simultaneous occur-
rence of three events would be, therefore, less than 8%.

Kidatu Hydroelectric Project - Second Stage Development
Return on Investment
1.         The return on investment for the Project is defined as the discount
rate at which the present worth of the estimated capital and operating costs
of the total hydroelectric development over its life equals the present worth
of revenues attributable to it.
2.         Capital costs are assumed to consist of the estimated expenditures
for constructing Mtera Dam, increase of the Kidatu Station capacity, transformer
station at Morogoro and the estimated expenditures required to extend the
distribution networks within the coastal system sufficient to absorb the power
generated by these additional units. Yearly capital outlays are included in
the cost stream which is extended over 66 years (expected life of the civil
engineering works). Generators are assumed to be rewound after 30 years of
operation. (however, the renewals for distribution are not repeated since the
discount factors become exceedingly small after the 60th year and the effect
on the equalizing rate of discount becomes negligible. Plant renewal planning
and costs are assumed to be the same as the original planning and costs).
3.         Additional operating costs of the Kidatu extension, Mtera Dam and
transmission-distribution are very small (no fuel costs), estimated at about
TSh 3 million annually.,
4.         Annual benefits attributable to the Project are Kidatu Second Stage
Development's estimated output reduced by losses in the grid (about 15% of
units sent out), valued at present price of T445 per kWh. Sales of Kidatu
Second Stage power would start in 1980 with 80 GWh (average water year), rising
to a maximum of 530 GWh in 1989 and would remain constant thereafter.
5.         The stream of costs and benefits of the project are shown on page 2
of this annex. The rate of return is found to be 23%.
6.         The above computations are based on the growth of sales shown in
Annex 7, which corresponds to about 11% up to 1983 and 10% thereafter. The
rate of return computations have been repeated-for other conditions where the
growth in sales is taken to be 9% throughout the range. Calculations have also
been made for a 33% higher dam cost of hydroelectric development and existing
average tariff level of TV45 per kwIh. From all these'calculations it was
found that the return varies over a range of from 17% to 23%.



ANNEX 14
Page 2 of 4
7.         The costs and benefits streams for the entire Kidatu hydroelectric
development scheme (first and second stages combined) are shown on page 3 of
this Annex. The return is found to be 21%.
8.         Shadow pricing of foreign exchange has also been attempted.  At a
shadow rate of 1.35 (US$1.0 = TSh 11.0), the returns for the Project and for
the entire Kidatu scheme have been found to be 19% and 16% respectively.

Revaluation of Assets
1.        The revaluation of TANESCO's assets has been based on changes in
price levels. Since most price indices are generally not readily available,
it has been agreed that the cost index used for this exercise is the average
of the "Retail Price Index-Wage Earners" and the "Cost of Living Index-Middle
Grade Civil Servants", both of which are published on a current basis by the
Bank of Tanzania in its Quarterly Economic Bulletin, as follows:

.   As of September 1974.
2.        The calculations are shown on page 2 of this Annex.  The revaluation
commenced with the net book values at December 31, 1964 the year in which the
ownership of the assets was transferred to the Government of Tanzania.
3.        As a result of this revaluation, TANESCO's gross fixed assets, as
of December 31, 1974, increased from about TSh 444.8 million to about TSh
732.5 million and, after allowing for revalued accumulated depreciation, the
net operating assets increased from about TSh 260.0 million to about TSh
447.5 million, or by 72%.

TANZANIA ELECTRIC SUPPLY COMPANY LIMITED
Notes and Assumptions on Financial Statements and Projections
Balance Sheets
Revaluation of Assets and Depreziations
1.         TANESCO's gross fixed assets and accumulated depreciation as of
December 31, 1974 have been expressed in 1974 prices, as a result of a reval-
uation summarized in Annex 19. Fixed assets in operation and depreciations
have also been revalued bi-annually from 1974 onward with increases of 20%
in 1975, 18% in 1976, 15% in 1977, and 12Z in 1978, 1979 and 1980. After
1980, assets and depreciations are at 1980 prices. TANESCO's revalued assets
and depreciations are given on page 4 of this Anmex.
Depreciation
2.         Depreciation has been calculated on a straight-line basis.  While
actual annual depreciation rates range from 1% for dams and civil works to
33.5% for certain loose assets, the average depreciation rate has been of the
order of 3.5% per annum. This average rate is expected to decline as a result
of the commissioning of the Kidatu Stage I in 1975 and other projects there-
after, which have substantial civil works contents. An average rate of 2.8%
has been assumed in the financial projections.
Construction Program
3.         The construction program for the years 1975-1982 are given in Annex 5.
Work in Progress
4.         Work in progress has been transferred to assets in operation in the
year of completion.
Inventories
5.         The inventory level of about TSh 47 million is high.  Taking into
account TANESCO's policy of reducing or at least keeping this level in check,
it has been assumed that the inventories would continue to rise by 12% in 1975,
but would remain unchanged in 1976 and 1977. From 1978 onward, inventories
would increase by about 8% per annum.



ANNEX 23
Page 2 of 5
Accounts Receivable
6.         Accounts receivable have been estimated at 18% of annual billings.
Accounts Payable
7.         Accounts payable have been assumed to increase by about 7.5% annually.
Borrowings
8.         Details of annual drawings and debt service for all existing and pro-
posed loans are given on page 5 of this Annex. It has been assumed that the
proposed Third Window loan of US$30 million will be onlent to TANESCO at 8.85%
per annum for a period of 25 years including 5 years of grace and repayable
through equal annual (or semi-annual) level payments of principal and interest
combined, commencing in 1981. It has also been assumed that the Government
will onlend to TANESCO the SIDA grant of SKr 80 million and KfW loan of DM 60
million at similar terms.
Share Capital and Dividends
9.        Shares are issued to the Government in the half-year following the
half year in which government's equity contributions are received. Dividends
are normally paid semi-annually on the basis of the share capital outstanding
at June 30 and December 31 of each year at an annual rate of 6-2/3%. The
Government has accepted that dividends hereafter would be negotiable on the
basis of surpluses generated by TANESCO.  It has been,a8ssumed -inthe_projections
that TANESCO would pay no dividends in 1976, but would declare annual divi-
dends of 6-2/3% in 1977-1979 and 3-1/3% in 1980-1982.
Provision for Deferred Income Taxes
10.       To encourage expansion and development, the Government allows a
liberal tax deduction of 4% of buildings, 12-1/2% on the declining balance of
generating plants and transmission lines, and 25% to 37-1/2% on the declining
balance of trucks and vehicles, in lieu of normal depreciation charges, which
is of the order of 2.8%-3.5% of average gross fixed assets in operation. Pro-
vision has therefore been made for deferred taxes which are potentially payable
at some future time. The present tax rate is 40% on taxable income.
Income Statements
Sales of Energy
11.       Annual unit sales are given in Annex 9.  Tariffs have been assumed
to increase by about 17% effective January 1, 1978; and 16% effective January
1, 1980.
Generation Costs
12.       Breakdowns of generation costs for the years 1975 through 1982 are
as follows:

KIDATU HYDROELECTRIC PROJECT - SECOND STAGE DEVELOPMENT
Project Monitoring
There are a number of areas described in this Annex which are key
factors in the efficient operation of the utility and the success of the Pro-
ject. These have been discussed with the Borrower and the Consultant and
further discussions are to be held to determine firm targets for Section 3.
Main areas for establishing a monitoring system are described below:
1.         Construction of Project
1.1        Performance achievements for construction should be measured monthly
in terms of percentage completion at the end of each month against the target
completion date for each phase of bonus earning construction which would be
shown in the bidding documents for main civil and plant contracts.
1.2        Some important target dates are shown below:
-    Invitation to bid for the main civil
works and permanent equipment                June 30, 1976
-    Tender period                                  June 30 - October 15, 1976
-    Report on tenders                              November 15, 1976
-    Contract Award                                 December 15, 1976
-    Excavation starts                              May 1, 1977
-    Concrete works start                           June 1, 1977
-    Installation of Bottom Gate                    July 1, 1978
-    Erection of Units starts                       May 1, 1978
-    Spillway Gates                                 January 1, 1979
-    Commissioning No. 3 Unit                       March 31, 1980
-    Commissioning No. 4 Unit                       June 30, 1980
2.         Staffing
2.1        Existing staffing level of TANESCO is about 3,000 for total opera-
tions. It is expected that this number should not be exceeded more than 10%
during the next five years. Where staffing levels are excessive, efforts
should be made to reduce staff through limitation on recruitment, early
retirement, etc.



ANNEX 24
Page 2 of 2
3.         Training
3.1        Personnel under training at Kidatu (TANESCO's Kidatu School) and
outside the country should be monitored on an annual basis against the targets
set under the following headings, to meet normal wastage and turnover require-
ments:
(a) Graduate Engineers in University (by classification);
(b) Graduate Engineers on works on field training (by
classification);
(c) Technicians in training (by classification);
(d) Craftsmen in training (by classification);
(e) Others (by number).
4.         Rural Electrification
4.1        Annual records should be maintained, showing against the targets
which have been set:
(a)  Number of townships connected, under KfW, Government
and/or proposed Rural Electrification Corporations
financing respectively;
(b) Number of connections in each area;
