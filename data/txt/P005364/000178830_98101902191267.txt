INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO THE OFFICE NATIONAL DE L'EAU POTABLE (ONEP)
WITH TIlE GUARANTEE OF THE KINGDOM OF MOROCCO
FOR A FIRST WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed loan
to the Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP) with the guarantee of the King-
dom of Morocco for the equivalent of US$48 million to help finance a project
for bulk water supply in the Kenitra-Rabat-Casablanca region of Morocco. The
loan would have a term of twenty-five years, including five years of grace,
with interest at seven and a quarter percent per annum.
PART I - THE ECONOMY
2.        An economic report entitled "Current Economic Position and Pro-
spects of Morocco" (Sec. R 71-222) was distributed on September 20, 1971.
An economic mission visited Morocco in April. Its findings are reflected
in the present Report. The Government has asked the Bank to review the
next five-year Development Plan (1973-77) presently in preparation. The
Bank intends to organize a basic economic mission for this purpose as soon
as the preparation of the new Plan is sufficiently advanced, possibly in
the spring of 1973.
Characteristics
3.        Forming for centuries a well defined geographical unit between the
Mediterranean, the Atlantic, the Atlas mountains and the Sahara, Morocco has
developed a distinctive civilization with a traditional monarchy. Inde-
pendence was achieved in 1956, after 44 years as a French protectorate. The
Government is highly centralized with supreme power held by King Hassan II,
who acceded to the throne in 1961. Arab-Berber cultures are predominant, and
conservative Islamic tradition, in which the King is the religious as well
as the political leader, remains an important unifying force. France left a
deep imprint on culture, business and administration, and French is the pre-
vailing language in government circles, and in education above the primary
level.
4.        In the period since independence the traditional social and polit-
ical order has been essentially maintained while the economic structure began
to change gradually. Traditional subsistence rainfed agriculture still ab-
sorbs more than half of the active population. A small but growing modern



- 2 -
type agriculture provides a substantial part of the commercialized agricul-
tural production. Phosphate mining has remained the major industrial
activity. The relative importance of manufacturing industry is growing
only slowly and is oriented toward import substitution. The traditional
crafts and trades provide substantial employment and supply the Moroccan
population as well as a growing number of tourists. Construction of hotels
and the fast growing tourism traffic have made tourism the most dynamic sec-
tor of the economy. In 1971 foreign exchange earnings from tourism amounted
to $151 million; from phosphate, $117 million; from workers remittances, $95
million; and from citrus exports, $77 million. Major constraints to balanced
economic growth continue to be the vulnerability of agriculture to drought,
low savings, and insufficient dynamism of the private sector, especially in
industry. Unemployment in cities and on the countryside is high and large
differences in cultural and economic level between regions and population
groups exist. Rapid growth of the population aggravates the problems.
Policies
5.        The objectives pursued by successive governments since independence
include: (i) acceleration of economic growth; (ii) preservation of social and
political stability; and (iii) promotion of "Moroccanization", i.e. a larger
share for Moroccan ownership and management in foreign-owned land, commer-
cial and financial companies, and selected industries.
6.        The moroccanization policy has been consistent but moderate.    For-
eign businesses have not been nationalized with the exception of the take-over
in 1963 of land held under concession by foreign owners. The number of for-
eigners declined from 400,000 in 1960 to 100,000 in 1971. "Moroccanization"
of the services sector implies the gradual increase of the share of Moroccan
capital and labor in foreign-owned commercial, financial and transport con-
cerns, often associated with an expansion of capital. At the same time new
foreign investment in industry, tourism and mining continues to be encouraged
by the Government. Other recent economic measures include: tariff cuts and
trade liberalization on the occasion of Morocco's association with the Common
Market, slight increases in long term interest rates applied by certain fi-
nancial institutions to reflect better the opportunity cost of capital, and
increase in tariffs for water supply helping to increase public savings in
that sector.
7.        The political and social structures have been resistant to change,
but the Government recognizes that their stability is increasingly in question
unless growth and change are achieved at a more rapid pace, and are accom-
panied by a more equal income distribution. In recent speeches, the King has
stressed several social-economic objectives, in particular redistribution of
income, creation of jobs, land distribution, extension of education and reform
of administration and justice. A new constitution has been enacted and a Gov-
ernment formed to prepare elections which would provide a wider basis for the
next administration. The Government has increased civil servants basic
salaries and workers minimum wages by 15 percent, extended family allowances,
introduced a modest progressive income tax and reduced the price Oof sugar, an



-3-
important consumption item of the low income classes. It intends to accel-
erate the distribution of ex-colon land, to extend pension and health insurance
schemes, to embark on a wide-scale replacement of slum areas, and to help set
up small farms.
Development Plan
8.        The 1968-72 Development Plan is nearing completion and a new five-
year Plan (1973-1977) is under preparation. During the present Plan period
the production growth in most sectors has surpassed the Plan targets substan-
tially:
(percent average annual growth)
Actual    Plan
1968-71 Targets
Agriculture                           6.4      2.1
Energy                                7.2      5.4
Mining                                2.1      7.9
Industry and Handicraft               5.7      4.3
Building and public works             5.9      8.5
Non-government services               5.4      4.6
Total (government services excluded) 5.6       4.3
9.        Results in agriculture appear better than they really were because
of a mediocre crop in the base year.   But even taking more normal periods as
a base, the average growth of agricultural output has been about 3.5 percent,
well above expectations. Only mining fell below the Plan target, largely
because competition on the world phosphate market depressed production, and
1971 output was only three quarters of the volume planned. Prospects have
recently improved and the Government phosphate company expects to reach the
plan target in 1973. Most other mining declined due to depletion of re-
socurces. The political events of mid-summer 1971 had limited immediate ef-
fect on the overall growth rate. The acceleration in manufacturing output
and construction activity was interrupted, but good weather helped to in-
crease agricultural output. Total production increased by 5 percent in real
terms, only slightly lower than that of the preceding three years.
10.       The volume of total fixed investment increased by 6 percent annual-
ly during the 1968-71 period, slightly lower than was assumed in the Plan.
Central Government investments accounted for about half of the total and was
close to the targets which were revised upward in 1969. About 70 percent of
the Government investment program in agriculture was allocated to large scale
irrigation schemes. While dam construction proceeded on schedule, land
preparation lagged behind and progress with regard to rainfed agriculture and
livestock was slow. Construction of power stations is in line with Plan tar-
gets. Other government investments did not differ by more than 10 percent
from Plan targets except for delays in investments for urban development,
health, education and communications.



-4-
11.       Since the abortive coup of July 1971, many private investors seem
to be awaiting the outcome of the political reorganization which is under
way, and public investments have also been stagnant largely due to some re-
consideration of policies and changes in cabinet and civil service. Total
fixed capital formation in 1971 dropped by about 2 percent in real terms and
represented 14.1 percent of GDP. Consumer demand was sustained by good crops
and the social measures taken by the Government since mid-1971. The impact
of these measures on government savings was offset by better performance of
public enterpirses, while the good crops and remittances from emigrant workers
stimulated private savings. However, total gross national savings remain
around 12 percent of GDP, which is low for a country at Morocco's stage of
development. The current account deficit was reduced from $144 million to
$78 million, and thanks to larger public capital inflow and S.DR allocation,
the reserve position improved and reached a level of $235 million in March
1972, equivalent to about two and a half months of imports off goods.
Development Prospects
12.       Appropriate fiscal, monetary and trade policies cou'ld ensure that
GDP will continue to grow at about 5 percent per year until T977. However,
to achieve this modest target, per capita annual consumption. would have to
be limited to 1.5 percent. This would not be easy in view of the increased
attention given by the Government to social progress, but would be necessary
because a growth rate of 5 percent would require savings and investments to
be raised from about 12 percent and 14 percent of GDP respectively to 14 per-
cent and 17 percent of GDP in 1977. The other growth assumptions could prob-
ably be achieved without major difficulty. On the basis of present trends,
foreign aid disbursements in 1977 might be projected as follows, although the
actual flows will depend on future commitments still to be made by the respec-
tive donors:
(million of dollars)
Annual Average      Actual     Projection
1966/68 1969/71      1971         1977
Bilateral                             112     125        144          156
USA                                  (48)     (56)       (56)         (36)
France                               (39)     (27)       (30)         (54)
Germany                              (19)     (17)       (28)         (17)

-5-
13.       While the above projections appear feasible, the Government's tar-
gets are likely to be more ambitious. It is considering an annual growth
target of 6.5 percent for the next Five-Year Plan, and is working out its
implications. These would clearly include stronger growth of gross national
savings and additional foreign aid. If more aid could be obtained, it would
be desirable for it to be on concessionary terms, since the terms of aid
which is already in prospect are likely to deteriorate as a result of the
decline in grants, especially from the United States, and of the increase in
medium-term credits which would be the normal form of part of the projected
larger French aid.
External Debt
14.       Disbursed foreign debt is at present $804 million and may grow to
about $1,500 million in 1977. The debt service ratio may rise from 8.9 per-
cent in 1971 to 12 percent in 1977 and further thereafter. While Morocco
remains creditworthy for substantial additional loans on conventional terms,
a substantial proportion of new external assistance should be made available
on concessional terms if the growth of the debt service burden is to be re-
strained in the long run. The share of the Bank Group in Morocco's total
outstanding external debt is increasing. From about 7 percent at the end of
1968 it had reached 10 percent at the end of 1971 and may rise to 20 percent
by the end of 1975. Projects already approved and those under consideration
would lead to disbursements equivalent to about one-fifth of Morocco's pro-
jected foreign capital needs in the mid-seventies.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN MRORCCO
15.       Bank and IDA lending since the first Bank group project in 1962
amounts to $211.4 million, net of cancellations, for 12 projects, three of
which were financed under IDA credits totalling $28.4 million. These loans
have helped finance industry ($85 million), agriculture ($71.1 million),
transportation ($14.6 million), education ($10.5 million), and tourism ($17
million). Two further operations have been submitted to the Executive Direc-
tors for consideration on June 29. They are a proposed loan of $15 million
to the Credit Immobilier et Hotelier (CIH) for hotel financing and a proposed
development credit of $10 million to Morocco together with a proposed loan of
$24 million to the Caisse Nationale de Credit Agricole (CNCA) for an agricul-
tural credit project. IFC has made investments totalling $2.4 million in the
Banque Nationale pour le Developpement Economique (BNDE) and a canning factory.
Annex I contains a summary statement of Bank loans, IDA credits and IFC in-
vestments as of May 31, 1972 and notes on the execution of on-going proj-
ects with particular reference to those which are encountering problems.
16.       The Bank group strategy is to respond to the requirements of
Morocco's economic and social objectives, which appear in line with most
previous Bank recommendations. Specifically the Bank group program aims at
assisting Morocco in maintaining a growth of GDP at roughly 5 percent per



-6-
year, the rate achieved in the recent past, financing key projects in prior-
ity sectors, and devising and implementing policies to limit unemployment,
develop agriculture and improve urban and rural living conditions. It con-
templates primarily lending from the Bank, but with some blending of IDA
funds, as in the present case, in order to moderate the build up of external
debt service requirements. In the last three years Bank and IDA lending
ranged between $45 and $75 million. Projects now in course of preparation
could lead to a higher level of lending over the next two or three years, but
this muclh depends upon Morocco's capacity to prepare projects, upon solving
the difficulties encountered in creating new institutions or in improving ex-
isting ones and upon finding competent management.
Sectors and Projects
17.       The key sectors on which the Bank concentrates its action are agri-
culture, tourism, urban infrastructure, industry for export and transport.
Amongst these key sectors, agriculture and urban infrastructure provide spe-
cial opportunities to help devise and implement policies responding to the
Government's new emphasis on social development.
18.       In agriculture the proposed $34 million second financing for agri-
cultural credit would help develop modern farming. The problems of tradi-
tional agriculture would be dealt with through a project for the integrated
development of rainfed agriculture now being prepared with the help of
the FAO/IBRD Cooperative Program; this project would combine consolidation,
basic infrastructure, soil preparation and credit, and could have a substan-
tial effect on rural underemployment. It may be ready for consideration by
FY 1974. A study of the Oum er Rbia basin development was recently com-
pleted in cooperation with the Bank, and an irrigation scheme is now under
preparation. Originally planned for financing in FY 1972, it has been post-
poned to FY 1974 because of delays in initiating the feasibility studies.
The Bank is also helping the Government define and prepare a project to de-
velop the production of off-season fruits and vegetables for export.
19.       Tourism has become the largest source of foreign exchange for
Morocco and its further expansion should help finance the substantial imports
necessary for future development. The Bank finances the Moroccan development
bank for hotels (CIII) for which a second loan of $15 million was recently
presented to the Executive Directors. The Bank might also well be Executing
Agency for a proposed UNDP study which could lead to a tourism infrastructure
project for FY 1974. Finally the Bank is helping the Government to coordinate
a number of other studies and reviews of the sector.
20.       Urban infrastructure projects include the present first water supply
project, to be followed by a second one in FY 1974. A Bank sector mission has
recently reviewed the Government's proposed urbanization policies and identi-
fied a site and service project which may be ready for financing in FY 1974.
Finally, a power project planned for FY 1973 is designed to meet urban needs.



-7-
21.       The Government is now placing more emphasis on exports.    The Bank
has assisted this orientation through an industrial review completed 18
months ago and is now helping define the required policies and the measures
to implement them, particularly in manufacturing and mining. In this line,
the Bank is considering two proposed loans for FY 1973, i.e. a sixth loan to
the industrial development bank (BNDE) and a loan for a phosphoric acid plant
whose production would be entirely exported.
22.       Morocco's transport network requires some expansion to meet grow-
ing needs. After a first loan to finance the road between Marrakesh and
Agadir and a transport survey, a transport sector mission visited the country
in late 1971. A second road project is now under preparation for presentation
in FY 1973. A port expansion project may also be ready for FY 1974.
23.       Education represents a major bottleneck in Morocco's development:
students represent a low proportion of the school age population, the pro-
portion of drop-outs is high, curricula are not well adapted to economic de-
velopment, graduates arc too frequently unable to use the skills acquired
and, as a result, unrest in the student population is high, leading to
strikes and a further lowering of the standard of education. If this dete-
rioration is allowed to continue social stability could be affected while
the qualified personnel needed to insure economic expansion would be lacking.
Projects for education in Morocco undoubtedly have a high priority; two cred-
its already have been made and another is planned for FY 1974. However, its
presentation will depend on a substantial improvement in the execution of the
first two projects and on the completion of the study of higher education
whose financing is included in the second credit (Annex I C. para. 1).
Other Assistance
24.       A Consultative Group for Morocco was formed in April 1967.    The
Group is chaired by the Bank and includes Belgium, Canada, France, Germany,
Italy, Kuwait, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United
States, IMF, UNDP, OECD/DAC, African Development Bank and European Invest-
ment Bank. At its last meeting, in October 1971, the Group welcomed Gov-
ernment's new policies and affirmed continued support.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY SECTOR
CharacterLstics
25.       In most of Morocco water is scarce, the summers are hot and dry, and
rainfall is concentrated in the few winter months. Available water sources
renewed each year amount to some 25,000 million m3 and under present techniques,
about 16,000 million m3 are usable of which half is actually consumed. Water
rights are frequently more important than ownership of land as a source of
political and economic power. Works to control and store water date back to
the very origins of Morocco and are more essential today than ever.



- 8-
26.       Morocco's population is about 15 million, of which about two-thirds
live in rural areas; the urban population is heavily concentrated in six
cities, Casablanca, Rabat-Sale, Marrakesh, Fes, Meknes and Tangier, which have
altogether a population of about 3 million. Total population growth rate is
estimated to be 2.6 annually. Urban growth rate, including migration from
rural areas, is estimated to be 5 percent. Overcrowding in the ancient parts
of the cities (medinas) and in the more recent shanty towns (bidonvilles) at
the outskirts of cities is becoming very serious. A few cases of cholera last
summer underlined the danger of inadequate water supply and sewerage systems.
27.       Some urban or village water supply systems date back to the Middle
Ages. The medina of Fes in particular, the ancient imperial capital, still
enjoys water and sewerage systems in earthenware pipes which were started
in the 11th century. During the French protectorate these ancient systems
were progressively replaced by modern installations. Today Morocco has some
125 piped water supply systems to which most urban middle class and lower
middle class housing is connected. Parts of the medinas and' shanty towns
have to rely on public pumps sometimes located at great distance. In vil-
lages, water is still often provided through ancient wells,. sometimes modern-
ized with pumps. In the last decade, investment in additional production and
distribution capacity has been insufficient and, except in the large urban
centers, maintenance has been poor. Backlogs in water supply exist through-
out the country, but there is little knowledge about the extent of the prob-
lem. As a rough estimate, present supply might account for 70-80 percent of
demand in the Rabat-Casablanca zone and for some 60 percent in the interior.
Organized sewerage systems exist only in the large cities, but are generally
inadequate. Morocco has no major sewerage treatment facilities.
Studies
28.       In 1967 the Government requested the UNDP to finance an urban water
supply master plan up to the year 2000 and feasibility studies for the first
stage of the plan in the coastal zone between Casablanca and Kenitra. The
UNDP agreed to this request in January 1968. The World Health Organization
(WHO) is the executing agency. The provisional results of the feasibility
studies by consultants for the first stage were used by the appraisal mission
for the proposed project and the final results were reviewed before completing
appraisal. A second stage of the study should be completed by the end of
1972. These studies are expected to lead to a series of projects to help
eliminate the present backlog in demand for potable water. Several of these
projects may be presented for Bank financing.
29.       In the project area, the Atlantic coastal zone, the possibilities of
further exploiting ground water sources have been almost exhausted.. 'Accord-'
ingly, the master plan for the Atlantic coastal zone envisages_the use of the-
three major rivers in this area, Bou Regreg, Oum er Rbia and Sebou.   Of these
rivers, the Bou Regreg flows only through rough and semi-mountainous territory
with little potential for irrigated farming. Conversely, the Oum er Rbia and
the Sebou flow through plains which are becoming Morocco's major irrigated
farming areas. In the search for a satisfactory technical solution, some



-9-
20 alternatives were considered and eventually reduced to two: (a) construc-
tion of a large dam on the Bou Regreg river and a pipeline to Casablanca; or
(b) construction of a smaller dam at the same Bite feeding into an existing
pipeline, with Casablanca's immediate needs being met by expanding transmis-
sion facilities from the Oum er Rbia. The Bank initially favored the second
alternative which was marginally lower in estimated cost, but the Government
strongly favored the first solution, which would not draw on water which
could be used for irrigation. The Bank agreed in April, 1971, to accept the
flrst scheme, which the Government favored and which forms the basis for the
proposed project.
30.       The preparation of the proposed project illustrates the conflicts
between water uses that are likely to become ever more critical in Morocco,
not only between the holders of traditional water rights, but also between
various sectors of the economy. These problems are further complicated by
the variety of criteria which must be considered in trying to resolve such
conflicts: e.g. life and health, economic return, income distribution,
respect of ancient rights. The 8,000 million m3 presently consumed annually
have frequently been allocated on the basis of ill-defined political and
social considerations which have resulted in 7,500 million m3 for agricul-
ture, 300 million m3 for human consumption and 200 million m3 for industrial
use. With growing needs, it has become clear that more rational methods of
allocation are needed to ensure the orderly development of the country.
Several partial studies were undertaken in the past. The Bank has proposed
and the Government has agreed to have an overall study undertaken for the
establishment of a Water Master Plan identifying all known water resources
in the country and suggesting criteria and priorities to allocate them to
the various sectors of the Moroccan economy. Simultaneously a team of
Moroccans would be trained and would subsequently police the execution of
the Master Plan, continue to search for and identify new water resources,
evaluate new water needs and periodically update the Master Plan as required.
Organization and Administration
31.       The structure of the water supply sector is complex due to the mul-
tiplicity of authorities involved.   The largest organization has hitherto
been the Regle des Exploitations Industrielles (REI) a government agency which
supplied water for a great number of centers but which also had other functions
such as operating the government motor pool. REI was governed by a Board of
Management comprising the Minister of Public Works as Chairman and three re-
presentatives of other Ministries. Its general manager was closely supervised
by the Ministries of Finanices and Public Works. REI personnel were largely
governed by civil service regulations. This system was not conducive to ef-
ficient management.
32.       The second most important production and transmission agency is
the French controlled private concessionnaire which supplies Casablanca.
Distribution of water is the responsibility mainly of autonomous municipal
agencies (Regies) in large cities and elsewhere of municipal or provincial
administrations. Sewerage systems, where they exist, are also administered



- 10 -
directly by the municipalities. The Ministry of Interior supervises the
provinces and municipalities and, through them, the Regies, and has to ap-
prove the tariffs they propose. In the rural areas it shares responsibility
with the Ministry of Agriculture. The Regies, as well as REI, managed their
operations more efficiently than the provincial and municipal administration,
although the Regies are facing increasing financial problems because their
tariffs have not been adjusted since 1959. The policies of the various Min-
istries and authorities involved have not always been coordinated, leading
to inefficiencies and disputes on alternative courses of action.
33.       During project preparation and loan negotiations the organization
of the sector was substantially improved. The Prime Minister's Office as-
sumed overall coordinating responsibility, and a new national water supply
organization, Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP) was created. ONEP has
taken over all REI's functions but will abandon as soon as feasible those
which are not related to water. Its responsibilities as a bulk water sup-
plier are progressively being extended over the whole country. ONEP's Board
is chaired, like that of REI, by the Minister of Public Works, and comprises
twenty members representing interested Ministries, provincial assemblies and
some Regies. ONEP's financial autonomy has been established through a 15
percent raise in the bulk water tariff in the coastal zone, a tariff covenant
(para. 41) and new regulations soon to be issued by the Minister of Finance,
which would allow ONEP more freedom in its financial management while retain-
ing appropriate controls against possible abuses. The Ministry of Public
Works is expected to limit its control over ONEP to broad policy issues.
New personnel regulations will enable ONEP to recruit and retain qualified
personnel. Management consultants financed under the proposed loan would
help define and implement an efficient organization for ONEP.
34.       The increase in ONEP's bulk tariffs should eventually be reflected
in the retail tariff of the Regies, but the information presently available
is insufficient to determine the extent of the raises needed. The Government
has therefore agreed to have a nationwide retail rate study carried out by
consultants. The study for the coastal zone will be completed by June 30,
1973 and for the rest of the country by December 31, 1973. The Government
will then consider all measures necessary to ensure that retail tariffs are
reviewed and adjusted as necessary to reflect the full cost of production
and distribution and to allow the Regies to finance a reasonable part of
their future investments.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
35.       Bank staff carried out a first identification mission in September
1968, and have since then closely followed the preparation of the master plan
for urban water supply and the Project. In April 1971 a Bank mission includ-
ing experts in hydrology and the design of dams reviewed the WHO/UNDP feas-
ibility study on the first stage of the Project. An appraisal mission visited
Rabat in September and October 1971.--*Negotiations' took place in Washington
from May 9 to June 7, 1972. The Moroccan delegation was headed by Mr. N. El
Ghorfi, Director for Economic Cooperation, Prime Minister's Office.



36.       The Project is the first stage of the implementation of the water
supply master plan. It provides for bulk water production in the Atlantic
Coastal Zone between Casablanca and Kenitra. It should satisfy the demand
of the urban population in that area for the next ten years (2.3 million of
people in 1970 rising to 3.7 million in 1980 which would then account for
close to 20 percent of Morocco's total population). The project's main
elements are the Bou Regreg dam, where the transmission system originates,
90 km of transmission lines to Casablanca a water treatment plant and a pump-
ing station. The Project also includes the rehabilitation of the Fouarat
system, which consists of the Mamora wellfield near Kenitra; a 136 km pipe-
line to Casablanca via Rabat, and the Oued Mellah treatment plant near
Mohammedia. A Loan and Project Summary is given in Annex III. A report
entitled "Appraisal of the First Water Supply Project, Morocco, Casablanca-
Rabat Water Supply" (No. PU-96) of June 15, 1972 is being circulated separate-
ly to the Executive Directors.
Project Execution
37.       To prevent a potential water shortage in Rabat in 1974 and in
Casablanca in 1975, the Government began construction of the dam in May,
1971. Construction is scheduled so that filling of the reservoir can
start in the Fall of 1973, with the first heavy rainfall which normally
occurs in November. The pipeline to Casablanca would be constructed in
two phases: the first section terminating at Bouznika (40 kmn) to be com-
pleted in 1975, and the second from Bouznika to Casablanca (44 km) in 1976.
This phasing would permit an increased supply to Casablanca from 1975,
through the rehabilitated Fouarat pipeline from Bouznika to Casablanca.
38.       Responsibility for project implementation would be shared by ONEP
and the Hydraulics Department. In conformity with Moroccan practice, owner-
ship of the dam will remain with the Government, but control, operation and
maintenance will be vested in ONEP. Supervision of construction of the dam,
of the intake tower and the tunnel is the responsibility of the Hydraulics
Department, with minor assistance from consultants. A similar arrangement
is functioning satisfactorily for supervision of the construction of the
Bank-financed Idriss I dam (Loan 643-MOR). For supervision of construction
of the pumping station, treatment plant and pipelines, ONEP will retain
consultants who would also train ONEP staff and gradually transfer part of
the supervisory work to these employees.
39.       The total Project cost is estimated at USS104.9 million with a
foreign exchange component of US$50.4 million including US$2.3 million fi-
nanced bilaterally. The cost of the various elements is summarized in Annex
III, page 1. Physical contingencies range from 10 percent for the dam and
the pipeline to 30 percent for reconditioning of the Fouarat Scheme. Price
contigencies are based on the expectation of average annual increases of
3 percent and 5 percent in local and foreign costs respectively, continuing
the trend of recent years. The foreign cost components of the various
civil works are estimated to range between 36 percent and 64 percent, which



- 12 -
takes into account that Morocco is a net importer of fuel, cement and steel.
Taxes, totalling approximately DiH 73 million (US$15.7 million) are included
in the cost estimates because the Government does not intend to give tax
exemptions for the Project.
Financing Plan
40.       Total Project costs amount to $104.9 million, including the equiv-
alent of $15.7 million for taxes. The proposed Bank loan of $48 million
would finance 45.8 percent of total costs; bilateral aid from France and the
United States has financed $2.3 million equivalent or 2.2 percent of total
costs. The Government's contribution of $40.8 million equivalent will amount
to 38.9 percent of total costs, while ONEP's internal cash generation will
provide the equivalent of $13.8 million or 13.1 percent of the total cost of
the Project. If production taxes and customs duties paid by ONEP during the
construction period are taken into account, the Government's net contribution
to the Project would be about $25.1 million. The cost of the Project repre-
sents about 65 percent of ONEP's estimated total capital requirements during
the construction period, 1971-77.
Financial Situation
41.       In 1968-70, water activities showed a steadily declining operating
surplus. During the same period, fixed assets were provided almost wholly
by government grants and consumers' contributions; ONEP will not take over
any debt.  The Government and ONEP have agreed that ONEP should achieve a
rate of return of not less than 1 percent until 1976, 2 percent for the
period 1977-80, and 7 percent thereafter, thus allowing ONEP to make increas-
ing contributions towards the cost of its future expansion. On this basis,
the operating ratio is expected to fall from about 100 percent at present to
about 64 percent in 1985. ONEP has also agreed that, unless the Bank other-
wise agrees, it will incur no debt before 1977 and that after that year, net
revenues at the time of incurrence should, before depreciation and interest,
amount to at least 1.5 times the maximum future debt service.
Procurement
42.       All equipment supply and civil works contracts to be financed from
the proposed loan have been or will be awarded on the basis of international
competitive bidding. The equipment and material required for this project,
except for some minor items, are not produced in Morocco. As a result of
the Act of Algeciras in 1906, Morocco has no preferential tariffs despite
its association with the European Economic Community. As noted in paragraph
37, advance contracting of some US$35 million was necessary because of the
lead time needed to build the dam to meet water shortages expected in 1974.
The main contacts have been awarded, with the approval of the Bank, to Dumez
(France) for the dam, B.V.S. (France) and Waagner-Biro (Austria) for hydro-
mechanical equipment (dam and intake) and Klein-Schanzlin and Becker (Germany)
for pumps.



- 13 -
Disbursement
43.       Disbursements on the proposed loan would be for the C.I.F. price of
imported equipment, and for percentages representing the estimated foreign
exchange component of civil works contracts, locally procured equipment and
consultants' services. Estimated disbursements are shown in Annex III. Re-
troactive financing of about US$4 million is proposed for expenditures in-
curred for the dam after May 1, 1971.
Jus tl lfic aion
44.       The Government has no option but to proceed with this large
investment if it wishes to avoid serious water shortages and consequen-
tial health hazards in the coastal zone within the next few years. With
present retail water tariffs in Casablanca and Rabat (approximating
DH 0.70/M3), unchanged for over 10 years, the projected incremental
revenues from water sales provide no measure of the importance to Morocco
of avoiding these shortages. Yet even at these tariffs, which are so low
as to cause serious financial problems for the distribution agencies and
which will have to be raised in due course in the light of the study re-
ferred to in paragraph 34 above, the rate of discount which equalizes the
streams of revenues and costs attributable to the project would approximate
6%.
PART V. -- LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHOPITY
45.       The draft Loan Agreement between the Bank and Office National de
l'Eau Potable (ONEP), the draft Guarantee Agreement between the Kingdom of
Morocco and the Bank, the Report of the Committee provided for in Article III,
Section 4 (iii) of the Articles of Agreement and the text of a resolution
approving the proposed loan are being distributed to the Executive Directors
separately.
46.       The Loan Agreement is subject to the following conditions of
effectiveness:
(a) the enactmtent of personnel regulations, enabling ONEP to
recruit and retain qualified personnel;
(b) the promulgation of financial control regulations
ensuring the requisite financial autonomy of ONEP.
47.       The draft agreements conform to the normal pattern for loans for
watcr supply projects.
48.       I an satisfied that the proposed loan would comply with the
Articles of Agreement of the Banlk.

C.    Projects in Execution
1.    Delays in disbursements of several loans and credits have been
caused mainly by cumbersome budgetary and accounting procedures, and
administrative inefficiency in submitting disbursement applications,
rather than by delays in the execution of the project. A Bank disburse-
ment officer visited Morocco last November to investigate the problems
and propose solutions. During the recent negotiations further improve-
ments and streamlining of procedure were agreed upon.
2.    Considerable delays have been, and still are, affecting the
execution of the education credits (79 and 266-MOR). Disbursements
under the first credit have been extremely slow and the Closing date
had to be extended twice, from the original date of June 30, 1971 to
March 31, 1973; disbursements under the second credit have not yet
started, ten months after signing.  Project implementation has been
affected by inadequate management of the project unit, insufficient
control of construction works, departures from agreed procedures for
procurement, and lack of coordination. The higher education study
needed to prepare a proposed third loan is not yet started. Despite
numerous supervision missions, little progress has so far been achieved.
This situation is under constant review and a number of specific steps
for project implementation has just been suggested to the Government.
3.    The Sebou irrigation loan (643-MOR) is progressing satisfactorily.
Redistribution of expropriated properties to small landowners started more
slowly than expected because of delays in enacting the necessary legis-
lation. Substantial cost increases on a number of important items are
becoming apparent and as soon as they are reviewed, the Bank will discuss
with the Government their consequence for the financing of the project.
4.    The first highway financing (167 and 642-MOR), mainly for the
Agadir-Marrakesh road, is progressing satisfactorily from a technical
standpoint. However, only $2.7 million has yet been withdrawn out of
a combined loan/credit amounting to $14.6 million.  The Effective date
was March 16, 1970, and the Closing date is February 28, 1974. The
situation is being reviewed with the Government.
