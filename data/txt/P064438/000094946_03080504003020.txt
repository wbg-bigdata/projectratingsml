EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
INTRODUCTION
The South African National Parks (SANParks) accepted the challenge of a proposal
put forward by Kerley & Boshoff (1997) to expand the Addo Elephant National Park
to encapsulate the unique assemblage of biodiversity and tourism opportunities in
the area, as well as to amalgamate the Woody Cape and Tootabie Nature Reserves
to form a core conservation area of global significance.
Specialist studies were commissioned in 2001 with the financial support of the
Global Environment Facility (GEF) (in the form of a PDF Block B grant), administered
through the World Bank. The specialist studies focused on the scientific and socio-
economic analyses that would underpin the implementation of a greater Addo
Elephant National Park (gAENP) Conservation Project.
The Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), commissioned as one of the
specialist studies of the gAENP project, was to consolidate the biophysical and
socio-economic information in a rational and logical manner to facilitate strategic
planning and decision making around the project. Specific aims included:
1.   The synthesis of all existing information (biophysical, socio-economic and
institutional).
2.    Description of the gAENP initiative.
3.    Discussion of the opportunities and constraints presented by the
environment for the gAENP programme.
4.    Description of the socio-economic and biophysical implications of
establishing the gAENP.
5.   Identification of options for an acceptable way forward.
6.   The presentation of this information in an acceptable format to the public,
authorities and other Interested and Affected Parties (I&APS).
7.   The SEA must meet World Bank Safeguard requirements. Three of the
Bank's safeguard operational policies are triggered in this SEA i.e. OP
4.11 (Cultural Property); OP 4.12 (Involuntary Resettlement) and OP 4.01
(Environmental Assessment).
THE GREATER ADDO ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK PROPOSAL
The Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) was proclaimed in 1931 with the express
purpose of protecting the last remaining Eastern Cape elephants. Unbeknown at the
time, its locality could not have been more fortunate as it was set in possibly the
country's most biologically diverse area - an opportunity now attempting to be
consolidated.
The proposed gAENP will include a unique combination of land and seascapes,
biodiversity and socio-economic opportunities. Spanning almost 200km in length,
and about 30km wide, and covering about 440 000ha, inclusive of 100 000ha marine
area, would make it the third largest national park in South Africa. The creation of a
conservation area of this magnitude would certainly enhance the conservation of
poorly represented biodiversity in the region.
As the development and expansion of the park remains a dynamic process,
incorporating many factors besides direct purchase such as contractual inclusions,

delineation of its exact boundaries would remain uncertain. However, for the purpose
of this study, the 340 000ha terrestrial footprint initially proposed by Kerley and
Boshoff (1997), with a 5km buffer area (needed to facilitate information gathering on
the border areas), and a marine area inclusive of the Bird and St Croix island groups
was used. This total area is referred to as the planning domain.
Expansion of the park would capture important biological patterns and allow the re-
establishment of ecological processes  essential for ensuring  ecological
sustainability. It would increase the country's terrestrial conservation area from 5.5%
to 5.7%, as well as considerably increasing the country's few marine protected
areas. Given the parks unique assemblage of biodiversity (representation of five of
the country's seven biomes), and linkage with a marine protected area (MPA), the
park would make a major contribution to South Africa's commitment to the
international Conventions on Biological Diversity and Combating Desertification.
The proposed gAENP will be able to support almost all eco-tourism experiences
sought after by tourists - local and international - therefore fulfilling the aim of
enhancing the socio-economic benefits of the region. This will not only allow the park
to generate income, but will have major economic spin-offs for local communities,
the Eastern Cape and South Africa, as more international revenue is injected into the
country, creating more employment and wealth. In addition, the park will support
basic and essential life-supporting ecological services, a facet that is difficult to
measure, and not often factored into analyses.
The gAENP proposal is supported by national Government and the public, and has
received financial support from a number of international and national sources (e.g.
GEF, Humane Society of United States, IFAW, Department of Environmental Affairs
and Tourism (DEAT), Working for Water and Poverty Relief).
THE GREATER ADDO ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK STRATEGIC
ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT (SEA)
The goals of the SEA for the gAENP are to synthesise existing socio-economic and
biophysical information, to determine opportunities and constraints presented by the
environment for the gAENP programme, to recommend ways to optimise
opportunities and minimise constraints, and to distribute this information to I&APs.
Another goal of the SEA is to highlight World Bank Safeguard Policies. Some of
these policies have been triggered in this study and have required investigation to
avoid, minimise and/or mitigate impacts.
Stakeholders and other Interested and Affected Parties (I&APs) have been
encouraged to become involved in the process from an early stage, to ensure that a
transparent planning process is achieved.
Although only one overriding land use option has been considered namely
conservation, various options regarding  boundaries and  institutional and
management strategies have been considered.
The gAENP SEA process has involved interactions with specialists, the client,
authorities, the World Bank and the public. The SEA and specialist studies have

Coastal & Environmental Services
identified a number of information gaps, which will be dealt with during the course of
implementation of the gAENP, depending upon their importance.
THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
Biodiversity
As the central caveat of the gAENP remains the conservation of biodiversity of the
region in perpetuity, biodiversity priority areas were determined using a strategic and
dynamic GIS conservation-planning tool, called C-Plan (2001). C-Plan is used to
identify conservation priority areas in a systematic and defensible manner based
upon best available information. Priority areas would entail those areas that would
ensure biodiversity pattern, as well as the natural processes that support and drive it.
It is important to note that the C-Plan analysis indicates which areas are important,
but does not make recommendations as to which management models may be
appropriate for implementation.
Terrestrial environment
Biodiversity of the terrestrial environment was determined by mapping the 43
identified land classes/vegetation types scattered amongst the five biomes occurring
in the planning domain. The terrestrial environment is diverse and consists of the
Algoa dunefield in the southeast, adjacent the Alexandria coastal forest block.
Moving northwards from the coast towards the Zuurberg Mountain range, a variety of
mesic thicket types occur, and two intrusions of mesic thicket into the Indian Ocean
forest reach almost to the coast. Fynbos/grassland mosaics occur on the Zuurberg in
the central area. Nama Karoo intrusions occur in the north and west of the planning
domain. The east-west aligned Zuurberg range dominates the central part of the
area. The Alexandria forest receives the highest rainfall in the planning domain and
the areas north and west of the Zuurberg the least.
The faunal species composition is well represented in the planning domain, with the
notable exception of a number of the large predators such as lions, cheetah and wild
dogs. The most conspicuous and well-known is the Addo elephant (Loxondonta
africana). The elephants are of a high conservation status and are considered to be
keystone species in subtropical Thicket. The endangered black rhinoceros (Diceros
bicomis bicomis) occur and are also an important tourist attraction. The proposed
park will also be important for the conservation of a broad suite of conservation
worthy species, many of which have Red Data Book status but are overlooked purely
because they lack charismatic appeal. These include the endemic dune grasshopper
Acrtylos hirsutus and hairy-footed gerbil (Gerbillurus paeba) exilis, which occur in the
Alexandria dunefield, the important flightless dung beetle (Circellum bacchus) and
the butterfly (Aloeides clarki).
However, exotic indigenous species such as impala, lechwe and blesbok, introduced
onto private land occur within the area and could become potential problems.
Freshwater environment
The Sundays River and its tributaries form the most significant river system that
flows though the gAENP. The Sundays River, which is of great value for irrigation in
the lower Sundays Valley, extends well beyond the boundaries of the proposed park,
but significant tributaries or at least their headwaters occur within the proposed park.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                vii



Coastal & Environmental Services
These include the Coerney, Krom, Wit, Kabougaand the Klein Uie rivers. Other
important river systems that flow within the planning domain are the upper
Bushmans River with its tributaries, the Blou and Steins rivers (northeast), and the
Boknes River and its tributaries (southeast). The Sundays and Boknes rivers are. the
only rivers within the planning domain that flow into the sea.
The Darlington Dam (previously Lake Mentz) is a large (4 350 ha) impoundment
within the proposed park that receives Orange River water through interbasin
transfer. The Sundays River Irrigation Board manages the water release programme.
Entire river drainage systems or catchments are recognised as ideal conservation
units, as they comprise discrete ecosystems and allow management of most
associated ecological processes.
Nine different types of waterbodies occur in the gAENP, each having a complement
of biotopes with characteristic flora and fauna, that collectively add to the broad
diversity of the park. The freshwater ecosystems include: perennial rivers; seasonal
rivers; episodic rivers; ephemeral rivers; permanent and semi-permanent vleis;
seasonal vleis: springs and seeps; episodic endorheic pans; forest swamps and
marshes. A number of threatened faunal species rely on these waterbodies for their
survival.
Marine environment
Algoa Bay is recognised as being part of the South Coast marine biogeographical
province (equivalent to the terrestrial biomes of South Africa). The potential to create
a Marine Protected Area (MPA) along this stretch of the coast and to link up with the
two offshore island groups and the terrestrial component of the park is of national
and international significance.
Algoa Bay is at the extreme east of the Agulhas Bank and the fish fauna is made up
of species found on both the east and (to a lesser extent) west coasts of South Africa
and many are endemic to South Africa.
The marine mammal fauna of South Africa comprises in excess of 30 whale, dolphin
and seal species. Nine species are relatively common in the area, albeit some only
seasonally. These include populations of the bottle-nosed dolphin (Tursiops
truncates), the nationally critically endangered humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis),
the southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera
eden,). Algoa Bay alone is estimated to harbour about 10% of the South African
population of humpback dolphins.
The seas around Bird Island are famous for their populations of the threatened great
white shark (Carcharadon carcharias), with the reefs around the islands known to
support populations of commercially sought after reef fish, which have been over-
exploited over the last 50 years. Proclamation of the gAENP MPA would assist in
rebuilding these species stocks, protect nursery areas, assist with spawning areas
for chokka squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii), protect the important soft bottom areas
from trawling, and act a source for surrounding areas which in turn would help the
fishing industry (both commercial and recreational) industry.
The two island groups within Algoa Bay (Bird Island and St Croix Groups) are of
great historical and conservation value. A number of birds of conservation

Coastal & Environmental Services
significance occur on the islands e.g. the vulnerable Jackass Penguin (Spheniscus
demersus), South African gannets (Morus capensis), the endangered roseate tern
(Stema dougallii) and the endemic African black oystercatcher (Haemotopus
moquini). The colony of Cape fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus) breeding on Black
Rocks of the Bird Island group represents the easternmost breeding range for this
species.
The Alexandria coastal dunefield is the largest, most impressive and least degraded
coastal dunefield in South Africa, and one of the most spectacular in the world. It is a
classic example of the dynamic nature of geological processes, and it also provides
a unique set of habitats which are not found in other landscapes, namely open sand,
bushpockets and duneslacks, all of which support a range of specialist organisms.
The proposed gAENP would include at least 2km of the Sundays River Estuary,
which is relatively pristine, unlike most other large estuaries in the Eastern Cape. Its
deep channel structure and associated biological processes makes it unique in the
South African context.
Processes
To ensure that the biodiversity pattern in all environments persist in the long term,
the gAENP conservation planning exercise included important ecological and
evolutionary processes e.g. fire, migration, pollination, herbivory, nutrient cycling,
water and sand transfer, to name a few. These processes were identified but more
importantly given spatial parameters and targets essential in the conservation
planning exercise e.g. how much river frontage is required to maintain the critical
ecological processes and how much linkage between the biomes must there be.
These processes were incorporated into the C-Plan (conservation planning)
programme.
Limitations to biodiversity conservation
Limitations to the protection of biodiversity occur mainly in the form of land
transformation whereby natural habitat is transformed into habitat that no longer
supports a high biodiversity. The biophysical specialists determined the extent of the
existing limitations and predicted future limitations to biodiversity. These limitations
have been termed "threats" in the specialist reports and are essentially threats to the
conservation of biodiversity.
Conservation targets
Conservation targets are explicit interpretations of the broad goals of a planning
exercise. A 10% target (IUCN 1989) was applied in this study as a minimum baseline
target for each vegetation land class, and was adjusted upward by a retention target
that took into account current transformation and future limitations to the
conservation of biodiversity. Explicit targets for mammal populations within the
gAENP are the minimum numbers required to maintain a viable population. These
targets for the medium to large mammals were set at either 50 or 200, depending on
their conservation importance (Red Data status and endemicity to the region) and
importance of the population in a national context.

Conservation planning outputs
The conservation planning process through the C-Plan conservation tool identifies
the most optimum'selection of cadastral units for biodiversity conservation. Yet the
challenge remains to optimally exploit the eco-tourism opportunities of these
biologically important areas in synergy with the conservation planning exercise.
Providing sufficient opportunities for eco-tourism is essential for gAENP, as income
from eco-tourism will contribute greatly to gAENP being financially self-sustainable.
Enhancing eco-tourism opportunities will also allow for sufficient economic spin-offs
for the surrounding communities and regional economy.
Results from the various biophysical specialist studies were used to feed a
conservation planning process (C-Plan). Broad areas were categorised based on the
possible role that these areas could play in the development of the gAENP. It is
important to note at the outset that all of the areas identified have been highlighted
as being of critical importance to the gAENP development in terms of meeting
conservation targets set by the consultants for the conservation of biodiversity
patterns and processes. Yet for simplicity eight broad conservation important areas
were identified in the planning domain.
THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
The Eastern Cape is the second largest of South Africa's nine provinces with the
third largest population (6.7 million according to the 1996 census). It is growing at a
rate higher than the national average, with a large proportion of the population being
under the age of 15 years. Despite the size and potential of the province, it remains
the poorest, partly due to historical and political reasons.
The Eastern Cape has a relatively high proportion of low paid workers and high
levels of poverty. The average Gross Geographic Product (GGP) per capita is less
than  half that of South African average. With approximately 710         000  poor
households in the province (4.1 million people), 57% of households and 64% of
individuals in the Eastern Cape live in poverty. Poverty is found particularly in the
rural areas and in the eastern half of the province.

Coastal & Environmental Services
Local communities
The broad planning domain area, inclusive of the towns, has an estimated population
of 27 000 people, but the people (i.e. farm workers and their families) directly
affected by land purchases has been estimated to be 3 267 (Resettlement Policy
Framework - available on www.addoelephantpark.com). The local communities in
the planning domain are typical of the under-developed rural areas of South Africa.
Both farmers and workers appear to have a long history of residency on the parcel of
land on which they currently reside (on average, 33 years per farmer and 22 years
per worker). Mean household size for workers is 4.02 and for farmers 3.4.
Studies have indicated that dairy farms, on average, employ about 15 labourers (i.e.
1 per 50 ha) while small stock pastoralism normally employs about half as many
labourers on six times as large a property (about 1 per 555ha). Dairy farms generally
appear to employ their workers at marginally higher wages of R392 - R673/month in
comparison to the R359 - R561/month on small stock farms, both of which fall short
of the SANParks average monthly wage of about Ri 301 - R2 805/month for
equivalent labourers. Moreover, dairy farmers on average appeared to have a further
1.5 farms under their management, while the pastoral farmers had marginally fewer
with on average of 0.8 further farms. This indicates that on average about 50% of the
farms in the domain are unoccupied by the land owners. This concurs with the fact of
steady depopulation of the rural areas over the last decade, which would account for
the high formal urbanisation level of 89% for the Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage metropole.
Furthermore, only about 25% of the 36 farms purchased by SANParks in the last five
years were occupied by the land owner, tenants or a labourer.
The majority of farm labourers live in settlements that occur in clusters on
demarcated sites. Dairy farms employ more labourers per hectare than small stock
farms. Most workers live in brick houses, very few of them have electricity, some
have vegetable gardens and/or limited stock, with few having extra facilities (e.g.
farm schools, soccer fields).
Mainly male farm labourers receive wages and food rations, whilst the majority of
women depend on natural resources to supplement the household heads income
and, together with children, are the most vulnerable social group.
In terms of the Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights Act (109 of 1996) and other
legislation, tenants are protected when evicted without adequate provisions. The
Extension of Security of Tenure Act (62 of 1997) gives special rights to occupiers
who are 60 years or older and who have lived on the land for 10 years or longer.
Family graves that have been established play a very important role in the spiritual
well-being of many of the local people, with access to such sites within National
Parks having never been denied.
Most households have intact family units. The bulk of the farm workforce is unskilled
and barely literate (around 24% of workers have no schooling), thereby reducing the
chances of employment other than manual labour.
Along with general productivity, the farm survey indicates that the profitability, land
value per hectare and number of workers per farm are substantially higher in the
coastal dairy farms than mixed stock farms further inland. This has implications for
the number of people affected and the value of land.

The mohair producers in the Somerset East, Jansenville and Uitenhage areas
produce at least one third of South Africa's mohair. The southeastern corner of this
region, within a 250km radius of Port Elizabeth, is an important bastion of Angora
goat farming. The loss of certain farming areas is likely to cause the production of
mohair to decline.
Demographics
The demographics of the planning domain were taken from enumerator areas (EAs)
falling within the planning domain and the results of a limited farm survey undertaken
as part of this project are presented in the table below.

CULTURAL RESOURCES
The planning domain is relatively rich in rock art and artefacts, and SANParks has a
policy for the protection of cultural resources. In order to conform to the policy,
SANParks has commissioned a more detailed study, which has produced a draft
framework, that will ensure that the resources will be protected within the gAENP.
Therefore, whilst World Bank Safeguard Policies for Cultural Resources, OPN 11.03
and OP 4.11, are triggered by virtue of the presence of cultural property in the area,
the beneficial land use impact of the gAENP proposal, South African heritage
legislation, SANParks CRM Policy, the gAENP Cultural Resources Framework
discussed below, together with the compilation of a cultural resources inventory,
result in compliance with OPN 11.03.
Major economic activities in the Eastern Cape and planning domain
Economic activities were assessed at the provincial and district levels for the Eastern
Cape Province.
Eastem Cape
The Eastern Cape had the 5th highest GGP (R19 574m) in 1991, but the average
annual growth in GGP from 1991 to 1996 was 1.5%, less than the total average for
South Africa. The high Tress Index indicates a dependency on a few economic
activities, namely manufacturing (25.8%), commerce (16.3%) and services (27.3%).
At 0.603, the Human Development Index (HDI) of the Eastern Cape is lower than the
country as a whole (0.672). The HDI for certain population groups in the rural
districts is comparable to the worst in the world.

Coastal & Environmental Services
The country's economic sectors fall into nine categories, with the tourism industry not
a recognised defined sector. Economic benefits are hidden in the commerce and
agricultural sectors, making the contribution of tourism industries to national GDP
and provincial GGP difficult to quantify. The tourism industry is, however, expected
to be a major growth industry in the province, attracting 12% of the South Africa's
visitors.
The economic sectors most important from an employment point of view in the
Eastern Cape are services (29.8%), manufacturing (18.1%), commerce and
accommodation (15.7%), agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing (13.2%).
The proposed planning domain of the gAENP falls within four municipal areas,
namely Nelson Mandela Metropole, Sundays River Valley, Ndlambe and Blue Crane
Route.
Planning domain
In the planning domain, the agricultural sector is most important sector in rural areas
in terms of labour (contributing 32%) and in providing inputs to the manufacturing
sector, in particular industries such as meat processing, dairy products, fruit canning,
bakery and confectionary. Absolute numbers of people employed in the agricultural
sector are comparable across all districts except the Nelson Mandela Metropole. The
greatest contributor to the GGP in the area is manufacturing.
The most important contributors to GGP in the planning domain are Alexandria (field
crops (R25m) and animal products (R9Om)), Kirkwood (horticultural crops (R38m)),
Port Elizabeth and Somerset East (animal products (R48m and R28m respectively))
and Uitenhage (animal products (R23m)). Although not reflected in the contribution
to GGP, in 1995 the AENP was estimated to generate about R300-400 million into
the national economy by tourists travelling to the park. The knock-on of this industry
is seen in the burgeoning of the bed & breakfast industry in the Addo area from 2 to
19 in a few years. Furthermore, the AENP and other eco-tourism/conservation
operations appear to employ twice the labour force at four times the salary of
comparable pastoral operations.

THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF gAENP
Financial pressures resulting from a reduction in government subsidy has resulted in
SANParks placing greater focus on business efficiency within parks. Each park has
become a "business unit", where they endeavour to fund their own operations and
become financially sustainable.
Total Gross Income (TGI) from small-stock pastoralism (a land use covering
approximately 60% of the planning domain) is estimated to be about R80/ha in
comparison to the R103/ha from game farming (not including income from
ecotourism) and R157/ha from eco-tourism. These figures were calculated using an
area of approximately 135 000ha of similar vegetation type and grazing carrying
capacities. Areas under intensive dairy farming are estimated to have a TGI of about
R177/ha, against which conservation would struggle to compete on purely financial
grounds, yet provides unmeasurable ecological services not provided by the cleared
agricultural land.
Establishment costs for gAENP are considerable, and to determine the financial
viability of the proposed park, financial requirements were determined by one of the
specialists. Results showed that for the park to be financially viable, additional capital
funding of about R170 million would be required to fund mainly land acquisition and
game introductions. However, to a large degree the former is to be achieved via
large donor and government support, and the latter by translocations of game from
other parks. GEF and other multi-donor support is being sought to provide funding
for the establishment of the Park. Financial viability is expected in the sixth year after
project implementation. The projected income from eco-tourism and game sales will
cover the operational costs of this development. The economic benefits from job
creation (over 500 directly from the operations) and other benefits such as
biodiversity conservation and ecological services (clean water, carbon sinks etc)
yield huge unaccountable benefits. The spin-off effects in the area are potentially
high as it gives landowners another option for their land beyond normal agriculture. If
the project does attract the tourist numbers expected, a larger region will benefit
significantly.

THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
The proposed gAENP programme and the SEA take into account the opportunity for
gAENP to alleviate poverty in the region, improve living standards of disadvantaged
communities, satisfactory resettlement where applicable, Black Economic
Empowerment (BEE), sustainable tourism, local employment and outsourcing
strategies while preserving the biodiversity of the area, thus meeting national and
international conservation requirements.
Current institutional framework for conservation management
With many aspects of conservation management shared between national and
provincial competencies, confusion amongst the general public often arises. In most
cases the activities of national institutions are geared towards the development and
implementation of a national framework conservation policy and overseeing the
provisions of a number of international conservation conventions. Provincial
departments, in particular the provincial conservation authority, by contrast, have
been devolved certain powers to implement national policy provisions. The
involvement of a single agency in the gAENP streamlines responsibilities and
implementation. Yet active involvement of provincial authorities in surrounding park
buffer areas remains essential to coordinate legislation and governance.
Existing institutional stakeholders that play a role in tourism
Similarly, many aspects of tourism are shared competencies, leading to very little co-
ordinated tourism support. The provincial and local government institutions in the
Addo area are currently not fulfilling their mandate in terms of stimulating and
supporting tourism businesses in disadvantaged communities. This is largely due to
financial and human resources constraints, while SANParks is attempting to
encourage such developments through the outsourcing process (day/night drives,
concessionaires).

Coastal & Environmental Services
Several sectors, including business, disadvantaged communities and farmers, argue
that the current AENP is not reaching out to people enough, and linking with other
local and regional tourism initiatives. The gAENP will be an international drawcard to
the area, and thus it is recommended that SANParks takes a proactive lead in all
tourism initiatives in the region, and integrate within the tourism sector and across
sectors.

* Coordination with other Government
Departments involved with land and
resource management, particularly in the

* Ensure satisfactory neighbour relations
* Diversity in land ownership models in park
Proposed institutional structures
The gAENP programme is to be developed and implemented primarily by SANParks,
but in coordination with the provincial Department of Economic Affairs, Environment
and Tourism (DEAET), national government departments (Environmental Affairs and
Tourism, Land Affairs, Labour), various non-government organisations (NGOs),
community-based organisations (CBOs), the farming community, academic
institutions, private landowners and private enterprise.
Co-operation and integration of the various institutions will be facilitated via the Addo
Planning Forum (APF) and the to-be-established Park Committee (PC).
ISSUES AND CONCERNS RAISED BY I&APS
The following key issues emerged during the public participation process of the
SEA. Most have already been addressed in the SEA and by SANParks:
* Displacement and relocation of farm workers.
* Ongoing uncertainty as to land purchases.
* Impact on farming related industries and activities.
* Lack of communication with affected parties.
* Impact on unemployment and economic opportunities.
* Impact on dairy, beef, mohair and chicory production.
* Land purchase process.
* Emotive attachment to land.
POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS
The conservation planning process identified areas of importance to conserve and
focused on implementation scenarios. Some of the areas identified as conservation

Coastal & Environmental Services
worthy may not necessarily be bought by SANParks, but certain management
options could be entered into between SANParks and the landowner. This opens an
array of opportunities for landowners who not only wish to conserve their land, but
also to be associated with the gAENP and its eco-tourism attraction.
Management options
Whether the SANParks follows the route of purchasing all land (and proclaiming as
Schedule 1 Park) needed to conserve biodiversity versus purchasing a portion and
entering arrangements with private enterprises for the rest, will be largely moulded
by a need to weigh ecological advantages against the financial, managerial and
social costs.
Including the private sector into the park via contractual park arrangements reduces
costs of land, game purchases and infrastructural development, while harvesting
individual ingenuity. Local communal land (which remains very limited - Enon
Estate) could also be incorporated into the park on such contractual agreements, if
they so desired.
Suggested management scenarios
Two contrasting management scenarios, out of innumerable possibilities, were
examined:
* 70% Schedule 1: 30% Contractual
* 30% Schedule 1: 70% Contractual
The first scenario, with the preponderance of land under Schedule 1 ownership and
management, would appear to present the most favourable option in terms
management. The benefits of a national park in the international sense are great and
management therefore needs to reside largely with SANParks for its long-term
security and international acceptance. The principles driving private enterprise are
largely financial, and are thus very often in conflict with basic conservation principles.
Thus, ideally the bulk of the area or key conservation and attraction areas need to be
under SANParks' control, around which contractual areas can hinge.
Tourism options
The gAENP offers a wide range of eco-tourism opportunities due to its geographic
location, its associated landscapes, wildlife and biological importance and
uniqueness. The tourism opportunities are differentiated into different products
catering for different markets. For example, it will be the only park in Africa to offer a
truly Big 7 experience in addition to biodiversity par excellence. Tourism options
include:
* Coastal Areas where open water activities e.g. boat trips, whale and shark
watching, fishing and diving are possibilities, and along the coastline, for whale
watching, hiking, fishing and general recreation. Unique island experiences
(birds, penguins, seals) would be exclusive experiences. Walking, nature based
activities and overnight accommodation are suitable for the neighbouring
forests. Exposure to the world's largest coastal dunefield is another unique
tourist experience.
• The Thicket Areas are ideal for Big Five tourism, with hunting in some areas.
The Zuurberg Mountains offer excellent opportunities for hiking, 4x4 trails and
possibly some fishing, game viewing and hunting.

Coastal & Environmental Services
The Savanna Areas, especially behind the dune system, offer a wide range of
opportunities. The most important of these will probably include Big Five eco-
tourism and possibly hunting. Activities of a lesser importance include hiking,
walking and 4x4 trails in the less accessible areas, while there are limited
opportunities for fishing along certain sections of the river.
* The Karoo Area has a good potential for Big Five game viewing and associated
hunting, while Darlington Dam offers opportunities for water-based activities that
includes some of the best fresh water fishing available. Hiking and 4x4 trails
may be possible, especially in the mountains.
CONCLUSIONS
Information from the current studies indicate that the gAENP conservation option as
proposed offers a more sustainable and economically viable form of land use for
most of the planning domain, than the current agricultural option. It would provide
greater long term security to the globally important mix of biodiversity and
underpinning ecological processes, as well as providing increasing economic
opportunities for the region. There is strong support for the project from national and
provincial authorities, NGOs, financial sectors and general public. Yet the studies
have elucidated genuine and legitimate concerns from certain sectors of the regional
economy (notably the agricultural sector, in particular the dairy industry) and the
social plight of certain sectors of the labour market, notably the farm workers. Above
all it was felt that the project offers an exciting alternative land use option that could
both enhance biodiversity conservation, while increasing the economic growth and
well-being of the region. It was felt that it could also, through strong SANParks-
private enterprise-community partnerships, produce world leading models in
supporting sustainable development. In addition, the SEA also meets World Bank
triggered safeguard requirements for OP 4.1, OP 4.12 and OP 4.01.
Protecting the unique biodiversity of the area holds numerous opportunities e.g.:
* Meeting international and national conservation responsibilities and obligations
. Eco-tourism opportunities and eco-tourism spin-offs serving as an economic
generator for SANParks, Eastern Cape and South Africa.
. Eco-tourism has limited costs to the environment compared with intensive
farming.
* Preservation of Red Data Species.
* Research opportunities.
• Protection of unknown medicinal plants.
* Opportunities for social and financial upliftment of the local communities.
* Ecological services.
RECOMMENDATIONS
Adopted recommendations
SANParks has already accepted a number of recommendations resulting from the
initial specialist studies and public participation process. These recommendations
have either already been implemented or are in the process of being implemented:
. Restructuring of the Addo Planning Forum (APF) to include a wider
representation and to diversify duties within the APF.
• A Resettlement Policy Framework Document has been completed.

Coastal & Environmental Services
* SANParks has agreed to ensure that the Department of Land Affairs is to be
present at land acquisition negotiations with farmers to inform farm workers of
their rights.
* The boundary of the gAENP will remain dynamic, with land purchases guided
via the C-Plan tool and completion of a land acquisition policy.
* The Strategic Framework for the Conservation of Cultural Resources in gAENP
has been adopted by SANParks (see Appendix 3). The compilation of the
cultural resources inventory will be completed to inform implementation of the
policy and the gAENP.
* In terms of OP 4.01, the SEA has been adopted by SANParks and indicates the
beneficial impact of the project on the environment.
* An effective communication strategy has been designed where regular two-way
communication links are set up to inform stakeholders of programmes and
progress, and enable them to communicate concerns and issues.
Additional recommendations
. A tourism survey to investigate the existing as well as the potential tourism
opportunities of the proposed planning domain, as well as the Eastern Cape.
* Financial assessment of the existing financially viable farming areas i.e. the
mohair producing area.

1. GENERAL INTRODUCTION
The Addo Elephant National Park (gAENP) was proclaimed in 1931 to protect the
last remaining Eastern Cape elephants, living in the Addo area. A founding
population of 11 elephants formed the basis of the now 340 animals. Until 1955,
when the Armstrong fence was erected, the population grew slowly through periodic
population control in the form of shooting by surrounding private landowners. From
the park's original size of 2 270 ha, it has now been expanded to about 120 000 ha
in size.
Although the idea of a gAENP was mooted with the Open Africa initiative in the early
1990s, the proposal by Kerley & Boshoff (1997) well articulated how such an
expansion of the park could encapsulate the unique assemblage of biodiversity and
tourism opportunities in the area. It recommended a linkage of the park's separate
areas, and amalgamation with other conservation areas such as Woody Cape and
Tootabie Nature Reserves to form a core conservation area to protect the unique
biodiversity (see Section 4.2). This greater area is referred to as The greater Addo
Elephant National Park (gAENP).
The Board of the South African National Parks (SANParks) accepted the proposal
for a gAENP and subsequently, with the financial support of the Global Environment
Facility (GEF), in the form of a PDF Block B grant, administered through the World
Bank, specialist studies were commissioned to gather information regarding the
proposed gAENP (see section 3.3 for details of the specialist studies). The aim of
these studies is to consolidate the available biophysical, social and economic
information to prepare a full proposal to GEF for the planning and implementation of
the gAENP project.
One of the commissioned studies was this Strategic Environmental Assessment
(SEA), which aims to:
1. Synthesise all existing information (biophysical, socio-economic and
institutional).
2. Describe the gAENP initiative.
3. Discuss the opportunities and constraints presented by the environment for
the gAENP programme.
4. Describe the socio-economic and biophysical implications of establishing the
gAENP.
5. Identify an option for an acceptable way forward.
6. Present this information to the public, authorities and other Interested and
Affected Parties (I&APs).
The project is being co-ordinated by South African National Parks (SANParks),
principally under the guidance of Dr Michael Knight, Scientific Services and the
gAENP Steering Committee. Coastal & Environmental Services (CES) was
commissioned to undertake the socio-economic, institutional and SEA components,
while the CSIR, in conjunction with the Institute for Environmental and Coastal
Management (IECM) and the Terrestrial Ecology Research Unit (TERU) at the
University of Port Elizabeth undertook the biophysical component.

2.1 WHAT IS THE GREATER ADDO ELEPHANT NATIONAL
PARK?
The proposed gAENP comprises an area of the Eastern Cape that contains an
extremely high biodiversity, yet is poorly conserved. The area would form a
continuous terrestrial conservation area of almost 200km in length, about 30km at its
widest Dart and about 10km at its narrowest. The exact boundaries of the oroposed
park remain uncertain as many factors need to be considered before more
consolidated proposals can be advanced. These are r4is cuss      fuir+hmr in sctn  4. A7
What is biodiversity?
Biodiversity (biological diversity) is the term given to the variety of life on Earth and the
natural patterns it forms. Biodiversity is the result of billions of years of evolution, shaped
by natural processes (such as fire, migration, pollination, predation, disease and
herbivory, which maintain the functional properties of a healthy ecosystem. Biodiversity
also includes genetic differences within species and varieties of ecosystems. Biodiversity
is a complex phenomenon, is not static and not easily measured.
Biodiversity forms an integral part of our existence and has been increasingly altered by
hlumnan populcations wrho have exce,t,ed -pressure on IL,e envir-onmentL 1fo. var io-usI reCasOns. 
These pressures or threats have been exerted without controls to prevent over-
harvesting, overutilisation and degradation of these resources.
At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. world leaders agreed on a comprehensiveI
strategy for 'sustainable development" - meeting our present needs while ensuring that
we leave a healthy and viable world for future generations. One of the key agreements
adopted at Rio was the Convention on Biological Diversity. South Africa is a signatory to
this Convention and thus has a responsibility to preserve biodiversity, hence the
importance of the gAENP initiative.
The Convention esiablished inree main goais:
*  The conservation of biological diversity.
r I le: sUsldtlInIIaes Uo : Ul UIG cUIIImoeUIIII0 Ui UdVUIVersily.
*  The fair and equitable sharing of the benefits from the use of genetic resources.
The study area discussed in this renort; and the other snecialist renorts; is thus
essentially a planning domain, wherein the boundaries are continuously changing as

develop. The planning domain includes a terrestrial area of approximately 340 000
ha (around which a 5km      buffer was included to facilitate information gathering
process) and a marine area of about 100 000 ha inclusive of the St Croix and Bird
Island groups (Figure 2.1).

Coastal & Environmental Services
The proposed terrestrial zone extends north and eastwards from the R75 road near
Wolwefontein, in the west, to include most of the Zuurberg mountain range and the
plains which abut it to the north, a section of the coastal plateau between the
Zuurberg Mountains and the coast, and, further east, a coastal strip, from the
Sundays River mouth to Cape Padrone, which includes the Alexandria coastal
dunefield and the Alexandria forest. Although numerous towns are on the border of
or within this planning domain, SANParks will not purchase any land in towns for
conservation purposes.
The proposed park also includes two sections of the Sundays River, namely a
section of approximately 85km in the hinterland, including the Darlington Dam (Lake
Mentz), and 2km of the lowest part of the Sundays River estuary at the coast. The
marine zone stretches from the mouth of the Coega River to beyond Cape Padrone,
and seawards to include the Bird and St Croix island groups.
Expansion of the park would allow the re-establishment of important ecological
processes essential for ensuring ecological sustainability. The important processes
identified for the terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are discussed in more detail in
Section 4.3.
The proposed gAENP would be South Africa's third largest national park, increasing
the country's terrestrial conservation area from 5.5% to 5.7% and adding to the
country's few marine conservation areas. Given the parks unique assemblage of
biodiversity (representation of six of the country's seven biomes), and linkage with a
marine protected area (MPA), the park would make a major contribution to South
Africas commitment to the international Conventions on Biological Diversity and
Combating Desertification.
The scope of the gAENP programme is envisaged to enhance regional collaboration
between major stakeholders, principally SANParks and Eastern Cape's Department
of Economic Affairs, Environment & Tourism (DEAET), as well as Department of
Land Affairs, Department of Labour, Local Government Structures, local
communities, private enterprise, the farming community, academic institutions, non-
government organisations (NGOs), and private landowners.
The Eastern Cape, with its diverse habitats, can support a number of different eco-
tourism opportunities. The proposed gAENP will be able to support almost all eco-
tourism experiences sought after by tourists - local and international. This will not
only allow the park to generate income, but will have major spin-offs for local
communities, the Eastern Cape and South Africa, as more international revenue is
injected into the country, creating more employment and wealth. In addition, the park
will support basic and essential life-supporting ecological services, a facet which is
difficult to measure, and not often factored into analyses.
The original criteria (see below) that were used to determine the planning domain
and highlight the importance of the park relate to the potential of the proposed park
to achieve certain conservation and development goals. These are in line with South
Africa's developing policies and strategies on the environment. They are spelt out in
detail in the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Convention on the
Combating of Desertification, as well as in the country's White Paper on a National
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                 9



Coastal & Environmental Services
Environmental Policy, the ANC's (1994) Reconstruction and Development
Programme and the South African government's GEAR (Growth, Employment and
Redistribution) initiative.
The 11 criteria that were used to determined the proposed boundaries of the park
(Kerley & Boshoff, 1997) are:
1.     Biodiversity
2.     Spatial complexity/representativeness
3.     Ecosystem functioning
4.     Naturalness and uniqueness
5.     Protection of flagship species
6.     Multi-purpose zones (buffer zones)
7.     Financial viability
8.     Economic potential
9.     Eco-tourism
10.    Management factors
11.    Practical boundaries and physical characteristics
In addition, the proposal was guided by the definition, objectives and criteria for the
selection and management of Category II Protected Areas (National Parks and
Equivalent Reserves), as outlined in the schedule classification in the Government
Gazette of 9 May 1994, Notice 449 of 1994.
2.2 RATIONALE BEHIND THE CREATION OF THE gAENP
The proposed gAENP is of bioregional, national and global importance, possessing
features and conservation worthy aspects unique to this area. The inclusion of six
biomes, together with a marine and estuarine component, would make the park the
most diverse conservation area in southern Africa, and possibly Africa. The following
points are some of the reasons the proposed gAENP planning domain is so unique,
the combination of which cannot be replicated elsewhere in South Africa.
2.2.1 TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENT
. The proposed    gAENP   planning domain already contains areas under
conservation, which could be consolidated to form a core conservation area.
a The expanded park would include representative samples of six of South
Africa's recognised terrestrial biomes' (Nama-Karoo, Fynbos, Forest, Thicket,
Savanna and Grassland) in the internationally recognised Albany hotspot 2
(Figure 2.2).
* A large number of faunal species are supported by the six biomes, including the
important population of the original Addo elephants which attracts a great
number of tourists, the black rhinoceros (both endangered species) and the
important disease-free Addo buffalo population. Lion remains to be introduced,
thus completing the Big 5 eco-tourism product, in addition to their importance as
process agents.
'A major region characterised by its flora, fauna and climate.
2 A recognised biologically important area. A number of studies (Nordenstam, 1969; Croizat, 1965; Court, 1988 &
Hartmann, 1991) have recognised the Albany hot-spot as an important phytogeographical centre for speciation and
endemism.

KILOMETR 
Figure 2.2: Map showing the location of the Albany Hotspot in the Eastern Cape.
. The proposed Marine Protected Area would allow for the addition of two
threatened and one resident whale species and the threatened great white
shark, which will make gAENP the first park to offer a unique Big 7 as an eco-
tourism attraction.
* The elephants in Addo have reached their density limit3, thus SANParks have to
either expand their habitat or cull excess elephants. Expanding the habitat is the
option that has been selected.
* Other Red Data Book species e.g. African wild dog, brown hyaena and serval
are planned to be reintroduced into the park.
. The proposed gAENP offers a wide range of suitable protected habitats for
terrestrial birds, including some Red Data Book species e.g. ground hornbill,
Cape vulture, martial eagle, Stanley's bustard, kori bustard, grass owl and
cuckoo hawk.
* The Port Elizabeth-Grahamstown-King Williams Town corridor is known to have
a high diversity of reptiles and amphibians including two known Eastern Cape
endemic lizards (Tasman's girdled lizard and Cape legless burrowing skink). The
Zuurberg provides particularly important habitat for a high diversity of snakes.
. Information on invertebrates in the planning domain is minimal. Known
invertebrates that will be protected within the gAENP include the endemic dune
grasshopper in the Alexandria dunefields and the flightless dung beetle specially
adapted to exploit the faeces of large herbivores in the dense thicket biome. Two
3Elephants must be carefully managed at low densities to prevent them from damaging their habitat.

butterfly species may also be protected by the proposed gAENP. The
opportunity presented for research could discover many more.
The altitudinal and biological variation available within the park offers important
benefits with respect to tracking the impact of global change on the natural
environment as well as important migration options for animals.
2.2.2 FRESHWATER ENVIRONMENT
. The gAENP study domain shows exceptional diversity in landscape settings,
and consequently in freshwater ecosystem types. This ranges from rivers that
flow infrequently and only for a short duration at a time (in the Karoo) to swamps
and marshes of the Alexandria Forests. Although substantiating data is lacking
at present, it could be predicted that this exceptional diversity at landscape and
ecosystem levels would also be true at the community and species levels.
* The proposed gAENP is a relatively small area that shows very high biodiversity
in terms of freshwater ecosystems. It is speculated that the freshwater diversity
may be higher than what occurs in the entire Kruger National Park.
* The gAENP is also important for conservation of the rare Eastern Cape redfin
minnows. The Addo population is the most eastern population of fish, which is
restricted to the Cape Fold Mountain belt. These fish are particularly vulnerable
to alien predators such as the black bass.
. Little information is available on the aquatic species of this region, which
presents major research opportunities.
2.2.3 MARINE ENVIRONMENT
The existence of a marine area which includes islands (uncommon along the
African coastline), a permanently open estuary (one of the few in the Eastern Cape
Province), and one of the world's largest and unspoilt coastal dunefields, makes the
area a unique Marine Protected Area (MPA). In addition:
. Application of the nationally developed COMPARE4 methodology (Specialist
Report 3) for evaluating MPAs in South Africa affirmed the viability of a MPA in
Algoa Bay. Group scores of 84%, 75% and 85% for achieving "Protection",
"Fisheries Management" and "Utilisation" goals respectively, were determined.
. Algoa Bay is an ideal area to protect breeding and nursery grounds of many
commercially exploited linefish.
* The high degree of endemism5, combined with the presence of vulnerable and
threatened species, affords global significance to the proposed gAENP MPA.
* The major sandy beach ecosystems of the Eastern Cape and their associated
fauna are not conserved adequately, and proclamation of the proposed gAENP
MPA would make an important contribution in this respect by adding about
80km of relatively pristine sandy shoreline to the existing South African MPA
network, which has a poor quota of sandy beaches conserved.
* The Alexandria beach is the longest contiguous and least impacted stretch of
coastline in South Africa where the important diatom Anaulus australis6 occurs,
lending it national significance.
4 Crtera and Objectives for Marne Protected Area Evaluation.
5 Endemic species are found only in a particular and usually restricted geographic area or region.
6 Surf diatoms are an extremely important source of food to animals living within the surfzone and on adjacent
sandy shore beaches. Anaulus australis accounts for over 95% of the primary production along the Algoa Bay
shoreline.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                      12



Coastal & Environmental Services
* About 280 species of macroalgae are reported from the Algoa Bay area, of
which about 38% are endemic to South Africa.
* Marine invertebrate species diversity and endemism of the South African
coastline peaks in the Algoa Bay area, with about 45% of species endemic to
South Africa. An MPA in the Algoa Bay area, in conjunction with existing marine
reserves, would place over 86% of endemic marine invertebrates under
protection.
* A MPA sited in the Algoa Bay area would significantly increase the number of
endemic coastal marine fish afforded protection.
* Of the 23 seabird species regularly seen in Algoa Bay (one quarter of the
seabird species recorded in South African waters), half are Vulnerable,
Threatened or Near-threatened. Eight of the 15 South African resident seabird
species breed in Algoa Bay, either on islands or on the shore of the adjacent
coast.
The island groups of Algoa Bay support the largest population (43% of the global
population) of the vulnerable African penguin, endemic to southern Africa. They
also support significant populations of Cape gannet (39% of the global
population), which is also endemic to southern Africa, and the roseate tern.
Virtually the entire Indian Ocean breeding population of Antarctic tern also roosts
on Bird Island during the winter months.
Nine of the approximately 30 South African species of whale, dolphin and seal
are relatively common in Algoa Bay. During spring a large population of
threatened southern right whales, Eubalaena glacialis, enter the bay and calve
in the inshore waters of the proposed marine reserve.
The seas around Bird Island are famous for their populations of the threatened
great white shark, Carcharadon carcharias.
The Sundays River estuary is of particular conservation significance. Of the 289
river mouths along the southern African coast, the Sundays River is one of only
37 (or 12.8%) that maintain a permanent connection with the sea. The Sundays
River estuary is ranked eighth out of the 42 estuaries studied in terms of
diversity (Turpie, 1995).
Algoa Bay is an area of high diversity, being in the overlap between
biogeographical regions, and approximately 38% of the algal species occurring
in Algoa Bay are endemic to South Africa.
2.2.4 SOCIO-ECONOMIC AND ECO-TOURISM
* The Eastern Cape Province, and in particular the eastern half, with its relatively
high human population (third highest in the country) and high incidence of
poverty has been identified by the South African Government as one of the
provinces most in need of socio-economic development. The establishment of
the gAENP would assist in poverty relief and socio-economic development of the
area. Chapter 5 assesses the opportunities presented by the socio-economic
environment for the gAENP.
* The existing AENP already has a relatively well-developed eco-tourism industry
that is making a positive contribution to the regional economy. Since
conservation related forms of land use (such as game farming and eco-tourism)
have been found to be economically and environmentally more sustainable than
livestock farming in thicket vegetation (Stuart-Hill & Aucamp, 1993), the
expansion of the park potentially offers further socio-economic yet
environmentally friendly development opportunities to the province as well as
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment FINAL                   13



Coastal & Environmental Services
employment opportunities for local people. The fact that the Eastern Cape
Province now boasts over 500 game farms, twice as many as a decade ago, is
significant of the economic justification for this industry.
2.3 THE MISSION AND OBJECTIVES OF THE PARK
SANParks' mission for the gAENP is "To create a park of global significance,
conserving the unique mixture of biodiversity, unsurpassed in southern Africa, in one
geographic region for the benefit of all".
Specific objectives are:
* To conserve in perpetuity the biodiversity patterns and processes characteristic
of landscapes and habitats associated with the complexity of the Eastern Cape
region.
* To enhance socio-economic benefits for the region by promoting a sustainable
eco-tourism industry as an economic engine.
SANParks aims to achieve these objectives by:
The protection of areas with high, unique and threatened biodiversity.
The protection of the minimum area necessary to maintain ecological patterns
and processes within the system as a whole and the separate biome
components.
. Securing the long term conservation of important components and reduce
critical threats facing the park.
Formulating and implementing a park conservation plan.
. Promoting a sustainable ecotourism industry based upon the biological and
aesthetic resources of the park.
Promoting the value of conservation amongst the surrounding communities.
. Facilitating inter-institutional cooperation and management of the project.
. Promoting capacity building in neighbouring communities as a means of
enhancing the economic potential of the region through environmentally
accepted development options.
2.4 SUPPORT BASE FOR THE gAENP
2.4.1 GOVERNMENT
The national Government supports the establishment of conservation areas for the
protection of biodiversity, as South Africa is a signatory to the Convention on
Biological Diversity (Rio de Janeiro 1992), and therefore is duty bound to establish
reserves for the conservation and sustainable use of threatened species, habitats,
living resources and ecological processes.
The proposed terrestrial component of the gAENP will satisfactorily conserve
biodiversity by conserving 5 of the 7 terrestrial biomes occurring in South Africa and
their associated vegetation types. Some of the vegetation types are poorly
conserved and the gAENP will substantially increase the percentage of these under
conservation. See section 4.2 for more detail on percentages of vegetation types that
will be conserved.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                 14



Coastal & Environmental Services
The implementation of Marine Protected Area (MPA) policy and an understanding
that a target of 20% of the nation's coast be protected (as recommended by the
World Conservation Union (IUCN)) has been enshrined under objectives D2.1 and
D2.2 of the White Paper on Sustainable Coastal Development in South Africa
(WPSCD, April 2000).
A Committee for Coastal and Marine Systems, established by the Council for the
Environment, recommended 12 marine and adjacent onshore areas as candidates
for special protection and management by a conservation body. One of these areas
is the Woody Cape coast from the mouth of the Sundays River eastwards to Kenton-
on-Sea, including the Bird and St Croix island groups (Payne & Crawford, 1989).
MPAs collectively cover 17% of the South African coastline, although only about
4.9% of the coastline has all forms of exploitation prohibited. Additionally, the
conservation of representative portions of each marine and coastal ecotype has not
been achieved, and the sandy shores of the Eastern Cape are not adequately
protected in the current MPA network of South Africa (Attwood et al., 2000). The
proposed gAENP MPA would rectify this situation.
2.4.2 FINANCIAL SUPPORT
Financial support has been forthcoming from a number of sources. The Global
Environment Facility (GEF), through the World Bank, agreed to support the gAENP
proposal in the form of a Project Development Fund (PDF) Block B grant to
consolidate information towards drafting a full proposal to GEF. The current
specialist studies and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) have been funded
by this grant. Information from these studies will be used to guide the expansion of
the park along accepted biological and socio-economic criteria. The GEF funded
project is predominantly a desktop information assimilation exercise.
DEAT has allocated just over R52 million for the Addo project. The objectives of this
poverty alleviation programme include: a) Creating employment, b) Utilising labour
for development of the park, c) Training, uplifting and creating SMMEs in order for
local people to be able to continue with the programme even after poverty relief.
Projects include erecting new fences, fence removals, rehabilitation of farmsteads,
upgrading existing tourist roads and the entrance road from N2 to link up with current
areas, small new rest camp, and eradication of jointed cactus. About 300 - 350
people would be employed in this phase and about 500 in the following phase.
A total of R3.2 million has been allocated to the Working for Water programme
around Addo this year. A number of employment opportunities exist in this
programme for the eradication of alien plants within the planning domain.
2.4.3 PUBLIC
In recognition of the environmental significance and development potential of the
gAENP, a stakeholder workshop was held in February 1999 during which the
following was declared:
* Support for the greater Addo Elephant National Park concept.
* Recognition of the global importance of its biodiversity.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL               15



Coastal & Environmental Services
. Recognition of the potential for sustainable social benefits at the regional,
national and global levels.
* Awareness of the urgency and need for progress on the greater Addo Elephant
National Park.
. Recommendation for the continuation of the application to the Global
Environmental Facility and other potential sources of funding, including national
government.
Recognition for the need to address all issues raised at the workshop,
particularly the need for a feasibility study, the incorporation of stakeholder
concerns, and clarity on institutional structures and roles.
Calls for these issues to be integrated into a proper investigation, planning and
communication process to be implemented by the restructured Addo Planning
Forum.
Calls for the South African National Parks to drive the process in co-operation
with provincial and other stakeholders.
This same workshop also called for a reconstitution of the Addo Planning Forum to
include a broader base of stakeholders. The Addo Planning Forum now meets once
a quarter and includes representatives from East Cape Nature Conservation,
Department of Land Affairs, Department of Water Affairs, Local Government offices,
Local communities, Local Economic Development, Business (PERCCI)), East Cape
Tourism Board, PE tourism, Agri Eastern Cape, Sundays River Irrigation Board
(SRIB) and NGOs. The main functions of this forum are:
. To ensure that stakeholder interests are known and fully considered by
SANParks.
* To communicate progress and planning proposals to stakeholders.
The current public participation process has also indicated that although there are a
lot of queries and concerns, overall the gAENP programme is supported (Section 8
(this volume) and Specialist Report 5 deals with public issues and mitigation
measures in more detail). Certain parties will be negatively affected and ways of
reducing the severity of these effects will need to be explored.
2.5 WHAT GUARANTEES ARE THERE THAT THE INTERESTS OF
THIRD PARTIES WILL BE CONSIDERED?
The World Bank Safeguard Policies are designed to safeguard the interests of third
parties who may be affected by Bank operations. The following policies were scoped
to determine which are triggered:
* Operational Policy 4.01: Environmental Assessment
* Operational Policy 4.02: Environmental Management Plan
* Operational Policy 4.04: Natural Habitats
* Operational Policy 4.07: Water Resources Management
* Operational Policy 4.12: Involuntary Resettlement
* Operational Policy 4.11: Cultural Property
• Operational Policy 10.04: Economic evaluation of investment operations
. Good Practice 14.70: Involving non-governmental Organisations in Bank-
Supported Activities
* Bank Procedure 17.50: Disclosure of Operational Information
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                16



Coastal & Environmental Services
* Operational Directive 10.70: Project Monitoring and Evaluation
Through intensive consultation with the Bank, it was agreed that OP 4.12, OP 4.11
and OP 4.01 are triggered.
Operational Policy 4.01: Environmental Assessment
This project falls into a Category B project as defined in OP 4.01. In the initial stages
of the project, agreement was reached with the National Department of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism and the Bank that whilst OP 4.01 was triggered,
an SEA would be the most appropriate instrument to meet the requirements. The
SEA has taken the natural (air, water, vegetation, faunal, soil, agriculture, geology
and landform) and social aspects (involuntary resettlement and cultural property) into
consideration. The SEA was initiated early in project design, and is closely integrated
with the economic, financial, social and technical analyses of the proposed project.
This SEA meets many of the content requirements for a Category B project (OP
4.01b), although opportunities and constraints presented by the environment are
considered rather than the expected impacts of the project on the environment. An
Environmental Management Plan (EMP) (OP 4.02) has not been included in this
SEA as this will form part of Phase 2 after public and authority concerns have been
incorporated and specific projects within the gAENP initiative are implemented.
Where detailed environmental assessments may be required, South Africa's
Environmental Impact Assessment regulations will be triggered and complied with
(see Section 3.1 for more detail). These are considered best practice in middle
income countries and meet World Bank requirements.
Operational Policy 4.12: Involuntary Resettlement
A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), including an Income Restoration plan, has
been developed as part of this project and addresses all requirements of OP 4.12. In
addition Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) have been compiled for households to be
moved in the short term i.e. priority farms. The RAPs are detailed plans for each
specific household. Farm labourers are generally unskilled or trained only as farm
workers. Being removed from their environment will place them at a disadvantage
when moved to a society where they may not have skills to compete effectively.
The RPF will be developed in parallel with a social impact assessment, with the
same social scientist leading both components, and in consultation with the
government and affected communities. Due to the nature of the proposed project,
some people may have to be relocated and it is inevitable that some people will be
adversely affected, as resettlement is a disruptive process. The RPF will strive to
ensure that potentially adverse effects on most of these people are mitigated or
avoided.
A Social Monitoring Programme has been developed as a part of the current studies
(Specialist Report 8). This report contains guidelines on the different categories of
stakeholders and criteria to be monitored. This programme will be extended and
implemented as part of the Communication Strategy and the Resettlement Policy
Framework.

Coastal & Environmental Services
Operational Policy 4.11: Cultural Property
The Bank's general policy regarding cultural properties is to assist in their
preservation, and to seek to avoid their elimination. SANParks will ensure that
cultural property e.g. graves, gravesites and bushman paintings are protected as the
conservation of the diverse cultural heritage is part of its business as well as the fact
that it could contribute towards enhancing the tourism potential of the area.
Local graves and gravesites will not be relocated from their original positions.
SANParks will allow controlled (for safety reasons from potentially dangerous animal
species) access to graves and gravesites.

3. THE GREATER ADDO ELEPHANT PARK STRATEGIC
ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT
3.1 WHAT IS AN SEA?
During discussion with SANParks, the Department of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism (DEAT) and the World Bank, it was agreed that the preferred approach to
planning the gAENP would be to undertake a Strategic Environmental Assessment
(SEA). An SEA looks at the socio-economic and biophysical environment of a
proposed programme in order that an environmentally satisfactory programme can
be developed before it is adopted.
An SEA does not preclude the need to undertake separate Environmental Impact
Assessments (ElAs) in terms of national EIA Regulations at the point that such
regulations may need to be complied with. Further, compliance to Bank policies as
evidenced by OP 4.12 will take place for the duration of the project.
In general SEAs are a widely accepted instrument for integrating environmental
issues into the formulation of plans and programmes, by ensuring that these issues
are addressed from an early stage and incorporated throughout the process. The
main benefits of an SEA are to:
* pro-actively inform the development of plans and programmes;
. identify the opportunities and constraints that the environment places on
development;
* provide guidelines to ensure that the development is within sustainable limits;
integrate across areas, regions or sectors;
* improve the way in which cumulative effects are dealt with in environmental
assessments; and
• focus on the maintenance and enhancement of a chosen level of environmental
quality, rather than on minimising individual impacts.
The goals of the SEA for the gAENP are to incorporate environmental and social
aspects into the higher level planning process to ensure these aspects are
considered in the gAENP planning process by dealing with them early on in the
process. This will enable all opportunities (or positive impacts) presented by the
environment to be enhanced and the constraints (or negative impacts) to be
minimised.
Stakeholders and other Interested and Affected Parties (I&APs) have been
encouraged to become involved in the process from an early stage, to ensure that a
transparent planning process is achieved.
The conservation planning, socio-economic and institutional assessments
undertaken as part of this GEF funded study fed into the SEA to assist in the
identification of:
* Social, economic and biophysical resources that should be maintained and/or
enhanced;
. Social, economic and biophysical trends on all relevant scales, which will
influence the maintenance and enhancement of these resources; and
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                 19



Coastal & Environmental Services
The existing institutions, legislation, policies, plans and programmes that will
influence the maintenance and enhancement of the environmental resources.
It should be noted that environment is defined broadly to include both social and
biophysical aspects. This is in line with Chapter 5 of the National Environmental
Management Act (NEMA) of 1998. Hence, the aim is to identify, describe and
evaluate the significance of the various linkages between social and natural aspects
of the environment, thereby providing better information to the decision-maker.
It should also be noted that the spatial scale of the specialist studies undertaken
varied, depending on the topic under investigation. Hence, for instance, the
biophysical and social assessments focus on the study area, whereas the legal,
economic, tourism and institutional assessments include a broader area in order to
consider the inter-linkages between the proposed gAENP and the Eastern Cape
Province as a whole. This approach may be termed a nested focus, whereby the
area including and immediately adjacent to the proposed park is the primary focus
for investigation, but areas further afield are considered with respect to their
interaction with that focus area.
Although only one overriding land use option is being considered, i.e. conservation,
various options regarding boundaries and institutional and management strategies
are considered.
3.2 HOW WAS THIS SEA UNDERTAKEN?
The gAENP SEA process has involved interaction with specialists, the client,
authorities, the World Bank and the public. Figure 3.2 is a schematic representation
of the process being followed for this SEA.

3.3 WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE SEA?
The study team consisted of the following institutions and members:
* Coastal & Environmental Services (CES): Dr A.M. Avis, as project manager, was
responsible for managing the socio-economic specialist studies and together with
Michelle Griffith co-ordinated and managed all aspects of the SEA and
synthesised and integrated the key findings into the final report. Ndumiso
Nongwe was part of the social assessment team and assisted with farm surveys.
Sub-consultants were assigned to various subtasks as follows:
. Dr Charlie Shackleton, Rhodes University (Environmental Science
Programme) assisted with the project management of the socio-economic
specialist studies.
. Sandy Wren and Mazizi Msutu, of Sandy and Mazizi Consulting, were
responsible for the public participation process and drafted an Issues
Response Trail (Specialist Report 5).
. Teresa Connor, of T. K. Consulting, was involved with farm surveys and
assessed various socio-economic aspects within the planning domain
(Specialist Report 6).
. Prof. Chris de Wet, Rhodes University (Anthropology), drew up a
resettlement framework plan (Specialist Report 7).
. Maura Andrew, Rhodes University, drew up the Social Monitoring
Programme (Specialist Report 8).
* Bev Geach assisted with the socio-economic and tourism institution studies
and investigated policies applicable to the proposed gAENP (Specialist
Reports 9, 15 & 17).
. Prof. Geoff Antrobus, Rhodes University (Economics and Economic
History), undertook the cost benefit analysis (Specialist Report 10).
. Richard Davies produced economic forecasts for tourism options in the
gAENP (Specialist Reports 11 - 13).
* Herman Timmermans (Rhodes University, Institute of Social and Economic
Research) and Lawrence Sisitka produced the institutional assessment of
the planning domain (Specialist Report 14).
. Imbewu was responsible for determining the legal issues regarding the
expansion of the park (Specialist Report 16).
. Prof. Robin Palmer, Maura Andrew and Sheona Shackleton, Rhodes
University, were involved in various expert workshops to discuss the
opportunities  and  constraints  presented  by  the  socio-economic
environment for the expansion of the park.
* AFRICON Engineers were responsible for including cadastral and census
data into GIS databases and maps.
The CSIR-TERU-IECM consortium produced the conservation plan (C-Plan) for
the proposed gAENP (Specialist Report 1), which included terrestrial and aquatic
components. Principal CSIR participants included Dr B. van Wilgen, J. Nel, S.
Davies and 1. Mitchell, with substantial support from Dr M. Lombard, and were
responsible for consolidating the conservation plan. The Terrestrial Ecology
Research Unit (TERU - Prof R. Cowling, Dr A. Boshoff and Prof G. Kerley)
focused on the terrestrial conservation planning aspects (vegetation mapping,
conservation planning protocols and mammal planning exercises) (Appendices 4

3.5 HOW WAS THE PUBLIC INVOLVED?
3.5.1 INTRODUCTION
Public participation by its very nature is a dynamic process with various sectors of
society often having needs, values and interests that conflict. According to the
Development Facilitation Act 67 of 1995, public participation is important because:
It introduces local knowledge and understanding of local needs.
It generates ideas.
It broadens the debate.
It leads to more satisfaction and inclusive decisions.
It contributes to capacity building and reducing dependency when people have
participated in the formulation of decisions.
* It can be used to transfer skills for income generating purposes.
Sandy & Mazizi Consulting were appointed as independent consultants by Coastal &
Environmental Services to facilitate the Public Participation Process for the proposed
gAENP programme. Specialist Report 5 contains more detail on the public
participation process.
3.5.2 APPROACH TO PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
The goal of the gAENP public participation process is:
"To create opportunities for l&APs within and around the study area to receive
information, participate in the process, and raise issues and concerns with
regards to the establishment of the proposed greater Addo Elephant National
Park so that they may be considered as part of the decision making process."
A four-phased approach to public participation was developed in consultation with
the representatives of the National Department of Environmental Affairs and
Tourism, Provincial Department of Economic Affairs Environment and Tourism,
South African National Parks, Coastal & Environmental Services and Sandy & Mazizi
Consulting.
* Stage One: Identification of and networking with Interested & Affected Parties
(I&APs)
* Stage Two: Communication strategy (ongoing)
* Stage Three: Draft SEA and Issues Report
* Stage Four: Final SEA and Comments Report
Stage One: Identification of and networking with Interested & Affected Parties
(I&APs)
The identification of l&APs in an area the size of the gAENP planning domain is a
difficult task. I&APs were identified as follows:
* Existing database supplied by SANParks from the 1999 Stakeholders Workshop.
* Newspaper advertisements requesting I&APs to register.
Networking and consultation meetings with identified l&APs.
* Advertisement in the East Cape Game Management Association Publication.
* Newspaper Advertisements were placed as follows:
* National - Sunday Times, Sowetan and Rapport
* Local - Die Burger and The Herald
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                  25



Coastal & Environmental Services
Issues and concerns were gathered via submissions as a result of the newspaper
advertisements, telephonic discussions with l&APs and networking and consultation
meetings..
Networking meetings are an additional mechanism used to identify l&APs, issues
and concerns. Networking meetings are one-on-one meetings between the
participation consultant and key l&AP groups. In these meetings background
information is provided on the project, the SEA and the participation process is
explained. I&APs are also provided the opportunity and to raise issues and
concerns.  The proposed gAENP covers 400 000 hectares, in order to identify
issues and concerns for consideration in the SEA, the networking meetings focused
on the active participation of directly affected l&APs.
Out of a database of 495 I&APs, 234 were recorded as having participated in
networking meetings.
The following provides an overview of the groups consulted:
Civic Organisations, Farmers Associations, Landowners, Businesses, Farm
Labourers, Labour Unions, Local Authorities, Councillors, Community Based
Organisations, Surrounding Landowners and Residents Associations.
Stage Two: Communication Strategy (ongoing)
Communication with l&APs is an ongoing activity that occurs for the duration of the
project. This includes holding public meetings, distributing briefing papers, written
communication with l&APs and networking meetings. It is a gradual process of
sharing information and in so doing developing the capacity of l&APs to actively
participate in the process.
To facilitate communication with l&APs, a Briefing Paper translated into English,
Afrikaans and Xhosa was developed and distributed. The Briefing Paper provided
I&APs with background information on the project, the process and timeframe for the
SEA and Public Participation Process as well as a map of the planning domain.
As part of the ongoing communication process all l&APs on the database were
notified in writing of the availability of the Draft SEA and were invited to attend Public
Information Meetings where on overview of the SEA was given and an opportunity
provided for comment.
All reports and project-related information have been made available on the CES
website.
Stage Three: Draft SEA and Issues Report
The issues identified during stage one of the process have been forwarded to the
specialist consultants and project proponent for their consideration and response.
This has been included in the Issues and Response Trail as part of the interim Public
Participation Report to be released for l&AP comment.
The Draft SEA, including the Participation Report, Issues and Response Trail was
released at the end of March 2002 for l&AP comment. A comment period of 28 days
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL               26



Coastal & Environmental Services
was provided. To facilitate feedback, copies of the Draft SEA and Specialist Reports
were placed at strategic locations within the study area for I&APs to view.
Due to the rural nature of the area farmers associations and local authorities were
provided with copies of the Draft SEA in order to facilitate public comment. In
addition, all l&APs on the database were mailed a copy of the Executive Summary of
the Draft SEA and Issues and Response Trail.
During the public comment period Public Information meetings were held to provide
l&APs with an overview of the Draft SEA and facilitate comment on the report. The
Draft SEA was also be made available on the CES website.
Stage Four: Final SEA and Comments Report
This stage of the process involves the submission of the final report to the involved
authority for comment. The report will contain additional comments received from
I&APs during the review stage and outline the participation that has been
implemented.
3.6 WHAT ARE THE CONSTRAINTS AND LIMITATIONS OF AN
SEA?
As with most programme assessments, limitations exist due to the challenges of
applying SEA guidelines to the gAENP SEA.
Fundamental altematives: The most critical limitation of this SEA is that it does not
adequately address fundamental alternatives. The goals for this SEA (as outlined in
Section 3.1) focus on the establishment of the gAENP. Consequently, the specialist
studies and the research undertaken as part of the SEA were aimed at, in part -
"Identifying and assessing the social environment in relation to the ideals associated
with the gAENP". Similarly, all research on the biophysical environment has focused
on conservation planning. The consequence of this is that the SEA does not
adequately address the alternative of improving the status quo by, inter alia,
providing recommendations to advance agricultural production in the area. This
limitation is tempered to a certain extent by the fact that it also does not discuss the
limitations to agriculture in any detail.
Furthermore, the lack of an analysis of alternatives is often the case in any
development where the alternative option is usually the status quo, as neither a
proponent, nor funds have been sought or offered to advance the status quo.
Incremental altematives: The SEA does examine incremental alternatives in the form
of various development options for the gAENP and some boundary options.
Opportunities and constraints: It was found to be difficult to separate opportunities
and constraints for the gAENP from those of current land use. Frequently a
constraint for one option could be perceived as a benefit for the other, and visa
versa. Since the SEA specialist studies focused on the gAENP option, less
information on current land use was collected for comparative analysis, making it
difficult to identify both opportunities and constraints. However, the cost-benefit
analysis was undertaken to specifically address this limitation.

Coastal & Environmental Services
Sustainability criteria: This limitation is more specific in that criteria concerning
sustainability are more readily applied to the natural environment than in a social and
economic context. It is relatively easy to establish criteria of environmental quality,
to decide which natural resources need to be maintained or enhanced, to consider
alternative approaches and to set levels of acceptable change. It is more difficult,
and in some areas impossible, to apply these criteria in assessing socio-economic
sustainability in communities, and economic/financial sustainability overall.
Information gaps: One of the aims of this project was to accumulate and assess
available information. Information gaps have thus been identified by the process and
are presented in Section 3.7.
3.7 WHAT ARE THE MAJOR INFORMATION GAPS?
This section describes gaps in the existing knowledge base, and gaps in process
and implementation of the gAENP that were identified during the course of the
proposal investigation. The priority projects listed below in Table 3.7 are evenly
balanced between the three managerial imperatives:
- Understanding biodiversity (B): This pertains to inventorisation (or pattern
analysis) of the biological diversity in the gAENP.
- Understanding its ecological function (E): This relates to the processes
behind the above diversity i.e. To make sure this biodiversity pattern is not lost.
- Effective park management (M): How best to manage the biodiversity to
sustain it in the future.

3.7.1 INFORMATION GAPS LIMITING THE SEA
Cultural resources: A cultural resource inventory was not included as part of the
original Terms of Reference for this phase of the planning of the gAENP. However, a
Strategic Framework for the Conservation of Cultural Resources in gAENP was
prepared and is included as Appendix 3. Also, as outlined in Appendix 3, a first-
phase cultural mapping of the gAENP is being carried out to inform the
implementation of the Framework.
Tourism market analysis: The lack of a clear understanding of present tourism trends
in the Eastern Cape was an important information gap. A thorough tourism market
analysis is required to accurately determine the viability of the gAENP as an eco-
tourism destination. Tourism data are available, but further analysis is required to
determine inter alia the number of tourists, where they come from, why they come,
their destination, what they spend, what tourists most look for, potential for tourism to

grow, job creation possibilities and possibilities for community-based tourism. There
is also an inadequate understanding of micro-economic (e.g. Bed & Breakfast)
resources in the planning domain. Links with tourism organisations to plan and
encourage tourism in the Eastern Cape are required.
Financial Management: The lack of available data needed to determine a robust
financial model for the entire park, has also been identified. A financial model for the
present (expanded) park was developed as part of this SEA (see Specialist Reports
10 - 13 and Chapter 6). This model covers a known area of 156 000ha. It is not
possible to develop a robust financial model for the expanded park, as the exact
boundaries are not known at this time. This is a result of the dynamic and fluid nature
of the C-Plan model, which aims to optimise biodiversity conservation arising from
land acquisition. Thus, as suitable land is purchased, changes to the exact boundary
of the park occur.
3.7.2 INFORMATION GAPS TO BE INSTIGATED AT THE IMPLEMENTATION
PHASE
Wildlife utilisation: The demand for live game, especially disease-free buffalo, in the
future is unknown. As the sale of game can be a major source of income for the
park, this information should be monitored. Other uses of wildlife in the Eastern Cape
also need be monitored.
Legal aspects: Various gaps in legal information were identified:
. Title deed searches for servitude, usufructs, mineral rights and restriction
information is required. (e.g. usufructs, servitudes and interdicts).
* Land claims searches.
* Investigations of tenure rights.
* Water use registrations and licensing investigations.
* Grazing rights associated with Darlington Dam need be assessed.
* All permits issued to third parties by national and provincial nature conservation
officials need to be investigated and decisions made in regard to their retraction
in certain cases and the payment of compensation. For example, permits issued
for the removal of marine resources from the marine area of the park may need
to be retracted.
* Although limited communal land exists in the planning domain, SANParks has no
intention of purchasing any properties, but would actively consider contractual
arrangements.
In spite of these difficulties and information gaps, it is possible to assess the
opportunities and constraints presented by the environment for the proposed
gAENP.

4. THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT
The natural environment consists of the terrestrial and aquatic (freshwater and
marine) environments. Since the main goal of the gAENP is to preserve the
biodiversity of the region in perpetuity, biodiversity priority areas were determined
using a strategic GIS conservation-planning tool, called C-Plan (C-Plan, 2001).
4.1 WHAT IS CONSERVATION PLANNING?
Conservation Planning is a tool used to identify conservation priorities in an area in a
systematic and defensible manner. Priority areas are those areas that would ensure
biodiversity pattern as well as the natural processes that support and drive it, is
protected.
The conservation planning process for the gAENP conservation programme dealt
with:
* The identification of existing biodiversity (Section 4.2).
. The identification and spatial representation of biophysical patterns and
processes (Section 4.3) present in the planning domain.
. The identification, spatial representation and projection of current and future
limitations (threats) to the preservation of biodiversity (Section 4.4).
. Setting of targets (Section 4.5) to ensure representation and persistence of
biodiversity pattern and process in the gAENP planning domain.
Once the patterns, processes and limitations present in the planning domain had
been determined and targets set, various options for achieving the minimal area
necessary for reaching conservation targets were identified, using C-Plan. This
process is a dynamic one, and as new areas are added to the reserve system or are
transformed by development, the optimal alternatives for reaching conservation
targets change.
It is important to note that the outputs of the C-Plan analysis represent just one of
several options for achieving conservation targets. The choice of which alternative to
implement will be determined by other considerations such as social and economic
sustainability. The C-Plan analysis merely indicates which areas are important, but
does not make recommendations as to which management models may be
appropriate for implementation. Thus many areas selected to achieve conservation
targets may be more appropriately managed as off-state proclaimed areas but under
some form of contractual arrangement with SANParks. Deciding on appropriate
forms of conservation management for each selected property is therefore an
important part of implementation.
4.2 HOW BIODIVERSE IS THE PLANNING DOMAIN?
4.2.1 TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENT
Biodiversity of the terrestrial environment was determined by mapping the 43
identified land classes/vegetation types scattered amongst the six biomes occurring
in the planning domain.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                31



Coastal & Environmental Services
The terrestrial environment is diverse and consists of the Algoa dunefield in the
southeast, which is backed by the Indian Ocean (Alexandria) forest. Moving
northwards from the coast towards the Zuurberg, a variety of mesic thicket types
occur, and two intrusions of mesic thicket into the Indian Ocean forest reach almost
to the coast. Fynbos/grassland mosaics occur on the Zuurberg in the central area.
Nama Karoo intrusions occur in the north and west of the domain (Figure 4.2a). The
east-west aligned Zuurberg range dominates the central part of the planning domain.
The Alexandria forest receives the highest rainfall in the planning domain and the
areas north and west of the Zuurberg the least.
Biomes
The thicket biome is the largest biome represented within the gAENP, covering 69%
of the planning domain. It is characterised by dense thicket vegetation with a broad
range of plant growth forms and a high diversity of woody shrubs and succulents.
Endemism is high, particularly of geophytes7 and succulent forbs.
The other biomes are relatively small, with Forest occupying 10%, Nama Karoo, 7%,
Fynbos, 5%, Grassland, 5% and Savanna, 4%.
The presently fragmented Alexandria Forest occurring within the planning domain, is
unique and endemic to the Eastern Cape. The proposed gAENP will serve to
consolidate the fragments and protect them as one conservation unit. Areas of
Afromontane forest will also be protected in the Zuurberg Mountains.
The Nama Karoo occurs on the semi-arid central plateau of South Africa and is
characterised by dwarf shrublands. It is poorly conserved and possibly has a high
degree of endemism and plant diversity. The Eastern Mixed Nama Karoo is the most
degraded of all vegetation types in South Africa and supports the highest diversity of
plant species recorded in the Karoo.
The Fynbos biome has an exceptionally high species diversity and endemism and
occurs mainly in the mountainous areas on sandstone soils.
The vegetation type of the Grassland biome within the proposed gAENP consists
predominantly of the poorly conserved Coastal Grassland type.
Although the the Savanna biome is the country's largest biome, it is relatively poorly
represented in the gAENP and Eastern Cape by the poorly conserved Eastern Thorn
Bushveld.

Fauna
A number of faunal species already exist in the protected areas within the planning
domain. The most conspicuous and well-known is the Addo elephant (Loxondonta
africana). The elephants are of a high conservation status and are considered to be
keystone8 species in Subtropical Thicket. The black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis
bicomis and D. b. michael,), both endangered species, bred so successfully given
the high quality environment, that excess animals have been relocated to other
areas within their range. Black rhinos are another important tourist attraction. The
proposed park will also be important for the conservation of a broad suite of
conservation worthy species, many of which have Red Data Book status but are
overlooked purely because they lack charismatic appeal, such as the important
flightless dung beetle (Circellum bacchus), the endemic dune grasshopper (Acrtylos
hirsutus), hairy-footed gerbil (Gerbillurus paeba exilis) and butterfly such as the
(Aloeides clark,). See Specialist report 1 (Appendix 5) for more details.
4.2.2 FRESHWATER ENVIRONMENT
Biodiversity of the freshwater environment was measured by noting the physical
pattern of each aquatic ecosystem, with the major rivers classified according to 3
levels to develop unique "river signatures".
The Sundays River and its tributaries form the most significant river system that
flows though the gAENP. The Sundays River, which is of great value for irrigation in
the lower Sundays Valley, extends well beyond the boundaries of the proposed park,
but significant tributaries or at least their headwaters occur within the proposed park.
These include the Coerney, Krom, Wit and the Klein Uie rivers. Other important river
systems that flow within the planning domain are the upper Bushmans River with its
tributaries, the Blou and Steins rivers (northeast), and the Boknes River and its
tributaries (southeast). The Sundays and Boknes rivers are the only rivers within the
planning domain that flow into the sea (Figure 4.2b).
The Darlington Dam (previously Lake Mentz) is a large (4 350 ha) impoundment
within the proposed park that receives Orange River water through interbasin
transfer. The Sundays River Irrigation Board manages the water release programme.
Entire river drainage systems or catchments are recognised as ideal conservation
units, as they comprise discrete ecosystems and allow management of most
associated ecological processes. Incorporating entire catchments into conservation
areas is, however, rarely feasible, and the proposed gAENP is no exception. In this
regard the subcatchments of the Sundays (Coerney, Krom, Wit and the Klein Uie
rivers) remain important, as would part of the Bushmans River catchment in the
gAENP.
Nine different types of waterbodies occur in the gAENP, each having a complement
of biotopes with characteristic flora and fauna, that collectively add to the broad
diversity of the park. The freshwater ecosystems include: perennial rivers; seasonal
rivers; episodic rivers; ephemeral rivers; permanent and semi-permanent vleis;
seasonal vleis: springs and seeps; episodic endorheic pans; forest swamps and
marshes.

Coastal & Environmental Services
A number of threatened faunal species rely on these waterbodies for their survival
e.g. freshwater eels require the marine, estuarine and freshwater sections of the
gAENP during their complicated life cycle; redfin minnows (Barbus afer) are a small
but very visible and attractive freshwater fish species in the clear waters of Cape
Fold mountain streams and a number of unique and endemic species occur in
temporary pools. A number of these species and freshwater systems are under
threat from inappropriate river empoundments and developments, active
introductions of alien species such as large-mouth bass, and indirect introductions of
species through the interbasin transfer programme.
4.2.3 MARINE ENVIRONMENT
Biodiversity pattern and process of the marine environment was determined using
known marine-estuarine features mapped from SA Naval Charts and expert
knowledge.
Algoa Bay
Algoa Bay is recognised as being part of the South Coast marine biogeographical
province (equivalent to the terrestrial biomes, Hockey & Buxton 1989) of South
Africa. The potential to create a Marine Protected Area (MPA) along this stretch of
the coast and to link up with the two offshore island groups and the terrestrial
component of the park is of national and international significance, as recommended
by the IUCN (Kelleher 1999). Given its biological importance in protecting a wide
variety of habitats (islands, beaches and estuary), and a large number of vulnerable
species (e.g. jackass penguins, roseate terns, humpback dolphins), and over-
exploited fishes and critical life stages of some of these species, the area featured
very highly on the national COMPARE evaluation technique used by Marine &
Coastal Management in assessing the importance of marine areas (see Specialist
Report 3).
The proposed gAENP-MPA will be situated along the northwest to north shoreline of
Algoa Bay. The bay coastline extends for 90km between the headlands of Cape
Recife in the west and Woody Cape in the east, and includes some 80km of surf-
swept beaches. These beaches and their associated surfzones vary widely in
physical form. Two large, perennial rivers that drain extensive catchment areas, the
Swartkops and the Sundays rivers, flow into the bay. The Islands of the Cross,
comprising St Croix, Brenton and Jahleel, are located between the Swartkops and
Sundays river systems, 2-3 kilometres offshore. A second group, the Bird Islands
consisting of Bird, Seal, Stag and Black Rocks, are located approximately 8km
offshore from Woody Cape and 65km distant from Port Elizabeth harbour. Both
island groups occur inside the 30m depth contour.
As Algoa Bay is at the extreme east of the Agulhas Bank, the fish fauna is made up
of species found on both the east and (to a lesser extent) west coasts of South Africa
(Japp et al., 1994) and many are endemic to South Africa.
The marine mammal fauna of South Africa comprises in excess of 30 whale, dolphin
and seal species. Nine species are relatively common in the area, albeit some only
seasonally. These include populations of the bottle-nosed dolphin (Tursiops
truncates, the nationally critically endangered humpback dolphin (Sousa chinensis),
the southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) and Bryde's whale (Balaenoptera
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                 36



Coastal & Environmental Services
eden,). Algoa Bay alone is estimated to harbour about 10% of the South African
population of humpback dolphins (see Specialist Report 3).
The seas around Bird Island are famous for their populations of the threatened great
white shark (Carcharadon carcharias), with the reefs around the islands known to
support populations of important commercially sought after reef fish. Algoa Bay is
important as the number of South African endemic fish peaks off Port Elizabeth - a
result of the mixing of east and west coast fishes. Furthermore, with exploitation of
fish stocks having increased over the last 50 years, there has been a collapse of the
line fishing industry. Of the 27 commercially exploited line fish, 19 (70%) have
collapsed (see Specialist Report 3), hence the government state of emergency for
this industry (Government Gazette No. 21949 of 2000). Proclamation of the gAENP
MPA would assist in rebuilding these species stocks, protect nursery areas, assist
with spawning areas for Chokka Squid (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii), protect the
important soft bottom areas from trawling, and act a source for surrounding areas
which in turn would help the fishing industry (both commercial and recreational).
The importance of Algoa Bay in the chokka squid industry is recognised nationally as
the fourth largest fishery industry. Sustaining the important spawing grounds in the
bay thus remains a priority.
Islands
The two island groups within Algoa Bay (Bird Island and St Croix groups) are of
great historical and conservation value. The St Croix Island group currently supports
the largest population of the vulnerable (Brooke 1984) jackass penguin (Spheniscus
demersus) in the world. This is also one of the few populations of this species to be
showing an increase in numbers, emphasising the conservation significance of this
site.
The colony of South African gannets (Morus capensis) on Bird Island is the largest
colony of this species, and the largest gannetry in the world. Until recently, these
birds provided the basis for a lucrative (but ecologically devastating) guano harvest.
The penguin and gannet colonies on the islands of the Bird Island group also
represent the easternmost colonies of these species. Likewise, the colony of Cape
fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus) breeding on Black Rocks of the Bird Island group
represents the easternmost breeding range for this species. Other seabirds of
conservation significance which occur on both island groups include South Africa's
most threatened marine bird, the endangered (Brooke 1984) roseate tern (Sterna
dougallii) and the South African endemic African black oystercatcher (Haemotopus
moquini), also classed as a keystone species, which is a near-threatened resident
sensitive to human disturbance during breeding in summer.
Six of the seven islands in Algoa Bay are classed as Important Bird Areas, as they
are inhabited by threatened and endangered species and because they hold more
than 5 000 waterbirds (Barnes 1997), including five seabird keystone species i.e.
African penguin, Cape gannet, roseate tern, Antarctic tern and kelp gull. The
importance of the islands for seabirds as breeding and roosting sites derives from
the fact that they are the only seabird islands along a 1 800km stretch of coastline
between Dyer Island near Hermanus in the Western Cape Province and Inhaca
Island in Mozambique. Bird Island remains the most important of the roseate tern's

three breeding islands along the South African coast, while it is the only summer
roosting island for the Antarctic tern.
The islands, and particularly Bird Island, appear to be an important site for the
heavily exploited abalone Haliotis midae, which is near the eastern extremity of this
species, as well as a suite of other rocky shore macrofauna. The bay appears unique
in that near the island group there seems to be an overlap of the two rock lobster
species (Panulirus homarus and Jasus lalandii) and the deeper water South Coast
Rock Lobster P. gilchristi.
Dunefields
The Alexandria coastal dunefield is the largest, most impressive and least degraded
coastal dunefield in South Africa, and one of the most spectacular in the world
(McLachlan, Sieben & Ascaray, 1982). The dunefield comprises 120km2 of open
sand, is 50km long and averages 2.2km wide, with dunes rising from the beach to
heights of 150m. The dunefield is a classic example of the dynamic nature of
geological processes, and it also provides a unique set of habitats which are not
found in other landscapes, namely open sand, bushpockets and duneslacks, all of
which support a range of specialist organisms (Kerley, McLachlan & Castley, 1996).
The Alexandria coastal dunefield also supports two endemic animals, the dune
grasshopper (Acrotylos hirsutus) and the dune hairy-footed gerbil (Gerbillurus paeba
exilis).
The Alexandria coastal dunefield also provides breeding habitat for rare (Brooke,
1984) Damara terns (Sterna balaenarum) and African black oystercatchers. The
population of Damara terns breeding in the Alexandria Coastal Dunefield represents
nearly 25% of the total South African population (Watson & Kerley, 1995) of this
highly threatened species (Brooke 1984), and is the only such colony in. the Eastern
Cape, the next closest colony being at De Hoop, in the Western Cape.
Sundays River Estuary
The proposed gAENP would include at least 2km of the Sundays River Estuary,
which is relatively pristine, unlike most other large estuaries in the Eastern Cape,
which have been extensively developed. Estuaries are widely recognised as being
crucial breeding and nursery areas for a wide variety of fish species of commercial
and recreational value, and the proposed park would therefore provide an
opportunity to manage such a resource in a sustainable and unified manner with the
adjacent MPA.
Estuaries are an important part of the aquatic environment, forming transitional links
between rivers and the sea. Although estuaries constitute a small part of the area
and an even smaller part of the volume of the total marine hydrosphere, they play a
vital role in the life history and development of many marine populations. Without
estuarine ecosystems, saltwater commercial and recreational fisheries would be
significantly altered. In the USA, about 65% of the shellfish and fish catches depend
on estuaries to complete their life cycle, hence their similar importance to the South
African industry.
Estuaries rank among the environments most affected by humans. Human activities
have resulted in catastrophic changes for some systems - having been dredged or

filled and transformed into seaports, marinas, industrial parks, cities and garbage
dumps.
4.3 WHAT ECOLOGICAL PROCESSES WILL BE CONSERVED?
To ensure that the biodiversity pattern in all environments persists in the long term,
the gAENP conservation planning exercise included important ecological and
evolutionary processes e.g. fire, migration, pollination, herbivory and nutrient cycling,
all of which maintain biodiversity. These processes were identified but more
importantly given spatial parameters and. targets essential in the conservation
planning exercise e.g. how much river frontage is required to maintain the critical
ecological processes and how much linkage between the biomes must there be.
4.3.1 TERRESTRIAL PROCESSES
Terrestrial processes are determined by environmental factors such as topography
and climate, as well as biological processes for mammals. Key biological processes
for the larger mammals of gAENP were captured in the C-Plan to ensure the
persistence of these species in the landscape, and to serve as umbrella species for
other taxa (e.g. smaller mammals, birds and invertebrates). Terrestrial processes
were grouped into three levels:
i.    Landscape-level processes
ii.   Population-level processes
iii.  Species-level processes
Some of these critical processes are illustrated in Figure 4.3.
Landscape-level processes
Fifteen key biological landscape-level processes were identified for the gAENP
planning domain. These processes operate within nine spatial components indicated
below:
1.    Upland-lowland gradients: These ensure ecological diversification of plant
and animal lineages along extended upland-lowland gradients; local scale
adjustment of species distributions to long term climate change along
extended upland-lowland gradients and regional scale adjustment of species
distributions to climate change (Figure 4.3).
2.    Macroclimatic gradients: These are important for the diversification of plant
and animal lineages in relation to macroclimatic gradients. At least three
types of east-west gradients are required: those running along the coastal
lowland, inland lowland regions and along the Zuurberg in the upland region.
3.    Upland-lowland interfaces: These transition zones occur between upland
and lowland land classes. They have a high heterogeneity, and therefore act
as surrogates for ecological diversification. Three upland-lowland interfaces
were identified within the planning domain: Upland - grassland and fynbos
land classes, and the Tootabie Forest; Coastal lowland - those land classes
south of the Zuurberg; and Inland lowland - those land classes north of the
Zuurberg.
4.    Biome interfaces (ecotones): These generally have a high diversity and are
important ecological diversification zones. Boundaries between the forest,
thicket, grassland, fynbos and Nama Karoo biomes were buffered by 500m
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                  39



Coastal & Environmental Services
to derive a spatial component for this important biological process (Figure
4.3).
5.    Hybridisation zones: Thicket interfaces are areas of high plant species
hybridisation, particularly within the genera Aloe and Euphorbia.
Hybridisation zones within the gAENP planning domain occur at the contact
areas of Zuurberg Montane, Sundays Basin and Sundays Inland land
classes. Since hybridisation is an important factor in plant speciation, these
are zones of significant evolutionary change.
6.    Riparian corridors: Riverine corridors along the Sundays and Kabouga river
valleys represent important riparian corridors within the gAENP planning
domain. These rivers breach the folded belt to link inland and coastal
habitats, and are therefore crucial to the migration and diversification
between inland and coastal biotas. Shorter riverine corridors that allow for
animal migration and movement through mountainous terrain, but which do
not necessarily link inland and coastal biota9 were also identified using
topographical terrain, and expert knowledge of the area (Figure 4.3).
7.    Sand movement corridors: The planning domain includes one, large sand
movement corridor, namely the Algoa dunefield. It also acts as a surrogate
for several key biological processes, and forms an important link between
the terrestrial and marine environments (Figure 4.3).
8.    Fire: Natural fire regimes exist in fynbos and grassland land classes. These
land classes exist as islands, surrounded by non-flammable land classes.
Sufficient "islands" must be included to allow for natural fire regimes to
develop.
9.    Rainfall gradients. These must be included to act as drought refuges in
drought-prone habitat. Areas to the north of the Zuurberg are drought-prone
and large refuges are required for the plains game living in these areas.
The Zuurberg range, particularly the eastern portion of the Zuurberg, plays a key role
in the persistence of many of these processes. This is driven largely by the areas of
contact between the fynbos and grassland biomes. Almost the entire coastal portion
of the gAENP planning domain is key to the persistence of important biological
processes, this being driven by the presence of the Algoa dunefield, as well as the
biome interface between the Klipvlei Asteraceous Fynbos and Woody Cape Thicket
land classes. Section 4.7 discusses in more detail how these processes have been
captured in the C-Plan analysis.
Population-level processes
Population-level processes include demographic, genetic and evolutionary
processes, and each relies on minimum-sized populations of species to maintain
them. Processes at the population level focussed on larger mammals and assumed
that the mammals could move freely throughout the entire planning domain of the
proposed park.
The outputs of the mammal population processes study are expressed as targets
(see Section 4.5), and were used in the C-Plan analysis to test the effect the different
land parcels have in achieving mammal targets.

Coastal & Environmental Services
Only natural land within the gAENP planning domain was used in the C-Plan
analysis to test the effect the different land parcels have in achieving mammal
targets.
Species-level processes
Species-level processes focussed on larger mammals, the assumption being that
these mammals qualify as 'umbrella' species since their minimum area requirements
are likely to be at least as comprehensive as those for the remainder of the fauna.
By maintaining a viable population of each mammal species that potentially occurs in
the planning domain, species-driven processes will inherently be captured. For each
process identified, an assessment of the contribution the different mammal species
make to that process was undertaken.
These processes potentially occur throughout all mammal habitat classes in the
gAENP planning domain and a description of them can be found in Specialist Report
2.
4.3.2 FRESHWATER PROCESSES
Biological attributes and processes in rivers and streams are controlled by the
physical and chemical attributes of the landscape through which they flow. Stream
biota are therefore considered to be protected by conserving the habitat template or
pattern (Southwood, 1977). To ensure long term persistence of biodiversity, four
ecological and evolutionary processes were identified (see Specialist Report 2 for
more detail):
1.  Hydrological regimes include the variance in the natural flow of rivers. These
components interact to maintain the dynamics of habitats and determine the
distribution of freshwater and riparian species. It is also the key to the transfer
of nutrients, sediment, pollutants and organisms to larger streams or
estuaries. Natural disturbances, such as droughts and floods, are particularly
important for maintaining the geomorphological integrity of freshwater
ecosystems.
2.  Nutrient cycling is the process whereby elements such as nitrogen,
phosphorus and carbon move through an ecosystem. When considering
nutrient cycling in rivers, it is important to look at all of the processes taking
place in and along whole catchments.
3.  Migration is the movement of species (migration) between habitats.
Longitudinal connectivity in rivers is important for biota to move up and down
the catchment to complete their life cycles (e.g. eels, mullet and many
invertebrate species). Riparian corridors are important for distribution of
vegetation and movement of terrestrial fauna such as otters. Local-scale
movement of species is important, especially during times of habitat change
or climatic disruptions, e.g. movement into refuge areas to survive during
floods, droughts or the dry season.
4.   Succession and evolution. Patterns of faunal assemblages in temporary water
ecosystems are established by coloniser or pioneering species on a "first
come first serve" basis. It is therefore very important to maintain a significantly
large number of these types of waterbodies to keep the natural diversity of
species assemblages at a sufficiently large, randomly variable level to ensure
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                 41



Coastal & Environmental Services
that the overall diversity of recorded species occurring in temporary waters in
the region is not impaired.
4.3.3 MARINE PROCESSES
Four key ecological processes that drive the pattern of biodiversity within Algoa Bay
were spatially defined. These processes are:
1 . Freshwater-estuarine-marine linkages and exchanges. Estuaries are defined
by the mixing of fresh and seawater masses. This forms a critical process for
many faunal species whose life cycles depend on the functional linkages
between these water masses.
2.   Larval dispersal. The vast majority of marine and estuarine invertebrates and
fish have a pelagic larval phase in their life history, which constitutes the
dispersal stage for many benthic invertebrates. Larval dispersal is also
extremely important for recolonisation of disturbed areas or new habitats.
Larval dispersal is poorly understood in this area, but most data indicate that
most larvae within Algoa Bay are concentrated very close inshore and along
western and northwestern shorelines.
3.  Aquifer discharge and associated sustenance of Anaulus australis driven
surfzone ecosystems. The surf diatom, A. australis, constitutes an integral
component of the ecological functioning of the Sundays Beach nearshore
zone, accounting for over 95% of the primary production along this shoreline.
A. australis is in turn predated upon by a wide variety of fish and
invertebrates, fuelling a complex nearshore foodweb. Standing stocks of A.
australis along Sundays Beach are proportional to the amount of nutrient
entering the surf from the adjacent Alexandria dunefield. This aquifer
discharge is thus vital to the success of the surf diatom.
4.  Nutrient import to islands. On a daily basis approximately 200 000 seabirds
migrate from the islands of the Cross and Bird Islands to foraging waters
throughout Algoa Bay and beyond, returning to the islands at night to roost.
These foraging migrations are believed to play an extremely important role in
the functioning of waters in the vicinity of the islands.

4.4 WHAT ARE THE LIMITATIONS TO BIODIVERSITY
CONSERVATION IN THE PLANNING DOMAIN?
4.4.1 INTRODUCTION
Limitations to the protection of biodiversity occur mainly in the form of land
transformation whereby natural habitat is transformed into habitat that no longer
supports a high biodiversity. The biophysical specialists determined the extent of the
existing limitations and predicted future limitations to biodiversity. These limitations
have been termed "threats" in the specialist reports and are essentially threats to the
conservation of biodiversity.
4.4.2 TERRESTRIAL ENVIRONMENT
Four types of land transformation were identified as the most important spatial
limitations to the future protection of terrestrial biodiversity in the planning domain.
These were agriculture (grazing and cultivation), human settlement-related impact,
invasive alien plants and mining.
Several land classes are currently in very good condition with little or no
transformation. This is particularly true of the higher lying vegetation in the centre of
the planning domain. However, several lowland land classes are severely impacted
by over-grazing or development by formal agriculture. The conservation of the
biodiversity of 29 of the 43 land classes (67%) is potentially limited by further
transformation.
The protection of biodiversity of the Alexandria and Schelmhoek dunefields is also
threatened by the introduction of alien vegetation used in stabilising the dunes
thereby changing the characteristics and function of the entire system.
Development of the planned Coega harbour and industrial area adjacent to the park
is expected to have considerable negative impacts in the form of general pollution
(atmospheric, marine, light, invasive aliens and noise), in addition to knock-on effects
such as increased road, rail traffic and other developments, all of which are largely
incompatible with conservation.
4.4.3 FRESHWATER ENVIRONMENT
The key limitations to biodiversity conservation of freshwater ecosystems in the
gAENP are:
* Alteration of natural flow regimes of the rivers - including impoundments (dams
and weirs), unnatural seasonal agricultural demand for irrigation, abstraction,
diversions, causeways and inter-basin transfers.
. Catchment degradation and erosion - mostly due to farming (overgrazing,
drainage of wetlands, roads, quarries, use of fertilisers and pesticides), forestry
and urbanisation.
* A large proportion of the forest in the Alexandria area continues to be
cleared for pastureland. Alexandria forest swamp is possibly the least
known of wetlands and this is seriously threatened by these activities.
Alien species (fauna and flora)
* One of the main threats to freshwater biodiversity is alien fish species such
as black bass and catfish. Since river systems are longitudinal, alien fish
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                 44



Coastal & Environmental Services
species, once introduced, can move up and down a river system as far as
their physiological tolerances will permit them.
* Alien invertebrate species could also be a threat, in particular crayfish,
which displace the natural crab community and cause bank collapse
because of their burrows. The invasion of rivers by the alien snails
(Lymnaea columella), a carrier of liver flukes, and Physa acuta, a
widespread and abundant snail in many waters, is well known. The extent
of this invasion in the gAENP, and its impact on both freshwater and
terrestrial biota is probably severe but very little data is available.
* Alien trees such as wattles also pose a major problem. They reduce the
water flow and cause bank collapse, also reducing the diversity of the
riparian vegetation by excluding other species. The tamarisk Tamarix
ramosissima around Darlington Dam, which has also invaded
watercourses, is another specific problem species that has replaced much
of the natural riparian vegetation in this region of the gAENP.
Information on the above limitations within the gAENP planning domain is too
incomplete to allow spatial quantification. However, available information will be used
during the design phase to make choices between different sites, and to use as a
means of scheduling implementation.
4.4.4 MARINE ENVIRONMENT
Ten issues were identified as key limitations to the conservation of the marine and
estuarine biodiversity of Algoa Bay.
1. Over-fishing/extraction (i.e. exploitation by man, through recreational,
commercial and illegal harvesting) is probably the most important present and
future limitation to the conservation of the biodiversity in Algoa Bay.
2. The proposed development of a deepwater port at the mouth of the Coega
River presents a highly significant future limitation to the proposed gAENP
MPA, as the eastern breakwater of this port will literally define the western
border of the MPA. The port will service a proposed large back-of-port
Industrial Development Zone, which could have major repercussions for the
proposed MPA as well as the islands.
3. Pollution of tWe marine environment of Algoa Bay is, and will remain of critical
concern. Domestic waste, stormwater runoff, the disposal of dredge spoil from
the Port Elizabeth harbour and farming practices (use of herbicides and
pesticides) are important pollutants.
4. Invasive species introduced through activities such as shipping (e.g. ballast
water release) and mariculture are a major concern to the marine
environment. The possible introduction of pests, primarily rats, to the islands
is also a major threat to the survival of bird eggs and chicks.
5. Alterations and pollution of the Alexandria aquifer will be a major limitation to
the success of surfzone phytoplankton and associated ecosystems.
6. Alterations to freshwater flow in the estuary is the key current and future
threat to the Sundays River estuary, and alterations have the potential to
affect almost every aspect of the functioning of these systems.
7. Ineffective policing and management of areas outside of the proposed MPA is
a limitation for those animals that travel beyond its borders, as well as the
potential for pollutants and unwanted organisms to travel into the MPA.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                   45



Coastal & Environmental Services
8. Tourism and recreation can be a serious limitation to the protection of
biodiversity if over-utilisation of the area occurs.
9. Oil and natural gas exploration offshore of Algoa Bay would result in
limitations due to increased shipping, pipeline construction, potential oil spills,
and drilling activities.
10.1Lack of awareness and understanding of the value, both spiritually and
economically, of the natural resources of marine and estuarine environments
of Algoa Bay, and indeed the entire South African coastline, are current and
potential limitations to the proclamation of any protected area and to natural
resources of the coastline.
4.5 WHAT ARE THE CONSERVATION TARGETS FOR THE
gAENP?
Conservation targets are explicit interpretations of the broad goals of a planning
exercise. The IUCN Caring for the Earth strategy (IUCN 1989) set a target for
conservation of at least 10% of each biome or habitat type. This target, although
arbitrary, faces growing acceptance worldwide. The 10% target is applied in this
study as a minimum baseline target for each land class, and is adjusted upward by
the retention target that takes into account current transformation and future
limitations to the conservation of biodiversity. The outcome of this step is a set of
quantitative targets that are required for conserving biodiversity pattern and
ecological processes.
Targets to maintain biodiversity sustainability are driven by SANParks' conservation
planningl0 and biophysical" goals.
For terrestrial biodiversity pattern and processes, quantitative targets were set for
land classes based on their conservation importance, and the levels of threat that
they faced. A baseline pattern target of 10% of the area of homogenous land classes
was assigned to Forest, Mesic Thicket, Grassland, Nama Karoo, Dune Pioneer and
Estuarine communities, and a baseline target of 20% of heterogenous land classes
was assigned to Xeric Thicket and Fynbos. The additional 10% in these areas acts
as a retention that boosts rare and vulnerable target species.
Explicit targets for mammal populations within the gAENP are the minimum numbers
required to maintain a viable population. A baseline target of 50 individuals for
normal species and a retention target of 200 individuals for Red Data Book species
has been established. The rationale for the retention target is that these are the most
vulnerable to threat, and the retention would boost their baseline target. Certain
gAENP species with special and rare features were also assigned a retention target,
namely the disease-free buffalo, the FIV-free lions, Cape Mountain zebras,
elephants, black rhinos and aardvark, to name a few. Ideally a population of 2 000
'°The goal of the gAENP conservation planning module is to identify options for establishing an expanded park
within the planning domain that will conserve, in perpetuity, representative and viable biodiversity patterns and
underlying processes within the planning domain, and to accommodate resilience to threats and environmental
change.
"lgAENP will conserve, in perpetuity, representative and viable biodiversity patterns and underlying processes within the
planning domain of this national conservation priority, and will drive the targets required to maintain biodiversity
sustainability.

Coastal & Environmental Services
individuals is at a level that allows natural evolutionary processes to persist, but this
would only be met for a few species.
The overall targets for nine land classes exceed the remaining area of
untransformed habitat available, and restoration will be necessary to augment the
available areas and to meet the required target. In these cases, there are no options
for conserving different parts of the land class, since more than 90% of the remaining
habitat will be required.
For the proposed gAENP MPA the following key features and processes are
important targets for the restoration and preservation of biodiversity:
. The Sundays River estuary is a critical area for recruitment and the key
management issue is the maintenance of adequate flow to prevent mouth
closure.
* Removal of alien vegetation in the Skelmhoek Dunefield needs to be carefully
managed to maintain natural sand movement processes and thereby prevent
sedimentation of the estuary.
* The productive nearshore waters are highly dependent on maintenance of water
flow through the Alexandria Dunefield.
* The eastern portions of Sundays Beach and surfzone are highly productive and
it is therefore recommended that these dunes be protected by a restricted
access area stretching about 10km from of the Sundays River mouth eastwards
towards Woody Cape.
* The island groups and surrounds, which are critical bird breeding areas, need to
be protected from the introduction of rodents and disease. Only Bird Island is
suitable for the development of limited public access and associated small
volume tourism, though the other islands may be viewed from entirely boat-
based operations.
* The nearshore slope to the east of the Bird Island complex provides a complex
topographic diversity, and is representative of deepwater communities which are
generally poorly conserved.
* Nearshore reefs are critical to fish stocks, and the sandy corridors connecting
these reefs are vital squid spawning grounds. As the location of these reefs is
not well defined, protection of the entire nearshore area needs to be a
conservation target.
Formulation of targets for conserving the freshwater ecosystems of gAENP was
done in conjunction with terrestrial conservation planning consultants to facilitate the
development of an integrated terrestrial and aquatic conservation plan for gAENP.
The following explicit targets were formulated for the conservation of biodiversity
patterns and processes for rivers and streams within the gAENP planning domain:
* At least one river with a unique signature12 of physical pattern (either Level 2 or
Level 3 signatures) must be conserved. This target aims to conserve a
representative spectrum of biodiversity pattern. Additionally, since the whole
river is selected, important biological processes are also maintained.
* Riparian buffer strips should be at least 500m wide on each side of the river and
for at least 80% of the length of the rivers and streams that are selected under
12 Information on the type of freshwater ecosystem, ecoregion and geomorphological zone was integrated to
produce a feature that represents the biodiversity pattern for main streams and rivers in the gAENP. This feature
is referred to as a "signature".

Coastal & Environmental Services
the first target. This target recognises that river ecosystems consist of more than
just the river channel and the water that flows in it, but includes the riparian
ecosystems.
Where options exist, and two or more rivers had the same signature, a number of
considerations were used to determine the conservation priority of each river.
Quantifiable targets could not be set for lentic13 ecosystems, as spatial presence-
absence data does not exist for these systems. However, data that does exist for
wetlands and pans was used in the conservation planning process.

GAENP?

conservation importance of the area, and only the most obvious have been selected,
thus the list is not exhaustive. Measures to optimise opportunities and minimise
constraints to ensure long term sustainability are presented in Section 4.7 of this

Biodiversity conservation
The nature of the biophysical environment will create opportunities for conservation
in a range of different habitats, which will conserve biodiversity for present and future
generations thus furthering SA national and international commitments.
Meeting conservation responsibilities
Protection of the biodiversity of the area presents an opportunity for South Africa to
meet economic and ecological sustainability, in addition to satisfying international
and national conservation responsibilities.

thereby placing them under stronger conservation management.
Underdevelopment
The natural environment of the planning domain consists of large tracts of
undeveloped land, thus making consolidation and expansion of the existing
protected areas feasible.
Alien vegetation
The manageable number of alien species presents the opportunity for large amounts
of transformed land to be restored to its natural state and reduces restoration costs
for SANParks, in addition to placing its eradication under single managerial control.

Climate change
The size and altitudinal variation of the proposed gAENP makes it less vulnerable to
future climate change than smaller and more uniform protected areas. The physical
size and altitudinal variation also present opportunities to the environment to adapt to
the effects of climate change on various processes e.g. animal migration.
Low agricultural potential
The farms in the less productive Zuurberg area have a low agricultural potential - for
these farms in particular, participation in the gAENP represents an opportunity, since
agricultural incomes are precarious and erratic. The Zuurberg also provides the
altitudinal variation important in climatic change planning.
Nama Karoo area
The incorporation of a significant area of Nama Karoo into the proposed gAENP will
not only increase the area conserved, but will also provide an important benchmark
site which can be used to evaluate the recovery of degraded veld and the relevance
of the desertification model to changing veld condition. This would be in accordance
with South Africa's commitment as a signatory of the Convention to Combat
Desertification.
Research
Primary research and education opportunities exist in this expanding park where
issues associated with rehabilitation are important.
Species conservation
The gAENP will be able to support viable populations of endangered species such
as elephants and black rhinos. Including the marine component into a protected area
will allow for the protection of a high diversity of flora and fauna, including a high
number of endemic and Red Data species.
Fish stocks
The area also has a high re-stocking value if protected, as it is a breeding ground for
many important fishery and recreation faunal species. The combination of the
islands, estuary and dunes offers critical conservation opportunities.
Islands
The islands have a high conservation and historic value as well as protecting a large
number of Red Data species and the biodiversity of the marine environment.
Sundays River
The Sundays River, which runs through the proposed park, presents opportunities
for catchment protection as well as availability of water and recreation in certain
areas. It also forms an important linkage between terrestrial and marine conservation
- an important point stressed by the IUCN.
Eco-tourism
The size and diversity of ecosystems creates opportunities for diversified ecotourism
with a range of experiences. It also offers the opportunity to stock the area with
indigenous game. The size will allow for viable populations of most species.

Sustainability
The majority of the conservation targets identified during the conservation planning
exercise can potentially be met in the gAENP planning domain, which will ensure
long term sustainability of biodiversity.
Cultural resources
The planning domain is relatively rich in rock art and artefacts. SANParks have a
policy for the protection of cultural resources and in order to conform to the policy,
SANParks has commissioned a more detailed study. This study has produced a draft
framework, as contained in Section 4.8. This will ensure that the resources will be
protected within the gAENP.
4.6.2 CONSTRAINTS
Fragmentation
The footprint is divided by servitudes for roads, railway lines and power lines. This
fragmentation is aesthetically unattractive and increases management, fencing and
infrastructural costs but can be over come with either under- or over-passes.
Visibility
Game is not easily visible in thick vegetation, which makes for different tourism
opportunities in different areas.
Sundays River
The Orange River inter-basin transfer makes the flow of the Sundays River largely
unnatural.
Fishing
Constraints in the form of reduced or curtailed exploitation of reef fish in the
proposed Marine Protected Area (MPA) against SANParks' current policy that does
not allow the fishing of reef fish in protected areas. It is highly likely that there will be
major objections to the banning of this activity and that poaching will occur. This will
necessitate policing of these areas. Another related constraint is the poor
management of areas (e.g. Cape Recife) outside of the Marine Protected Area that
are important to the birds, which could jeopardise the success of the area.
Existing agricultural potential
Some of the areas proposed for inclusion in the park have a high agricultural value
(e.g. Alexandria dairy area). Traditional eco-tourism may not be able to compete in
these areas. These areas are also usually highly transformed and land prices are
high due to their agricultural potential. Land clearing, which enhances the agricultural
value and hence potential selling price of a farm, but diminishes the conservation
value of such a farm for inclusion in the gAENP, is a major constraint as the
biodiversity of the area is then compromised.
Competing land use
The proposed Madiba Bay project may also provide a measure of competition for the
gAENP. There is also the potential that some game species e.g. lions will conflict
with some neighbours e.g. small stock farmers.

Coastal & Environmental Services
Industrial development
Incompatible activities such as the proposed Coega Industrial Development Zone,
holds major biophysical constraints e.g.. electricity line through the park, water
extraction, pollution risk to islands, air pollution, consumptive use of resources and
visual impacts.
Alien species
Inappropriate game on game farms and alien fish species are major constraints to
achieving the goals of gAENP to protect indigenous processes and patterns.
4.7 CONSERVATION PLANNING OUTPUTS
The conservation planning process through the C-Plan conservation tool identifies
the most optimum selection of units (in this case cadastral areas) for biodiversity
conservation. Yet the challenge remains to optimally exploit the ecotourism
opportunities of these biologically important areas in synergy with the conservation
planning exercise. Providing sufficient opportunities for eco-tourism is essential for
the gAENP as income from eco-tourism will contribute greatly to it being financially
self-sustainable. Enhancing eco-tourism opportunities will also allow for sufficient
economic spin-offs for the surrounding communities.
Results from the various biophysical specialist studies (Specialist reports 1-3) were
used to feed a conservation planning process (C-Plan). The C-Plan provides
expansion opportunities based on biological importance, limitations and vulnerability.
It identifies different options for conservation that will meet the biological targets
based on irreplaceability14. Figure 4.7b gives a conceptual representation of the
priority areas as determined by the C-Plan analysis. It does not give exact
boundaries of the proposed expansion areas. Further information is provided in
Specialist Report 1. Of critical importance is the fact that the C-Plan conservation
tool reassesses conservation options with every incorporation of a land unit into the
park, thus making the conservation planning exercise a dynamic process.
The criteria applied in determining the size and shape of the proposed MPA were
assessed in Chapter 5 of Specialist Report 2. Based on present understanding of the
functioning of Algoa Bay, establishment of a MPA containing four essential spatial
elements is proposed. These are the Sundays River estuary, the surf-swept beaches
off the Alexandria dunefield, including the adjacent low reefs of the Black Bushes,
the Islands of the Cross, Bird Island group and the surrounding rocky reefs, and the
large expanse of soft-substrate in the centre of the bay with its spawning and nursery
areas overlain by the pelagial. For ease of policing, the MPA should consist of one
contiguous area and not be fragmented. The simplest shape that incorporates all
four spatial components is indicated in Figure 4.7a. The designs also incorporate the
need for coordinates of the MPA to be in vertical and horizontal lines (in terms of
longitude and latitude) for ease of policing.
14 Irreplaceability is a measure assigned to an area (water or land), which reflects the importance of that area, in
the context of the study region, for the achievement of the regional conservation targets.

Coastal & Environmental Services
Analysis of the patterns, process, targets and threat analyses via the C-Plan
exercise produced a map of irreplaceability for the gAENP planning domain (Figure
4.7a), and indicates that most of the planning domain was of conservation value.
However, to prevent speculation around specific land parcels that were highlighted
as being of importance in terms of the conservation of biodiversity patterns and
processes, broad areas were categorised based on the possible role that these
areas could play in the development of the greater Addo Elephant National Park
(Figure 4.7b).
It is important to note at the outset that all of the areas identified in the
accompanying diagram have been highlighted as being of critical importance to the
gAENP development in terms of meeting conservation targets set by the consultants
for the conservation of biodiversity patterns and processes. These areas have also
been selected as they are currently adjoining or in close proximity to the park. This
provides a logical framework to approach the development from in terms of
consolidation of existing statutory conservation areas. A brief description of each of
these areas follows, as well as that of the categories specified in the figure legend.
Important - high priority
Given the nature of the possible future threats as well as the biodiversity
components that these areas would conserve, a high priority rating for incorporation
into the park was allocated to these broad regions. The incorporation of these areas
could follow either direct acquisition initiatives by SANParks or the investigation of
contractual options.
Important - medium / low priority
These areas were identified as being of critical importance but the urgency in terms
of incorporation into the park is reduced. In these cases the possibility of including
these areas through some form of contractual arrangement may be the more
appropriate avenue to follow.
Contractual - high priority
These areas were identified in the conservation planning exercise as being critical to
the conservation of biodiversity in the region. Given the currently under-represented
nature of the land classes within this region, as well as the importance of the
Kabouga river system, the area receives a high priority status.
Contractual - medium priority
This category represents those areas that have been identified as being critical to
the conservation of additional thicket and bontveld habitat classes, while there are
also unique features associated with some of these areas. However, these areas are
not of an immediate priority for incorporation into the gAENP.
Area 1, West of Darlington Dam
This area is important for representation of land classes and mammals specific to the
xeric thicket areas of the gAENP. Witrug Spekboomveld and Ongegund Bontveld,
both high priorities for restoration, are represented, as well as some of the large
grassland tracts important for the persistence of natural fire processes. Many of the
arid-adapted plains' game would be found in this area, which in turn could support
future predator populations. Although SANParks has already entered into
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                  55



Coastal & Environmental Services
negotiations with landowners in the region in order to consolidate some of these
areas, specifically around the Darlington Dam, these should not be seen as the only
options available in the areas, and contractual agreements could also be pursued.
Area 2, Non-statutory reserve to the north of the Zuurberg/Kabouga region and
surrounds
This area protects under-represented land classes in the Nama Karoo group, and
several processes (upland-lowland interfaces, drought refuges, biome interfaces);
this area also protects portions of the Kabouga River (identified as the highest
priority in freshwater conservation in the gAENP). An extension of the conserved
land in this area would ensure the protection of both the source of the Kabouga River
and its confluence with the Sundays River. SANParks have already entered into
negotiations with an existing private landowner in the region to incorporate an
extensive private reserve into the AENP. Further negotiations are expected to take
place in the future in order to further consolidate the boundaries of these two areas.
Area 3, Ann's Villa region north of Zuurberg
Key to the global significance of.gAENP is its spatial heterogeneity - five biomes all
meeting in the area. This area is highlighted in the analyses for its habitat diversity,
linkages between upland and inland lowland biota, and biome interfaces between
xeric thicket, mesic thicket, grassland, fynbos and Nama Karoo and forest elements.
It represents a highly irreplaceable area in terms of ecological and evolutionary
processes, and needs to be conserved in terms of the gAENP conservation planning
goal. At present there are limited negotiations being undertaken by SANParks in this
region as the area was not previously thought to be of critical importance. A revision
of the priorities may therefore be required in order to investigate possible options
(contractual arrangements, direct land purchase) for the inclusion of this area into
the gAENP.
Area 4, Enon, Slagboom, Lower Zuurberg
This area lies to the northwest of the existing elephant camp of AENP, and would
extend the reserve through the southern section of the Zuurberg and into the Enon
Thicket (presently unconserved) and Addo Bontveld (highly transformed) areas
between the Coerney and Wit rivers. Although not of immediate priority, SANParks
has already entered into negotiations with some of the landowners in the region
(Riverbend) to incorporate some of this area into the AENP on a contractual basis.
Additional initiatives, which are being driven by the private sector, are also underway
to consolidate the remaining area for conservation.
Area 5, Schelmhoek Dunefield, Sundays River estuary
This area is loosely defined by the Sundays River mouth in the east and the
boundary of the planning domain in the west. It contributes to representation of two
mesic and xeric thicket types (Colchester Strandveld and Coerney Spekboomveld
respectively). This area is also important for mammal species that rely on thicket
habitats (bushbuck, bushpig), but plays little role in conservation of processes, other
than the western extreme of the Alexandria Dunefield. The Sundays River estuary
was identified as being of national and global significance in the marine conservation
planning exercise and the consolidation of this area would contribute to the linkage
of marine, coastal and inland biota.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                  56



Coastal & Environmental Services
Collaborative off-reserve management models should be investigated to ensure that
the biotic, hydrological and physical characteristics of the estuary are protected. Key
players will be SANParks, the Colchester and Sundays River communities, the
Sundays River Municipality, Pretoria Portland Cement (PPC) and the Department of
Water Affairs and Forestry. SANParks has already initiated negotiations with some of
the private landowners in the area to consolidated existing park boundaries while
contractual negotiations have been discussed with PPC to consider the inclusion of
the Schelmhoek dunefield.
Area 6, Kinkelbos, N2/R72 junction
This area lies between the existing Woody Cape Nature Reserve (which has recently
been transferred to SANParks) and AENP, to the east of the Sundays River estuary.
It provides one of the best options in the planning domain for securing contiguity
between coastal (southern) and inland (northern) biota. The area has received a
high priority status in terms of requirements for inclusion into the park and SANParks
will likely enter into negotiations with landowners to discuss possible options.
Area 7, Alexandria dunefield connections
This area is important for consolidating the existing conserved portions of the
Alexandria Dunefield and possibly even the Springmount Forest Reserve. The
dunefield needs to be conserved in its entirety in order to maintain the ecological and
evolutionary processes that it supports: linkage between the terrestrial and marine
environments, maintenance of sediment movement (e.g. erosion, stabilisation,
succession), inland movement of marine sands, maintenance of nutrient-rich
groundwater discharge and animal movement into and out of the dunefield.
A number of the land classes in the area (Zuney Bontveld, Congoskraal Bontveld)
and surrounding region are highly transformed and as a result highly vulnerable.
The prioritisation of this area for inclusion is therefore rated as high. Some level of
off-reserve management, including restoration, may need to be investigated if these
habitat types are to persist. SANParks has started negotiations with a number of the
landowners in the region regarding contractual arrangements, which SANParks feels
the correct way to proceed in this area.
Area 8, Alexandria north of R72
This area is dominated by dairy farming (ploughed pastures and cultivation) in a
matrix of grazing land. Management intervention is required in order to conserve
some of the last fragments of highly transformed Alexandria Bontveld and Olienhout
Bontveld (these land classes cannot be adequately conserved without restoration).
Given the nature of the current land use and options for consolidation with existing
statutory reserves, this area has been given a low priority rating although elements
within the landscape remain critical for conservation. Furthermore, most of this area
lies outside the designated planning domain.

5. THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT
5.1 INTRODUCTION
The Eastern Cape is the second largest of South Africa's nine provinces, with the
third largest population (6.7 million according to the 1996 census). It is growing at a
rate higher than the national average, with a large proportion of the population being
under the age of 15 years. Despite the size and potential of the province, it remains
the poorest partly due to historical and political reasons.
The Eastern Cape has a relatively high proportion of low paid workers and high
levels of poverty. The average Gross Geographic Product (GGP)15 per capita is less
than half that of the South African average. With approximately 710 000 poor
households in the province (4.1 million people), 57% of households and 64% of
individuals in the Eastern Cape live in poverty. Poverty is found particularly in the
rural areas and in the eastern half of the province.
5.2 THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT OF THE PLANNING DOMAIN
5.2.1 DEMOGRAPHICS
Information on the demographics (Table 5.2) of the planning domain was taken from
enumerator areas (EAs)l falling within the planning domain only, as collected in the
1996 census, with further information from the limited farm survey undertaken as
part of this project (Specialist Report 6). A weighted percentage was taken for those
EAs falling partially within the planning domain.
Table 5.2 shows that 64.5% of the' population in the planning domain are black and
Xhosa speaking, 24% have no schooling and 44% have some primary education
while only 39% of the working age of the population is employed. Poverty levels are
high with average wages being between R325 and R560 per month, slightly higher
wages being paid on dairy farms than on small stock farms. By comparison
SANParks labourers receive between RI 301 - R2 805 per month.
15 The GGP is a measure of the value of final goods and services produced within the geographic boundaries of
the region, calculated on an annual basis.
6 An EA is a pocket-sized piece of country that was visited by an enumerator during the census. Geographical
location and population density has an influence on the size of an EA, where an EA comprises approximately 100
households in sparsely populated areas and 200 households in densely populated areas.

5.2.2 LOCAL COMMUNITIES
The planning domain has an estimated population of 27 000 people, which includes
the towns, but the people directly affected by land purchases (i.e. farm workers and
their families) has been estimated to be 3 267 (Resettlement Policy Framework -
see Section 8.2). The local communities in the planning domain are typical of the
under-developed rural areas of South Africa. Both farmers and workers appear to
have a long history of residency on the parcel of land on which they currently reside
(on average, 33 years per farmer and 22 years per worker). Mean household size for
workers is 3.3 and for farmers 3.4. The majority of the planning domain has a very
low population density i.e. <1 person/ha (Figure 5.2) (Appendix 2). Higher population
densities are found in the areas around towns and in the intensive farming areas.
Settlements, Land Use, Tenure and Livelihood Sources
On commercial farms, farm labourers live mainly in settlements that occur in clusters
on demarcated sites. On dairy farms along the coast in the Alexandria area, these
clusters are larger than on stock farms inland. Studies have indicated that the
average dairy farm employs on average about 15 labourers (i.e. 1 per 50 ha) while
small stock pastoralism normally employs about half as many labourers on six times
as large a property (about 1 per 555 ha). Moreover, dairy farmers on average
appeared to have a further 1.5 farms under their management while the pastoral
farmers had marginally fewer, with on average 0.8 further farms. This indicates that
on average about 50% of the farms in the domain are unoccupied by the
landowners, which concurs with the fact that there has in fact been steady
depopulation of the rural areas over the last decade, and which would account for
the high formal urbanisation level of 89% for the Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage metrople.
About 25% of the 36 farms purchased by SANParks in the last five years were
occupied by the landowner, tenants or a labourer. Moreover, a preliminary estimate
put the number of labourers in this 40 000 ha area at less than 25 in total (i.e. 1
labourer per 1 600ha). A similar situation was found by one of the potential
contractual park owners who noted that only 2 (9%) of 23 farms purchased by them
were occupied by the landowner and that there was a total of 12 labourers employed
in the 16 000 ha (i.e 1 labourer per 1 333 ha). This labourer:area ratio is three times
lower than that initially estimated for the small stock farming areas. This indicates the
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                     59



Coastal & Environmental Services
general depopulation of the small stock farming areas within the domain where most
of the current SANParks expansion has taken place and into which the park is
planned to further expand as part of the gAENP project.
Most workers are well housed with brick houses but very few of them have
electricity. Many farm workers also have vegetable gardens. On some farms there
are facilities such as farm schools, soccer and rugby fields. The farm worker's land is
used mainly for residential purposes and as a livelihood source. About a third of the
farm workers have limited stock of their own on the farms, but all farm workers and
their families are tenants and have no property of their own.
Mainly male farm labourers receive wages and food rations, whilst the majority of
women depend on natural resources to supplement the household heads income.
Women farm dwellers and children are the most vulnerable social group, and
livelihood strategies are closely linked to the women's daily activities. Except in a few
cases such as on dairy farms, women farm dwellers do not have 'formal'
employment.
In terms of the Interim Protection of Informal Land Rights Act (109 of 1996) and other
legislation, tenants are protected when evicted without adequate provisions. The
Extension of Security of Tenure Act (62 of 1997) gives special rights to occupiers
who are 60 years or older and who have lived on the land for 10 years or longer.
Such people are called "long term occupiers". According to the Act, long term
occupiers can live on and use the land for the rest of their lives provided that they
always conduct themselves within an agreed legal framework. A large proportion of
the farm workers within the gAENP would be classified as long term occupiers.
Another issue related to long residency of farm workers on farmlands are that family
graves have been established. Graves play a very important role in the spiritual well-
being of many of the local people. Access to such sites within National Parks are
never denied.
Social Structure and Institutional Framework
Unlike in the rural areas of the former 'homelands' of South Africa, where male
absenteeism is high, most households have intact family units. The occupancy rate
in each household is 2-4 people. There are no organised local institutional structures
like tribal authorities or civic organisations. The Western District Municipality
provides social services such as clinics, social pensions, etc. Some farmers provide
services such as water and transport.
Skills
The bulk of the farm workforce is unskilled and barely literate (around 24% of
workers have no schooling) thereby reducing the chances of employment other than
manual labour. Dairy farms employ more farm workers per unit than the mixed farms
even though the dairy farms are smaller. The lack of skills amongst farm workers
perpetuates the cycle of poverty as their wages are linked to their skills. Although
unskilled, in general people on the farms regarded themselves as having less
mobility but more security, whilst regarding relatives in town as having more freedom
but less security.

Local Economic Development
Along with general productivity, the farm survey indicates that the profitability, land
value per hectare and number of workers per farm are substantially higher in the
coastal dairy farms than mixed stock farms further inland. This has implications for
the number of people affected and the value of land.
The mohair producers in the Somerset East, Jansenville and Uitenhage areas
produce at least one third of South Africa's wool production. The southeastern corner
of this region, within a 250km radius of Port Elizabeth, is an important bastion of
Angora goat farming. The loss of certain farming areas is likely to cause the
production of mohair to decline.
Cultural Environment
The proposed extent of the gAENP encompasses an area with significant heritage
resources. In 1996, a small dinosaur called Nqwebasaurus thwazi (Kirky) was
discovered near Kirkwood, while the very first dinosaur to be identified in South
Africa was discovered on the Bushmans River (on the edge of the Park) in 1845.
Archaeologically, the area includes extensive evidence of Khoisan settlement in the
past. This is reflected in the shell middens on the Alexandria coast, the rock art of
the Zuurberg and the stone cairns found along the Sundays River.
The proposed area of the gAENP also has many important historic connections.
Early travellers accounts provide information on the old wagon paths and the history
of early elephant (and game) hunting. The settlement of the region by Xhosa-
speakers and Europeans is reflected in the old farmhouses, mission stations,
cemeteries and villages. There are early frontier posts associated with the
successive Wars of Dispossession (Frontier Wars) and also some activity related to
the South African War (Anglo Boer War).
5.3 WHAT ARE THE MAJOR ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN THE
EASTERN CAPE AND PLANNING DOMAIN?
Economic activities were assessed at the provincial and district levels for the Eastern
Cape Province since economic data is more readily available at this level than at the
planning domain level. The proposed gAENP exists within the context of higher
planning levels, thus this data was used to determine economic activities and
indicators at the project domain level.
5.3.1 ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN THE EASTERN CAPE
Economic Indicators
The economic performance of a region is usually measured by its Gross Geographic
Product (GGP)17, and in particular, the annual growth in GGP. At R19 574m, the
Eastern Cape had the 5th highest GGP in 1991, but the average annual growth in
GGP from 1991 to 1996 was 1.5%, less than the total average for South Africa.
The Tress Index is used to measure the sectoral composition of economic activity in
a region, which indicates the level of diversification of the economy. A Tress index of
17 The GGP is a measure of the value of final goods and services produced within the geographic boundaries of
the region, calculated on an annual basis.

Coastal & Environmental Services
53.9 was calculated for the Eastern Cape, being the highest in South Africa and
substantially higher than the national average of 39.3. This high Tress Index
indicates a dependency on a few economic activities, namely manufacturing
(25.8%), commerce (16.3%) and services (27.3%). This more concentrated economy
is vulnerable to external variables such as adverse climatic conditions and
commodity price fluctuations.
At 0.603, the Human Development Index18 (HDI) of the Eastern Cape is lower than
the country as a whole (0.672). The HDI for certain population groups in the rural
districts is comparable to the worst in the world.
Economic Sectors
The country's economic sectors fall into nine categories, namely agriculture
(including hunting, forestry and fishing), mining, manufacturing, energy and water,
construction, commerce and accommodation, transport and communication, finance
and real estate, and services. Unfortunately the tourism industry is not a defined
sector, and economic benefits are hidden in the commerce and agricultural sectors.
This makes the contribution of tourism industries to national GDP and provincial
GGP difficult to quantify. Furthermore provincial information is largely lacking for
recent years.
The tourism industry is expected to be a major growth industry in the province. The
Eastern Cape has diverse attractions, with more than 800 kilometres of beaches, big
game fishing, mountains, hunting and game reserves.
The economic sectors most important from an employment point of view in the
Eastern Cape are listed below. The percentage given in brackets indicates the
percentage of people employed per sector - only the most important sectors,
however, are indicated below.
Services (29.8%)
Services include community, social and personal services. Employment for this
sector is largely by the government.
Manufacturing (18.1%)
The most important industry in the manufacturing sector is the motor industry, based
mainly in Port Elizabeth/Uitenhage and East London. The second largest
manufacturing sub-sector is the textiles, clothing and leather industry.
Commerce and Accommodation (15.7%)
These sectors are considered to be particularly important in the non-metropolitan
local economies and rural areas, and comprise a significant component of the
tourism industry.
Agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing (13.2%)
The contribution of this sector to the provincial economy is relatively low. It does,
however, provide the basis for manufacturing industries, such as food processing,
18HDI is a composite, relative index, which quantifies the human development of a community, using
measurements such as life expectancy, literacy and income. The HDI uses a scale from 0 (minimum value) to 1
(maximum value).

Coastal & Environmental Services
textiles and clothing. It also provides one of the few opportunities for employment in
the impoverished rural areas.
The Eastern Cape is considered to be politically stable, and has a relatively low
crime rate in comparison with provinces such as Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the
Western Cape. Certain industry sectors have been identified as having certain
comparative advantages and investment potential in the Eastern Cape (these are not
ranked in order of importance):
* Fabricated automotive and other metal components anrd metal beneficiation
* Electronic appliances, machinery, hand tools
* Leather products, textiles, weaving, knitting, clothing manufacture
* Food processing, "innovative" foods, pharmaceutical and health products
* Timber furniture and paper
* Tourism and eco-tourism
In contrast to the emphasis on manufacturing and exports, there are few incentives
available for the development of the tourism industry. The budget for the 2001
financial year for the Eastern Cape allocated the largest proportion of the budget to
education, welfare and health, which together received 82.77% of the budget, with
tourism receiving a portion of the R248m (1.26%) allocated to Economic Affairs,
Environment and Tourism.
5.3.2 ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES IN THE PLANNING DOMAIN
The proposed planning domain of the gAENP falls within four municipal areas
namely Nelson Mandela Metropole, Sundays River Valley, Ndlambe and Blue Crane
Route (Figure 5.3). Three of these are largely rural, and the Nelson Mandela
Metropole is mainly urban. The closest towns to the gAENP are Jansenville,
Somerset East, Paterson, Kirkwood, Addo, Alexandria, Port Elizabeth and
Uitenhage.
Socio-Economic Indicators
Only 23% of the population is employed, with the agricultural sector being the most
important sector in rural areas in terms of labour (contributing 32%), and in providing
inputs to the manufacturing sector, in particular industries such as meat processing,
dairy products, fruit canning, bakery and confectionary. Absolute numbers of people
employed in the agricultural sector are comparable across all districts except the
Nelson Mandela Metropole (Table 5.3). The greatest contributor to the GGP in the
area is manufacturing.

Social Services is the second most important employer, with 13.63% of people
reliant on the government for employment. Private households also make a
significant contribution to employment, followed by trade, accommodation and
manufacturing (Table 5.3).

The Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Municipality is served by good transport and
communication links, with plans to upgrade the airport to international standards.
This is considered vital to grow the tourism industry. The Port Elizabeth harbour is a
major conduit for export products from the interior, such as vehicles, wool, mohair,
citrus fruit, vegetables, flowers and leather.
Although the contribution of tourism to the provincial GGP and in particular, to the
economy of the western districts is difficult to determine, it is estimated to be
important and one that is showing considerable growth as reflected throughout the
country.
The most important contributors to GGP in the planning domain are Alexandria (field
crops (R25m) and animal products (90m)), Kirkwood (horticultural crops (R38m)),
Port Elizabeth and Somerset East (animal products (R48m & R28m respectively))
and Uitenhage (animal products (R23m)). Although not reflected in the contribution
to GGP, in 1995 the AENP was estimated to generate about R300-400 million into
the national economy by tourists travelling to the park. The knock-on effect of this
industry is seen in the burgeoning of the bed & breakfast industry in the Addo area,
from 2 to 19 in a few years. Furthermore, the AENP and other eco-
tourism/conservation operations appear to employ twice the labour force at four
times the salary of comparable pastoral operations.

5.4 SUMMARY
The Eastern Cape population can thus be described as:
* Largely rural
. Young
*  Growing fairly fast
*  Having high levels of poverty
*  Having a relatively high proportion of low paid workers
•  Having a high rate of unemployment
Agriculture is the sector that dominates the economic environment in the planning
domain, which is occupied by approximately 27 000 people. Thus the majority of the
rural population are black farm workers. Most of the people living on farms in the
planning domain stated that they preferred living on farms to living in towns or cities
(Specialist Report 6) and on average have been resident on the farms for at least 20
years. There does appear to be a steady depopulation of the rural areas to the cities.
People are under-educated relative to the national average, with 24% of workers
having no schooling. Income levels for 86.9% of people are below R500 per month,
and the age profile indicates a large proportion of infants and children. Dependency
ratios are high (1 worker:3.34 dependants).
Much of the socio-economic data available for the gAENP planning domain is dated,
(1996) and should be updated when the results of the October 2001 census are
available.
5.5 WHAT OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS DOES THE
SOCIO-ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT PRESENT?

environment for the gAENP. These are described in more detail in section 5.5.1 and

Coastal & Environmental Services
5.5.1 OPPORTUNITIES
Population density
The planning domain is mainly in an area of low population density, which means
that the costs associated with resettlement and compensation will be low in
proportion to the overall costs of the gAENP. Furthermore, the park does not include
any large settlements.
Neighbouring communities
The existence of generally poor neighbouring communities allows SANParks to not
only fulfill international policies on People and Parks, but also its own social
responsibility policies, which have advanced over the last five to ten years. This
offers the opportunity for the proposed gAENP to potentially act as a model of how to
ensure mutually beneficial relationship between protected areas and neighbouring
communities and stakeholders.
Unstable agricultural sector
The dominance of an existing single and often unstable agricultural economic sector
provides an opportunity to diversify the rural areas thereby generating more
economic sectors. This varied source of income will enhance economic returns per
hectare through a more profitable land use, attract new additional investment into the
Eastern Cape and will contribute to the regional and national Forex and GDP.
Furthermore, the eco-tourism/conservation industry is a viable form of land use,
making better use of the province's natural resources in a sustainable manner.
Donor money
The high conservation potential of global significance of the planning domain will
attract considerable donor and foreign investment that has not been attracted into
the established agricultural sector to date. The weakening Rand provides a more
attractive opportunity for overseas investors to invest in the project, as well as
foreign tourists to visit.
Alleviating poverty
The gAENP will assist in alleviating poverty by enhancing the human skills
base/human capital, by providing training in various fields of expertise and providing
a wider range of job types and opportunities for the local people than currently exist.
Wildlife industry
The growth in wildlife-based industries has essentially "paved" the way for the idea of
the Eastern Cape providing a unique wildlife experience. There is also a demand for
the excess game that the gAENP will produce. Containing the Big 7, which includes
whales and great white shark, provides a unique marketing opportunity nationally
and internationally (combined with the area's malaria-free status).
Cross-subsidisation of game
Cross-subsidisation of game by SANParks will reduce the costs of stocking the area
with suitable game species. Similarly, financial cross-subsidisation within SANParks
helps develop parks with money generated elsewhere in the national parks system.

Coastal & Environmental Services
5.5.2 OPTIMISING OPPORTUNITIES
Land reform grants (SLAGs)
The use of land reform grants (SLAGs) provides an opportunity for the gAENP to
enable displaced farm workers to continue in other skills development and business
programmes, or possibly continue to farm, but on alternative land. It may also be a
mechanism by which the costs to the gAENP of resettlement are reduced. They can
optimise this by using their institutional capacity to negotiate on behalf of resettled
farm workers en masse, rather than on a farm-by-farm basis.
Eco-tourism
The gAENP must provide additional and diverse eco-tourism experiences and
infrastructure (Specialist Report 11 and section 9.4). It is estimated that this will
generate additional annual income of approximately R28 million for the park alone
(Specialist Report 13). Knock-on effects of the tourism industry in the area around
Addo will be generated (i.e. bed & breakfasts, tourist lodges on adjacent contractual
park land (see section 9.2) and craft sales would increase substantially).
As mentioned in Section 4.6, the opportunities presented by the biophysical
environment for the creation of a vast array of eco-tourism experiences is unique.
Economic sectors
The gAENP must span diverse economic sectors and provide employment as well
as varied sources of income. In addition, human skills would be enhanced, training in
various fields provided or facilitated and a wider variety of job types and
opportunities created. Moreover, the protected area would attract additional
investment (foreign and local) of a sustainable nature. Thus the dominance of any
existing single unstable agricultural economic sector (or the creation of another)
would be avoided.
Poverty alleviation
Government assistance in poverty alleviation would be available for a number of
activities, such as project infrastructure creation and maintenance. The Working for
Water and Poverty Relief programmes alone have provided collectively about
R3.2 million in labour intensive projects within the park. The existence of the AENP
and its proposed expansion plans were some of the prime reasons behind the
successful awarding of the grants, which are planned to control the expansion of
alien biota and other conservation aiding projects such as fence construction, road
maintenance, etc. Proximity to large towns through accessible transport would also
generate opportunities for environmental education and sustainable development.
Neighbouring communities
Neighbouring communities must benefit not only from the economic spin-offs from
ecotourism, but possibly also from natural resources in the park. Consumptive
utilisation is, however, a highly contentious subject and SANParks will need to
investigate this further.

Coastal & Environmental Services
5.5.3 CONSTRAINTS
Resettlement
The high rate of security that workers experience on farms - reasonable housing,
rations in addition to wages, grazing for stock, dwelling rights and security until or
unless the farm is sold, is a major constraint facing the proposed gAENP as these
people would need to be resettled or otherwise employed. For many of them
resettlement would be involuntary. A large number of off-farm dependants would
also be affected.
General concerns
Concerns amongst the affected stakeholders include: opposition from strong
commercial and recreational fishing interests to limitations or bans on access and
catches in the proposed marine area; uncertainties amongst farmers and farm
workers on the boundary of the park; and uncertainties about land tenure. The
limited capacity of the current social ecology unit at AENP is a constraint, in that it is
not intimately involved in communication and resettlement issues for the broader
gAENP.
Negative perceptions
Prior to the SEA, with its extensive Public Participation Process, expansion initiatives
occurred in the absence of a well-executed communication strategy and meaningful
interaction with stakeholders, outside of the Addo Planning Forum. This resulted in
negative perceptions of the gAENP in certain sectors.
Land claims
Three land claims have been identified in the planning domain.
Establishment costs
The development costs of gAENP will be high e.g. fencing costs, purchasing of
game and land. Land purchases remain the single highest cost and this is largely
dependent upon loans and government and donor support. Rising land prices as a
result of speculation remains a constraint.
Equitable benefits
The majority of the domestic Eastern Cape market is poor so they cannot gain any
benefit from gAENP, which will limit the number of local people visiting the park, and
the park could thus be seen as not being beneficial to the majority of the people of
the Eastern Cape.
Limited economic opportunities
Some areas of the proposed gAENP are ecological sensitive, e.g. islands, which
limits economic opportunities, as the number of tourists to the islands would be
limited.
5.5.4 MEASURES TO MITIGATE CONSTRAINTS
Resettlement Policy Framework
SANParks does not have a legal requirement to ensure that workers on land through
a purchased willing seller - willing buyer contract are adequately resettled and/or
compensated, this being the seller's obligation as part of ESTA (Extension of
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                  69



Coastal & Environmental Services
Security and Tenure Act). SANParks, however, feels that it has a moral obligation
and a responsibility to World Bank Operational Policy 4.12. Therefore, SANParks
commissioned a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) including Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs), which was completed in October 2002. The RPF and RAPs
can be viewed on the greater Addo Elephant National Park webpage,
www.addoelephantpark.com.
Land purchasing up to now has focused on consolidating park boundaries, perceived
areas of biological importance, and planned business areas. It was recommended to
SANParks that all purchasing of land should be frozen until the gAENP SEA process
had been completed or until a resettlement plan has been developed. However,
halting land purchases is not possible as land, especially in the Zuurberg area,
where funding has been made available for land purchases, is available.
Furthermore, the availability of Working for Water and Poverty Relief funding was
seen as a form of bridging financing for affected farm labourers until such time as the
comprehensive Resettlement Policy Framework was completed (end of October
2002; See Terms of Reference included in Appendix 1). Further interim measures,
as recommended by the Department of Land Affairs (DLA), are that all purchases
being presently undertaken or negotiated will include discussions with farm
labourers, in conjunction with the DLA. Discussion should include employment
opportunities to be presented by the gAENP programme, e.g. preference being given
to displaced labourers in the upcoming Poverty Relief and Working for Water
programmes.
Communication strategy
SANParks has accepted the need to develop communication strategies. This will
require an appropriate budget, a professional communication and marketing team,
and an increase in the numbers of staff for the social ecology section of SANParks.
A Public Relations and Communication Strategy has been designed and
implemented. The communication strategy will assist in communications regarding
many negative perceptions the public have regarding the proposed gAENP,
employment opportunities that will be available, management options that will be
explored and investigated, and will also include conflict resolution strategies.
Neighbour issues
A number of neighbour issues will also be dealt with via the communication channel
e.g. closing/restriction of fishing grounds, should the proposed MPA be approved.
SANParks will also need to maintain fencing on areas surrounded by farms;
investigate forms of incentives or benefits for conservation orientated land use by
adjoining private landowners; consider compensation, where applicable, for losses
due to problem animals; devise mutual strategies to limit poaching and improve
security as well as to prevent invasion of the land by illegal persons and promote
marketing of farm-based tourism and accommodation within the broader gAENP, to
encourage good relations with neighbours.
An array of potential initiatives exist with regard to previously disadvantaged
communities/informal settlements within and around the planning domain. For
example, promoting development in townships/settlements through arts and crafts;
preferential employment of locals (after suitable training if required); introducing local

Coastal & Environmental Services
children to the gAENP in terms of environmental education; conservation outreach
programmes within the communities themselves and linkages with teachers in local
schools. These examples indicate some possible initiatives but it is necessary that
gAENP Social Ecology devises and implements a comprehensive and holistic plan to
engage residents of township and informal areas.
Careful physical planning and constructive engagement with the Coega
Development Corporation can mitigate the constraint that the proposed development
of the Industrial Development Zone at Coega poses on planning for tourism and
optimum land use of gAENP. It will, however, remain a significant constraint.
The Social Monitoring Programme (Specialist Report 8) identified three categories of
stakeholders requiring different communication strategies, as well as goals,
objectives, indicators and measurements for the monitoring process.
Establishment costs
The project will require funding to shift it from the current status quo to a larger area
of 156 000 ha, incorporating the biodiversity goals set for the project. It is estimated
that this will cost approximately R270 million. This will be required for the following
functions:
* re-introduce approximately R50 million in game to stock to 50% of the long term
desired carrying capacity;
. a further R120 million for land purchase and infrastructure including roads,
fencing, buildings, rehabilitation, planning, legal fees etc;
* approximately R100 million in tourism infrastructure, of which R65 million will be
supplied by the private sector.
Most of the game will be sourced from SANParks' existing game stocks so this
cannot be seen as a direct cost. At least 65% of the tourism infrastructure will be
financed by the private sector at their risk. The R120 million required for
developments (e.g. fencing, roads, training programmes, rehabilitation, planning, etc)
will be funded from various sources, with at least 50% from donor finance with no
further financial obligations. The remainder will be funded from various sources
within Government, including the Working for Water Programme, Poverty Relief
Programme and SANParks Development Fund. A small proportion will be financed
from loans between SANParks and financing institutions.
It is predicted that the park will be able to operate independently of external funding
once operational, if the capital costs are written off. Income should more than cover
the projected running expenditure. Under this framework, the return on additional or
new SANParks investment will be about 6 to 7%.
The land incorporation strategy will in most instances provide neighbouring
landowners who share a common boundary with the gAENP an opportunity to
incorporate their land into the park under a mutually agreeable arrangement. This
will diversify and increase the economic opportunities available to these landowners,
as well as diversify the tourism product. For those landowners who are adjacent to
Big 5 areas, it is likely that land values will increase (almost double) as has
happened elsewhere in the country (Mpumalanga, North West and Northern
Provinces) when land has been incorporated into Big 5 areas.

Initial indications suggest that for many landowners, except those on high potential
land (arable or dairy), the net farm income from Big 5 areas is likely to exceed that of
their current operations.
Employment options
It is estimated that the project will generate approximately 360 direct full time jobs in
the tourism sector as well as about 150 in the conservation sector. This excludes at
least 300 per annum in the development phase, but these will be of a temporary
nature. These would be for example in the Poverty Relief and Working for Water
Programmes as well as construction related development projects. Furthermore, the
knock-on effect of creating further jobs in the tourism sector will be substantial and
probably number in the thousands. It is planned to increase the number of tourists
from the present 110 000 to 180 000 per annum within six years, as well as increase
the number of nights spent in the park from the present one to a minimum of three. If
the AENP with 75 000 tourists in 1995 generated between R300-400 million in travel
costs alone, doubling the tourist numbers would substantially increase this input into
the national economy, which in turn would generate a considerable number of jobs in
associated and supportive industries.
Since the majority of the farm workers that will be displaced and thus eligible for
employment are unskilled, skills training programmes will be included as part of the
Resettlement Policy Framework.
Permanent employment opportunities in the gAENP will include:
. Tourism and managerial staff at accommodation and other tourist related
facilities
* Tourist related activities e.g. guided tours
Gate guards
* Game guards
* Fence and anti-poaching patrol teams
Maintenance of roads, fences, waterholes etc
Employees at the cultural and environmental education centre
Game-capture assistants
* Support industries (retail)
Temporary employment opportunities will include:
* Fencing (removing old fences and erecting new fences)
• Construction related employment
Installing additional infrastructure in the park e.g. waterholes and gates
* Alien vegetation clearing
SANParks is also committed to black economic empowerment (BEE), job creation
and community development. This project will have a framework in place to ensure
that these imperatives are addressed and implemented.

6. THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE gAENP
Financial pressures resulting from a reduction in government subsidy has resulted in
SANParks placing greater focus on business efficiency within parks. Each park has
become a "business unit", where they endeavour to fund their own operations and
become financially sustainable. The financial viability of the gAENP was assessed in
Specialist Report 10.
6.1 IS THE PROPOSED GAENP FINANCIALLY VIABLE?
Results of Specialist Report 10 have shown that the Total Gross Income (TGI) from
small-stock pastoralism (a land use covering approximately 60% of the planning
domain), is estimated to be about R80/ha in comparison to the R103/ha from game
farming (not including income from eco-tourism). These figures were calculated
using an area of approximately 135 OOOha of similar vegetation type and grazing
carrying capacities. Areas under intensive dairy farming are estimated to have a TGI
of about R177/ha, against which conservation would struggle to compete on purely
financial grounds, yet provides unmeasurable ecological services19 not provided by
the cleared agricultural land.
The TGI for game farming does not take into account any income from eco-tourism,
but is dependent on significant revenues from game sales. The above figures also
take into account the fact that most of the pastoralism activities are established.
Establishment costs for the gAENP are vast, and in order to determine the financial
viability of the proposed park, financial requirements to make the park a viable option
have been explored. These costs are projected over a 5 to 6-year time frame, which
is necessary to develop the park in manageable units. These have been covered in
detail in Specialist Reports 11 - 13, and a summary of the financial implications are
presented below.
Many of the proposed tourist activities will be possible with minimal further capital
input into the project by SANParks (±R20 million), excluding the land acquisition.
However the Big 5 tourism areas will require significant investment if the full range of
opportunities are to be exploited (±R168 million, including game).
6.1.1 LAND
Some of land identified for incorporation into the gAENP has already been
purchased or is in the process of being purchased. It is estimated that land
purchases to consolidate a core area from which the broader goals set out in C-Plan
can be achieved, will cost around R56 million. To fully achieve the objectives of C-
Plan more land will need to be incorporated, but this will most likely be achieved
through either willing seller-willing buyer transactions or through incorporation of
private land into the reserve on a contractual scheme.
19 Services provided by the environment e.g. decrease in harmful greenhouse gasses, clean water production,
protection of biodiversity etc.

6.1.2 INFRASTRUCTURE
Once the land has been acquired by SANParks it will need to be developed to meet
the goals and objectives of the reserve and its different components. One of the
largest capital costs is fencing. This has initially been divided into different units until
game numbers have increased and land consolidated. The initial fencing is
estimated to cost approximately R25 million and will largely be funded through
Poverty Relief funding and GEF support. This includes the cost of upgrading all
areas north of the N2 to Big 5 standards. Initially the area on the coast will be
excluded but the long term vision is to have a portion of this area included if the
greater conservation goals are to be met. The cost also includes the expenses
associated with removal of existing fence material.
6.1.3 ROADS
The park has been zoned for different tourism uses. This has been done mainly to
reduce the capital requirements of road construction and maintenance. Roads and
tracks can be very costly, especially if provision has to be made for access to normal
sedan type vehicles. The plan takes these considerations into account and certain
areas will have limited access. The total road development costs are estimated to be
about R25 million. These are mostly gravel roads and include a total distance of just
under 1 000km, at an average cost of about R25 000 per km. Here again, private
concessionaires, Poverty Relief funding, and GEF support will absorb associated
costs.
6.1.4 BUILDING AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE
Conservation infrastructure such as staff accommodation, entrance gates, offices,
workshops etc. have been estimated to cost about 7.1 million. These will be spread
over most of the park and will make use of existing structures where possible.
However, large headquarters are planned for the current office complex at the
existing Addo Camp and a large section of this funding will come from Poverty Relief
and GEF.
6.1.5 EQUIPMENT
Additional equipment will be required over and above the existing assets. An
amount of almost R2 million has been estimated for this. This figure is low and it
indicates that the level of management in many areas will be very low. Plans are to
access GEF funding for this aspect.
6.1.6 GAME
The introduction of game forms one of the largest cost components of the entire park
development. Although there is existing game in the current AENP, this is insufficient
to achieve the long to medium term stocking goals. Detailed stocking models have
been developed and it is suggested that each area be stocked to 50% of its long
term stocking rate. This will provide a good population base on which the game can
reproduce and build up to their final numbers within 5 to 10 years. The total cost of
game is estimated to be almost R51 million. Buffalo account for a large portion of this
because of their high market value.

6.1.7 OPERATING COSTS
The reserve will obviously require a budget for carrying out the annual operations.
This is expected to grow from its current base to a final figure of just over R12 million
by year 6. This includes all the conservation related expenses including staff salaries
and other operational items.
6.1.8 CONCLUSION
As projections in Table 6.1 indicate, the proposed gAENP would have a positive
income as of year 6 and earn on average about Rl 57/ha, greater than the alternative
agriculture total gross margin of R1 20/ha.
6.2 WHAT INCOME CAN BE EXPECTED FROM THE PARK?
6.2.1 INCOME
Income is derived from several sources, including entrance fees (split tariff for
foreign and South African citizens/residents), game sales, revenue from tourism
operations, inclusive of concessionaires/contractual parks. Entrance fees are
estimated to reach about R1.5 million by year 6 and visitor numbers to reach about
180 000 per annum. Game sales will generate approximately R14 million. These
projections have been made on current prices and because of this, buffalo account
for almost 80% of this income. The likelihood of buffalo maintaining their current
market value is difficult to predict and the impact of price changes to buffalo must be
borne in mind when making income projections for game. The likely moratorium on
buffalo movements other than Addo buffalo will see the price of this group of animals
escalate.
The remaining income of just over R9 million is earned from tourism. This is not the
turnover but the expected return to SANParks. This is generated from several
different tourism operations and these are dealt with below (Figure 6.2).
Addo
The Addo section, which extends from the N2 to the Paterson road will continue with
the present SANParks controlled camp, the privately operated Gorah elephant camp
(already operational), plus a further similar Gorah-type development and a new
SANParks camp accommodating about 50 guests. These are estimated to earn just
over R4 million for SANParks per year.
Nyati
This is an area north of the current Addo Camp and east of the Zuurberg road. An
existing concession has been awarded in this area and a further two are planned,
with negotiations with one already well advanced. This entire area will accommodate
84 beds and will focus on the conducted drives with no self-drive areas. Fees are
likely to be higher than the current Addo camps.
Kabouga
This area will focus on the Kabouga-Sundays River area in the Zuurberg Mountains
and extends. Activities and developments in this area will include a higher income
camp of about 60 beds, probably on the Sundays River. In addition, a hiking trail in
the mountains accommodating about 18 guests and a 4x4 trail mostly on existing

tracks and using existing facilities. The income to SANParks from these areas is
estimated at Rl million per year.

Darlington Dam
This area focuses on the Karoo plain around Darlington Dam. Here another
SANParks camp is proposed similar to the one at Addo but only accommodating
about 75 guests. In addition a campsite for about 10 sites will be developed and a
private opportunity similar to Gorah will be made available to the private sector
comprising about 24 beds. The total income is expected to be about R1.2 million per
annum.
Woody Cape
Woody Cape is the area to the south of the N2 and includes the coastal strip from
Sundays River to the existing Woody Cape Reserve. Here the existing trails network
will be extended to cater for about 26 visitors. A private camp opportunity will be
made available for a 24-bed camp, probably with access to the Addo section and a
campsite near the Sundays River with beach access to be developed by SANParks.
All these are expected to generate just over RI million for SANParks per annum.
Summary
For the above plans to work, additional capital funding of about R170 million will be
required. The projected income will more than cover the operational costs of this
development, even if the price of buffalo falls substantially. Very few conservation
areas in South Africa generate sufficient income to cover their operational costs.
However, the economic benefits from job creation (over 500 directly from the
operations) and other benefits such as biodiversity conservation and ecological
services (clean water, carbon sinks etc.) do yield huge benefits. The spin-off effects
in the area are potentially high as it gives landowners another option for their land
beyond normal agriculture. If the project does attract the tourist numbers expected, a
larger region will benefit significantly.
6.3 WHAT IS THE TOURISM POTENTIAL?
Since tourism will be the main source of income for the gAENP, the existing tourism
and the tourism potential of the planning domain were investigated (specialist reports
12 and 15) and are summarised below.
6.3.1 ESTABLISHED ECO-TOURISM IN THE PLANNING DOMAIN
An overview of the tourism industry in the planning domain is difficult, as
comprehensive marketing surveys have not been carried out. The East Cape
Tourism Board (ECTB) is in the process of gathering data on tourist numbers, which
will be available after the 2001/2002 summer season. The Eastern Cape has diverse
attractions for tourism potential - the beaches, big game fishing, mountains, game
reserves and hunting - but its share of the travel and tourism GDP is merely 8.2%,
compared with 36.3% for KwaZulu-Natal, and 21.5% for the Western Cape. The
potential for growth is therefore considerable. If the Eastern Cape is to increase its
share of the national target market to 13%, this would lead to 65 000 more job
opportunities - equivalent to the total presently employed in agriculture. The
province is extremely well placed to synergise and benefit from tourists to other
areas, e.g. the Western Cape generally and the Garden Route in particular. The
gAENP has the capacity to capitalise on its link to the Garden Route and generate
overall tourism in the region as described below.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                 79



Coastal & Environmental Services
Although nationally there appears to be a decline in tourism numbers, those to the
AENP have steadily increased. SANParks have only recently begun to carry out
market research and preliminary results show that there is potential to expand the
tourist market to the park by increasing the variety of wildlife experiences, improving
quality, diversity and efficiency of facilities and providing more background
information on the area.
Addo Elephant National Park (AENP)
The AENP remains the cornerstone of tourism in the Addo area, and currently
employs 39 tourism staff members to run the tourism product in the present 11 000
ha elephant section.
Tourism expansion plans as described in Section 6.2, within the proposed gAENP
include adventure and outdoor activities such as game viewing, bird watching,
guided night drives, horse trails, nature trails, overnight hikes and a 4x4 trail. The
shop and the restaurant have been outsourced to private enterprise. At this stage,
the expansion in tourism is uncertain and it is not clear how this will affect staff
needs.
Inclusion of Woody Cape into the gAENP will expand tourism options in this section
of the park by building on the present hiking trail and 4x4 access to the beach, which
will be restricted in line with new legislation. The combination of forest and extensive
dunefield, beaches, and off-shore islands offer a wide range of unique experiences
to visitors.
SANParks has initiated a national concession drive in their parks, with two having
been awarded in the park. Three to four additional concession opportunities and
possible nodes for tourism are still to be identified. They are expected to offer better
tourism opportunities and survive, with greater returns for SANParks.
Privately owned Game and Nature Reserves
* Shamwari Game Reserve, situated along the Bushmans River, is well marketed
and offers an upmarket tourism product. It is currently the southern most reserve
in Africa that offers the Big 5. Day visits, overnight accommodation and other
African experiences are presented. Shamwari also has an education centre and
an African Arts and Culture Centre.
. Schotia Game Reserve borders the AENP and offers a wildlife experience
complete with "free-ranging" lions. Overnight accommodation is available as well
as a dinner experience in an open-air lapa.
* Burchell Game Reserve is situated in the New Year valley near Alicedale. It
offers a conference venue and a thatched lodge.
* Leopard's Kloof is situated in the Alexandria forest and dunefields and mainly
offers outdoor activities such as hiking and deep-sea cruises.
* Several new enterprises are starting to market themselves as exclusive game
lodges offering a range of eco-tourism activities.
Hunting enterprises
The Eastern Cape is a preferred destination for foreign trophy hunters. There are
500 game farms in the province, more than double the number a decade ago. Game
auctions already generate substantial revenue. The gAENP would enhance eco-

Coastal & Environmental Services
tourism greatly and enable rural people to generate revenue in both core and
peripheral developments.
Coastal tourism
The coastline stretching from Port Elizabeth to the area proposed to be incorporated
within the gAENP is relatively under-utilised as most is inaccessible. Tourism PE
promotes the Port Elizabeth beachfront.
Cannon Rocks holiday resort, with camping chalets and self-catering flats, is situated
135km east of Port Elizabeth. It offers access to the beach, surfing, fishing, a
swimming pool and a walking trail.
Accommodation
Approximately 19 B&Bs occur in the Addo area, many of which are on citrus farms
and more recently at Colchester. Of the most popular hotels in the area, the
Zuurberg Inn, River Bend Country Lodge and Sandflats Hotel offer unique tourist
experiences.
Crafts and curios
Four outlets selling crafts and curios occur within the Addo area and several in the
Alexandria area. Three of the outlets in the Addo area expressed an interest in
selling more locally produced products.
Tour operators
A number of tour operators, varying from small entrepreneurs to well-established
companies operating nationally, occur in the area. Many have bases in Port
Elizabeth and all offer unique tours around the Eastern Cape, ranging from wildlife
tours, to township tours.
Suppliers
Suppliers to the tourism industry include manufacturers of food, beverages, crafts
and curios and services. There is a long term relationship with many of the suppliers.
The criteria for ordering from suppliers are price, quality, convenience and reliability
of supply, with no environmental or social criteria being considered yet. SANParks
have a policy stating that a certain percentage of supplied goods should be from
disadvantaged suppliers. Using local suppliers, however, is difficult as an ongoing
and often urgent supply needs to be guaranteed.
Tourism PE is conceptualising a Tourism Supply Chain project, which will entail
persuading tourism businesses to source 20% of all their supplies from new supply
chains, i.e. from disadvantaged communities. The aim is to unleash a major job
creation burst from tourism, in ways that are easily attainable for new businesses.
However, businesses will need incentives, such as rates rebates, and new
entrepreneurs will require training (technical, management, marketing, etc.).
Adventure tourism operators
This sector of the tourism market is increasing in the Eastern Cape region. Seven
companies in the region offer a variety of adventure-based activities e.g. bungee
jumping, blackwater tubing, 4x4 trails, horse trails, microlight flights, abseiling and
ballooning.

Coastal & Environmental Services
Farm tourism
Several B&Bs in the Sundays River valley are located on private farms, but do not
necessarily promote farm tourism as a product. Many offer horse trails, including
Happy Lands (Kirkwood) and Springmount Trails, which offer horse trails on a dairy
farm, with access to the dunes and beach. In addition, they offer a guided ride by ox-
wagon.
Agricultural / Horticultural tourism
Despite the predominantly agricultural nature of the land use in the Kirkwood and
Alexandria districts, few such activities aimed at tourists were identified, apart from
the Rose Show (Addo) and Chicory Plant tours (Alexandria).
Sport tourism
Watersports and other sport tourism activities are confined to Port Elizabeth, with
polo on offer at the active Addo Polo Club.
6.3.2 THE ECONOMICS AND SUSTAINABILITY OF ECO-TOURISM/
CONSERVATION AS A FORM OF LAND USE
There is an emerging demand for sustainability of all forms of natural resource use,
in order to provide for quality of life for current and future generations. This has been
expressed in a host of policy documents and internationally, including the Rio
Declaration (June 1992) and more explicitly in the Convention for the Conservation
of Biodiversity. Within South Africa, sustainability was stated to be one of the keys of
the Reconstruction and Development Programme (African National Congress 1994)
and features prominently in the White Paper on "An environmental policy for South
Africa". However, the implementation of sustainable forms of land use has proved
elusive, largely due to a lack of understanding of the implications of the various
forms of land use.
Although eco-tourism/conservation is recognised as a valid form of land use and a
lucrative alternative to conventional agriculture and pastoralism, this category of land
use is generally ignored in economic analyses. There have also been few attempts
to quantify the value of eco-tourism/conservation in either financial or economic
terms (Antrobus, Fraser, Levin & Lloyd 1994).
In a financial analysis, Kerley et al. (1995) clearly showed that eco-tourism/
conservation in Valley Thicket (AENP), besides being sustainable, also generated
more income than a comparable pastoral operation and was generally profitable. In
addition, the eco-tourism/conservation option is ecologically sustainable.
There are also indications that fynbos cannot sustain conventional agriculture or
pastoralism, but that eco-tourism, water catchment and flower harvesting are
sustainable forms of land use in this biome (Rebelo 1996). Similarly, forests cannot
sustain pastoralism (Castley & Kerley 1996b), and are destroyed by clearing for
crops. The highly threatened nature and extent of degradation of the Nama Karoo
and certain grassland types suggest also that the current forms of land use need to
be reappraised in terms of their sustainability in these biomes. It may therefore be
concluded that eco-tourism/conservation is an ecologically sustainable, and
therefore highly desirable form of land use.

Coastal & Environmental Services
Eco-tourism, if carefully planned (uses for specific areas), is a sustainable form of
use of the natural environment and can be a long term economic generator without
being detrimental to biodiversity conservation. The types of suitable eco-tourism
activities and the areas in which they are suitable are discussed in detail in Specialist
Report 11 and are summarised here.
The economic perspective shows a far higher value for eco-tourism/conservation
derived from the AENP, with visitors spending a conservatively estimated
R360 million travelling (flights, car hire, fuel, hotels, etc.) to the park in 1996 (Geach
1997). This figure does not include what the visitors spent in the park for
accommodation, meals, supplies, game drives, tips, etc. The total Gross Geographic
Product of the districts in which the proposed gAENP will fall (Alexandria, Kirkwood,
Somerset East and Jansenville) was lower (R297 million in 1992, no data available
for 1996) than the amount spent by visitors travelling to the AENP in 1996 (Geach
1997), although it must be recognised that the tourist figure is distributed over a far
wider area (Geach 1995, 1997). Thus eco-tourism/conservation can clearly be seen
to be a major economic role player in the Eastern Cape.
In terms of employment opportunities, eco-tourism/conservation also performs well,
with the current AENP employing twice as many people at four times the income of a
comparable pastoralism operation (Kerley et al. 1995). Furthermore, onsite
employment figures seriously under-estimate the employment opportunities provided
by eco-tourism/conservation as a form of land use, as tour operators, service
providers and other ripple effects also generate jobs. It has been estimated that each
10 foreign tourists will create one local job (Hugo 1992). This suggests that with
114 000 visitors in 2001, half of which are foreign, the AENP generates about 6 000
direct and indirect employment opportunities.
Thus, eco-tourism/conservation is clearly highly desirable in terms of wealth
generation and job creation. The proposed gAENP will therefore have the potential
to significantly expand the contribution of eco-tourism/conservation to the regional
economy. However, it is not possible to simply extrapolate the economic contribution
of the current AENP to the proposed extended park, as the value of the larger park
will depend on a host of factors. These include the nature of eco-tourism
developments (currently restricted to the current AENP) and the size of the eco-
tourism market.
Furthermore, eco-tourism can offer greater scope for unskilled labourers to develop
new skills and thus to be exposed to a wider variety of employment opportunities
than agriculture would offer.
6.4 WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS
PRESENTED BY TOURISM?
Table 6.4 lists the opportunities and constraints presented by the existing and
potential tourism opportunities of the planning domain for gAENP. These are
described in more detail in sections 6.4.1 and 6.4.2.

6.4.1 OPPORTUNITIES
Existing tourism market
The existing AENP (11% of the proposed gAENP) is an established and well-known
destination, and attracted 114 000 tourists (over 50% from foreign countries) in 2001.
The number of tourists to the park has been increasing at a steady 8% per annum
since 1991 when only 51 000 tourists visited the park. Thus there is an existing
market that can be extended to the gAENP, thereby reaching financial sustainability
within a shorter period of time. The proximity to the Garden Route and other
international tourist destinations, and the presence of the unique marketing
opportunity of the Big 7 in a malaria-free country, will also help to draw tourists to the
gAENP, and therefore promote financial viability.
Eco-tourism opportunities
Government has recognised the importance of tourism in the Eastern Cape as a
potential economic contributor. Its target for GDP generation from tourism is 10%.
The Eastern Cape has the potential to develop specific eco-attractions, and the
province is a preferred destination for foreign hunting companies. The gAENP would
enhance eco-tourism greatly and enable rural people to generate revenue in both
core and peripheral developments. This 'multiplier' effect started with direct earnings
from tourism will stimulate the local economy, which could produce a significant
increase in the economy of the region. The eco-tourism industry will increase the
skills base of the work force, making them more marketable.
The advent of a tourism college at Port Alfred with an eco-tourism emphasis and
links to the private sector is an important new social opportunity for the gAENP, just
as the gAENP is for the college. The AENP and the gAENP can provide training and
research opportunities for staff and students in return for training that the college can
provide for AENP staff.
The gAENP has an outstanding range of desirable options for tourists because of the
habitat variability the area offers. These include:
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                        84



Coastal & Environmental Services
* Game viewing - Big 7 experience could include great white shark and whales.
* Walking and hiking - best suited to areas where vehicle access is limited, where
scenery and natural attractions are high and where there is no dangerous game.
* Diversity of scenery and habitats, plus inclusion of an adjacent MPA makes for a
unique conservation area.
* 4x4 tourism is best suited to areas where the costs of building normal roads are
too high e.g. rugged terrain.
* Open water activities and fishing are an option for the coastal areas, depending
on the category of Marine Reserve proposed. Fishing will also be permissible on
the Darlington Dam and the lower reaches of the Sundays River.
* Hunting is not permitted under the National Parks Act in a Schedule 1 National
Park, but should Schedule 2 areas be incorporated, hunting could be an option.
Revision of the NPA may see this being allowed in SANParks.
* Proximity to an international air and sea port.
When this range of attractions is put together as a package, the gAENP will be able
to attract visitors as a major destination in its own right, on an equal basis with the
Serengeti, Kruger and other great African experiences.
The climate of the Addo region is also very well suited for tourism, being generally
warm temperate, with cool winters and hot summers. Port Elizabeth was voted as
being one of the top ten cities in the world in terms of its climate (Anon. 1996). This
allows for year-round tourism opportunities, particularly exploiting the good
conditions here during the northern hemisphere winter.
Heritage attractions
Besides natural resources, the 'footprint' abounds in heritage attractions, yet to be
catalogued and developed.
Transport
The proximity to the metropole and infrastructure provides accessible transport
facilities, a high incidence of day-trippers and provides opportunities for valuable
environmental education initiatives.
Established tourist accommodation
The existence of many private sector enterprises in the area, from well-established
game farms to more recent B&Bs, provides opportunities for partnerships, without
the need for significant new capital developments.
Unsightly developments
The lack of current unsightly developments in the area provides an opportunity for
aesthetically pleasing areas within the proposed gAENP. The Coega IDZ will,
however, impact on the aesthetic value of the park in the future.

Coastal & Environmental Services
Safety
The Eastern Cape is malaria-free20, which allows for an attractive and unique
marketing edge. It is also considered politically stable and has a lower crime rate
than other provinces in South Africa.
Private sector and community involvement
Eco-tourism also lends itself very well to developing and building partnerships with
the private sector and with communities. The array of opportunities in the gAENP
presented for tourism will give communities and the private sector a wide range of
tourism facilities in which to participate.
6.4.2 CONSTRAINTS
Perceptions of the Eastern Cape
The Eastern Cape is underdeveloped and is characterised by a lack of appropriate
employment for the existing population, lack of capacity at all levels, from senior civil
servants to grassroots level, and a resultant endemic and deepening poverty. These
poor perceptions are a constraint as they hinder tourism and international investment
and may discourage certain agencies from investing in the gAENP.
Coega development
The presence of the proposed Coega port and IDZ would provide visual constraints
as well as the potential for oil spills.
6.4.3 MITIGATION MEASURES
Tourism organisations should be tasked with promoting the Eastern Cape as a
suitable tourist destination. The institutions involved in tourism as well as
recommendations as to suitable tourism institutional arrangements are discussed in
Chapter 7.
20 Malaria is recognised as a major threat to tourism.

7. THE LEGAL AND INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT
7.1 WHAT IS THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR DEVELOPING THE
GAENP?
The Terms of Reference provided by SANParks stated that the SEA should assess
resource use options according to principles of ecological, social and economic
sustainability. Guidance is provided by the National Environmental Management Act
(NEMA, Act No. 107 of 1998), the White Paper on an Environmental Management
Policy for South Africa (Republic of South Africa 1997), the White Paper for
Sustainable Coastal Development in South Africa (Coastal Management Policy
Programme, 1999), the Guideline Document: Strategic Environmental Assessment in
South Africa (Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism, 2000) and the
National Parks Act, as well as the South African constitution.
The constitution states that:
'... everyone has the right to an environment that is not harmful to their health
or well being: and to have the environment protected for the benefit of present
and future generations through reasonable legislative and other measures
that 1) prevent pollution and ecological degradation; 2) promote conservation;
and 3) secure ecologically sustainable development and use of natural
resources while promoting justifiable economic and social development'
Chapter 1 of NEMA contains the following relevant principles:
"2. Environmental management must place people and their needs at the
forefront of its concern, and serve their physical, psychological,
developmental, cultural and social interests equitably.
3. Development must be socially, environmentally, and economically sustainable.
4. (a) Sustainable development requires the consideration of all relevant factors
including
(i)  that the disturbance of ecosystems and loss of biological diversity
are avoided, or, where they cannot be altogether avoided, are
minimised and remedied;
(vii) that a risk-averse and cautious approach is applied, which takes into
account the limits of current knowledge about the consequences of
decisions and actions
(f) The participation of all interested and affected parties in environmental
governance must be promoted, and all people must have the opportunity

interested and affected parties, and this includes recognising all forms of
knowledge, including traditional and ordinary knowledge. [...]

Another important principle is contained in section 3 of the Development Facilitation
Act:
"Each proposed land development area should be judged on its own merits and
no particular use of land, such as residential, commercial, conservational,
industrial, community facility, mining, agricultural or public use, should in
advance or in general be regarded as being less important or desirable than any
other use of land."
These and other accepted principles of sustainable development, such as those
stated in Agenda 21 (UNCED, 1992), provided the basis for this assessment.
At present, in South Africa, SEA has no legal status, and this SEA has not been
prepared in terms of any land use planning or environmental legislation. This SEA
serves as a synthesis of existing information and identifies the opportunities and
constraints the environment poses for the proposed gAENP programme.
In keeping with the above, the proposed gAENP programme and the SEA take into
account the opportunity for the gAENP to alleviate poverty in the region, improve
living standards of disadvantaged communities, satisfactory resettlement where
applicable, Black Economic Empowerment (BEE), sustainable tourism, local
employment and outsourcing strategies while preserving the biodiversity of the area,
thus meeting international conservation requirements.
7.2 WHAT IS THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK FOR
CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT?
Many aspects of conservation management are shared national and provincial
competencies. In most cases the activities of national institutions are geared towards
the development and implementation of a national framework conservation policy.
They are also central players in overseeing the provisions of a number of
international conservation conventions. Provincial departments, in particular the
provincial conservation authority, by contrast, have been devolved certain powers to
implement national policy provisions.
7.2.1 NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS
There are currently seven national institutions active in the planning domain. These
include:
The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT): The lead agent
for environmental management in South Africa. DEAT's function is increasingly
concerned with policy development and coordination of environmental
management by other conservation agencies, except for the management of
marine resources, which is an exclusive national government competence largely
managed directly by DEAT through Marine and Coastal Management (MCM).
Although many hands-on environmental management activities are assigned to
the provinces, DEAT remains a key institution in the realisation of the gAENP.
The Department of Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) is focused on managing
South Africa's water and forestry resources. DWAF's interest in the land within
the domain is linked to its ownership of demarcated state forest land, the
ownership of the Darlington Dam wall, the provision of wate,r services and the
conservation of water catchments.

landscapes and associated cultural assets of South Africa for the joy and benefit
of the nation'. Corporate objectives that are of relevance to the gAENP oroject

7.2.2 NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS
A number of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) play a role in conservation
management. The International Foundation for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and Humane
Society of the United States (HSUS), Leslie Hill Succulent Trust, and Rhino &
Elephant Foundation have collectively funded the purchase of approximately
20 000ha of land. The Wildlife and Environment Society of Southern Africa (WESSA)
also takes an active interest in the proposed park and its development.
Other national environment and development NGOs whose activities potentially have
a bearing on the proclamation of the proposed gAENP include: South African
National NGO Coalition (SANGOCO), Rural Development Services Network
(RDSN), National Land Committee (NLC), Group for Environmental Monitoring
(GEM), Kagiso Trust (KT), National Development Agency (NDA), Africa Resources
Trust (ART), and South African Environment Project (SAEP).
The Eastern Cape Game Management Association (ECGMA) seeks to promote and
regulate the game farming and hunting sector in the province. It acts as liaison
between its members and conservation authorities.
7.2.3 PROVINCIAL, DISTRICT AND MUNICIPAL INSTITUTIONS
The Eastern Cape Department of Economic Affairs, Environment and Tourism
(DEAET), aims to build a sound, growing and sustainable economy which facilitates
economic empowerment and delivers an optimal quality of life for all citizens of the
Eastern Cape. This is to be achieved through the efficient utilisation and
management of environmental resources, the promotion of investment and the
strategic deployment of the human and financial resources at its disposal. Within this
department are:
. The Chief Directorate: Environmental Affairs (CD:EA), primarily tasked with
conservation responsibilities within the province.
. The Eastern Cape Tourism Board (ECTB), which retains conservation
management responsibilities over protected areas in the former Ciskei. The
ECTB Division: Game Reserves, therefore, is an interested party in the process
of transferring the remaining Provincial Nature Reserves within the planning
domain to SANParks.
• The Eastern Cape Development Corporation (ECDC), which plays an active role
in promoting investment in the Eastern Cape and in providing soft loans to
emerging entrepreneurs.
The Eastern Cape Department of Agriculture and Land Affairs (ECDALA), has the
functions of carrying out land use planning at a provincial scale, generating
information on the natural resources of the province and contributing to the
formulation of policy and standards. The following perform various functions for the
(ECDALA):
* The Sundays River Irrigation Board acts as an intermediary between DWAF and
the farmers of the Sundays River Valley, and has been registered in terms of the
provisions for Irrigation Boards as contained in the National Water Act.
* The Eastern Province Agricultural Union (EPAU) represents approximately 150
Farmers Associations in the Eastern Cape.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                90



Coastal & Environmental Services
The Eastern Cape Disadvantaged Farmers' Union represents the interests of
black aspirant farmers in the province.
The Directorate of Town Planning in the Eastern Cape Department of Housing and
Local Govemment is driving the Integrated Development Planning process in the
province. This process involves the consideration of environmental issues.
The Western District Municipality (WDM) was once part of the Western District
Council (WDC) and has traditionally played an important role in conservation
management and land use planning in the planning domain. The WDC has now
been divided into the WDM and Nelson Mandela Metropole. The WDM's jurisdiction
is now mostly the rural areas falling outside the metropole.
A number of Local Municipalities (Blue Crane Route Municipality, Ndlambe
Municipality, Sundays River Municipality and lkwesi Municipality) have jurisdiction
over portions of the planning domain and are likely to have certain planning and
conservation management authorities within their areas. Liaison between SANParks
and these local municipalities is essential.
Local NGOs such as the Community Environmental Network (CEN) in Port Elizabeth
and the Port Elizabeth Museum are local institutions that form part of the
conservation framework for the gAENP. In addition, there are a number of more
specialised 'environmental societies', e.g. the wildflower society, the herpetological
society, etc in Port Elizabeth that represent public interest in conservation issues.
7.3 HOW EFFECTIVE IS CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT IN THE
PLANNING DOMAIN?
7.3.1 INTRODUCTION
The two agencies tasked with protected area management responsibilities in the
domain are SANParks and the Chief Directorate: Environmental Affairs.
SANParks, with their long history of practical conservation management in a wide
variety of landscapes, habitats and species, have developed technical skills and
competencies. By virtue of their national park status and world-renowned
conservation activities, they also draw on expertise from outside the organisation,
from the international conservation world, local tertiary institutions and private
consulting firms (both local and foreign).
The SANParks statutory status and financial independence has largely driven their
desire to become financially self-sufficient. At present the SANParks generates
about 86% of its own budget, with no other conservation body able to compete with
this. A greater focus on becoming financially more efficient has necessitated various
changes within the institutional arrangement of the organisation, including a capacity
building programme (funded by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and
DANCED21), diversifying their wildlife products through outsourcing of commercial
operations, involving local communities in management and other activities within
21Danish government agency

Coastal & Environmental Services
and around the national parks (which resulted in the formation of SANParks' Social
Ecology Department).
The provincial conservation agency, the Chief Directorate: Environmental Affairs
(CD:EA), has also undergone considerable change, restructuring and re-naming in
the past few years, and is subject to similar pressures and constraints as those
experienced by SANParks. It remains cash strapped given a relatively low priority by
the Provincial government, which only allocated 1.3% of the Eastern Cape's
provincial budget compared to 83% on Health, Welfare and Education. Their
department lacks capacity at present given a large number of resignations over the
last few years. They are also severely limited by a lack of incentives to increase their
financial independence, as they are a non-parastatal organisation, a crucial step in
managing one's own financial system.
7.3.2 PROTECTED AREAS
Protected areas within the planning domain include AENP, Woody Cape Nature
Reserve, Tootabie Nature Reserve and the off-shore islands. All are currently State
owned.
The AENP is currently managed by SANParks and is staffed by 99 employees
engaged mostly in conservation or tourism activities. The park incorporates the
original AENP as well as the Zuurberg National Park.
With Tootabie Nature Reserve and Woody Cape Nature Reserve (previously
managed by the Chief Directorate: Environmental Affairs) having been transferred to
SANParks as of 1 April 2002, the large state-owned land falls under the SANParks,
making for unified conservation under a single Act. SANParks will manage the
islands although the legal transfer will follow in the near future. The Provincial staff
component of 27 has transferred entirely over to SANParks.
Privately owned protected areas within the planning domain include three private
game parks, three conservancies and two known heritage sites.
7.3.3 EFFECTIVENESS OF CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT
Comparing the effectiveness of conservation management of the two areas is
difficult due to the diversity of landscapes and ecosystems in the planning domain,
and consequently the intensity of management required.
Three criteria were used to attempt to determine the effectiveness of conservation
management in the planning domain:
* Rands spent per hectare
• Number of conservation personnel per hectare
* Capacity to deal with threats
Rands spent per hectare and number of conservation personnel per hectare
The results of the comparison showed that AENP spends R23/ha and employs 1
person per 1 860ha for conservation operations. Woody Cape Nature Reserve
(WCNR) spends R19/ha and employs 1 person per 894ha for conservation
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                92



Coastal & Environmental Services
operations. Therefore, AENP spends more per hectare on conservation operations,
but makes more efficient use of its staff.
Capacity to deal with threats
The capacity of the organisations to deal with threats to biodiversity was evaluated
as a function of both legislation and institutional strength, and also a function of the
nature and size of any given area, which in turn influences the 'resilience' of that
area to threat or trauma.
In terms of legislation, the National Parks Act (57 of 1995), being nationally
proclaimed legislation, would provide a protected area with a greater degree of
security than provincial legislation such as the Nature and Conservation Ordinance
(No 19 of 1974). For instance the Woody Cape Nature Reserve Management Plan
(Briers & Powell, 1994) identifies a number of threats, most of which originate from
outside the protected areas, but others, such as the over-utilisation of groundwater,
or the threat of mineral extraction (calcium carbonate mining), either do, or could,
take place within the reserve itself. National legislation would provide stronger
protection in both these cases. The incorporation of Woody Cape, including the
coastline (which below the high water mark is currently afforded no protection) and
contiguous areas of forest and coastal bush into the gAENP would inevitably provide
greater protection against other threats such as clearance of dune forest around the
reserve borders, and the ecological threat posed by a lack of 'mega-herbivores', as
identified in the management plan.
However, the National Parks Act does not give SANParks any authority over
activities affecting conservation of land outside of national parks, whereas the
provincial ordinance does. The degree of protection afforded to areas outside state
proclaimed and managed reserves, however, is extremely variable as seen in the
implementation of the Nature Conservation Ordinance in relation to conservancies.
Although a degree of protection is afforded to some components of the biota under
such legislation, this is not sufficient to meet international criteria for the conservation
of biodiversity.
In terms of institutional strength, both SANParks and the Chief Directorate:
Environmental Affairs are currently engaged in corporate restructuring processes.
The fluidity of the institutional terrain therefore makes it extremely difficult, and
possibly premature, to evaluate institutional strength. What can be said, however, is
that the restructuring processes generally lead to uncertainty amongst staff members
and, in some cases, may affect the systems dealing with (operational) resource
allocation. Furthermore, SANParks is in the process of redrafting the National Parks
Act (57 of 1976) to bring it in line with the constitution and also grant it greater
acceptability, without compromising its central biodiversity conservation theme.
Both organisations have in the recent past experienced considerable financial
pressures, with reductions in subsidies from either national or provincial government.
SANParks has moved to a situation where most parks are now 'business units',
which are expected, in the short term, to fund their own operations. AENP, with an
expenditure of R7 million/annum against a self-generated income of R6.2 million,
appears well on the way to achieving financial self-sufficiency.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                     93



Coastal & Environmental Services
The CD:EA is faced with the dual problem of a large number of supernumeraries and
an acute shortage of skilled personnel, particularly scientists. They have in the past
also found it difficult to manage their protected areas as business units as any
monies received would be handed back to the central coffers.
Both Woody Cape and the Islands have management plans, but as they are more
than five years old, they are in need of revision and updating.
Although bio-geographical influence is not a function of institutional capacity, a brief
examination of the nature and size of the protected areas can serve to mediate the
cruder indicators of staff numbers, costs, and even legislation, in terms of the
effectiveness of biodiversity conservation.
One of the fundamental premises upon which the proposal for the gAENP has been
founded is the sense that in biodiversity conservation 'single large' is better than
'several small'. The larger the area under protective management, the more resilient
it is in terms of its ability to respond to traumatic events, and the more potential there
is for the full functioning of dynamic ecological systems, as well as greater economic
opportunities. The minimum area for such viability varies considerably depending on
the particular biome represented, the species within it or using it, its fragility, and on
its degree of isolation from similar or complementary habitats.
In terms of the management implications for protected areas, the smaller, the more
isolated and the more fragile the habitat, the more vulnerable it tends to be and the
higher the level of management intervention required for its conservation.
In the context of the gAENP and the areas currently under protected area
management, the habitats that could be considered most fragile and most
ecologically dynamic, and therefore most vulnerable to 'unnatural' levels of
disturbance, are probably the Woody Cape dunefield interfaces, coastal forests,
islands and mesic thicket vegetation. Active management is therefore necessarily
more intense than in the areas of valley thicket or karoo of which the AENP mostly
comprises. The threats to these habitats posed by an increasing elephant population
and alien plants also necessitate active management intervention, but the inherent
robustness and resilience of these systems renders them less liable to permanent
damage, and they are also less sensitive to activities or events in neighbouring
areas.
The seeming disparity between the staffing levels at AENP and Woody Cape is
therefore not as clear-cut as might appear.
Specific areas of capacity
Conservation - Both SANParks and the Chief Directorate: Environmental Affairs are
principally concerned with the conservation of biodiversity, and the majority of their
reserve staff are dedicated to the practical implementation of biodiversity
conservation management. The levels of expertise displayed are difficult to establish,
but in the particular protected areas under consideration, there seems to be
adequate capacity to fulfil this core function, both within SANParks at AENP, and the
Chief Directorate: Environmental Affairs at Woody Cape. The growth of the area
*under AENP management has apparently been readily absorbed within existing
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                  94



Coastal & Environmental Services
conservation staff capacity (Edwin Wilson, SANParks, pers. comm.). As the park
expands further, though, there will be a need for increases in conservation staffing.
The lack of capacity at a scientific level within Chief Directorate: Environmental
Affairs, and a decline in the management of Tootabie and the Algoa Island Nature
Reserves are combination of the organisational problems currently being
experienced, the peculiar logistical challenges associated with small remote reserves
and islands, and a lack of technical capacity for conservation management.
Community Liaison and Partnerships - Although this is not immediately evident as a
core conservation function, developing relationships and partnerships with park
neighbours is often crucial to the success of biodiversity conservation both within the
park boundaries and in the surrounding areas. SANParks recognised this in the
establishment of a Social Ecology Department, which has recently been transferred
to operate as a unit within the conservation department. At AENP there are currently
only two full-time social ecologists with one student assistant. The gAENP involves
liaison with large numbers of neighbouring communities and individuals over a
considerable period of time, and it would seem clear that at present, SANParks at
AENP lacks the capacity, in terms of staff available, to carry out this function
effectively, particularly as demands upon it are to increase with expansion of the
park.
Although community liaison is identified in the Woody Cape Management Plan as an
important function of the reserve, no staff are dedicated to this, and again it seems
that the Chief Directorate: Environmental Affairs, too, lack capacity in this area.
7.4 WHAT ROLE DO EXISTING INSTITUTIONAL STAKEHOLDERS
PLAY IN TOURISM?
As with conservation management, many aspects of tourism are shared national and
provincial competencies. A number of non-governmental organisations are also
involved. There is very little co-ordinated tourism support.
The provincial and local government institutions in the Addo area are currently not
fulfilling their mandate in terms of stimulating and supporting tourism businesses in
disadvantaged communities. This is largely due to financial and human resources
constraints, while SANParks is attempting to encourage such developments through
the outsourcing process (day/night drives, concessionaires).
Several sectors, including business, disadvantaged communities and farmers, argue
that the current AENP is not reaching out to people enough, and linking with other
local and regional tourism initiatives. The gAENP will be an international drawcard to
the area, and thus it is recommended that SANParks take a proactive lead in all
tourism initiatives in the region, and integrate within the tourism sector and across
sectors.
7.4.1 THE NATIONAL POLICY FRAMEWORK FOR TOURISM
Government policies, such as the Reconstruction and Development Programme
(RDP) (1994) and the Rural Development Strategy (1995), note the potential of
tourism to encourage economic development and job creation in rural areas.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                 95



Coastal & Environmental Services
Additional objectives of the strategy are the provision of infrastructure, the promotion
of local economic development, SMMEs (Small, Medium and Micro-enterprises) and
small-scale agriculture. The White Paper on South African Land Policy (April 1997)
stresses economic growth, development and poverty alleviation through
opportunities for small-scale production. This may be achieved through release of
public land for housing and recreation, and the creation or expansion of commonage
for food gardens, grazing, fuelwood and eco-tourism.
The White Paper on the Development and Promotion of Tourism in South Africa
(May 1996) sees the promotion of Responsible Tourism, developed in line with RDP
principles, as a key opportunity for economic growth. Responsible tourism aims to
achieve sustainability in terms of social, economic and environmental objectives. The
Transformation Strategy for the SA Tourism Industry (February 2001) stresses the
importance of community-based tourism, Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) and
provision of support to tourism via SMMEs.
The National Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism supports a National
Tourism Clustering Initiative, called South African Tourism: a Collaborative Strategy
for Development and Delivery. Eco-tourism has been identified as a key thematic
cluster and the Eastern Cape, with its mix of nature-based wildlife, historical and
cultural tourism is seen as having significant eco-tourism potential. Other national
government initiatives such as the Sustainable Coastal Development Programme,
provide a framework for sustainable development. However, the institutional
framework is not yet in place at a provincial or regional level for this to form part of
an effective integrated tourism strategy, but needs recognition as a formal sector in
industry.
The 1996 White Paper on Development and Promotion of Tourism sets out the roles
of national, provincial and local tiers of government, the private sector, labour,
communities, women, NGOs, the media and conservation agencies.
Government statistics are not published for tourism as an independent industry.
However, it is believed that tourism is growing at about 5% p.a. as opposed to a
growth of less than 3% in the economy overall. 58% of foreign tourists visit the
Western Cape compared with 14% to the Eastern Cape. South Africa's game
reserves and protected areas are a major attraction for tourists: around 58% of
foreign visitors experience some form of game-viewing but only 4% of foreign
tourists to the Eastern Cape in January 2002 visited game lodges in the province,
compared with 19% in Mpumalanga.
The South African government has stated that its target for GDP generation from
tourism is 10%. This would lead to the creation of 500 000 direct and indirect job
opportunities. The contribution that tourism makes to the South African economy is
not evenly spread across the provinces. The Eastern Cape has diverse attractions
for tourism potential - the beaches, big game fishing, mountains, game reserves and
hunting - but its share of the travel and tourism GDP is merely 8.2%, compared with
36.3% for KwaZulu-Natal and 21.5% for the Western Cape. The potential for growth
is therefore considerable. If the Eastern Cape is to increase its share of the national
target market to 13%, this would lead to 65 000 more job opportunities - equivalent
to the total presently employed in agriculture. The province is extremely well placed

Coastal & Environmental Services
to synergise and benefit from tourists to other areas, e.g. the Western Cape
generally and the Garden Route in particular. The gAENP has the capacity to
capitalise on its link to the Garden Route.
7.4.2 NATIONAL TOURISM AUTHORITIES
The Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) is the national tourism
authority and is the lead agent for tourism policy formulation, and for creating
incentives and an enabling environment to encourage tourism activities.
Many private authorities, private sector associations, NGOs and financial institutions
operating at a national level do not currently have direct involvement in the gAENP
area, but may be available to provide services such as training, marketing and
advice regarding standards, etc. as needed.
SANParks is a statutory body, with one of its objectives being the encouragement of
appropriate access to material, cultural, recreational and educational resources of
national parks through eco-tourism. The national commercialisation and outsourcing
strategy aims to enable the private sector to deliver certain tourism functions, such
as shops, accommodation and restaurants in order to improve efficiency and
contribute to local economic development.
7.4.3 PROVINCIAL TOURISM STAKEHOLDERS
The provincial tourism organisations are key players in the tourism industry.
Schedule 6 of the Constitution makes specific provision for tourism to be a provincial
responsibility. The provincial government, through provincial tourism organisations,
has responsibility for marketing and promoting their destinations. These
organisations include Eastern Cape Department of Economic Affairs, Environment
and Tourism (DEAET), Eastern Cape Tourism Board (ECTB) and Eastern Cape
Development Corporation (ECDC).
7.4.4 LOCAL AUTHORITIES
The functions of the local government mirror those of the provincial government, but
with added emphasis on the planning, development and maintenance of many
specific aspects of the tourism product. Local government is a key role player with
regard to affirmative Procurement Policies, Infrastructure Investment, the national
Welcome Campaign and Information Management.
District municipalities such as the Western District Council (WDC) have established
tourism focus groups, such as the Western Regional Tourism Organisation (WRTO).
The Transitional Councils of Paterson and Kirkwood see tourism as an important
issue, but they are so under-resourced that policy development is not on the agenda.
Local government has priorities in terms of delivery of basic services, as well as the
function of local economic development (LED), for which tourism is seen as a local
development priority.
7.4.5 LOCAL TOURISM ASSOCIATIONS
Three local tourism associations are actively involved in promoting tourism to the
respective areas. Tourism PE is a well-established tourism marketing and promotion
organisation, which largely confines its operation to the Port Elizabeth area. It has a

Coastal & Environmental Services
good working relationship with the East London tourism authority and has recently
forged a marketing partnership with the Western Cape.
Sundays River Valley Tourism Forum (SRVTF) is a volunteer marketing and
business promotion body for tourism in the Kirkwood/Addo area. The SRVTF is
represented at meetings of the ECTB and Tourism PE.
Addo Tourism is actively involved with upliftment of the Addo area, including tourism
opportunities and facilities.
7.4.6 PRIVATE SECTOR AND COMMUNITIES
The private sector has and will continue to play a critically important role in the
further development and promotion of tourism. The private sector bears the major
risks of tourism investment as well as a large part of the responsibility for satisfying
the visitor. The private sector is in a position to promote the involvement of local
communities in tourism ventures by, inter alia, establishing partnership tourism
ventures with communities. The concessionaire programme (Gorah Elephant and
Nyati) in Addo encourages such ventures and is in fact part of contract terms.
Established tourism businesses in the Addo area are mostly white-owned. Many
small businesses and private entrepreneurs are directly involved in the tourism
sector in the Greater Addo area. These include tour operators (cultural, nature-based
and adventure tourism), accommodation establishments, hunting enterprises and
guides. In addition, suppliers of foodstuffs, car rental companies, etc. stand to benefit
from an expansion of tourism.
Several private game reserves that cater for tourists are located near to the AENP.
Many of the B&Bs and other accommodation establishments market these reserves
to their clients.
The Addo Liaison Committee was established in 1993 to bring together
representatives of the AENP, the neighbouring community of Nomathamsanqa and
local farmers associations. The forum is now called Mayibuye Ndlovu Project
(MNDP), and its goals are to plan and implement conservation-based community
development projects and to support emerging tourism initiatives in disadvantaged
communities living around the AENP. Current and proposed projects under the
MNDP include tour guide training, performing arts projects, arts and crafts projects,
and capacity building. The Addo Planning Forum (APF) has taken such linkages to
a higher level for the whole planning domain, with representation from local
government, provincial and national departments, the business sector, tourism, local
communities, NGOs and agriculture.
Linkages between local communities and established tourism businesses such as
lodges and restaurants are usually limited to employment as cooks and cleaners.
However, certain tourism enterprises, such as the Elephant House B&B, have stated
an interest in assisting disadvantaged communities to establish their own B&Bs and
in hiring cultural groups to perform for their clients. Concessionaire obligations are
more orientated to capacity building.

Coastal & Environmental Services
Although provincial tourist organisations are mandated to encourage local
community involvement in tourism, there appears to be virtually no co-ordinated
national or provincial support framework. Disadvantaged communities perceived
better linkages with Shamwari, AENP and SANParks than with the provincial and
local authorities such as the Western District Council, Eastern Cape Tourism Board,
Department of Economic Affairs, Environment and Tourism, and Tourism PE. The
provincial and local government institutions in the Addo area are currently not
fulfilling their mandate in terms of stimulating and supporting tourism businesses in
disadvantaged communities, largely due to financial and human resources
constraints.
7.4.7 OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY
As it is usually the quality of the eco-tourism experience delivered by the labour force
that determines the true quality of the tourism experience, the labour force plays a
vital role in the tourism industry. Labour should be adequately trained, housed and
prepared for the tourist market. Women, especially in rural communities, have a
particularly important role to play in the development of responsible tourism. The
employment of women can be a fundamental determinant of the development
impacts of the tourism industry.
Environmental and community-based NGOs are expected to play a vital role in the
development and spread of responsible tourism practices, as are the local media
sources.
7.5 WHAT OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS DOES THE
INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT PRESENT?
Table 7.5 lists the opportunities and constraints presented by the institutional
environment for gAENP. These are discussed in more detail in sections 7.5.1 and
7.5.2.

Coastal & Environmental Services
7.5.1 OPPORTUNITIES
High institutional capacity within SANParks
The high institutional capacity within SANParks and numerous opportunities for
partnerships, coupled with the large number of tourist related initiatives in the gAENP
planning domain are seen as significant opportunities. The high institutional capacity
in SANParks provides an existing secure base for the development of the gAENP
programme.
Institutional support
The proposed gAENP is a state-initiated and thus state-supported programme, and
thus has National Government support. It also has global support in the form of GEF
funding and interest from international conservation and animal welfare
organisations. This support presents opportunities for partnerships, incentives and
funding.
Partnerships
The possibility of building partnerships with surrounding landowners will benefit both
SANParks and the landowner, as Private Public Partnerships mean greater business
opportunities. This is already happening with contractual park arrangements and
concessionaires.
7.5.2 CONSTRAINTS
Govemment capacity
The low capacity within the Eastern Cape Government remains a constraint. The
administrative terrain is highly complex and fluid and the low capacity at provincial
government level, including the parastatal (Eastern Cape Tourism Board) mandated
to develop tourism initiatives and thus promote tourism, could provide a constraint to
the park, particularly in the areas of tourism, conservation and land use zoning
decisions.
SANParks policy
This current policy emphasises local community involvement advancing cultural
values and empowerment. However, this may be in conflict with its business
orientation, which favours commercialisation of its tourism products. These two
policy foci are antithetical: the first objective usually yields a result that is not very
business-like; the second tends to exclude, marginalise or distort local communities
and their culture. This could pose a threat in an area where rural communities are
poor and unlikely to be in a position to invest in private or commercial enterprises.
SANParks commercialisation policy, however, has a strong black empowerment
component that must be incorporated into the development of the gAENP.
Other tourism organisations
There is little co-ordination between the numerous tourism organisations in and
around the Addo area.

Coastal & Environmental Services
7.6 HOW CAN THE OPPORTUNITIES BE OPTIMISED AND
CONSTRAINTS MITIGATED?
Conservation management
The consolidation of conservation management under one authority (in this case
SANParks) will mitigate many of the current constraints, such as poor inter-agency
co-ordination, institutional weaknesses, confusion in land administration, etc. This
has largely been achieved with the incorporation of Provincial reserves into the
AENP.
It is important that the management capacity within SANParks is maintained and
strengthened where necessary. The following recommendations are applicable:
. Pursue and implement the recommendations emanating from the capacity
review process.
• Bring in new skills that are appropriate to the conservation requirements of this
diversity of habitats, and provide appropriate training to develop the capacity of
existing staff for the management of these areas.
. Ensure that there are sufficient numbers of skilled and suitably equipped
personnel to manage community park partnerships. The minimum
recommended complement is five (5) social ecologists.
Tourism
To address the fragmentation, confusion and conflicting mandates existing in current
institutions involved with tourism, it is recommended that a workshop be convened to
focus on tourism development and management in the Greater Addo planning
domain. This should bring together SANParks, Eastern Cape Tourism Board,
Department of Economic Affairs Environment and Tourism, Eastern Cape
Development Corporation (ECDC) and other financial and marketing institutions,
Sundays River Valley Tourism Forum (SRVTF), Addo Tourism, local authorities,
Mayibuye Ndlovu Development Programme (MNDP), local communities with a
strong potential to develop eco-tourism such as Enon, local tourism experts and
consultants, and local entrepreneurs and operators.
An opportunity exists for SANParks to build relationships and to assist with capacity
building in tourist orientated organisations. This will not only assist with attracting
tourists to the gAENP, but also to the Eastern Cape.
Other government departments
Certain government departments will continue to play a role in land and resource
management, but this will mostly be restricted to the 'buffer zone' and to certain
aspects of marine and coastal management. Institutional sustainability will therefore
also relate to the effectiveness of on-going co-ordination and co-operation between
SANParks and these departments.
Neighbour relations
The success of civil-sector participation and neighbour support lies in the
establishment of a strong, representative and well supported Park Management
Committee and a Park Steering Committee (see section 7.7).
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                101



Coastal & Environmental Services
The sustainability of the institutional environment with respect to neighbouring
previously disadvantaged communities will largely depend on the future strength and
influence of the Social Ecology section based at the park. Of critical importance will
be the degree to which it is able to contribute towards addressing issues of basic
human needs (land, housing, water, services, etc.) and the development aspirations
of neighbouring communities through interactions with appropriate government and
development organisations. Institutionally this will require collaboration with relevant
public and civil sector organisations. It will also require the appointment/deployment
of addition numbers of skilled social ecologists as well as the implementation of the
Resettlement Policy Framework.
Diversity in land ownership
SANParks also needs to think creatively about realising the potential of the gAENP.
Innovative use of the biodiversity can flow from greater diversity in land ownership
and management models for the gAENP, and preparedness to engage in contractual
arrangements with neighbours, and the sustainable use of resources by these
neighbours. This is very much part of SANParks' current thinking.
7.7 WHAT INSTITUTIONAL STRUCTURES ARE PROPOSED?
The gAENP programme is to be developed and implemented primarily by the
SANParks, but in partnership with the provincial Department of Economic Affairs,
Environment  and  Tourism  (DEAET),  national  government  departments
(Environmental Affairs and Tourism, Land Affairs, Labour), various non-government
organisations (NGOs), community-based organisations (CBOs), the farming
community, academic institutions, private landowners and private enterprise.
Co-operation and integration of the various institutions will be arranged on the
following basis:
Park Management Unit (PMU)
A PMU consisting of about three persons (Project Manager, finance, procurement
and administrative officers) will be established. Its tasks will include: (i) development
and co-ordinating the drafting of development, management and business plans by
consultants; (ii) day-to-day management of project development and implementation
of the project implementation plan (PIP); (iii) annual work plans and budget
preparation based primarily upon input from SANParks; (iv) donor coordination; (v)
secretariat function for the Project Steering Committee (PSC) and the Addo Planning
Forum (APF); (vi) financial management including establishing a financial
management system, disbursement, financial reporting, procurement of consultants
goods and services for the project, as well as establishment of the management
responsibility together with Addo management; (vii) development of an EMS;
(viii) facilitate investor involvement; (ix) coordination of the APF and its sub-
committees; (x) establishment of Park Committee (PC); (xi) coordination of project
consultants; (xii) report generation (annual and as required), including reporting to
the World Bank on project execution.
Addo Planning Forum (APF)
The APF was originally established in 1999 to ensure that stakeholder interests are
known and fully considered by the project planner and to communicate progress and
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL               102



Coastal & Environmental Services
planning proposals to stakeholders. Although this forum has been effective in certain
areas, the majority of the affected communities are not represented, in particular the
farm workforce. They are not represented by any body, and are thus a difficult
amorphous group to interact with. Even established agriculture has difficulty in this
regard, and many of the members do not attend the meetings.
The composition and function of the APF should be restructured according to the
recommendation given in Specialist Report 14. The aims of restructuring the APF
are to provide a forum with adequate and real representation while not creating a
large unwieldy body; encourage full participation while not expecting representatives
to necessarily engage with issues with which they are neither interested or
knowledgeable; and ensure genuine input while keeping the clear responsibility for
planning and management with SANParks. Specific recommendations are:
Greater representation of those most directly affected by the proposed gAENP
needs to be secured. This should be done by direct approach to communities.
The formation of specialist sub-committees to afford greater representation and
dissemination of information. Three sub-committees have already been formed
(NGOs, agriculture and previously disadvantaged groups). Further sub-
committees should include environment and conservation; tourism and
marketing; community and partnerships; information and media, and municipal
interests.
. Direct stakeholder input into the APF needs to be secured by actively
encouraging their regular attendance and participation, and by their involvement
in debate over issues of particular significance to them.
* The draft constitution for the APF should serve to clarify the role and function of
the forum, and needs to be adopted as soon as possible.
lntra-departmental government institutions having a number of separate internal
structures or programmes relevant to gAENP should establish an internal
mechanism for co-ordination, thereby reducing the need for the representation of
numerous officials from the same department on the Addo Planning Forum.
Two specific management structures have been mooted for the management of the
gAENP after final establishment and proclamation.
Park Management Committee (PMC)
This committee will take over the function of the APF. Its main function will be to
enable local stakeholders to have input into the management of the park through the
monitoring of its implementation (see specialist report 17 for additional information
on the PMC).
The objectives of the committee will be to:
Provide inputs in the park management plan through consultation with the park
management.
* Advise park management on the management of the national park in terms of its
management plan.
• Assist park management to monitor the implementation of the management plan
at meetings arranged for this purpose.
* Periodically assist in reviewing the management plan.
The composition of the PMC should ideally include:
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                 103



* Coastal & Environmental Services
* Elected representatives of communities.
* Representatives of agencies with statutory and other interests in the park.
* Individuals from civil society whose skills can contribute to the park.
Project Steering Committee (PSC)
The PSC is already in the process of being established, and although it is not fully
functional at present, it meets four times a year. After final proclamation of the
gAENP, the purpose of the Park Steering Committee, which will comprise primarily
SANParks management staff but also landowners and concessionaires within the
park and invited 'experts', will be to discuss and agree to day-to-day technical
management issues such as stocking rates, animal movements, water provision,
vegetation management, game drive routes, and other practical aspects (Specialist
Report 17 provides additional detail on the PSC).

8. ISSUES AND CONCERNS RAISED BY I&APs
8.1 INTRODUCTION
This chapter outlines the issues and concerns that have emerged through the public
participation process. These issues have been identified through networking
meetings with l&APs, written correspondence and telephonic communication.
The concept for the gAENP project emerged through a separate consultation
process that is not reflected in this report and therefore the support or the recognition
for the project that emerged during that process is also not reflected here. However,
it is important to note that the SEA for the gAENP is as a result of this initial
consultation process. A declaration in support of the gAENP emerged as a result of
the initial stakeholders meeting (section 2.5.3).
8.2 SUMMARY OF KEY ISSUES AND CONCERNS
The following gives an overview of the key issues and concerns that emerged
through the public participation process. Specialist Report 5 should be consulted to
obtain a detailed understanding of the issues and concerns raised. Issues appear in
no order of importance.
8.2.1 DISPLACEMENT AND RELOCATION OF FARM WORKERS
Issue
The displacement and relocation of farm workers presently employed within the
planning domain has been identified as a key issue by a cross-spectrum of l&APs
within and around the planning domain. A deep concern has been expressed with
regards to farm workers that have already lost their employment as a result of land
purchases and the future of other farm labourers within the affected area. The
relocation of farm workers is presently the sole responsibility of the farm owner and
there does not appear to be a mechanism in place to proactively link affected
workers with the future expansion of the Park. There is further no clarity on the
number of affected people or their location within the gAENP.
Response
A comprehensive Resettlement Policy Framework has been compiled and is
available  on  the  greater  Addo  Elephant  National  Park  webpage,
www.addoelephantpark.com. In order to conform to the RPF, individual Resettlement
Action Plans (RAPs) have been drawn up for each individual farm purchase,
including the principles set out in the RPF.
8.2.2 ONGOING UNCERTAINTY
Issue
Since the initiation of the project concept in 1996, affected parties within the planning
domain have been living in uncertainty with very little clarity on the project process
and the potential impacts. Issues regarding land have a deep personal significance
for affected l&APs, in some instances farms have been passed on through
generations and for many this is a way of life. Ongoing planning is required to ensure
the sustainability of the livelihoods of the farmer, his/her family and farm labourers.
The ongoing uncertainty around the boundaries for the gAENP and the

Coastal & Environmental Services
implementation process impacts on the short and long term planning of l&APs and
adds to negative perceptions of the gAENP project. To a large degree this
uncertainty arises from the fear of expropriation.
Response
SANParks is in the process of developing a comprehensive communication strategy
(section 5.5.4), which will assist in communication between SANParks and all
affected stakeholders. The draft communication strategy is available upon request
from South African National Parks (Port Elizabeth office). SANParks is in the process
of restructuring the Addo Planning Forum, as has been recommended (section 7.7).
The conservation planning exercise has determined areas of conservation
importance and implementation scenarios. Landowners should have a clearer idea
of the areas proposed for conservation and the land purchasing strategy (section 4.7
& 9.1). SANParks plans to only consolidate its boundaries in accordance with a land
acquisition policy, and use expropriation only for those key properties (most of the
owners in this regard have been contacted) as the very last option, with a willing-
buyer, willing-seller the preferred route. SANParks' actions to date demonstrates the
approach of seeking the most amicable agreement.
8.2.3 IMPACT ON FARMING RELATED INDUSTRIES AND ACTIVITIES
Issue
l&APs from across the planning domain have requested that an in-depth economic
assessment be done on farming related industries and activities within and around
the planning domain. For example, I&APs have expressed concern for the potential
negative economic and social impacts on towns within the gAENP as a result of the
loss of farming activities. That is, farming activities to a large degree economically
support the towns within the area.
Response
SANParks' economic review of agricultural activities in the domain (Specialist Report
10) revealed that ecotourism could compete with pastoral systems but not with
intensive dairy farming. In the light of this, high prices for land in the Alexandria area
and the generally low conservation priority of this area, indicates that SANParks
would need to explore innovative ways of including elements of this area into the
conservation plan. This does not mean a blanket purchase of dairy land.
Not all the land in the mohair producing area is suitable for conservation, as it has
been too severely grazed by small stock. Elements of conservation importance may
exist on some of the farms - in this case SANParks would negotiate a management
strategy suitable to both parties as a means of meeting some of the park objectives.
An economic assessment of the economically viable farming areas was
recommended in the SEA as some of the farming areas are important for the
economy of South Africa.
The economic assessment should include the impact of establishing the gAENP on
the mohair, wool and mutton industries and should not be limited to farming that is
economically viable, but should include farming that is important from a supply point
of view, to South Africa and international markets.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL               106



Coastal & Environmental Services
The C-Plan indicated that the Alexandria dairy farming area was not of critical
importance for conservation purposes and the socio-economic assessment
determined that it would not be viable for SANParks to mitigate the constraints
presented by this area. SANParks will not actively purchase land in the dairy farming
area to fulfil conservation targets. It is thus recommended that the Alexandria dairy
farming area be excluded from this economic assessment.
The Sundays River Estuary and the upper reaches of the Sundays River have been
identified as having a high biological significance and are also economically
important assets to the area. SANParks has committed itself to developing a
management/zonation plan for the river in consultation with affected parties and
residents to ensure that the use of the estuary and river are economically and
ecologically viable.
8.2.4 LACK OF COMMUNICATION WITH AFFECTED PARTIES
Issue
Poor communication with affected parties has resulted in a deep negative perception
of the project. The majority of I&APs within the gAENP are aware of the intention to
implement the project but have very little information on what this may mean for their
lives. This lack of information is exacerbated by the time period that has passed
since the inception of the project with very little feedback to affected parties.
Communication with I&APs needs to take into account the deep personal attachment
that affected parties have to their land. Reports stating that "all farming land is over
grazed" are potentially incorrect and detrimental to the project.
Response
See response to issue 8.2.2
8.2.5 IMPACT ON UNEMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES
Issue
This issue is linked to issue 8.2.1 above, the displacement and relocation of farm
workers. A number of I&APs fear that unemployment in the area will rise as a result
of the expansion of the park. In support of this statement they have stated incidences
where farm labourers within the affected area have already lost their employment
and livelihoods. There needs to be some indication of the number and type of jobs
that will be created through the expansion of the park.
Response
Employment opportunities will be presented by the gAENP. Temporary employment
will be offered using funding provided by the Working for Water Fund as well as by
Poverty Relief (section 5.5.2), while the conservation developments are established.
Estimates indicate that a total of 383 permanent, 71 contractual and 840 temporary
jobs will be created in the park, a total of 1 job per 100 ha, greater than the
agricultural ratio of 1 job per 367 ha (Table 8.2).

Coastal & Environmental Services
8.2.6 IMPACT CREATED BY THE COEGA INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ZONE
Issue
The proposed Coega Industrial Development Zone does not only have negative
spin-offs for gAENP.
Response
The proposed positive benefits that could potentially be derived from the Coega
Industrial Development Zone are not adequately identified or noted as opportunities
in the SEA. In as much as the Coega development needs to take into account the
gAENP, SANParks needs to take the Coega development into account in the
planning of the Park. Some of the positive benefits that could be derived from the
Coega IDZ are:
• Improvement of the infrastructure within the Metro as well as the infrastructure
within the IDZ that will back feed to the Metro, e.g. doubling of the N2, Neptune
Road.
. The IDZ's primary objective is job creation, especially to those who were
historically disadvantaged. This should lead to an increase in the disposable
income of people within the region particularly the local people. This again
creates the opportunity for the gAENP to be also enjoyed by the local people and
not only the tourists from outside Port Elizabeth and abroad.
* The visual guidelines of the Coega Project have shown that impacts beyond
10km distance are not significant to the gAENP.
8.2.7 NEED FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC INDICATORS AND TARGETS
The Draft SEA provides indicators for achieving biophysical and conservation targets
but does not provide indicators for achieving socio-economic targets for the
expansion of the Park. These guidelines are important to ensure that the
development is within sustainable limits, socially, ecologically and financially.
The Resettlement Plan gives indicators and targets for the social aspects of
resettlement, but indicators for achieving socio-economic targets for the expansion of
the Park are also required.
8.2.8 COMPLIANCE WITH THE SEA REGULATIONS
Issue
Will the recommendations given in the SEA be enforced and will they be legally
binding?
Response
There are currently no laws regulating the enforcement of recommendations given
by a Strategic Environmental Assessment. SANParks is a statutory body with its own
board that takes autonomous decisions. They report directly to the Minister and do
not require permission from DEAT.
SANParks are required to take cognisance of the relevant principles in NEMA (No.
107 of 1998, particularly Chapter 5) when planning and undertaking projects. The
Board is required to ensure compliance and to report to the Minister accordingly.

8.2.9 IMPACT ON DAIRY, BEEF AND CHICORY PRODUCTION
Issue
A cross-spectrum of I&APs in the Zuney, Nanagga and Alexandria area have raised
their concerns and noted their objection to the inclusion of this area in the park. Prior
to any decision being made on the project they have requested that a detailed
economic and social assessment be done, which looks at the local, regional and
national impacts of the loss of this area to dairy, beef and chicory production. Many
l&APs have noted that this area is South Africa's primary area for the production of
dairy.
Response
The C-Plan indicated that the Alexandria dairy farming area was not of critical
importance for conservation purposes and the socio-economic assessment
determined that it would not be viable for SANParks to mitigate the constraints
presented by this area. SANParks will not actively purchase land in the dairy farming
area to fulfil conservation targets, although SANParks would still consider land
purchases in the area on a willing buyer - willing seller basis.
8.2.10 IMPACT ON MOHAIR PRODUCTION
Issue
l&APs in Kommadagga, Kleinpoort, Waterford and Glenconner have requested that
a detailed social and economic assessment be done on the local, region, national
and international markets as a result of the potential loss of mohair production. The
Karoo Midlands area contributes 60% to the international production of mohair. A
detailed assessment would also distinguish between the different levels of
productivity of farms, as not all farms operated on the same level.
Response
Not all the land in the mohair producing area is suitable for conservation, as it has
been too severely grazed by small stock. Elements of conservation importance may
exist on some of the farms - in this case SANParks would negotiate a management
strategy suitable to both parties as a means of meeting some of the park objectives.
Should a farmer be willing to sell his farm, SANParks may negotiate.
8.2.11 LAND PURCHASE PROCESS
Issue
While the process for purchasing land does not fall within the scope of the SEA or
Public Participation it has impacted on the present public participation process.
Numerous negative comments have been received with regards to the approach that
is presently being used for the purchasing of land and the threat of expropriation; this
has in turn impacted on the perceptions of people in the area. The fact that land is
being bought while the SEA and public participation process is not yet complete has
further added to perceptions that the input of l&APs are of no value.
Response
SANParks are in the process of developing a Land Acquisition Policy to facilitate
land purchases in the expanded park. A draft incorporation matrix is available
through South African National Parks Board, Scientific Services (Port Elizabeth).

8.3 CONCLUSION
The proposal for the establishment of the proposed gAENP programme has elicited
an overwhelming response from I&APs within the planning domain. While there are
a number of issues and concerns that need to be taken into account in various areas
most l&APs have expressed in-principle support for the project, if implemented in an
acceptable, informative manner.
A project of this size, spanning 400 000 hectares, impacts directly on a number of
people's lives. Land ownership is a deeply personal matter and as such will elicit a
deep personal response. This personal attachment to land needs to be taken into
account when planning and implementing a project of this nature.
The diversity of the area adds a further challenge to the project and it should be
considered in the planning process. That is, beef, dairy, chicory, mohair and small
stock farming all take place within the planning domain. There are different levels of
productivity between these different sectors as well as differences within a specific
sector. That is, not all farmers operate at the same level of productivity and there
have been numerous requests for this to be taken into account when developing
strategies and communicating with l&APs. It is apparent that there are farmers who
are willing to sell their land but there are also those that do not wish to be
incorporated into the gAENP.
It is important for the project and the process that fundamental issues such as
communication with l&APs is addressed and the issues raised in this report are
taken into account in the future planning for the gAENP.

9. POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENT SCENARIOS
The conservation planning process identified areas of importance to conserve and
focused on implementation scenarios. Some of the areas identified as conservation
worthy may not necessarily be bought by SANParks, but certain management
options could be entered into between SANParks and the landowner. This opens an
array of opportunities for landowners who not only wish to conserve their land, but
also to be associated with the gAENP and its guaranteed eco-tourism attraction.
9.1 WHAT MANAGEMENT OPTIONS ARE THERE FOR THE
gAENP?
Since land acquisition is the largest cost component and since the biodiversity value
of the gAENP must be optimised as new land is added, SANParks must carefully
examine the areas to be acquired, and the scheduling of that acquisition and the
effect of each land purchase on the roll-out plan. It would be more desirable from a
management perspective to purchase all land and develop a Schedule 1 Park but
the cost and social implications are so huge, that the best way of harvesting the
ingenuity of people and save the environment is through a combination of means.
The significant spatial extent of the gAENP will open opportunities for all sectors.
State-owned conservation land is regarded as the core area around which other role
players may interact to varying degrees. Management options which make sound
economic sense, while at the same time being environmentally sustainable and
acceptable  should  guide  the  magnitude  of   this  interaction.  The
environmental/conservation parameters should be set out in the management plan
for the park, together with goals and objectives for conservation management. These
have been broadly articulated in a report by Knight and Castley (1999).
The management plan should also include wider economic goals for the greater
area. The policies articulated in this plan must dictate which activities and
interactions are acceptable, and permissible, and which are not. The plan will
inevitably involve balancing differences between various interest groups and
stakeholders. In the development plan produced by Knight and Castley (1999) two
key principles are laid down:
9.1.1 PRIVATE SECTOR
Including the private sector into the park reduces costs of land and game purchases,
roads, perimeter fencing and tourism developments. The spin-offs for SANParks for
including private land into gAENP are:
* Reduced capital fencing cost as the perimeter would now be on private land;
* Reduced fence maintenance costs;
* A larger area for game to traverse and therefore a more viable population for
genetic sustainability;
* Reduced management costs for the overall area as the private sector would
have to carry some of these costs; and
* Opportunities for diversifying the tourism products (e.g. hunting).
The specialist economic study (Specialist Report 13) provides further detail for
various sections of the gAENP, and different visitor forecasts and alternative land
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL               112



Coastal & Environmental Services
expansion possibilities. This report indicates that eco-tourism for the whole planning
domain, excluding the Alexandria area, would be the best option. Eco-tourism in the
Alexandria area would require a unique approach, would be very costly and is
therefore not recommended.
There is also an opportunity to allow the private sector to include their land into the
park under mutually agreed conditions, known as Contractual National Parks and
protected under the National Parks Act. This model is widely used in South Africa
and various options are available as in Marakele, Wilderness, West Coast,
Richtersveld and Augrabies Falls National Parks. Issues that will need to be agreed
on before this can happen include:
* A mutually acceptable management framework for the natural resources (this
should ideally vest with SANParks).
* Agreement regarding game ownership. This will probably vest with SANParks, at
least for the important species.
* Acceptance that ownerships rights are not affected, although use options may be
restricted.
* Agreement that traversing over other land must be allowed.
* Agreement on funding of management resources.
• Enforced access control.
This option would only be available to property that shares a common boundary with
the park. There may be many advantages to this arrangement for SANParks,
provided the above principles can be agreed. Benefits include the following:
* Increasing the area available for wildlife populations and therefore increasing
their genetic viability;
* Reducing the capital costs of land purchase and perhaps fencing to SANParks,
depending on how the agreements were finalised;
* Reducing the management and maintenance costs of the fence;
* Reducing the likelihood of the land being radically transformed by agriculture or
any other form of land use;
* Reducing social costs to SANParks; and
* Increasing diversity of eco-tourism product.
The private landowner could benefit by not entirely enclosing their property with a
game fence, and retaining open sections adjoining a neighbour or SANParks. The
private landowner would then be able to gain access to certain game species, such
as buffalo and black rhino, which are very expensive and probably unobtainable.
Increased land size would also make the area suitable for species such as lion,
elephant and wild dog, which cannot normally be kept on properties of less than 10
000 hectares.
Commercialisation, where private developers and operators are given the right to
operate within Schedule 1 National Parks, is a process SANParks has recently
adopted. It is financially attractive for SANParks (and fully supported by the national
government) to pursue this route, and should be stated as a management strategy.
Activities such as open game drives at the existing Addo camp, restaurants and
shops can be outsourced to private operators under mutually beneficial agreements.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                 113



Coastal & Environmental Services
It is possible that there are many other activities which could similarly be outsourced.
These could include boat trips to the islands off the Woody Cape coast or
surrounding area, game-capture operations, cleaning and maintenance of the
SANParks tourism camps, garden maintenance, gate security, etc. These could be
structured in such a way that small medium and micro enterprises (SMMEs) could
operate many of these activities. Other activities could include the fence patrol, fence
maintenance (clearing vegetation on the electric fence), basic road maintenance,
alien plant clearing and vehicle maintenance, etc.
9.1.2 COMMUNITIES
Local communities must be integrated into the project if it is achieve the wider
economic benefits discussed.in this SEA. This can be developed through Park
Committees and other forums. SANParks will need to play an active role in this
regard, ensuring that communities gain access to the benefits created by the park
and the private partners.
Communities can play a very important role within the gAENP, and probably their
most important one is participating on the local management boards required in the
development of management plans. Local communities can ensure that plans and
policies for the park are structured in such a way that at least some of their needs
and aspirations can be met through the establishment of communication forums
between the park and their communities.
Other management options relate to SANParks initiating training sessions e.g. in the
hospitality industry, thereby preparing community members for these functions. This
will enable local people to gain employment and experience, and hopefully be in a
position to one day manage or own their own operation.
In addition, formal arrangements with surrounding communities could be developed
to empower these communities and effectively increase the size of the park.
Although no communal land lies within the currently proposed 'footprint' for the
gAENP, interest has been shown in one communal area around the Enon Mission,
which adjoins the proposed boundary. Discussions are in the early stages, but it is
clear that the owners collectively do not wish to sell the land, but might be in favour
of some form of contractual agreement. A model that is being looked at is that of
Community Conservation Areas (CCAs), or Community Conservation Game
Reserves (CCGRs) as they are now called, as used in the Rictersveld National Park.
9.2 WHAT MANAGEMENT SCENARIOS HAVE BEEN
SUGGESTED?
Two contrasting management scenarios, out of innumerable possibilities, have been
examined. The first of these is one where the predominant area (70%) is under
Schedule 1 ownership, and the second where the predominant area (again 70%) is
managed as a contractual park.
These scenarios are examined by making some predictions as to how the two
proposed key management structures, the Park Management Committee and the
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL               114



Coastal & Environmental Services
Park Steering Committee (section 7.7 and Specialist Report 12), might be expected
to perform under each scenario.
9.2.1 70% SCHEDULE I - 30% CONTRACTUAL
In this scenario the main responsibility for management is vested in SANParks, who
would have full authority over the majority of the park, with specific responsibilities,
according to the precise nature and conditions of the contractual agreements, over
the rest. The degree of control they would be able to exercise over activities within
the park would be considerable, and they would clearly be the dominant presence in
any management forum.
The Park Management Committee, however, would comprise representatives from a
wide range of interest groups and institutions operating outside the confines of the
park or the authority of SANParks.
The Park Steering Committee, dealing with the more practical aspects of day-to-day
management, would probably function most effectively with the bias towards
Schedule 1 ownership, as the management of game, vegetation, and all other
biological and cultural features of the park would mostly apply on land in SANParks
ownership.
9.2.2 70% CONTRACTUAL - 30% SCHEDULE I
Here, although the legal responsibility for management of the park would continue to
reside with SANParks, the reality of management 'on the ground' could be very
different. Again, it would seem that the Park Management Committee's (PMC)
function and performance may not be particularly affected, although it may prove
something of a challenge for SANParks to convey to the other members the
constraints on their autonomy of management over the area resulting from a
preponderance of contractual land. Other ramifications include the almost inevitable
increase in competition for tourism benefits between the contractual landowners
themselves, and between them and the concessions within the Schedule 1 area.
This is likely to impact not only on the park management, but also on the
performance of the PMC.
Within the Park Steering Committee (PSC), depending on its composition in terms of
the representation of contractual landowners, the balance of influence is likely to shift
away from SANParks. This could impact quite seriously on discussions concerning
activities affecting the density and movement of game within the gAENP. A corollary
of the increased competition for tourism benefits could be the desire by each
contractual landowner for concentrations of game in 'their' area. The holders of
concessions within the park are also likely to have similar demands, particularly as
SANParks do not intend to grant 'exclusive access' rights over large areas of the
-park to concessionaires. Management of the PSC under these conditions could
prove very challenging.
Not surprisingly perhaps, the first scenario, with the preponderance of land under
Schedule 1 ownership and management, would appear to present the most
favourable option in terms of not only the management of the gAENP, but also the
effectiveness of the two proposed management structures. It should be emphasised
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                115



Coastal & Environmental Services
that the benefits of a national park in the international sense are great and
management therefore needs to reside largely with SANParks for its long term
security and international acceptance. The principles driving private enterprise are
largely financial, and are thus very often in conflict with basic conservation principles.
Thus, ideally the bulk of the area or key conservation and attraction areas need to be
under SANParks' control, around which contractual areas can hinge.
9.3 WHAT TOURISM OPTIONS HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED?
The gAENP offers a wide range of eco-tourism opportunities due to its geographic
location, its associated landscapes, wildlife and biological importance and
uniqueness. The tourism opportunities are differentiated into different products
catering for different markets. For example, it is the only park in Africa to offer a truly
Big 7 experience in addition to biodiversity par excellence.
1.   Coastal Areas, where open water activities e.g. boat trips, whale and shark
watching, fishing and diving are possibilities and along the coastline, whale
watching, hiking, fishing and general recreation. Unique island experiences
(birds, penguins, seals) would be exclusive experiences. Walking, nature
based activities and overnight accommodation are suitable for the
neighbouring forests. Exposure to the world's largest coastal dunefield is
another unique tourist experience.
2.   The Thicket Areas are ideal for Big 5 tourism, with hunting in some areas
The Zuurberg Mountains offer excellent opportunities for hiking, 4x4 trails
and possibly some fishing, game-viewing and hunting.
3.   The Savanna Areas, especially behind the dune system, offer a wide range
of opportunities. The most important of these will probably include Big 5 eco-
tourism and possibly hunting. Activities of a lesser importance include
hiking, walking and 4x4 trails in the less accessible areas, while there are
limited opportunities for fishing along certain sections of the river.
4.   The Karoo Area has good potential for Big 5 game-viewing and associated
hunting, while Darlington Dam offers opportunities for water-based activities
that includes some of the best fresh-water fishing available. Hiking and 4x4
trails may be possible especially in the mountains.
The majority of these activities are mutually exclusive and some, such as hunting or
even fishing in the coastal zone, are not permitted in national parks or marine
reserves under the present NPA, which is under review. These opportunities have
been presented merely to indicate the possibilities that exist, and in order to provide
a framework for developing different ecotourism models. Table 9.3a summarises
these opportunities and broadly quantifies them on a scale from 0 to 5, where zero is
totally unsuited, and 5 indicates that the area is considered to be perfectly suited for
the activity.
22Hunting can only be allowed in Schedule 2 areas.

A wide range of products can be offered, which can range from mass recreation,
where access or user fees are relatively cheap, to exclusive access, where user
costs are likely to be high. Equally, the public or private sector, or a combination can
supply these products, where funding, management, marketing and operations are
undertaken by a combination of private or public sector operators.
Applying these alternative approaches to the different products will lead to a wide
range of permutations, but are limited to those that are most likely to be in
agreement with current SANParks policies. Permissible activities were also
determined in accordance with prevailing attitudes, gleaned from interviews with
SANParks staff, stakeholders and internal reports.
SANParks is committed to making at least some of the products financially
accessible to most South Africans (Knight & Castley, 1999). This would therefore
tend to suggest that for many of the products, the emphasis must be on affordable
tourism, where self-guided access is the norm, although guided access would
provide a higher income for SANParks and greater benefit to the tourist and
conservation goals (Table 9.3b). However, this form of eco-tourism can be further
divided into self-guided access for some visitors, with guided activities for those that
can afford the extra costs. In some instances, there is a trade-off between what the
public pays to use a facility, the number of jobs created and overall viability. It is
assumed that it is not the intention of SANParks to directly subsidise any tourism
activities, except environmental education for special groups. All other tourism
activities must at least cover operational expenses with income generated from the
wide array of tourism products. Some cross-subsidisation may therefore be
acceptable, but not at the direct expense of biodiversity conservation.

10. CONCLUSIONS
Information from the current studies indicates that conservation of the biodiversity
within the gAENP would be a sustainable and economically viable form of land use
for the planning domain.
The conservation of this area will be a more sustainable land use than the current
situation, as much of the land has been or is under increasing threat of being
degraded as a result of intensive farming methods. Protecting the unique biodiversity
of the area holds numerous opportunities e.g:
* Meeting international and national conservation responsibilities and obligations.
. Eco-tourism opportunities and eco-tourism spin-offs serving as an economic
generator for SANParks, Eastern Cape and South Africa.
. Eco-tourism has limited costs to the environment compared with intensive
farming.
* Preservation of Red Data Species.
* Research opportunities.
* Protection of unknown medicinal plants.
* Opportunities for social and financial upliftment of the local communities.
The gAENP contains a sufficiently large area to include critical terrestrial and aquatic
natural processes (biotic and abiotic) to ensure long term ecological sustainability of
the natural environment. The gAENP will also conserve representatives of a wide
range of landscapes, terrestrial biomes and aquatic systems.
The area has a unique combination of features affording it a high eco-tourism
potential, which has been relatively unexploited. The South African government has
recognised the importance of eco-tourism as an economic contributor and has stated
that its target for GDP generation from tourism is 10%. The National Department of
Environmental Affairs and Tourism has identified the Eastern Cape, with its mix of
nature-based, wildlife, historical and cultural tourism, as having significant eco-
tourism potential.
The AENP has proved to be a highly lucrative tourist destination, and with an
expansion and diversification of tourist-related experiences, the gAENP will cater for
a greater number and a wider variety of tourists. Its increasing attraction is evident in
the 8% increase in tourists per annum, 50% of which are foreigners, more than the
proportion visiting the Kruger National Park.
This is seen as important since the agricultural sector, a major contributor to the
province's GGP, is an unstable sector and the diversification of economic
opportunities through the introduction of eco-tourism will create a more stable
economic situation. The lack of comprehensive tourism  data is, however, a
constraint as the market is unknown. Since tourism does not fall into a sector on its
own, it is difficult to determine the economic contribution made by tourism.
A programme this size also has negative consequences. Most importantly it will
affect people living in the planning domain. The majority of the people are farm

labourers, and earn a minimal salary. However, they enjoy benefits associated with
living on farms and resettlement of these people remains a major constraint.
The lack of communication between SANParks and the affected communities,
especially the farmers, has created a feeling of mistrust between the affected
communities and SANParks. A lot of farmers are negative about the proposed
gAENP and many are not willing to sell their farms or even negotiate with SANParks.
The significant opportunities and constraints presented by the existing environment
for establishing the gAENP, and how the gAENP can optimise these opportunities
and mitigate the constraints are shown in the flow diagram below (Figure 10). As
shown in this diagram, most of the constraints presented by the environment can be
mitigated.

11. RECOMMENDATIONS
11.1 ADOPTED RECOMMENDATIONS
SANParks has already accepted a number of recommendations that flowed from the
initial specialist studies. These recommendations have either already been
implemented or are in the process of being implemented:
11.1.1 RESTRUCTURING OF THE ADDO PLANNING FORUM (APF)
SANParks has initiated the recommended restructuring of the APF. Three sub-
committees have thus far been formed and at the most recent meeting of the APF, a
questionnaire was handed out to members to assess the functioning of the forum as
well as to give recommendations for improvements. The three sub-committees are
Environmental NGOs, Farmers and Communities. An additional sub-committee for
Business/Marketing has also now been selected. The APF has also become more
representative by including representatives for all the local governments affected by
the expansion programme. Department of Land Affairs has also come on board.
11.1.2 RESETTLEMENT POLICY FRAMEWORK
A comprehensive Resettlement Policy Framework has been compiled and is
available  on  the  greater  Addo  Elephant  National  Park  web  page,
www.addoelephantpark.com.
11.1.3 LAND ACQUISITION
It was recommended that all land acquisition be halted until the SEA has been
completed and a more definite boundary has been established.
SANParks, however, has currently been buying land with donor funds to consolidate
the existing conserved areas and all purchases have been on the willing seller -
willing buyer basis. SANParks is also in the process of developing a Land Acquisition
Policy to assist with land acquisition so that it does not have to be temporarily halted,
but at the same time can use the Poverty Relief and Working for Water programmes
to provide bridging finance for employment for any affected farm labourers while the
RAPs are developed. It has also been agreed with DLA, as an interim measure, for a
staff member of DLA to be present at negotiations with farmers to inform farm
workers of their rights.
11.1.4 BOUNDARY UNCERTAINTIES
The boundary of the gAENP will never be finalised as there will always be
opportunities for expansion. The C-Plan, however, has determined priority areas to
purchase for conservation purposes, which will also be firmed up with the completion
of a land acquisition policy.
11.1.5 COMMUNICATION STRATEGY
SANParks is in the process of developing a comprehensive communications strategy
(section 5.5.4), which will assist in communication between SANParks and all
affected stakeholders. The draft communication strategy is available upon request
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                 122



Coastal & Environmental Services
from South African National Parks (Port Elizabeth office). SANParks is in the process
of restructuring the Addo Planning Forum, as has been recommended (section 7.7).
11.1.6 ENVIRONMENTAL AND RESETTLEMENT MANAGEMENT DURING
IMPLEMENTATION OF GAENP
SANParks will manage environmental and resettlement matters during creation of the
gAENP according to South African or World Bank requirements, whichever is the
more stringent. Resettlement and land acquisition will be managed in accordance
with the Resettlement Policy Framework as outlined in Section 11.1.2 and 11.1.3
above. The environmental assessment and management of physical investments in
the gAENP will be undertaken to meet South African and World Bank requirements
as specified in Appendix 4.
11.2 ADDITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS
11.2.1 TOURISM SURVEY
Since ecotourism will be the primary economic activity of the gAENP, in-depth market
research and marketing campaigns must be conducted. The research should
investigate the existing as well as the potential tourism opportunities of the proposed
planning domain, as well as the Eastern Cape.
11.2.2 FINANCIAL ASSESSMENT OF THE EXISTING FINANCIALLY VIABLE
FARMING AREAS
Kommadagga forms part of Somerset East, which is the biggest mohair producing
area in the world. The Glenconner and Kleinpoort area forms part of the
Karoo/Midlands, which is known to contribute 60% towards the international
production of mohair. A concern has been expressed regarding the impact that the
loss of mohair production would have on the local, regional and national economies
and on the supply of mohair.
It is thus recommended that the local, regional and national impact of the loss of
mohair production in these areas be investigated as part of a more detailed economic
assessment.

TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE PREPARATION OF A
RESETTLEMENT POLICY FRAMEWORK INCLUDING AN
INCOME RESTORATION PLAN FOR GREATER ADDO
ELEPHANT NATIONAL PARK
1. OBJECTIVE
To prepare a Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) in accordance with World Bank
guidelines as set out in their OP 4.12 (January 2002). The document must be
complete by mid June 2002. The purpose of the framework is to clarify resettlement
principles, organisational arrangements and design criteria to be applied to the
project during its implementation. The RPF would also include income restoration
information and planning for the priority affected farms.
2. TASK OUTLINE
The following tasks would be required to generate the RPF.
3. REVIEW OF DOCUMENTATION AND PROJECT OUTLINE
A broad overview of resettlement issues and suggested polices has bee prepared as
part of the strategic environmental assessment (see Specialist Report No 7;
Resettlement Framework: Strategic Environmental Assessment of the Greater Addo
Elephant National Park, CES, 2002). This report is constrained by the fact that the
"boundaries of the proposed GAENP have not yet been determined and secondly
such demographic data was not available at the time of writing" (Specialist Report No
7 pg 3).
At a project workshop on 31 January 2001 it was decided to generate a likely
implementation strategy and to represent this spatially. The map that would
accompany this spatial representation and the mooted implementation strategy that
would accompany this would mrake up the framework that would inform this RPF.
This map and accompanying strategy would be generated by 20 February 2002.
Receipt and review of this information would launch production of RPF.
Milestone: Receipt of mapping and strategy. Responsibility = SANParks to be
delivered by 22 Feb 2002.
4. PREPARATION WORKSHOP
On receipt of the map and accompanying strategy a workshop among the principles
(SANParks, World Bank and Consultants) is mooted. The workshop would examine
the project description and agree the details of the RFP preparation and
accompanying fieldwork. The workshop would also discuss the principles mooted in
Specialist Report No. 7 and discuss their suitability to the RFP.
Milestone: Workshop. Responsibility for co-ordination = consultant. Date suggested
February 26 2002.
5. DATA COLLECTION
Data collection would be required to firm up on key aspects as required by the RPF.
In particular these would be:
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                  128



Coastal & Environmental Services
(a) Negotiation of access. This is critical, as the study would now require fairly
detailed socio-economic information form a base line survey. Access to the
farms would have to be negotiated through the relevant channels.
(b) Collection and review of demographic data. This would come out of the available
census data (as adjusted). Data would be acquired at EA level and married to
GIS where possible. Demographic data would be cross-checked with more
recent analysis where this is available. Potential sources of the information
would be local governments Integrated Development Plans (IDP) and the
Demarcation Board database.
(c) Farm interviews. For the purposes of working up resettlement costs and in terms
of generating data it is proposed, that the priority farms for incorporation be
visited. Interviews of farmers and labourers to generate a profile of the number
of people affected and assets to be acquired would accompany visits to these
farms.
(d) Arising out of the farm interviews would be an assessment of incomes and
livelihoods. This would be critical to generating the income restoration plans for
the resettlement document.
(e) Legal review. In particular the implications of the Extension of Security of Tenure
Act needs to be examined in terms of national government delineation of
responsibility for resettlement of farm workers.
(f) Collection of national and provincial government information of "valuation of
resources". In particular the Department of Agricultures and Public Works
current list of valuation and valuation procedures would need to be acquired.
This is critical for costing.
(g) Consultative mechanisms. An overview of existing stakeholders and their
representatives needs to be generated. This would serve to inform the
consultative approach.
(h) Information should be acquired on people who have been affected by acquisition
of farms post 1997 to date.
(i) Detailed data base of all visits to be compiled for future reference and GIS map
to be produced.
Milestone: Collection of all relevant data. Responsibility = Consultant. Date for
completion = 1 May 2002.
6. REVIEW WORKSHOP
A Review Workshop among the principles (SANParks, World Bank and Consultants)
is mooted. The workshop would review the document as prepared and deliberate
upon its contents and give comment.
Milestone: Workshop. Responsibility = Consultant. Date for completion = 2 May
7. REPORT WRITING
The report would be writing in accordance with the format suggested in the table of
contents below. It should be noted that the report would constitute a RFP but
would be amended to incorporate income restoration plans for priority farms. It
would also include recommendations as to how the resettlement actions plans that
might need to follow the RFP should be set out.
Milestone: Writing up of all relevant data. Responsibility = Consultant. Date for
completion = 31 May.

STRATEGIC FRAMEWORK FOR THE CONSERVATION
OF CULTURAL RESOURCES IN gAENP
1.   BACKGROUND TO THE AREA
The SANParks, in keeping with its corporate Cultural Resources Management Policy
(CRM) and desire to comply with South African cultural heritage legislation has
selected to produce a Strategic Framework for the Conservation of Cultural
Resources in the area of the gAENP. Further, as a precautionary principle, rather
than a necessity, an initial desktop cultural resources inventory is in the process of
being compiled. Whilst parts of the area in which the GAENP proposal is found are
known to contain important rock art, fossils and artifacts none of these resources are
threatened by, the GAENP proposal. Therefore, whilst World Bank safeguard policy
for Cultural Resources, OPN 11.03 and OP 4.11, is triggered by virtue of the
presence of cultural property in the area, the beneficial land use impact of the gAENP
proposal, South African heritage legislation, SANParks CRM Policy, the gAENP
Cultural Resources Framework discussed below, together with the compilation of a
cultural resources inventory, result in compliance with OPN 11.03.
In the southeastern portion of the gAENP, the Alexandria Dune Field Area is
considered by the South African authorities to have World Heritage Status.
Motivations in this regard have been made to UNESCO. It is anticipated some
heritage sites found in gAENP will be of National importance while others have
regional and local significance. SAHRA (South African Heritage Resources Agency)
and/or the local Provincial Heritage Authority will be involved in the determination of
significance in 'consultation with experts.
It is clear that the proposed extent of the gAENP encompasses an area with
significant heritage resources. In 1996, a small dinosaur called Nqwebasaurus thwazi
(Kirky) was discovered near Kirkwood, while the very first dinosaur to be identified in
South Africa was discovered on the Bushman's River (on the edge of the Park) in
1845. Archaeologically, the area includes extensive evidence of Khoisan settlement
in the past. This is reflected in the shell middens on the Alexandria coast, the rock art
of the Zuurberg and the stone cairns found along the Sunday's River.
The proposed area of the gAENP also has many important historic connections.
Early traveler's accounts provide information on the old wagon paths and the history
of early elephant (and game) hunting. The settlement of the region by Xhosa-
speakers and Europeans is reflected in the old farmhouses, mission stations,
cemeteries and villages. There are early frontier posts associated with the successive
Wars of Dispossession (Frontier Wars) also some activity related to the South African
War (Anglo Boer).
2.   WORLD BANK SAFEGUARD POLICIES - OPN 11.03
The main objective of OPN 4.11 is to ensure that Bank supported projects avoid,
minimize and mitigate the risks associated with the possible loss of cultural
resources. OPN 11.03 uses the United Nations definition of cultural property" to
include sites having archaeological (prehistoric), paleontological, historical, religious,
and unique natural values. Cultural property, therefore, encompasses both remains.
left by previous human inhabitants (for example, middens, shrines, and
battlegrounds) and unique natural environmental features such as canyons

Coastal & Environmental Services
Therefore, where such features exist as in the case of the gAENP proposal, OPN
4.11 is triggered and needs to be complied with.
3.    THE SANPARKS CULTURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (CRM)
POLICY
The conservation of heritage resources in the gAENP is of importance. It is therefore
praiseworthy that SANParks has committed itself to the conservation of heritage
resources in its Parks (see Policy Guidelines for Cultural Resource Management in
National Parks). In this policy document SANParks accepts responsibility for the
'effective protection, preservation and sustainable utilisation of cultural resources and
explicitly commits itself to the 'their integration into the development planning process
as well as park management.
4.    CULTURAL RESOURCES MAPPING OF THE gAENP
The Albany Museum has been contracted to undertake a first-phase cultural
(archaeological, palaeontological, anthropological and historical) mapping exercise of
the gAENP. In addition to the physical description; information on significance, key
management issues, potential impact and recommendations for mitigation (if these
are adverse) and conservation objectives will be addressed.
The survey has commenced and the heritage resources will be catalogued on
Microsoft Access. The database will be constructed in such a way that it can be
constantly updated as new sites are discovered. It is envisaged that the database
may be integrated within the GIS system for the Park, making it a valuable tool in the
management of heritage resources in the Park.
5.    LEGAL ISSUES
All heritage resources within the gAENP fall under the National Heritage Resources
Act (1999). The Act provides the general principles for governing the management of
heritage resources. It provides for an integrated system for the identification,
assessment and management of heritage resources; sets norms and standards for
the management of heritage resources and empowers civil society to conserve their
own heritage resources so that they may be preserved for future generations. The
Act will form the basis of the management recommendations flowing out of the
specialist study.
The key implications of this legislation for the gAENP area are as follows:
* The regulation of National Heritage (Monument) sites is generally a Provincial
Government function. However, when significant sites are adopted as National
Heritage Sites they will fall under the jurisdiction of the national regulatory body
SAHRA. Shipwrecks are also deemed the responsibility of SAHRA.
*  SAHRA needs to authorise the sale of pictures of National Heritage Sites.
* Structures older than 60 years may not be altered or demolished without a permit
from SAHRA.
* All archaeological material and remains of human activity (which are older than
100 years) and palaeontological sites as well as meteorites are protected by the
Act.
. Burial grounds and graves are afforded particular protection and a permit to
exhume a grave or demolish a cemetary/grave will not be granted if detailed
TIhe gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                136



Coastal & Environmental Services
efforts are not made to contact and consult communities and individuals who
have an interest in the cemetery/grave concerned.
The Act makes provision for the protection of Living Heritage and also defines
Heritage Objects. It allows for the restitution of heritage objects to communities,
which may claim them.
SANParks is taking the necessary measure to ensure compliance with the Act.
6.    MITIGATION MEASURES
The main mitigation measures will include:
* the adoption of the proposed cultural heritage data base to ensure that small
works are built away from sites of cultural heritage importance
* the updating of the data base as a planning instrument as new data becomes
available
* the training of staff on cultural resources identification and management including
reporting procedures on new finds.
In the event that an impact cannot be avoided the requirements of SAHRA will be
complied with and where needed a mitigation plan will be produced by a reputable
specialist.
7.    RECOMMENDATIONS
. A basic training programme for staff in the identification, management and
reporting procedures of heritage resources.
. To appoint a staff member to update and maintain the cultural resources
database as new heritage resources are discovered.
* To integrate the management of the database and cultural resources as a part of
the gAENP environmental management system which is about to be adopted.
Therefore, whilst World Bank safeguard policy for Cultural Resources, OPN 11.03
and OP 4.1 1, is triggered by virtue of the presence of cultural property in the area,
the beneficial land use impact of the gAENP proposal, South African heritage
legislation, SANParks CRM Policy, the gAENP Cultural Resources Framework
discussed below, together with the compilation of a cultural resources inventory,
result in compliance with OPN 11.03.

PHYSICAL INVESTMENTS IN THE gAENP

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF
PHYSICAL INVESTMENTS IN THE gAENP
1.    BACKGROUND
The gAENP project objectives are to achieve a number of positive environmental,
socioeconomic and developmental impacts from investments to conserve nationally
and globally important biodiversity in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems. A
Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) has been undertaken to meet World
Bank EA requirements.
The gAENP project is proposing a number of site-level investments to help achieve
the longer-term park development, biodiversity conservation and socioeconomic
goals. These investments are not on a large scale, and typical environmental impacts
and normal mitigation measures are well-known in South Africa. For the terrestrial
components, these investments include development of gates, fencing, road
upgrading, water provision, new tourist camps, improving heritage sites, installing
waste management systems, vegetation rehabilitation, removing invasive alien
species, and re-introducing certain species back into the park ecosystem. For the
proposed marine component, site-level investments mainly focus on developing
infrastructure for marine tours (jetty, ablutions, kiosk, tourism centre and parking).
These physical investments will be subject to the EA requirements of both South
Africa and the World Bank. Funds have been allocated through the project (from
SANParks contribution) to cover the EA cost as well as development of
Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for each major package of investments.
It is expected that SANParks will aggregate site-level investments into larger
packages to minimize the transaction costs for obtaining EA authorization, and for
managing construction and the implementation of EMPs.
The South African EA requirements substantially address those of the World Bank
and will normally be sufficient to meet the latter's needs. At the same time, there are
some small differences in both process and content as outlined in Section 3 below.
Consequently, a gAENP environmental assessment and management process is
specified in Section 2 below that, when required, augments the RSA requirements to
also meet World Bank requirements. SANParks will ensure that this process is
applied to all physical investments proposed under the gAENP project.
In addition to World Bank policies on environmental assessment (OP/BP 4.01) and
the management of cultural resources (OP 4.11), gAENP also triggers the Bank's
resettlement policy (OP/BP 4.12). Project requirements under OP/BP 4.12 are being
addressed through a separate Resettlement Policy Framework. gAENP does not
trigger the Bank's indigenous peoples policy (OD 4.20) or other safeguards policies.
2.    ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT OF PHYSICAL
WORKS FUNDED BY THE GAENP PROJECT
SANParks will follow the RSA EA process to obtain authorisation for physical
investments under the GAENP project. Whenever this process calls for a decision by
the relevant Provincial authority, SANParks will also submit the appropriate
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                  139



Coastal & Environmental Services
document(s) for review by the World Bank. A decision of the Provincial authority,
with additional conditions if necessary, must be satisfactory to the World Bank before
the proposed physical investments can be accepted for financing by the GAENP
project.
All packages of physical investments in GAENP that are authorised through the RSA
EA process will have an associated Environmental Management Plan (EMP). The
content of an EMP will vary in scope and depth to suit the needs of the investment
proposal.  It may range from  simple housekeeping measures (e.g. waste
management, control of construction traffic and dust) to more substantial measures
to address potentially significant adverse impacts.  Guidance on World Bank
requirements for an EMP can be found in its EA Sourcebook Update No. 25 of
January 1999. In summary, an EMP must:
* Identify and briefly summarize the predicted adverse environmental and social
impacts for which mitigation is required;
. Identify feasible and cost-effective measures to reduce potentially significant
adverse environmental and social impacts to acceptable levels;
* Describe the monitoring program designed to ensure that mitigation measures
are implemented, have the intended result, and that remedial measures are
undertaken if mitigation measures are inadequate or potential impacts have been
underestimated;
. Clearly define the institutional arrangements, roles and responsibilities for
implementing mitigation and monitoring, and the arrangements for coordination
between the various actors responsible for mitigation;
. Specify the implementation schedule and reporting procedures related to the
timing, frequency, and duration of mitigation measures, showing links with the
overall project implementation plan;
* Specify any training required for personnel involved in implementing the EMP;
and
• Specify cost estimates and sources of funds for both the initial investment and
recurring expenses for implementing all measures contained in the EMP,
including training, integrated into the total project costs.
Small amounts of herbicides will be used to prevent the regrowth of invasive alien
vegetation, and SANParks will be abiding by the Working For Water Policy on the
Use of Herbicides for the Control of Alien Vegetation in these situations. Where
herbicides will be used, the relevant EMP will document the herbicides to be used
and SANParks' commitment to fulfilling the requirements of this policy and the
requirements of the Bank's OP 4.09 Pest Management.
All EMPs must be satisfactory to the World Bank before the proposed physical
investments can be accepted for financing by the GAENP project.
EA studies, and EMPs, will consider at least the full range of environmental concerns
identified under World Bank EA OP 4.01 -- the natural environment; human health

Coastal & Environmental Services
and safety; cultural property23; and transboundary and global environmental
aspects
As EMPs are implemented, SANParks will conduct an annual review of EMP
performance, with a focus on lessons learned and any measures needed to improve
performance, and provide the review(s) to the World Bank.
3.    COMPARISION OF ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT REQUIREMENTS
OF THE WORLD BANK AND THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA
3.1   South Africa
3.1.1 Legal, Regulatory and Institutional Framework
South Africa has a long history of legal and institutional support for environmental
management. The three most critical pieces of South African environmental
legislation are the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa (1996); the National
Environmental Management Act (NEMA 1998); and the Environment Conservation
Act (ECA 1989). The ECA represented a major step forward to consolidate legislation
governing protection and control over the environment. A number of provisions dealt
with protected areas and natural resources, waste management and pollution,
general regulatory powers and provisions for dealing with offences and penalties.
The Constitution enshrined the fundamental right of every person to an
environment...."which is not detrimental to his/her health or well-being." The
environment would be protected for the benefit of present and future generations
through legislative and other measures that would prevent pollution and economical
degradation,  promote  conservation,  and  secure  ecologically  sustainable
development. The NEMA strengthened a number of statutes under the old ECA. The
NEMA provides broad principles for national environmental management; outlines
new environmental institutions (National Environmental Advisory Forum, and
Committee for Environmental Coordination); procedures for cooperative governance,
decision making and conflict management; outlines the principle of integrated
environmental management; specifies international obligations and agreements;
provides guidance on compliance and enforcement; environmental management
cooperation agreements; and administration of the Act.
The 1989 ECA provided a framework for a compulsory environmental impact
assessment (EIA) , however government resisted a legislative basis and continued
to support EIA as a voluntary planning tool. The 1992 Guidelines for Integrated
Environmental Management emphasised the importance of EIA as a mechanism for
incorporating environmental factors into planning and development but the process
remained outside existing legislation.  In 1994, draft regulations for EIA were
published and a lengthy consultative process was initiated in 1995. Revised EIA
regulations were published in 1996 for public comment. In September 1997, the
23 The United Nations term "cultural property" includes sites having archeological (prehistoric),
paleontological, historical, religious, and unique natural values. Cultural property, therefore,
encompasses both remains left by previous human inhabitants (for example, middens, shrines, and
battlegrounds) and unique natural environmental features such as canyons and waterfalls.
24 Climate change, ozone-depleting substances, pollution of international waters, and adverse impacts
on biodiversity.
25 South Africa uses the term EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment) while the Bank uses EA
(Environmental Assessment). The two terms are essentially interchangeable.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                    141



Coastal & Environmental Services
Minister of the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT)
promulgated regulations under the Environment Conservation Act (ECA) to require
compulsory EIA. Guidelines for EIA were released in April 1998 while the NEMA was
being formulated. When the NEMA was promulgated in November 1998, the existing
EIA regulations were incorporated. The EIA regulations have been subject to minor
modifications since 1998, the most recent in May 2002. For the most part, the
amendments tighten up wording in the regulations, and clarify prescribed activities.
The DEAT is the competent authority with respect for implementing the NEMA.
Intergovernmental coordination is through the Committee for Environmental
Coordination, while the Minister is advised by the National Environmental Advisory
Forum.
3.1.2 The EIA Process in South Africa
The South African EIA process has the following main steps:
a) When an activity prescribed by the ECA is proposed, the project proponent must
either make an application for authorization to the relevant Provincial authority, or
seek exemption from compliance with the EIA regulations26. If an exemption is
not granted, the Provincial authority either requires a Scoping Report or a plan for
preparing a Scoping Report. The plan must be approved by the authority. A
Scoping Report must identify how the environment might be affected, what
environmental issues are involved, what the project alternatives are, and how the
public will be consulted.
b) The proponent then prepares the Scoping Report, involving the public, and
submits it to the Provincial authority for approval. In a number of provinces, it has
become practise for the Scoping Report to include an analysis of potential
impacts, proposed mitigation and monitoring measures, and an EMP.
c) Based on the Scoping Report, the Provincial authority then authorizes the project
with or without conditions, refuses the application, or determines that a full EIA
must be undertaken. It issues a formal Record of Decision.
d) If required, a full EIA is then produced and provided to the authority for a decision.
The authority either authorises the project with or without conditions, or refuses
the application. It issues a formal Record of Decision.
3.2   The World Bank
World Bank requirements for environmental assessment (EA) are specified in OP/BP
4.01 on Environmental Assessment, supported by the EA Sourcebook and Updates.
Since GAENP involves the management of cultural resources, OP 4.11 on Cultural
Property also applies. The requirements of OP 4.11 are normally addressed within
the EA process specified under OP/BP 4.01. EA documents are prepared by the
Borrower. They must be approved by the Bank and disclosed to the public before the
project is allowed to proceed to appraisal in preparation for negotiations and approval
by the Board.
3.3   Compatibility of Bank and RSA Requirements for EA
26 In Gauteng Province, for example, exemptions are sought via a "Pre-Application/EIA Exemption
Checklist" that describes the project, the existing land uses and environmental sensitivities, expected
solid waste and effluent generation, and required permits under other legislation.
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                  142



Coastal & Environmental Services
3.3.1 Screening and Scoping
At the project level, both processes currently require an initial environmental
screening to determine the need for and scope of further environmental assessment.
The Bank assigns a proposed project to one of three categories to prescribe the
appropriate level of assessment (A: full EA; B: partial EA; C: no EA). Projects in
certain sectors or of certain types are normally categorized as shown in Table 1.
These examples are illustrative only. Categorization is not a function of the type or
scale of project, but of the location and sensitivity of environmental issues and the
nature and magnitude of potential environmental impacts. For projects requiring a
partial or full EA, an initial scoping and ongoing public consultation are part of the
preparation of the EA report.
In South Africa, a proponent must first submit an application for authorization to
undertake an activity prescribed by the ECA (Table 1). The application is reviewed by
the Provincial environment authority and a decision is then made to either require a
Scoping Report or a plan of study to complete such a report. In the latter case, the
authority must approve the plan before preparation of the report can begin.
Table 1 indicates a close correlations between the two screening lists. The two gaps
in the South African list are mining and resettlement. For the purposes of the
GAENP project, mining is not a consideration. Resettlement issues will be managed
through a Resettlement Policy Framework prepared according to the requirements of
the World Bank resettlement policy OP/BP 4.12.

In terms of scoping the issues that are to be addressed in an EA study, there may be
minor differences between Bank and South African requirements. For example, the
NEMA of RSA defines "environment" to mean the surroundings within which humans
exist that are made up of:
(i)  the land, water and atmosphere of the earth;
(ii)  microorganisms, plant and animal life;
The gAENP Strategic Environmental Assessment: FINAL                  144



Coastal & Environmental Services
(iii)  any part or combination of (i) and (ii) and the interrelationships among and
between them; and
(iv)  the physical, chemical, aesthetic and cultural properties and conditions of the
foregoing that influence human health and wellbeing.
In its preamble, the NEMA also states a number of principles that project proponents
and decision makers need to take into account when undertaking EA:
(i)   The State must respect, protect, promote and fulfill the social, economic and
environmental rights of everyone and strive to meet the basic needs of
previously disadvantaged communities; and
(ii)  Sustainable development requires the integration of social, economic and
environmental factors in the planning, implementation and evaluation of
decisions to ensure that development serves present and future generations.
The World Bank broadly defines the scope of EA "take into account the natural
environment (air, water and land); human health and safety; social aspects
(involuntary resettlement, indigenous peoples, and cultural property); and
transboundary and global environmental aspects (e.g. climate change, ozone-
depleting substances, pollution of international waters, and adverse impacts on
biodiversity)." (OP 4.01).
There is considerable overlap in these prescriptions for the scope of EA studies. At
the same time, Scoping Reports and, if needed, consequent full ElAs, prepared to
meet RSA EA regulations will need to be cognisant of World Bank requirements in
order to satisfy the needs of both processes. For gAENP, involuntary resettlement
concerns will be addressed through a separate Resettlement Policy Framework, and
there are no indigenous peoples concerns within the meaning of World Bank policy
on the matter.
3.3.2 Consultation
Both the Bank and South Africa require public consultation for projects needing either
a full or partial EA (Bank) and Scoping Report and EIA (South Africa). The level of
consultation ranges from publishing notices of project intent and invitations to review
EIA reports, to full public hearings. With the South African process, the selection of
an appropriate public consultation instrument depends on the nature of the project
and what the provincial DEAT determines as minimum requirements. During scoping,
this may range from simply informing neighbors about the project and seeking input,
to holding public meetings with interested and affected parties, after publishing
notices about the project in various media. Interested and affected parties are also
given time to respond to the draft scoping report. If an EIA is then required under the
South African process, interested and affected parties must be given an opportunity
to provide input as well as comment on the draft EIA report. The proponent will first
present authorities with a plan of study for the EIA, which must include public
consultation mechanisms. The authorities will either approve the plan of study, or
request modifications including recommended public consultation processes to be
followed during the EIA.
The 1998 Bank EA Guidelines provide proponents with directions to identify
interested and affected parties relative to the project, and appropriate consultation
methods. The South African requirements for consultation are fully compatible with
Bank requirements.

Coastal & Environmental Services
3.3.3 Mitigation and Monitoring
The Bank EA process calls for a distinct environmental management plan (EMP) for
projects deemed to require a full or partial EA. These plans generally outline the
mitigation, monitoring, and institutional measures to be taken during project
implementation and operation to avoid or control adverse environmental impacts, and
the actions needed to implement these measures. The South African guidelines do
not require such an EMP. Instead, the EIA report must describe mitigation and
monitoring. The general requirements for an EMP (Bank) and EIA (South Africa) are
listed in Table 2.
Table 2 indicates that South Africa meets Bank requirements for specifying mitigation
and monitoring measures. However, the South African guidelines do not directly
specify an implementation schedule and reporting procedures, and do not address
training needs.

3.3.4 Conclusions
The South African EA process generally meets Bank requirements under OP/BP
4.01. While the processes operate in a slightly different manner, the main elements
of screening, scoping, report preparation, public consultation, mitigation and
monitoring are quite similar in content. The two processes offer essentially the same
level of independent authority over project approval. The apparent "gaps" between
the two are:
a)    Under World Bank OP/BP 4.01, all physical investments under the gAENP will
require either an EA containing an EMP, or just an EMP. Depending on the
nature of the investment, the South Africa process might not require a Scoping
Report or, if it does, a subsequent EIA, and an EMP as defined by the World
Bank may or may not be required;
