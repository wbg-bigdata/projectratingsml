FROM PLANNING TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A SUCCESSFUL CONSERVATION AND SOCIO-ECONOMIC MODEL   1
       EIGHT DECADES OF EXPERIENCE

       The Addo Elephant National Park (AENP) was originally
       proclaimed 80 years ago, on 2,270 hectares, in an effort
       to protect the region’s severely threatened elephants.
       The park’s management strategy has evolved over the
       decades from a single species conservation philosophy
       to one that embraces holistic biodiversity conservation
       and sustainable development. The evolution began
       during the 1970s and 1980s, in response to a need
       to expand the original conservation area to allow for
       sufficient boundary expansion to sustain the growing
       population of elephants. The park’s vision has further
       been expanded to accommodate a broader biodiversity
       focus as well as the re-introduction of key big species,
       which has resulted in the park now holding the title of
       the world’s first ‘Big Seven’ conservation area, home to
       elephants, lions, rhinos, buffalos and leopards, plus the
       southern right whale and the great white shark. Over
       time, the drive to conserve and effectively manage the
                                                                                 A Greater Kudu at the Addo Elephant National Park in South Africa.

          Stable Ecosystems are Good for Climate Resilience
         Stable and functioning ecosystems are necessary for sustainable development. Ecosystem services including, conserva-
         tion of biological diversity, provision of clean air and water, retention of soil and opportunities for carbon sequestra-
         tion, all contribute importantly to adaptation in the face of changing climate.

         Expansion of the AENP through the incorporation of continuous ecosystems within its perimeters is an important
         ecological approach to climate change mitigation and adaptation. The move away from land conversion to land
         conservation in the park has relieved the threat of historic unsustainable land use and degradation. The ‘ecological
         corridors’ created by the project have allowed elephants and other wildlife to roam across larger swathes of land in
         the AENP, thereby further reducing land degradation from grazing, as well as reducing reliance on artificial sources of
         drinking water. The park’s contiguous and diverse ecological areas open to tourism allow for a diversity of experiences,
         both terrestrial and marine. By opting to manage the park as one contiguous ecological zone, ongoing planning and
         management, and equitable distribution of positive economic gains, are addressed in a holistic manner with a view to
         ensuring the resilience of the park’s zones as a whole.

            Expansion Through Contractual Partnerships:
                      The Kuzuko Experience
   A series of public-private conservation partnerships have allowed the park to expand by an additional 30,000 hectares.
   Landowners sign long-term contractual agreements with SANParks, thereby bringing private land under the manage-
   ment of the park. While the contractual areas are managed in line with SANParks conservation policies, the private
   sector contractual partners are entitled to operate tourism enterprises on the land.

   The Kuzuko is a 15,000 ha game reserve adjacent to the AENP’s Darlington Section on the park’s northeast side.
   Located within the Blue Crane Route Municipality (BCRM), the land within the Kuzuko Contractual Area had
   in the past been used for small stock farming. Following establishment of the Contractual Area, the process toward
   rehabilitating the land began and, in partnership with SANParks, conservation programs centered on indigenous
   wildlife, including black rhinos and elephants. At the time of their re-introduction into Kuzuko, the black rhino and
   the elephant hadn’t occupied the karoo for 150 years.

   Kuzuko now offers tourists a world class safari experience and accommodations in a 5-star lodge managed by one of
   South Africa’s leading hotel groups, Legacy Hotels. Since its inception, the Kuzuko Contract Park has come to be
   viewed as the most significant contributor to the economy of the BCRM, thanks to enhanced tourism and the related
   businesses it has spawned, including bed and breakfasts. Indeed, in response to the positive economic influx generated
   by this contract park, the municipal government responded by building an airport in nearby Somerset East to better
   serve the region’s tourism trade.

         The Sundays River Valley is characterized by the thicket conservation zones of the AENP and high intensity irrigation
         farming. The Valley, with its vital water resources, plays an important role in the local economy of the Eastern Cape.

         The availability of fresh water resources in the region into the future is a significant concern, given the dual impact
         of projected warmer and drier climatic conditions on the sub-continent. Recently, the rivers of the Eastern Cape, the
         Sundays River included, had begun to face an important threat from the incursion of invasive alien vegetation. It was
         getting to the point where the Sundays River was often impassable due to the growth and spread of invasive plants.
         These, in turn, were contributing to dropping water tables, stagnation, silting and drying tributaries, with related
         negative effects on the fragile marine environment of the river and the estuary, and the economy.

         In response to the threats posed by invasive alien vegetation on the Sundays River system and the productive soil in
         the Valley, the Mayibuye Ndlovu Development Trust (MNDT) and the Sundays River Citrus Company (Pty) Ltd
         (SRCC), one of the largest packers and marketers of citrus fruit in southern Africa, launched a joint commercial initia-
         tive, the Mayibuye Ndlovu Compost project. The project sought not only to address the problem of invasives, but also
         to support sustainable agriculture and promote sustainable employment for people from surrounding communities.

         The MNDT supported the creation of two new local small, medium & micro enterprises (SMMEs) and raised ad-
         ditional project grant funding from the EU of R 4,700,000. The SMMEs, which following their creation became
         self-sustaining, harvest alien vegetation and process the raw material for compost manufacturing. This is then delivered
         to the SRCC, who uses the raw materials to manufacture organic compost which is then distributed to citrus growers
         and other commercial buyers in the region.

         The Mayibuye Ndlovu Compost project has contributed to a revitalization of the local environment and economy by
         providing opportunity for local communities to benefit financially from the removal of invasive alien vegetation, and
         serves as a benchmark for further future community development projects.
