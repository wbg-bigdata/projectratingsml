WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY
Borrower    .    Kingdom of Lesotho
Amount      :    US$6.0 million
Terms             Standard IDA
Project
Description:     The proposed project would provide for:  (i) construction
of water supply system extension in seven towns; (ii) tech-
nichal assistance; and (iii) engineering consulting
services. It would develop Lesotho's water resources;
strengthen sector institutions; and upgrade domestic water
supplies. The project would, by 1986, provide public water
service to some 20,000 new consumers who now rely on un-
protected sources and would improve reliability and quality
of water now supplied to about 21,000 current consumers.
In addition, the Project would strengthen a key Government
institution, the Water and Sewerage Branch (WSB) of the
Ministry of Works (MW). The project faces no unusual
risks. However, inadequate staffing may affect the rate
of project implementation. The risk has been minimized by
providing technical assistance under the project. In addi-
tion, a comprehensive training program to meet WSBts man-
power needs is being financed by the Government of the
Federal Republic of Germany.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED
CREDIT TO THE KINGDOM OF LESOTHO FOR
A WATER SUPPLY PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Kingdom of Lesotho for the equivalent of US$6.0
million on standard IDA terms for a water supply project.
PART I - THE ECONOMY 1/
2.        The most recent economic report entitled "Economic Memorandum on
Lesotho"(No. 2251-LSO) was distributed to the Executive Directors in
February 1979. A report (No. 1688-EA) which examined migration in southern
Africa, and in particular, the migrant 'Labor situation in Lesotho, was dis-
tributed to the Executive Directors in February 1978. Country data are shown
in Annex I.
3.        Lesotho is one of the UN-designated 'least developed' countries.
GNP per capita in 1977 was estimated at US$230. 2/ Completely landlocked by
the Republic of South Africa (RSA), the country is mountainous, soil erosion
is extensive, and less than 15 percent of its land area is suitable for crop
cultivation.  Population pressure on land resources is intense.  In 1977 the
population was estimated at 1.3 million, growing at 2.2 percent a year.
4.        Ihe economy is dominated by subsistence agriculture and by temporary
migration for employment, mainly in South African mines.  Subsistence agricul-
ture and livestock rearing are the main economic activities of about. 90 per-
cent of the resident population and account for about 40 percent of domestic
product.  The economy is also characterized by a critical dependence on South
Africa which accounts for (i) about 90 percent of Lesotho's merchandise trade
and tourist traff:ic; (ii) employment of about one-half of its male labor
force; (iii) migrant workers' remittances equivalent to about 60 percent of
the domestic product in 1977; and (iv) zustoms receipts from the Southern Africa
1/ Part I of this report is the same as Part I in Report No. P-2443a-LSO
on Lesotho Third Highway Project, scheduled to be considered by the
Executive Directors on March 13, 1979.
2/ GDP per capita was about US$125 in 1977. GNP substantially exceeds GDP
because of migrant workers' remittances.



- 2 -
Customs Union 1/ which account for almost 60 percent of total Government revenues,
The country's integration with the South African economy has also been bolstered
by its membership in the Rand Monetary Area and by the country's use of t1-.e South
African rand as its currency.
5.        While Lesotho's lack of natural. resources is a major constraint tD its
development, its unique migrant labor situation remains the Government's o03t
formidable problem. About 165,000 Basotho are estimated to be employed as.
migrant workers in South Africa; this contrasts sharply with only about 3K,00
in wage employment in the domestic economy. Since there are few opportun-.ties
for domestic earnings in Lesotho comparable to those in South African mincs,
rapidly rising mine wages in recent years have spurred even greater migration.
Between 1970 and 1977, the number of Basotho workers in the mines increased by
40,000 while domestic wage employment is estimated to have grown by Less t:han
10,000.
6.        Migration has provided substantial remittances which have become
critical to maintaining the living standards of a large segment of the poru--
lation; recent studies have shown that crop production now accounts for lEss
than 20 percent of rural household income. But continuing absence of suci a
large proportion of the country's able-bodied male population has contributEd
to (i) a donmestic shortage of skilled and semi-skilled manpower; and (ii) a
decline in agricultural production, both of which compound the problem of long-
term economic development. Furthermore, the country is vulnerable to develop-
ments affecting migration in South Africa over which the Lesotho Government
has no control. For example, increasing mechanization in South African mines
and recruitment trends from other supplying countries and within South Africa
itself (the proportion of black South African workers in mining has increasEd
from 24 percent in 1973 to 50 percent in 1977) are expected to reduce futur-e
demand for Basotho labor. With South Africa's policy of releasing migrant.
back into the Lesotho labor market the pressure on domestic employment may
rapidly increase. Desp:ite intensive research, the opportunities for creat:ng
additional employment in the agricultural sector seem to be too limited to meet
a rapidly growing demand for domestic employment.  In searching for altern..tives,
the Lesotho Government, in 1977 with IDA support under the Second Highway
Project, established a labor-intensive construction unit within the Minist:-:y
of Works, tc explore the economic and technical feasibility of labor-inten.ive
public works as a means of substantially increasing domestic employment.
Important lessons are being learned and on-the-job training is being provided
for local staff, who would expand the scope of labor-intensive operations as
needed in the future.
7.        Government development policy and programs as outlined in the Second
National Development Plan (1975/76-1979/80) are aimed at: (i) restoring the
viability of the agricultural sector; (ii) improving infrastructure, particu--
larly roads and communications between the mountain regions and the economically
1/ The Sout:hern Africa Customs Union was established in 1910 (and revised inL
1969 and 1976) among Botswana, Lesotho, South Africa and Swaziland. The
Agreement provides for free movement of goods among member cotntries, aaci
for revenue-sharing from a common pool of customs, excise and sales duties.



more developed lowlands; (iii) reforming the educational system to meet the
country's development needs; (iv) expanding the industrial base by strengthen-
ing the Lesotho National Development Corporation, the country's main channel
for industrial investment; and (v) generally reducing the country's economic
dependence on South Africa. The emphasis of the Plan is well directed to the
country's main development problems, and the investment pattern, giving priority
to agriculture, infrastructure and education, reflects the basic needs of an
economy still at a very early stage of development.
8.        Recent economic growth has been satisfactory, despite sharp fluctua-
tions in agricultural output mainly because of unfavorable weather. Over the
1974/75-1977/78 period, output tripled in the Government and tourism sectors,
and increased tenfold in construction. Overall GDP is estimated to have
increased about seven percent a year in real terms. The expenditure pattern
highlights the country's severe external dependence; the average level of
consumption exceeded the domestic product by about 75 percent, a situation
made possible by a substantial inflow of migrants' remittances (para. 4).
Total investment averaged 23 percent of GDP, compared to 14 percent in 1974/75,
reflecting a sustained rise in government construction activity, and private
investment in diamond mining.
9.        On the fiscal side, government revenue stagnated between 1974/75-
1976/77 at about R 30 million, as customs receipts declined, but jumped to
R 54 million in 1977/78 as customs receipts doubled after the 1976 revision
of the revenue-sharing formula of the Customs Agreement. Over the same period,
recurrent expenditure increased from R 19 million to R 45 million, implying a
growth rate of 34 percent a year in current prices, as a result of: (i) revisions
of public service wages and salaries in 1975 and again in 1977 partly to stem
the outflow of skilled workers to South Africa; (ii) continuing expansion of the
Government administration; and (iii) growing recurrent budgetary demands of an
expanding development program. Following a R 2 million deficit in 1976/77, the
recurrent budget realized a R 8 million surplus in 1977/78 which resulted mainly
from the sharp rise in customs receipts as well as in grants following Lesotho's
appeal in 1976 for additional assistance to strengthen its economy and reduce
its external dependence. In 1977/78, capital expenditure increased almost
fourfold over the 1974/75 level, as a result of improved implementation capacity,
stemming from a gradual buildup of local skilled manpower and operation of a
substantial technical assistance program.
10.       Lesotho's balance of payments is characterized by a chronic imbalance
in merchandise trade which is funded largely by migrants' remittances and
official transfers.  Between 1974 and 1977, total merchandise imports increased
from R 74 million to about R 169 million, reflecting: (i) the capital goods
requirements of an expanding development program, (ii) a 20 percent increase
in the number of migrants in South Africa, and (iii) the import demand for
manufactured goods from rising household incomes due to increased migrants'
remittances. Over the same period, exports increased slightly from R 10 million
to R 12 million reflecting a stagnation in recorded exports of wool and mohair,
the main traditional export commodities. On the services account, net earnings



- 4 -
of migrant:s in 1977 were 2.5 times the 1974 level mainly as a result of rapidly
rising minie wages and increased migration, while net transfers doubled with the
surge in customs receipts.  The overall balance of payments showed an ave:-age
deficit of R 5 millioni a year. However, this only partly reflects the country's
foreign reserves posilion, given the integration of the monetary system w:ith
that of South Africa, and the substantial under-recording of excternal tranis-
actions.
11.       Until 1975, the United Kingdom was the major source of financia.l
assistance, but during the last few years, a growing number of bilateral 2.nd
multilateral agencies have provided grants or concessionary credits for Iroject
financing. At the end of December 1977, Lesotho's external debt (disbursed and
outstanding) was estimiated at US$23 million; service obligations were US8C.5
million representing less than two percent of recurrent revenue (given Lesotho's
special monetary arrangements with South Africa, relating debt service paLyment:s
to recurrent revenue rather than to foreign exchange earnings is a more iiieaning-
ful concept of the country's debt service capacity). Over the next seve:i:al
years, most of Lesotho's capital assistance is likely to continue as grar.ts or
concessionary credits, and servicing of external public debt is expected tD re-
main at about two percent of government recurrent revenue.
12.       Lesotho's medium-term economic outlook will be largely influenced by
the terms of its continuing economic arrangements with South Africa, part:i-
cularly its membership in the Customs Union, and the level of future migra':ion.
These uncertainties, including its delicate geopolitical situation, coupled
with the country's scarcity of natural resources, underline the difficult task
of development. While current revenue will continue to critica:Lly depend on
the Customs Union, the country's growing absorptive capacity and the recurrent
budgetary commitments of an expanding public investment program call for a more
rapid increase in revenue and greater diversification of revenue sources.
Although the Governmenit is examining ways to increase internal revenue fo:llow-
ing a recent IMF review of the fiscal system, given the country's narrow t:ax
base, these objectives can only be realized in the long term. In the mea:ntime,
donor agencies should consider financing in most projects not only all fo.Veign
costs, but also a substantial part of local costs. If Lesotho is to susta.ia
its rate of economic development, it will need continuing external assist,:.nze
on grant and IDA terms.,
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS
13.       To date Lesotho has received seven IDA credits totalling US$35.2
million for seven projects (excluding US$9.0 million for a Third Highway
Project scheduled for consideration by the Executive Directors on March 13,
1979). Two credits (US$11.6 million) in the agricultural sector have
helped to finance the Thaba Bosiu Rural Development project (1973) and
the first phase of the Basic Agricultural Services Program (1978). Both
projects aim to expand the availability of agricultural inputs and servicei to
small farmers in the traditional sector. Two credits (US$11.5 million) in the



-5-
educational sector have helped to expand Lesotho's vocational, technical and
commercial training capability as well as increase the availability of second-
ary education in the rural areas. Two credits (US$9.6 million) have helped
finance two roads projects which improved sections of Lesotho's major road
network and supported the initial operations of a labor-intensive construction
unit. Finally, one credit (US$2.5 million) has assisted Lesotho's industrial
development by providing financial assistance to the Lesotho National Develop-
ment Corporation (LNDC) and its subsidiary, the Basotho Enterprise Development
Corporation (BEDCO). As of December 31, 1978, IDA credits outstanding and
disbursed amounted to US$17 million, representing an estimated share of
Lesotho's total external debt (disbursed) of some 65 percent. Due to the fact
that most external aid in the past has been provided on grant terms, servicing
of IDA credits is estimated to have increased to about 20 percent of total
debt service at the end of 1977. Annex II contains a summary statement of IFC
investments and IDA credits and notes on the execution of the ongoing projects.
The country's capacity for project implementation has improved considerably
over the last few years. Consequently, the quality of implementation of Bank
Group assisted projects is reasonable.
14.       Future operations will continue to support the Government's devel-
opment objectives. Preliminary discussions have been held on a possible
third rural development project, which may focus on land use, livestock and/
or soil conservation. The Bank Group also expects to continue its assistance
to the two financial intermediaries, LNDC and BEDCO and preparatory work is
under way for an urban development project. In addition, the Bank Group is
reviewing with the Government the need for a technical assistance project
which would focus on strengthening the Government's planning capability and
management of its parastatal organizations.
PART III - THE WATER SUPPLY AND WASTE DISPOSAL SECTOR
15.       Lesotho's water resources are substantial although availability is
constrained significantly by location and season. The total annual resource
has been estimated to be 4,500 million m3 (3.6 million ac ft) of which surface
water represents over 99 percent. However, due to more extended durations of
flows and generally better and more uniform water quality, springs and bore-
holes -- particularly the former -- are used widely throughout Lesotho to meet
domestic water demands in rural areas.  Due to steep slopes and little alluvium,
runoff tends to be rapid and carryover storage frequently is necessary for
supplies dependent upon surface sources.  Natural water quality of all supplies
is good relative to chemical characteristics.  Supplies from boreholes and
protected springs generally have good overall quality throughout the year.
Due to high turbidity, suspended solids concentrations, and fecal pollution,
surface sources normally are used only for urban supplies involving relatively
large quantifies, and for which water treatment is provided.



- 6 -
16.       Less than one percent of Lesotho's water resource currently is used
and there is little likelihood that this proportion will increase substan-
tially in the immediate future.  With this in mind, the Government is inves-
tigating the feasibility of exporting a portion of Lesotho's surplus wat:er to
the Republic of South Africa (RSA).  Meanwhile, GOL has authorized stud:'.es of
domestic water needs.
Public Health
17.       The principal water-related diseases reported are:  diarrhea, typhoid,
hepatitis, polio and infectious skin and eye diseases. The proposed pr:)ject is
expected to improve public health by reducing the prevalence of such dis;eases.
However, hygiene at personal and household levels apparently is little iinder*-
stood or practiced so that health education needs to be intensified. U'AID-
financed rural health and rural water supply projects are expected to rE:solve
this problem. We propose to keep this matter under constant review dur:ng
supervision of this project (para. 36).
Sector Organization  and Development
18.       Five different ministries are active in the sector.  The Mini.;try of
Works (MW) and the Ministry of Rural Development are the principal ones: the
remainder mainly are supportive. MW is active in the sector through it; Water
and Sewerage Branch (WSB) and its Hydrological and Meteorological Servizes
Branch (HMSB). WSB provides water in nine district headquarters towns
(including the capital, Maseru) and a newly developed town located in central
Lesotho, in addition to sewer service in two of these towns. WSB also expect:s
to manage water systems in four additional towns as soon as facilities naow
under design are commissioned.  WSB will also take over ownership of the
existing small water supply system in the town of Roma, one of the towna
benefiting from the proposed project, from the National University of Lesotho
by March 31, 1980 (Section 4.10 of the draft Credit Agreement).  HMSB develops
and maintains hydrologic and meteorologic networks, and maintains supporting
records.  The Ministry of Rural Development is responsible for constructing
and operating water supply schemes in rural areas of Lesotho through it~:
Village W'ater Supply section.
19.       Ministry of' Interior involvement in the sector is limited to l[aseru.
and the district headlquarters towns, where it is responsible for removal, and
disposal of night soil from bucket latrines. The Ministry of Geology, M4iaes
and Tourism carries cut ground water investigations and surveys.  The Piblic
Health Division of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (MHSW) operates
a public health laboratory and administers an external assistance grant to
improve latrines and water supplies at primary schools. Other support uunc-
tions provided by MHSW include health education, the maintenance of health
statistics, and the monitoring of solid waste disposal.



20.       WSB effectiveness is hampered by a lack of autonomy and authority
in accounting and personnel matters. GOL recognizes the need for more
autonomy but, based on experience, considers it prudent to proceed slowly.
In May 1978, as a first step, the Minister of Finance issued directions
covering WSB's operations known as the Water and Sewerage Service Directions.
The directions give WSB a measure of autonomy in the conduct of its operations
and require commercial accounts to be prepared. Very recently the Government
created a Ministry of Water, Power and Natural Resources, and as soon as the
administrative arrangements have been made WSB will be transferred to the new
Ministry, but the scope of its operations would be unchanged.
Present Service Levels and Goals
21.       Close to 100 percent of Maseru, the only area which can be considered
urban, and a substantially lower percentage of the rural population, about
16 percent, have reasonsable access to piped water supplies. Remaining towns
(none of which have a population exceeding 6,000) are classified as rural
centers. In Maseru and in the eight district headquarters treated water is
delivered to domestic customers through inside taps, outside taps, and public
standposts. Rural supplies, which provide little, if any, control of water
quality, are available mainly at the source or from public standposts.  In
Maseru sewer service is provided to about 50 percent of the population. The
balance of the urban population generally is served by bucket latrines or pit
privies although, in some instances, conservancy tanks or septic tanks are
used. About 50 percent of the population of Maseru s peri-urban area are
served through pit and bucket latrines while the balance have no sanitation
facilities.
22.       The Government's objectives and development strategy, as reflected
by the first and second five-year development plans (1970/71-1974/75 and
1975/76-1979/80, respectively), include surveying the country's water re-
sources and needs and constructing facilities to serve specific population
centers and viLlages during the plan periods. Except in Maseru, wastewater
systems in the district headquarters towns are not considered necessary until
after adequate town water supply schemes are completed. In the meantime, the
Government intends to improve other types of sanitation service.
Sector Investment
23.       Capital financing for the sector has not been a significant con-
straint in the first and second development plan periods, and is not ex-
pected to be one during the next several years. Considerable assistance
has been provided by various external sources and this is expected to
continue. Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (KfW) is to finance water supply
schemes in six of thirteen towns to which the Government gives priority and
schemes for the remaining seven towns would be financed by the proposed IDA
Credit. The United Kingdom is financing the Maseru sewerage modification
program and the African Development Fund is assisting in the Maseru water
supply development.



Tariff Policy
24.       Piped water supplies in Maseru and in the district headquarters
towns generally are metered and a flat rate tariff of R 1 per thousand Ig;
(US$0.96 per thousand US gal), which does not fully cover the operating
cost of the service, is levied by WSB. GOL subsidizes remaining costs.
Customers with private connections are charged whereas water from public
standposts is free to consumers. Government recognizes that a National
Water Supply and Sewerage pricing policy, based on economic principles,
needs to be developed, but this cannot be done immediately (para. 32).
25.       Information on past operating expenditures is not available  ia
a usable form.  Government expenditures on major maintenance of rural wLt:er
supply arnd sanitation schemes will increase as sector goals for village
water supplies are met. A village water supply project being considere(d
for United States Agency for International Development (USAID) financing
has a component for strengthening maintenance and operation in recogniticn
of the importance of this aspect.
Possible Constraints
26.       The principal constraint to planned sector development is a shlort-
age of qualified staff to plan and administer projects and to operate amad
manage the water supply and wastewater systems efficiently. In addition,
insufficient public education on health and hygiene prevents full benefits
from being derived from the investments.  To the extent possible, devel:lp-
ment projects should incorporate commitments or include components desi~,;ned
to overcome these constraints.
PART IV - THE PROJECT
27.       The project was prepared by the Government, with assistance by
consultants, and appraised in the field by an IDA mission in May 1978.
Negotiations were held in Washington from January 23 to 24, 1979. The
Lesotho delegation was led by the late Mr. Mapetla, then Permanent Secre:ary
of the Ministry of Finance.
28.       A report entitled "Staff Appraisal Report, Water Supp-ly Projecl:,
Kingdom of Lesotho" (No. 2230-LSO, dated March 1, 1979) is being distributed
separately.
Project Objectives and Description
29.       The objectives of the proposed project are to provide water suypLies
to about 20,000 new consumers in seven small towns by 1986 and improve scrzice
to 21,000 current consumers through better control of water quality and



-9-
enhanced access through provision for additional public standposts. Specifi-
cally, the proposed project would, over a five-year period, provide funds for:
(i) construction of water supply system extensions at each of seven towns
(Leribe, Mafeteng, Mohale's Hoek, Mokhotlong, Quthing, Roma and Teyateyaneng);
(ii) institutional development through consulting services for accounting im-
provements and tariff studies; and (iii) engineering consulting services.
Detailed Features
30.       Construction Work.  Civil works would consist of:  (i) source of
supply facilities; (ii) treatment works; (iii) pumping plant structures;
(iv) transmission mains; (v) service reservoirs; (vi) distribution systems;
and (vii) ancillary structures. Equipment would include: (i) pumping plant;
(ii) treatment plant; (iii) water meters; (iv) vehicles and (v) tools and
miscellaneous equipment. Consulting engineers would be employed whose quali-
fications, experience, terms and conditions of employment would be satisfac-
tory to IDA for design and supervision of construction (Section 3.02(a)(i)
of the draft Credit Agreement).
31.       Institutional Development and Financial Management.  Although WSB
does not at present operate as a separate accounting entity the Government
intends that it should do so in future. Its accounting procedures are in
accordance with usual Government cash accounting practices and are mainly
concerned with accountability for parliamentary approved expenditures. Account-
ing information is inadequate for effective management. In order that WSB's
accounting will conform to the provisions of the Water and Sewerage Service
Trading Directions and provide adequate information for financial management
and reporting, the project would provide funds for the employment of account-
ing consultants to design and assist with the implementation of an accounting
system, identify further staffing needs and train or arrange for training
for accounting staff. The borrower would appoint such consultants with
qualifications, experience and terms of employment acceptable to the Associa-
tion (Section 3.02(a) (ii) of the draft Credit Agreement) and not later than
March 31, 1980 after consultation with the Association, implement such
consultant's recommendations as are considered appropriate on a time schedule
to be agreed with the Association (Section 4.04 of the draft Credit Agreement).
32.       In November 1977 the Government doubled WSB's water rate (to US$0.96
per thousand US gallon equivalent). However, the tariff is still inadequate
to meet cash operating expenses and debt service. The Government recognizes
the need for developing a national water supply and sewerage pricing policy
based on economic pricing, including possible changes in the present practice
of charging one national flat rate for all water supplied to WSB's consumers,
other than standpipe users. The project would provide funds for WSB to
employ consultants with qualification, experience, and terms and conditions
of service acceptable to the Association to carry out a tariff study by
June 30, 1980 (Section 3.02(b) of the draft Credit Agreement).



- 10 -
33.       Based upon the study, the borrower will, not later than September 30,
1980, establish annua:L financial performance standards acceptable to the
Association including, inter alia, the requirement to produce annual revenues
sufficient to cover a:Ll operating expenses, including depreciation, and a
reasonable return on ithe assets used for WSB's services. Promptly thereafter
WSB will modify the level and structure of water and sewerage tariffs to mteet
such standlards (Section 4.05(a)(ii) of the draft Credit Agreement). WSB would
revalue its fixed assets annually using methods acceptable to the Association
and would have the first such revaluation completed for the year ended
March 31, 1979 within six months from the date of the Credit Agreement, )I
such other date as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the Associatio:i
(Section 4.08 of the draft Credit Agreement).
34.       Pending the basic tariff reform, the Government will, prior to
credit effectiveness, raise WSB's water supply and sewerage tariffs to l^els
adequate to cover cash operating expenses and debt service (Section 5.01,d)
of the draft Credit Agreement) and will maintain them at levels sufficieait
for such purpose (Section 4.05(b) of the draft Credit Agreement).
35.       In order that WSB can operate effectively as a separate financ:.al
entity, the Government, will pay WSB for water supplied through public stand-
pipes at average cost, less charges to consumers, if any, and will pay foar
water supplied to Government departments and agencies at rates comparable to
users with similar water consumption patterns (Section 4.06 of the draft
Credit Agreement).
36.       To ensure that WSB's limited management resources are not over
extended, apart from the project and the ongoing AfDF- and KfW-financed
projects, WSB will not until project completion, incur annual capital ex
penditures exceeding US$200,000 without prior consultation with the
Association (Section 4.09 of the draft Credit Agreement).
Project Cost and Financing
37.       The total cost of the project is estimated at R 6.1 million
(US$7.0 million equivalent) net of taxes and duties (which are negligiblE)
Foreign expenditures fior procuring goods and services outside Lesotho wou.ld
amount to US$4.8 million or 69 percent of total outlays. An allowance oK
20 percent was applied, as physical contingencies for site investigations
and all civil works involving surface water intakes and/or raw water sto-age
at each of the towns. A 10 percent physical contingency allowance was a: sumedi
for all other components. To cover price escalation, allowances of 9 pe :cent
for 1979 and 8 percent for each succeeding year have been applied. The
proposed IDA Credit of US$6.0 million would finance all foreign expenditi:ras
and approximately US$1.2 million equivalent of local costs and would cov(.r
about 86 percent of the total project costs. The Government will financs
about US$1.0 million equivalent. In order to encourage WSB to operate ol:
a commercial basis, the Government will make available to WSB the US$6.0
million proceeds of IDA Credit at 7.5 percent annual interest over 24 yeair3



- 11 -
including four years grace (Section 3.01(c) of the draft Credit Agreement
and para. 51). There has been no comparable lending in the sector and funds
generally have been made available to public enterprises as grants or at
very low interest rates. Inflation during 1976-78 averaged about 12 percent
annually; inflation is expected to be at a rate of nine percent in 1979 and
eight percent thereafter.
Project Area
38.       Each of the project towns is a regional population center with
importance as the site of regional institutions such as hospitals, schools,
missions and, except Roma, district administration centers. The administra-
tion of the water supply and sewerage system in Roma, the site of the National
University of Lesotho, which presently is outside the jurisdiction of WSB,
will be transferred to WSB by March 31, 1980 (Section 4.10 of the draft
Credit Agreement). Six of the towns are in the region of the country where
intensive agriculture, a prime objective of the national development program,
is possible and whaere the IDA-financed Lesotho Basic Agricultural Project
(Credit 795-LSO) is located. The seventh town, Mokhotlong, is in the north-
east mountains, an area which has mineral potential. Four of the towns are
on the country's few paved highways. In all cases, population growth is ex-
pected to match or exceed the national average.
Project Implementation
39.       WSB, assisted by consultants, would be responsible for project
implementation. Engineering consultants would be utilized for detailed
design, preparation of tender documents, evaluation of tenders and super-
vision of construction. In addition, during the project period consultants
would make feasibility studies required for the preparation of a Phase II
project. WSB recently engaged Binnie and Partners (Binnie), a UK firm which
participated in project preinvestment studies, to design the KfW-financed
water supply project; it is expected that Binnie would be retained on the
project. On that basis initial investigations and design of the project
are expected to begin by mid-1979 and commissioning of the physical com-
ponents is planned for mid-1982.
40.       WSB has until now been headed by a Chief Water and Sewerage
Engineer, with limited responsibility and authority over personnel and
accounting matters, as these matters have largely been dealt with by MW's
personnel branch and ME staff. The Government has recognized that WSB
should be given greater autonomy, and in May 1978, as a first step, the
Minister of Finance issued directions covering the establishment of
a "Water and Sewerage Service Trading Account" under MW and the
appointment of a Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer,
who is to be a member of a Board controlling WSB's activities, will
be responsible for the efficient management of Water Supply and
Sewerage Services and for all staff including accountants.



- 12 -
Powers regarding appointment, promotion and dismissal of staff have also re-
cently been delegated to WSB, and permission to open a separate bank acccunt
for WSB's transactions has been obtained from the Ministry of Finance. A.
Chief Executive Officer and a Financial Controller are to be appointed prior
to effectiveness of t:he Credit Agreement (para. 51). The borrower will
ensure that a qualified Chief Executive Officer and a Financial Control:Ler
will be maintained in their positions with appropriate powers (Sections
3.01(b) of the draft Credit Agreement). Appointment of two qualified wELter
supply engineers would be a condition of credit effectiveness (Section 5.01
(a) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Environmental Health and Safety Aspects
41.       The project. is expected to bring some improvement in public h(i:alth,
although in order to derive maximum environmental benefit from investments
in water supply facilities, a complementary program of public health ediuca-
tion and improved standards for operating water systems is needed. The
projects financed by USAID (para. 17) are expected to help in these are..s.
Implementation of the. project will be closely coordinated with MHSW sta:Ef
at all levels to assure that appropriate environmental health is maintained
in each of the project towns. To help ensure that public health measures
related to the project are adequate, the Government intends to carry out
a study covering public health education needs through 1982 in the water
supply and sanitation sectors and exchange views with the Association or.
the study and means for implementing its recommendations.
42.       The proposed project dams are relatively small and carry litt:.e
risk to life or property. Although WSB currently neither owns nor operXitis
dams outside Maseru, future operation by WSB does not appear to pose anm
undue risk.
Procurement and Disbursement
43.       Except as indicated below all procurement financed by the proIlo:sed
credit would be awarded on the basis of international competitive biddinlg
in accordance with Ba.nk Group guidelines. Although there are no suitable
local civil works con.tractors at present, provision for a 7-1/2 percent
preference on bids by local firms has been made, at the borrower's request:,
in case suitable domestic civil works contracting capability develops ir. 1:ime.
Contracts for the prccurement of single units or for groups of items of equipi-
ment, vehicles or spare parts estimated to cost less than US$25,000 eact., and
not exceeding US$100,000 equivalent in the aggregate, may be awarded after
solicitation of quotations from at least three suppliers.  Minor civil w:rks
amounting to about US$0.7 million equivalent may be constructed by the Cnern-
ment through force account, in which case only the material would be finariced
by IDA.  In order to expedite progress and effectively coordinate with twe! Kflw-
financed six towns water supply project, GOL will begin the implementatiDr of
the project shortly. Retroactive financing of up to US$100,000 equivale at: to
finance detailed dam site investigations and design by the engineering
consultants is recommended.



- 13 -
44.       The IDA Credit would be disbursed as follows:  (i) 86 percent of
total expenditure on civil works, excluding works constructed under force
account, if any; (ii) 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 90 percent
of local expenditures for materials for work carried out under force account,
if any, and for vehicles, equipment or spare parts; and (iii) 100 percent of
foreign expenditures and 80 percent of local expenditures for consulting
services.
45.       Accounts, Audit and Reporting.  WSB would have its accounts
audited annually by auditors acceptable to the Association, and would
furnish such accounts to the Association within nine months after the end
of fiscal year 1980 and not later than six months after the end of sub-
sequent fiscal years (Section 4.02(b)(ii) of the draft Credit Agreement).
As the Government's Audit Department does not have the staff to audit
commercial accounts, the Auditor General will delegate his responsibility
to a private firm. In addition, within six months after project implementa-
tion, WSB would prepare and submit to the Association a project completion
report (Section 3.04(c) of the draft Credit Agreement).
Justification, Benefits and Risks
46.       The project would, by 1986, supply hygienic water to some 20,000
new consumers (an increase of about 95 percent in the seven project towns)
who now rely upon unprotected water from springs and streams. It would
also improve the reliability of service and water quality for about 21,000
current consumers. The project would strengthen a key institution (WSB),
through the appointment of consultants who would design and implement a
commercially oriented accounting system and recommend changes in the tariff
structure; and by requiring the borrower to have a qualified and experienced
Chief Executive Officer and Financial Controller for WSB as well as two
additional water supply engineers.
47.       The project has many of the characteristics of a rural water supply
project due to the small size and nature of the project towns. As indicated
in para. 34, project water consumers, together with WSB consumers located
elsewhere, would pay a tariff based on the recovery of cash operating costs
and debt service. The internal financial rate of return, which would be
negative, substantially underestimates the real economic return because
health and amenity benefits, as well as consumers' surpluses, for a project
such as this are impossible to quantify. Despite this, the project is worth-
while because of non-financial benefits described in para. 46.
48.       The principal risk is that staffing inadequacies might jeopardize
project implementation. However, this risk is minimized by: (i) providing
for consultants who will train the accounting staff of WSB; (ii) a training
program to be financed by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany;



- 14 -
and (iii) requiring the borrower to have a Chief Executive Officer and a
Financial Controller for WSB with the necessary qualifications and experiencle
and to appoint two additional water supply engineers. As it may take snile
time to establish an adequate information system on which to accurately
estimate tariff increases needed to meet financial objectives, it is pcssible
that the tariff increase estimated to meet operating expenses and debt
service may produce :Less than the required revenues. In this case, as in
the past, GOL would have to meet any operating cash deficit.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMENTS AND AUTHORITY
49.       The draft ])evelopment Credit Agreement between the Kingdom of
Lesotho and the Association and the Recommendation of the Committee
provided for in Article V, Section l(d) of the Articles of Agreement
are being distributed to the Executive Directors separately.
50.       Features oE special interest are referred to in Section III cf
Annex III of this report.
51.       Conditions for effectiveness of the Credit Agreement would be
that (i) the Chief Executive Officer, the Financial Controller and two
water supply engineers be appointed; (ii) accounting consultants be
appointed to design and assist in the implementation of a commercial
accounting system and to undertake or arrange for related-staff trainirng;
(iii) arrangements for passing on proceeds of the Credit to WSB be in fuLl
force and effect; and (iv) water supply and sewerage tariffs be increased
to a level sufficient to cover estimated cash operating expenses and dE!b:
service.
52.       I am satisfied that the proposed credit would comply with the!
Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECOMENDATION
53.       I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposec credit.

DEFINITIONS OF SOCIAL INDICATORS
Ha":  The adjusted group averages for each indicator are population-weighted geometric means, excluding the extreme values of the indicator and the most
populated country in each group. Coverage of countries among the indicators depends on availability of data and is not uniform. Due to lack of data,
group averages for Capital Surplus Oil Exporters and indicators of access to water and excreta disposal, housing, income distribution and poverty are
simple population-weighted geometric means without the exclusion of extreme values.

Credit No. 497-LSO   Education I Project; US$4.0 million; July 25, 1974;
Effectiveness Date: January 23, 1975; Closing
Date: March 31, 1979.
The project is proceeding satisfactorily and is expected to be com-
pleted shortly and accounts and withdrawals finalized by the March 31, 1979
credit closing date. Educational objectives are expected to be realized when
the physical facilities are completed and put into use. Costs are within the
original appraisal estimates.
Credit No. 619-LSO   Second Highway Project; US$5.5 million; March 10, 1976;
Effectiveness Date: July 28, 1976; Closing
Date: December 31, 1980.
The project is proceeding satisfactorily. The civil works contract
is progressing in accordance with the implementation schedule agreed at nego-
tiations. The Labor-Intensive Construction Unit (LCU) component which started
about four months behind schedule, mainly due to delay in selection of consul-
tants, is now operational. Practically all the funds earmarked for the LCU
have been committed.
Credit No. 702-LSO   Development Finance Company Project (DFC); US$2.5 million;
May 20, 1977; Effectiveness Date: August 23, 1977;
Closing Date: December 31, 1981.
So far US$900,000 have been committed. Because of management changes
and delays in recruiting key staff, LNDC has made slow progress in improving
its organization, staffing, procedures, and portfolio. LNDC's financial situa-
tion has not yet improved, but it will continue to get financial support from
the Government as expected.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they do
not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

The project: was declared effective March 30, 1978, about one :acnth
beyond the originally specified date, February 28, 1978. Delays in pro-ject
execution are directly related to staffing of the architectural team wh:'ch
has affected the cred,it's effectiveness and also implementation. Since the
project architect has been hired the progress has been good. Plans for the
National Curriculum Development Center at Leribe are well advanced, an,[
design work is progressing well for all the other project components. 'I:rDcu-re-
ment preparations for furniture and equipment have been initiated. The
Project Unit established to administer Credit 497-LSO is also responsible for
implementing the second project.

Closing Date: March 31, 1985.
The project continues to make good progress with its recruitment and
building program. The training of agricultural staff has now been started at
a newly desveloped center at Leribe. There appears to be an increasing aware-
ness on the part of t'he Ministry of Agriculture of the need to provide En agreed
set of guidelines to agricultural extension staff, but action has not yet been
taken to withdraw the widely conflicting  official recommendations now lsing
given. BASP is slowly being drawn into a more central role in the Minis try but
is not yet: in a position to decisively influence agricultural strategy. The
marketing component of the project is being reviewed by BASP Management ir. the
light of the declining volume of produce being handled by the Produce Mazketing
Corporation and its consequent financial difficulties.
