MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
Oe THE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED CREDIT OF SDR 43.0 MILLION
(US$57.0 MILLION EQUIVALENT)
TO THE REPUBLIC OF GUINEA
FOR A SECOND URBAN PROJECT
1.        The  following  memorandum  and  recommendation  on  a  proposed
development credit to the Republic of Guinea for SDR 43.0 million
(US$57.0 million equivalent) is submitted for approval. The proposed credit
would be on standard IDA terms with 40 years' maturity and would help firance
a Second Urban Project. The project would be cofinanced for US$16.5 million
equivalent by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), the Caisse
Centrale de Coop6ration Economique (CCCE) of France, and the Fonds d'Aide a
la Cooperation (FAC) of France.
2.        Background.  Although predominantly rural, Guinea is experiencing
rapid urbanization. The urban population has grown from 450,000 inhabitants
in 1960 to 1,650,000 in 1989 and is expected to reach 4,500,000 by the year
2010.  Over 602 of the urban population is concentrated in Conakry, the
capital city, the principal port and the major industrial and commercial
center. As a result of the lack of infrastructure, other cities have found
it difficult to attract economic activities and are confined to a secondary
role.  The Government of the Second Republic initiated, in late 1985, a
far-reaching stabilization and adjustment program. The initial response of
the private sector to the new economic environment has been encouraging. The
bulk of growth in manufacturing value added has been generated by
micro-enterprises in the urban informal sector. These developments have had
a strong impa-t on Conakry's economy which has accommodated most of the newly
created enterprises.
3.        When the Government of the Second Republic came to power, Guinean
cities, including Conakry, were ill-equipped to support the development of
economic activities.   After more than 25 years of severe neglect, most
infrastructure was in a state of utter disrepair. In a limited time the new
Government, with the support of the international donor community, has
initiated significant improvements to the urban physical environment.
Continuous efforts are, however, indispensable to make up for the accumulated
backlog in the provision of essential urban infrastructure and services, as
well as to be able to accommodate the rapid ongoing economic expansion and
population growth. Existing deficiencies result not only from the lack of
appropriate investments; they are also the consequence of the pervasive
weakness of the institutions responsible for the planning, provision and
maintenance of basic urban services.
4.        Rationale for IDA Involvement.  The proposed project constitutes
a balanced program of key infrastructure upgrading, resource mobilization,
institutional development and sector policy reforms. Implementation of this
program would result in more efficient and sustainable provision of urban
infrastructure and services, improvement in the overall efficiency of Guinean
cities, and a better working and living environment for the development of
economic and social activities. The project will help clarify the respon-
sibilities of urban agencies, rationalize urban investment programming,
improve the financing of urban services, and promote better land management
and implementation of a new housing policy. These programs would, in turn,
generate better resource allocation in the sector, increase the volume of



-2-
private savings and productive investments in housing and economic
activities, and stimulate the develcpment of private sector activities in the
provision  of  urban  services.    Moreover,  local  authorities  would  be
strengthened in their capacity to intervene in a coherent and permanent way
to provide and maintain essential urban services. Improved access to urban
services would also promote employment-generating activities in Conakry and
in major secondary centers, as well as in their rural hinterlands, and would
thus contribute to the growth of agricultural productivity.
5.        Proiect Obiectives.  The proposed project aims at improving the
functioning of Conakry and secondary cities as centers of economic growth
through a three-pronged approach of infrastructure upgrading, institutional
strengthening and local resource mobilization. Building upon the experience
of the ongoing First Urban Project, the proposed project would assist
Governmerit in implementing its urban strategy and would consolidate the basj.s
for sustainable urban development. The project would support the implementa-
tion of a new housing policy designed to increase the role of private and
municipal developers in replicable land development operations. The project
would also support tne development of local urban institutions and stimulate
urban employment through support for the development of small enterprises.
Further, through its multi-faceted approach, the proposed project would pave
the way for future programs designed to improve the urban environment through
appropriate support for local participation in the decentralization and
liberalization process underway in Guinea.
6.        Proiect  Description.    The  proposed  project  would  includet
(a) financing of a priority urban infrastructure program to complement
upgrade and rehabilitate key roads and drainage networks in Conakry ana
selected secondary cities; (b) implementation of a 200-ha land development
operation applying the institutional and financial mechanisms proposed in the
new housing strategy designed to increase  formally recognized housing
production; (c) continuation of the program to assist the- development of
small construction enterprises launched under the First Urban Project; and
(d) strengthening of urban  institutions  responsible  for infrastructure
planning, construction and maintenance, including support for the improvement
of local resource mobilization and the provision of urban services.  The
latter includes a program to improve the management and financing of UPSU,
Conakry's urban services unit.
7.        Agreements Reached.  During negotiations, agreements were reached
with the Government on the following:
(a)  Conditions of Effectiveness will be that (i) the Presidential Order
establishing the organization and functioning of the City Council
of Conakry be signed; (ii) the Presidential Order and Decree
creating and establishirg the functioning of the land development
fee and of the revolving fund for land development operations be
signed; and (iii) the Order creating the Steering Committee for
Urban Land Development be signed, and the project director be
appointed.
(b)  Conditions of Disbursement will be (i) for the financing of works
related to the land development component, that the plan, program
and development strategy for thie first 200-ha operation be reviewed
and agreed with the Bank; and (ii) for the financing of UPSU's



operational costs, that UPSU's financ.ng plan be reviewed and
agreed with the Bank on an annual basis.
8.        Benefits. The beneficiaries of the project will be the inhabitants
of Conakry and secondary cities through improved sanitary condicions and
better access to economic activitlea as a result of improved urban services
and infrastructure network.   Further, the project would have a positive
impact on the physical, health and socio-economic environment of the urban
population.    Urban poverty would be  alleviated  and urban  employment
stimulated as a result of improvement to the economic and physical conditions
supporting the development of small enterprises in the informal sector.
9.        Risks.  Major risks result from the weak implementation capacity
of both central and local inst!.tutions. Also, delays in decision-making, for
political reasons, may delay improvements in local resource mobilizatio.i and
implementation of the proposed policy reforms.  To minimize these risks,
technical assistance and training would be provided to adequately strengthen
urban agencies. Moreover, clear political commitment to the proposed urban
strategy was obtained during project preparation and was confirmed at
appraisal and negotiations.
10.       Recommendation.   I am satisfied that the proposed credit would
comply with the Articles of Agreement of the International Development
Association and recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
credit.
