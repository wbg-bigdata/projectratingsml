KOREA
APPRAISAL OF THE
KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
SUMMARY
i.        The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) was established
in 1967 with the active assistance of the Bank Group, including IFC which
at present owns about 10.5% of KDFC's share capital. KDFC has to date re-
ceived five Bank loans totalling US$150 million of which the latest for
US$55 million is expected to be fully committed by mid-1977. KDFC has also
obtained from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) two loans totalling US$70
million since 1974. With IFC's assistance, KDFC raised in May 1976 its
first foreign commercial loan of US$19.8 million from its foreign share-
holders including IFC itself.
ii.       In 1976 the Korean economy achieved a real growth rate of 15.2%
as compared with an average of 8.5% p.a. in the two previous years. This
performance almost equalled the record growth rate of 16.7% achieved in
1973, and resulted primarily from the strong performance of exports which
increased in 1976 by about 44% in volume. The Government set two major
economic targets for 1976, namely, to restrain the rate of inflation to
10% p.a., and to reduce by about US$0.5 billion the balance of payments cur-
rent account deficit which amounted to US$1.9 billion in 1975. The first
goal was achieved. Wholesale prices, which had increased by nearly 80%
between the end of 1973 and the end of 1975, are estimated to have increased
by only 10% in 1976. The second target has been substantially exceeded
since the current account deficit for 1976 is estimated to have been kept
below US$300 million. In 1976, the Government introduced restrictive mone-
tary policies which resulted in a growth of domestic credit by only 20% in
1976, compared with increases of 54% and 32% in 1974 and 1975 respectively.
In order to contain credit demand by Korean industries and improve resource
allocation, the Government undertook in August 1976 an upward adjustment of
the general interest rate structure. Both deposit and lending rates were
raised by an average of 2 percentage points. A prime lending rate system
was established for working capital loans and differential rates introduced
for capital loans depending on their maturity.
iii.      Since the previous Bank appraisal in 1975, KDFC's performance has
continued to be highly satisfactory from both the institutional and develop-
mental standpoints. KDFC remains one of the best organized, most efficient
and innovative DFCs with which the Bank Group is associated. The quality of
KDFC's management and staff is reflected in its high professional standards,
particularly in appraisal and follow-up work. KDFC's financial performance
and position remain satisfactory. As of December 31, 1976, its total assets
amounted to US$181 million equivalent, and its net worth to US$19.8 million
equivalent. Its 1976 earnings represented a return of 18.7% on average net
worth. Its portfolio is exceptionally sound and has been free of arrears for
the past two years. Since its inception, KDFC has approved financial assist-
ance for the manufacturing, mining, agro-industrial, fishing and transport



- ii -
sectors aggregating W 106.4 billion of which 29%'% was approved in 1976. Its
disbursements over the period 1971-76 accounted for approximately 2.8% of the
total fixed manufacturing investment in Korea.
iv.       While KDFC remains a relatively small source of finance for the
Korean industry, it has played an important qualitative role through its con-
tributions toward improving both the resource allocation and resource mobil-
ization systems in Korea. With its high appraisal standards, KDFC has been
an efficient allocator of Bank Group funds and other resources available to
it, to industrial projects that are economically and financially viable. A
sample of 59 KDFC-financed projects shows an average economic rate of return
of 33% and a financial rate of return of 26%. KDFC-supported projects are
estimated to have annual exports of about US$600 million and to have generated
additional direct employment for some 26,000 persons. KDFC's portfolio is
highly concentrated in export-oriented projects and is reasonably diversified
in sectoral and geographical terms.
v.        Apart from its efficient operational and financial performance,
KEFC has exhibited an innovative approach to development banking and shown
a commendable record of developmental achievements, These include over the
years, the following, inter alia: (a) the identification of investment oppor-
tunities and promotion of projects in relatively new sectors such as deep sea
fishing and marine transport; (b) the promotion and establishment in 1971
of the Korea Investment and Finance Corporation (KIFC), a specialized finan-
cial intermediary designed to develop the short-term money market and secu-
rities markets; (c) the promotion and establishment in 1975 of the Korea
Development Leasing Corporation (KDLC) whose object is to lease industrial
machinery to smaller firms which cannot afford outright purchases; (d) its
assistance in setting up in 1976, jointly with the Korea Institute of Science
and Technology (KIST), the Korea Technology Advancement Corporation (K-TAC),
with the objective of advancing and commercially exploiting domestic tech-
nological discoveries; (e) a scheme (started in 1976) of co-financing with
the Regional Commercial Banks smaller projects in backward areas; (f) KDFC's
contribution to the promotion and establishment in 1976 of a zinc smelting
project involving a total investment of US$66 million; (g) studies of the
machinery industry and some agro-business activities; and (h) its consider-
able assistance in improving the design of projects it has financed. KDFC
is expected to further enhance its developmental impact over the next few
years.
vi.       KDFC has projected a growth rate of about 15% p.a. in its disburse-
ments over the five-year period 1977-81, which would maintain its present share
of total industrial investment financing. Its requirements of foreign exchange
resources for the two-year period starting July 1, 1977 are estimated at about
USS150 million. A Bank loan of US$70 million is recommended, which would cover
about 47% of the above-mentioned amount, with the balance expected to be met by
another ADB loan, and a second foreign commercial loan of up to US$30 million
to be raised from KDFC's foreign shareholders and IFC. Notwithstanding its
recent success in, and present attempts at, raising some resources from the
foreign private markets, it is realistic to expect that KDFC will have to con-
tinue to rely on official sources (IBRD, ADB, et al,) for a major proportion
of its foreign exchange requirements in the foreseeable future.



- iii -
vii.      The proposed loan would support a major component of the Government's
development strategy, namely the expansion of export-oriented industries. In
addition, it would help continue the mutually beneficial relationship between
KDFC and the Bank Group.
viii.     In view of the strength of KDFC's management and staff, and the
soundness of its financial position and portfolio, an increase is recommended
in the debt/equity limit from 8.5:1 (imposed under the latest Bank loan) to
10.0:1, which would enable KDFC to incur the additional borrowings necessary
for it to achieve its projected level of operations. The free limit would be
increased from US$2 million to US$2.5 million. As with the previous Bank loan
(No. 1145-KO), the proceeds of the proposed loan could be used to finance up
to 60% of the cost of domestically procured equipment and machinery, and 35%
of local civil work, each representing the estimated foreign exchange compo-
nents, respectively. The other terms and conditions of the loan would be
similar to those of recent Bank loans to DFCs, including a flexible amortiza-
tion schedule conforming substantially to the aggregate of the repayment
schedules of subloans.






KOREA
APPRAISAL OF THE
KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      The Korea Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) was established
in 1967 with the active assistance of the Bank Group. The Bank has since
made five loans to KDFC totalling US$150 million, including the latest one
for US$55 million which became effective in September 1975. The Asian Devel-
opment Bank (ADB) made its first loan to KDFC in 1974, which was followed in
1976 by a second loan of US$40 million. At KDFC's inception, IFC took an
equity participation of about 14% of KDFC's share capital. Following the
sale, in 1975, of part of its shares to the German Development Corporation
(DEG), IFC's participation has been reduced to about 10.5% of KDFC's share
capital, but IFC remains KDFC's largest shareholder. With IFC's assistance,
KDFC was able, in Ilay 1976, to secure its first foreign commercial loan of
US$19.8 million from its foreign shareholders, including IFC itself.
1.02      To maintain its share of industrial financing at the average level
of the past 5 years KDFC will require, over the 2-year period starting mid-
1977, resources totalling about US$168 million of which US$150 million will
be in foreign currency. KDFC has requested a sixth loan from the Bank in an
amount of US$70 million towards meeting part of these requirements; in addi-
tion KDFC intends to raise, during that 2-year period, a second commercial
loan of US$25 to 30 million from its foreign shareholders and a third loan
from AbB.
1.03      KDFC's performance since the previous appraisal in 1975 has been
highly satisfactory. From the institutional standpoint, the soundness of its
management and staff has enabled KDFC to further improve the high standard
of its internal operations and to maintain the exceptional quality of its
portfolio. From the developmental standpoint, the objectives outlined by
KDFC in its statement of Development Strategy for 1976-77 have, by and large,
been successfully achieved. This report recommends a new Bank loan of US$70
million, to help KDFC sustain its operations and pursue its developmental
role.
II. ECONOMLIIC AND INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT I/
2.01      The recent performance of the Korean economy and, in particular, of
the industrial and financial sectors is analyzed in Annex 1. Salient features
are summarized hereunder.
1/   The latest Bank Economic Report on Korea (No. 1489-KO, dated February 23,
1977) provides a review of the recent developments in the economy and of
its objectives as outlined in the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-1981).



2.02      Rece-.t Econiomic Performance.  Even during 1974-75, when the world-
wide recessi-n slowed down the growth of its exports, the Korean economy
achieved a ;.  'rowth of more than 8% p.a.  The measures taken in December
1974 by thie Government, which aimed at smoothing the impact of the recession
and, in particular, at maintaining investment levels in industry, have enabled
Korean exporters to take full advantage of the recovery in export markets which
started in the latter half of 1975. Korean exports increased sharply in 1976
and reached an estimated US$7.8 billion, a 56% gain in current terms over the
1975 level. Thlis remarkable expansion of exports led a general recovery of the
economy and a real growth of over 15% was achieved in 1976, second only to the
exceptional 16.7% record in 1973. As a result of these impressive export
gains, Korea's current account deficit was reduced from US$1.9 billion in 1975
to less than USS300 million in 1976.
2.03      Industrial Structure and Investment.  Manufactured exports which
accounted for about 90V of all commodity exports in 1976 have undergone con-
siderable changes in their composition over the last decade. Light industrial
products still form the bulk of Korean exports of manufactures but there has
been a substantial shift towards more skill-intensive products even within
the light industrial sector; more importantly, heavy manufactures such as in-
dustrial machinery, transport equipment and electronics have gained in import-
ance. This trend is reflected in the changing structure of the manufacturing
output and in the relative shares of fixed investment allocations within the
manufacturing sector. Heavy manufactures, which in 1976 contributed just
over one third of the total manufacturing value-added have absorbed about
78% of the W 714 billion fixed investment in the manufacturing sector during
the year 1976. Seventy-two percent of the W 154 billion fixed investment in
light industries was in textiles. Total annual investment outlays in the manu-
facturing sector are expected to reach W 911 billion in 1977, of which heavy
and chemical industries would absorb 74%.
2.04      Recent Financial Developments.  Because of its heavy dependence on
foreign trade, Korea was hard-hit by the 1974-75 world-wide inflation which
followed the dramatic increases in petroleum prices since 1973. Wholesale
prices are estimated to have increased by close to 80% between the end of 1973
and the end of 1975. Financial measures taken by Government during that period
in the face of rising unemployment and of the rapid drawdown of Korea's foreign
exchange resources included a devaluation of the Won by 17.5% 1/ and selective
increases in interest rates. As a result of the tight monetary policy followed
in 1976, inflation has been largely brought under control and wholesale prices
are estimated to have increased by only 9% on a year-end basis. In order to
contain excessive loan demand and improve fund allocation, the Korean Govern-
ment undertook in August 1976 an upward adjustment of the general interest rate
structure. Both deposit and lending rates were raised by 2% on average. A
prime lending-rate system was established for working capital loans and differ-
ential rates introduced for capital loans depending on their maturity.

- 3 -
2. 05     The Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-1981).  Over the next five-year
period, the Korean economy is expected to grow at an annual rate of 9.2%
fueled by an annual increase of 16.5% in the volume of manufactured exports.
The manufacturing sector is expected to contribute 54% of the incremental GNP
during the Plan period, increasing at a rate of 14.2% p.a. In order to sus-
tain such growth, gross fixed investment would rise at 7.8% p.a.; the share
of manufacturing would marginally increase from 24.6% of total gross fixed
investment over the Third Five-Year Plan to 26.7% over the Fourth Plan period.
The shift in Korea's export strategy towards more skill-intensive products
will be further accentuated and rendered possible by a deepening of the in-
dustrial structure. The share of light industries in total manufacturing
investment is expected to decrease in favor of heavy and chemical industries
which would absorb 64% of total manufacturing investment. Investment priori-
ties within the heavy industrial sector will be somewhat shifted from highly
capital intensive industries towards the skill-intensive machinery and elec-
tronics industries. The Fourth Plan projects a declining investment ratio
from 27.7% of GNP in 1976 to 26% in 1981. National savings which in 1976
stood at 21% of GNP and thus financed approximately 80% of gross fixed in-
vestment in that year would rise to 26% of GNP by 1981. The Government ex-
pects to further reduce the rate of inflation to around 7% p.a. by 1979.
III. KDFC's ROLE It; THE ECONOfY
KDFC's Role within the Financial Sector
3.01      KDFC's charter stipulates that the purpose of its establishment is
to provide medium- and long-term financial assistance to the private sector.
In spite of some overlapping in their activities and clientele, KDFC and the
other two development finance institutions operating alongside it in Korea,
namely the Medium Industry Bank (MIB) and the Korea Development Bank (KDB),
fulfill somewhat different functions and aim at different sectors of the eco-
nomy. While IIIB confines its financing to small and medium industries 1/ KDB,
which is the largest source of industrial financing in Korea for both the pub-
lic and private sectors 2/ is largely used by the Government as the executing
arm of its industrial policies. As a consequence, KDB is called upon to
finance large Government industrial projects particularly in the non-manu-
facturing sectors, (power, transportation) 3/. KDB's lending to the private
1/   The definition of which was revised in January 1977 to include manu-
facturing enterprises with up to 300 regular employees or total assets
of up to W 500 million (US$1 million).
2/   Outstanding loans to the private sector accounted for 38% of KDB's
outstanding portfolio as of December 31, 1975.
3/   The non-manufacturing sectors accounted for 63% of KDB's outstanding
portfolio at end-1975.



sector is considerably larger than KDFC's 1/ but unlike KDFC a large
majority 2/ of KDB's loans is for domestic currency financing 3/. Another
feature of KDB's and MIB's financing is the much higher share of working
capital loans in their total lending operations which reflects the fact that,
unlike KDFC, they are empowered to and accept domestic currency deposits. In
conclusion, the scope of KDFC's operations is clearly different from that of
MIB and somewhat more restricted than that of KDB since it caters essentially
to the medium- and long-term foreign currency requirements of private enter-
prises essentially in the manufacturing sector; in the particular field of
foreign exchange financing, however, the importance of KDFC's role comes close
to, and indeed may exceed, that of KDB 4/.
3.02      Because of its large domestic currency financing and of its involve-
ment in the non-manufacturing sectors, KDB remains by far the largest source
of term finance for industry. It is estimated that in 1975, KDB's disburse-
ments of equipment loans accounted for about 6% of the total fixed capital
formation in all economic sectors. Since the start of its operations in 1968,
KDFC had approved up to end-1976 loans in an aggregate amount of W 100.9 bil-
lion (of which 93% was in foreign currency) and invested a total of W 5.5
billion in equity participations and convertible debentures. About 76% of
KDFC's disbursements over the period 1971-76 were for the manufacturing
sector. Transportation, essentially shipping, has absorbed close to 75%
of the disbursements in the non-manufacturing sector (Annex 2). KDFC's
cumulative disbursements in the manufacturing sector over the last 6 years
represented about 2.8% of the total fixed investment in that sector. Con-
sidering that KDFC financed an average of 37% of total project costs during
that period, KDFC-supported projects have accounted for about 7.6% of total
manufacturing investment.
Economic Impact of KDFC-Financed Projects
3.03      Table 1 in Annex 3 gives partial economic indicators of the 283
projects financed by KDFC between the start of its operations in 1968 and
December 31, 1976. The aggregate investment cost of these projects is
estimated at about W 270 billion of which KDFC's financing accounted for

December 31, 1975, 3.5 times larger than KDFC's total loan portfolio.

currency.

W 100.9 billion or about 37% 1/. The additional direct employment generated
by these projects should reach about 26,000 at full capacity operation. Of
the incremental sales attributable to these projects about one half is exported
which represents annual gross exports of some US$600 million. The average in-
cremental value added is estimated to represent 30% of incremental sales.
3.04      Employment Creation.  The average cost of fixed investment per job
for the projects approved by KDFC has increased from US$21,500 in 1975 2/ to
US$25,400 in 1976. Table 7 in Annex 13 shows the main characteristics of
the projects approved by KDFC under the latest IBRD Loan No. 1145-KO; the
average investment cost per job created by these projects works out at
US$20,000. KDFC-financed projects do not appear unduly capital intensive
considering that KDFC was set up to operate in the medium- to large-scale
sectors of industry and that in recent years it has, in line with Government
policy, financed a number of shipping projects which are generally capital-
intensive. The average cost per job would have been even higher in 1976 if
KDFC had not started lending through its scheme of cooperation with some Re-
gional Commercial Banks (RCBs) to much smaller projects in the less developed
areas of Korea. Eighteen such projects were approved in 1976 for which the
average cost per job can be estimated at US$7,200 (Annex 4, Appendix 5).
3.05      Size of Operations.  The average size of KDFC's domestic currency
loans has remained at about W 100 million (US$210,000 equivalent) over the
last 3 years while foreign currency loans have increased from an average of
US$0.86 million in 1974 to US$1 million in 1975 and marginally declined to
US$0.9 million in 1976 3/. The 1976 decline was entirely on account of the
18 RCB subprojects for which the average subloan amounted to US$280,000.
Annex 13 shows, however, that from a share of 38% of total loan amounts
approved in 1975, loans exceeding W 1 billion (US$2 million) have in fact
increased to 44% in 1976. While KDFC should and will pursue its limited but
qualitatively useful effort in assisting smaller projects in less developed
areas through the RCB scheme, institutions like the Medium Industry Bank (MIB)
and the Citizens National Bank (CNB) already exist in Korea which cater to
the needs of the small- and medium-sectors of industry; it would not serve
any useful purpose for KDFC to shift the main emphasis of its operations to
smaller industries.

2/   By way of comparison, the average cost of fixed investment per job for
a representative sample of DFC projects approved in 1975, was US$26,810
world-wide and US$31,130 for East Asia (see Table 6, Annex 2 of Report
No. 1543 dated March 22, 1977, entitled "Employment Creation and Small-
Scale Enterprise Development").

3.06      KDFC started to routinely calculate the economic rate of return
(ERR) in all its project appraisals in 1973. Table 2 in Annex 3 shows the
financial and economic rates of return of a sample of 59 projects appraised
by KDFC. The weighted average financial and economic rates of return work
out at 25.9% and 33.4% respectively which indicates clearly that funds avail-
able to KDFC have been allocated to projects that are both financially and
economically viable.
General Developmental Objectives
3.07      As a private development finance institution, KDFC has endeavored
to contribute to the realization of the general economic plans and policies
of thie Government. These plans and policies are reflected in KDFC's charter
and policy statement in a list of general developmental objectives which
include inter alia (i) the promotion of export and import substituting in-
dustries; (ii) the diversification of portfolio both in terms of sectoral
and geographical distribution; (iii) the diversification of clientele through
the financing of new ventures and broadening of share capital ownership; (iv)
managerial and technical assistance to clients particularly with the aim of
improving project design; and (v) the mobilization of domestic and foreign
currency resources. KDFC's recent performance in achieving these objectives
is discussed below.
3.08      Contribution to Exports.  In line with a high priority objective
contained in its policy statement, KDFC's portfolio reflects an emphasis on
export-oriented projects. As indicated earlier, it is estimated that annual
export sales by the projects approved by KDFC up to end-1976 amount to US$600
million or about one-half of their total incremental sales. Table 3 in
Annex 3 shows the degree of export-orientation of KDFC-financed projects over
the last 4 years. Heavily export-oriented projects (i.e., projects exporting
over 50% of their output) accounted for 53% of loan approvals by amount during
that period and reached a high of 71% in 1976.
3.09      Sectoral Diversification.  Substantial changes have taken place
over the last few years in the sectoral distribution of KDFC's financing.
Tables 3, 4 and 5 of Annex 13 show that non-manufacturing industries have
gained in importance and accounted for 40% of KDFC's total outstanding port-
folio as of December 31, 1976. Since 1971, KDFC has promoted several deep-sea
fishing and marine transport projects which, because of their large financing
requirements, represent respectively 9.6% and 17.9% of its cumulative loan
approvals and over 80% of total approvals in the non-manufacturing sector.
With over two-thirds of KDFC's loan approvals since 1968, the manufacturing
sector still is predominant in KDFC's portfolio. The share of light industries
(essentially food and textile industries) has gradually declined from 43% of
KDFC's cumulative loan approvals over the period 1968-70 to about 30% for the
whole 1968-76 period; textiles however remain the largest subsector in KDFC's
loan portfolio in manufacturing. Within the heavy manufacturing sector basic
metals, transport equipment and petro-chemicals account for a low share of
KDFC's operations relative to their importance in the total gross fixed in-
vestment in Korea. Projects in these sectors are usually beyond KDFC's
financing capacity (except on a joint-financing basis) because of their
large financial requirements. KDFC's heavy industry portfolio is concen-
trated in chemicals and rubber, metal products and to a lesser extent



machinery and electrical products 1/. Machinery and electronics are two
labor- and skill-intensive activities the development of which the Govern-
ment emphasizes over the Fourth Plan period. KDFC, so far, has achieved only
modest success in its efforts to increase its assistance to these sectors.
Many projects in the field of electronics are established as joint ventures
with foreign investors, thus leaving limited scope for KDFC to have a signi-
ficant role in project formulation. Machinery projects have so far been
essentially conceived as large industrial complexes (beyond KDFC's financing
capacity) and have encountered numerous difficulties. KDFC acknowledges the
importance of the domestic machinery industry for employment creation and
import substitution; and its Development Strategy statement for 1976-77 ex-
pressly designates machinery manufacturing as a priority activity to which
KDFC plans to step up its assistance.
3.10      Regional Dispersal of Portfolio.  Excluding KDFC's financing of
the fishing and marine transport industries which can hardly be categorized
by the location of their head offices, the Seoul area proper has declined
in KDFC's operations from close to 45% of all approvals over the period
1968-70 to just under 30% on a cumulative basis over 1968-76. The share
of the surrounding Kyung-Gi province increased from 11% to 32%. The Pusan
area has marginally increased its share from 7% to nearly 9% over the same
period. This geographical distribution is in line with the evolution of
investment dispersal for Korea as a whole. As a means of contributing to
the decentralization of investment from over-crowded industrial centers, KDFC
initiated in 1976 a scheme of cooperation with some Regional Commercial Banks
(RCBs) in the less developed areas of the country. About 8% of KDFC's foreign
currency loan approvals in 1976 were allocated to the financing of projects
under this scheme.
3.11      Diversification of Clientele.  KDFC has been reasonably successful
in diversifying its clientele, whether such performance is measured by repeat
loans or by the share of the largest borrowers in KDFC's total portfolio.
Table 6 in Annex 13 shows that as of December 31, 1976, borrowers having
received more than one loan accounted for 37% (by number) of KDFC's 184
clients and repeat loans represented by amount about 59% of cumulative loans
approvals by KDFC since its inception. KDFC's exposure in any single enter-
prise is regulated by the financial prudence limits listed in its policy
statement (shown in Annex 8) 2/. These limits do provide for a reasonable
diversification of KDFC's portfolio and accordingly KDFC's ten largest bor-
rowers accounted for less than 22% of its total outstanding portfolio. In
view of the state of development of the Korean industrial sector and of KDFC's
10-year existence these ratios appear to be generally satisfactory. It was
appropriate for KDFC in the early years of its existence to attempt to build
up a sound portfolio, based on considerations of financial prudence more than
on developmental objectives. KDFC has since become increasingly involved in
1/   Including electronics.
2/   KDFC's financial commitments in whatever form to a single enterprise
cannot normally exceed 25% of KDFC's equity. Only in one case had
this limit been slightly exceeded as of December 31, 1976, and that
with the Bank's concurrence.



- 8 -
new and riskier ventures. New projects (as distinct from expansion of exist-
ing projects) which accounted for 24% of KDFC's loan approvals over the period
1968-72 reached 31% of loan approvals over the period 1971-76.
3.12      Managerial and Technical Assistance.  KDFC encourages project
sponsors to approach it at an early stage of project formulation, so as to be
in a position to make substantial contributions to project design. Annex 5
gives a selection of cases in which KDFC was instrumental in modifying proj-
ect design. In a number of cases KDFC's recommendations aimed at strengthen-
ing the financial structure of the borrowers which, beside improving the
client's debt-servicing capacity, also represented a useful contribution to
resource mobilization. As a development institution, KDFC has gone further
and has rendered advisory and consultancy services relating to three princi-
pal areas: (a) technical design, choice of technology and selection of
machinery; (b) market analysis and production plans; and (c) corporate orga-
nization and legal set-up of the proposed projects. KDFC's objective of
contributing to employment generation and to a deepening of the industrial
structure is also reflected in the list of new technologies introduced in
Korea by KDFC-financed projects. Annex 6 gives an outline of KDFC's per-
formance in this area over the last 2-year period.
3.13      Resource Mobilization.  Until 1976, KDFC had relied almost exclu-
sively on the Bank for financing its foreign currency commitments. In 1973,
however, the Government allowed KDFC to approach the Asian Development Bank
(ADB), as a means of broadening KDFC's sources of funds, and in October 1974
KDFC obtained its first loan from ADB. From its inception in 1967 to M4ay 1976,
KDFC raised a total of US$221.8 million 1/ in foreign currency, consisting
of five Bank loans totalling US$148.8 million, two ADB loans for a total of
US$70 million and a US$3 million loan from USAID.
3.14      During negotiations for the two previous Bank loans (in 1973 and
1975), the Bank urged KDFC to raise some resources from the foreign private
capital markets, so as to supplement its funds from official sources (e.g.
the Bank, ADB, et al). KDFC's efforts in that direction remained unsuccess-
ful until 1976, in part because of the difficult situation of the inter-
national capital market in 1974-75 (i.e. the unavailability of medium- and
long-term funds), compounded by the difficulties of Korea's balance of pay-
ments which severely curtailed the country's overall borrowing capacity in
those markets during that period. In 1976, however, KDFC managed to raise
its first foreign commercial loan, of about US$20 million, from its foreign
shareholders and IFC, largely with the help of IFC which acted as the manager
in syndicating that loan. Considering the difficulties inherent in this type
of resource mobilization, KDFC's performance so far has been satisfactory.
As a result of its borrowing from ADB and commercial sources, KDFC's reliance
on Bank funds has gradually been reduced, from 77% of its total assets at the
end of 1974 to 66% in 1975 and 55% in 1976.

3.15      In recognition of the fact that commercial banks (which are con-
trolled and partly funded by the Government) and KDB are in a much better
position than KDFC to satisfy the domestic currency requirements of Korean
industry, KDFC's domestic currency financing has been limited. Such a
policy was justified considering that, unlike KDB and the commercial banks,
KDFC does not have access to domestic currency deposits nor to the various
Government subsidized funds 1/. KDFC's domestic currency resources have
however been built up from W 3.35 billion 2/ at its establishment to W 12.3
billion as of December 31, 1976. Apart from cash generated from its opera-
tions in an amount of W 1.4 billion, the W 8.95 billion increase was entirely
due to equity build-up, either in the form of retained earnings (W 3.9 bil-
lion), fresh share capital issues (W 2.39 billion) for cash or stock dividends
(W 1.26 billion). KDFC's policy of broadening its equity base aims at enlarg-
ing its capacity for raising additional foreign currency borrowings rather
than at increasing its domestic currency operations. As a consequence of this
policy, KDFC has felt no need to raise additional Won resources through borrow-
ings and has enjoyed a very satisfactory level of liquidity. With the changes
currently being considered by Government which would eventually enable finan-
cial intermediaries to raise long-term private savings for relending with a
positive spread and with the reduced reliance on foreign savings envisaged in
the Fourth Plan for financing Korea's gross investment, KDFC closely watches
the domestic capital market with a view to issuing medium or long-term bonds
to expand its domestic currency operations.
3.16      Approximately one half of KDFC's domestic currency operations to
date has been in the form of short- to medium-term loans 3/ extended by KDFC
as a banking service to its borrowers of foreign currency funds. More import-
ant from KDFC's developmental viewpoint was the W 5.5 billion cumulative
approvals of investment operations (i.e. subscription to convertible deben-
tures and equity participations) through which KDFC has had a useful,
albeit marginal, effect on the distribution of corporate ownership.
3.17      Since its establishment, KDFC has played a substantial role in in-
directly mobilizing domestic savings at the project level by requiring its
borrowers to increase their equity contributions. Annex 5 contains a selection
1/   Such as the National Investment Fund (NIF) which is made available
to KDB and other eligible banking institutions by the Government for
on-lending at a subsidized rate of 13% to 14% p.a. with a 1.5% interest
spread.

of cases in which a strengthening of the financial structure was required by
KDFC as a condition of its lending.  While this was mainly aiRled at improving
the borrower's debt servicing capability, it also representred a useful contri-
bution to the mobilization of domestic resources. On1L E he foricgn currency
side, KDFC has, particularly over the last 2-vear per'od, been able to help
mobilize foreign currency resources through its joint finoncing operations
with foreign financial institutions and investors including IFC. Appendix 6
of Annex 4 shows summarized data on such operations which have contributed an
aggregate amount of US$33.9 million over the period 1975-76,
Promotional Activities
3.18      KDFC's record in implementing its general deveiop-Mentai objectives
has been remarkable, particularly in the past two to three years in the area of
promotional activities. In the earlier years of its operations KDFC followed
a somewhat passive financing policy, in view of the need to develop staff
capacity and to rapidly build up a sound portfolio, and because of the abun-
dance of entrepreuneurship in the country and the availability of well-conceived
projects seeking KDFC's financing. With the development of its staff capability,
KDFC has become increasingly involved in promotional activities. In 1975, KDFC
adopted a two-year Development Strategy statement which outlined specific pro-
motional activities on which KDFC intended to place special emphasis over the
period 1976-77.
3.19      The 1976-77 Development Strategy.  The specific proimiotional activ-
ities emphasized by KDFC in its Strategy Statement can be broadly classified
under 4 headings:
(a)  Development of the Korean financil .ystem:;  Establishment
of a leasing company to assist enterprises, particuiarly
small- and medium-scale firms, which cannot afford out-
right purchases of machinery atnld equipre,lt.
(b)  Deepening of the domestic industriai structure:  (I) increased
financial assistance to the domestic machinery manutacturing
industry; and (ii) establishment with the Korean Institute of
Technology (KIST) of a joint venture to promote new technologies
and exploit them commercially.
(c)  Diversification of KDFC's Portfolio:  (i) sectoral diversi-
fication through the promotion of agro-induistrial projects
and (ii) increased geographical dispersal with the financing
of small enterprises through selected Regional Co.mercial
Banks (RCBs) located in the less developed areas of the
country.
(d)  Foreign currency resource rmobilization:  (i) diversification
of KDFC's borrowings with the objective of lessening reliance
on official sources, and (ii) indirect mobilization through
joint-financing operations with other foreign instictutions and
investors.



- II -
3.20      Project Promotion Office.  In order to implement these promotional
activities, identify projects, and generally monitor KDFC's progress in these
areas, a separate unit, the Project Promotion Office, was set up by KDFC in
March 1975. Its staff consisted at end-January 1977 of six professionals.
KDFC's performance in implementing its promotional program is analyzed
in detail in Annex 4 and summarized below.
3.21      Korea Development Leasing Corporation.  KDFC's objective of sup-
plementing its own development banking functions through the establishment
of specialized financial intermediaries had resulted in 1971 in the creation
of the Korea Investment Finance Corporation (KIFC), a financial intermediary
engaged in money market and investment banking operations. KIFC's success
has since led to the creation of nine similar institutions, with a consequent
development of an active money market and improved mobilization of resources.
Similarly, KDFC sponsored the establishment of the Korea Development Leasing
Corporation (KDLC) which was incorporated in 1975 as a joint venture with
Orient Leasing Company (OLC) of Japan. The lease instrument is particularly
well-suited to Korean industry because the high indebtedness of enterprises has
often resulted in a lack of collateral to be pledged against additional loans.
Leasing is therefore very attractive especially to small- and medium-sized
enterprises. Furthermore, leasing can in the long run contribute substantially
to the development of the domestic capital goods industry through the leasing
of domestically manufactured machinery and equipment. Operations have expanded
rapidly, but have been hampered by KDLC's shortage of resources. In order to
alleviate this problem, KDFC requested and the Bank approved a US$5 million
sub-loan which was made available to KDLC from the proceeds of the latest Bank
loan to KDFC. This amount has been fully committed in 1976 on account of 26
leasing projects, the main characteristics of which are shown in Appendix 1
of Annex 4. Toward meeting part of its resource requirements over the coming
months, KDLC has recently completed negotiations with IFC for a minority
participation in its share capital and a loan of up to US$15 million.
3.22      K-TAC.  The Korea Technology Advancement Corporation (K-TAC) was
established in 1974 under the joint sponsorship of KDFC and of the Korea
Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) with the objective of promoting
the commercial exploitation of the patents and technical processes developed
by KIST. During the year 1976, K-TAC promoted two projects (for bronze powder
and cordierite saggar production) for which KDFC provided financial assistance
in the form of loans and equity participation. Details of these projects
appear in Appendix 2, Annex 4.
3.23      Machinery Industry.  An analysis of the capital goods manufacturing
industry in Korea by KDFC has shown that assistance to such large manufactu-
ring complexes as those of Changwon are beyond the financial and technical
means of KDFC. KDFC decided to focus its assistance on the small- and medium-
scale machinery manufacturers who possess adequate know-how. Seven such
projects have been financed over the period 1975-76, for a total of US$6.5
million, about 6% of KDFC's total lending during that period. KDFC has also
been assisting the domestic machinery manufacturing indirectly by financing
in some instances the foreign currency component of domestically procured



- 12 -
capital goods, under the latest loan, No. 1145-KO 1/. This facility has been
utilized by KDFC for a total of US$3.6 million or 6.5% of the total loan amount
(the list of these projects is given in Appendix 3, Annex 4).
3.24      Agro-Industry.  KDFC has made a start in financing industries pro-
cessing agricultural raw materials so as to encourage crop diversification and
integrate farm production into the commercial sector. KDFC's relative inex-
perience in this type of operations justified a cautious approach. Two types
of activities have been assisted by KDFC so far: viticulture and dairy pro-
duction (Appendix 4, Annex 4).
3.25      Assistance to Small Industries in Backward Areas.  In order to im-
prove the geographical dispersal of its operations and broaden its clientele,
KDFC started cooperating with selected Regional Commercial Banks (RCBs) in
the less developed areas of Southern Korea. The objective is to channel for-
eign currency funds to small enterprises in backward areas, and to help the
participating RCBs build up their appraisal and follow-up capability. Details
of the progress made and difficulties encountered are given in Appendix 5,
Annex 4. Under this scheme, cooperation agreements have been entered into with
four of the ten RCBs operating in Korea. Under these agreements, KDFC finances
the foreign currency requirements (up to US$500,000) of small industrial proj-
ects identified and appraised by the RCBs in accordance with the guidelines
issued by KDFC. The RCBs finance the domestic currency requirements of these
projects and are responsible for their follow-up. KDFC has been providing
useful training to the RCBs' staff. An initial amount of US$5 million from the
proceeds of the latest Bank loan, was fully committed by KDFC during the year
1976 on account of 18 projects under this scheme (particulars of these sub-
projects are attached to Appendix 5). In view of the encouraging response
shown by RCBs, KDFC intends to pursue and, resources permitting, to expand
this cooperation scheme to other regional banks. Additional resources have
been earmarked for 1977 out of the second ADB loan and KDFC plans to utilize
a part (still undetermined) of the proceeds of the proposed Bank loan start-
ing in the latter half of 1977.
3.26      Resource Mobilization.  As indicated earlier, KDFC has indirectly
mobilized foreign currency borrowings amounting to US$33.9 million over the
2-year period 1975-76 through its joint-financing operations with foreign
financial institutions and investors. KDFC's promotional efforts in this
area during the year 1976 focused essentially on the establishment of a US$66
million zinc smelting project financed jointly with IFC 2/ and other investors
and a steel pipe manufacturing project with the Bank of America. Appendix 6
in Annex 4 shows data on these operations. KDFC emphasized in its previous
1/   A percentage of 60% for the foreign exchange component of domestically
manufactured capital goods was agreed upon under the Bank loan.
2/   IFC's financial assistance consists of a US$13 million loan and a
US$4 million equity participation.

Strategy statement its intention to lessen its dependence on official sources
of foreign currency funds (IBRD, ADB, et al) by attempting to borrow from
foreign commercial sources. KDFC's efforts have come to fruition in May 1976
with the US$19.8 million foreign commercial loan syndicated by IFC. Foreign
commercial borrowings are important for KDFC to broaden and diversify its
resource base. They are, however, likely to account for a limited share of
KDFC's total resources in the future because of the difficulties inherent in
obtaining them and of KDFC's limited capacity to on-lend these relatively
costly commercial funds without jeopardizing its competitive position or the
profitability (see para 6.02) on which it depends for its ability to raise
new share capital.
3.27      New Developmental Objectives.  In the four main areas outlined in
its previous Strategy statement, KDFC has achieved satisfactory progress.
Capitalizing on its experience of the last 18 months, KDFC has revised and
updated its developmental and promotional strategy. A new statement of
Development Strategy has been adopted by KDFC covering the period 1977-78
(Annex 8), which proposes to consolidate and expand the past achievements.
KDFC intends in that 2-year period to focus on (i) project promotion and fund
allocation; (ii) resource mobilization; and (iii) research activities. Spe-
cifically, KDFC will continue and expand its program of cooperation with the
RCBs placing emphasis on the training of the RCBs' staff in appraisal tech-
niques and follow-up work; and further expand assistance to K-TAC. In pur-
suance of its efforts to promote the domestic machinery industry, KDFC will
establish, within its own organization, an Engineering Consulting Office
which will identify and promote new machinery projects; this office may
eventually be spun-off as a separate consulting entity. KDFC is also co-
operating with IFC in the study of a scheme of financial assistance to the
Korean machinery industry. Diversification of the source of its foreign
currency borrowings remains a primary objective of KDFC; preliminary soundings
for a second foreign commercial loan of up to US$30 million have already been
initiated, and this loan may materialize in the latter part of 1977. If mar-
ket conditions remain favorable, KDFC hopes to be able to reduce its reliance
on official sources of funds to about two-thirds of its overall resources by
1981.
3.28      KDFC's record of developmental and promotional achievements over the
last few years has been impressive. The implementation of the new objectives
contained in its Strategy statement for 1977-78 is expected to further enhance
KDFC's developmental contribution over the next few years.
V. INSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS
4.01      Share Capital and Ownership.  KDFC is a privately owned company,
with a reasonably broad-based ownership 1/. Including IFC which owns 10.5%,
foreign shareholders accounted for about 35% of KDFC's paid-in share capital
1/   Apart from IFC, no single shareholder owns more than 4% of KDFC's
share capital.

as of December 31, 1976. Apart from IFC and the German Development Corpora-
tion (DEG), a semi-public institution, the foreign shareholders are commercial
banks, most of which are from the U.S. and Japan. Among the domestic share-
holders, insurance companies, commercial banks and securities companies account
for about 25% of KDFC's share capital while industrial companies and private
individuals own a total of about 40% (Annex 9). KDFC's initial paid-in share
capital of W 1.35 billion had increased to W 5 billion by end-1976 through
stock dividends totalling W 1.26 billion and two rights issues for cash in
1973 and 1976 of W 1.02 billion and W 1.37 billion respectively. Of the latest
rights issue of 274,000 shares in November 1976, about 18% were allocated to
KDFC's staff.
4.02      Board of Directors.  KDFC has a 13-member Board including its Presi-
dent. Five Directors, including IFC's representative (Mr. N. Nishihara),
represent the foreign shareholders. The Korean Directors are leading members
of the financial and business community. Mr. C.S. Hong, a prominent indus-
trialist, has been the Board chairman since KDFC's establishment in 1967. The
Directors are elected for a term of one year and meet regularly to deal inter
alia with approvals of loans and investments exceeding US$2 million and with
operational and policy matters. Between meetings of the Board, authority to
conduct KDFC's operations and approve loans and investments under US$2 million
is delegated to an Executive Committee composed of four Board members (with
the Chairman and President serving as ex officio members). Since November
1976, KDFC's President has been given authority to approve loans and invest-
ments of up to US$300,000 under the scheme of cooperation with RCBs. Annex 10
shows the composition of the Board and Executive Committee.
4.03      MIanagement, Organization.  KDFC remains one of the best managed
DFCs with which the Bank Group is associated. Its senior management team con-
sists of a President and two Vice Presidents; each Vice President is responsi-
ble for three of KDFC's six departments. Mr. C.H. Kim, a former Governor of
rhe Bank of Korea, has been KDFC's President since 1967 and was recently re-
appointed at the latest shareholders' meeting in February 1977. He continues
to provide KDFC with his wise and capable leadership. The previous Vice
President in charge of the Administration, Operations and Accounting depart-
mrents, Mr. C.K. Lee 1/, was appointed in March 1977 as President of KDLC, a
company affiliated with KDFC (para 3.20). He was replaced by Mr. B.C. Yoon,
the former manager of the Operations Department. Mr. T.Y. Hahm, formerly
manager of the Appraisal Department, was appointed as Vice President in 1974
and is in charge of the Planning, Appraisal, and Project Promotion Departments.
In order to effectively handle the increasing accounting workload and intensify
promotional activities, two new units have been established at the departmental
level, namely a Project Promotion Office (in March 1975) and an Accounting
Office (in July 1976). All departments are headed by competent managers. At
present KDFC has no regional office. A new Engineering Consulting Office is
expected to be established in the coming months. KDFC's organization chart
is appended to this report.

4.04      Staffing.  As of end-January 1977, KDFC had a total staff of 110
including 6 managers and 65 professionals. The quality of KDFC's professional
staff, both in terms of academic and professional background, is excellent
at all levels, and is reflected in the high standard of KDFC's operations.
The competitiveness of KDFC's employment conditions still gives KDFC an edge
over other financial institutions in Korea, but has slowly been eroded in the
last few years in comparison with the large private industrial groups. Pro-
fessional staff turnover, which had been minimal until 1972, increased con-
siderably in recent years, and a total of 13 professionals 1/ left KDFC over
the last 2 years. Turnover was especially high among junior officers and
engineers. Such a level of staff turnover, however, has proven to be manage-
able by KDFC, and has had no discernible effect on the quality of its oper-
ations, no doubt because of KDFC's basic staff strength and the fact that
the turnover did not involve its key staff. The recruitment of 19 new pro-
fessionals in 1976 brought a net increase of 9 to KDFC's professional staff.
Annex 11 shows KDFC's recruitment plan for the 1977-81 period. Staff training
and development has received considerable impetus in recent years. In-house
and overseas training has generally focused on project appraisal techniques,
accounting, finance, management techniques, law, taxation, etc. In 1976, KDFC
initiated a new staff development policy for deserving young professionals
whereby overseas academic training, in disciplines relating to its business,
is financed by KDFC. Two trainees were sent to the U.S. in 1976 for training
in business administration.
4.05      Operational Policies.  Guidelines for KDFC's operations are set
forth in its Statement of Investment and Operational Policies which has been
updated and revised from time to time since its adoption by KDFC's Board of
Directors in 1967. No substantial amendments have been made since the last Bank
appraisal except with respect to (i) increasing the debt/equity limit to 8.5
times the aggregate paid-in capital and free reserves in January 1976 and (ii)
increasing KDFC's maximum financial exposure limit to 25% of the total sum of
its paid-in capital and free reserves. Both changes received the Bank concur-
rence. To supplement these general guidelines, and set out its immediate
developmental and promotional objectives, KDFC adopted in 1975 a statement
of Development Strategy for the period 1976-77 which has now been revised and
updated for 1977-78 (para 3.26).
4.06      Project Appraisal.  The standards of KDFC's project appraisal work
continue to be very high. KDFC's appraisal reports, because of their quality,
have often been used as models and training materials not only for other
Korean institutions, but for many overseas DFCs. The technical, marketing,
and financial aspects are usually analysed thoroughly, and, since 1973, KDFC
routinely calculates the economic rate of return on all the projects it fi-
nances. KDFC continues to draw substantially on the expertise of the Korean
Institute of Science and Technology, which holds a participation in KDFC's
share capital. KDFC intends to further improve its coverage of the tech-
nological aspects of projects with the contemplated establishment of the
Engineering Consulting Office (para 3.26).

4.07      Project Supervision.  In spite of staff constraints, particu-
larly in terms of engineering staff, the Operations Department, which is in
charge of project follow-up, has been considerably strengthened over the years.
Reporting requirements are outlined in KDFC's loan agreements and are strictly
enforced. Annual audit reports are required from clients and are used as the
basis of an annual follow-up report on each project which analyses sales and
price trends, market shares, liquidity and earnings ratios, etc. In addition,
plant visits are carried out by the follow-up staff at time intervals depending
on the project's performance 1/. The Operations Department systematically
analyses actual project costs and benefits for comparison with earlier appraisal
estimates; the results of such analyses 2/ speak very well of the quality of
KDFC's appraisal work. The Operations Department is also in charge of procure-
ment, supervision of disbursements, collateral, loan collections, and makes
recommendations to management for action on problem projects. These recommend-
ations range from additional financial assistance for projects experiencing
severe cost overruns, to loan reschedulings or the suspension of disbursements.
KDFC's follow-up procedures are thorough. The absence of arrears in excess
of three months over the last two years (para 5.07) attests to the quality
of KDFC's appraisal and supervision work.
4.08      Procurement and Disbursement.  KDFC's procurement and disbursement
procedures are appropriate. KDFC normally requires that its borrowers submit
at least three competitive quotations from suppliers and sometimes, depending
on the type of equipment and size of the contract, insists on international
competitive bidding (ICB). The merits of the various offers are evaluated
jointly by the sub-borrower and the Operations Department. The final procure-
ment contract is subject to KDFC's approval. Disbursements are authorized
against submission of satisfactory documents and progress reports on project
implementation.
V. OPERATIONS
5.01      Foreign Currency Lending Operations.  Foreign currency lending
accounted for 88.3% of KDFC's total financial assistance from its inception
to end-1976. Cumulative loan approvals in foreign currency amounted to
US$213.1 million as of December 31, 1976 on account of 254 loans. KDFC's
foreign currency lending increased from US$17.4 million in 1972 to US$64.7
million in 1976 on an approval basis, which represents an average annual
1/   In 1976 approximately 120 field visits have been made by the 14 follow-
up officers of the Operations Department.
2/   A study of a sample of 26 projects financed in 1975 and 1976 showed cost
overruns and underruns varying between 0.3% and 36% in comparison with
earlier estimates, with an average margin of error of about 6%, despite
world wide inflationary trends.



- 17 -
growth of 39%. On a year-to-year basis however the growth has not been re-
gular; the level of approvals has been a direct function of resource avail-
ability. There was for instance a 12% decline in foreign currency approvals
in 1974 as a result of the delay in effectiveness of the first ADB loan. This
decline was followed by a 79% increase in 1975 when KDFC's foreign exchange
resources were replenished by both its first ADB loan (effective October 1974)
and the latest Bank loan (effective August 1975). In 1976, the growth in the
volume of foreign currency approvals was 51%, partly as a result of the avail-
ability of the US$20 million IFC syndicated loan.
5.02      Domestic Currency Operations.  KDFC's aggregate approvals in domestic
currency for the period 1968-76 amounted to W 12.4 billion (US$25.6 million).
Loans in domestic currency accounted for 56% of this amount, while subscrip-
tion to convertible debentures and equity participations represented respec-
tively 18% and 27%. As indicated earlier, KDFC makes short- and medium-term
loans in domestic currency essentially as a service to its borrowers of foreign
currency. KDFC considers that KDB and the commercial banks are, because of the
resources available to them, better equipped to handle domestic currency lending.
Priority is therefore given in KDFC's domestic currency operations to investment
operations (i.e., convertible debentures and equity participations as distinct
from straight lending) through which it can achieve a more substantial develop-
mental impact. Investment operations which accounted for 40% of KDFC's total
domestic currency operations in 1974 increased to 76% in 1976. Nine new equity
participations have been approved in 1976 for a total of W 1 billion (US$2.1
million) bringing KDFC's total outstanding equity investment portfolio as of
December 31, 1976 to W 3.3 billion in 21 companies. KDFC's operations up to
end-1976 are summarized in Annex 13, Table 1.
5.03      Financial Position.  A detailed analysis of KDFC's financial posi-
tion and performance is presented in Annex 14 together with tables showing
KDFC's audited accounts for the last 4 years. As of December 31, 1976, KDFC's
total assets stood at W 87.8 billion (US$181 million) having increased by 66%
during the year. This unprecedented assets growth reflected the delayed effect
on disbursements of the rapid increase in total approvals in 1975 and 1976.
Total disbursements showed an increase of 178% in 1976 over their 1975 level,
which, after allowing for collections, brought about a 60% increase in out-
standing portfolio. This growth of KDFC's portfolio was essentially on
account of foreign currency loans which have increased from 70% of total
assets in 1973 to 81% in 1976.
5.04      The growth of the foreign currency loan portfolio was financed by
rapid draw downs on KDFC's foreign currency resources 1/. While total out-
standing term debt inclusive of domestic currency borrowings (i.e. the su-
bordinated Government loan) increased by 97% over the period 1975-76, KDFC's
equity grew by 57% only, from W 6.1 billion to W 9.6 billion. The debt/equity
1/   Both increasing by 67% in 1976.



- 18 -
ratio consequently increased from 6.1:1 to 7.7:1, still within the contractual
limit of 8.5:1. Part of the increase in KDFC's equity came from the November
1976 rights issue for cash of W 1.37 billion (para 4.01). The current ratio 1/
has decreased from 1.8 in 1974 to 1.5 in 1976 but still leaves KDFC with a
comfortable liquidity position. The debt service coverage has remained at the
level of 1.3 times over the last 2 years which is satisfactory.
5.05      Earnings Performance.  KDFC's net income for 1976 reached W 1.55
billion, an increase of 27% over the previous year. Net income has increased
at an average rate of 30% p.a. over the last 2 years. Loan income represents
about 85% of KDFC's total gross income. Administrative expenses have continued
to decline as a percentage of average total assets from 1.6% in 1974 to 1.4%
and 1.2% respectively in 1975 and 1976, which is a good indicator of the effi-
ciency of KDFC's operation. Income growth has been more than offset by rapidly
increasing financial expenses which have caused a marginal reduction in KDFC's
gross spread. As a consequence, net income has slightly declined as a percent-
age of average total assets from 2.5% to 2.2%. A higher leverage has however
raised returns to average net worth from 15.8% in 1974 to 18.7% in 1976. The
level of KDFC's earnings has remained adequate to allow for both dividends and
increases in retained earnings.
5.06      Share Prices and Dividends.  The book value of KDFC's shares
stood at W 9,581 per share as of December 31, 1976 as against a par value
of W 5,000. The market value of KDFC's shares, which are lightly traded,
has fluctuated between W 7,200 and W 6,000 in 1976. Except in 1973 when it
declared a 15% cash dividend, KDFC's dividend policy since 1970 has been to
declare a 10% cash and a 10% stock dividend every year. In 1976, however, a
20% cash dividend was declared following the November 1976 rights issue, which
is roughly in line with the dividend policy of other private financial insti-
tutions in Korea, but well below the level of cash dividends usually dis-
tributed by private industries. The pay-out ratio averaged 39% over the last
four years and reached 48.5% in 1976, which is still moderate.
5.07      Quality of Portfolio.  KDFC's portfolio is of exceptionally good
quality. Table 4 in Annex 14 summarizes KDFC's collection performance and
arrears situation over the last four years.  KDFC experienced its first
arrears problems in 1972 with six loans in arrears for over 3 months at the
end of the year. The financial measures taken by Government in August 1972
coupled with KDFC's intensified collection efforts had reduced arrears to two
loans by end-1973. No loan was in arrears for a period of more than 3 months
at year end-1975 and 1976. Collection ratios over the last 4 years ranged from
98.2% to 99.4% reflecting a nearly perfect performance. Since its establish-
ment, KDFC has had to foreclose mortgages on two loan accounts in 1972 and
1/   Including current portions of loans and term debt.



- 19 -
1975; amounts written off on these two accounts amounted to a total of W 88
million. No reschedulings were made in 1976 1/. With some 60% of KDFC's out-
standing loan portfolio still in grace period, the re-emergence of some arrears
should be expected in the future. Provisions for doubtful accounts stood at
W 1.1 billion as of December 31, 1976 and together with free reserves accounted
for 7.7% of total portfolio, which is more than adequate. The exceptional
soundness of KDFC's portfolio is attributable more to the quality of its
appraisal and follow-up work, to its ability to identify and remedy problem
projects at an early stage, and, more importantly, to the strength of the
Korean economy particularly in the last two years, rather than to any overly
conservative lending policy on KDFC's part.
5.08      Terms and Conditions of Lending.  The lending rates currently charged
by KDFC are shown in Table 1, Annex 1. Although the Government does not formal-
ly regulate the level of KDFC's interest rates, these are expected to be in
line with those of other financial and banking institutions in Korea. On the
domestic currency side, lending rates have been broadly aligned on the level
of the standard banking rates which was adjusted upward on August 2, 1976
(paragraph 27, Annex 1). The interest rate now stands at 20% p.a. while 18%
p.a. is charged for priority 2/ projects. On the foreign currency side, KDFC's
standard interest rate applicable is 10.75% p.a, with differential rates of
10.5% to 11% p.a. being applied in consideration of the degree of contri-
bution to the economy 3/ of a project and of the credit standing of the bor-
rower. Of all the subloans approved by KDFC under the latest Bank loan approx-
imately 87% were charged a rate of 10.75%, 10% a rate of 10.5%, and 3% a rate
of 11%. On the subloans financed from the proceeds of the IFC syndicated
foreign commercial loan, KDFC charges an interest spread of 1-1/4 percentage
points above its average borrowing rate; the relending rate is currently set
at 10.97% p.a. For all its foreign currency loans, KDFC passes on the foreign
exchange risk to the subborrowers. MIaturities generally are five years for
domestic currency loans and 7 to 12 years for foreign currency loans.
5.09      Audit.  KDFC's accounts have, for the past two years, been audited
by the Lybrand Accounting Corporation, which is associated with the Coopers
& Lybrand Group. Their reports meet the Bank's requirements. KDFC's accounts
have always been certified without qualification.
1/   In 1975 the repayment schedules of 3 loans with a total principal
outstanding of W 1 million (US$2,000) were extended by one year.
2/   Priority projects are defined in the Law on Tax Deduction and Exemption
as power, petrochemical, shipbuilding, machinery, electronics, steel,
non-ferrous metals, mining, and fertilizer industries.
3/   A high degree of contribution to the economy is accorded to (i) priority
projects as defined above; and (ii) industries listed in KDFC's Develop-
ment Strategy statement.

VI. PROSPECTS AND RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
6.01      Business Prospects.  KDFC's operational projections and business
forecasts are analyzed in Annex 15. KDFC estimates that over the two-year
period starting mid-1977 its total financial assistance (loans and investments)
will reach W 79.2 billion (US$163.3 million) on a commitment basis. Foreign
currency loans are projected to account for US$147 million or 90% of total com-
mitments. Approvals which had increased by 51% in 1976, because of the expe-
ditious processing of loan applications financed from the proceeds of the
US$20 million IFC syndicated loan, are projected to grow by a moderate 9.5%
in 1977 and 19% in 1978. The Fourth Five-Year Plan is projecting an annual
real growth of industrial investment of about 8% over the period 1977-81.
KDFC's disbursements over the same period are forecast to increase at an
average rate of just under 15% p.a.. Assuming a reduction in the rate of
inflation to about 7% p.a., the real growth in KDFC's disbursements would
work out at approximately 8% p.a., thus keeping pace with the projected real
growth of industrial investment over the Plan period. KDFC should therefore
be in a position to maintain roughly the share of its financing of industrial
investment at the same level as in the last five-year period, or approximately
3%. The achievement of this larger volume of business would depend primarily
on KDFC's capacity to raise additional borrowings. In view of the debt/equity
limitation (para 6.03), KDFC's borrowing capacity will itself depend on its
ability to expand its equity base.
6.02      Financial Forecasts.  KDFC's financial performance and structure are
expected to remain quite satisfactory over the next five years. Profits after
tax are projected to increase from an expected W 2.1 billion in 1977 to W 4.4
billion in 1981, a growth rate of approximately 20% p.a.. Net income as a per-
centage of both average equity and average total assets is expected to mar-
ginally decline from the 1976 level 1/ owing to a slight erosion of the inte-
rest spread. In fact, an increase is projected in gross income (from 10.9% of
average total assets in 1976 to 11.6% by 1981) which would, however, be more
than offset by a rise in KDFC's average interest expenses (from 6.5% to 7.7%).
The projected increase in financial charges reflects the expected proportionate
reduction in official funds (such as those from IBRD and ADB) and the increased
share of higher-cost foreign commercial borrowings. KDFC envisages continuing
its usual policy of declaring a 20% dividend (10% cash; 10% stock). A 10% cash
dividend is rather conservative by Korean standards and KDFC may need to adjust
its future dividend policy in order to strike an appropriate balance between the
objective of increasing cash returns to its shareholders to render future share
issues more attractive, on the one hand, and the need to expand the equity
base through retained earnings and stock dividends, on the other. KDFC's debt
service coverage is expected to remain at the satisfactory level of 1.2 to 1.3
through the projected period. The interest cover ratio would marginally decline
from 1.4 in 1976 to 1.3 by 1979 which would still be adequate. On the whole
KDFC's profitability is expected to remain satisfactory.
i/   Respectively from 18.7% in 1976 to 18.3% in 1981 and from 2.2% in 1976
to 1.9% in 1981.



- 21 -
6.03      Debt/Equity Limit.  KDFC's total assets are projected to           from
W 87.8 billion at end-1976 to W 260 billion by 1981, a rate of increase of
close to 25% p.a.. This increase will be financed by a corresponding 25% p.a.
rise in term liabilities; equity growth, however, will be slightly lower (at
about 23% p.a. on average over the same period) thus bringing the debt/equity
ratio up from 7.7:1 in 1976 to 8.2:1 by 1981. Contrary to the growth of its
portfolio and borrowings, the increase in KDFC's equity (and therefore in the
debt/equity ratio) will not be uniform from year to year since it will partially
be on account of two large share issues for cash of W 3 billion and W 4 billion
respectively planned for 1978 and 1981. In the years preceding these share
issues the debt/equity ratio would reach 8.48:1 and 9.3:1 (in 1977 and 1980
respectively). At end-1977 the ratio is expected to come quite close to
the existing contractual limit of 8.5:1. This limit could even be exceeded,
if the second commercial loan expected in early 1978 were to materialize
ahead of schedule. KDFC realizes the need to broaden its equity base as the
best means of easing this constraint. It feels however, that the planned
share issues of W 3 billion and W 4 billion for 1978 and 1981 represent the
maximum that it can raise following the W 1.37 billion increase of November
1976. Furthermore KDFC takes the view that a more conservative dividend policy
in order to achieve a higher level of retained earnings and stock dividends
would be unacceptable to its shareholders and could jeopardize the success of
its future share issues. An increase in the contractual debt/equity limitation
from 8.5:1 to 10:1, which would enable KDFC to incur the additional borrowings
required for financing its operations over the next few years, is therefore
recommended, on the grounds of KDFC's strong management and staff, the high
standards of its operation and the soundness of its financial position and of
its portfolio which is free of arrears.
6.04      Won Resource Position and Requirements.  KDFC's resource position
as of December 31, 1976, is shown in Annex 16. Domestic currency commitments
for the two-year period 1977-78 are estimated to amount to W 7.9 billion.
At end-1976 domestic currency resources available for commitment amounted
to W 3.3 billion. KDFC expects to raise a further W 3 billion through its
1978 share capital increase, and W 5.9 billion through Won loan collections,
disposition of equity investments and internal cash generation 1/. These
additional domestic currency resources should enable KDFC to cover projected
commitments and at the same time maintain a satisfactory level of liquidity.
6.05      Foreign Exchange Resource Position and Requirements.  Uncommitted
foreign currency resources amounted to US$39.3 million as of December 31,
1976, consisting of US$7.1 million from the previous Bank loan and US$32.2
million from the latest ADB loan. This uncommitted balance is expected to
be fully utilized by the middle of 1977. Commitments over the two-year period
starting July 1, 1977 are estimated to reach US$147 million. In order to meet
1/   Accounting respectively for W 2.2 billion, W 0.3 billion and W 3.4
billion.



- 22 -
this level of commitments and maintain an adequate balance of resources avail-
able for approvals, KDFC will need to borrow a total of US$150 million. The
proposed US$70 million Bank loan would cover slightly less than one half of
KDFC's requirements with the balance to be met by another loan of US$50 mil-
lion from ADB (expected in late 1978), and a foreign commercial loan of about
US$30 million from its foreign shareholders to be raised with IFC's assistance.
VII. THE LOAN OBJECTIVES AND MAIN FEATURES
7.01      Objectives of the Loan.  The Bank Group's association with KDFC
since the latter's inception in 1967 has been a productive and mutually
beneficial one. Through KDFC as an intermediary, Bank Group resources
(totalling US$161.3 million, on a commitment basis and including the IFC
syndicated loan) have been efficiently allocated to some 215 projects which
are economically as well as financially viable, in the manufacturing, mining,
agro-industrial, tourism and transport sectors of the Korean economy. This
association has enabled the Bank Group to exert its influence in encouraging
KDFC to sustain and improve its operational standards as well as to enhance
its developmental contribution. It is expected that over the period of com-
mitment of the proposed loan, KDFC will achieve further improvements from both
the institutional and developmental points of view.
7.02      Economic Justification.  As indicated in paragraph 3.05 the weighted
average economic rate of return on a large sample of KDFC-financed projects
was 33.4%. Subloans to the projects approved so far under the previous Bank
loan ranged in size between US$110,000 and US$3.95 million 1/; economic rates
of return ranged from 15% to 67%. Subprojects to be financed under the pro-
posed loan, although not yet identified are expected to yield similar economic
benefits. As with the previous Bank loan a proportion of up to 10% of the
proposed loan is expected to be utilized by KDFC for financing small-scale
industries in backward areas with the Regional Commercial Banks. As an inter-
mediary for allocating Bank funds to projects smaller than the Bank could
Linance directly, KDFC's performance has been, and is expected to remain very
effective.
Main Features of the Loan
7.03      Utilization of Loan Proceeds.  Aside from the financing of direct
imports of machinery and equipment, KDFC would be authorized to use the pro-
ceeds of the proposed loan to finance the foreign exchange component of do-
mestically procured capital goods estimated at 60% and that of local civil
works estimated at 35%. Financing of the foreign exchange component of local
procurement was already allowed under the previous Bank loan to KDFC and
accounted for about 6.5% of the total loan amount. This proportion is ex-
pected to increase slightly under the proposed loan.
7.04      Relending Rate.  As under the previous Bank loan (para 5.08)
KDFC expects to relend the proceeds of the proposed loan at an average inte-
rest rate of 10.75% p.a.. In practice, differential rates of 10.5% to 11%
1/   With an average subloan size of US$941,000.



- 23 -
p.a. will be applied depending on the degree of contribution to the economy
of subprojects. The 10.75% rate will give KDFC a spread of 2.25% (assuming
a Bank lending rate of 8.5%), which is appropriate. Considering that KDFC's
borrowers will bear the foreign exchange risk, which has averaged 7% per annum
over the period 1968-76, the proposed nominal relending rate of 10.75% repre-
sents an effective rate of 17.75% which does not appear unduly low.
7.05      Free Limit.  On the basis of KDFC's high appraisal standards and the
proven ability of its management and staff, it is recommended that the free
limit be increased from the level of US$2 million (under the previous Bank
loan) to US$2.5 million. WJith the proposed free limit, it is estimated that
projects accounting for about 15% of the total number of subloans and about
40% of the total loan amount would still require Bank review prior to approval,
which would be adequate. As with the previous loan there would be no aggregate
free limit. No ceiling on the size of individual subloans is necessary since
KDFC's Policy Statement provides for a statutory exposure limit in a single
enterprise of 25% of KDFC's net worth which represented about US$5 million as
of December 31, 1976.
7.06      Amortization Schedule.  As usual with Bank loans to DFCs the pro-
posed loan would have a flexible amortization schedule which would conform
substantially to the aggregate of the repayment schedules of the subloans
made by KDFC to its clients. The loan is expected to be fully repaid within
a period of seventeen years including a grace period of about 3 years. The
estimated disbursement schedule of the loan is shown in Annex 17.
VIII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AT NEGOTIATIONS
8.01      During negotiations, agreements were reached on the following:
(a) a new debt/equity limit of 10.0:1 (paragraph 6.03);
(b) a percentage of 60 for financing the foreign exchange
component of domestic equipment and 35 for local civil
works (paragraph 7.03); and
(c) a new free limit of US$2.5 million (paragraph 7.05).

KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Economic, Industrial and Financial Environment
A. The Korean Economy
1.        The Econnmic Setting.  Over the last 15 years Korea's economy has
maintained an averaie real growth of about 10% p.a., which has transformed
Korea from one of -he poorest developing countries with heavy dependence on
agriculture, and a relatively poor endowment of natural resources, into a
semi-industrialized middle income nation with an increasingly strong ex-
ternal payments po:;ition. Over the Third Five-Year Plan period (1972-1976)
the GNP growth rate reached an average of 11% p.a. in real terms. Even
during the recessionary years of 1974 and 1975 when Korea was hard hit by
the energy crisis and worldwide recession which slowed down the growth of
its exports, Korea's GNP grew by more than 8% p.a.; for 1976, GNP growth is
estimated at over 15%. The impressive 1976 performance resulted from an in-
crease of more than 40% in the volume of exports during that year aided by
a very good performance in the agricultural sector. The engine of growth
of the Korean economy over the last 15 years has been the rapid expansion
of exports from less than US$200 million in 1965 (9% of GNP) to nearly US$8
billion by 1976 (36% of GNP), an average real rate of growth of over 33% p.a.
Korea was able to nearly double the volume of its exports between 1973 and
1976 in spite of a relatively slow growth in world trade. Manufactured ex-
ports have played a dominant role in the process of export expansion and their
share in total merchandise exports rose from 80% in 1965 to 90% in 1976. Some
progress has been achieved in diversifying the commodity structure of exports
and moving in the direction of more sophisticated skill-intensive products,
nevertheless, more than half of Korea's manufactured exports consists of
textiles, clothing and footwear and only a little over a quarter consists
of heavy manufactures. Over the last 15 years, the average growth rate of
production in the mining and manufacturing sector has been with 19% p.a. al-
most twice as high as the 10% aggregate growth rate of GNP. As a consequence,
the share of mining and manufacturing has risen from 12% of GNP in 1961 to an
estimated 36% by 1976. Korea's remarkable success in expanding its exports
has been made possible by the very fast growth of investment. Fixed invest-
ment rose from about 11% of GNP in 1960 to more than 20% by 1966 and has
generally been about 23% to 26% of GNP since then. Fixed investment in
mining and manufacturing accounted for 24.6% of total investment outlays
over the Third Plan period.



ANNEX 1
Page 2
2.        After the 1973 unprecedented boom which resulted in a real GNP
growth of 16.1% 1/ and an increase in the volume of export of 54%, a reces-
sionary period followed during 1974-75 with sharply rising import prices and
depressed export demand.  The Government's response to a sharply increased
inflation, 2/ rising unemployment, and the rapid drawdown of Korea's foreign
exchange reserves, included a 17.5% devaluation of the Won in December 1974,
gradual adjustment of domestic prices towards world market levels, intensive
export promotion, and additional financial assistance to Korean enterprises
to allow the build up of manufacturing inventories. The deterioration in
Korea's terms of trade reached about 19% in 1974 and another 10% in 1975.
From mid-1975 the world economy began to show signs of recovery and the level
of exports which had continued to be sluggish in the first half of the year
picked up. As a consequence, exports reached US$5 billion for the whole year,
a 12% increase over the previous year. GNP growth in real terms which had
slowed down to 8.6% in 1974 reached only 7.9% in 1975.
3.        The measures taken by the Government to smooth the impact of the
recession allowed a continued growth in fixed investment during the period
1974-75, and enabled Korean exporters to take full advantage of the recovery
in export markets which started in the latter half of 1975 and reached full
development in 1976.
4.        Performance in 1976.  The Korean economy performed remarkably well
in 1976. GNP is estimated to have grown in real terms 3/ by 15.2%, second
only to the exceptional 16.7% recorded in 1973. This growth was brought about
by the sharp expansion of exports which increased in volume by more than 40%
during the year. 4/ The value of exports reached an estimated US$7.8 billion
while imports rose to US$8.1 billion, thus resulting in a trade deficit of
about US$300 million (which compares with a level of US$1.7 billion in 1975).
During the year 1976, the ratio of gross domestic investment to GNP has re-
mained roughly at its 1975 level of 27%. Domestic savings on the other hand
have increased from 18% a year earlier to 21% of GNP in 1976 thus financing
approximately 80% of gross investment. Wholesale prices are estimated to
have increased by only 9% during 1976 on a year-end basis.
5.        Objectives of the Fourth Five-Year Plan.  Along with the general
objectives of further strengthening Korea's balance of payments and maintain-
ing a rapid growth of employment, a major goal of the Fourth Five-Year Plan's
industrial policy is to achieve a structural shift within the manufacturing
sector towards more skill-intensive sectors such as machinery and electronics
where Korea enjoys a competitive advantage over other developing countries.

2/   Wholesale prices increased by nearly 80% over that period.
3/   Based on 1970 constant market prices.
4/   In 1972 and 1973 the export volume increased respectively by 46% and 54%.



ANNEX 1
Page 3
This strategy will also help deepen the structure of the industrial sector.
Over the five-year period of the Plan, the GNP is expected to grow at a
rate of 9.2% per annum fueled by a 16.5% annual growth in the volume of
manufactured exports. The manufacturing sector which now accounts for 32%
of GNP is expected to increase at 14.2% p.a., a higher rate of growth than
that of GNP, which would bring the contribution of the mining and manufac-
turing sector to 41% of GNP by 1981. It is expected that some 38% of the two
million new jobs to be created during the Fourth Five-Year Plan period will
be in the mining and manufacturing sector. As in previous years, Korea's
development would essentially be export-led, the ratio of commodity exports
to GNP which reached 27% in 1975 would rise to 42% by 1981. However, compared
to their real growth rate of 32% p.a. over the period of 1965-75 exports
are projected to increase at a more modest 16.8% p.a. The Plan is based on
the assumption that Korea's exports of textiles, clothing and other light
manufactures have a limited growth potential and are subject to encroachment
by other developing countries. Korea's comparative advantage will therefore
increasingly lie in industries which require more skilled labour and greater
industrial sophistication such as machinery, electronics and shipbuilding.
The real growth of exports of these products would be around 30% p.a. over
the 1976-81 period. The share of manufactures is expected to rise from
about 85% of total merchandise exports in 1975 to 92% by 1981. In order
to sustain the projected GNP growth rate of 9.2% p.a., gross fixed investment
would need to rise at 7.8% p.a. In relation to GNP, the projected investment
is slightly lower than in the Third Plan period (26.2% of GNP as against 26.9%
during the 1972-1976 period). The share of manufacturing investment in total
gross fixed investment is projected to increase by only 2% from its average
share of 24.6% during the Third Five-Year Plan to 26.7% during the Fourth
Five-Year Plan. The shift in Korea's export strategy towards more skill-
intensive exports is reflected in both the planned structure of industrial
output and in projected investment allocations. The share of heavy and chem-
ical industries is expected to rise from 43% of total manufacturing value
added in 1975 to nearly 52% by 1981. Investment in light industries is ex-
pected to decrease from 40% of total investment outlays in the manufacturing
sector over the Third Plan period to 36% over the next five years; conversely,
investment in the heavy and chemical industries would increase from 60% to
64%. The share of highly capital intensive industries such as basic metals,
shipbuilding and chemicals would be reduced in relative terms from approxi-
mately 75% of investment outlays in heavy and chemical industries over the
Third Plan period to 61% over the Fourth Five-Year period. Investment in
machinery and electronics would concurrently increase from 25% to 39%.
B. Industrial Sector
6.        The Role of Industry in the Economy.  Since the early 1960's, manu-
facturing has been the fastest growing sector in the Korean economy. Over
the last five years, its growth reached nearly 19% p.a., almost twice as much
as the rate of growth of the aggregate GNP. Manufacturing contributed about
52% of the increase in GNP during that period and grew in relation to GNP from



ANNEX 1
Page 4
24.4% in 1971 to 36% in 1976. 1/ The share of manufactures is estimated at
90% of commodity exports in 1976, compared to 82% in 1965. With close to
three million persons employed, the manufacturing sector accounted for about
21% of the total labour force in 1976. In spite of the increased importance
of relatively capital intensive industries such as steel, petrochemicals and
shipbuilding in Korea's gross manufacturing output, the manufacturing sector
accounted for only 24.6% of total investment outlays over the 1972-76 period,
and there has been no perceptible increase over the last 10 years in the
incremental capital-output ratio in the manufacturing sector which remained
at 1.3. 1/ Over the last decade the average cost of job creation in the
manufacturing sector has been stable at about US$5,000 in 1975 prices.
7.        Current Performance.  Value added in the manufacturing sector is
estimated to have increased by 26% in real terms 1/ in 1976 compared to 12%
in 1975 and a record growth of 31% in 1973. Exports have increased by more
than 40% in volume during the year 1976. Demand for Korea's traditional ex-
ports of light industrial products such as textile yarns, fabrics, and cloth-
ing continued to expand and maintained a share of about 35% of total commodity
exports. The concentration of Korea's exports toward the U.S. and Japan has
been substantially reduced as a result of its efforts to develop other markets
such as Europe and the Middle East; by 1976 the combined share of the U.S.
and Japan had dropped to 56% from a level of 70% in 1974. Commodity exports
to the Middle East which were earlier negligible amounted to more than US$300
million in 1975 and Korea has been winning construction contracts, mostly
in the Middle East, worth about US$2.5 billion in 1976.
8.        Structure of Industry.  The following table shows the changes which
have taken place in the structure of industry between the years 1971 and
1975:

Within light manufacturing industries, food processing has declined from 29%
of total manufacturing value added in 1971 to 20% in 1975, while textile,
footwear and leather increased from 23% to 32%, due to the buoyancy of these
traditional export items. The change in the pattern of exports, towards more
sophisticated items has been a slow one, because of the continued demand for
light exports. Consequently, the share of light manufactures in total manu-
facturing value added has only marginally decreased from close to 67% in 1971
to about 64% in 1975. The share of heavy manufactures in manufacturing value
added has conversely risen from about 31% in 1971 to close to 34% in 1975.



ANNEX 1
Page 6
Chemicals, petroleum and coal still account for the largest share of heavy
manufactures but the expansion of these industries has been slower than the
overall growth in manufacturing value added and their contribution to total
manufacturing value added has consequently declined from 18% to 14%. Basic
metals and metal products have roughly maintained their share. A substantial
increase has taken place in the share of transport from 4% to 6% and more
strikingly in the share of machinery which has risen from 5% of manufacturing
value added to close to 10%. Machinery manufacturing has had the highest
growth rate within the manufacturing sector with an average of 37% p.a.

tribution of manufacturing firms by size of employment in 1974.

Of the 24,000 industrial enterprises operating in Korea in 1974, 95% belonged
to the small- and medium-size category. 1/ These enterprises, however,
accounted for only 37% of industrial employment and 25% of industrial value
added. The sectoral distribution within the small, medium and large sector
is quite similar although the proportion of enterprises involved in the che-
mical, petroleum, oil and plastics industries is naturally slightly higher
in the medium and large categories. This clearly indicates that small and
medium industries in Korea are competitive with large scale enterprises and
perform important ancillary functions. The contribution of the small- and
medium-scale enterprises to Korea's exports has increased from 32% in 1970
to 34% in 1975, which is another indicator of their economic viability. The
relative importance of small- and medium-size enterprises in the overall in-
dustrial structure has however been declining as the Korean economy expanded
1/   Small and medium industries are defined in the Small Industry Basic
Act as enterprises with less than 200 workers or with total assets of
less than W 50 million. (This definition was revised upwards in
January 1977). For convenience, small industry is defined here as
enterprises with 5-49 workers and medium industry as enterprises with
50-200 workers.



ANNEX 1

and modernized. Small and medium industries which accounted for 59% of
employment and 39% of industrial value added in 1967 had seen their contri-
bution decline by 1974 to respectively 37% and 25%. In spite of the empha-
sis placed on developing the heavy and chemical industries which will fur-
ther increase the relative importance of large-scale enterprises, Govern-
ment is aware of the beneficial effect that small and medium industries
have on employment generation, income distribution and geographical dis-
persal of investment and has been recently intensifying its efforts to
promote these industries.
10.       Geographical distribution.  Approximately one-third of the popula-
tion of Korea is concentrated in the three largest cities of Seoul, Pusan
and Taegu. As indicated in the following table the regional distribution
of industry follows the same pattern.

There has been no significant change in the geographical distribution of
industry between 1971 and 1974 and Seoul and Pusan remain the largest in-
dustrial centers in Korea. The Government, however, has become increasingly
aware of the need to achieve, through a wider geographical dispersal, a better
distribution of employment opportunities and a reduction of the congestion
and overcrowding in Seoul and Pusan. The Government has therefore been pro-
moting the development of industrial centers outside these two areas prin-
cipally through the establishment of free trade zones and industrial estates.
Major examples of this policy are the iron and steel plants in Pohang, the
petrochemical complex in Ulsan, the integrated chemical industry in Yeosu,
and the machinery center at Changwon.
11.       Financial position.  The interest rate structure and slowdown in
economic activity during the period 1970-72 had resulted in a deterioration
of the financial position and structure of business enterprises. Companies
had become highly dependent on the high cost short-term "curb market" for
their financing. In August 1972, a Presidential decree froze all loans from
the unorganized money market and new measures were adopted which lengthened
maturities of certain loans, reduced interest rates to 16.8% p.a. and con-
verted loans from shareholders into equity. These measures as well as the



ANNEX 1
Page 8
remarkable ,,   ;miance of the Korean economy in 1973 resulted in a con-
siderable imprgement of c'io financial position and performance of Korean
enterprises. The aggregate debt/equity ratio of manufacturing enterprises
fell from 3.9 in 1971 to 3.1 in 1972 and 2.7 in 1973. The average interest
rate on borrowings of manufacturing enterprises concurrently declined from
13.4% to 8.6%. Profitability also improved markedly with net profits
increasing from an average of 1% of total assets in 1971 to 7.9% in 1973.
With the quadrupling of oil prices at end-1973 and sharp increases in the
costs of raw materials enterprises were again subject to considerable finan-
cial strains. Capacity utilization declined and costs of production in-
creased substantially.  In an effort to sustain the economic activity and
employment, the Government helped filnance the build-up of manufacturing
inventories. Enterprises had to resort to increased borrowings and the
aggregate debt/equity ratio increased to 3.2 in 1974 and 3.4 in 1975. Pro-
fitability decreased with net income declining as a percentage of total
assets from 7.9% in 1973 to 5.7% and 3.9% respectively in 1974 and 1975.
12.       Industrial development strategy.  Export orientation has been the
dominant factor influencing the structure and rate of expansion of the manu-
facturing sector. Export growth has been accompanied by a policy of selective
import-substitution which has helped the aggregate dependence upon imported
intermediate inputs and capital goods remain at roughly the same level over
the last decade. Although import substitution has played a significant role
in some sectors anid over specific time periods, its contribution to the
growth of manufacturing output has been very limited. It is estimated that
over the period 1960-68 domestic demand contributed some 60% to the growth
of manufacturing, while export expansion and import substitution contributed
respectively 38% and 2%. The emphasis given to exports of light manufactures
has resulted in a rather high degree of dependence upon imports as a source of
raw materials and intermediate inputs, as is reflected in the fact that the
domestic value added content of Korea's exports is only about 50%. While it
is clear that Korea's poor natural resource endowment limits the scope for
backward linkages, there is a real need for Korea to undertake a deepening
of its industrial structure. A shift in manufacturing towards more skill-
intensive products will also enable Korea to face competition from less
industrialized countries where unskilled labour is cheaper.  Awareness of
the desirability of deepening Korea's industrial structure was present in
the formulation of both the Second and Third Five-Year plans and lies behind
the decisions to build the first integrated steel mill and petrochemical
complex. The long-term Plan covering the decade up to 1981 which was pub-
lished by the Economic Planning Board (EPB) in 1973 emphasized the accelerated
development of the heavy and chemical industries as a critical element of
Korea's future industrialization. The recent economic setbacks have rendered
a re-examination of this long-term development plan necessary and while the
emphasis remains on developing heavy industry and on increasing the domestic
content of exported manufactures some heavy capital-and energy-intensive
projects have been deferred or altogether cancelled. As indicated earlier
the share of basic metals, shipbuilding and chemicals will be reduced from
75% to 61% of investment outlays in heavy industries while machinery, and
electronics industries will benefit from this reallocation of investment.

13.       Trends in industrial investment.  Fixed investment in the manufac-
turing sector amounted to approximately W 714 billion in 1976 which repre--
sented an increase of about 15% in nominal terms over 1975. Some 78% of
this amount was invested in the heavy industrial sector, principally basic
metals, chemicals and transport which received respectively 34%, 20% and 15%.
Investment in light industries amounted to W 154 million of which 72% was in
textile industries. About two-thirds of total manufacturing investment was
financed by foreign and domestic loans with the remainder coming from equity
investments, bond issues and internally generated funds. Over 60% of invest-
ment expenditures was for procurement of machinery and equipment. Investment
in non-manufacturing industries 1/ increased by 17% in nominal terms. Invest-
ment in power accounted for 74% of this increase. During the Fourth Five-
Year Plan period the growth rate of GNP is expected to be 9.2% per annum with
mining and manufacturing growing at 14.2% p.a. Total gross fixed investment
is projected at W 18,000 billion 2/ for the plan period with manufacturing
accounting for 24.6%
14.       Total investment outlays in the manufacturing sector for the year
1977 are projected at W 911 billion 2/. Heavy and chemical industries would
absorb 74% of the total, with basic metals, petrochemicals, machinery and
electronics accounting respectively for 21%, 15%, 12% and 5%. Light indust-
ries would absorb 26%.
15.       Government incentives.  The Korean industrial incentive policy has,
over the past ten years, been highly responsive to particular and changing
circumstances. The array of incentives has varied with Government policies
and priorities for industrial development. These policies have, with varia-
ble emphasis, included the promotion of export industries and of foreign
investment, the geographical dispersal of industry, the assistance to small
and medium industries and, more recently, the investment in heavy industries.
Incentives have included full exemption or reduction of the corporate income
tax, deferment, reduction or exemption from import duties, easy access to
financing and to special lines of credits at preferential interest rates,
accelerated depreciation and protection of import substituting industries
through tariffs.
16.       A comprehensive incentive system was established during the first
half of the 1960's which generally favored exports over import substitution.
The main elements of the incentive package included unrestricted access to
and tariff exemptions on, imports of raw materials and capital goods, generous
waste allowances in determining duty-free raw material imports, direct and
indirect tax reductions, access to subsidized credit for working capital
and fixed investment, and rate reductions on certain inputs. Key import

substituting industries received protection from imports through tariffs
and quantitative import controls. Estimates of effective subsidy rates
show, however, that export activity was generally favored over import sub-
stitution. The international competitiveness of Korean industry had sub-
stantially improved between 1970 and 1973 due to several devaluations of
the Won and the Government consequently decided to reduce export incentives.
Reductions in corporate income tax were abolished and preferential inte-
rest rates increased. In 1975, tariff exemptions on imported inputs were
abolished in favor of a system by which tariff on imported inputs is paid
at the time of importation and rebated at the time of export. Tariff
exemptions for export industries on imports of machinery and equipment were
abolished in 1974, 1/ payment of custom duties, however, can be stretched
over a three-year period.
17.       While key import substituting industries have been granted many
of the preferences given to exporters, production for domestic sale has
generally been subject to higher duties, taxes and interest charges. It has,
however, benefited from tariffs and restrictions on imports. Over the last
few years there has been a modest decline in tariff rates, 2/ and increased
reliance on import restrictions, 3/ as a means of affording protection to
domestic producers particularly in the case of capital goods. As a counter-
part for the protection afforded to domestic producers through import con-
trols, the Government has established controls over the prices charged by
these industries. 4/
18.       In the case of capital goods, exporters are no longer exempt from
import tariffs and importation of certain capital goods is restricted. Other
incentives for the purchase of domestically produced machinery include tar-
get ratios of domestically supplied capital goods in the total fixed capital
cost for a number of industries and the establishment of several specialized
medium-and long-term Government funds to provide Won financing for procurement
of domestically manufactured machinery. The largest of these funds is the
National Investment Fund (NIF) which over the Fourth Five-Year Plan period is
expected to finance nearly 18% of investment in the machinery sector and to
finance roughly 13% of the total fixed capital formation in manufacturing.
1/   Only in the case of capital goods imported under foreign capital
financing is there still complete and automatic exemption from
tariffs.
2/   The average tariff rate which has remained roughly stable between 22%
and 24% 1969 to 1972 has rapidly declined to about 12.8% in 1975.
3/   The number of prohibited items has declined from 77 in 1968 to 66 in
1975, but items subject to import restrictions have increased from
398 to 579 in 1976.
4/   In March 1976 Government enacted the Price Stabilization and Fair
Trade law.

C. The Financial Sector
19.       Institutional Set-up.  The financial sector of Korea consists of
the Bank of Korea, Deposit Money Banks, non-monetary financial institutions
and a Securities Exchange. The Bank of Korea performs regular central bank-
ing functions, including the supervision of commercial banks.
20.       Deposit Money Banks include commercial banks and specialized banks.
Commercial banks receive most of their funds through deposits from the pub-
lic. They can make all kinds of loans but have traditionally concentrated on
short-term lending; roll-over of short-term loans is common. There are five
nationwide commercial banks, ten banks with localized operations and eleven
branches of foreign banks which together had 693 branches/offices around the
country at end-1976 (all these fall under the term "commercial banks"). Four
of the five nationwide commercial banks are fully controlled by the Govern-
ment which, under Korean law, automatically receives majority rights if its
holding in a nationwide bank is 10% or more. The fifth bank is controlled
by the semi-official Korean Traders Association. All commercial banks are
subject to control and supervision by the Bank of Korea while specialized
banks are directly controlled by the Ministry of Finance.  The Specialized
Banks were all established under a Special Banking Act and are subject to
only a few specific Articles of the Bank of Korea Act and General Banking Act.
Specialized banks, as their name implies, were founded for particular pur-
poses or sectors (such as small-scale industry financing or agricultural
financing) and Government funds constitute a major source of their finan-
cial resources in addition to resources raised otherwise. Specialized Banks
include the Korea Development Bank, the Korea Exchange Bank, which was estab-
lished in 1967 mainly to relieve the Bank of Korea of commercial foreign
exchange business, the Medium Industry Bank which extends financial and tech-
nical assistance to small- and medium-scale industries, the Citizens National
Bank (mainly for mobilizing small savings and financing household loans and
small enterprises), the Korea Housing Bank, the National Agricultural Coope-
rative Federation (NACF) and the Fisheries Cooperative.
21.       Besides the above-mentioned banking institutions (the "Monetary
System") there are several non-bank finance institutions, namely trust
accounts of commercial banks, five life insurance companies, the postal
savings system, the Korean Development Finance Corporation (KDFC) which
specializes in providing medium- and long-term capital, the Korean Invest-
ment Corporation (KIC), primarily a broker for the offering and distribu-
tion of corporate securities, ten short-term finance corporations 1/ and
the Korean Capital Corporation, all of which deal in short-term money market
instruments. In addition, there were 211 mutual savings and finance com-
panies and some 1,200 authorized credit unions at end 1976. Three leasing
corporations and a merchant bank (Korea Merchant Banking Corporation) have
been established over the last few years as joint ventures between Korean
and foreign interests.
1/   Including the Korea Investment and Finance Corporation (KIFC).

22.       As o   ovember 31, 1976, total loans outstanding to the manufactur-
ing sector by all banking institutions in Korea amounted to over W 2,360
billion (US$4.9 billion equivalent), 80% of which was for operating funds,
mainly supplied by commercial banks. The largest supplier of equipment fund
loans is iDB which, as of November 31, 1976, had an outstanding portfolio of
Won 209 billion (US$430 million) or about 45% of the total outstanding medium
and long-term credit by banking institutions to industry as of that date.
23.       Capital Market.  The Korea Stock Market was moribund for many years
but showed signs of life in 1972. Before then the yields on stocks were un-
attractive as both commercial banks and the "curb market" paid high interest
rates. The market was also thin because closely held companies were reluctant
to go public. With the mid-1972 economic boom and additional financial mea-
sures, the public showed growing interest in the stock market. The curb market
was severely checked as a result of the August 1972 measures and with decreas-
ing interest rates at commercial banks, yields on stocks became attractive.
In addition, the overall investment climate became very favourable after
August 1972, and the campaign for more stock listings and for companies to
go public was intensified. The result was a large increase in stock exchange
activity in the second half of 1972 and in 1973. In 1974, trading activities
on the exchange slowed down considerably, due to the gloomy business outlook
stock listings, however, continued to rise reaching almost W 500 million at
the end of 1974. The following table summarizes the stock exchange activity
over the last six years (figures are shown as of the end of each period):

1971       50          81.9             170.2         141.4           108.7
1972       66         103.3             209.8         174.3           245.9
1973      104         200.0             305.1         251.6           426.2
1974      128         199.9             487.6         381.3           532.0
1975      189         290.7             825.0         643.4           916.0
1976      274         764.9          1,580.9       1,153.3          1,436.1
With the general improvement of the business climate and the im-
proved export prospects, trading picked up again around mid-1975 and for the
year as a whole the number of stocks listed almost doubled.
24.       In 1976, the capital market was rather sluggish in comparison to
the previous year mainly because of the Government's tight monetary policy.
The general stock price index stood at 415.3 at end-1976, an increase of 8%
only during the year, versus a 44% gain a year earlier. On the other hand,
the issuing market was very, active during the year as a result of Govern-
ment's efforts to promote the "going public" of privately held companies.
The number of listed companies increased by 85 to 274 in the year and a
total of W 263 billion was mobilized through the capital market, a 69.5% gain



ANNEX 1
Page 13
over the previous year's level. During the year, the number of shareholders
increased substantially. Over the years, the ownership structure has broad-
ened, though as at October 31, 1976, more than 68% of all shareholder still
held less than 100 shares each and accounted for only 2.05% of all shares
outstanding. The importance of the Government as a shareholder of listed
companies also decreased; while the Government (including public bodies) held
about 39% of the total number of listed stocks in 1970, its holdings had
declined to 13% by October 31, 1976. The proportion held by banking institu-
tions also declined from 15% to 9% during the same period.
25.       The rapid increase in the volume of operations on the Stock Exchange
has rendered certain improvements necessary. Among others the call market has
been replaced by a continuous auction market, investment trust companies have
been established, and the information system greatly improved. Several weak-
nesses remain, however. One of the more important problems lies in existing
laws which stipulate that new equity issues have to be at par irrespective of
the market price of stocks. These regulations are currently under review by
the Government.
26.       Interest Rates, Inflation.  The Government of Korea through the
Monetary Board determines interest rate ceilings on deposits and loans which
apply to all banking institutions. Although specialized financial institu-
tions such as KDFC or the short term finance companies are not legally bound,
in practice, they too have to follow Government policies. The development of
Korea's interest rate structure has, between 1968 and 1973, seen a continuous
reduction in both deposit and lending rates. The lowering of the rates coin-
cided, in general, with the Government's success in gradually bringing infla-
tion down until late 1973. With the emergence of the oil crisis and world-
wide inflation, Korea's price structure was particularly hard-hit because of
its high foreign trade dependence. Wholesale prices are estimated to have
increased by nearly 80% between the end of 1973 and the end of 1975. While
the Government selectively increased interest rates at the end of 1974, 1/ a
general increase of interest rates was not adopted because enterprises were
already facing severe financial strains and Government hoped to succeed in
bringing inflation under control. During the year 1976, wholesale prices are
estimated to have increased by only 9% on a year end basis and 11.2% on an
annual average basis.
27.       However, on August 2, 1976, the Government made an extensive upward
adjustment in the interest rate structure in order to contain excessive loan
demand and to better allocate funds. To stimulte domestic savings, the interest
rates on time deposits have been raised by 1.2% to a level of 16.2% p.a. for
maturities beyond one year and by 2.1% for 3 to 6 months deposits which now
1/   Raising rates on time deposits for over three months and over six
months from respectively 12% and 13.2% to 15%, and preferential rates
for loans from the NIF and IRF from 9% and 8% respectively to 12%.



ANNEX I
Page 14
yield 15% p.a. General lending rates 1/ have conversely been increased by
1.5% to 3.5% and now range between 17% and 19% p.a. depending on (i) the
financial rating of the borrower for working capital loans (with a diffe-
rential of 1% in the applicable rate); and (ii) on loan maturity for equip-
ment financing (with rates of 17% p.a. for loans maturing in less than three
years, 18% for 3 to 8 years and 19% over 8 years). Interest rates applicable
to loans from certain specialized Government funds such as NIF and IRF also
differentiate according to maturity and have been increased from 12% to 13%
for three-year loans and 14% in excess of three years.
28.       Prior to August 1976, Korean commercial banks had already resorted
to various practices which resulted in increased collateral requirements and
higher effective lending rates for their less creditworthy borrowers. Such
practices include the collection of interest in advance, 2/ the establish-
ment of compensating balances in time deposits or even the opening of install-
ment saving accounts which are used both as collateral and sinking funds.
Actual requirements vary among borrowers depending on their credit standing.
The August 1976 measures can therefore be construed as ratifying and rational-
izing a system which already differentiated between borrowers on the basis
of the risks involved. A positive element of rationalization has been intro-
duced by Korean financial authorities who have established a list of criteria
for enterprises to quality as prime borrower; this should eliminate sub-
jective judgements on a company's creditworthiness. The introduction of a
prime rate system for working capital loans and of differential rate according
to loan maturities is an important step towards improving the overall alloca-
tion of funds to industry.
1/   Unless otherwise specified, this discussion applies to the so-called
"general lending rates" as opposed to the "preferential rates" applic-
able to various priority sectors. Generally speaking, general lending
rates are applicable to loans made by KDB and Deposit Money Banks
from their own funds (essentially deposits and equity); preferential
rates apply to loans made from specialized Government funds (NIF,
IRF, etc.). At end 1976, loans at preferential interest rates accounted
for approximately 40% of the total outstanding portfolio of banking
institutions in Korea.

KDFC's Achievements in Implementing
Its Development Strategy Statement for 1976-1977
1.        KDFC, in connection with the appraisal of the fifth IBRD credit
line in 1975, had formulated a Development Strategy statement covering the
two-year period 1976-77. In this statement KDFC outlined specific activ-
ities and areas in which it proposed to exercise efforts so as to fulfill
better its developmental role. The main elements of this strategy which
were reviewed and agreed upon with IBRD are as follows:
1.   Establishment of the Korea Development Leasing Corporation
(KDLC);
2.   Establishment, jointly with the Korea Institute of Science
and Technology, of the Korea Technology Advancement
Corporation (K-TAC) in order to provide financial and
other assistance to both K-TAC and projects sponsored by
K-TAC;
3.   Assistance to the industrial machinery and machine tools
manufacturing sector in Korea;
4.   Identification and promotion of agro-industrial projects;
5.   Assistance to smaller-sized enterprises located in the less
developed areas of Korea through a scheme of cooperation
with selected Regional Commercial Banks;
6.   Promotion jointly with other foreign financial institutions
of large projects exceeding KDFC's limited financing capacity.
2.        KDFC's performance in achieving these objectives is described here-
under. A Project Promotion Office was set up within KDFC in March 1975, which
is specifically in charge of implementing KDFC's Development Strategy. This
office had, as of end January 1977, a professional staff of six persons.
3.        In view of the effective progress achieved by KDFC during the year
1976 towards implementing its Strategy statement, KDFC has revised and up-
dated this statement and formulated a new outline for its Development
Strategy covering the period 1977-78. While maintaining emphasis on the
continuation of its scheme of cooperation with the Regional Commercial Banks,
and of its assistance to K-TAC, KDFC has been including additional areas
such as intesified resource mobilization and research activities.  KDFC's
Development Strategy statement for 1977-78 appears in Annex 8.

Summary Description of the Korea Development Leasing Corporation (KDLC)
Background and Objectives
1.        Leasing is a relatively new concept in Korea.  The Korea Develop-
ment Bank established the first leasing company, Korea Industrial Leasing
Company (KILC) as a wholly-owned subsidiary in 1972, and contributed sub-
stantially to the drafting of the Law on "Promotion of the Leasing Industry"
which was enacted by the Korean Government in December 1973. In 1975 two
more leasing companies were established as joint ventures between Korean
interests holding majority participations and foreign leasing companies:
the Korea Development Leasing Company (KDLC) with a participation by Orient
Leasing Company of Japan (OLC) and Whashin Tiger Leasing Incorporated (WTL)
with the Tiger Leasing Group of the U.S. It seems unlikely that new leasing
companies will be licensed in the near future.
2.        Although still representing a minimal source of industrial financ-
ing, the leasing business has been gaining wide acceptance in Korea as is
reflected by the growth in the total assets of those leasing companies.
Leasing is encouraged by the Government as a means to alleviate the shortage
of medium- and long-term funding experienced by Korean enterprises in general,
and small- and medium-sized firms in particular. The high indebtedness of
Korean companies as reflected by their generally high debt/equity ratios
makes it difficult for these firms to raise additional term resources and
has resulted in a lack of collateral to be pledged against additional loans.
Lease financing, however, is unrelated to the lessee's capital base since
the ownership of the asset financed remains with the lessor. The lease
instrument, because of its flexibility, is particularly attractive to small-
and medium-sized enterprises which would otherwise be denied access to what
is tantamount to an unsecured loan. Furthermore, leasing can contribute sub-
stantially to the development of the domestic capital goods industry through
the leasing of domestically manufactured equipment.
3.        KDFC's efforts to supplement its own term financing functions by
developing the financial system in Korea have resulted in the establishment
of specialized subsidiaries. In 1971, KDFC established the Korea Investment
and Finance Corporation (KIFC) as a combined money market/investment banking
type financial intermediary. KDFC's interest in promoting the leasing in-
dustry in Korea was reflected by its intention, as stated in its previous
development strategy statement, to establish the Korea Development Leasing
Corporation (KDLC).

Ownership and Capitalization
4.        KDLC was incorporated in February 1975 with an authorized share
capital of W 3 billion; its paid-in share capital which currently amounts
to W 1.5 billion, will be increased by W 300 million in the second quarter
of 1977. IFC is expected to take up an equivalent of W 118 million of the
proposed increase. KDLC's domestic shareholders currently hold 55% of its
share capital including a 37% participation by KDFC. Orient Leasing Corpora-
tion of Japan (OLC) is the main foreign shareholder with 35% out of total
foreign holdings of 45%. OLC, in its capacity as one of the largest leasing
companies in the world, is taking an active part in KDLC's management and is
also providing KDLC with technical expertise and training. The following
table gives a breakdown of KDLC's ownership structure at present:

Organization and Management
5.        The Board of Directors of KDLC comprises nine members of which
five members are nominated by domestic shareholders and four by foreign
shareholders. Mr. C. H. Kim, President of KDFC is the Chairman of the
Board. The Board of Directors has delegated authority on matters of
ordinary business operations to an Executive Committee which comprises
three direcLors: the Chairman of the Board, the President and the Exe-
cutive Vice President of KDLC.
6.        KDLC's top management consists of three executive officers:  the
president, Mr. C. K. Lee, a former Senior Vice President of KDFC who was
appointed in February 1977; the Executive Vice President, Mr. Y. Ohnishi,
who is also a Director of OLC; and a Vice President, Mr. C. H. Khoo, a for-
mer manager of KDFC's Operations Department.
Operations
7.        KDLC's operations have until now been limited to writing financial
leases and issuing guarantees for leases of foreign equipment. KDLC is plan-
ning to expand its operations in the future by either providing maintenance
services directly or by associating itself with some equipment manufacturers.
8.        KDLC's activities have expanded very rapidly in 1976 from their
1975 level. Although the scale of operations remains modest, the constraint
is not one of lack of demand but rather one of shortage of funds. As of the
end of 1976, KDLC had entered into 63 contracts amounting to W 7.1 million,
as against a volume of contracts of W 0.9 billion at the end of 1974. In
addition, KDLC had extended payment guarantees for two lease contracts between
domestic firms and Orient Leasing Company amounting to US$766,000. The rapid
growth of KDLC's leasing operations was reflected in its balance sheet at the
end of 1976, with total assets reaching W 3.5 billion as against W 1.6 billion
at end of 1975 1/. Net income based on the "financing method" of accounting
shows an increase from W 1.3 million in 1975 to W 91 million in 1976. The
main highlights of KDLC's financial performance for the years 1975 and 1976
are summarized hereunder:
1/   Based on the presentation of financial statements according to the
"financing method" of accounting.

Resources
9.        The advantages inherent in the lease instrument are particularly
well suited to the Korean industrial context and prospects look promising;
but, the availability of funds has been a major constraint to the growth
of the three existing leasing companies as a more important source of in-
dustrial finance. The number of applications received by KDLC is another
indication of the considerable potential demand for leasing in Korea. The
capacity of the leasing industry to achieve its potential depends on its
success at mobilizing financial resources especially in foreign currency.
Foreign currency resources are essential in view of the present state of
development of the local machinery industry which limits the prospects for
increasing the leasing of domestically manufactured equipment. At present
approximately 16% of the equipment leased by KDLC is domestically manu-
factured, a proportion which KDLC expects to increase to 25% over the next
two years.
10.       In addition to its equity, KDLC's source of funds consisted essen-
tially of a US$5 million subloan made available by KDFC from the proceeds
of the fifth I3RD credit line. This amount has been fully committed on
<"e,ount of 26 leasing projects, the main characteristics of which appear in
Table 2 of this Appendix. Other sources of funds included a W 500 million
line of credit from KIFC and another W 500 million credit from the Cho-
Heung Bank and the Commercial Bank of Korea. For the year 1977, KDLC fore-
casts a scale of operations of about W 7.3 billion (US$15.1 million) on an
execution basis and it envisages raising resources amounting to at least
US$16.5 million. Loans of US$1 million each from Sanwa Bank and from PICA,
two foreign shareholders of KDLC are at various stages of negotiation.
KDLC is actively negotiating with IFC an equity investment of W 118 million
in its share capital and a loan of up to US$15 million. These resources
should enable KDFC to finance its projected volume of operations through
1977 and to establish its credit so as to be able to raise the additional
resources necessary to achieve its objective of a scale of operations of
W 13.5 billion (US$27.8 million) by 1981.

KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Korea Technology Advancement Corporation (K-TAC)
Background and Objectives
1.        K-TAG was incorporated in September 1974 as a fully-owned subsi-
diary of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST) 1/ with a
paid-in share cafital of W 365 million.  KIST regulations which are currently
under review have so far precluded KDFC from taking a participation in K-TAC's
equity. Although KDFC has not been lending directly to K-TAC it has extended
substantial financial assistance to projects promoted jointly with K-TAC.
Accordingly, Mr. T. Y. Hahm, Vice President of KDFC, is serving as a member
of K-TAC's Board of Directors.
2.        The objective of K-TAC's establishment is the commercialization of
KIST's research and technology developments. Specifically, K-TAC is engaged
in selling technical patents and processes developed by KIST to Korean indus-
trial enterprises. In order to ensure the satisfactory implementation of
certain new technological processes, K-TAC is also involved in the promotion
of new enterprises established specifically to apply those new technologies
on a commercial scale. Depending on its capacity to attract additional pri-
vate investment in such vetures, K-TAC may choose to establish those enter-
prises as separate legal and financial entities, or may undertake such proj-
ects on its own.
Management and Objectives
3.        K-TAC's Board of Directors comprises six members including KDFC's
representative. Mr. S. J. Hahn, President of KIST, is the Chairman of the
Board. K-TAC's top management consists of a President, Mr. Y. G. Yun, a
former head of a Research Group of KIST, and a Managing Director, who super-
vise three departments in charge of development, production and operations.
K-TAC's staff at end-1976 comprised 32 persons.
1/   KIST was established in 1966 under the auspices of the Korean Govern-
ment with outside technical assistance. KIST's present staff of 50
researchers is primarily engaged in applied research in various dis-
ciplines; its major objective is to achieve transfers of technology
to the Korean industry. KIST has also been relied upon by KDFC for
specific technical aspects of its project appraisal.



ANNEX 4
Appendix 2

Operations and Resources
4.        K-TAC's activities in 1975 were limited to the sale to private
enterprises of such technical know-how as Freon and Modacrylic Fiber
technology which had been developed by KIST. K-TAC receives know-how
fees which constitute part of its financial resources. During the year
1976, K-TAC promoted with KDFC's assistance two new projects: a bronze
powder project which is being implemented by K-TAC itself; and a cordierite
saggar project for which a new venture has been established in which both
K-TAC and KDFC have taken equity participations. Details of these two
projects are summarized below.
5.        Bronze Powder Project.  The purpose of this project is to manu-
facture high quality bronze powder for oilless bearings with an initial
production capacity of 150 M tons per year. The limited scale of operation
and the future possibility to include the production of other metal powders,
such as kelmet and brass, have led K-TAG to undertake this project on its
own. It is envisaged that after the project reaches maturity it will be spun-
off as a separate legal entity. Total project cost amounts to US$433,000 of
which US$122,000 is in foreign exchange and W 150 million in domestic cur-
rency. Financing has been arranged through K-TAC's contribution of W 100
million, and two loans from KDFC in foreign curency for US$122,000 and in
domestic currency for W 50 million. Construction of the project has been
completed and test operations of the plant are in progress. The project is
expected to go into commercial operations by the end of the first quarter
of 1977, and to generate at full capacity net foreign exchange savings of
US$0.5 million per year.
6.        Cordierite Saggar Project.  The Nam Hae Ceramics Company (NHC)
was established in March 1976 to produce cordierite saggar for mosaic tile,
with a capacity of 6,500 M tons a year. K-TAC will be the largest share-
holder with 50% of NHC's share capital amounting to W 300 million at proj-
ect completion. KDFC and a ceramic tile manufacturer will respectively
hold participations of 20% and 10% while the balance will be taken up by
private investors. In addition to its equity participation of W 60 million,
KDFC has approved a foreign currency loan amounting to US$355,000 represent-
ing the foreign exchange component of project costs which are estimated to
reach a total of US$1.85 million. Construction of the project is in pro-
gress and commercial operations are expected to start in July 1977. At
full capacity operation, it is expected that the project will generate net
foreign exchange savings of about US$1.3 million per year.
7.        Aside from these two projects, K-TAC also arranged the sale of
technical know-how developed by KIST in the production of ceramic core for
fixed carbon film resistors. KDFC provided financial assistance to the
newly established company in the form of a foreign currency loan of
US$155,000 and subscription to W 30 million convertible debentures.

KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
The Machinery Manufacturing Sector
Objectives
1.        The Government's concern for achieving a deepening of the Korean
industrial structure and for reducing its dependency on imported goods and
equipments has been reflected in the Fourth Five-Year Plan (1977-81).
The Plan proposes to increase the share of total investment allocated to
the manufacturing sector, and within this sector, allocate a higher share
of investment for machinery manufacturing. Investment allocations to the
machinery industry would increase from 10% of total manufacturing invest-
ment in the Third Plan to nearly 18% in the Fourth Plan.
2.        The Government's efforts to promote investment within the machinery
sector have so far given mixed results. Until recently, the Government had
been placing emphasis on the development of large-scale machinery plants
and had been encouraging the establishment of such firms within the Changwon
Industrial Complex. The number of plants in operation or under construction
in this industrial complex lags far behind the Government's original ex-
pectations. The Government consequently realized that a more diversified set
of promotional measures was needed to develop the machinery sector and con-
sequently took new measures which include in particular: (i) the provision
of medium term credit in domestic currency, out of the proceeds of the
National Investment Fund (NIF), for purchase of domestically produced capital
goods; (ii) the designation by the Ministry of Commerce and Industries (MCI)
of a number of medium- and small-scale manufacturers of machinery components
and parts which are to receive special financial assistance; and (iii) the
encouragement of technology transfer through the establishment of specialized
technological research institutions.
3.        By pledging in its Development Strategy statement to assist in
the development of the domestic machinery sector as early as 1975, KDFC
appears as a forerunner of the newly formulated Government policy outlined
above.
Achievements
4.        KDFC's experience in financing projects in the machinery sector
has proved that, in view of its limited financial resources, it could
not get involved in the financing of such large projects as those located



ANNEX 4
Appendix 3
Page 2
within the                        G oonprde   "al Corpl '.el-2Ire is little scope for KDFC to
be influential in modifyi-ng project design to its satisfaction were it to
take a minority stake in such projects. KDFC consequently decided to direct
its financial assistance towqard smali- and medium-scale machine shops which
often have accumulated substantial technical know-how.  In view of the favor-
able market prospects in Korea, KD'FC also forsees real growth potential in
the manufacLuiring of agricultural equipment.
5.        Financijlgof              F .4ro-Jcts.  Loan amiounts approved for machinery
projects increased from 57,   KDFC's rotal approvals in 1975 to nearly 7% in
1976. A total of 7 projects- were approved for the period 1975-1976 in an
amount of approximately U7''f., million.  KDFC has already contacted several
of the 52 medium- and s-Lal.-scale prcducers of machinery components and parts
identified by MCI for whic.' the Governmeoit is considering special financial.
assistance and various fiscal incentives. It is expected that the number of
firms eligible for preferenti'al assistance by the Government will be increased
to 500 by 1981.
6.        Financing of Locail:  Prooured Machinery.  Aside from its direct
financial assistance to  -cKL aer> macutracturers, KDFC has also been helping
the local machinery manufacturlng industry indirectly by providing financial
assistance in domestic currency to its borrowers for procurement of domestic-
ally manufactured equipmenri   It had alsso been agreed with KDFC that the pro-
ceeds of loan 1145-KO could be utilized to finance an agreed percentage
(assumed to represent the share of imported materials and components) of the
cost of domestically procured capital goods.  The percentage of 60% was agreed
upon on the basis of evidence subm-Itted by 1DFC.  Table 1 attached to this
Appendix gives a list of 15 projects for wvhich KDFC has been utilizing this
facility.  A total of US$3.6 ,r.'. ion was utilized which represents approxi-
mately 6.5% of the total loan amount.
7.        Technology_ran_sfer.   IDFCs privileged relations with Korea
Institute of Technology have led to the establishment of the Korea Technology
Advancement Corporation (K-TAC) which is specifically in charge of promoting
technology transfers to the Korean industries. A description of KDFC's
involvement with K-TAC is provided in Appendix 2. In addition, KDFC is cur-
rently considering the establishment ot an engineering consulting office.
DEG, a foreign shareholder of KDFC has indicated that it would be willing
to partially finance the cost of a foreign engineer, assigned for a period
of several months to a year within KDFC, to start such an office. KDFC would
provide additional funding as well as staffing and office space within its
premises. Depending on its success, such an office could ultimately become
a separate entity.  Establishment of s5uch an office would serve two main pur-
poses.  Firstly, it would enable KDFC to benefit from its technical know-

machinery manufacturing industry in Korea and, in this respect, has received
substantial assistance from KDFC. A definite formulation of the project has
yet to be reached but there is a possibility that KDFC be used as a channel
of funds for the Korean machinery sector.

Agro-Industrial Projects
1.        Background.  In recent years the Korean Government has been placing
heavier emphasis on the promotion of agro-processing industries as an effec-
tive means of reducing the disparity between urban and rural incomes. The
development of industries processing agricultural raw materials can encourage
crop diversification and integrate farm production into the commercial sector.
A specialized Government agency, the Agriculture and Fishery Development Cor-
poration (AFDC), has been since 1967 extending limited financial assistance in
the form of equity participation and term finance to the agro-processing sector.
KDFC, whose financing of this type of activity has been minimal in the past,
feels that the prospects for growth in the agro-industrial sector are quite
promising and that it can complement AFDC's action in this sector. KDFC con-
sequently designed its development strategy statement to reflect the inten-
tion to increase its support to agro-processing industries.
2.        Achievements.  In view of its relative inexperience in this type
of operations KDFC's involvement with the agro-processing sector has been
cautious and limited to two types of activity: viticulture and dairy pro-
duction. In these two fields, however, KDFC has been showing quite an inno-
vative approach.
3.        Viticulture.  KDFC carried out a feasibility study on viticulture
which concluded that there is a potential for grape cultivation for wine
production. On the basis of this study, KDFC has identified and promoted
two viticulture projects jointly with the Oriental Brewery (OB) Group and the
Hai Tai Group. These projects are still in an experimental stage; the ul-
timate objective is the utilization of idle slope land and the substitution
of grain liquors with grape alcohol. The two projects consist of the estab-
lishment of vineyards over a total area of 190 ha and in both cases provide
for the development of two nurseries of 10 ha each which will produce vine
stocks for distribution to contracting farmers. The total cost of these two
projects is approximately US$3.1 million of which KDFC is financing approxi-
mately US$1 million essentially in the form of equity participations and
loans in domestic currency.
4.        Dairy Production Projects.  As a means of increasing rural income
the Government has been placing emphasis on projects which can both increase
rural employment during the off-season and can help put idle land, essentially
slope lands, to productive use. On-farm rearing of dairy cattle qualifies
under this criteria and, with adequate marketing channels, milk can be pro-
cessed into dairy products. Two dairy projects representing a fairly in-
novative approach are now at various stages of realization. In both cases



ANNEX 4
Appendix 4
Page 2
a manufacturer of dairy products imports several hundred heads of dairy
cows and distributes up to 5 or 6 heads to selected farmers. Eligible far-
mers should possess some idle wooded land which can be used as pasture land.
Under the terms of the contract the farmer is given a six year loan 1/ by the
dairy manufacturer to whom he undertakes to supply his whole production of
raw milk. Ownership of the cattle heads is transferred after full repayment
of the loan. Technical assistance such as nutritional advice and veterinary
services is provided by the dairy producer. KDFC's Board of Directors has
already approved a foreign currency loan of US$367,000 to a first project for
financing the importation of 324 heads of cattle to be distributed to 66 par-
ticipating farmers.

KDFC's Scheme of Cooperation with Regional Commercial Banks (RCBs)
1.        Of the specific areas listed in its Development Strategy statement
for the period 1976-77, the proposed scheme of cooperation with selected
Regional Commercial Banks (RCBs) certainly appears to be the most innovative
and promising area.
Background and Objectives
2.        While its longer-term objectives may still include the setting up
of one or several regional offices, KDFC felt it could have an immediate
effect on improving the overall geographical and clientele dispersal of its
operations by establishing privileged links with certain Regional Commercial
Banks (RCBs). KDFC also felt that such a scheme of cooperation would improve
its impact on the small scale enterprises located in backward areas. KDFC
began consulting with several RCBs in mid-1975. Between August 1975 and
December 1976 arrangements were contracted with four out of the ten Regional
Commercial Banks existing in Korea. Summary data on the RCBs collaborating
with KDFC is shown in Table 1.
3.        Basically, the objective of this collaboration agreement is for
KDFC to provide the foreign currency requirements of projects identified and
appraised by the RCBs along guidelines issued to them by KDFC. The RCBs
themselves finance the domestic currency requirements and assume the general
supervision and follow-up of these projects. KDFC has been impressing on
the RCBs' management the desirability of improving the appraisal and supervi-
sion capability of their staff. To achieve that objective, KDFC has provided,
and will continue to provide, substantial training to the staff of the RCBs.
4.        At the outset, KDFC earmarked and allocated to the participating
RCBs an amount of US$5 million out of the fifth IBRD credit line. This
amount was totally committed by KDFC on account of 18 projects (particulars
of which appear in Table 2 of this Appendix), over a period of approximately
one year. In order to cover the additional foreign currency requirements of
this scheme through the first half of 1977, KDFC has earmarked an amount of
US$8 million out of the second ADB credit line of US$40 million.
Nature and Scope of Collaboration
5.        KDFC has issued guidelines for collaborating RCBs which essentially
define: (i) the type of industries eligible for financing under the agree-
ment; (ii) the financial tests under which the proposed company should



ANNEX 4
Appendix 5
Page 2
qualify; (iii) the type of equipments eligible for financing; and (iv) the
general terms and conditions of KDFC's foreign currency loans. These guide-
lines emphasize in particular the need to give high priority to export and
import substituting industries and the desirability of promoting the creation
of new, and modernization of existing, small enterprises. In this respect,
no limit is set on the assets size of the project sponsor, nor on maximum
employment, KDFC however has established a limit of US$500,000 as the normal
upper limit of foreign currency loans to any single enterprise. Working
procedures have been laid out by KDFC which delineate the respective respon-
sibilities of the RCBs and of KDFC. The RCBs, after selection of a prospec-
tive borrower, are required to submit summarized information on the proposed
project to KDFC. After approval of the project, in principle, KDFC issues
guidelines on the various aspects to be covered in the appraisal report,
responsibility of which rests with the RCBs. The findings of the appraisal
staff are summarized in a standard appraisal form submitted to KDFC. After
reviewing the appraisal report KDFC notifies the RCB of its decision to
approve or reject a loan. A loan agreement must then be contracted between
KDFC and the borrower. The Regional Bank to whom most of the fixed assets
of the borrower have usually been pledged in guarantee for earlier loans
(and which does not wish to share its mortgage rights with other banks such
as KDFC) extends to KDFC a full payment guarantee. The RCB is responsible
for project supervision which includes regular reporting on project construc-
tion and completion, follow-up assistance, and collection of principle and
interests on due date. The same procedures are used for procurement and
disbursement as in KDFC's other projects. The collaboration agreement with
the RCBs stipulates that a commission currently fixed at 0.5% per annum
of the amounts outstanding will be payable by KDFC to the Regional Bank for
its mediation and supervision services.
Participating RCBs
6.        Because of their receptiveness to the proposed collaboration scheme
and their location in the southern part of Korea (which is a relatively less
developed area), two Regional Commercial Banks were originally selected in
1975: The Taegu Bank and the Chunbuk Bank. Due to its location in a princi-
pally rural area, the Chunbuk Bank had, by the end of 1975, been unable to
identify any potential project for financing. KDFC consequently decided to
enter into a business agreement with the Bank of Pusan in March 1976, in spite
of the much more advanced character of this area and asked the Bank of Pusan
to place primary emphasis on assistance to small-scale industries. Lending
out of the US$5 million allocation was therefore limited to projects promoted
by the Bank of Taegu and Bank of Pusan. In December 1976 with the second
ADB line of credit being made available to KDFC, a fourth Regional Bank, the
Kwangju Bank entered into an agreement with KDFC.
7.        In view of the lagging demand for investment experienced by the
Chunbuk Bank, KDFC decided to sponsor jointly with the Asiatic Research
Center of Korea University, a study of the current economic position and



ANNEX 4
Appendix 5
Page 3
development prospects of the Chunbuk Province. KDFC, which will finance part
of the costs involved in carrying out this survey scheduled for completion
by late 1977, has included in the terms of reference the identification of
prospective industrial projects which could ultimately be financed jointly
by KDFC and the Chunbuk Bank.
8.        Although the willingness of the RCBs to accept KDFC's procedures
and requirements, as well as the limited foreign currency resources available
to KDFC for promotion of such projects, does constrain the scope for an expan-
sion of the scheme of collaboration to the other RCBs, KDFC intends to place
priority on the assistance to smaller commercial banks such as the Chunbuk
and Kwangju Banks which are located in less developed areas.
Financing
9.        Experience has shown that small scale enterprises in provincial
areas have not had, so far, an easy access to foreign currency resources
although the Medium Industry Bank has been active in this type of business.
The demand for foreign currency funds by the RCBs could actually have largely
exceeded the limited resources tentatively allocated by KDFC. In addition to
the US$5 million from the fifth IBRD line of credit, KDFC has allocated US$8
million out of the second ADB line of credit. At end January 1977, an amount
of US$4 million had already been earmarked out of the second allocation on
account of 12 projects which had been identified and were being appraised by
the RCBs. KDFC also intends to utilize part of the proceeds of the proposed
sixth Bank loan to pursue its collaboration with the RCBs.
Training
10.       KDFC has been active in providing training assistance to the staff
of the participating RCBs. Particular areas in which KDFC's training has been
emphasized relate to project identification, appraisal, and follow-up. In
addition to occasional field visits by KDFC's staff in which extensive discus-
sions of appraisal techniques are carried out with the appraisal staff of the
RCBs, KDFC has also been arranging, during the year 1976, formal one-week
training sessions in Seoul for four staff members of the Taegu, Pusan and
Kwangju Banks. The novelty of such appraisal techniques for the RCBs' loan
officers makes it necessary for KDFC to provide continuous training for an
extended period of time. Consequently, KDFC intends to organize, in 1977, a
training session which will accommodate 15 persons including representatives
of the projects financed, as well as some RCB officials.
Characteristics of Projects Financed under the RCB Collaboration Agreement
11.       The main characteristics of the 18 projects financed for a total of
US$5.1 million out of the fifth IBRD line of credit are summarized in Tables
2 and 3. KDFC's financing under the RCB scheme accounts respectively for 27%



ANNEX 4
Appendix 5
Page 4
by number an.i 8% by amount of its total loan approvals during the year 1976.
Loans ranged trom US$130,000 to US$525,000 with an average of US$280,000 which
is nearly 3.5 times smaller than the overall average of US$966,000 for KDFC's
lending in 1976.
12.       Table 4 attached to this Appendix gives the partial economic indi-
cators of projects financed under the RCB scheme. This data clearly shows
that KDFC's lending went to much smaller projects than in its other opera-
tions. The average investment cost for projects financed by the RCB amounted
to US$655,000 as against a US$2.9 million average for all loan approvals by
KDFC in 1976. The average investment cost per job created can be estimated
at US$8,400 as against a US$33,700 overall average, a clear indication that
the RCB projects are much more conducive to labor employment than KDFC's usual
operations. It is also worth pointing out that in spite of this smaller size
the contribution of these projects to Korean exports is not negligible as
reflected in the share of exports to total sales 1/ which averages 72% for
projects financed under this scheme as against 57% for all KDFC financed
projects.
13.       Table 3 shows the summarized characteristics of the 18 loans
approved and of the sponsoring firms. The distribution of sponsoring firms
in terms of assets size, sales volume and employment shows that they belong
to the small- and medium-size sector, at least in relation to KDFC's normal
lending operations. The distribution of loans approved by purpose shows the
high incidence of new projects which accounted for 42% of the amounts loaned
as against 22% only for KDFC's overall operations in 1976. With 10 out of the
total 18 projects promoted by the Taegu Bank which is located in a major tex-
tile region, it is hardly surprising that the textile and wearing apparel sector
accounts for nearly 70% of the total amounts loaned under the RCB scheme.
Since a heavy concentration within one sector may prove a cause for concern,
KDFC has been impressing on participating banks the need to diversify their
portfolio and the Taegu Bank has agreed to do its best to identify potential
projects in other sectors to the extent possible.

ANNEX 5
KOREA
KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
KDFC's Influence in Improving Project Design
1.      Annex 12 of the appraisal report of Loan 1145-KO to KDFC presented
a selection of 10 cases for the period 1968-1974, in which some modifications
in project design suggested by KDFC were actually implemented by the projects
sponsors. A selection of 14 new cases covering the period 1975-1976 is
appended to this annex.
2.      In about half of the examples listed hereunder recommendations by
KDFC aimed at strenghtening the financial structure of the proposed project
by requiring from project sponsors that they increase their equity contributions.
Such a requirement represents on KDFC's part a legitimate attempt to better
allocate its scarce resources and to indirectly help mobilize domestic savings.
Commercial lenders too, occasionally require higher equity financing of project
costs which effectively reduces the risks of default. As a development oriented
financial institution, however, KDFC attaches more weight to project merits
than to the solidity of collateral. Ascertaining that a project is viable and,
if desirable, improving its conception is for KDFC the best guarantee that the
borrower will be able to repay its loan.
3.      Accordingly KDFC makes full use of the professional experience of its
appraisal staff to advise borrowers on possible ways to improve the design
of their project. Aside from financial restructuring and co-financing
operations, KDFC's advisory functions relate to three principal areas: (a) tech-
nical design, choice of technology and selection of machinery; (b) market prospects
and related production capacity; and (c) organizational and legal set-up of
the proposed projects. The economic benefits of the projects such as their
contribution to the deepening of the industrial structure and to employment
creation also rank high among KDFC's concerns and have in some instances led
to the addition of certain productions, better capacity utilization or procure-
ment of locally manufactured equipment rather than import.

KOREA
KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
KDFC's Influence in Improving Project Design: a Selection of Cases
1. Korea Ferrite Corporation
A.   The Original Project
The original local currency cost of the project was to be financed by
W170 million in equity, W59.2 million in bank loans and a W55 million loan from
the shareholders.
B.   KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC suggested that the share capital be increased to W205 million, and
the shareholders' loan reduced to W20 million.
C.   Reasons for Modification
There was a need to strengthen the applicant's equity position and
financial structure.
2. Chun Ri Shipping Co., Ltd.
A.   The Original Project
The original project was the purchase of a bulk carrier of about 10,000 DWT
operated for grain transportation on the Korea/U.S.A. route. The vessel
acouisition cost was to be financed by a loan from KDFC and a share capital
increase of W200 million.
B.   KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC recommended that the applicant purchase a log carrier instead of
a bulk carrier, and increase its share capital by W505 million.
C.   Reasons for Modification
KDFC believed that the applicant lacked the necessary experience for
operating a bulk carrier, and that the applicant's financing capacity was too
limited to allow acquisition of a bulk carrier.
The share capital increase of W505 million was considered necessary to
strengthen the applicant's equity position and to improve a debt-heav'T firancial
structure.

3.  ,orea Technology Advancement Corporation
A.   The Original Project
The initial proposal called for a new bronze powder manufacturing plant
with an annual production capacity of 150 metric tons, to be developed as a
separate division within K-TAC's organization.
B.   KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC suggested that within two c.r tlree years following the start of operations
the plant be separated from K-TAC as an independent legal entity.
C.   Reasons for Modification
(1) It seems desirable that the project eventually become a separate
legal entity so that K-TAC can pursue its own objectives.
(2) It is expected that the project will take two or three years to reach
the optimum scale of operation.
(3) This is in line with the general objective of broadening the owner-
ship of Korean industries.
4. _am Ryoung Trading Co., Ltd.
A.  The Original Project
The initial proposal called for the installation of 10 sets of embroidery
machines for the establishment of a new embroidery plant.
B.   KDFC's Suggested Modificaticn
KDFC suggested that the number of sets of embroidery machines be reduced
to 6.
C.   Reasons for Modification
(1) At the outset, the applicant, a newly organized company, should
alleviate the risks involved in marketing a relatively large product
in the overseas market.
(2)  The cost of the original project seemed beyond the company's
financing capacity.

5. Y. H. Shipping Co., Ltd.
A.   The Original Project
The original project was to purchase a bulk carrier of about 16,000 DWT
to be operated on the Korea/Middle East route.
B.   KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC recommended that the applicant change the vessel type from a bulk
carrier to a log carrier for operation on the Korea/Southeast Asia route.
C.   Reasons for Modification
KDFC thought it would be more desirable for the applicant to acquire
another log carrier to supplement and strengthen its current log shipping
services, on the Korea/Southeast Asia route. KDFC believed that the applicant
lacked sufficient experience to start operating a bulk carrier on the Middle
East route.
6. Korea Zinc Co., Ltd.
A.   The Original Project
The initial proposal called for the establishment of a new zinc refinery
with an annual production capacity of 80,000 M/T of electrolytically refined
zinc ignot of special high grade, with financing from both KDFC and commercial
sources.
B.   KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC suggested that the applicant scale down the annual production capacity
from 80,000 M/T to about 50,000 M/T and recommended joint financing between
KDFC and IPC.
C.   Reasons for Modification
(1) To reduce the risks involved in marketing a larger production in
the overseas market.
(2) To provide more favorable long-term financing under a KDFC/IFC
joint financing arrangement.

7. Joong Ang Shipping Co., Ltd
A. The Original Project
The original project was to purchase a ten-year-old bulk carrier.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC advised the applicant to purchase a newer carrier.
C. Reason for Modification
KDFC believed that the originally projected ten-year-old vessel was too
old to be operated efficiently.
8. International Steamship Corporation
A. The Original Project
The local currency cost of the project was to be financed by W200 million
in equity and W222 million from other banks.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC suggested that the share capital be increased by W300 million and
that the bank loan be reduced to W122 million.
C. Reason for Modification
There was a need to strengthen the applicant's equity base to improve its
financial structure.
9. Andrew Trade Corporation
A. The Original Project
The applicant, as a sole proprietorship, proposed the expansion of its
plastic molding capacity through the installation of 11 sets of injection
molding machines.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC suggested that the company be converted into a joint stock company.
C. Reasons for Modification
(1)   Broadening of the company's ownership.
(2)   A lower income tax rate is applied to joint stock companies, as com-
pared with the rate applied to sole proprietorships.

10. Nam Yang Dairy Products Co., Ltd.
A. The Original Project
The applicant planned to distribute 324 head of pregnant dairy heifers
to over 60 dairy farmers. The ownership title of the cattle would have
been transferred to the participating farms after repayment of a three-
year credit.
B . KDFC's Suggested Modifications
KDFC suggested that the applicant not transfer the ownership title until
full repayment of the proposed KDFC loan, and extend the credit term to farmers
to six years, including a two-year grace period which is in line with KDFC's
own terms.
C. Reasons for Modification
(1) KDFC desired that the ownership title of the proposed heifers
be held by the applicant until the KDFC loan has been fully
repaid.
(2)  KDFC intended to reduce the repayment burden of the participating
farmers by extending the credit term to six years.
11. Kony Precision Company, Ltd.
A. The Original Project
The initial proposal was to establish a new quartz crystal manufacturing
plant with an annual production capacity of 10 million units, at an estimated
total cost of US$750 thousand in foreign exchange and W100 million in local
currency. KDFC was requested to finance the full foreign exchange cost, with
the local currency cost to be provided by share capital.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modifications
KDFC recommended that the annual production capacity be reduced to 6.2
million units, and also proposed that the share capital be increased to
W120 million from the initial WIOO million.
C. Reasons for Modification
(1) The annual capacity of 10 million units was considered to involve
a high risk in marketing for a start-up company, considering the
capacity of the existing companies.
(2) KDFC's estimate of local currency requirement for the project was
greater than the applicant's estimate, thus it was desirable to in-
crease equity contribution by the applicant for successful implementa-
tion of the project.
The modifications resulted in a reduction of the foreign exchange cost to
US$500 thousand which was fully financed by KDFC.

12.  Yun Ilan Manufacturing Co., Ltd.
A. The Original Project
The proposed project was to establish a new assembly line to manufacture
automatic bottling machinery and to expand the applicant's existing chemical
plant manufacturing facilities. The applicant's original proposal was to
implement the above project in two stages. The project cost was estimated at
US$800,000 in foreign exchange and W1,091 million in local currency for its
first stage project, and US$500,000 and W45 million for its second stage
project. The two projects were to be implemented in 1976 and 1978, re-
spectively. KDFC was requested to finance the foreign exchange cost of
US$800,000 and WIOO million for the first stage project.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC suggested that the applicant combine the first and second stage
projects, purchasing additional second-stage equipment amounting to about
US$400,000.
C. Reasons for Modification
(1)  KDFC believed that the applicant's implementation plans could be
accelerated.
(2)  The addition of the second stage items will enable the applicant
to diversity its production.
(3)  Construction of the new plant to accommodate the second stage equip-
ment was under way, and KDFC believed that combining the two
projects would accomplish cost savings in project implementation.
13. Dong Yang Textile Manufacturing Co., Ltd.
A. The Original Project
The local currency cost of the project was to be financed by a commercial
loan of W150 million and W197 million from funds generated by operations.
B. KDFC's Suggested Modification
KDFC suggested that the share capital be increased by W100 million to
W500 million, and that the bank loan be reduced to W50 million.
C. Reason for Modification
KDFC believed that financing through share capital increase would help the
company strengthen its equity position and improve its financial structure.

KOREA
KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Summary Description of Korea Investment and Finance Corporation
1.        Background and objectives.  Because of the conditions prevailing
in the Korean financial environment prior to KIFC's establishment in 1971,
the short-term financial needs of local industry were, to a large extent,
satisfied by the unorganized money market or "curb market," where interest
rates of up to 6.5% per month were common. A study of the financial sector
in which KDFC participated concluded that such funding needs could be
satisfied by a new class of institutions dealing in short-term credit
instruments of all kinds, underwriting and distribution of corporate
securities. Consequently, KIFC was established in 1971 under the sponsor-
ship of KDFC and IFC as a combined money market/investment banking type
financial intermediary. KIFC became the first institution to operate under
the Short-Term Financing Business Law which was enacted in September 1972.
Subsequently, nine other short-term financing companies were established
in 1973 and 1974. The ten companies had, as of December 31, 1976 a portfolio
of discounted notes outstanding amounting to W430.4 billion.
2.        Ownership and management.  KIFC's paid-in capital was increased
to W3 billion in 1976; 62% is owned by domestic shareholders, and 38% by
foreign shareholders. IFC and KDFC own 20% each. Mr. C.H. Kim, President
of KDFC has been Chairman of the Board since KIFC's inception while Mr. B.J.
Lee, a former Senior Vice President of KDFC was appointed President of KIFC
in August 1973.
3.        Operations.  The growth of KIFC's operations has been very rapid.
KIFC's discounted notes outstanding at the end of 1976 amounted to W56.3
billion, an 82% increase over year end 1975. Outstanding notes sold
totalled W53.2 billion of which 75% was KIFC paper. In 1976, KIFC managed
underwritings of three share issues amounting to W716 million which were-
heavily over-subscribed, on the other hand, the greater part of the three
bond underwritings managed during the year for W2.1 billion had to be taken
up by the company.
4.        Performance.  In general, KIFC's growth and performance have been
very satisfactory. The company's total assets increased by 80% in 1976 to
W45.6 billion as against W25.4 billion at end 1975. Profitability expressed
in terms of net income after tax as percentage of average equity remained
at approximately 31% in 1976 in spite of a Wl billion share capital increase
during the year.

KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Outline of Development Strategy for 1977-1978
A.   Background
In July 1975, KDFC adopted, in consultation with the World Bank, a
Statement of Development Strategy for 1976-1977 outlining some specific
developmental objectives and activities, apart from its normal financing
activity. Many elements contained in the statement have since been im-
plemented, including:
(a) the establiuhment in 1975, jointly with the Korea Institute of Science
and Technology (KIST) of the Korea Technology Advancement CorDoration
(K-TAC) which has now entered the operating staRe.
(b) the creation in March 1975 of a Promotion Unit within KDFC's organiza-
tion;
(c) co-financing of small enterprises in conjunction with the Regional
Commercial Banks;
(d) financial assistance to agro-industry;
(e) financial assistance to, and promotional inputs into, a number of
projects in the machinery industry sector (see also para III (B) );
(f) promotion, jointly with IFC and joint financing arrangements amount-
ing to $67.6 million, in setting up the electrolytic zinc refinery
project in 1976;
(g) the acquisition with IFC's assistance, of KDFC's first foreign
commercial loan of about $20 million in April 1976.
B.   New Objectives
It is KDFC's intention to consolidate its past developmental achievements
including those noted above, as well as to further enhance its development
impact. During the two-year period 1977-1978, KDFC expects to provide term
finance to industry amounting to $147 million in foreign exchange and W7.9
billion in domestic currency. In parallel with the continuing expansion of
its financing, KDFC will in the same two-year period focus on the development
objectives outlined below.
I.   Project Promotion and Resource Allocation
(a) KDFC plans to establish, in collaboration with the German Development
Corporation (DEG), an engineering consulting office within KDFC's
organization, whose object will be to identify and promote feasible
machinery projects (this office may be spun off subsequently as a
separate company);
(b) Continuation and expansion of KDFC's program of cooperation with the
Regional Commercial Banks for financing small-scale enterprises,
especially in backward areas. In this context, greater efforts will
be made by KDFC to help these banks improve their capability for project
appraisal and follow-up work;



ANNEX 8
Page 2
(c) Continuation of assistance to K-TAC (which to date has developed two
projects) 1/ with a view to advancing and exploiting commercially,
additional domestic technological inventions and discoveries;
(d) Intensification of KDFC's efforts at improving resource allocation
through promotional inputs and the introduction of appropriate changes
in the design of projects financed by KDFC.
II. Resource Mobilization
(a) KDFC will attempt to raise additional private funds, both foreign and
domestic, in order to gradually reduce its dependence on its traditional
(and official) sources of funds (IBRD, ADB, et al). KDFC's objective
would be to reduce the proportion of official funding (from IBRD, ADB,
et al) to around 2/3 of its overall resources by 1981.
(b)  On the foreign currency side, KDFC will intensify its efforts (which
already came to fruition in April 1975 with the acquisition of the
foreign commercial loan refered to in paragraph A(g) ) at mobilizing
private commercial funds, primarily through its foreign shareholders
and IFC, with a view to gradually reducing its dependence on its
traditional sources of funds (IBRD, ADB, et al). Specifically, KDFC
will endeavor to raise another foreign commercial loan of up to $30
million during 1977-78;
(c) On the domestic currency side, KDFC will sustain its resource mobilization
efforts through additional share issues (the next one for W3 billion is
contemplated for 1978), and will consider issuing medium-term bonds,
perhaps in 1979;
(d) At the project level, KDFC will expand its efforts at arranging joint
financing with both foreign and local institutions, for large projects.
III. Research
(a)  KDFC will strengthen its research capability and activity.  One specific
study to be undertaken by KDFC Jointly with the Asian Research Center
(of the Korea University) relates to Chunbuk province, a backward area,
with a view to identifying and promoting projects suitable for development
in that area. This survey is scheduled for completion in late 1977.
(b) KDFC cooperates and will continue to cooperate, with IFC in a current
study for developing a framework for financing Korea's machinery industry.
(This represents a joint undertaking by IFC, KDFC and the Korean Eximbank).
1/   these projects are a bronze powder project and a cordierite
saggar project.

ANNEX 12
KOREA
KOREA DEVELOPMENT FINANCE CORPORATION
Statement of Operational Policies
(Approved at the Board of Directors' Meeting on April 25, 1967.
Amended at the Board of Directors' Meetings on February 29, 1968;
February 26, 1973; February 26, 1974; December 17, 1974; June 19,
1975; and July 23, 1976.)
The Korea Development Finance Corporation, whose object is to promote
the expansion of private enterprise in the Republic of Korea, will be guided
by the policies set forth below:
I. The Scope of Investment Activities
1) KDFC will invest only in productive enterprises. While its primary
activity will be manufacturing and processing industry, it may invest
also in other types of enterprises, including transport, tourism,
and large-scale commercially-oriented agriculture. However, trade,
real estate and small-scale agriculture will be excluded.
2) KDFC will finance only private enterprises which are properly organized
and managed. KDFC will not invest in undertakings which are Government-
owned and operated, but a Government holding of not more than 15% of the
voting stock of a private enterprise shall not make such enterprise
ineligible for financial assistance from KDFC. KDFC will finance
both new enterprises and existing ones for expansion or improvemennt.
3) In its operations, KDFC will give due regard to the Government's
general economic plans and policies. The following categories of
industries will receive high priority, in accordance with the Government
economic policies and objectives:
a) export industries;
b) import-substitute industries;
c) industries producing raw materials necessary for production of
export commodities and import-substitutes;
d) indigenous local industries which have special advantage in
comparative costs and potential marketability in foreign
markets;
e) participation or assistance in the turn-over of the government-
owned industries to private ownership.



ANNEX 12
Page 2
4) KDFC will assist private enterprises in the following ways:
a) medium and long-term loans;
b) equity participation (through underwriting, conversion rights,
direct participation in share capital or otherwise);
c) guarantee of payment for machinery and equipment imported
or otherwise;
d) guarantee and underwriting of corporate securities;
e) technical and managerial consultant services; and
f) any other appropriate manner.
5) KDFC will seek through its operation to broaden the ownership of
private securities in Korea.
6) KDFC's financial assistance will be primarily for expenditures for
fixed assets. KDFC will, however, consider requests for permanent
working capital in conjunction with its financial assistance for
such capital expenditures.
7) KDFC will study periodically the trend of over-all industrial development
and investment opportunities in the private sector in cooperation with
research institutes for promotion of new enterprises or expansion of
the existing ones.
II. Basis for Investment Decisions
8) KDFC will make investment decisions only on the basis of sound
investment criteria and standards, and will provide financial
assistance only to those projects which are financially and
economically sound and technically feasible. Special attention
will be given to the ability of management and the profitability of
the enterprise.
III. Diversification of Portfolio
9) KDFC will diversify its portfolio in order to maintain a reasonable
level of risk.
10) KDFC will not provide financial assistance of less than the Won
equivalent of $50,000. The maximum financial commitment in whatever
form, including loan, share capital or guarantee or any combination
thereof, that KDFC may make to any single enterprise will not normally
exceed 25% of the total of KDFC's paid-in capital and free reserves.



ANNEX 12
Page 3
11) KDFC will not commit to any single enterprise in form of share capital
more than 10% of KDFC's paid-in capital and free reserves. The
aggregate equity investment of KDFC at any time will not exceed the
total of its paid-in share capital and free reserves.
12) In undertaking large-size projects, KDFC will seek cooperation with
other financial institutions, both domestic and foreign.
IV. Turn-over of Portfolio
13) In order to recover its resources for new commitments and to encourage
widespread ownership of private securities, KDFC will revolve its
portfolio whenever it can do so on satisfactory terms. In selling
an investment it will pay due regard not only to its own interests
but also to the interests of other participants in such investment,
as also to the interest of the concern whose shares are involved.
V. Relationship with Enterprises Financed
14) KDFC will not take a controlling interest in any enterprise in which
it has invested, or any other interest which would give it primary
responsibility for management, except that in the case of jeopardy,
it may take such action as may be necessary to protect its interest.
To this end it will not take up more than 25% of the share capital
of an enterprise, except as the result of an underwriting commitment
undertaken in the expectation that the investment would in fact be
within the limit cited.
15) In accordance with normal banking practice, KDFC will require its
borrowers to provide and to maintain adequate security, to keep
records and accounts in accordance with sound accounting practices,
and to furnish whatever information on their operations and accounts
KDFC deems desirable. KDFC will take the right to inspect the
enterprises it finances as well as their operations and accounts.
16) Business secrets and other information furnished by applicants or
clients will be treated as confidential.
VI. Financial Guidelines
17) KDFC will lend and invest its resources in such a way as to maintain
the value of its capital. KDFC will pass to its clients any foreign
exchange risk it assumes or find other suitable means to cover it.
18) KDFC will not incur any debt in excess of eight and a half times
the aggregate of its paid-in capital and free reserves.



ANNEX 12
Page 4
19) KDFC will maintain accounting records adequate to reflect its
business operations in accordance with sound and generally accepted
international accounting practices and standards. KDFC will employ
qualified and independent public accountants to audit its books and
cerfity the accounts annually.
VII. Profits and Their Distribution
20) KDFC will seek to develop earnings sufficient to cover expenses and
taxes, to provide reserves adequate to the size and risks of its
portfolio and to protect its equity against erosion and to pay
satisfactory dividends. It will seek profits on its equity
investments and will impose interest rates, fees and other charges
for its loans and services which will permit it to achieve that
level of profitability. It will build and maintain reserves consistent
with sound financial management. It will set aside each year from
net income before tax the amount required by law as the legal reserve.
In addition, it will accumulate other reserves, including reserve
for losses, as considered prudent by the Board of Directors.
VIII. Staff
21) KDFC will build up a technically qualified staff capable of carrying
the responsibilities which KDFC's objectives create, and able to
provide the services to clients which those objectives call for.
IX. Revision of Policies
22) Any proposal to revise this Statement of Investment and Operational
Policies shall be considered by the Board of Directors only after
each member has been given an adequate opportunity to study and
comment on the proposal, and it shall be approved at a meeting of
the Board of Directors by two thirds of all directors.

assets during the year 1976 was primarily due to the growth of its portfolio and
particularly of foreign currency loans. While their share in total assets remained
at the 1975 level of 81%, outstanding foreign currency loans grew from W42.6
billion to W71.2 billion at end-1976. This impressive 67% increase was caused
by the much higher level of disbursements of foreign currency loans in 1976 1/
which, in turn, was made possible by the shorter time period required for disburse-
ments of subloans funded by the U.S. $20 million commercial borrowings syndicated
by IFC. The share of domestic currency loans decreased as a percentage of total
assets from 6% to 3% at end-1976 because of the higher level of collections in
comparison to disbursements. The share of the equity investment portfolio
remained at 5%.
2.        Current assets (excluding the current portion of loans) almost doubled
to W9.5 million and accounted for 11% of total assets as against 9% only in 1975.
Payment of the November 1976 share capital subscription was partially responsible
for this increase as well as some W2.5 billion foreign currency deposits held by
KDFC from the proceeds of the IFC loan on behalf of several borrowers.2/ Fixed
and other assets increased rapidly in absolute terms from WO.3 billion to Wl.l
billion owing to expenditures on the construction of KDFC's new office building
which is expected to be completed around April 1977. The accumulated allowance for
portfolio losses stood at W1.1 billion at end December 1976 which represents
approximately 1.4% of the portfolio outstanding at that date and is more than
adequate in view of the quality of KDFC's portfolio.
3.        Liabilities.  The composition and growth of KDFC's liabilities is shown
hereunder:

ANNEX 14
Page 3
In keeping with the 67% increase in foreign currency loans outstanding, KDFC's
foreign currency borrowings grew by 67%. Domestic currency borrowings
consist of a Government subordinated loan which KDFC will start repaying in
1977. As indicated in the preceeding paragraph the growth of current
liabilities is somewhat artificial and excluding the W2.5 billion the level
of current liabilities remained at 3% of total liabilities.
4.        Outstanding loans from IBRD have decreased in relation to total
foreign currency borrowings over the last 4 years from 94% in 1973 to 82%
in 1975 when the first ADB loan was contracted and 68% at end-1976 with
the $20 million commercial loan coming on stream.
5.        Net worth.  KDFC's net worth stood at W9.6 billion as of December
31, 1976. Reserves and retained earnings accounted for 48% and had increased
by about WO.9 billion from their 1975 year-end level. Paid-in share capital
increased from W3.3 billion at end-1975 to W5 billion by end-1976. The W1.7
billion increase consisted of WO.33 billion stock dividends declared from
the 1975 net income and a W1.37 billion additional rights issue for cash.
6.        Capital structure.  The financial ratios appearing in Table 1
show that KDFC's capital structure has gradually become more debt-oriented
with the long-term debt/equity ratio increasing from 3.8:1 in 1973 to its
1976 level of 7.7:1 (as against an agreed limit of 8.5:1). This simply
indicates that the growth of KDFC's operations and consequently of its
borrowings has outpaced the growth of its net worth. KDFC's capital
structure, however, can still be considered sound given the institution's
managerial and staff capabilities and the quality of its portfolio. KDFC's
current ratio (including current portions of term loans and term debt) has
sizeably declined from a high of 2.4 in 1973 to 1.5 in 1976, but KDFC's
liquidity position is still adequate at that level.
Financial Performance

through 1976 are shown in Table 2. The composition of gross income and
expenses for the last four years is summarized below:

ANNEX 14
Page 5
Over the last 4-year period the growth rate of KDFC's gross income has
averaged 36% p.a., slightly less than the average growth of 45% p.a. of
the overall portfolio.l/ During the same period net income increased at
an average 25% p.a. Net income for the year 1976 amounted to W1.5 billion,
a 27% increase over the previous year. The composition of gross income has
not changed significantly since 1973 and income from loans accounted for
approximately 85% of total gross income over the last four years.
8.        Expenses.  KDFC has continued, to the extent possible, to keep
a tight control over its expenses. There has been a commendable reduction
in the level of operating expenses in relation to total assets, as reflected
in the improvement in the ratio of administrative expenses noted in the
following paragraph. The 42% p.a. average growth of KDFC's expenses over
the last four years has been primarily due to the increase in financial
charges (close to 49% p.a. on average). Financial expenses have consequently
increased in relation to total expenses from 73% in 1973 to 80% in 1976.
Provisions for portfolio losses in an amount of W301 million were made at
a rate of 1.4% of the incremental loan portfolio. These provisions were
set aside (to benefit from tax exemption) regardless of the actual level
of new arrears, which are practically inexistent (see paragraph 11 below)
and to that extent represent hidden earnings.
9.        Performance indicators.  Ratios of financial performance are
shown in Table 2. In spite of a declining trend in a few ratios KDFC's
overall financial performance remains entirely satisfactory. The relative
decline in gross income has been marginal; interest income from loan
portfolio which represents 85% of gross income has slightly declined from
11.4% in 1973 to 11.2% in 1976 (averaged on a monthly outstanding basis).
The decline in net income from 3.1% of average total assets in 1973 to
2.2% in 1976 is therefore essentially due to the increasing burden of
financial expenses. Financial charges have increased during the 1973-
1976 period from 5.8% to 6.5% of average total assets and have caused a
decline in KDFC's interest spread. On the whole, however, net earnings
are still satisfactory and high enough to allow adequately for both dividends
and increases in retained earnings. Net profit has increased in relation
to average equity from 15.7% in 1973 to 18.7% in 1976. Indicative of the
efficiency with which KDFC is managed is the reduction in administrative
expenses from 1.8% of average assets in 1973 to 1.2% in 1976. The debt
service cover has declined from a high of 1.7 in 1973 to 1.3 in 1976 which
is still adequate.
10.       With the exception of 1973 when a 15% cash dividend was declared,
KDFC's dividend policy since 1968 has been to declare a dividend of 10% in
cash and 10% in stock. Following the November 1976 increase in its share
capital KDFC declared a 20% cash dividend which is comparable to the current
level of cash dividends distributed by other private financial institutions
in Korea. In order to further build up its equity through retained earnings,
1/ Which is grossly inflated by the large disbursements of late 1976.



ANNEX 14
Page 6
KDFC envisages returning to its 10% cash/10% stock policy in the coming
years if this proves acceptable to its shareholders. The pay-out ratio
averaged 39% over the last four years and reached 48.5% in 1976. The book
value of KDFC's shares amounted to 192% of par value (W5,000 per share) at
December 31, 1976. Trading in KDFC shares has been moderate so far 1/ and
the depressed state of the Korean Stock Exchange, especially for stocks of
financial institutions, has brought the quoted price of KDFC share down
from W10,700 in January 1974 to W6,000 in January 1977.
Quality of Portfolio
11.       Table 4 attached to this annex summarizes KDFC's collection
performance and arrears situation over the last four years. By any standard
KDFC's performance in collecting loans has been outstanding over the period
1973-1976 and actually since KDFC's establishment in 1968. KDFC experienced
its first arrears problems in 1972 with six loans in arrears for over three
months at the end of that year. The financial measures enacted by Govern-
ment in August 1972 coupled with KDFC's intensified collection efforts had
by end-1973 reduced the number of loans in arrears to only two. At year-end
1975 and 1976 no loan was in arrears for a period exceeding three months.
Table 4 shows that over the last four years, collection ratios have ranged
from 98.2% to 99.4%. 2/  With some 59% of KDFC's outstanding loan portfolio
still in grace period the re-emergence of some arrears should be expected
in the future. Nevertheless the overall quality of KDFC's portfolio is
expected to remain excellent.
12.       Only some 27% of KDFC's outstanding loan portfolio is secured by
a mortgage on the borrower's fixed assets. All other loans are secured by
payment guarantees issued by local banks. Rather than reflecting a
deliberately conservative lending policy on KDFC's part, the preponderance
of payment guarantees is a consequence of the lending practice of Korean
commercial banks. Instead of sharing mortgages on a pari passu basis, Korean
banks usually insist on holding a mortgage on all assets of a company and
to issue payment guarantees to other lenders. This is also a way for these
banks to keep control over the total liabilities of their client firms and
to reduce competition from new lenders since all new secured borrowings are
subiect to their agreement. KDFC applies its high appraisal standards, and
thorough supervision work, to all projects financed by it, regardless of
the type of collateral involved (i.e., whether secured by fixed assets, or
by a bank guarantee).
1/ 4.5% of the average number of shares outstanding were traded in 1976.
2/ No loan reschedulings were made by KDFC in 1976. In 1975 the repayment
s-heduls of 3 loans totalling approximately Wl million (U.S. $2,000)
were extended by a year.

Projected Operations and Financial Performance, 1977-81
Industrial Investment Prospects
1.        The rate of growth of GNP over the Third Five-Year Plan period
(1972-76) averaged 11% p.a. The growth of the manufacturing sector, however,
was almost twice as fast during that period reaching an estimated 19.9% p.a.
Mining and manufacturing accounted for 36% of the 1976 GNP. Exports, and
in particular exports of manufactured goods, have been the engine of growth
of the Korean economy. Commodity exports increased at an average rate of
nearly 40% p.a. I/ between 1965 and 1975 and rose in proportion to GNP from
8.5% to 30.2%. Manufactured exports, which accounted for 65% of all commodity
exports in 1960, had risen to about 90% by 1976. The growth of the manufac-
turing sector spurred by buoyant exports has been sustained by a high level
of industrial investment. Fixed investment in manufacturing 1/ increased at
an annual rate of 34% over the Third Five-Year Plan period and as a share of
total investment it averaged 21.3% over the same period, a modest increase
over its level of 19.7% for the period 1967-71.
2.        The Fourth Five-Year Plan proposes to continue the strategy of
export-led growth. GNP is expected to increase at 9.2% p.a. with a growth
rate of 14.2% p.a. in the manufacturing sector. Exports of goods and services
are projected to grow at 16.8% p.a. with manufactured exports providing 94%
of incremental exports over the period 1976-81. To sustain the GNP growth
rate of 9.2% p.a. gross fixed investment is expected to rise at 7.8% p.a.
Gross investment would slightly decrease in relation to GNP to 26.2% from an
average of 26.9% during the Third Plan period. Manufacturing investment is
projected to account for 26.7% of total investment outlays during the Fourth
Plan, an increase of 2 percentage points over its 24.6% share in the 1972-76
period.
3.        The structural changes within manufacturing investment which have
begun to take place over the last few years will be further accentuated during
the 1977-81 period, with a larger share of funds going to heavy and chemical
industries (64% as against 60% during the Third Plan period). The share of
light industries is expected to come down to 36% of total investment outlays
as against 40% in the previous five-year period. Within the heavy and chemical
sectors, the share of basic metals, shipbuilding and chemicals will be reduced
from 44.8% to 36.9%. A significant shift in investment priorities within the
manufacturing sector is therefore contemplated in the Fourth Five-Year Plan
with major increases planned in the share of machinery (7.7%), electronics
(2.7%) and, to a lesser extent, non-ferrous metals (1.5%).

KDFC's Share of Industrial Investment
4.        Annex 2 shows that KDFC's disbursements over the period 1971-76
accounted for approximately 3% of the gross fixed capital formulation in the
manufacturing sector. 1/ KDFC's share of manufacturing investment financing
has actually varied over the last five years from a low of 2% in 1973 to a
high of nearly 6% in 1976. 2/ Such variations are a consequence of unfore-
seen delays, experienced by KDFC in raising additional resources, which can
adversely affect the level of commitments and subsequently of disbursements.
5.        Based on its assessment of resources, particularly in foreign
currency, likely to be available to it, KDFC has projected over the five-
year period 1977-81 total commitments of W 256.3 billion (US$528 million) and
total disbursements of W 243.8 billion (US$503 million). As against a yearly
real growth of about 8% in manufacturing investment assumed in the Fourth Plan
period, KDFC's disbursements are projected to increase at just under 15% p.a.
1/   In current prices.
2/   Reasons for this high level of disbursements in 1976 are outlined in
para 6 hereunder.



ANNEX 15
Page 3
Assuming a rate of inflation of about 7% per annum, the real growth in KDFC's
projected disbursements would work out at 8% p.a., which would keep pace with
the projected real growth of manufacturing investment over the Fourth Five-Year
Plan period. KDFC should therefore be in a position to just maintain the share
of its financing at about 3% of fixed investment, the same as in the last
five-year period.
KDFC's Business Forecasts
6.        KDFC's operational forecasts for the years 1977 through 1981 appear
in Table 1 attached to this Annex. Projected commitments are summarized below:

1978                       5,085                80,700          91,185
1979                       6,330                88,000         101,052
1980                       8,490               103,000         120,505
1981                      10,940               121,000         143,557
Total 1977-81        33,670               458,995         528,419
/a   Loans and investments.
KDFC's foreign currency commitments have jumped in 1976 by 64% over their 1975
level. This was partly the result of the "bunching" in 1976 of a relatively
high level of uncommitted approvals at end-1975 (approximately US$14 million 1/)
with commitments of loans approved during the year for another US$54 million.
The magnitude of this latter amount was attributable to KDFC's successful
efforts to expeditiously process loan applications financed from the proceeds
of the US$19.8 million commercial loan syndicated by IFC 2/ (which has been
1/   By comparison uncommitted approvals at end-1976 amounted to US$10.9
million only.
2/   Unlike lines of credit from IBRD/ADB, this commercial loan was credited
in full within a very short period following loan signing. It was there-
fore important for KDFC to itself disburse it quickly to sub-borrowers
so as to derive an income.



ANNEX 15
Page 4
fully committed and disbursed in the last two quarters of 1976). It would
not be reasonable to keep KDFC's staff under such pressure to expedite loan
appraisals and processing, and a more moderate increase in the level of
approvals in 1977 therefore seems justified. Total approvals which had in-
creased by 51% in 1976 will grow by a moderate 9.5% in 1977 while commit-
ments will marginally decline by 1%. On the whole the projected level of
operations for 1977 appears reasonable.
7.        As a consequence of the lower level of commitments, the 1977 dis-
bursements are expectd to fall to US$58.7 million from their level of US$69.5
million in 1976. KDFC's disbursements in relation to gross fixed capital
formation will therefore be lower in that year than the 6% achieved in 1976.
Using 1976 as a base year the nominal growth in KDFC's disbursements over
the period 1977-81 will be approximately 15% p.a. which, assuming an in-
flation rate of 7%, would represent a real growth of approximately 8%. Using
1977 as a base year, however, the nominal growth rate over the four-year
period 1978-81 will near 25% p.a. As mentioned above, a 15% annual growth
in KDFC's disbursements would, in real terms, maintain the share of KDFC's
financing of total fixed industrial investment at the 3% average reached
over the last five-year period. The achievement of this target volume of
business would depend primarily on KDFC's capacity to raise additional bor-
rowings, and because of the debt/equity constraints (para 16 below) the
level of such borrowings will itself depend on KDFC's capacity to expand its
equity base.
8.        A salient feature of KDFC's projections is the assumption that its
domestic currency financing will gradually increase in relation to KDFC's
total approvals from 7% in 1976 to 12% by 1978 and 15.5% by 1981, in view
of the steadily increasing availability of domestic machinery and equipment
in Korea. KDFC is aware of the need to raise more resources in domestic
currency to achieve the above objective and two bond issues have been planned
for 1979 and 1980.
Resource Requirements
9.        Domestic Currency Resources.  Total cumulative domestic currency
commitments for the years 1977 through 1981 are estimated to reach W 33.7 bil-
lion. At end-1976 domestic currency resources available for commitment
amounted to W 3.3 billion. The table below shows that, in order to achieve
the forecast level of domestic currency commitments, KDFC will have to issue
share capital for cash in 1978 and 1981 in amounts of W 3 billion and W 4
billion respectively. In addition, KDFC is tentatively contemplating two bond
issues of W 1 billion and W 2 billion in 1979 and 1980. Given the rates of
19% to 20% at which such bonds are currently being issued with two-to-three
year maturities, compared with KDFC's own lending rate of 18-20%, it would be
undesirable for KDFC to consider at present the issuance of domestic currency
bonds. MOF, however, has already taken 1/ and is considering further measures
1/   In March 1976.



ANNEX 15
Page 5
which would reorganize the bond market and allow issuance of new types of
corporate debentures with longer maturities and yields partially indexed
on commercial banks time deposit rates. Assuming that, as a result of an
overall review of the interest rate structure, KDFC is in a position to
raise domestic resources on the bond market and to relend such resources
with a reasonable spread, KDFC could respond to the Government's wish to
see an increase of its domestic currency financing.

10.       Foreign Currency Resources.  KDFC's total foreign currency commit-
ments for the period 1977-81 are projected at approximately US$459 million.
Uncommitted foreign currency resources amounted to US$39.3 million as of end-
December 1976, consisting of US$7.1 million from IBRD and US$32.2 million
from ADB. This uncommitted balance is expected to be fully utilized by the
middle of 1977. As indicated earlier, the commercial loan syndicated by IFC
had been fully committed and disbursed by end-December 1976.

million inc.1sr-ng the proposed IBRD loan of US$70 million, which KDFC ex-
pects to fully commit by mid-1979. KDFC intends to intensify its efforts
at mobilizing foreign commercial funds in the years to come, so as to grad-
ually reduce its reliance on borrowings from official sources such as IBRD
and ADB. As indicated in the following table KDFC is tentatively aiming
at raising UtS$125 million, or 26% of the 1977-81 borrowing program from
commercial sources.

Up to mid-1967, KDFC had relied exclusively on official lenders for its for-
eign exchange resources. These, totalling US$221.8 million 1/ consisted of
five IBRD loans for US$148.8 million, two loans from ADB for US$70 million
and a $3 million loan from USAID. In May 1976, however, KDFC obtained its
first foreign commercial loan, syndicated by IFC, for an amount of approxi-
mately US$20 million. Diversification of its foreign currency resources is
an important objective for KDFC and its new development strategy proposes
to gradually reduce the proportion of official funding to about two-thirds
of its resources by 1981. Whether KDFC will be able to achieve its target
volume of foreign commercial borrowings, however, will depend on factors
1/   Net of cancellations.

outside KDFC's control, such as the situation of the international capital
markets and Korea's overall capacity for borrowing in these markets.
12.       Specifically, KDFC has initiated discussions with a view to rais-
ing a second commercial loan of up to US$30 million from its foreign
shareholders including IFC which may materialize by the end of 1977.
Projected Financial Position and Performance
13.       Projected balance sheets through 1981 appear in Table 2.  Based on
its forecast volume of business KDFC's loan and investment portfolio will
increase at a rate of approximately 25% p.a. from W 78.4 billion at end-
1976 to W 247.3 billion by end-1981. The share of KDFC's portfolio in total
assets will increase from 89% in 1976 to 95% as of December 31, 1981. KDFC's
total assets will consequently increase at just under 25% p.a. and rise from
W 87.8 billion at end 1976 to W 259.7 at end 1981. Provisions for possible
portfolio losses will be set up at 1.3% of the outstanding portfolio plus
receivables at the end of each fiscal year. Accumulated reserves and pro-
visions will marginally decline as a percentage of KDFC total portfolio 1/
from 7.2% in 1976 to 6.7% in 1981, which will be more than adequate in the
light of the excellent condition of the portfolio.
14.       On the liability side, KDFC's term debt will grow at a rate of
about 25% p.a., in keeping with portfolio growth, from W 73.2 billion as of
December 31, 1976 to W 225.8 billion by end 1981. The growth of KDFC's
equity will be slightly below that of liabilities with 23.5% p.a., bringing
total equity to W 27.5 billion in 1981 from the 1976 level of W 9.6 billion.
KDFC's debt/equity ratio will consequently rise from 7.7:1 in 1976 to 8.2:1
in 1981. However, the growth of KDFC's equity will not be uniform since
two large share capital increases of respectively W 3 billion and W 4 billion
are planned in 1978 and 1981 which will substantially lower the debt/equity
ratio from its level of the preceding years. The ratio will reach 8.5:1 in
1977 and 9.3:1 in 1980. Over the five-year projection period, 60% of equity
growth will be attributable to retained earnings and stock dividends.
15.       As stated in paragraph 11 above, KDFC will need to borrow foreign
exchange funds in increasing amounts in the next five years to maintain its
target volume of operations. KDFC's borrowing capacity, however, is depen-
dent on the size of its equity by means of a debt/equity limit. In view of
the quality of KDFC's management and staff and of its portfolio the Bank has
agreed to progressively increase the contractual limit from 3:1 at the time of
KDFC's establishment in 1968 to 8.5:1 in 1976. At end-1976 KDFC's debt/equity
ratio stood at 7.7:1, well within the agreed limit. It is expected, however,
that KDFC will come quite close to reaching 8.5:1 by the end of 1977, and
projections show that, based on the forecast business volume and contemplated
borrowings, ratios of 8.8:1 and 9.3:1 would be reached in 1979 and 1980 in
spite of the planned additions to equity through retained earnings, stock
dividends and new share issues for cash.

ANNEX 15
Page 8
16.       KDFC realizes the importance of continuing to increase its equity
as a means of sustaining the expansion of its operations, but it feels that
the W 3 billion and W 4 billion share capital increases planned for 1978
and 1981 must currently be considered as the maximum acceptable by the market
after the W 1.37 billion increase of November 1976. The dividend policy
envisaged by KDFC over the next five years (see para 20 hereunder) is quite
conservative and given the projected net income levels, higher retained
earnings and stock dividends would be unacceptable to the shareholders. As
for higher net profits, these would only be achieved by increasing KDFC's
interest spread. KDFC's interest spread over the last 4 years has actually
shown a declining trend because of the relatively stable level of interest
rates charged to borrowers 1/ while the cost of its borrowings (e.g., from
IBRD and ADB) has been growing. The possibility for KDFC to charge higher
interest rates is limited in practice in view of the need for KDFC to main-
tain its competitive position vis-a-vis the Korea Development Bank and
Government's reluctance to agree to even nominal increases.
17.       In view of the foregoing a further relaxation of the debt/equity
limit is necessary if KDFC is to achieve its operational program and maintain
its share of the financing of manufacturing investment. Moreover KDFC has
forecast withdrawals from the second commercial loan starting in 1978, should
this loan materialize earlier than expected, the 8.5:1 limit is likely to be
exceeded by end-1977 given the quick disbursement pattern of such borrowings.
It is therefore recommended that the contractual debt/equity limit of 8.5:1
be raised to 10:1. This proposed relaxation in KDFC's debt limitation is jus-
tified on the basis of KDFC's excellent operational performance, the strength
of its management and staff, and the high quality of its loan portfolio
which at present is free of all arrears. Projections show that the new limit
of 10:1 would accommodate forecast borrowings through 1981 and probably beyond.
18.       Projected income statements for the years 1977 through 1981 appear
in Table 3. Profits after tax will increase from an expected W 2.1 billion
in 1977 to W 4.4 billion in 1981 at an approximate rate of 20% p.a. Profit-
ability ratios, also appearing in Table 3, show that net income expressed
as a percentage of either average equity or average total assets will margi-
nally decline over the projection period from its 1976 levels. This is
entirely due to a gradual, albeit marginal, reduction in the interest spread
which, as a percentage of average assets, decreases from 4.4% in 1976 to 3.8-
3.9% by 1980/81. This narrowing interest margin is not due to a decline
in gross income, which on the contrary, is expected to increase slightly
as a percentage of average assets from 10.9% in 1976 to 11.6% by 1981; such
increase, however, is more than compensated by a rise in financial charges.
KDFC indeed expects its interest expenses to increase from their current
i/   On the foreign currency side, KDFC's lending rates increased from a uni-
form 10% p.a. in the 1968-76 period to 10.5%-11.0% since 1975. On the
domestic currency side, interest rates increased from 15.5% in 1975 to
18%-20% in 1976.



ANNEX 15
Page 9
level of 6.5% of average assets to 7.7% by 1980. Expressed as a percentage
of average term debt, interest charges will rise from 7.7% in 1976 1/ to
8.8% by 1980.
19.       KDFC is not unduly conservative in assuming that the average cost
of its borrowings is bound to increase by close to 1% over the next five
years. This reflects the projected increasing share in its total resources
of commercial borrowings, the cost of which will be substantially higher
than that of official funding (e.g., from IBRD and ADB). Although a marginal
increase in its average lending rate is projected by KDFC, there is very
little KDFC can do to raise it significantly above present levels. During
negotiations for the last IFC syndicated loan, the Government indicated
that it was not prepared to authorize KDFC to reflect in its lending rate
the higher cost of its borrowings. There are no indications that the Govern-
ment has changed its position in this respect. Hence, the assumption of a
decline in the average interest spread. Administrative expenses are pro-
jected to remain at their very low 1976 level of 1.2% of average assets
throughout the projection period.
20.       KDFC's dividend policy will remain substantially the same as in the
past years, with cash dividends of 10% and stock dividends of 10% declared
out of each year's net income. In the years 1978 and 1981 when it plans to
make fresh share issues, KDFC is projecting cash dividends of 20% (with no
stock dividend). A 10% cash dividend is quite conservative by Korean stand-
ards and KDFC may have to adjust its future policy in order to strike an
appropriate balance between the objective of increasing cash returns to
shareholders to render future share capital issuances more attractive, and
the need outlined above to expand the equity base through retained earnings
and stock dividends. With the proposed policy, the pay out ratio would be
in the 25% to 30% range in the years when a 10% stock/10% cash dividend is
expected and reach 49% in 1978 and 1981 when a 20% cash dividend will be
declared.
21.       Projected cash flow statements appear in Table 4.  The debt service
ratio is expected to remain at the satisfactory level of 1.2 to 1.3 throughout
the projection period. The interest cover ratio 2/ will marginally decrease
from 1.4 through 1978 to 1.3 from 1979 through 1981 which is still adequate.
22.       On the whole KDFC's financial performance and structure is expected
to remain quite satisfactory over the next five years. Profitability although
slightly declining in relation to average total assets and equity will remain
adequate. Projected liquidity, reserves and debt service ratios all reflect
a very sound financial structure.
1/   This, however, is a slight underestimation because averaging the year
end 1976 term borrowings gives too much weight to the late withdrawals
on the IFC syndicated loan.
