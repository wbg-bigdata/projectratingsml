F. Results Framework Analysis

Project Development Objective (from Project Appraisal Document)
The program's Project Development Objective (PDO) was to support Mauritania's central
and local governments to: (i) improve living conditions and employment opportunities in
the main towns of Mauritania, especially in slums; and (ii) strengthen the institutional
framework and capacity for urban and land management.

Revised Project Development Objectives (as approved by original approving
authority)
The revised objective consisted of providing support to Mauritania's central and local
governments to: (i) improve access to basic services and infrastructure in targeted urban
areas; and (ii) increase access to micro-finance and income-generating activities for
populations living in slums.

H. Restructuring
During the preparation of the additional financing, the project had already achieved the
targets for its ten PDO indicators and eight out of the ten intermediate outcome indicators,
and had disbursed 97 percent of its funds. As a result, the additional financing was
entirely allocated to scale up the component related to basic infrastructure. In parallel, the
Government has significantly increased resources allocated to microcredit. Taking in
account the situation above, the PDO was lightly redrafted in the Additional Financing
Project Paper to reflect the focus of the remaining activities (access to basic infrastructure
and microcredit).

1. Project Context, Development Objectives and Design

1.1 Context at Appraisal

Country Background: In 2000, Mauritania was facing a trend of rapid and uncontrolled
urbanization, ranging from less than 4 percent in 1962 to the estimated rate of 61 percent,
with more than 67 percent of the urban population concentrated in Nouakchott (about
700,000 inhabitants) and Nouadhibou (100,000 inhabitants). In addition, unemployment
ranked high at about 35 percent and the majority of the urban poor were nomads who had
lost their economic base and most of their possessions due to persistent droughts and
resulting desertification. As a result, the rate of rural migratory inflow into the urban area
had substantially exceeded the capacity of both State and municipal governments to
extend necessary urban infrastructure and services and generate employment.

Urban Sector Background: As rapid urbanization had not been met by adequate
investments in urban infrastructure, there was a proliferation of slums around the major
cities, leading to low living standards and poor access to basic services such as roads,
water, sanitation, electricity, and solid waste disposal services. The uncontrolled
urbanization was also accompanied by unemployment and poverty, which affected about
35 percent of urban inhabitants. Furthermore, the absence of adequate and properly
maintained infrastructure and inefficient and costly urban services were undermining the
competitiveness of Mauritanian cities.

The urban sector was also constrained by a weak to non-existent legal and regulatory
framework and had not been able to implement much needed decentralization reforms
that have been introduced since 1986, including resolving inadequate financing to
municipalities. Furthermore, due to an inefficient land tenure and management system,
regularization of land property rights was a lengthy and difficult process leading to the
emergence of an informal and speculative land market and proliferation of squatter
settlements.

Rationale for World Bank Involvement: The World Bank’s overall strategy for the urban
sector in Mauritania was anchored in the 2001 Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)
articulated around four strategic pillars: (i) the acceleration of private sector-led growth;
(ii) growth anchored in the economic environment of the poor; (iii) developing human
resources and ensuring universal access to basic infrastructure services; and (iv)
institutional development and governance. The 2003-05 Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) focused on capacity building for decentralization and strengthened administrative
capacity for Municipalities. In parallel, the Government issued a policy aimed at reducing
urban poverty as advocated in the PRSP.

The 2008-11 CAS for Mauritania reiterated the necessity to: (i) accelerate growth and
maintain macroeconomic equilibrium; (ii) continue to anchor growth in the economic
environment of the poor; (iii) develop human resources and generalize access to basic
social services; (iv) improve good governance and capacity building; and (v) reinforce



                                              1
strategic oversight of programs, monitoring, evaluation, and coordination. The Urban
Development Project (UDP) assisted the Government of the Islamic Republic of
Mauritania (GIRM) to address those challenges but a follow-up program would improve
on its results and achievements. The challenges associated with the goal of achieving
inclusive growth are closely linked to Mauritania’s shortcomings in poverty reduction,
namely: (i) the need to reduce inequalities in the urban areas where they are highly
visible and sources of popular discontent; (ii) the slow pace of decentralization that
suffers from weak administrative capacity; and (iii) weak civil society organizational
capacity that undermines its active participation in public affairs. Therefore, the
sustainability of the UDP investments is dependent on further reforms and targeted socio-
economic policies capable of ensuring sustainable development.

1.2 Original Project Development Objectives and Key Indicators (as approved)

The original Project Development Objective (PDO) was to support Mauritania’s central
and local governments to: (i) improve living conditions and promote employment
opportunities in the main towns of Mauritania, especially in slums; and (ii) strengthen the
institutional framework and capacity for urban and land management.

1.3 Revised PDO (as approved by original approving authority) and Key Indicators,
and reasons/justification

Cancellation of the Adaptable Program Loan (APL) structure: Implementation
delays occurred during the first phase of the program, due mainly to political instability
which, in 2008, pushed the Bank to put all disbursements on hold. Given the important
changes in the local context, and implementation by the Government of some activities
planned for the second phase of the APL, the APL second phase was no longer relevant.
Instead, the Government has requested support to develop a National Integrated Program
for Decentralization, Local Development, and Employment. The Bank has welcomed this
request and is already preparing a new project to support the Government Program.

An Additional Financing (AF) was approved by IDA Board on June 25, 2010 to scale up
project Component 1 (Provision of basic urban infrastructure). At this moment, the initial
project has already achieved the targets for its ten PDO indicators and eight out of the ten
intermediate outcome indicators, and had disbursed 97 percent of it funds. In addition to
the Bank AF, the Government has significantly increased resources allowed to
microcredit. So the remaining activities were mainly focused on basic infrastructure and




                                             4
microcredit. To reflect these changes in the AF Project Paper, the PDO was slightly
revised.

The revised objective consisted of providing support to Mauritania's central and local
governments to: (i) improve access to basic services and infrastructure in targeted urban
areas; and (ii) increase access to micro-finance and income-generating activities for
populations living in slums.

The revised PDO and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are the following:

            PDO                                 Outcome Indicators

1.4 Main Beneficiaries

The main objective of the two phases of the project was to improve the living conditions
of at least 541,590 persons: 281,590 living in slums, 100,000 resettling from rural areas
or from other urban areas, and 100,000 in other urban areas, directly through targeted
interventions, and indirectly through support for economic development (40,000 persons),
improved urban and land management, and empowerment of communities. The primary
beneficiaries were poor families in Nouakchott (431,000 persons) and Nouadhibou
(10,000 persons), and to a more limited extent, in the regional capitals (100,000 persons).
The project also empowered communities to participate in local decision-making and in
project implementation through an adequate institutional framework and support from
specialized organizations. Local governments and governmental agencies benefited from
capacity-building activities to strengthen their technical and managerial capacities in
urban and land management. Local NGOs, small entrepreneurs, and consultants benefited
from targeted vocational training activities and public works programs. During the
Additional Financing preparation, the number of beneficiaries, in Nouakchott and in the
12 capitals of regions, for the first phase of the APL, was increased to 370,000 (52% of
whom are women), to take in account the scaling up of some components.

1.5 Original Components (as approved) (see Annex 3a)

The Urban Development Project was designed to contribute financing to the GIRM
investment program for urban sector development with the objective of improving the living
conditions of slums dwellers and reducing poverty. The estimated cost of the Adjustable
Program Loan (APL) (for Phase 1 and Phase 2) was initially projected to be at US$192.67
million. The total cost for the UDP’s first phase was estimated at US$99.06 million and IDA
financing totaled SDR 55.8 million (US$70.0 million equivalent). The project consisted of
four components which were identified at the time of appraisal. These were:

   • Component 1. Provision of basic urban infrastructure in the main cities, principally
     in slums, and serviced sites (cost: US$75.85 million; IDA credit US$54.30 million)

   • Component 2. Microcredit (cost: US$6.90 million funded by GIRM)

   • Component 3. Institutional and capacity building (cost: US$8.05 million funded
     entirely by IDA)

   • Component 4. Auditing, monitoring, and operating costs of implementing
     agencies (cost: US$6.56 million, IDA credit of US$5.92 million)

1.6 Revised Components

The project components were not revised, but two of them were scaled up and the
allowed funding has consequently increased. Component 1, provision of basic urban
infrastructure in the main cities, has benefitted from the additional financing provided by
IDA; and Component 2, microcredit, has benefitted from additional funds provided by
the Government. The projected PDO was lightly revised for the additional financing, to
take this scale-up into account.

1.7 Other significant changes

A changing national situation that impacted project implementation

Since the start of project implementation in April 2002, political instability in Mauritania
affected the implementation of the UDP. In June 2003, an attempted coup undermined
the institutional stability of the country. A second coup succeeded in breaking down
constitutional order in August 2005. From that date until March 2007, the country has
experienced a transition period, with legislative and municipal elections in October 2006
and presidential elections in April 2007. As a result, a large group of mayors, the UDP’s
main stakeholders and partners, was renewed. Just when they started to show stronger
ownership of the project and its objectives, another coup, in August 2008, disrupted the
recently restored constitutional order. As a consequence, the Bank put disbursements
related to the Mauritania portfolio on hold for 15 months (from August 2008 to October
2009). During this period, the GIRM has relied on the national budget to continue paying



                                             6
the ongoing contracts, avoiding interruption in already engaged contracts, preventing any
complaints from suppliers.

The Bank and the GIRM agreed to resume the UDP’s implementation by mid-December
2009. A retroactive extension was necessary as the project was supposed to close in June
2009. The extension was approved for two years (until June 30, 2011) by the Operations
Policy and Country Services Vice Presidency (OPCVP) on October 29, 2009 to allow the
project to complete all its activities and to rebuild confidence among stakeholders. An
Additional Financing was approved on June 2010 with an extension of the closing date to
June 30, 2012 to ensure implementation of the additional activities.

2. Key Factors Affecting Implementation and Outcomes

2.1 Project Preparation, Design and Quality at Entry

Project Design: Many alternatives were considered in selecting the most appropriate
instrument to support the Government’s long-term program. An integrated approach
combining a classical urban development project, a public works program, a slum
upgrading operation, a community action program, was finally adopted as more
appropriate. An APL with two five-year phases was preferred to a Sector Investment
Loan, as slum upgrading is a ten-year program, and capacity building and
decentralization strengthening require a longer period. The approach was very innovative,
in the context of the Country which has never implemented such an integrated urban
program. Although the project has not benefited from a formal Quality at Entry Review
(which was optional at that time), the quality at entry is considered satisfactory. In fact,
the unique restructuring that was done during the long implementation period of the
project, was just a simple reformulation of the PDO, in order to take into account the
scale-up of some activities which were not predictable at the preparation stage.

Lessons learned from urban projects and ongoing activities carried out under the Urban
Infrastructure and Pilot Decentralization Project (Cr. 2835-MR), as well as from other
urban and water supply projects in Mauritania and from overall Bank experience, have
been incorporated in the design of this program. Decentralization experience in
Mauritania suggests that the participation of communities in project preparation is critical
for adequate identification of priorities and subprojects, their timely and effective
implementation and sustainability, ownership, and local capacity development.
Ownership, a clear vision, and political commitment to project objectives ensure strong
leadership, strong participation of communities, and availability of counterpart funds.
Therefore, full community consultations and involvement have been an integral part of
program preparation and have also been continued during implementation. However,
technical assistance support is needed to boost local capacity. Interventions have been
(and continue to be) targeted through assessments and based on thorough consultations
with beneficiaries. Design was simple and has taken into account low institutional
capacity at local government levels, especially in secondary cities, and the early stage of
development of community-based organizations. The project has relied on NGOs and
consultants to provide implementation technical assistance to communities and has



                                             7
supported technical assistance to relevant local governments, through the Association of
Mayors. Slum upgrading was limited to Nouakchott which had the largest slums and
basic institutional and human capacity and strong leadership. Along with investment
programs, activities have supported the development of central and local governments'
capacities in urban and land management, as well as the development of capacities of
communities and the private sector.

The lessons learned from Bank projects since 1970 include the need for decentralization
of infrastructure service delivery and management to appropriate local levels with
adequate local financial revenue generation. In addition to providing basic infrastructure,
to alleviate poverty it is equally important to create jobs, generate income, prevent the
creation of new slums, secure access to land, and improve housing.

 As the implementation of the first phase of the APL has taken over 10 years (which was
the period planned for the two phases). Given that many of the activities to be financed
under the second phase were done by the Government (slums rehabilitation), or by the
UDP additional financing (scale up of access basis infrastructures and micro credit), there
was no need to prepare a second phase as initially planned. Instead, the Government and
the Bank have agreed to prepare a new operation that will support a national integrated
program for Decentralization, Local Development and Youth Employment (cf para. 2.5).

2.2 Implementation

Implementation of the project components was satisfactory. The GIRM and all implementing
agencies were instrumental in ensuring that, despite the difficult context described above,
project implementation was successful and that all components were completed before the
project closing date and became operational as expected. Institutional oversight was provided
by the Prime Minister who chaired an Inter-Ministerial Committee (CIS) in charge of the
urban development program. This committee included the Ministers of Interior, Finance,
Economic Affairs and Development, Housing and Urban Planning, Equipment and
Transport, Hydraulics and Energy, the General Secretary of the Government, the
Commission on Human Rights, Poverty Reduction, and Integration (CDHLCPI), and the
Mayor of Nouakchott. The CIS was supported by a technical committee under the
chairmanship of the Director of Programming and Studies, and includes representatives
from all concerned sectors, civil society, and the private sector. After the mid-term
review, and in order to confirm the increasing importance of urban issues, the Presidency
of this committee was transferred to the Prime Minister Adviser, in charge of
Decentralization and Urban Planning. Thematic subcommittees were also set up. All
committees and subcommittees had reviewed the program preparation and were
operational by project implementation. A Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), reporting to
the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Development and the Coordinating Committee,
was in charge of project coordination, monitoring, reporting, and auditing, In addition,
the PCU was in charge of the implementation of the capacity-building component.

Strict adherence to implementation arrangements was ensured by the PCU during the 10
year period of project implementation, no delay or lack in the quality with regard to the



                                             8
different reports and documents to be produced by the clients. All audits were transmitted
on time and unqualified, and quarterly financial monitoring report was regularly prepared
with the required quality and transmitted to the Bank in the agreed time. No procurement
or safeguard issue has been recorded. The implementation of the more complex operation,
regarding safeguards policies (the rehabilitation of the slum Kebba of El Mina, involving
the involuntary resettlement of more than 2,300 families), was rated highly satisfactory
according to an independent evaluation conducted by an international consultant firm,
under the Bank supervision.

In addition to these achievements, when the Bank put disbursement on hold for 15
months, the Government mobilized its own resources to continue paying the ongoing
contracts and related operating and costs.

The program was closely supervised by the Bank team. A local staff was fully dedicated to
the project during the first years, and after the Mid-Term Review (MTR), in March 2005,
the Task Team Leadership was transferred to Nouakchott-based staff, who enjoyed an
excellent relationship with the PCU and all other stakeholders. All implementing agencies
also contributed to an efficient monitoring of project components.

Project implementation through city contracts was used to support project
implementation in the secondary cities. City contracts were signed for each of the 12
secondary cities involved in the project in order to address municipalities’ limited
managerial capabilities in dealing with planning and monitoring of works. A “bonus-malus?
clause was inserted in these contracts in order to motivate and incentivize municipalities to
be more performing, and has shown to be effective.

An evolving institutional setup led to more efficient project implementation. The
project institutional setup was refined based on lessons of implementation, especially from
the pilot’s restructuring operation of the Kebba in Nouakchott’s El Mina District, which
highlighted the need to make the institutional framework flexible and adapted to the
institutional reality on the ground. These changes concerned the separation of water
management from electricity with the creation of the National Water Company (SNDE) and
the National Electric Company (SOMELEC), the creation of ANAT (National Agency for
Land Development) as the executing agency for Component C of the project. ANAT was
later absorbed by ISKAN (a government company in charge of land development, housing
and real estate management) that took over SOCOGIM (Société de Construction et de
Gestion Immobilière en Mauritanie). A Ministry of Housing, Urban Affairs, and Land
Management (MHUAT) was also created, as well as a special ministerial department in
charge of environmental and sustainable development policies within the prime ministry.

2.3 Monitoring and Evaluation Design, Implementation and Utilization

Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Design: A project performance monitoring
framework was designed to provide the Bank and the GIRM with the appropriate data and
indicators (with some baseline values and target values) about component implementation
and their results on the ground. Given the pilot nature of the project, many baseline values



                                             9
were not available. However, the Implementation Status and Results Report (ISR) format
allowed an objective monitoring of key performance indicators (see Annex 2-b) for project
outcomes and intermediate outputs in the areas of basic infrastructure services, slum
upgrading and land development as well as effectiveness of microcredit operations in
generating demand for public housing, land development and income generating activities.
Other indicators for capacity building and project implementation and institutional
strengthening were also used to assess the degree of success of the project.

M&E Implementation and Utilization (see Annex 2-b for KPIs): Data collection adhered
to the Project Appraisal Document (PAD) guidelines and the borrower information system.
The data collected for outcome and outputs indicators were monitored through an agreed
reporting format. The Government provided the Bank with monthly reports on project
implementation progress, quarterly progress monitoring reports, quarterly financial
management reports, annual information about progress on key entity and sectoral
performance indicators, and other information as the Bank required. These arrangements
worked in a satisfactory manner and were always rated satisfactory in the ISRs. In addition,
the Bank team periodically conducted site visits to monitor implementation progress,
compliance with environmental and social safeguards, and engage in discussions regarding
benefits achieved from the investments. The Bank team also interacted regularly with
various project stakeholders, including all implementing agencies, NGOs, and the
Association of Mayors. GIRM provided a retrospective analysis on performance and inputs
for planning purposes, producing and submitting to the Bank for review the Quarterly
Project Report, containing M&E data. The quarterly reports resulted in discussions on all
aspects of the project ranging from procurement, engineering, KPIs, safeguards and finance
to decentralization. These reports also provided a close monitoring of all covenanted targets.
Furthermore, the social development outcomes were being tracked by CDHLCPI which was
in charge of monitoring poverty indicators, including in urban areas. The monitoring was
supplemented by social assessments carried out by the Bank during the MTR and at the end
of the project.

Through good M&E systems, the Bank was able to avoid many pitfalls. During project
implementation, the Bank has identified major problem in a timely fashion and has
undertaken needed adjustments, to avert bottlenecks and other constraints, avoiding and/or
solving potential problem. Major adjustments were done during the MTR and the Additional
Financing approval, or by specific amendments. They were essentially related to
reallocation of funds, indicators, and target value.

In addition, the Government has conducted many surveys to measure impacts of the project,
and to provide additional information to the data base on urban and decentralization issues.
One of those surveys was conducted at the beginning of the project to establish a baseline
for El Mina neighborhood and the other targeted areas in Nouakchott. Two years later,
another survey was conducted to measure impacts of the project, and a third one was
conducted an additional two years later. A technical audit of the built infrastructure and
equipment was conducted every two years to check the quality of the product, and how it is
managed and maintained. Municipalities were audited every year, and the collected data was
used by the General Directorate of Local Government for the creation of a data base on local



                                             10
finance. The Government has also put in place, at the Urban Development Agency, an
observatory for the city of Nouakchott to follow its evolution and provide update
information on the land occupation and planning.

2.4 Safeguard and Fiduciary Compliance

Environmental and Social Safeguards (ESS): The UDP was rated “Category A? on
environmental and social safeguards management. The environmental and social safeguards
process was initiated during project preparation and appraisal stages. An Environmental
Assessment was triggered and the project prepared a Strategic Urban Environmental
Assessment. The identified Potential Environmental and Social Impacts were:
Resettlement caused by land acquisition in the slum areas to be improved will be a major
impact of the project. A Social Assessment and a Land Acquisition and Resettlement
Action Plan (LARAP) have been prepared, which includes the impacts of on-site
sanitation in waterlogged and temporarily flooded areas, impacts of solid waste disposal
sites, impacts of construction activities, increased pressure on the fragile coastal zone,
which would increase the risk of inundation for parts of Nouakchott from the sea,
monitoring of groundwater levels of fossil groundwater resources, impacts of new or
improved infrastructure, such as cattle markets, the artisanal fish landing site on the
beach, and the fish market. Environmental studies have been carried out, and mitigation
plans elaborated under these studies have been incorporated in the Strategic Urban
Environmental Assessment (SUEA) and Environmental Management Plan (EMP).

Compliance with the Bank’s Environmental and Social Safeguards: The EMP and the
LARAP implementation were satisfactory. After the completion of the RAP implementation,
an independent evaluation was conducted by an international consulting firm under Bank
supervision and has rated it highly satisfactory. The Bank latest supervision, including a
field survey, found that the preparation and the implementation of the investment projects of
the UDP did adhere to a single scheme which was to implement projects on public sites not
used for other economic activities by individuals or business entities. Most of the time,
these sites were located on the right-of-way of main arteries. This was the case of electricity,
water supply and sanitation projects. No project for rehabilitation of markets necessitated
the acquisition of land. The construction of schools and health centers was made on public
land provided by the concerned municipalities. In all the cases, the Bank team was attentive
to this issue and had no knowledge of any complaint in Nouakchott. Resettlement programs
of the Urban Development Agency (ADU) were made according to the resettlement
standards of the Bank and the Mauritanian national legislation and have been the subject of
relocation Plans reviewed and approved by the Bank. Other activities of the UDP were
covered by a resettlement policy framework outlined and enforced by the Bank.

Financial Management: The Borrower’s financial management (FM) systems were
upgraded to take into account the reporting system as required by the Bank/IDA. The
Project Coordinating Unit ensured close and independent control over all sub-components
and their implementation. The PCU was strengthened by a finance department and an
accountant assisted by a local accounting firm whose role was defined prior to credit
effectiveness. All other implementing agencies (AMEXTIPE, SOCOGIM, SONELEC and



                                              11
ADU) strengthened their FM capabilities during their partnership with the Bank and were
able to enhance the financial accountability and transparency of their operations. The
reporting framework for the project included a quarterly Project Management Report (PMR),
an equivalent of the interim unaudited financial report, prepared in an agreed format with
the Bank/IDA (detailed in the Project Implementation Plan) as well as yearly audit reports.
PMRs were prepared from information generated by all implementing agencies. The FM
arrangements were considered to accurately account and report on the project financial
resources and expenditures under the various components financed by the World Bank/IDA.
FM arrangements under the UDP were implemented in a manner satisfactory to the
Bank/IDA. FM measures involved all participating implementing agencies. These measures
ensured that flows and expenditures were in conformity with the project management
manual and Bank guidelines.

Procurement: Procurement of goods, works and consultant services was carried out in
accordance with Bank/IDA guidelines under IBRD loans and IDA credits. The Borrower
provided a detailed procurement plan that included relevant information on civil works and
goods. Procurement under the UDP was generally satisfactory with no major issues faced
during implementation. All procurement plans established by implementing agencies and
consolidated by the PCU were in conformity with Bank/IDA guidelines. There were 299
contracts for consultant services, of which 259 were awarded to national firms, 120
contracts for works of which 105 contracts were awarded to national enterprises, and 158
contracts for the supply of goods and these were almost all to domestic/national suppliers.
Contracts resulted in creating important income generating activities for the national
economy, including for local/regional enterprises. Procurement was rated satisfactory in
the project’s final Implementation Status and Results Report.

2.5 Post-completion Operation - Next Phase

Based on the project success, the Government has: (i) prepared a national slums
rehabilitation strategy, and started implementation of a large program with the objective of
zero slums by end of 2012 (in December the rate was around 90 percent); (ii) revised the
land management legal framework to facilitate access to land property rights, particularly
for vulnerable and poor populations; (iii) increased resources enabled microcredit to scale up
access to credit and promote self-employment in poor neighborhoods; (iv) continued to
finance and implement a large infrastructure program to improve access to basic services in
urban areas; (v) elaborated an incentive-based strategy to encourage rural population to be
more grouped around settlements with the minimum size to justify services delivery with
affordable cost and has already succeeded with 48 small villages grouped now in two
localities; (vi) A national company was created to develop equipped plots and public
housing and is already implementing many programs around the Country; and (vii)
approved a new policy letter related to Decentralization and Local Development confirming
its commitment to continue supporting and enhancing local governments, through in
particular, a sound fiscal transfer and institutional capacity building program. Regarding this
point, this Government is preparing a national program to develop Decentralization and
Local Development. A new funding-window will be created to provide performance-based
grants to local governments. The objectives of this window is to provide more sustainable



                                              12
and significant resources to local governments, and to use those resources as an incentive to
push local governments to deliver better services to the population, and ensure good
management and efficient maintenance of equipment and infrastructure. The Bank is
involved in the preparation of this program and is preparing a new operation in support.
Annex 1-c shows the GIRM budgetary allocations to finance additional infrastructure for the
benefit of the urban population and its development.

3. Assessment of Outcomes

3.1 Relevance of Objectives, Design and Implementation
The current Government PRSP-3 (2011-2015), and the PRSP-2 (2008-2010) have the same
five principal objectives, and are articulated around the same pillars: (a) accelerating
economic growth and maintaining macroeconomic stability; (b) making growth more
inclusive by developing the growth potential and productivity of the poor; (c) improving the
potential of the Mauritanian people and their access to basic social services; (d) enhancing
governance and institutional development; and (e) improving planning and monitoring and
evaluation systems. The achievement of the PDOs, before and after the Additional
Financing restructuration, is fully supporting the Government and the Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) priorities listed above. The improvement of living conditions in the major
cities, the creation of employment opportunities, the capacity building, and the institutional
reforms aiming to improve governance both at, central government and local government
levels, are particularly contributing to PRSP’s pillars (c), (d), and (e), and are, to some extent,
contributing to the other pillars. The Bank is preparing a new Country Partnership Strategy
(To be submitted to the Board in March 2013). The design of this CPS is based primarily on
providing support to Mauritania for the implementation of PRSP-3 with an emphasis on
inclusive growth, improving service delivery, capacity building and governance, and job
creation, and therefore, the project’s objectives are also relevant for the CPS.

The fact that the Government, in its current and past strategies, has maintained, despite the
high political instability, the project’s objectives as priorities, is confirming that the project's
objectives and design are highly relevant, and that the diagnosis and analysis made during
the project preparation are still relevant. It shows also that studies carried out during the
project preparation (about cities strategies, slums population, economic potential, housing,
microcredit, etc.), and fed into project design were relevant. The fact that all achieved results
are contributing to the PDO and to the overall development objectives of the Government
confirms that activities planned under the project components were appropriate to reach the
objectives, and so were the implementation arrangements. The performance indicators were
well-chosen and allowed a good monitoring of the project achievements. However, the
initial PDO was too broadly defined and contained higher level objectives. That issue was
addressed through the subsequent restructuring which revised the PDO to properly reflect
the project objectives. This restructuring was included in the additional financing granted by
the Bank to scale up the very successful component related to access to basic infrastructure.

Finally it is important to note that, despite the political instability, the Project Coordinator
has never been changed and this has facilitated the relationship between the Bank and other
counterparts. This also has helped to manage the more difficult political situations,



                                                13
particularly that the Bank has put all disbursement on hold, as the Coordinator was able to
get some funds from the Government to continue paying ongoing contracts.

3.2 Achievement of Project Development Objectives
The PDO for the project and for the APL, as in the PAD, is to support Mauritania's central
and local governments to: (i) improve living conditions and promote employment
opportunities in the main towns of Mauritania, especially in slums; and (ii) strengthen the
institutional framework and capacity for urban and land management.

Five groups of indicators were set up to measure achievements of PDO:

1.      Increased access to basic services: (a) increased coverage and consumption of
water (from a daily average of 15 liters per person in 2000 to 25 liters per person by 2005
and 35 liters per person by 2010); (b) reduction of water prices in slums, from US$2 to
US$3 per cubic meter in 2000 to less than US$1 per cubic meter by 2005 and less than
US$0.75 per cubic meter by 2010; (c) improved sanitation, by providing 10,000
additional latrines by 2005 and 30,000 by 2010; (d) increased access to roads, schools,
health centers, electricity and services; and (e) improvements regarding access to potable
water, electricity, roads, schools, health centers, sanitation and markets for at least
163,240 slum dwellers by 2005, a total of 281,590 slum dwellers by 2010, and 220,000
other urban inhabitants.

2.       Increased access to credit for, and results in: (a) income-generating activities
(2,500 credits by 2005 and 5,000 by 2010); and (b) improved shelter and sanitary
facilities (7,500 houses by 2005 and 15,000 by 2010);

3.     Increased support for economic activities, as measured by the number of activities
created or improved conditions of work (for 20,000 workers in each phase);

4.      Formalized links between community organizations and the governance structure,
increased involvement of community-based organizations in decision-making, and the
provision of infrastructure services (full consultations on urban development plans and
participation of communities in service delivery);

5.      Additional indicators to measure achievement of PDOs: (a) Streamlined
legislation and regulations governing urban planning; (b) improved technical and
financial municipal capacities for infrastructure maintenance and service delivery
(training of municipal staff, increased municipal financial income and transfer of funds to
municipalities); (c) operational land management and information systems including the
fiscal system (with 15,000 land titles registered and delivered in ten years, and 3,000
before 2005); (d) simplified and accelerated procedures for tenure regularization; and (e)
positive change in land market in slums.

The target values for some of these results were formally revised during the project
implementation to take in account the scale-up of some components and also the reality
on the ground. The amount of credit provided to slum dwellers was increased from MRO



                                            14
12,500 to MRO 89,446, and the number of jobs increased from 50,000 to 143,000. The
target value for some intermediate outcome indicators was also formally revised.

Although only the first phase was implemented results of the project to date, are as
follows: (a) people benefitting from basic infrastructure improvement in the regional
capital (110,000 inhabitants); people benefitting from slum upgrading (181,000
inhabitants, with secure land tenure, basic infrastructure, with creation or improvement of
225,000 jobs, affordable serviced land and/or shelter (for 50,000 inhabitants); (b)
technical assistance to community associations, Non-Governmental Organizations
(NGOs), have benefitted from microcredit, and trainings, 160,895 people or entities have
benefitted from credit (i) 100,042 land titles were regularized and registered, benefitting
slum populations in particular; (ii) 5,145 households have benefitted from improved
construction, and 2,946 have benefitted from improved sanitation; and (iii) the biggest
part of the 100,042 credit was mainly for income-generating activities (mainly NGOs and
micro-enterprises for services and construction); and (c) fiscal transfer from the Central
Government has increased by 2,000 percent. In addition, municipalities have received
substantial technical assistance through the city contracts signed by the Mayor and the
Wali (Governor, Representative of the Government at Regional level). For the
Government, the purpose of these contracts, as a counterpart to the funds granted for
investments and the technical assistance for capacity building, was to engage
municipalities to be more performing in terms of their own resources mobilization,
services delivery, participation of the communities (associations and NGOs) in the
management of local affairs, etc.

The Additional Financing approved by the Board on June 2010 has reformulated the
PDOs to take into account that achievement of the initial PDO had been realized, and to
focus the objective of the additional financing on scaling up the provision of basic
infrastructure and microcredit. The revised PDO was to support Mauritania's central and
local governments to: (i) improve access to basic services and infrastructure in targeted
urban areas; and (ii) increase access to micro-finance and income-generating activities for
populations living in slums. In addition to the results in the paragraph above, the number
of direct project beneficiaries has reached 400,000 inhabitants, 68 percent of the target
for the APL, while only the first phase of the UDP was implemented.

All PDO indicators related to roads, water, electricity, sanitation, access to microcredit,
the number of direct beneficiaries, job creation, capacity building, and land access and
registration, have been reached or have exceeded the target value, confirming the
achievement of both the initial and revised PDOs. Based on the above information, the
achievement of objectives is satisfactory, though the impact of the project has far
exceeded the listed PDO and intermediate outcomes indicators. When the project started,
no resources from the national budget were allocated to finance urban infrastructure,
slum upgrading, or microcredit. The fiscal transfer to the local government was negligible.
Urbanization problems were known but there was no real commitment to face them, and
there was a feeling of helplessness against the immensity of the problems. When the first
impacts of the project came out, the Government became more confident of its capacity
to change things, and to started preparing policies and putting more resources to address



                                            15
decentralization and urban development in a more sustainable manner. As such, the
project has succeeded not only in achieving its development objective, meeting or
surpassing its results indicators, and delivering all expected outputs, but the project has
succeeded in changing Government behavior regarding the Urban and Decentralization
agenda. This is reflected by the important programs under implementation or under
preparation (paragraph 2.5 above). One of the more visible illustrations of this enormous
impact is the El Mina slum rehabilitation which was financed by the project and has
benefitted 22,000 households. The success of this operation has triggered a national
program aiming at having zero slums in the country by end of 2012. This operation and
the Government’s program which followed, has allowed more than 480,000 slum
dwellers to have access to land property rights and to improved basic infrastructure.

                                    Box 1: Microcredit

  The Microcredit component funded entirely by the Government included
  activities ranging from public housing; microcredits: creation of jobs and
  income-generating activities; training and promotion of local employment;
  development of micro-projects in targeted neighborhoods. The initial amount
  allocated to this component at project preparation was US$6.0 million and
  totaled US$20.61 million by the end of the project. The results were largely
  superior regarding the income-generating microcredit. The success of the
  microcredit component is attributable to institutions such as the CNDHLCPI,
  Beit-El-Mal and the Twize program. Activities such as the land servicing
  operation that benefitted from the funds resulted in the construction of 5,269
  housing units in Nouakchott; 615 housing units in Nouadhibou; 1,500 latrines-
  fences units; 34,000 housing microcredits granted; 160,895 microcredits for
  income and employment-generating activities; 1,300 trained professionals
  including 400 in the construction sector and 900 micro-entrepreneurs
  representing 95 micro-projects in the project areas.


Impact of the Twize Program

The UDP’s objective of poverty reduction through access to decent housing was
accompanied by a culturally and socially adapted approach called Twize. This
approach was based on collective community participation articulated with solidarity
programs in order to finance and build housing ‘modules’ for poor families. Twize’s
achievements in Nouakchott and Nouadhibou range from the local production of 5,900
cost-controlled quality housing ‘modules’ (room or plot enclosure and latrine); the
granting of 65,000 classic micro-loans destined to improve inhabitants’ incomes and
housing; micro-loans accessible to inhabitants organized in Twize groups; the training
of 1,200 professionals, 800 of whom are in the construction sector—a priority in the
framework of the project; and support for the joint implementation of 95 urban,
economic and social micro-projects. The housing scheme’s success (satisfying 84
percent of targeted households) depended on the quality of the social, technical and
financial support throughout the entire process.



                                            16
3.3 Efficiency

Project Costs

Actual project costs totaled US$156.34 million, representing a global project cost
increase of 23 percent (the estimated costs were US$126.96 million). The increase was
not due to a cost overrun, but due to additional funds mobilized by the Government and
the Bank to scale up some subcomponents. The Government has increased the
microcredit component by 198 percent from an estimated US$6.9 million to an actual
value of US$20.61 million; this increase was due mainly to the demand for microcredit to
generate income creating activities (US$20.41 million), the need to reduce relative
poverty in the targeted areas, and the extension of the project period from 5 to 11 years.
The impacts in terms of employment generation have been consistent with the lending
scale generated by the implementation of this component. The institutional and capacity
building component has increased by 115 percent (US$19.5 million from US$7 million),
to allow the project to accompany institutions during the whole project period. Actual
projects costs for activities under the Additional Financing totaled US$30.8 million for an
estimate of US$27.9 million, representing a cost overrun of 10.5 percent due to the
increase of the constructions costs which was entirely financed by the Government.


Economic and Financial Analysis (see Annex 3)

The PAD economic analysis was limited by available data and unable to replicate the
initial analysis. At the project preparation stage, only some major subprojects for
Nouakchott were identified. For the regional capitals, the project provided funds to
municipalities, and in each municipality, the Municipal Council had to prioritize resource
allocation. As such, the analysis did not address investments in secondary cities or
account for many project impacts, such as improvement of the living conditions of slums
dwellers (e.g., reduction in water-borne diseases (typhoid and cholera) and morbidity) or
income generating activities. In addition, the initial data for analysis is not available.
During preparation of the Implementation Completion Report (ICR), however, an
analysis was done, though based on incomplete data, on the Economic Rate of Return
(ERR) and Net Present Value (NPV) for the cattle and fish markets.

Infrastructure for economic activities: It was initially assumed that private operators were
going to assure the operation and maintenance of cattle and fish markets and that the city
of Nouakchott would have established concession contracts with one private operator for
each of the markets. Private operator income was to be generated from fees from users of
the market facilities. It was expected that those private operators would manage the
markets in an efficient manner, based on commercial practices. The Borrower provided
the Bank with very limited data on these aspects, namely the amount of the concession
paid by the private operators for the cattle and fish markets to the municipality of
Nouakchott.




                                            17
Cattle Market: The amount of the cattle market concession was fixed at MRO
53,380,000/year to be paid to the municipality which invested a total of MRO
592,689,926. Given these figures and taking into account the same assumptions of the
appraisal (20 years of operations and a discount rate of 0.12), the resulting calculations
provide an ERR of 6.40 percent and a negative NPV of MRO 173,156,264.

Fish Market: Like the cattle market, the project assumed private operation of the fish
market. The concession fee paid by the private operator was fixed at MRO
1,260,000/year and the municipality invested a total of MRO 358,302,793. Given these
figures and taking into account the same assumptions of the appraisal (20 years of
operations and a discount rate of 0.12), the resulting calculations provide a negative ERR
of 17.92 percent and a negative NPV of MRO 311,510,240.

The low concession cost was justified by the fact that the Municipality imposed a limit on
rental rates for shops and stalls to allow small vendors access to the two markets.
However, the Municipality could increase shop rental rates when activities become more
profitable and vendor demand for access increases. This rental rate increase will be
reflected in the amount paid by the concessioner to the Municipality. This was not taken
into account in the calculation above, nor were taxes paid directly to the Municipality by
users of the two markets, or the modern markets’ impacts on hygiene and health. As such,
the ERR is certainly higher than as calculated here. In addition, some subsidies for these
investments could be justified by their economic and social impacts, particularly the
number of activities and employment generated. As the initial data used to calculate ERR
in the PAD is not available, it is possible that the calculation had accounted for these
factors.

An alternative and more realistic ex-post economic analysis was performed for the Urban
Development Project over the lifetime of the project, i.e., 2001-2012. It is expected that
the benefits will accrue beyond the project implementation but were not calculated.

The project has two main components: Component 1 to improve living conditions and
promote employment opportunities in main urban areas; and Component 2 to strengthen
the institutional framework and capacity for urban and land management. Both
components had the potential of generating health, environmental, economic and social
benefits but quantification of the latter benefits are more difficult to perform and were not
calculated. Hence, the ex-post economic analysis covered five sub-components under
Component 1, which was restructured in 2010, and include: (i) Completion of Water
Supply and Electricity Distribution Network; (ii) Completion of Road Network; (iii)
Slum Upgrading; (iv) Sanitation System and Shelters; and (v) Microcredit.

Deriving the economic analysis benefits is made difficult by the complexity and
heterogeneity of the health (e.g., less water-borne diseases although vector-borne could
not be considered), environmental (less urban air emissions and water effluents, etc.),
economic (numerous benefits although job creation was not accounted for in the analysis)
and social (numerous in terms of access, quality of life, etc.) outcomes from components
improvement. Nevertheless, the benefits that were calculated include the water consumer



                                             18
service with the tariff reduction to under US$1 per cubic meter, the health improvements
due to both improved water and improved sanitation, less flooding days due to improved
drainage, and paved road construction in urban areas that led to the increased the price of
land (30% to 200%) depending on the areas. 1
The selected benefits that were calculated are just a fraction of the project benefits. In
addition, the benefits have been aggregated and compared to IDA’s annualized and
shadowed costs for the project over the 2002-2012 periods. Hence, it was not possible to
value each component separately.
NPV, ERR, MERR and PV Benefit/Cost Ratio
The project economic costs and benefits per selected sub-components are detailed in
Annex 3. All the costs associated with the component are considered and annualized over
the first five years of the project life (additional clarifications are in Attachment 1 of the
Annex 3).
The project is economically viable with a NPV discounted at 10% reaching US$7.6
million with an ERR of 18% and a Marginal Economic Rate of Return (MERR) of 14%
and a Present Value Benefit/Cost (PV B/C) ratio of 1.2. No sensitivity analysis is needed
as this is an ex-post evaluation with the benefits considered accruing during the
implementation of the project. Nevertheless, with proper operations and maintenance, the
benefits will continue accruing over the next years.
Economic Analysis Benefits
Consumer Surplus Benefits
The consumer surplus has been calculated for the targeted population of 181,035 in the
slums of Nouakchott. The total consumer surplus amounts to US$1.1 million annually
over the period (Table 1.3, Annex3).

Health Risk Reduction for the Water and Sanitation
As many of the benefits of reliable and improved water supply and improved sanitation
are difficult to quantify, the economic analysis is limited to: (i) reduced incidence of
diarrheal disease; (ii) reduced mortality from diarrheal disease; and (iii) reduced mortality
from infectious diseases associated with improved nutritional status in young children
from reduced incidence of diarrhea.
The population that benefitted from improved water coverage is equivalent to 87,229 in
all the targeted cities in 2005 with the targeted population reaching 106,337 in 2012,
whereas the population that benefitted from improved sanitation is equivalent to 21,799
in 2005 with the targeted population reaching 26,574 in 2012. A 50 percent reduction in
disease and mortality is expected from having access to improved water and a reduction

of 40 percent from having access to improved sanitation. 2 Benefits start accruing as off
2005 (Table 1.4, Annex3).
The health associated with water and sanitation improvements are illustrated in Tables
1.4 and 1.5 respectively in the Annex 3. Benefits have been considered for improved
access to potable water and improved sanitation based on the Project Development Unit
evaluation and start accruing in 2005 and reached on average US$2.9 million and US$0.8
million per year respectively.

Flood Reduction Benefits

The flood reduction benefits are illustrated in Table 1.7 in the Annex 3. The people are no
longer affected by flooding starting 2005. A monetization in terms of gross national
income/capita per day by 30 days of forgone flooding by the population no longer
affected by flooding (23,305 residents), which is assumed to represent a share of the
gained economic activity as reported in the above mentioned evaluation report.

Impact of Road Construction on Land Value

The hedonic value increase of the lots around the urban roads (150 meters on average
from each side of the urban roads) with the very conservative net incremental price of
land was estimated at US$5 per square meter. Some 26,600 linear meters were
constructed in urban areas and land prices increased by 200 percent in some cases. An
average increase of US$5 per square meter was adopted across the board based on
professional judgment. The area positively affected by the construction of houses hence
affected 7,920,000 square meter equivalent to one time gain of US$39.6 million.
Unfortunately, the roads subcomponent was not considered as the traffic count was not
performed at the end of the project. Moreover, the electricity subcomponent was not
considered in the analysis although the evaluation reported an increase of the land value
where the electricity provision was introduced.

3.4 Justification of Overall Outcome Rating
Rating: Satisfactory

The overall rating of the project is satisfactory on the basis of its high relevance (as
discussed in Sections 2 and 3), satisfactory achievement of the PDO (as discussed in
Section 3.2), and efficient implementation (as discussed in Section 2.2). The project
achieved all of its PDO indicators. During the project implementation period, all
implementing agencies (PCU, ADU, ANAT/ISKAN, AMEXTIPE, and CNDHLCPI)
were well-coordinated and made significant contributions to the successful completion of
project implementation and the satisfactory achievement of the PDO. The implementing
agencies’ performance allowed all components to be completed despite difficulties and

delays, suspension of disbursements caused by political events, and a difficult
institutional environment. Finally, significant progress has been achieved in the urban
sector and in the provision of infrastructure services to the poorest populations of
Mauritania.

3.5 Overarching Themes, Other Outcomes and Impacts
(a) Poverty Impacts, Gender Aspects, and Social Development
The impact of the program on Government action on poverty alleviation is evident as
shown by the results indicators. The project particularly targeted slums and poor
neighborhoods in both Nouakchott, and the regional capitals, and the impact has been
positive and visible, in terms of improved living conditions (see Annex 2 on outcomes).
The project activities in the neighborhoods and households that lived in precarious
housing areas resulted in noticeable and positives changes both at the housing level and
in terms of socio-economic services such as access to roads, income-generating activities,
schools, electricity, drinking water, health-care centers and markets. The pilot project of
Kebba of El Mina has initiated a process of participatory and integrated development that
is being scaled up by the Government nationally and which will gradually become
mainstreamed in all the regional capitals. In the Kebba of El Mina (the oldest of the
slums), the social impact has been positive as slum upgrading actions have led to the
relative improvement of living conditions and social cohesiveness among most
inhabitants. The pilot in El Mina has also had positive impacts on the attendance of girls
at schools and this has been felt by all targeted. Housing conditions after relocation were
also improved and this has been felt by more than 70 percent of households. Moreover,
inhabitants believe that they have better access to transport infrastructure and about 65
percent of the households surveyed see an improvement in the access and contact with
parts of the city of Nouakchott and the country. The success of the El Mina pilot has
impacted communities in other slums who have started to claim the same treatment for
their slums. That has pushed the Government to start the implementation of its large slum
rehabilitation program without waiting for donor support.

In addition, this project supported key policy choices on how to address poverty in
Mauritania, drawing from numerous studies across multiple themes, from urban growth
strategy to adapted strategies for the promotion of employment, and income generating
economic activities. The project initiated institutional reforms and decentralization aimed
at giving municipalities and civil society more weight in the decision making process
leading to investments and project choice.

(b) Institutional Change/Strengthening

The Urban Development Project has changed the public sector’s approach to dealing with
urban issues. Before the project, urbanization was considered just a dangerous
phenomenon emptying rural areas, and the best way to limit this exodus was to let the
cities deal with their problems to make them less attractive. Investment priorities were
channeled to rural zones in order to maintain population in their “terroire? or homeland.
When the UDP started, no other funding was available for urban development; no
strategy was prepared to deal with the main problem (slums rehabilitation, land tenure,



                                            21
housing, employment, etc.). In 2010, during the preparation of the Additional Financing,
the Bank has requested from the Government the list of ongoing, or already confirmed
financings allocated to the cities involved in the UDP (Nouakchott and the 12 regional
capitals). The amount was US$443 million. The project has demonstrated the need and
the impact of investments in urban areas, and both Government and donors started to
mobilize more funding. All programs mentioned above (para 2.5) were launched.

The institutional strengthening component has put in place important mechanisms and
changes in the way government institutions and municipalities are managed. Overall, the
progress made in the management of municipalities has led to improving the
effectiveness of their work and strengthening their institutional capacity. As result of this,
the Government was convinced to transfer more resources to local Governments and to
put in place a sustainable enabling mechanism. The UDP initiated a progressive
decentralization process and resulted in setting the foundations for sustainable local
development. The mechanisms introduced under the UDP, such as technical assistance,
partnership agreements and city contracts, will need to continue to be improved and
adapted to the needs of the municipalities so they are able to play the role that is
delegated to them.

The Government is now preparing a large national program to support decentralization
and local development. In addition to a very important capacity building component, this
program will set up a new window in the Regional Development Fund, which will
provide performance-based grants to local governments. Participation, transparency,
accountability, maintenance, own-resources mobilization will be among the major
performance indicators to be eligible to this new window. The Bank is involved in the
preparation of this program, and will support the Local Governments Development
Project, under preparation.

(c) Other Unintended Outcomes and Impacts (positive or negative)

There were no unintended outcomes or impact from project implementation.

4. Assessment of Risk to Development Outcome
Rating: Moderate

The overall level of risk to the development outcome is rated moderate. While
municipalities’ resources and capacity remain insufficient to ensure good maintenance of
equipment and infrastructures financed by the project, the commitment shown by the
Government to continue increasing fiscal transfer and improving capacity building of
local governments is significantly improving the prospects for sustainability of the
project’s outcomes. In addition, the physical components of the project are relatively
sustainable and many of them are maintained by governmental entities (water and
electricity investments are maintained by the respective national utilities in charge of
urban water and electricity; local roads benefit regularly from the national roads
maintenance program; health facilities are benefitting from cost recovery system; markets’
maintenance is often included in the concession contracts). Some other achievements of



                                             22
the project are irreversible (access to land property rights, rehabilitation of slums,
microcredit, housing, etc.). Policies and institutional reforms supported by the project
have continued to be supported by the different governments, despite the great political
instability of the Country during the project implementation period.

The Government commitment: The Government is now preparing a large national
Decentralization and Local Development Program. In addition to a very important
capacity building component, this program will establish a funding-window including
performance-based grants which should aid the municipalities in undertaking adequate
maintenance of the infrastructure and deliver the basic services. Participation,
transparency, accountability, maintenance, and own-resources mobilization, will be
among the major performance indicators to be eligible under this new window. The Bank
is involved in the preparation of this program and will support it through the “Local
Government Development Project? under preparation.

5. Assessment of Bank and Borrower Performance

5.1 Bank Performance
(a) Bank Performance in Ensuring Quality at Entry
Rating: Satisfactory

The World Bank’s performance during identification, preparation and appraisal of the
project is rated satisfactory. The Bank had good knowledge of sectoral issues and context
through previous projects and assistance to the Mauritanian Government. The Bank’s
knowledge of the Mauritanian economy and infrastructure sectors was significant in the
formulation of a targeted PDO in line with the strategic transformation of the urban sector.
The Bank’s assistance was sustained by a strong partnership and good working
relationship with all the stakeholders, including the PCU, ADU, ANAT/ISKAN,
AMEXTIPE, CNDHLCPI, the Mayors Associations, municipalities and sector NGOs.
This helped the Bank team and the GIRM counterpart to define feasible component
options and setup an implementation framework in line with the Bank's procurement and
applicable safeguards. The PDO focused on outcomes for which the GIRM and
implementing agencies were held accountable and risk assessment focused on appropriate
risks and the ratings were realistic.

The preparation team also ensured that the final Project Implementation Plan
incorporated details of investment components and subprojects. The Bank team carried
out assessment of safeguards and compliance measures, as well as a financial
management assessment during the preparation phase (refer to Annex 6 of PAD). The
Bank team helped the Borrower to formulate the required Environmental and Social
Policy Procedures framework needed for project implementation; a Strategic Urban
Environmental Assessment made sure that the Government provided the initial
Environmental Management Plan and a Land Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plan.
Moreover, a number of required measures were put in place to ensure quality at entry
which contributed to successful implementation. These were:




                                            23
•      Project and subsidiary Agreements approved and signed by all implementing
       agencies involved in project implementation and benefitting from the IDA credit
       proceeds, including: SOCOGIM, SONELEC, ADU and AMEXTIPE.
•      Adoption by the Government of the Environmental Impact Evaluation (EIE) and
       the Environmental Management Plan and submission of the Social Impact
       Evaluation Final Report (SIE);
•      Establishment of model/standard bidding documents for planned procurement
       activities and submission of bidding documents for works for the first 12 months
       with IDA’s non-objection (El Mina restructuring bidding documents, and
       technical assistance).

By effectiveness, the Bank team had delivered a product tailored to the GIRM investment
priorities and implementing capacity in compliance with procurement, financial
management, and safeguards guidelines.

(b) Quality of Supervision
Rating: Satisfactory

The World Bank’s performance during supervision is rated satisfactory. Since
effectiveness, the Bank supervision team carried out 25 implementation support missions
with site visits over the eight year implementation period. Sufficient budget and staff
resources were allocated and the project was adequately supervised and closely
monitored, including through delegation of day-to-day supervision responsibilities to
Nouakchott-based staff, who proved highly effective. As of 2005, the Task Team Leader
for the project was based in-country. The ICR mission took place in September 2012.
Supervision of project implementation was strengthened by a systematic collaboration
between the Bank, the PCU and the implementing agencies’ project teams, and relied on
an appropriate skills mix. The Bank team was continuously involved in all aspects of
implementation to ensure that physical investments were carried out, that disbursements
occurred as planned, and difficulties and implementation problems were resolved.
Submission of progress reports, PMR, and safeguards compliance reports ensured that
supervision provided both parties with information to allow them to track progress and
take corrective actions when needed. The Bank's supervision tracking system (ISR and
mission aide memoires) provided much needed status information about the project, and
required implementation ratings and compliance with covenants.

The Mid-Term-Review was carried out in October 2004. At the time, the Bank team
flagged issues relating to the low disbursement level (21%) which was due to delays in
the implementation of works. Attention was also focused on the Regional Development
Fund (3% of the national budget) that was crucial to the transfer of Government resources
to the municipalities and their capacity to ensure adequate support and maintenance of
their infrastructure.

Issues related to Safeguard Compliance: The Bank team has closely supervised
implementation of the Land Acquisition and Resettlement Action Plan (LARAP) for
rehabilitation of the slum Kebba of El Mina, involving the involuntary resettlement of


                                           24
more than 2,300 families. It was rated highly satisfactory according to an independent
evaluation conducted by an international consulting firm, under the Bank supervision.
After the success of this operation, the Government has rehabilitated, with its own
resources, some other slums. The Bank team undertook (in October 2010) a full review of
safeguards compliance of the involuntary resettlement activities that affected inhabitants
of the two slums of Hay Sakan and Arafat (which were under rehabilitation at that
moment), and found that compliance measures were consistent with the RAP that was
prepared by the Government for the UDP. The team had found that the key requirements
of OP 4.12 had been respected, and formulated a set of recommendations to improve the
outcomes of the resettlement activities implemented by the Government and bring them
to full compliance with OP 4.12 requirements. The Government had confirmed its
commitment to implementing all those recommendations.

The Bank team was continuously involved with the PCU to resolve delays due to
disruptive institutional and political events and temporary cessation of disbursements. As
project implementation was constrained by these events, it delayed procurement and
completion of works. Project implementation resumed by the end of 2009 and
disbursements were authorized by the Bank. Issues were resolved and activities
proceeded towards completion according to the planned schedule of the Additional
Financing and closing date extension agreement. Continuous involvement by the Bank
team and the PCU’s use of its own monitoring and evaluation system were instrumental
in ensuring that the project components were successfully implemented and completed
with a close to 100 percent disbursement rate.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Bank Performance
Rating: Satisfactory
As the Bank’s performance in ensuring both quality at entry and quality of supervision
was rated satisfactory, the overall bank performance is rated satisfactory.

5.2 Borrower Performance
(a) Government Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The GIRM identified the development of the urban sector as vital for sustained and
inclusive economic growth and poverty reduction and has taken decisive steps to improve
legal and policy frameworks. In compliance with program objectives, the Government
issued an official Sector Policy statement that outlined a program of actions and
institutional measures that supported the project. In spite of the implementation cycle
being undermined by political events that led to a hold on project disbursements and
delays of works, strong project ownership by the Borrower provided the required and
continuous commitment of the Government to the project. In this sense, the
Government’s performance is rated satisfactory. The rating is justified based on the
adequate performance in the institutional oversight of the project. Despite governance
and institutional disruptions that affected the project life cycle, Governmental capacity
and commitment was maintained and ensured adequate funding and legal and regulatory




                                           25
frameworks for project implementation, including the implementation of the
decentralization process and the participatory mechanism.

(b) Implementing Agency or Agencies Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

All implementing agencies and stakeholders (PCU, SOCOGIM/ANAT/ISKAN, ADU,
AMEXTIPE CNDHLCPI, the Mayors Association, and municipalities) were always
available to the Bank supervision teams and worked together to resolve issues during
project supervision. Project ownership by the GIRM was crucial to the successful
implementation of this project. Institutional support ensured continuous monitoring and
support for loan disbursement and related financial measures such as counterpart funding,
compliance with credit covenants and safeguard measures.

The PCU played a significant role in providing transparent oversight of project
implementation and its performance is rated satisfactory. This rating is based on the PCU
efficiency in ensuring the monitoring and evaluation of the project activities and
components were implemented in relative compliance with established timelines,
disbursements reached 100 percent of funds, and closing occurred as planned on June 30,
2012. The project has not only met all PDO indicators but in some cases outperformed
Key Performance Indicators, thus meeting all development outcomes.

Compliance with financial, legal agreements as well as timely reporting was also
achieved during implementation, as the PCU and its project team was strongly committed
to the project's successful implementation. The use of IDA’s procurement guidelines,
compliance with Environmental and Social Safeguards, as well its role in mitigating
implementation risks, allowed the PCU to be a valuable Bank partner.

The ADU, SOCOGIM/ANAT/ISKAN, AMEXTIPE, SONELEC and SNDE completed
all the works and executed all the activities for which they were contracted. They
complied with terms and covenants of the credit agreements as well as those included in
their respective project agreements. The project coordinating unit (PCU) ensured that the
implementing agencies were audited throughout project implementation. The audits of
the implementing agencies underscored their good performance across the board. The
PCU was also highly effective in addressing some inherent deficiencies of the
construction sector (bottlenecks in the construction sector awaiting a Government
decision on revision of construction prices, deficiency of a number of contractors and a
lack of proactivity of executing agencies). The PCU accomplished its role to the
satisfaction of the Government and the World Bank.

(c) Justification of Rating for Overall Borrower Performance
Rating: Satisfactory

The Borrower has fully satisfied its obligations and in many cases, gone beyond them. In
term of respecting its commitments, the Government has regularly produced required
documents (audits, Financial Monitoring Report (MTR), quarterly reports, etc.). In terms


                                           26
of counterpart funds, the Government has mobilized more than the planned amount,
increasing by three the microcredit funds and providing additional resources to many
cities, to complete financing of their subprojects. In addition, when the Bank held
disbursements following the 2008 coup, the Government mobilized funds to continue
paying the ongoing contracts, avoiding complaints from suppliers.

In term of ownership, the Government is continuing the ownership, as with its own
resources, to implement and scale up the main program components: slum rehabilitation,
improving access to basic infrastructure, fiscal transfer to local governments, and
microcredit.

6. Lessons Learned

The main lessons learned from the design and implementations of the project are:

Project Design

•       The integrated approach for an urban project is very relevant, but is complex and
needs more time and more attention to be implemented efficiently;
•       When an urban project is able to achieve some sound and visible impacts, it will
be able to trigger sustainable institutional changes regarding urbanization perception and
policies.

Approach: Project vs. Program

•       Project approach is not the more efficient way for sustainable capacity
building: Although municipal capacity improved during project implementation, it
declines at the project’s end if efforts are not sustained in a government-led
programmatic approach. So, developing local governmental capacities requires a national
program, based on sustainable resources and strong political commitment that eventually
will be supported by donors.

Sustainability of Microcredit

Generating income-activities could be developed with appropriate microcredit: The
project demonstrated the feasibility and sustainability of microcredit operations for
generating income activities in Mauritania: The Beit El-Mal microcredit institution has
been active since 2009 with 30,400 new clients annually. It is a profitable institution and
does not require any subsidy.

Project Implementation and Impacts on Slum Rehabilitation Operations

•      Slum upgrading has limitations when there is a lack of established appropriate
regulatory frameworks for land development in an urban environment. For instance,
because of a weak land administration that cannot prevent squatters in public spaces, the
cost of slum rehabilitation operations could dramatically increase when new slums are


                                            27
formed. Therefore, an appropriate and rigorous compensation policy coupled with an
efficient land ownership control system for illegal land occupation will be necessary for
successful slum rehabilitation.

•      Impact of slum upgrading on land development programs for low-income
people. The amount paid by low-income people to have access to land property rights is
very low as compared to the existing land market value. Therefore, it is a real risk that
beneficiaries might sell their lots at current and higher market prices, and reconstitute
new slums. Depending on local conditions, additional arrangements have to be put in
place to ensure that only targeted people are benefitting from such programs, and will
keep this benefit.

Annex 2 -a: Outputs by Components

a) Provision of infrastructure and Nouakchott basic urban services. This
   consisted of: (i) setting up equipment in the districts of Kebba (shanty town) of El
   Mina, Riyadh, Teyaret and Dar Naim; and (ii) the construction of infrastructure in
   support of economic development. Fully completed activates include: all activities
   related to the pilot resettlement operation of El Mina Kebba; construction of pits
   for individual latrines, road paving/surfacing, and the construction of community
   facilities; the upgrading of vulnerable neighborhoods, including the land
   development in Arafat, and development operations and required infrastructure for
   under-equipped neighborhoods (which were programmed for the 2nd phase of the
   program). In addition, the construction of the cattle market, paving of the access
   road, development of the non-industrial fishing zone, construction of landfill,
   improved dirt road/street network (using improved/stabilized dirt surfacing), are
   also fully completed. Project beneficiaries include 377,000 people, 52 percent of
   whom are women. Furthermore, 181,035 people (for a target of 163,000) in
   upgraded slums have access to improved services and 26,574 people have access
   to improved sanitation.

b) Provision of infrastructure and urban basic services in the 12 regional
   capitals: This component consisted of works carried out as part of the initial
   funding and as part of the additional financing. These included schools at Zouerate,
   renovation of Rosso’s main market structure, and rehabilitation of Aioun’s urban
   water supply system.

c) Upgrading/Site Preparation and Development in Nouakchott. The IDA credit
   financed 884 plots for public housing development. This component was
   implemented by ANAT (as a result of SOCOGIM‘s reform). Subsequently the
   ISKAN company was created and has taken over ANAT’s activities. All planned
   activities were successfully executed: urban plot assessment, land plot regulation,
   and plot development, servicing, and sale. In total, 2,491 plots were developed in
   multiple sites, though only 1,090 were sold. The project demonstrated that it was
   possible to provide infrastructure services (road, water, electricity, public lighting)
   for equipped plots at an acceptable price for the population, and that there was an
   alternative to the restructuring of unsanctioned neighborhoods. It is vital, however,
   for ISKAN to carry out an assessment of its activity. This will help to determine
   the reasons for the failure to sell the plots of K-Extension (apparently due to
   inefficient marketing and plots located on aggressive soil) and avoid repeating the
   same mistakes on this type of operation in the future. The lack of adequate
   marketing of the operation concerning the 884 plots of El Mina is difficult to
   understand. ISKAN could be capable of developing its activities because it has
   access to several land developments of several courses (60 hectares in Arafat, 6
   hectares in Teyaret, and 30 hectares in Dar Naim) and in which some potential
   buyers already have land titles.




                                             35
d) Supply of Potable Water Services. This sub-component strengthened the water
   supply system in the Kebbe of El Mina and in neighborhoods that were under-
   equipped. All works programmed have been completed. Conditions of access to
   drinking water have been improved for the majority of households in those
   vulnerable districts. All works to strengthen the pumping capacity from the well
   field of the Idni aquifer have been fully completed. The production capacity has
   increased from 50,000 to 60,000 cubic meters/day. This action was accompanied
   by many operations in under-equipped neighborhoods, and it helped ensure
   sufficient water pressure via public kiosk-type standpipes (40 installed in El Mina).
   The price of water to standpipes, which is an important impact indicator, was
   91UM/cubic meter for consumption of 0 to 20 cubic meters, whereas the price of
   water provided through household connections was 99UM/cubic meter for the
   same tier (the lower price of household connections). Water costs have been
   reduced by half as compared to the project baseline (from US$2.00/cubic meter to
   US$1.00/cubic meter) and water consumption increased from 15 liter/day to 41
   liter/day. Water network targets (183 kilometers) have been exceeded as well, with
   157 kilometers installed in Mauritania, 121 kilometers in Nouakchott, and 45
   kilometers for the regional capitals. Further, rehabilitation works benefitted 88,655
   household water connections, against a target of 86,900.

e) Electricity Distribution Services. This sub-component densified and extended the
   medium voltage and low voltage networks both in the Kebba of El Mina and in the
   poorer neighborhoods. The supply of electricity to these districts caused an influx
   of requests for individual connections from 1,500 to 2,000 subscribers in El Mina.
   The conditions of access to electricity have been improved for the majority of
   households; security conditions were deemed satisfactory (due to extension of the
   public lighting network) by neighborhoods with access to widespread public
   lighting: 407 lighting posts were built in comparison to a baseline figure of 0.00
   and 327 kilometers of electric transmission and distribution lines have been
   installed (against a target of 281 kilometers). In addition, 13,850 people in the
   regional capitals have access to electricity though household connections.

f) Subprojects. These activities were included in the “Twize? program which has
   been successfully conducted by CNDHLCPI since 1999. Subsidized and non-
   subsidized public housing units developed by GRET (Groupe de Recherche et
   d’Etude Technologie) since 2003 were adapted to the restructuring operation of El
   Mina. This activity was then developed in other under-developed districts of
   Nouakchott and Nouadhibou. As of 2008, and in conformity with the project’s
   timeline, the implementation of this component generated 27,004 new clients. The
   stream of new customers has since stabilized at around 31,000 clients (for 2009,
   2010, and 2011). At the end of project implementation, there were a total of
   approximately 161,635 clients for a volume of 5.44 billion MRO loans that had
   been disbursed. The outcomes from the Activities Generating Revenue AGRs
   microcredit activities for income generation have been largely superior to the
   estimates. This is due in part to the good penetration of this type of operation
   within the Mauritanian urban dynamics and good exposure of the Twize and Beit



                                           36
   El-Mal programs within the neighborhoods targeted by UDP operations. Other
   subproject outcomes include: 4,500 public housing units built, 1,500 latrines-
   fences elements built, 34,000 microcredits granted for housing development,
   160,895 microcredits granted for income and employment-generating activities,
   1,200 professionals trained including 800 in the construction sector, and 95 micro-
   projects completed in the targeted neighborhoods.

g) Institutional Strengthening and Capacity Building. This comprised several
   subcomponents including: (i) support to municipalities; (ii) support to the central
   government; and (iii) support to community associations and the Commission
   (CNDHLCPI). In order to fulfill its role, the PCU signed 17 agreements with
   administrations, institutions, structures and organizations that were eligible for
   financial assistance that totaled US$7,854,005. The results have been satisfactory
   overall in the areas of assistance, capacity-building and the delivery of strategic
   studies, with the exception of institutional reforms that have been delayed. In
   addition to instructional strengthening work done by the PCU, there were
   numerous capacity strengthening measures namely: (i) the acquisition of office
   equipment; (ii) training provided to more than 960 staff from central governments,
   elected representatives and municipal staff, managers and agents of implementing
   agencies; (iv) financial and technical audits carried out annually within
   implementing agencies; (v) financial audits of municipalities eligible for project
   financing and regular audits on city-contracts to assess the performance of the
   municipalities and their compliance with their city contracts commitments

   Urban sector institutional capacity was strengthened through: (i) the establishment
   of simplified geographic information systems (GIS); (ii) approval of a code of
   urban planning and management; (iv) improvement and simplification of the
   existing legislative texts concerning land ownership and development; and (v)
   survey and demarcation of land parcels. These measures among others, helped to
   modernize financial management, streamline and accelerate the procedures for
   securing land, and clear up land management responsibilities. They also resulted in
   the implementation of institutional improvements such as the regulatory urban
   framework and management and the creation of tools.

Annex 3. Economic and Financial Analysis

Background

1.     An ex post economic analysis was performed for the Urban Development Project
over the lifetime of the project, i.e., the 2001-2012 periods or 11 years although an
economic analysis was not performed ex ante. Yet, it is expected that the benefits will
accrue beyond the project implementation but were not calculated.

2.      The project has 2 main components: (i) Improve living conditions and promote
employment opportunities in main urban areas; and (ii) Strengthen the institutional
framework and capacity for urban and land management. Both components had the
potential of generating health, environmental, economic and social benefits but the
quantification of the latter benefits are more difficult to perform and were not calculated.
Hence, the ex post economic analysis covered 5 sub-components under the Improving
living component, which was restructured in 2010, are as follows:
       •   Completion of Water Supply and Electricity Distribution Network
       •   Completion of Road Network
       •   Slum Upgrading
       •   Sanitation system and Shelters
       •   Microcredit

3.      Deriving the economic analysis benefits is made difficult by the complexity and
heterogeneity of the health (e.g., less water-borne diseases although vector-borne could
not be considered), environmental (less urban air emissions and water effluents, etc.),
economic (numerous benefits although job creation was not accounted for in the analysis)
and social (numerous in terms of access, quality of life, etc.) outcomes from components
improvement. Nevertheless, the benefits that were calculated includes the water
consumer service with the tariff reduction to under US$1 per cubic meter, the health
improvements due to both improved water and improved sanitation, less flooding days
due to improved drainage and finally paved road construction in urban area that led to the
increased the price of land (30% to 200%) depending on the areas. 3

4.      The selected benefits that were calculated are just a fraction of the project benefits.
In addition, they have been aggregated and compared to IDA annualized and shadowed
cost for the project over the 2002-2012 periods. Hence, it was quasi impossible to value
each component separately.

6.      The project is economically viable with a NPV discounted at 10% reaching
US$7.6 million with an ERR of 18% and a MERR of 14% and a PV B/C ratio of 1.2
(Table 1.2). No sensitivity analysis is needed as this is an ex-post evaluation with the
benefits considered accruing during the implementation of the project. Nevertheless, with
proper operations and maintenance, the benefits will keep on accruing over the next years.

Economic Analysis Benefits
Consumer Surplus Benefits

7.     The consumer surplus has been calculated for the targeted population of 181,035
in the slums of Nouakchott. The total consumer surplus amounts to US$1.1 million
annually over the period (Table 1.3).

Health Risk Reduction for the Water and Sanitation
8.      As many of the benefits of reliable and improved water supply and improved
sanitation are difficult to quantify, the economic analysis is limited to:
 − reduced incidence of diarrheal disease;
 − reduced mortality from diarrheal disease; and
 − reduced mortality from infectious diseases associated with improved nutritional
     status in young children from reduced incidence of diarrhea.

9.     The population that benefitted from improved water coverage is equivalent to
87,229 in all the targeted cities in 2005 with the targeted population reaching 106,337 in
2012. The population that benefitted from improved sanitation is equivalent to 21,799 in
2005 with the targeted population reaching 26,574 in 2012. A 50% reduction in disease
and mortality is expected from having access to improved water and a reduction of 40%
from having access to improved sanitation. 4 Benefits start accruing as of 2005 (Table 1.4).

Flood Reduction Benefits

11.     The flood reduction benefits are illustrated in Table 1.7. Project beneficiaries are
no longer affected by flooding starting in 2005. A monetization in terms of gross national
income/capita per day, of 30 days of forgone flooding by the population no longer
affected by flooding (23,305 residents), assumed to represent a share of the gained
economic activity as reported in the above mentioned evaluation report.

Impact of Road Construction on Land Value

12.     The hedonic value of the lots around the urban roads (150 meters on average from
each side of the urban roads) increased where the very conservative net incremental price
of land was estimated at US$5 per square meter. Some 26,600 linear meters were
constructed in urban areas and land prices increased by 200 percent in some cases. An
average increase of US$5 per square meter was adopted across the board based on
professional judgment. The area positively affected by the construction of houses hence
affected 7,920,000 square meter equivalent for a one-time gain of US$39.6 million.

13.    Unfortunately, the roads subcomponent was not considered as the traffic count
was not performed at the end of the project. Moreover, the electricity subcomponent was
not considered in the analysis although the evaluation reported an increase of the land
value where the electricity provision was introduced.

Annex 5. Beneficiary Survey Results

Summary of UDP’s Survey on Socio-Economic Impacts on the Kebba El Mina area
(09/2007)
Population Sample: 2,150 households

Social Impact
Organization: Under the Kebba strata (both displaced households and remaining
households), people feel that the program helped people better to organize (58%). Its
impact is more notable among the households that were moved (80.4%) than among
those that remained in place, of which only 48.7% felt the positive effects of the program
on their organization.

Social Cohesiveness:
Consider: The majority of the population in the Kebba thinks that the program had no
impact on social cohesion, though the answers are not so clear-cut. Among households
that were displaced, an overwhelming majority (62.8%) thought that the program
increased cohesion among the population, while 28.6 percent found no difference in
social cohesion.      Among households that remained, half (50.6%) thought the
restructuring of the area had no impact on social cohesion, while 27 percent thought that
cohesion was stronger.

Creation of new organizations and associations: The majority of the Kebba population
(63.5%) felt the program had no positive impact on the creation of new organizations and
associations. At the household level, 72.7 percent of Kebba households had no opinion on
this; among households that were not displaced, an even greater share (81.2%) had no
opinion. The remainder among Kebba households (19.8%) considered that the creation of
new organizations and associations was due to the efforts of local inhabitants, while a
few (7.5%) think the change was due to external interested parties.

The new organizations and associations created under the project conduct a variety of
work, focusing on social (10.6%), economic (9.7%), and political (3.5%) work. Yet a
majority of Kebba households did not understand the nature of these organizations
(75.1%) nor their function (67.7%). Among households that were not moved, these
trends are more acute (84.7% do not understand the nature of the organizations and
75.6% do not understand their function.); less so with relocated households (52.2% and
48.9%, respectively).

Economic Impact
To assess the impact of the program on economic activities and the quality of life,
analysis of household responses in the Kebba focused on issues relating to job
opportunities, the creation of associations AGR, the economic contribution of women.




                                           47
Creation of new employment opportunities: Among households interviewed, 65.8
percent felt that the program failed to create new job opportunities, with slight differences
in opinion between displaced and remaining households (65.3% and 66.0%, respectively).
Among households that thought the program had a positive impact on new job
opportunities (20.9%), displaced households had a more positive perception (29.7%) than
households that did not move (17.2%).

Income-generating activities: Similarly, 71.4 percent of households interviewed felt the
program did not have a positive impact on the creation of income-generating activities,
trade, or services.

The economic contribution of women: Household opinion was fairly even on whether
the resettlement helped women to increase their economic contribution. Where 46.7
percent of households judge there to be no impact, 42.6 percent think there was. Among
displaced households compared to those not moved, perceptions are 57.1 percent and
36.5 percent, respectively.

Other Impacts:
Attendance at schools for girls: The program impact on school attendance by girls is
one of the positive outcomes felt by targeted households. Indeed, 62.9 percent of
households interviewed consider that there is an improvement in the number of girls
going to school. This rate exceeds 70 percent for households that moved as compared to
59.4 percent for the households that remained. Nearly one-third of targeted households
(32.1%) feel there was no impact.

Housing conditions after relocation: Among displaced households, 70.7 percent believe
that housing conditions have improved, compared to 27.2 percent who believe that
housing conditions have remained the same or deteriorated. Among households that
remained, nearly 48 percent believe that housing conditions are the same or deteriorated,
as compared to 37. 7 percent who believe that conditions have improved.

Access to transport infrastructure: Among households surveyed, a majority (55.4%)
believe that the program had a positive impact on access to transport, while 43.5 percent
feel that nothing has changed. The impact is largely felt by relocated households, with
nearly 62 percent seeing a positive impact as compared to 35.7 percent who consider the
change irrelevant. Among households that did not move, the difference in opinion -
positive impact vs no impact – is 52 percent and 46.8 percent, respectively).

Contact with the outside world: Among households surveyed, about 60 percent feel
that the program has improved contacts with the outside world, as compared to 37.8
percent who disagree. The gap in perceptions about external contact is more pronounced
among displaced households (75.7% see improved contact compared to 21.8% who
disagree) than in remaining households (52.9% vs. 44.6%, respectively).

Annex 6. Summary of Borrower's ICR and/or Comments on Draft ICR


This report was drafted by the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) with the support of its
technical assistance. The Project Completion Report was based on documentation and
information provided by the various stakeholders and executing agencies involved in the
preparation and implementation of the project.

Identification and design of program

The Urban Development Program (UDP) was based on the national strategy for the
development of the urban sector. This strategy had three main objectives: (i) the control
of urban growth, (ii) the reduction of disparities in economic and social infrastructure
between urban centers, and (iii) the effective contribution of the regions, the
municipalities, the private sector and communities, in the planning and implementation of
sustainable development programs. The project aimed at improving the living conditions
in major urban centers and to harmonize urban development throughout the entire
country. The program was designed to support Central and local authorities to: (i)
improve living conditions in urban areas, particularly for low-income households; (ii)
promote economic activities and employment opportunities in major cities of Mauritania,
particularly in the poor districts of Nouakchott and Nouadhibou; and (iii) strengthen and
develop the institutional capacities (authorities and urban communities) urban land
management of urban environmental services, and decentralization. With additional
funding for the project in June 2010, the objectives of this program were revisited in the
current context. The revised goal of the program is to support the central Government and
the local authorities of Mauritania to: (i) improve access to basic services and
infrastructures in 12 urban areas; and (ii) to increase access to microfinance and activities
generating income for the population of precarious neighborhoods.

The project consisted of four components: (i) Component 1 focused on the completion of
major construction and rehabilitation of basic infrastructure in Nouakchott and the twelve
capitals of provinces capitals; (ii) Component 2 consisted of implementation of sub-
projects that included the following activities: (a) the community development of housing
construction; (b) the promotion of job creation and income-generating activities; (c) the
activities of land regulation or acquisition of land for the construction or improvement of
housing; and (d) the creation of companies and promoting home-based income generating
activities. Component 3 related to the strengthening the institutional/implementing
capacity of urban communities, NGOs, the CDHLCPI, micro-enterprises, municipalities
and central authorities in charge of urban planning and transportation, land management,
decentralization and environment, regulation, land registration, and legal system.
Component 4 concerned audits, control and monitoring systems and the operating costs
of implementing agencies.

Implementation and Results Achievements

Part A: Provision of infrastructure based in Nouakchott. This was carried out in
accordance with the credit agreement under ADU’s supervision. This component was
achieved with notable success. This included adequate implementation and completion of
the pilot operation of resettlement of Kebbe of El Mina and all programmed work:
construction of individual latrines, road paving/surfacing, and the construction of social
facilities. The upgrading of vulnerable neighborhood and development operations and
equipment of under-equipped neighborhoods which were programmed for the 2nd phase
of the program were also completed (at Riyadh, Teyaret and Dar Naim). The
construction of infrastructure to promote employment and income-generating activities,
such as the cattle market and paving the access road, development of the non-industrial
fishing zone, and the construction of the landfill, improved dirt road/street network
(using improved/stabilized dirt surfacing), were fully completed to the satisfaction of the
beneficiaries.

Part B: Supplies to the twelve regional capitals for basic infrastructure. This
component was implemented by AMEXTIPE. Programmed infrastructure works were
executed in two tranches through (i) contracts between the Government and the
concerned municipalities and (ii) according to the signing of agreements by delegated
contracting authority (MOD) between these municipalities and AMEXTIPE. Three
delegated management agreements were signed at the same time in city contracts. This
component was implemented and successfully achieved despite delays and existing
bottlenecks/limitations in the construction sector. All programmed infrastructure works
have been completed with some delay but to the satisfaction of the beneficiaries.

Part C: Slum Upgrading/Housing Site preparation in Nouakchott by SOCOGIM.
This component was implemented by ANAT (as a result of SOCOGIM‘s reform).
Subsequently the ISKAN Company was created and took over ANAT’s activities. All
planned activities were executed successfully, namely: assessment of urban plots, land
plots regulation, development and servicing and sale of plots. Several land areas were
developed and serviced and plots have been developed for sale to benefit low-income
households and middle class wage earners. On the land development of Riyadh, 635 plots
of 120 square meters each were developed and sold. Within the K-extension land area,
958 lots of 160 square meter were developed, of which 157 have been sold, thus
representing 54 percent of the total. On El-Mina Land Development Area, 898 lots were
developed and delivered in June 2011 (35% of these were sold).

Part D: Supplies of water and electricity services. This sub-component was executed
by SNDE. The strengthening of water supply systems in the Kebbe of El Mina and in
under-equipped neighborhoods was completed. All the work programmed under the first
and second phases was completed. Conditions of access to drinking water have been
improved for the majority of households in those vulnerable and under-equipped districts.
The work of strengthening the capacity of pumping in the field to increase the production,
were fully completed. The production capacity has increased from a capacity of 40 cubic




                                            50
meters/day at 60 cubic meters/day. Water costs have been reduced by half compared
with the initial baseline.
   • Supplies of electricity supply services. This sub-component was implemented
       by the SOMELEC. All the planned intensification and extension of medium
       voltage and low voltage networks were completed, both in the Kebbe of El Mina
       district and in under-equipped neighborhoods. The work of extending the network
       of public lighting in these districts was also completed. The conditions of access
       to electricity have been improved for majority of households; security conditions
       were deemed satisfactory by households with public lighting widespread in these
       areas.

Part E: Sub-Projects. The activities under this component were performed by the
CNDHLCPI which received technical assistance from an international NGO, GRET
(Groupe de Recherche et d’Etude Technologie). These activities, listed under the "Twize"
program, were implemented since 1999 and successfully conducted by the CNDHLCPI.
Investments of this sub-component were covered by an initial endowment from the
Government of $US 6 million, to which $US 4.72 million, was added, for a total grant of
$US 10.72 million, fully released by the Government. Five components are covered by
this component: (i) public housing; (ii) microcredit: (iii) creation of jobs and income-
generating activities; (iv) training and promotion of local employment; and (v)
development of micro-projects in targeted neighborhoods. The results were largely
greater than the estimated outcomes for income-generating microcredit (AGR). This was
due to the successful integration of the operation into the Mauritanian urban dynamics in
general, and optimal distribution of operators, such as Twize and Beit El Mal, in the areas
supported by the program, servicing and securing land in particular operations under the
PDU. The results were: 4,500 social habitant modules built; implementation of 1,500
latrines-fences modules; granting of 34,000 habitat microcredits and 160,895
microcredits for income and employment-generating activities; 1,200 trained
professionals including 800 in the construction sector, and 95 micro-projects in the areas
of intervention.

Part F: Strengthening institutions and capacities: the Project Implementation Unit
(PIU) was responsible for implementation of this component. It included activities such
as: (i) support to municipalities, (ii) support to the central Government’s institutions, and
(iii) support to community associations and the CDHLCPI. The PCU signed 17
agreements with each of the administrations, institutions, structures and eligible
organizations for valued at approximately $US 7,854,005. The results were satisfactory
overall in the areas of assistance, capacity-building and the establishment of strategic
studies, with the exception of the implementation of expected reforms which had some
delays, despite all the efforts of the PIU and central authorities that were involved.

Part G: Management, coordination follow-up and evaluation of the project.
Responsibility for project implementation was shared between the PCU, ADU and
AMEXTIPE. This component concerned the administration, coordination, monitoring,
evaluation and execution of the project by these three structures. In this context, the PCU
oversaw (i) the acquisition of office equipment, the purchase of office supplies and



                                             51
consumables and vehicles to meet its needs, (i) the recruitment of technical assistance and
other support depending on the needs, and (iii) the monitoring of a set of training
missions. Audit firms, technical, and financial agencies were recruited in all years of the
program, and was carried out to the satisfaction of each of the agencies.

Institutional framework for implementation: complex but operational.

All structures and executing agencies have fully played their role in accordance with the
provisions of the credit and project agreements. The program was completed in
accordance with the institutional framework in place, the provisions contained in credit
agreements, in procedures and manuals in accordance with the internal regulations of
executing agencies agreed upon and mutually agreed with the World Bank, and for some
contracts under the rules of the code of public contracts of Mauritania.

Changing national context since the entry into force of the credit agreement.

Since credit effectiveness, several changes have taken place in the Mauritanian
institutional context. In June 2003, an attempted coup undermined the institutional
stability of the country. A coup on August 5, 2005 succeeded in breaking down the
constitutional order, which was re-established in March 2007. This period was marked by
new legislative and municipal elections in October 2006 and in presidential elections in
April 2007. The Association of Mayors of Mauritania held its Congress in January 2007
and renewed the members of its governing bodies. The PDU had new local interlocutors
which appropriated the program objectives. In August 2008, Mauritania experienced a
second rupture of constitutional order and a difficult period that resulted in disruptive
consequences for program operations. The program entered a period of uncertainty, as the
Bank unilaterally put disbursements and supervision on hold. This period lasted about
fifteen months (August 2008 to October 2009), after which the project implementation
was resumed. Thanks to the commitment of the public authorities, the program
continued to work with outstanding balances of the special account and the special
accounts agencies and with interim financing drawn from the national budget for the
operations of AMEXTIPE. This resulted in increased activity and impact with a strong
ripple effect due to Government action. Furthermore, among the trends of changes over
the past three years: it should be noted that program objectives remained the same
including the priority character of the urban area.

However, these breakdowns in the constitutional order, with delays in the execution of
some works have extended the duration of the program beyond its originally-scheduled
five years. It took until May 2010 for the program to receive additional funding from IDA,
entirely devoted to the regional capitals. Several reports of closing dates for the program
have been solicited by the Government to allow execution of the program up to term and
with satisfaction.

Results and Impacts

Main results of the program

Nouakchott: ADU provided all infrastructure and equipment (component 1,
subcomponents (a) and (c)). In addition, (i) the SNDE and SOMELEC satisfactorily
provided water supply and electricity infrastructure, in addition to additional works in
vulnerable and under-equipped neighborhood (component 1, subcomponent (e)); (ii)
ANAT and ISKAN successfully conducted land servicing and subsequent sales at a cost
accessible to low-income households (component 1, subcomponent (b)), (iii) CNDHLCPI
and implemented micro-projects and microfinance (Component 2). The results of
technical support by MHUAT and GRET exceeded expectations in restructured
precarious neighborhoods and un- and under-equipped areas.

Regional capitals: Provision of facilities in the regional capitals (component 1,
subcomponent (d)) was satisfactory. Infrastructure works under the additional financing
was completed, before the closing date..

Training and capacity-building measures: All the commitments under the agreements
signed between the CPC and each of the institutions and beneficiary associations have
been honored, including the provision of office equipment, acquisition and availability of
rolling stock and training of more than 950 executives and agents in the areas of their
respective competencies.

The results show that all eight (8) performance indicators required to trigger Phase 2 of
the program have been met. The point on which efforts must continue are land issues and
the improvement and consolidation of the resources of urban communities. The
Mauritanian authorities are focused on the positive results of recorded performances,
while seeking a future program with a view to consolidate and strengthen the actions of
the PDU, balanced by support for development, appropriation, and implementation of
reforms by the central administrations and local beneficiaries.

Economic and Financial evaluation

On August 31, 2012, total disbursements of SDR 55,246,855,82 on a budget of SDR
55,800,000 registered in the credit agreement. The rate of disbursement was 99 percent.
This level of disbursement is considered very satisfactory and it accelerated during the
last two months of the program. With regard to the "micro-projects" component, the total
amount of the subsidy paid by the State was of $US 10,720,000. This disbursed amount
represents 178.67 percent of the commitment of the Government in the credit agreement.
The technical assistance of the GRET under this component was funded by the program
for a total disbursed amount of $US 2,101,647. The total amount disbursed for this
component was US$12,821,467 or 83.61 percent on the national budget for investments.
When adding additional funding, the amount of disbursements as of August 31, 2012,
amounted to US$19,628,448 on a budget of $US25,500,000 recorded in the credit
agreement. The disbursement rate of 77 percent, is considered acceptable prior to the



                                           53
closure of the program. With regard to GIRM’s contribution, the total amount mobilized
on August 31, 2012 is MRO 9,435,584,472, or US$ 32,536,498. The disbursed amount
MRO 8,334,225,267 is the equivalent of US$ 28,738,707 representing a disbursement
rate of 88 percent. In addition to this disbursed amount, a total amount of MRO 483
million must be added for parties financing activities of Component 1 (b) by
SOCOGIM/ANAT/ISKAN and those of Component 1 (e) (SNDE and SOMELEC)
taken the funds of these companies in amounts that were on-lent to them according the
subsidiary agreements. In conclusion, and to the credit of the Mauritanian authorities, the
implementation of the program did not suffer payment delays thanks to the Government’s
funding in general, even during periods of uncertainty that affected Mauritania from 2003
to 2009.

Performance in monitoring and coordination of the Program
The Inter-ministerial Monitoring Committee (CIS) placed under the chairmanship of the
Prime Minister, has ensured the smooth running of the program by taking smart decisions
with regard to the multiple actions of the program covering several sectors of
development. Through this Committee, the period of uncertainty that Mauritania has
crossed had little impact on the broad guidelines of the program. This mobilization of the
Government at the highest level shows attention and special interest given to the effective
implementation of the PDU.

The Technical Committee has been highly effective in the preparation of dossiers
submitted to the decision of the CIS. Because of the composition of its members, the
Technical Committee has enabled the Program to immerse itself in the beneficiary
administrations and also facilitate the implementation of specific agreements between the
PCU (Project Coordinating Unit), central Governments, and focal points. This capability
also enabled the PCU to have managers that can be heard on various issues of the
implementation of the program.

The coordination and management of the program were based essentially on a small
component of the PCU team. This core team has the advantage of having its lead as
Coordinator, a high-level manager with experience managing projects supported by
bilateral and multilateral financial partners, and with a deep knowledge of the inner
workings of the Mauritanian administration and the exceptional qualities. All partners
involved have praised the quality of coordination and good relationships that they have
maintained with them during the whole period of implementation of the Program. The
PCU has also played an important role in the coordination and harmonization of actions
with other programs including PDCD/KfW, PRECASP/BM, PERICLES/EU, defeat/AFD,
AFD/PERCUN and UNDP/PACA.

This core group has been able to harmonize and work in synergy with all other actors
involved in program implementation, satisfying its obligations in both coordination and
execution of certain program components. This team, although it is small, was able to
capitalize on all the achievements of the program, team returning to the PCU with the
agreement of the Government and the World Bank, and ensuring publication of results




                                            54
and dissemination of gains from the completed work at the close of this phase of the
program.

Performance in the management of the program
At the start of the program, a Special Account was opened as well as some secondary
special accounts at the level of the implementing agencies. Despite the provisions
established in the credit agreement and subsidiary agreements, fiduciary risks were high.
Furthermore, seventeen (17) categories of expenditure were created and errors of
imputations were also high. The Coordinator, CEOs, and CFOs have received training on
financial and accounting management that have been very useful and have produced
positive effects on financial and accounting of the program management.

All contractual obligations have been met, including the prescribed financial audits
regularly carried out in accordance with the standards prescribed and certified. They are
transmitted to the overseeing Ministry guardianship (MAED) and the World Bank, most
of the time well before the deadline. Audit officers have regularly certified program
accounts. The recommendations of audits and notes were taken into account. At the end
of supervision missions of financial management controls organized by the World Bank,
administrative, financial and accounting program management was reviewed and
considered to be satisfactory. The credit agreement has been amended several times in
order to facilitate and improve financial and accounting management. The latest
amendment was in 2009, and it has prescribed the closure of several special sub-accounts
at the level of agencies. Only the special account managed by the PCU remained
operational. Activities were virtually completed at level agencies except for AMEXTIPE,
which ran the program including activities under the additional financing. The PCU
continued the finalization of the activities under the institutional component and the
overall coordination of activities. As a result, the program fiduciary risk was low (by the
end of the program), pursuant to the conclusions of the audits after the official closing of
the special account and the account of the local counterpart.

Procurement Performance
All procurement plans established by executing agencies and consolidated by the PCU
were submitted to the World Bank, which has validated them. Coordinator, Directors-
General and heads of procurement markets have received specific training on the
procurement and which were very helpful. These formations have produced positive
effects on the quality of contracting documents and control of procurement procedures.
The Government and the World Bank often made positive opinions on the procurement
supervision missions. The overall performance of the program is judged on this plan as
satisfactory.

Performance of the institutions, consultants and contracting enterprises
The implementation of the program has promoted the emergence of research and
individual consultants in the market especially in the construction sector, in the areas of
building capacity in general and in the implementation of city contracts. Furthermore, the
intervention of accredited international consultancy, in joint ventures or other forms of
collaboration with national consultants, produced effects of transfer of knowledge and/or



                                            55
sharing of experience and know-how for the benefit of Mauritania. In addition, the
monitoring and control aspects insure that associated and partner offices have acquired
experiences that will be valued in the next phase. Although companies have faced
bottlenecks in the construction sector, especially during the years 2004-2007, they have
managed to deliver quality goods and services for most works. Despite a difficult
environment and delays, recipients were satisfied with the completed works. The
implementing agencies were audited throughout the implementation of the program. The
conclusions of the reports raised the good performance of all these agencies and noted
deficiencies have been overcome to the satisfaction of the Government and the World
Bank. Municipalities, the Association of Mayors of Mauritania, the Nouakchott urban
community, and central governments also have benefitted from the program.

Impacts of the program
The project was considered highly satisfactory for performance in operations to improve
living conditions in poor neighborhoods. The program produced quantitative benefits but
also qualitative and sustainable benefits in terms of social progress, with the feeling and
the pride of recipients to 'be at home' and of belonging to a nation, and the high degree of
commitment from the Government, local communities and support of the program by the
beneficiary communities. Ultimately, the program offered citizens the means to invest in
important decisions that were taken at the local level through the adaptation of
institutional frameworks and intervention of associations and community-based
organizations.

Appreciation of the World Bank role and actions
The diligence with which the World Bank has honored its commitments has been very
appreciated in general. The World Bank team fulfilled its roles promptly and as expected.

Assessment of Government’s Performance
The Mauritanian authorities have honored all the commitments entered into by credit
agreements. All these commitments led to the achievement of the performance indicators
supporting the initiation of Phase 2 of the PDU or the preparation of a new program.

Sustainability and risk
The credit agreement has highlighted certain risks identified during the evaluation of the
PDU, relating to execution of program components and those related to the management
and installation of the program. Examination of these various risks, on the occasion of the
drafting of this completion report, shows that these risks have been adequately mitigated.
It notes, however, that the reforms proposed, although not a major risk, are slow to be
implemented and the significance of their impact and effectiveness can be assessed only
as part of a future program. With regard to the sustainability of program achievements,
the Government is concerned that sustainable forms of structures be implemented. The
MHUAT is one of the key departments responsible for the appropriation of achievements
especially in the areas of habitat, urbanization, land reforms and control of public work.
The creation of ISKAN, the ADU and the AMEXTIPE, BEM in the process of
institutionalization, CDD (Caisse de dépôt et development), are all instruments at the
disposal of the Mauritanian government and authorities already involved in



                                            56
implementation of government action for the sustainable relief from poverty through
mechanisms established and developed as part of the PDU.

The recurrent funding of investments should not in principle be a major problem. Sound
management and exploitation of market infrastructure will generate new resources for the
municipalities and should determine which part will be devoted to the maintenance of the
infrastructure. Facilities for the supply of water and electricity are provided by SNDE and
SOMELEC that provide paid services to the user. Regarding school and educational
infrastructure, their maintenance is a triangular participatory management involving the
municipality, branch institutions and parents’ associations. Health infrastructure will rely
on participatory management involving the municipality and health officials. Furthermore,
the mayors for beneficiaries of infrastructure and equipment are attentive and sensitized
to their good management and their maintenance in order to extend the life of
infrastructure and to ensure a good level of municipal public services for the populations.
It should be noted that city contracts which were systematized during implementation of
the program, are to be considered a tool of local governance, whose implementation has
been useful in the municipalities and the beneficiaries do include technical assistance and
support provided by the program.

Conclusions and Recommendations
The program has achieved significant results and performance indicators that trigger
Phase 2 of the program.

As a result of project achievements, we note that: (i) the Government and the
municipalities are engaged irreversibly in restructuring the existing precarious
neighborhoods and preventing the formation of new precarious neighborhoods through
progressive provision of land in conformity with the legal framework and procedures for
the distribution of land titles and access to the property by preventing land speculation.
These actions have been initiated and implemented over the past three years under the
guidance of the MHUAT, ISKAN and ADU among structures of implementation; (ii)
microcredits were granted to the poor for public housing, and strengthening their capacity
for operation and maintenance. The sustainability of this activity of microfinance and
microcredit for housing is a main concern for concerned for the MHUAT and its
structures through ISKAN’s involvement, CSD, and the institutionalization of the BEM;
(iii) NGOs participate actively in organization of the communities, and technical
assistance and products for the poor are being developed. This action is appreciated
through the achievements of the BEM, with the assistance of the GRET; (iv) the legal
framework is being revised and the Government has implemented actions of
strengthening the process of decentralization and communities are involved and
empowered. Central Government and local authorities are strengthened in a sustainable
manner and are competent in the areas of land management, registration of land titles has
improved, and the number of registered land titles has increased.

With respect to recommendations, it is proposed: (i) to continue and achieve reforms of
the Regional Development Fund (FRD), as well as reform of local taxation, in order to
increase the resources transferred in line with local skills and assets transfer; (ii) to keep



                                             57
in the Council of Ministers informed in order to maintain the same level of information
for all members of the Government about the progress made under the program, and to
seek at the same time a Government decision for the implementation of the reforms that
were put on hold; (iii) Ownership by municipalities to be confirmed at the end of the
agreements of delegated management, to agencies of execution, formally the agreement’s
termination and the confirmation that works have been carried out in accordance with the
rules of art and received by the municipality without reservation; (iv) to transform the
PCB into an autonomous, operational and sustainable structure, to install and implement
the Government program to capitalize and value experience, to accumulate expertise in
editing, performance and program management, and to establish within the
institutionalized PCU a documentation center dedicated to the protection, backup,
importance and the quality of the documentation produced and to facilitate access by the
public and the community of researchers and consultants.

Finally, it is proposed to initiate preparation of a new program as ambitious as the PDU
as part of a dynamic continuity and in synergy with the macroeconomic framework, the
conclusions of the evaluation of the PRSP, and the major pillars of the SAP/WB.
