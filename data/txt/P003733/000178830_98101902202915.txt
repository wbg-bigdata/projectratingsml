INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENI' TO
THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON A PROPOSED DEVELOP4ENT
CREDIT TO THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA FOR A
THIRD HIGHWAYS PROJECT
1.          I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
development credit to the Republic of Indonesia for the equivalent of
US$14.0 million on standard IDA terms to help finance a Third Highways
Project.
PART I - THE ECONOMIY
2.          The latest Bank report on Indonesia, (Development Issues for
Indonesia, December 1, 1972: R73-6/1) contains a discussion of recent
economic developments, but addresses itself principally to longer-term policy
issues relevant to the Second Plan (197b-78) now in preparation.    Country
data are presented in Annex I.
3.          Indonesia's economic progress over the five years ending 1971
has been satisfactory.    The rate of growth of GDP, averaging 5 percent per
year in 1965-70, reached 6-7 percent in 1971, but was probably lower in 1972
when food production, particularly rice, was severely affected by drought.
Rice imports to meet the shortages in 1972/73 are estimated at 1.2 million
tons, up from 530,000 tons in the preceding year.    Mainly as a result of
these shortages the cost of living indexes escalated towards the end of 1972
so that prices at the end of December were 26 percent higher than a year
previously, interrupting the relative price stability achieved and maintained
since 1969.   However, secondary price effects have so far been limited and
it appears that the prices are beginning to decline.
4.          In the industrial sector, there has been further substantial growth
in the production of textiles as well as of other consumer and industrial
goods. The rehabilitation and expansion of domestic enterprises, backed by
a continuing inflow of private investment and commitments of official aid for
several major industrial projects, suggests that the prospects are good for
further industrial growth from the present small base.    Infrastructure
rehabilitation and expansion is underway, financed in large measure by project
aid, including IDA credits.   Deficiencies in the transport, power and
telecommunications sectors, however, could become a constraint on agricultural
and industrial growth unless special efforts are made to accelerate the
implementation on ongoing and future projects.



- 2 -
5.        In the public sector, Government revenues in 1971/72 were 20
percent higher than in the previous year.    A much larger increase, in the
order of 45 percent, will be realized in 1972/73. The largest item in this
increase would be taxes on expected higher earnings of foreign oil companies.
Other revenues could increase by up to 20 percent.    The expected increase
in revenues of Rp 160 billion (US$387 million) after financing increases in
salaries and material expenditure in the routine budget, would allow for a
doubling (to Rp 135 billion or US$326 million) of the surplus available
for the development budget.   Together with counterpart funds generated by
program aid (estimated at Rp 97 billion or US$234 million) this provides for
a development budget in 1972/73 of Rp 232 billion (US$560 million), which
is 48 percent more than in 1971/72.
6.        The balance of payments situation has improved steadily.    Exports,
led by oil, have expanded at an unprecedented rate in recent years, but
imports have also risen rapidly.    Recorded exports from Indonesia rose by
over 30 percent in the last two years, and they increased even more in
1972/73, reaching about US$1,935 million, largely as a result of sharp
increases in the volume and value of oil and timber exports.    Foreign
exchange reserves, usually negative on a net basis, increased rapidly in 1972
and reached a net level of $285 million at the end of December 1972.    Gross
reserves then amounted to $489 million, equivalent to about three months of
total imports at 1972/73 rates and an increase of $345 million in the year.
The change was caused by increased capital inflows including growth in the
amounts of private capital attracted by high Indonesian interest rates, in
the utilization of foreign loans by state enterprises, and in direct
foreign investment.
7.        The Government is now in the process of assessing Indonesia's past
performance and future economic potential as part of its projections for the
Second Plan.   This Plan will address more directly than was possible in the
rehabilitation phase the issues of employment, income distribution and regional
development.   Although the ability of the Indonesian Government to formulate
and implement plans, programs and projects has improved, limited managerial
capacity presents a serious obstacle to more rapid growth.    This problem as
well as the continued need to improve the mobilization of domestic savings,
will also have to be considered in the formulation of the Plan.
8.        Bank Group assistance to Indonesia is a part of the international
support being given in increasing amounts through the IGGI.    Aid commitments
have risen from less than US$200 million equivalent in 1967 to over US$600
million for 1971/72.    The proportion of project aid has steadily increased
over this period, but substantial program aid remains essential as support
for the balance of payments and - in spite of strong domestic revenue
efforts - as a source of additional funds for the development budget.    For
1972/73, express or implied commitments made by IGGI members amounted to some
US$724 million equivalent, of which US$320 million was for program aid,
including US$110 million in food supplies.    In December 1972, the IGGI met
to consider a request for $760 million in new commitments of project and program



-3-
aid in 1973/74, and accepted this as reasonable and realistic in terms of
Indonesia's needs.
9.        The soft average terms of foreign assistance in the IGGI framework,
and the rescheduling of pre-1966 external debt obligations (under the 1970
Paris Club agreement with the Western countries and Japan and parallel
arrangements with several Eastern European countries) have kept Indonesia's
public debt service ratio relatively low, currently at about 11 percent of
exports.   The capacity to service external debt will, however, continue to
be limited by the size of investment income transfers arising from foreign
investment in oil, hard minerals, forestry and manufacturing which amounted
to 14 percent of exports in 1972 and will increase substantially through the
1970's.   The maintenance of low official debt service ratios during the
decade will depend on the continued availability of concessional aid, restraints
on short and medium term foreign borrowing not directly related to export growth,
and the further substantial increases in exports which are now projected.
PART II - BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN
INDONESIA
10.       In order to accelerate the pace of economic development, Indonesia
will require substantial external support for rehabilitation and improvement
of infrastructure and expansion of production capabilities in agriculture,
minerals, forestry and manufacturing.   It will also require continued
strengthening of the institutions for the planning of development and the
management of the economy.   Welfare and income distribution, including
family planning, as well as regional development and related patterns of
employment and population movements, also need to be given an important
place in Indonesia's development strategy.
11.       The work of both the Resident Staff in Indonesia and at Headquarters
and the lending activities of the Bank Group have been oriented towards these
development objectives.   The focus of the Bank's economic work in providing
assistance to the Government in the current preparation of Indonesia's next
five-year plan is also along these lines.
12.       Consistent with Indonesia's low per capita income, large external
resource requirements and difficult balance of payments problems, the Bank
Group's lending to Indonesia (aside from IFC investments) has been and will
probably continue in the foreseeable future to be in the form of IDA credits.
In recognition of the urgent need for institutional reforms, most IDA-financed
projects have been associated with major reorganizations of existing
institutions or the establishment of new ones, and most credits have included
appropriate provision for consultant services.



13.       To date, Indonesia has received 26 IDA credits amounting to
US$341.5 million.   Annex TT contains a summary statement of IDA credits
and IFC investments as oflFebruary 28, 1973 and notes on the execution of
on-going projects.   The compx)sition of this lending reflects the priorities
for rehabilitation and development established by the Government.    Transport
is amnong those sectors given highest priority by Indonesia's First Five-Year
Flan (1969-1974).   In this sector, the Association has already extended two
credits for highway rehabilitation, maintenance and construction and one
for rehabilitation of the inter-island shipping fleet.
14.       In order to assist the rehabilitation and development of the
agricultural sector, credits have been extended for the Government estates
sector, irrigation systems, a seed multiplication program, fisheries,
livestock, smallholder rubber production and the FUS1JSI fertilizer plant.
Other priority sectors to which credits have also been extended include power,
telecommunications, industry, education and population.    In addition, three
technical assistance credi-ts have been made to financ.e pre-investment studies
undertaken by -the Government, which have helped to establish investment
priorities over a wide range of activities, and other urgently needed
technical assistance.   Credits to finance projects for smallholder and private
estates tea development, sugar industry rehabilitation, a thermal power
station, an industrial estate and education are expected to be presented to
the Lxecutive Directors in the next several months.    Projects in irrigation,
telecommuniications  and railways are under preparation.
1*.       The firs-t IDA credit to Indonesia was made in September 1968, and
19 o, thle 26 credits have been made since July 1970.   The program is thus
new, wnd the undisbursed portion of the credits is therefore relatively large.
Virtually every credit has been associated with extensive institutional
reforms involving, inter alia, the creation of new project authorities,
drafting of new charters, and enactment of new legislation, all of which have
taken, in most cases, much *time.   Several credits - including the firs-t two
for agricultural estates projects - have experienced delays in disbursement
becauise of management problems (Annex II).
16.       Both because of the limited absorption capacity of project agencies
and the need in the initial stages of lending to Indonesia to assist in a
numnber of sectors, IDA lending was spread over a relatively large number of
fairly small projects.    Now that the program has substantially expanded, our
assistance will concentrate on consolidating what has already been started
through a smaller number of larger loans to project entities already familiar
with Bank Group procedures.    This consolidation is expected to reduce the
Government's needs to staff new or substantially reorganized project agencies
and to make more manageable the Bank's responsibility for supervising projects
in Indonesia.

PART III - THE TRANSPORT SECTOR
17.       Indonesia is an archipelago of more than 3,000 islands
stretching 5,000 km along the equator.    The land area, 70 percent of
which consists of the four major islands of Java, Sumatra, Kalimantan and
Sulawesi, is about 1.9 million km .    (see Map).
18.        The Indonesian transport system comprises marine services which
link the islands, and highways and railways which provide the inland transport
facilities on the islands.   Land transport is well developed in Java with
an extensive railway and highway network while in Sumatra railways have been
developed only in some parts, and the road network is limited to basic
links between principal cities.   On the other islands, except for Madura,
no railways exist and in many cases the road system is limited to areas
around towns and ports.   The air transport volume is still small, but has
increased rapidly in the last few years.    Most transport facilities have
been neglected and require rehabilitation, betterment or sometimes complete
reconstruction.
19.        The current Five-Year Development Plan (1969-7h) includes a Rp
200 billion (US$483 million) investment target for transport.    The Plan
has been used as a rough framework for investment because needs and priorities
were unclear in its early years.    Investment, which was low during the
Plan's early years is now rapidly increasing for all modes and for roads it
may reach as much as Rp 100 billion (US$242 million) during the current Plan
period.   During the Indonesian fiscal year 1973/74, Rp 24 billion (US$58
million) is included in the Central Government's Development Program for
the Rupiah component of road rehabilitation and construction.    This amount
represents 15 percent of the total Developmenu Program for 1973/74.
20.       The Indonesian State Railways (PNKA), comprises about 6,200 km
of 1.067 n gauge and 600 km of narrow gauge track; nearly all is in need
of rehabilitation.   There is a 5,000 km system on Java, four separate
systems on Sumatra and one line on Madura.   Motive power consists of roughly
850 steam and 300 diesel locomotives - the utilization factor of which is
low due to age and lack of spare parts.    In November 1972, a Bank mission
evaluated the viability and needs of PNKA and concluded that railway
transport will continue to perform an important function especially in a
densely populated area such as Java.    A forthcoming railway appraisal
mission will review the railways investment requirements and technical
assistance needs.
21,       Indonesia is heavily dependent on inter-island shipping for internal
ccmmunications and on ocean shipping for its imports and exports.    Only 20
of the country's 300 ports have facilities to serve ships of over 500 tons
at quayside.   A series of studies on short-term port requirements have been
completed umnder assistance from the Netherlands.   It concluded that port
capacities are generally adequate but extensive dredging and rehabilitation
are required.   Some rehabilitation work is now underway, assisted by the ADB,
the Netherlands and Japan.   Studies on long range port requirements are due
to commence soon.   The inter-island shipping fleet has considerable excess
capacity which has affected the financial viability of shipping companies and
their capability to maintain vessels.    The repair and re-equipment of part
of the inter-island fleet and shipyards is being financed by an IDA credit



- 6 -
made in June 1972.   A long term study to deteimine inter-island shipping
needs is being financed by the Netherlands.
22.       Air transport uses Indonesia's two international airports and 36
domestic airports and is growing rapidly.    USAID financed a study to
determine the site of a new airport; it concluded that an entirely new
airport will be required by about 1980.    Several of the domestic airports
are being used by commercial jet aircraft but ground facilities are
-Ladequate and they are normal:Ly open only during daylight hours which
contribu es to under utilization of domestic aircraft.
23.       Proposals for highway construction originate from the Directorate-
General of Highways (DGH) in the Ministry of Public Works and Power, Etnd
for other modes, from the Directorates-Genei^al of Sea Communications,
Aviation and Land Transport in the Ministry of Communications. The project
proposals are reviewed by planning bureaus of these ministries and subsequently
by the Communications and Infrastructure Division of the National Plarning
Council (BAPPENAS), which is responsible for determining the total investment
budget for the sector; foreign experts from the UNDP-financed Transport
Coordination Advisory Services (TCAS), for which the Bank is executing agency,
are being used to assist in the preparation and evaluation of investment
proposals.
2L.       The rational de -armination of investment priorities in the transport
sector is hampered by a lack of qualified Indonesian staff and a shortage of
data, espedally on past performance, transport costs and existing and
future sources of traffic.    In addition to assisting the National Planning
Council in its task of transport investment planning, the TCAS team also
advises on policy matters and problems of data collection.    TCAS started work
about three years ago and now consists of seven experts.    The Government and
the Bank are addressing themselves to the question of the team's future role
in the context of the Government's needs for technical assistance in the
transport planning field.
25.       In recent years, the Government, assisted by the Bank Group, has
made a major effoft to improve road transport.    The Bank was executing
agency for a UNDP study undertaken between 1968 and 1970.    This study has
provided the basis for the two previcus highway projects financed by IDA.
The first credit approved in FY69 was mainly for highway maintenance and
rehabilitation and organizational improvernents; the second, in FY71, for
construction of 200 km of main highway in southern Sumatra.    The project
now proposed was also identified during the course of the above mentioned
study and the detailed engineering, carried out by consultants, was financed
from an IDA technical assistance credit (216-IND).    A recent Bank highway
mission found few high-priority new road construction projects outside Java and
proposed more emphasis in the future on low cost, labor-intensive road
betterment work.   Such improvement projects are being identified and prepared
for possible financing by the Bank Group.    There is also a need for
expansion of rural feeder roads which are presently being met in part lmder
the Government's Rural Works (Kabupaten) program, for which Bank Group
assistance is being considered.   Consideration will also be given to road
construction projects in Sumatra and possibly other areas where traffic levels
are likely to be sufficiently great to justify the higher standards involved.



PART IV - THE PROJECT
Background:
26.         The Amurang-Kapitu-Inobonto-Kotanobagu-Duloduo highway, located
in North Sulawesi Province, forms part of the main coastal route between
Menado (the capital of the province) and a rice-producing area under
development in the Dumoga Valley.   The two highway sections to be
constructed as part of the proposed project lie on the narrow coastal plain
between Kapitu and Inobonto and in the Dumoga Valley; they are unpaved and
in very poor condition.   One section is exceptionally difficult to negotiate
in the rainy season, and the other is impassable for about four months
each year.   The highway linking the two sections (Inobonto-Kotanobagu) is
already paved and capable of carrying anticipated traffic until the mid-1980's
before improvement is needed.    The proposed project is important to the
agricultural development of North Sulawesi and reflects the growing emphasis
which the government is giving to the regional balance of Indonesia's
development.   The two highway sections to be constructed will help in
linking Menado and the main ocean-going export port in the area, Bitung, to
their hinterland in the cen ter of the province.
27.         The highway sections to be constructed were identified, and
feasibility studies by Kampsax/Berger (Denmark/US) were carried out, under
UNDP-financed 1968-70 Highway Services for which the Association was the
Executing Agency.   The detailed engineering, undertaken by Vallentine, Laurie
and Davies (Australia), was financed through Technical Assistance Credit 216-IND.
The training of highway maintenance personnel included in the proposed project
represents a continuation of the training initiated under the Second Highways
Project, Credit 154-IND, scheduled for completion by December 31, 1973.   The
proposed project was appraised in October 1972.    Negotiations were held in
Washington from April 2-4, 1973.
The Project:
28.         The proposed project comprises:
a) construction of two highway sections totalling 124 km to
two-lane paved standards and two bridges between Amurang
and Duloduo in Sulawesi;
b) feasibility study of approximately 300 km of highway between
Bandung and Cilacap in Java and 250 km of related feeder
roads, and subsequent detailed engineering if justified;
c)  technical assistance to the Directorate General of Highways
(DGH) to prepare a program for the betterment of existing
low-standard highways throughout Indonesia;
d) training of highway maintenance personnel.
The principal features of the proposed credit and project are summarized in
Annex III.



29.         The highway construction in North Sulawesi is part of the
Government's strategy to opezn up new agricultural lands in the Outer Islands.
The feasibility study - to explore the need, and suggest ways to improve the
capacity of the Bandung-Cilacap highway and related feeder roads - reflects
highway construction plans to link island interiors to marine transport
facilities and to anticipate increasing traffic in the densely-populated
islands.   Technical assistanice for the betterment program responds to the
increased emphasis to be placed on this approach.   Finally, the trzining of
highw7ay maintenance personnel serves the Government's increasing commitment
to an adequate program of highway maintenance and betterment following the
many years of neglect and deterioration of the highway system.
30.         The DGH will execute the project, with the assistance of consultants
to be financed under the proposed credit.
Project Costs:
31.         Total project costs are estimated at about US$19.0 million
equivalent, of which US$14 million would be in foreign exchange.   The
proposed IDA credit of US$14 million will finance the estimated foreign exchange
costs of the project equivalent to about 74 percent of total project costs.
The Government will finance the balance, amounting to US$5 million, as part of
the annual development budget for DGH.   Details on the costs of the project
components are shown below:

Disbursement:
32.         Credit funds will be disbursed on the basis of 65 percent of the
cost of highway construction (the estimated foreign exchange component) and
the actual foreign exchange cost of consultants' services (estimated at 85
percent).   Disbursements for the project are scheduled to begin during the
fourth quarter of 1973 and terTinxate on June 30, 1977.



-9-
33.         The highway construction contracts will be placed after
international competitive bidding.   Bids will be required on each
highway section seperately,but suitably prequalified contractors will be
permitted to undertake both.   A few local contractors have been prequalified
on their own or in joint venture with foreign firms and others are expected
to participate as sub-contractors.
Standards:
34.         Both highway sections, which have been designed to suitable DGH
standards related to the expected traffic volumes, are located in farming
areas where population densities are low and unemployment minimal.   The
work force required for normal equipment usage operation (about 500 men) will
absorb most of the suitable available labor in the areas.   Labor-intensive
construction methods would require the transfer of labor from Java (over
2,000 km away).   The Government does not consider such a transfer acceptable
for the short-term scattered and seasonal work opportunities offered by highway
construction.   In particular, the heavy dry season labor demands of the
highway would conflict with farming operations.   Also, as the type of
construction and quality of work require lend themselves better to normal
equipment-usage construction methods, the Government decided not to use
labor-intensive methods of construction.
Project Benefits:
35.         The Kapitu-Inobonto Section runs close to the coast and serves an
area mainly engaged in copra production.   The copra is exported via Bitung
despite the present deplorable highway conditions.   Rehabilitation of
plantations in the area is now underway and while the fall in transport costs
associated with the highway improvement should mean better farm prices for
copra producers, there is insufficient information to estimate what the
impact might be.   Accordingly, the quantifiable economic benefits from improving
this highway section have been limited to measurable savings in vehicle
operating costs and highway maintenance.   Traffic, which is expected to be
about 300 vehicles per day in the opening year of the new highway, consists of
both local movements and traffic destined for Menado and Bitung from Kotamobagu
and Duloduo.   The possibility of improving the alternative route shown on the
map from Kapitu to Kotamobagu was considered, but the costs of construction
in the difficult mountain terrain through which the route passes exceed the
benefits in vehicle operating costs.   The benefits from the section proposed
for construction yield a return of 13 percent.   The estimates of benefits
underlying these return calculations do not include important, though
unquantifiable, improvements in local administrative and social integration
which year round access to the project area would induce.



- 1C) -
36.         Without the Kotamobagu-Duloduo section, access to the Dumoga
area will be only for eight months per year, at high transport costs and
growing road maintenance efforts.   Improvement of the highway will
provide access all year round.   About one-third (15,000 tons of dry stalk
paddy) of the marketable rice output from an irrigation project now uader
construction, could be attributed to this improvement in accessibility to
markets.   Based on the value added of the increment in rice production, the
transport cost savings for normal traffic growth, and savings in the cost
of maintaining the poor existing highway as traffic increases construction
of Kotamobagu-Duloduo section is expected to yield a return of 13 peroent also.
PART V - LEGAL INSTRUMTSEN   AND
AUTHORITY
37.         The draft Development Credit Agreement between the RepubLic of
Indonesia and the Association, the Recommendation of the Committee provided
for in Article V, Section 1 (d) of the Articles of Agreement of the A3sociation,
and the text of a resolution approving the proposed credit are being
distributed to the Executive Directors separately.   The draft Agreement
conforms to the normal pattern for credits for highway projects.
38.         I am satisfied that the proposed development credit would comply
with the! Articles of Agreement of the Association.
PART VI - RECaOMENDATION
39.         I recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed
Development Credit.

C.           PROJECTS IN EXECUTIONF
Cr. No. 127  Irrigation Rehabilitation:   US$5.o Million Credit of Septemer 6,
l9  ;  Closing Date: June 30   1974.-
This US$5.0o million credit was the first for irrigation rehabilitation
in Tndonesia. It covers 201,000 ha. All the equipment supplied under the Credit
is being well utilized and disbursements are 98 percent of estimates made at the
t-ine of appraisal. 'The bulk of the cost of the project is being borne tby GOI.
Final completion of the project is expected to be delayed by about two years in
order to complete much needed drainage work, which was not included in the original
schedule. The economic rate of return (ERR), which was calculated as 50 percent at
appraisal, has been re-worked to allow for actual schedule and costs; it is 25
percent.
Cr. No. 135 Technical Assistance; US$2.0 Million Credit of December 27, 1968;
Closing Date:  January 31, 1974.
The preinvestment studies financed by this credit are progressing
satisfactorily and the! credit is nearly fully committed. In order to complete
disbursements for ongoing studies; we have recently agreed to postpone the closing
date    for one year, to January 31, 1974.
Cr. No. 154  Highwsays; US$28 Million Credit of June 20, 1969; Closing Date:
December 31, 1973.
This credit finances equipment for highway maintenance and a specific
highway rehabilitation program. Initial delays in project execution arose from
the unfamiliarity of the Indonesian officials with Bank procurement procedures
and administrative inefficiencies in disbursement of local funds. The project
is now progressingS satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 155 Agricultural Estates; US$16 Million Credit of June 20, 1969;
Clos2rg Date:  June 30 
This project is about one year behind its original schedule due to
delay in appointing management advisors and visiting inspectors. The project
also suffers from weak management and inadequate Government control of the estates
irvolved.  The Government is reviewing the findings of a management surve.y report
(financed under Credit No. 216) covering all Government agricultural estates,
and as a first step, is introducing improved systems of management contrcl and
cost accounting on the estates. The Government is discussing with the Association
further steps necessary to improve the management of the estates.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them. They
shaould be read in this sense, and with the underatanding that they do not
purport to present a balanced evaluation of strenrths and weaknesses in
project execution.

Cr. No. 165   M, ectricity Distribution:  US$15 Million Credit of October 29,
1969;  Closing Date:  December 31, 1973.
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 193   PUSII Fertilizer Expansion:  US$30 Million Credit of June 15,
1970;  Closing Date:  December 31, 1975
Implementation of this project began nearly a year later than anti-
cipated in the appraisal report because of the time required to meet all the
conditions of effectiveness, to select contractors on bid specifications accep-
table to all co-lenders, and to negotiate contracts satisfactory to all parties.
Since the conclusion of the contracts, Fart I (construction of an ammonia-urea
fertilizer complex with an annual capacity of 380,000 metric tons of urea) has
progressed well and the contractors, spurred on by a penalty-bonus arrangement,
are now ahead of the new schedule. Part II (construction and installation of a
natural gas gathering system and a 65-mile transmission line to the fertilizer
complex for use as feedstock and fuel and to serve other industrial users) has
als;o suLPfered delays, but the construction contract has beer. awarded and the
systen, is noLw expected to be completed by February 1974, when the fertilizer
plant needs gas for plant testing.                                          -
Current estimates of capital cost show an increase of about 25
percent over the appraisal report figures. Part I shows an increase of 17 per-
cent, due to currency revaluatioas and changes made necessary as detailed design
progressed and the true composition of the gas supply became known.   Part II
has been enlarged to increase transmission of gas, in part to meet the increased
needs of the fertilizer complex but also to supply a greatly increased usage by
Pertarnina for its refineries and by power plants.    This has increased the cost
of Part II by about 78 percent, but has lowered the cost of gas to the fertilizer
complex since the system throughput has been increased by 104 percent.
Current estimates indicate that these factors will result in in-
creased foreign exchange costs of US$20.2 million equivalent, including contin-
gencies and a potential bonus for the general contractor if he completes the
facilities ahead of the agreed schedule.    AID and OBXF have agreed to contri-
bute ;14.0 million and .$4.5 mrillion respectively to help finance the foreign
exchange cost overrun, and the Association has submitted to its Excecutive
Directors a proposal to increase Credit No. 193-IND from $30.0 mullion to
$35.0 million.  The Government will cover the balance required to complete both
parts of the project.
Despite the capital cost increase, the project has become more
remiunerative. The economic rate of return has increased from 14 to 21 percent
and, because of recent market developments a faster build-up of sales and
hiigher market prices can be expected than assumed in the appraisal report.

Cr. No. 19b   Agricultural Estates II:  US$17 Million Credit of June 15., 1970;
Closing Date: June 30, 1975.
Comments on the progress of this project are the same as -those
on Credit 155-IND above.  The managerial problems, however, are not so acute.
Cr. No. 195   Irrigation Rehabilitatiorn II:  US.$18.5 MiXllion Credit of June 15,
1970; Closing Date: November 30, 1976,
This US.a8.5 million credit is -the second irrigation rehabilitation
project in Indonesia. It includes rehabilitation and drainage works for 186,000 ha.
After a slow start, due to problems with preparation of tender documents and diffi-
culties in obtairing acceptable bids, work is now proceeding somewhat bet-ter.
Although problems of quality and. progress still exist, if good contractors bid and
win the awards on the last two (and largest) contracts, for whlich bids will open
shortly, the project could still be completed on schedule. There are no serious
cost overruns in the overall project.  iisbursements are picking up but are still
slow and, at. December 31, 1972, were only 43 percent of the estimate shown in the
appraisal report.
Cr. No. 210  Telecommunications Expansion;  US$12.8 Million Credit of Juily 13,
1970;  Closing Date:  June 30, 
After a slow start due to procurement difficulties the project is
now progressing satisfactorily. Orders for all equipment, except the tropospheric
scatter system, have been placed. The management consultants retained to study
thie telecommunications authority and recommend remedial measures have completed
their work and have also been retained to implement the recommendations.
Cr. No. 211  Fisheries;  US$3.5 Million Credit of July 13, 1970; Closing Date:
June 30, 1976.
This project is abou.t 18 months behind the original implementation
schedule and disbursements are low.  The principal cause for the delay has
been the unsatisfactory management and engineering assistance.  Arrangements
adth new engineering consultants have been concluded and proposals for improved
m.n.nagement assistance to the project are being considered by the Government.
Prospects for successful project implementation remain good.
Cr. No. 216  Technical Assistance II  US$4.o0 Million Credit of September 15,
1970;  Closing Date:  December 31, 1973.
This project is progressing satisfactorily.
Cr. No. 219  Education:  US$4.6 Million Credit of November 6, 1970; Closing
Date: December 31, 197b.
Implementation of this project fell a year behind schedule due to
d iays in the Government' s evaluation of consultants and. to uncertainties regarding
t,e liability of foreign contractors and consultants for Indonesian income tax.
A contract with consultants was signed in June 1972, and the project is now
p-ogressing satisfactorily.

Cr. No. 220   Irrigation Rehabilitation III:   US$14.5 Million Credit of November 6,
1970;  Closing Date:  December 31, 1975.
This US$14.5 million credit is the third irrigation rehabilitation
project in Indonesia. It covers 202,000 ha and includes rehabilitation and re-
introduction of an 0 & M organization in three irrigation systems, two in Java
and one in South Sulewesi.   Construction is presently behind schedule due to prob-
lems with preparation of contract documents, a slow start in civil works contracts,
and the over-extention of the few experienced local contractors brought about by
the large volume of construction work in Indonesia.   Some improvements in the rate
of execution are expected, but it is still estimated that the project's completion
date will be between two and three years behind that anticipated at appraisal.
Overall project cost estimates have increased by 15 percent. The Government has
made arrangements to meet this cost overrun.   Iisbursements are 50 percent below
the level estimated at appraisal but are now picking up.    Sensitivity tests run
at the time of appraisal showed that with a two-year delay in the project and a
15 percent overall cost overrun the eccnomic rate of return (ERR) would drop from
25 percent to 21 percent.
Cr. No. 2b6   Seeds:  US$7.5 Million Credit of May 19, 1971;   Closing Date:
September 30, 1977
Progress of this project has been hampered by delays in the pro-
vision of funds by the Government and by slow procurement of equipment. The
last supervision mission reported that these problems are being overcome but
that project costs are likely to be higher than appraisal report estimates due
to delays in execution and international exchange rate adjustments.   This matter
is currently being discussed with the Government and will be reviewed in detail
by a supervision mission scheduled for early summer, when cost information will
be more complete.
Cr. No. 259   Tea:  US$15.0 MUllion Credit of June 24, 1971;   Closing Date:
June 30, 197d.
