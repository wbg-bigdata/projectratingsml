MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO ROMANIA
FOR AN INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
1.          I submit the following memorandum and recommendation on a proposed
loan to Romania for US$175 million for approval. The proposed loan would be a
single currency loan in US dollars on standard terms approved by the Board for
the Single Currency Pilot Program, with 20 years maturity including five years
grace, and would help finance an Industrial Development Project.
2.          Sector Background.   Since the 1989 revolution, the Government of
Romania has formulated and started the implementation of a transition program
towards an efficient market economy. A new legal and institutional framework has
been established, and the policy framework has been substantLally liberalized.
The commercialization and corporatization of the state enterprise sector has been
completed. The regulatory and institutional framework for privatizetion has been
put in place. The Government plans to divest about 6,300 state-owned commercial
enterprises and 30 percent of the state's equity has already been divested
through allocation to five Private Ownership Funds and mass distribution of their
shares. About 490 small to medium-size companies have been already privatized
and another 500 are in active preparation for privatization.   The ownership
reform of the state sector is supplemenced by a broad program to support the
growth of indigenous private sector enterprises. About 546,000 new private firms
were registered by end-1993, and about 78 percent of these have already opened
for business, of which 30 percent are in manufacturing and trade. About 29,000
joint ventures have been formed, of which about 100 involve large enterprises.
In the 1991-1993 period, the private sector (excluding agriculture) has
productively absorbed over one million employees. Its participation in GDP has
grown from less than one percent in 1989 to about ten percent in 1991 and an
estimated 30 percent in 1993. There are, however, some areas where progress has
lagged. The growth of private firms has been inhibited by crowding out from
access to capital, raw materials, and infrastructure. The adjustment of Romanian
state-owned industrial enterprises to changing relative prices has been slow and
largely reactive, and hindered by the weak enterprise financial discipline.
Recent changes in economic policies can be expected to deepen the adjustments
already begun and to stimulate a more rapid positive output response.
3.          The reform of the banking system was initiated early in the process
of transformation to a market economy and a two-tier banking was established in
1990. The state-owned banks were commercialized and rechartered as universal
banks. During the last three years, the banking sector has developed rapidly.
Open access and the universal banking approach have yielded a multitude of new
private banks and the emergence of competition.   Market segmentation and
concentration, in both deposit and loan markets, is still considerable. However,
the dominance of the state-owned banks is now being successfully challenged by
the rapidly growing private banks. The private banks' share of the total assets
of the commercial banks rose from 3.2 percent at end-1.991 to 15.9 percent at end-



- 2 -
1993; their share of the non-government loans increased from 2.7 percent to 12.1
percent during the same period; the share of deposits increased from 3.8 percent
to 15.4 percent; and the share of the total equity of the banking sector from 7
percent to 27 percent. In spite of the difficult macroeconomic environment, the
financial position of Romanian banks improved in the 1990-1993 period.
Capitalization has improved from 2.5 percent in 1990 to about 8 percent at end-
1992 and was about 6.8 percent at end-1993.   The macroeconomic environment
continues to be volatile, and a level playing field for all economic agents has
yet to be fully developed.   This creates problems in appraising and pricing
credit, interest rate and currency risks. The capacity of Romanian banks to take
and sustain risk is, however, seriously impaired by the lack of loan
classification and provisioning requirements and by the generally low level of
loan loss reserves. The current level of the (tax deductible) general loan loss
reserves mandated at 0.5 percent of banks' asset portfolio, seriously taxes the
banks' capacity to sustain risk.
4.          Rationale for Bank Involvement.  In the period since the revolution,
at the macro-level, the new economic policies have introduced liberalization
(e.g., prices, foreign trade, interest rates, entry and exit policies),
decentralization and competition (e.g., in banking, industry, agriculture), and
emphasized market and private sector orientation.   At the micro-level,  the
Government has commercialized virtually all enterprises in the trade and
manufacturing sector. Financial policies and entry to the banking sector and
markets have been liberalized, resulting in emergence of the new private
institutions and in changes of financial markets structure. The Government has
also recognized that export development and integration of the Romanian economy
into the international financial and goods markets is a key to successful
transition and to achieving a sustainable growth path.   To this end,  the
Government has opened entry to the trade sector; liberalized foreign trade;
unified and simplified the tariff regime; practically removed exchange controls
on current account transactions; and started to manage exchange rate through
market mechantsms.    However,  supply  response  to  the new  incentives  and
opportunities has been slower than expected.
5.          The Government sees the private sector as the main engine of new
wealth creation and growth in the future. The promotion of efficient private
enterprises and a wholesale privatization of state enterprises is a cornerstone
of the Government's  transition strategy.   The Government also  intends to
liquidate non-viable state enterprises in order to release resources for private
sector growth, and to facilitate development of a healthy, efficient and market-
oriented financial sector able to provide equity capital, working capital and
investment finance needed by the private sector. The proposed Project supports
implementation of the Government's transition strategy.   It will promote the
development of the private sector by supporting private and privatized
enterprises and exporters. It will also support reform of the banking sector by
helping to establish prudential regulations, to strengthen individual banks and
by encouraging restructuring and privatization of state-owned banks.    By
supporting elements of the adjustment program that would generate output, exports
and employment, the proposed Project will also facilitate implementation of those
elements of the reform program that entail contraction of economic activities.



6.          Project Objectives.  In line with the country assistance strategy,
discussed by the Board on April 5, 1994, the principal objectives of the proposed
Project are to:  (a) create conditions for an effective supply response and
promote growth of viable private industrial enterprises, and to increase exports;
(b) stimulate transformation of Romanian credit markets and Introduction of safe
and sound banking practices; and (c) advance structural transformation of the
enterprise sector in Romania, and specifically privatization and restructuring.
7.          Project  Description.    The  loan of US$175  million comprises:
(a) US$102 million for Jnvestments of private enterprises aimed to improve
international competitiveness and/or expand exports; (b) US$70.0 million for
export finance by providing partial to full coverage of preshipment finance needs
for imported inputs; and (c) US$3.0 million for technical assistance to help in
policy formulation and to strengthen institutional capacity in the areas of
privatization and restructuring, and in the banking sector.
8.          The loan will be made to Romania through the Ministry of Finance
(MOP). It will be a US dollar loan, under the Bank's Single Currency Loan (SCL)
pilot program.1 The onlending will be managed by an apex involving the National
Bank of Romania (NBR) and the MOF, and intermediated by participating banks. The
access to participation will be kept open, and banks will be qualified based on
their capital adequacy, satisfactory financial conditions and operating policies,
and staff skills and experience.   Five banks have been qualified so far,
including the Foreign Trade Bank, the Societe Generale, the Chemical Bank, the
Romanian Development Bank and the Tiriac Commercial Bank. Another three banks
have substantially met qualification criteria, but need to take some corrective
actions before they are qualified.
9.          The subsidiary loans to participating financial interrediaries (PFIs)
will be extended on a first-come first-served basis and back-to-back to the PFI
subloans to final beneficiaries. The subsidiary loans i.o PFIs will be made in
US dollars at the prevailing six-month LIBOR, plus a spread of 30 basis points
to cover the MOF apex related expenses.  The PFis would onlend the funds to
eligible private enterprises for eligible investment projects and export
transactions.   The access to investment finance will be limited to private
enterprises, in good financial condition and with adequate capacity to bear the
foreign exchange risk, with satisfactory business plans and with economic and
financial rates of return on subprojects of a minimum of 15 percent. The access
to export finance will be open to exporters with confirmed export orders,
adequate export experience and positive value-added for the export products based
on world prices. The subloans will be made in US dollars at interest rates based
on six-month LIBOR plus the MOF margin of 30 basis points and a market-based
spread to be determined by each PFI. The investment subloans, of up to US$8
million and the three to 17 years maturity with one to five-year grace period,
will be extended at variable interest rates. The subloans for export finance,
of up to US$5 million and maturities of up to one year, will be extended at fixed
1/ The participating banks are eligible for SCLs since they have a need for a US dollar loan to match revenues
from lending to their clients, who are expected to earn export revenues in US dollars. SCL terms will reduce
the currency and interest rate risk that the MOF or the PFIs would have faced with currency pool loan terms.



- 4 -
interest rates. The PFIs will assume the full credit risk. The beneficiaries
will assume the foreign exchange risk and the interest rate risk for the term-
lending.
10.         The technical assistance component entails programs for the Ministry
of  Industry,  for  studies  and  consulting  assistance  to  develop  sector
restructuring and privatization strategies, to improve environmental assessment
capacity and to design a framework for industrial technology infrastructure
management; for the NBR, for consulting services to the banking sector to improve
asset/liability and risk management policies and practices, to strengthen
internal controls and auditing and to implement the new chart of accounts and
improve bookkeeping practices; and for the PFIs, to develop credit' and risk
management policies, strengthen their appraisal capacity and improve credit
administration. Technical assistance funds will be onlent to implementing
agencies through separate arrangements within the Government, and will be managed
by the implementing agencies.
11,          Procurement of items which cost US$100,000 equivalent or more will
follow the Bank Procurement Guidelines established for financial intermediary
operations. For items which cost less than US$100,000 equivalent, the normal
commercial practices of the beneficiaries will be followed. For the investment
finance, items which cost US$100,000 to US$1 million equivalent would be procured
through international shopping on the basis of it least three competitive
quotations obtained from suppliers in two eligible countries; for items which
cost more than US$1 million equivalent, limited international bidding would be
followed. For the export finance, items which cost US$100,000 to US$3 million
equivalent would be procured through international shopping on the basis if at
least three competitive quotations obtained from suppliers in two eligible
countries; for items which cost more than US$3 million equivalent, limited
international bidding would be followed.   For the technical assistance, the
implementing agencies would follow the Bank Guidelines for the Use of
Consultants.
12.         Disbursements under US$1 million per item would be made against a
certified statement of expenditures (SOE), for which appropriate documentation
would be retained by the PFIs and the implementing agencies. Disbursements above
US$1 million per item would be made on the basis of full documentation.   A
special account covering up to four months' expenditures would be established to
facilitate loan disbursements. For the export credit component, the MOF would
also create an account to hold the repayments of subsidiary loans by PFIs. Funds
would be used to finance other export credits for the same purposes and under the
same terms and conditions as the original funds.
13.         The initial commitment cut-off date is on January 1, 1996.  At that
time, the Bank will review exchange and interest rate policies, foreign trade
p-licies and Project's implementation record. The performance criteria for a
satisfactory implementation record are: (a) at least US$26 million of project
funds committed; (b) at least US$20 million of project funds disbursed; (c)
projects and export transactions amounting to at least US$20 million in the
lending pipeline; and (d) at least two financial institutions still qualified and
participating in the project.   If, on the basis of this review,  the Bank



- 5 -
determines that the Project implementation record is satisfactory and that the
macroeconomic envirorunent remains conducive to -the attainment of the Project's
objectives, the final subloan commitment date will be extended to December 31,
1997.  Otherwise, the Bank may choose, in cooperation with the Government, to
redesign or close the proposed Project.   The closing date for the loan is
December 31, 1998.
14.         A breakdown of costs and the financing plan are shown in Schedule P.
The procurement methods, with amounts and disbursements, are shown in Schedule
B. A timetable of key project processing events and the status of Bank Group
operations in Romania are given in Schedules C and D, respectively. The Staff
Appraisal Report No. 11542-RO dated April 25, 1994 is being distributed
separately.
15.         Agreed Actions.   During the negotiations,  agreements with the
Ministry of Finance were reached on the following:
(a)   Conditions of Effectiveness.   The following would be the
conditions for loan effectiveness:   (i) Subsidiary Credit
Agreements signed by at least two PFIs; (U) NBR regulations
to increase general loan loss reserves to 2 percent issued;
(iii) MBR regulations on risk-based capital adequacy issued;
and (iv) NBR regulations on asset classification and
provisio:-ing issued;
(b)   Condition of Disbursemcnt.  For the export credit component,
MOF would establish an export finance facility, satisfactory
to the Bank, to revolve export credits during the loan grace
period; and
(c)   Condition concerning Loan Commitment Period.   The initial
commitment cut-off date will be on January 1, 1996. At that
time, the Bank will perform a review (para. 13) and, if
satisfied, extend the loan commitment date to December 31,
1997.
16.         Benefits.  The proposed Project would support competitive, viable
private enterprises.  It will assist the Government to formulate and implement
policies for furthering privatization and restructuring; create conditions for
effective supply response; introduce prudential regulations and strengthen bank
supervision; improve the capacity of the financial sector to provide export
finance seivices and to appraise, finance and supervise investment projects; and
facilitate access to finance for private enterprises.  Healthy and efficient
private financial institutions will increase competition in Romanian credit
markets and contribute to financial market integration.   By helping PFIs to
develop expertise in project -3nding, the proposed Project would promote more
efficient  investments.    Other  indirect benefits  include  improvements  in
enterprise management, economic benefits related to returns on investment, export
growth, and environmental benefits.



- 6-
17.         Risks.  The main project risk is a shortfall resulting from general
institutional weaknesses. This risk has been addressed by including technical
assistance for all participants in the Project.  Close supervision, beyond a
level normally allocated for Bank's projects, will also help to contain this
risk.
18.         Volatility and uncertain economic prospects may adversely affect the
PFIs willingness to diversify and/or to engage in long-term lending; a general
increase i.. non-performing assets would decrease PFIs capacity to take the credit
risk associated with the proposed Project. This is addressed by keeping access
open to eligible PFIs; by strengthening the capacity of banks to take and sustain
risk by increasing the level of general loan loss reserves; through technical
assistance to PFIs to better manage risks, off- and on-balance sheet, and by
improving their capacities to assess credit risk associated with particular
borrowers and projects; through preparation of sector studies which could be
utilized Lii projects' appraisal; and by maintaining flexibility in terms of
reallocation of investment component funds to export finance, and vice-versa.
The credit risk by the PFIs has been specifically addressed by extending the
Bank's single currency loan; borrowing and onlending on SCL terms will reduce the
currency and interest rate risk that Romania or the PFIs would have borne with
currency pool loan terms.   On the other hand,  there is a risk that the
enterprises investment demand may have been overestimated.   This has been
addressed through promotional activities initiated early during Project
preparation, including a program to build a strong pipeline of viable projects.
19.         The macroeconomic instability and deterioration of the business
environment is a major risk. It could adversely affect investments and exports
and contribute to rapid deterioration of enterprise viability and PFI financial
conditions and profitability.   This risk is addressed by the Bank's SAL ar.d
through ongoing macroeconomic policy dialogue. In addition, the macroeconomic
environment and the progress in transition prograns and in project implementation
will be thoroughly reviewed about one year after loan effectiveness, with an
option to stop further commitments or change implementation arrangements in case
of serious adverse developments.
20.         Environment Issues.   The proposed Project has beer reviewed and
placed in environment screening Category B.   All sub-borrowers under the
investment credit component of the proposed Project will be required to comply
with environmental protection regulations of the country, acceptable to the Bank.
In appraising subprojects, the PFIs will ensure that the sub-borrowers have
received clearance from competent regulatory agencies regarding the environmental
impact of their investments. During subproject implementation, the PFIs will
review compliance with environmental regulations in the course of normal
subproject supervision.



- 7 -
21.         Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the IBRD and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
