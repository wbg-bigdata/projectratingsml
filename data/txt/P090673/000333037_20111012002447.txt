                                       RESTRUCTURING PAPER


SUMMARY
This restructuring paper seeks approval for the following changes to the Rural Investment
and Services Project (APL#2) (CREDIT 4157-MD/GRANT H211-MD/CREDIT 4416-
MD/CREDIT 4563-MD):

       (a) The reallocation of project proceeds amounting to US$3.9 million from the
           Drought Adaptation Component, Sub-Component 1: Irrigation Finance Services
           (RISP II AF, Project Paper, P110421) to the project’s Rural Finance Component
           Credit Line (RISP II PAD, P090673).

                                     Project Costs (US$m.)
                      Components/Activities                Current1                              Proposed

    Rural Finance Component                                                  21.10                 25.00
    Drought Adaptation Component,
    Sub-Component 1: Irrigation Finance Services                             05.20                 01.30

       (b) The amendment of the Financing Agreement (CREDIT 4416-MD) to add a new
           activity under Schedule 1, Project Description, namely Rural Finance. In light of
           the multiple sources of funding, this particular change (not category reallocation)
           is necessary to allow for resources currently earmarked only for investments in
           on-farm irrigation equipment under the Drought Adaptation Component, Sub-
           Component 1 to be used for financing of other types of investments that are
           eligible under the Rural Finance Component. Financing of irrigation-related
           investments has been below expectations due to a history of favorable
           precipitation levels in 2008-2011 that stifled demand for them.

       (c) The extension of the concessionary terms that are currently applicable to
           irrigation sub-loans (20% grant), to loans financing investments in low-till
           equipment and technology, as requested by the MAFI. These terms would help to
           stimulate the adoption of conservation agricultural practices.

       (d) The revision of the results framework to reflect changes in the project targets
           resulting from the above proposed changes.

The proposed changes will not affect the PDO and will not increase the credit amount.
This is the first restructuring of the project.

    If the project has had a previous restructuring, the current should reflect the latest approved costs.

PROJECT STATUS
The project continues to make satisfactory progress towards the PDO. This is despite a
slowdown in the growth of some of the indicators throughout 2010. Both PDO indicators
are still expected to be met by the project’s closing date. Approximately 80% of all IDA
and SIDA resources were disbursed as of March 31, 2011. Disbursements are
satisfactory, with the exception of disbursements under the Irrigation Finance Services
Sub-Component which has failed to disburse as originally expected, because of favorable
weather in the years since funds were made available and because the economic crisis has
shifted savings/investments patterns of the farmers. The Ministry of Finance requested a
restructuring of this component on March 24, 2011.


PROPOSED CHANGES
  • Revision of the Financing Agreement – adding part C – Rural Finance Credit Line
     with the following description:?Provision of Sub-loans by PFIs to eligible
     Beneficiaries in accordance with the criteria and principles set forth or referred
     to in the Rural Investment Guidelines. Sub-loans for minimum-till investments are
     to include conditional concessionary terms.?; Other minor additional revisions
     aimed at achieving consistency and conformity throughout the Financing
     Agreement in light of the addition of Part C.

   •   Revision of the Supplemental Letter no.2 for both the original Rural Investment
       and Services Project (APL#2) between the Recipient and the Association, dated
       April 13, 2006 (Credit No. 4157 MD and Grant No. H211 MD), as well as the
       Additional Financing for the Second Rural Investment and Services Project
       (Credit No.4416-MD) to reflect ensuing changes in the project’s Results
       Framework.

   •   Results/indicators:
          o Component 3. Intermediate Result indicator: Number of loans disbursed
              from the credit facility – Original value 450; Revised value 600;
          o Component 5. Intermediate Result indicator 1: Number of rehabilitated
              hectares irrigated - Original value 3000 hectares; Revised value 700
              hectares.
          o Component 5. Intermediate Result indicator 1: Size of investments in
              irrigation - Original value US$6.0 million; Revised value US$1.2 million.

Project Development Objective (PDO): The project is the second Phase of a two-phase Rural Investment and Services Program. The Program objective is to provide long-term support to
accelerate agricultural recovery and growth so that Moldova's agricultural and rural sectors can play their full role in providing the underpinnings for future income growth and poverty
reduction. Under this overarching objective, the project will strive to continue foster the post-privatization growth in the agricultural and rural sectors of Moldova by improving access of
farmers and rural entrepreneurs to legal ownership status, know-how, knowledge and financial services, while building the capacity of the private and public institutions to ensure the
sustainability of the activities.
Revised Project Development Objective: Not applicable
