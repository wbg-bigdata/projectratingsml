                  Senegal — Local Authorities Development Project
                            (P084022) - Credit 4224-SE

                                  Restructuring Paper


1.    The closing date for Senegal, Local Authorities Development Project, Credit
4224-SE, P084022, will be extended from December 31, 2011 until September 30, 2013.

Project Objective and Financing

2.       The project in the amount of SDR 53.8 million (US$80 million equivalent) was
approved by the Board on July 18, 2006. The Financing Agreement was signed on July
26, 2006 and became effective on January 22, 2007. The project’s development objectives
are to: (a) strengthen the urban municipalities’ capacity to improve resource mobilization,
municipal and urban management; and (b) improve the provision of infrastructure and
services in urban areas.

Progress towards achieving the project development objectives

3.      Based on the findings of the May 2011 supervision mission, the project is on track
to achieve its development objectives - (i) the level of resource mobilization has reached
an estimated 24 percent compared to the 2010 target of 25 percent; (ii) the part allocated
annually through the local authorities' budget to finance infrastructure and maintenance
made significant improvement from 2.6 percent in 2009 to 12.07 percent in 2010, largely
exceeding the 2010 target of 6 percent; and (iii) the number of persons directly benefiting
from at least one subproject has reached 1,020,000 (the end-of-project target is
1,550,000).

Implementation Progress

4.      Implementation progress (IP) was downgraded to Moderately Satisfactory in
September 2009 to reflect slow implementation of the investment program due to an
initial lack of counterpart funds and procurement delays. The Government is now
releasing the counterpart funds in a satisfactory manner; most of the contracts were
signed, and the preliminary activities (“contrat de ville?) and the Resettlement Action
Plan (RAP) have been approved and mostly completed. In order for the Municipal
Development Agency (ADM) and the contracting agency, AGETIP, to cope with the
remaining bottlenecks, a detailed action plan was prepared during the mid-term review in
February 2010. It was reinforced in early 2011.

5.    Important progress was made during the past months: the level of works
commitments has reached about 82 percent and the disbursement rate has significantly

                                            3
improved, with a steady US$2 million average per month since April 2011. Withdrawal
applications totaling US$4.6 million were presented for disbursement and approved, but
are not reflected in the system because they were used to reimburse the designated
account advance for which the refund is already ongoing. As a result, the October 2011
supervision mission will recommend an upgrade of the IP rating from Moderately
Satisfactory to Satisfactory in the next ISR.

Extension of Closing Date

6.      One key reason for slow disbursements is the delays in implementation of the
investment program attributable to AGETIP, which is carrying out the work program for
48 communes. Although AGETIP is a well-managed entity, it was overloaded with many
other programs and suffered a lack of efficient oversight and close management of the
PRECOL program. Corrective actions were identified early in 2011 and implemented:
AGETIP and ADM recruited short-term consultants to streamline the implementation of
the works. To date, most of the procurement activities for the IDA-financed investment
program have been completed. The monthly reporting system set in place by ADM since
mid-2011 will stay operational to allow for potential additional measures to be identified
and implemented if needed. The coming missions will ensure that timely implementation
of the works will stay within the remaining time frame. Based on these specific measures
already implemented and the actual significant increase of the disbursement level (see
paragraph 5 above), it is expected that project activities will be fully implemented by the
proposed revised closing date.

7.     This will be the first extension of the project.

Financial Management

8.      There are no major issues on the financial management side of the project and
there are no outstanding audit reports.
