MEMORANDUM AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
OF THE INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
ON A PROPOSED LOAN TO
INDIA
FOR THE KARNATAKA POWER PROJECT
1.      The following report on a proposed loan to India for US$330 million
equivalent is submitted for approval. The loan would be at the standard
variable interest rate and would be repayable over 20 years including 5 years
grace. It would help to finance a power project in the State of Karnataka in
Southern India.
2.      Background.  Karnataka has no indigenous coal resources and, apart
from imports from Government of India (GOI) owned stations or neighboring
states, it has been primarily dependent for power on the development of its
own hydro resources. These are economically attractive but delays in project
preparation have left the State with chronic power shortages. The typical
energy cut that the Karnataka Electricity Board (KEB) has had to impose on
large consumers has increased from around 25% in 1981/82 to 75% in 1985/86, a
trend mirrored in applications for captive plant, which have grown from about
5 MW in 1981/82 to 150 hW in 1985/86. The rising demand for captive plant,
using high value fuels, underscores the importance of accelerating the
development of low cost hydro resources for the public supply system and the
Kalinadi basin offers particularly attractive opportunities for this. The
Karnataka Power Corporation (KPC), which is the agency responsible for power
generation in the State, has planned development of the basin in three
stages. Stage-I, including construction of the Supa dam, is nearing comple-
tion. This dam will provide very large storage at the head of the Kalinadi
river and allow downstream sites with minimal storage to be utilized
throughout the year. Three sites were initially identified by KPC for
development in Stage-II and were posed to the Bank. Since then a private
sector industrial company has expressed interest in developing one of these
sites and Government of Karnataka (GOK) is waiting for a decision on this
from GOI. The remaining two sites, Kadra and Kodasalli, are included in the
proposed Project. Plans for Stage-III, which would involve tributaries to
the Kalinadi, are still very tentative owing to significant environmental
problems. Following completion of Stage-II there will be six reservoirs and
five power stations in the Kalinadi basin.
3.      Karnataka, in common with most other states in India, has failed to
develop its transmission and distribution systems at a rate commensurate with
growth in generation.  Consequently, these systems have become increasingly
overloaded, resulting in an adverse effect on system losses which have
recently been estimated at approximately 22% of net generation. KEB is
responsible for transmission and distribution in Karnataka. At the request
of the Bank, KEB has prepared a transmission plan for inclusion in the
proposed Project that would not just serve to evacuate power from Kalinadi
but would also reinforce the existing grid and reduce system losses. The



-2-
plan will greatly strengthen transmission between the gen"ration complex in
the northwest of Karnataka and the State's largpst load conter, Bangalore,
in the oautheast.  The grow,h in demand in Bangalore, which has boon the
fastest growing city in India, has strained not just the transmission system
but also the local distribution system. KEB urgently needs to develop and
implement a distribution master plan for Bangalore, but does not have
in-house expertise in state-of-the-art distribution planning technique.
4.      Project ObJectives.  The proposed Project is designed to:  alleviate
power shortages in Karnataka and the Southern Region by exploiting low cost
indigenous hydro resources; provide efficient transmission capacity to
evacuate power from the Kalinadi complex and reduce system losses; extend the
life and make fuller use of the Sharavathi power station; optimise generation
from the Kalinadi complex; prepare plans for more efficient distribution;
effect institutional, operational and financial improvements in both KPC and
KEB; and make progress towards more efficient use of the Southern Region's
generation facilities.
5.      Project Description.  The proposed Project comprisest
(a) construction of a 3 x 40 MW hydro scheme at Kodasalli; tb) construction
of a 3 x 50 MS hydro scheme at Kadra; (c) resettlement, rehabilitation and
compensatory afforestation measures associated with (a) and (b);
(d) renovation of the existing Sharavathi hydro power station;
(e) implementation of a computerized generation management scheme for the
complete Kalinadi complex, including installation of 'System Control and Data
Acquisition' (SCADA) equipment and associated communications;
(f) computerization of management information and accounting systems and
certain planning activities in KPCI (g) execution of a training program for
KPC; (h) consultancy services for (a) to (g) above and advice on treatment to
reduce seepage from the Talakalale dam; Ci) construction of: (i) about
570 kms of single and double circuit 400-kV line; and (ii) about 300 kms of
single and double circuit 220-kV line together with associated substations;
(j) consultancy services for: ti) the design and construction supervision of
400-kV lines and substations; (ii) preparation of a distribution master plan
for Bangalore followed by supervisory assistance for further distribution
planning by KEB; and (iii) advice on protection and compensation aspects of
transmission; (k) implementation of an institutional development program for
KEB, including acquisition of data processing facilities, consultancy and
training services for: (i) development of a system for maintaining technical
records; (ii) establishment of proper fixed asset registers;
(iii) establishment of a management information system; (iv) an organization
and management study for the finance function; (v) computerization of certain
activities in planning, operational statistics, accounting and inventory
control; and tvi) a tariff and metering study; and (1) consultancy services
for the design of load dispatch arrangements for the Southern Region.
6.      The total cost of the proposed Project, which will be implemented
over a period of about 8 years, is estimated at US$947.2 million equivalent



-3-
including interest during construction, of which the foreign exchange com-
ponent is estimated at US$372.2 million (39%). Cost estimates, the financing
plan and retroactive financing arrangements are shown in Schedule A.
Procurement and disbursement arrangements and the disbursement schedule are
shown in Schedule B. A timetable of key project processing events and the
status of Bank Group operations in India are given in Schedules C & D respec-
tively. Two maps, IBRD Nos. 19792R and 19793, are attached.
7.      Rationale for Bank Involvement.  Through the Project, the Bank would
support GOI/GOK's efforts to: (a) alleviate power shortages in the Southern
Region by exploiting indigenous hydro resources; (b) undertake timely renova-
tion of the Sharavati hydropower station; and (c) augment transmission
capacity, thereby reducing system losses. In addition the Bank would help
to: (a) maximise the value of generation from the Kalinadi complex;
(b) introduce state-of-the-art distribution planning techniques to KEB;
(c) effect institutional and financial improvements in relation to both KPC
and KEB; and (d) support progress towards fully integrated operation of the
Southern Region. The Project is, therefore, fully consistent with the Bank's
strategy towards the Indian power subsector.
8.      Agreed Actions.  GOK has agreed to: (a) onlend the proceeds of the
loan to KPC and KEB at an interest rate of not less than 10.75% pa; (b) make
all its loans to KPC and KEB repayable over 20 years including 5 years of
grace and; (c) ensure the implementation of the resettlement plan (involving
544 families) agreed with the Bank. In addition, GOK has agreed to cause KEB
to: (a) earn a rate of return after interest of at least 3%; (b) collect, by
Apil 1, 1990, accounts receivable from its principal debtors as of March 31,
1987, in accordance with a dated and monitorable plan acceptable to the Bank;
(c) clear arrears due to KPC in accordance with a program paralleling the
reduction in the Board's own accounts receivable; (d) pay promptly all future
sums owing to KPC using a revolving letter of credit; (e) clear anomalies in
its asset accounts in accordance with a timetable acceptable to the Bank; and
(f) install meters for all consumers that should be metered and replace
faulty meters in accordance with a timetable acceptable to the Bank. KPC
has agreed to: (a) appoint experts in engineering geology and foundation
engineering to the dam review panel of experts (POE) by July 31, 1987;
(b) review with the POE the results of investigations of the limestone forma-
tion at Kodasalli and furnish a report recommending treatment, if necessary,
to the Bank by N. iember 30, 1987; (c) initiate, by July 1, 1987, a study to
develop a program of actions to reduce seepage from the Talakale dam;
(d) take all measures necessary to earn a rate of return after interest of at
least 3%; and (e) revise reporting arrangements and ensure a full complement
of suitably qualified staff for its internal audit unit by December 31, 1987.
GOI has given an assurance that the relevant regulatory authorities will
monitor all existing or future sources of pollution that may materially
affect water quality in the Kadra and Kodasalli reservoirs and ensure
adherence to GOI's environmental standards.



-4-
9.      Justification.  Economic benefits tnder the proposed Project are
expected from (a) increases in the quantum of power supplied to consumers;
(b) improvements in the quality of power supply; (c) reduced system lossas;
and (d) greater efficiency in the use of assets in the public power supply
system. The least cost power development program for the Southern Region,
of which the proposed Project is an integral part, is e-2ected to have a
quantifiable economic rate of return of at least 12Z.
10.     RisIs.  There are no extraordinary technical risks associated with
the Project, which does not involve any engineering technology beyond the
limits of well known practices. With the exception of a limestone formation
at Kodasalli, which is the subject of specific investigations, the geological
information is adequate and indicates good conditions. KPC and KEB have
sufficient staff experienced in supervising and executing activities similar
to most of the project components and consultants will be used in all areas
in which KPC or KEB lacks in-house expertise.
11.     Recommendation.  I am satisfied that the proposed loan would comply
with the Articles of Agreement of the Bank and recommend that the Executive
Directors approve it.
