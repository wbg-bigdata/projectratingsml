APPRAISAL OF ASIHUG'ANJ FERTILIZER P'ROJECT
STIJ4ARY XND CONCLUSIONS
i.        This report appraises thle proposed construiction of an ammonia/urea
fertilizer plant in Bangladesh.  The plant would have a 925 metric tons per
day (TPD) ammonia un.it and a 1,600 TPD urea unit and use natural gas fron a
nearby field as fuel and feedstock.  It would be built at Ashuganj, about
60 km northeast of Dacca. A new company, the Ashuganj Fertilizer and
Chemical Company (AFCC) was recently established to own and operate the plant.
All shares will be held by the Government of Bangladesh. The proposed project
would be the Bank Group's largest direct investment in the country's industry.
ii.       The objectives of the project are to help meet the country's need
for nitrogen fertilizer at an economic cost by using Bangladesh's abundant
and highly suitable reserves of natural gas and to eliminate its dependence
on costly nitrogen fertilizer imports. Given the limited acreage of arable
land and the growing population, the increased use of fertilizer is of criti-
cal importance for the country to feed its people and to increase the output
of cash crops, which is the mainstay of exports at present and in the fore-
seeable future.
iii.     IUntil the new company is sufficiently staffed, the Bangladesh Fer-
tilizer, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Corporation (BFCPC) will be responsible
for project execution. BFCPC presently controls and supervises two urea plants,
at Ghorasal and Fenchuganj and two triple superphosphate (TSP) plants at
Chittagong. In addition 48 chemical and pharmaceutical enterprises, either
left by their former Pakistani owners, or inherited from the East Pakistan
Industrial Development Corporation (EPIDC) were put under BFCPC's umbrella
after independence in 1972. The two existing urea plants need some recon-
ditioning and the Government is taking steps to rehabilitate these units with
external assistance. But the larger of these plants is not expected to resume
production until mid-1975 due to an explosion in its control room. Arrange-
ments have been made to replace the damaged facilities expeditiously. One TSP
plant only recently started trial production while the second unit will under-
go trial production in February 1975 and IDA is helping finance the import
of phosphate rock and sulfur to continue TSP production; thereafter these
plants are expected to have a combined output of 352,000 tons per year (TPY)
of urea and 135,000 TPY of TSP, to which the proposed project would add
anotlher 475,000 TPY of urea.
iv.       The use of fertilizer has rapidly grown in Bangladesh.  Between
1963/64 and 1970/71 total nutrient use increased from 47,900 to 143,000 TPY.
It dropped drastically during the war of independence due to disruptions of
iimports and production but rose sharply to 176,400 nutrient tons in 1972/73,
in spite of the aftermath of war, a severe drought and the general poverty
of the farmers.  Urea consumption in that year came to 272,000 tons, equiva-
lent to 125,000 tons of N, or 71% of total ritutrient use, and shortfalls in
output of the existing plants had to be made up by imnports, for which only



limited funds were available. Furthermore, consumption may well understate
demand since despite sharply increasing fertilizer prices a black market in
urea has developed.
V.        Projecting a conservative demand growth rate of 12.3% over the next
ten years compared with one of 1.3.6% observed during the past decade, supply
and demand would be about in balance in 1981/82; this would leave temporarily
an exportable surplus of up to 100,000 tons per year from 1979/80 to 1980/81,
depending on the output achieved by the existing plants after reconditioning
and the speed with which the proposed project can be brought to full output.
The market, however, is not cons:.dered a constraint, since the project would
be able to sell at competitive prices and any exportable surplus should find
a ready market in India or elswhere in the region.  Marketing and distribution
of the project's output down to the Thana (county) level is the responsi-
bility of the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC). The
Government has initiated a comprEhensive fertilizer marketing and distribution
study to identify the additional steps needed to assure efficient marketing
and distribution of indigenous ard imported fertilizer. The first phase of
the study, financed by USAID, was started April 1974 by the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA) and its report is expected early 1975.
vi.       The project is estimated to cost about US$249 million equivalent,
of which some US$142 million would be in foreign exchange. The Association
assisted the Government in arranging the necessary foreign loans to be pro-
vided by the Asian Development Bank (ADB - US$30 million); the United States
Agency for International Development (AID - US$30 million); the United King-
dom Ministry of Overseas Development (ODM - US$18 million); the Government
of Iran (GOI - US$12.4 million); the Government of the Federal Republic of
Germany acting through Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau; (KfW-US$12 million);
the Government of Switzerland (GOi - US$6.5 million) and the Association (US$33
million). Local currency costs estimated at US$107 million would be covered
by the Government from its own re~sources as equity. All foreign loans would
be made to the Government at concessional terms and would be relent to the
Company which would carry the foreign exchange risk at 10% interest for a
term of 15 years, including 5 yea::s grace.
vii.      The project was first conceived by EPIDC as part of a larger petro-
cliemical complex and assumed its present scope in a dialogue over the past
two years between the Government, BFCPC and the Association. The plant would
employ modern, fully-proven technology and take, at the proposed capacities,
full advantages of economies of scale. BFCPC after examining six alternative
sites has chosen the proposed locc.tion on the eastern bank of the Meghna
River near Ashuganj which, while requiring considerable fill, has the ad-
vantage of being centrally locatec with respect to marketing areas, with
access to almost all parts of the country by rail and riverways, and permit-
ting seacoasters to load at its jetty. Additionally, the Titas gasfield,
which is to supply the plant, and has ample reserves, is only about 12 km
away and a transmission line withi sufficient spare capacity passes the pro-
posed plant site nearby. The Ashuganj Power Plant with sufficient spare
capacity is located about 3 km from the proposed site and the Meghna River
would provide the water needed for cooling, processing and drinking purposes.



- ili -
viii.     BFCPC intends to appoint an Engineering Firm who would have full
responsibility for implementing the project, including the provision of
process 'Licenses, basic and detailed engineering and the management of pro-
curement, construction, start-up, commissioning and training of Bangladesh
staff, and who would provide assistance in initial operation. Invitations
to bid, approved by all lenders, were issued by BFCPC to prequalified en-
gineering firms and proposals are due by February 1975. To strengthen its
technical capability, BFCPC has engaged a consulting firm (a joint venture
between Scientific Design Co., Ltd., U.K. and James Chemical Engineering,
US) to act as its Technical Advisor. It is estimated that the plant will
begin commercial operations in August 1978.
ix.       The project's capitalization based on a stipulated debt/equity
ratio of 60/40 is sound. An ex-plant price of US$155 per ton of bagged urea
is expected to meet a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.5, and yield
a financial rate of return of 9.2% (13.8% before income taxes). The com-
parativelv low rate reflects the high cost of a new plant requiring extensive
site development; the absence of any relief from import duty (approximately
40,) or tax incentives often found in other developing countries; low ex-
factory price; and a high rate of corporate tax (55%). The Company however,
is expected to be in a comfortable financial position after the first operat-
Ing year, accumulate sizable cash reserves, pay dividends from the second
year of operation onwards and/or build up funds for further expansion. The
Government sets the fertilizer prices, wage rates, power charges and the
natural gas price, and the project's financial viability will be safeguarded
through a combination of a maximum debt/equity ratio, a reasonable return on
equity and minimum debt service coverage and current ratios. The financial
rate of return is not very sensitive to moderately adverse developments
involving most assumptions in the financial analysis. It would change by
one percentage point with each increase of US$15 per ton in the ex-plant
price of urea and drop to 6.7% (after taxes) with a one year delay in
construction and a total project cost increase of 20%.
x.        The economic rate of return is 21%Z based on an economic price of
US$175 per ton of urea. nTe return changes by about two percentage points
for each uS$20 difference in the economic price of urea. A 20% cost increase
combined with a one year delay in construction reduces the rate of return
to about 16%. The gross annual foreign exchange savings that can be ascribed
to the project would be about US$74 million or about US$155 per ton of urea.
The project represents very efficient import substitution; approximately
US$50 of local resources are needed to replace US$100 worth of imports.
xi.       There are major risks involved in the project.  To build a
complex fertilizer plant in a country of Bangladesh's state of economic
development is in itself a formidable undertaking. The main risks lie in
further equipment price escalation in a strong sellers' market, delays in
equipment delivery from fully booked suppliers; and most importantly, weak-
nesses in public administration and project management that could result
in costly delays in project implementation and in the time span reasonable
capacity utilization is reached. No country, but least one of Bangladesh's



- iv -
general state of poverty and limited resources, can afford inefficient proj-
ect implementation and the introduction of expatriate expertise in project
management as well as production functions in addition to the Engineering
Firm and the Technical Advisor and their clearly delineated responsibilities
as well as their smooth cooperation with the Bangladesh staff is a sine qua
non for a successful project.
xii.      Agreement was obtained otl such management assistance in a form
satisfactory to the lenders and on the other matters summarized at the end
of this report, and the project is suitable for an IDA credit of US$33
million equivalent.



I. INTRODUCTION
1 .01     The Government of Bangladesh has requested an IDA Credit of US$33
million equivalent for an ammonia-urea fertilizer project expected to cost
US$249 million, including US$142 million in foreign exchange. The balance
of the foreign exchange requirements (US$109 million) would be provided by
the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), the United Kingdom Overseas Development Ministry (ODM),
the Government of Iran (GOI), the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) through
the Kreditanstalt fuer Wiederaufbau (KfW) and the Government of Switzerland
(GOS). The Government of Bangladesh (GOB) would provide the local currency
cost (US$107 million) from its own resources in the form of equity. All
foreign exchange lending would be extended to the Government on concessional
terms.
1.02      The proceeds from foreign borrowing would be onlent by the Govern-
ment to the Ashuganj Fertilizer and Chemical Company (AFCC), a new company
recently established to build and operate the fertilizer plant. The project,
with a rated capacity of 528,000 tons per year (TPY) of urea, or about 243,000
TPY of nitrogen (N) would increase the country's urea manufacturing capacity
to about 970,000 TPY. The plant would be built at Ashuganj, on the eastern
bank of the Meghna River, in the province of Comilla, about 60 km northeast of
Dacca, with rail and water transport connections to all important agricultural
areas of the country (Map, IBRD 10809). It would use natural gas from the
nearby Titas field as feedstock and fuel. Annex 1 gives a glossary of tech-
nical terms commonly used in the fertilizer industry.
1.03      IDA involvement in the project dates back to early 1970, when the
then East Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (EPIDC), presented to
the Association a project consisting of a 320,000 TPY urea plant at the same
location as part of a large petrochemical complex to be based on the same
natural gas resources. After the war of independence, the Government of
Bangladesh requested IDA to review a revised project prepared by the newly
formed Bangladesh Fertilizer, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Corporation (BFCPC)
which had taken over EPIDC's role in the fertilizer and other chemical indus-
tries. During project preparation missions in February, July and October
1973 the present project was developed, and in September 1973 the Government
sought the Association's assistance in securing the necessary foreign ex-
change financing.
1.04      The appraisal was carried out in Bangladesh in March/April 1974
by Messrs. Kaupisch (Chief), Evans and Carpio of the Industrial Projects
Department and Harrison and Hpu of the South Asia Region, concurrently with
missions representing ADB, AID and ODM.
II. THE COMPANY
A.   Background, The Bangladesh Fertilizer Industry
2.01      Chemical fertilizer has been used in Bangladesh since 1955 and
demand has been growing at about 15% annually over the past ten years even
after the disruption caused by the 1971 war of independence. To meet these



-2-
requirements, EPIDC completed in 1961 a 106,000 TPY urea plant at Fenchuganj,
and in 1970 a 340,000 TPY urea plant at Ghorasal based on the latest centrif-
ugal compressor technology. Bothl plants use the country's ample reserves of
non-associated, low sulfur natural gas. While the Fenchugani plant operated
satisfactorily for the first nine years, restart after the war showed dis-
appointing results and a major orerhaul is indicated. The Ghorasal plant,
after passing performance tests, encountered mechanical problems and has
only recently achieved 80% of itt; rated capacity; however, it is sz-ill plagued
with frequent breakdowns and recently the factory has been shut down by an
explosion in the control room and is not expected to resume product.ion until
mid-1975. To meet growing phosplhate fertilizer requirements EPIDC completed
in 1969 and 1970 two triple superphosphate (TSP) plants of 32,000 and 120,000
TPY capacity respectively at Chittagong, based on imported rock phosphate
and sulfur since the country does not have reserves of its own. However,
TSP trial production has just recently started on one plant, and the second
unit will commence trial production in February 1975 upon delivery of suit-
able Florida phosphate rock.
2.02      A description of the past performance of BFCPC's fertilizer enter-
prises and the steps being taken for improving their operations is given in
Annex 2-1. The Government has agreed to use its best efforts to take all
actions required to improve the p:-oduction of the existing fertilizer plants
at Chorasal, Chittagong and Fench iganj, taking into account the recommendations
made by the Tennessee Valley Auth;,rity (TVA) as part of its fertilizer marketing
- distribution study (para 3.11).  IDA will be consulted and will Z'ollow
progress in this regard. In addi':ion, the Government has agreed to employ a
consultant to assist BFCPC in establishing a uniform system of inventory
control for spare parts and raw miterials for all of its fertilizer plants.
Such a system is to be established by June 30, 1976 and should help eliminate
a major cause of present low plani: utilization. As further evidence of positive
action in this area, the Governmenrt has also agreed to allocate adequate
foreign exchange for spare parts znd raw materials, and IDA's Third Imports
Credit (Credit No. 515-BD) provides some financing for imports of spare parts,
sulfur and phosphate rock during fiscal year 1974/75.  With specifc reference
to the Chorasal plant, in 1972, tf.e Government engaged the servicec of Toyo
Engineering (Japan) to repair and rehabilitate the factory, and its problems
identified by Toyo, were to be corrected during the plant's first Echeduled
maintenance overhaul in 1974; but, as mentioned in the previous paragraph,
in the Fall of that year Ghorasal had to be shut down.  On the strength of
arrangements made in Japan for the supply of replacement equipment, BFCPC
hopes now to have the plant back in operation in May 1975, when it is expected
to operate close to full capacity. The Government is also considering
proposals to rebuild the Fenchuganj plant with foreign assistance; hlowever,
since the factory is nearing the ead of its useful life the extent of such
rehabilitation will first require careful study.
2.03      After the war of indeoenience BFCPC was established under the Bang-
ladesh Industrial Enterprises (Nationalization) Order of 1972 to "control,
supervise and coordinate" enterpr±3es established in the chemical anid pharma-
ceutical fields by EPIDC.  In add-:ion to the fertilizer plants referred to
in the two preceding paragraphs, al3out 48 enterprises, some abandorned by



-3-
their previous Pakistani owners, have been put under BFCPC's umbrella. A
brief description of BFCPC 's present status, functions and performance is
given in Annex 2-2.
B.   Corporate Structure and Ownership
2.04      Since BFCPC is already responsible for a large number of enterprises
and the proposed project will be a major unidertaking, the Government decided
ithat the project will be carried out by a new company, the Ashuganj Fertilizer
and Chemical Company Ltd. (AFCC), which was established October 16, 1974
under the Company's Act of 1913. Until the new company is adequately staffed
and becomes operational BFCPC will continue to act for it in further project
preparation and implementation with a full transfer of responsibilities and
commitments to be completed by mid-1975. However, BFCPC will transfer to
AFCC all rights and obligations relative to the land for the plant site7
the site development contract (para 4.09) and BFCPC's existing contract covering
the provision of technical advisory services for the project (para 2.06)
before the IDA credit becomes effective. Once the new company is fully
equipped to manage its affairs, BFCPC will restrict itself to the supervisory
and coordinating functions assigned to it under the 1972 Nationalization
Order, to be exercised through its nominees on the Board of DIrectors.  The
Government confirmed during negotiations its intention that BFCPC will have
a minority representation on the Board of Directors.  The Government will be
the sole shareholder of AFCC. The authorized share capital is Tk 1 billion
(Tk 100 crores) equivalent to US$134 million. Paid up capital (some US$107
million) will be represented by the Governiment's contributions to the cost
of the project, for which AFCC will issue shares to the Government.
C.   Organization and Management
2.05      The Company will have a Board of Directors of not less than three
and not miore than seven members, including the Chairman, all of whom will
be nominated by the Government but two of these shall be proposed to the
Government by B?CPC. Initially, a five member board is planned. The Directors,
with the exception of the Managing Director, will have no executive functions.
BFCPC has proposed a Chairman (the present BFCPC Chairman) and one Director,
and the Government has nominated two more Directors. The Managing Director
will be the Chief Executive of the Company. The Government has nominated
Mr. Momahad Yusuf, formerly the Member for Technology in the Bangladesh Atomic
Energy Commission, for thiis position. Mr. Yusuf has an engineering background
and about 22 years experience including power project management. The lenders
had an opportunity to review this nomination. The Government has also agreed
to consult with the lenders on the appointment of the Chairman and the
Managing Director should a vacancy occur in these positions; the same pro-
cedure would apply to the appointment of the Plant Manager and the Chief
Financial Officer of AFCC. The Company's Articles of Association has been
registered and is satisfactory; it gives the Company sufficient authority
to manage its affairs and operate the plant in keeping with sound business
prCnciples. Tt was further agreed that the by-laws and regulations of AFCC
will be submitted to the lenders for clearance prior to adoption and any



-4-
subsequent changes which could materially affect the operations of the
Company will require approval of the lenders.
2.06.     Following IDA guideLines, BFCPC in December 1973, selected a
Technical Advisor for the project consisting of a joint venture of the
Scientific Design Company Ltd. (UK) and James Chemical Engineering (US)
which is presently helping to organize a project team to implement the
project.  The team will subsequently be transferred to AFCC and on comple-
tion of the project assume plant operating functions.
2.07      Substantial outside assistance will be needed during the implemen-
tation phase and the early years of operation and expatriates will assume
in-line responsibility under the general direction of AFCC's Board of
Directors to achieve capacity output in the shortest possible time and to
maintain it thereafter. The scope and role of such management assistance
both during project implementation and initial operations has been agreed
in principle with the Government and the Company. Funds have been included
in the project cost estimate t:o pay for such assistance. Details are given
in para. 4.05.
III. FERTILIZER DEMAND, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
3.01      Fertilizer use in Bangladesh has grown rapidly.  Annex 3-1, dis-
cusses the agricultural sector and the role fertilizer plays in Bangladesh's
agricultural strategy. Annex 3-2 provides historical consumption and supply
data as well as a comparison of fertilizer use in Bangladesh with that in
other countries. Annex 3-3 describes the present system for marketing and
distribution of fertilizers. The following paragraphs summarize the major
findings of these Annexes.
A.  Past Fertilizer Use
3.02      The following table shows the historical development of fertilizer
consumption, local supply and imports in Bangladesh since 1963/64.

The above table indicates the rapid growth of fertilizer use in Bangladesh
increasing from 47,900 nutrient tons in 1963/64 to 143,200 tons in 1970/71,
or by about 17% per year. The 1971 war led to disruption of both local pro-
duction and imports causing consumption to drop significantly, but in 1972/73
local production and consumption picked up sharply despite the scarcity and
significant rise in the local price of fertilizer. While the sharp increase
in local production of urea in 1972/73 allowed a major reduction in import
dependence, overall nutrient imports in that year still accounted for more
than half of consumption, and total available nitrogen production capacity
in Bangladesh was only utilized at about 45%. With the exception of relatively
small amounts of ammonium sulphate local production is in the form of urea.
The table also shows that production of nitrogen fertilizer has been rather
erratic and although highest in 1973/74 could not meet demand which, due to
a Government decision not to import urea, was artificially depressed.
3.03      The rapid recovery of fertilizer consumption in 1972/73 -- which
occurred in spite of the disruptions caused by the war, a severe drought
and the overall poverty of the farmers -- indicates the strength and resili-
ence of fertilizer demand. High and rising prices for rice and the spread
of high-yielding, fertilizer-responsive rice crops have contributed to the
growth of fertilizer demand, which was particularly strong in such progres-
sive agricultural areas, as Chittagong, Comilla, Dacca, and Kishorganj where
the use of these varieties has spread most rapidly. Urea is particularly



- 6 -
suitable for application on high--yielding rice varieties, not only for
agronomical reasons but also on account of its high analysis and the resulting
lower transport costs.
3.04      Although the farmers irL Bangladesh are increasingly aware of the
advantages of fertilizers and have augmented their use dramatically, they
still use only about 19 kg. of nuatrient per hectare of arable land.  This
dosage is on a par with other countries in the sub-continent, but is not
only very low considering the cropping intensity, water availability and
the levels of fertilizer use which would provide optimal yields but also
represents a mere 28% of the world average. It appears that neither the
lack of adequate agricultural credit institutions nor the small size of
farms have prevented fertilizer demand from growing even faster but that
adequacy of supply has been the major limiting factor, particularly in
recent years. Thus, while official prices of fertilizer at the farm level
have more than doubled (for urea from Tk 536 (US$71.5) per ton in 1972/73
to Tk 804 (US$107) in July 1973 to Tk 1,341 (US$179) in April 1974), there
were widespread reports of a fertilizer black market in 1973 and 1974 charging
two to three times the official price. Also a nationwide agricultural survey
in 1967/68 indicated that farmers with less than 2.5 acres used 35% more
fertilizer per acre than did farmers with larger farms. While up to date
figures are not available, indicaltions are that this is still so today.
B.   Forecast of Fertilizer Demand
3.05      The growth of fertilizer demand in Bangladesh will both determine,
and be determined by, the pace and structure of agricultural development in
Bangladesh. As described in Annex 3-1, the most promising opportunities for
increasing agricultural output over the next five to ten years lie in the
spread of high-yielding crop varieties and complementary inputs, particularly
fertilizer. An IDA financed Cereal Seeds Project (410-BD of June 29, 1973)
is expected to accelerate the ava-ilability and wider use of new rice and
wheat varieties.  Detailed fertil:Lzer demand projections through 1982/83 have
been prepared based on present farming practices, probable increases in ir-
rigated and rainfed areas, expected pricing policy (for agricultural inputs
and crops), and improvement in marketing and distribution during the forecast
period. The details and underlyirLg assumptions are given in Annex 3-2, and
are summarized below for urea, together with projections of local production.
These demand projections were prepared as part of the recent Basic Economic
Report on Bangladesh 1/ by an agrcnomist with long experience in the country's
agriculture.  Nevertheless, all such projections depend on a wide range of
interdependent assumptions and should be treated more as an indication of
the probable orders of magnitude involved rather than as precise predictions.

3.06      The projections imply that demand for urea would grow at an average
of about 12.3% a year over 1972/73, as compared with an actual annual consump-
tion growth of 15.4% over the past ten years. Accounting for anticipated
shutdowns of the two existing urea plants for extensive overhauling in 1974/
75, including repairs necessitated by the explosion in the Ghorasal plant
(para 2.01), and assuming 80% capacity utilization of these plants in
subsequent years, local demand will exceed local production until 1978/79,
the first year of production for the proposed Ashuganj plant (the Project).
There will then be about four years of modest surplus production before de-
mand again would exceed local supply, assuming that the project operates at
90% of installed capacity from 1980/81 onward.
3.07      No difficulty is expected in selling any such modest temporary
surplus on the world market. Since natural gas is now substantially cheaper
than other feedstocks for the production of nitrogen fertilizer, Bangladesh
should be able to export urea at prices both competitive and profitable.
India would be the most likely export market, given Bangladesh's proximity
and given the projected gap in India between local nitrogen fertilizer pro-
duction and demand. The Government, based on a feasibility study jointly
undertaken by BFCPC and the Fertilizer Corporation of India, is presently
pursuing plans to establish another ammonia/urea plant of similar capacity,
whose output India is prepared to take. However, even assuming that this
project would proceed without delay, India's gap between supply and demand
is expected to exceed one million tons of urea in 1979, so that there should
be no problem exporting whatever surplus urea Bangladesh can make available
to India alone.

C.   Marketing, Fertilizer Pricing and Distribution
3.08      Annex 3-3 describes in detail the system of marketing and distri-
bution of fertilizers, fertilizer pricing policy and the related subjects
of sales promotion, extension services and credit. The Bangladesh Agricul-
tural Development Corporation (BADC), a public sector corporation responsible
to the Ministry of Agriculture, procures (either locally or by import) and
distributes nearly all fertilizer used in Bangladesh down to the Thana
(county) level. 1/ There fertilizer is purchased either by one of the
29,000 private licensed retail dealers or, in the case of 62 of the 413
Thanas, by the Thana Central Cooperative Association (TCCA), which acts as
a wholesale agent and resells :he fertilizer either to its member village
cooperatives or to private retail agents.
3.09      Considering the inher:ent difficulties of transportation in Bangla-
desh, this fertilizer distribution system has worked rather well in the past.
It has proven flexible enough t:o handle the substantial expansion in fer-
tilizer use over the last decade. It has also, through the vast network of
small dealers, brought fertili::er to within the reach of virtually every
farmer in Bangladesh. The dealers as a matter of course sell fertilizer in
minute quantities -- often only a few kilograms at a time -- so that a
farmer can buy the precise amotut he wants and can afford. This is an
important advantage in a land cf small farms.
3.10      During the past few years, however, due to the rapid increase in
volume, price distortions, disruption of the transportation system and
severe general fertilizer shortages, the system has shown faults and attracted
increasing criticism. Many factors are involved in this. The difference
between the Indian and Bangladesh fertilizer prices -- Indian prices are
considerably higher -- has provided a strong incentive for smuggling and
for reasons mentioned previously (para 3.04) an active black market in
fertilizer has emerged. There also appear to be weak links within the
distribution system itself. As a consequence of all these factors, farmers
frequently complain that fertilizers are not available to the extent and
when they want them.
3.11      These problems, combined with the need to develop a system capable
of distributing much greater quantities of fertilizer in the future, have
led the Government to undertake a comprehensive fertilizer marketing and
distribution study. The main objective of the study is to propose insti-
tutional, organizational and policy improvements and to identify investment
needs in fertilizer distribution and marketing. The first phase of this
study, carried out by TVA and financed by USAID, began in April 1974
with the scope of work formulated in consultation with IDA. The TVA final
1/   The only exceptions are small amounts of fertilizer distributed to tea
estates and sugar mill estates by the Bangladesh Tea Association and
the Bangladesh Sugar Mills Corporation.



-9-
report is expected early 1975. IDA, in consultation with the Govern-
ment is formulating detailed terms of reference for the study's second phase
to be completed by late 1975, which would in turn develop necessary projects
in the fields of distribution and marketing, suitable for financing by an
external lender. Agreement on the scope and detail of the second phase of
the marketing-distribution study is a condition of credit effectiveness.
Among the objectives of the studies are the preparation of detailed area-wise
demand projections, analysis of bagging and handling methods, assessment of
storage needs, as well as review of transportation requirements, making use
of the recent Bangladesh Transport Survey, undertaken with assistance from
the UK Government. Financing of the foreign exchange cost of the study's
second phase is being arranged with a request from the Government to utilize
part of the IDA Technical Assistance Credit (Credit No. 409 BD).
3.12      The study will also review fertilizer pricing policy.  As de-
scribed in Annex 3-3, fertilizers for years have been sold to farmers at
heavily subsidized prices, primarily to promote their use. Recognizing
that farmers are now aware of the advantages of fertilizer and that demand
for fertilizer is strong, and concerned about the Government's financial
resource situation and about reports that the farmers with larger farms
benefitted more from the subsidies than smaller farmholders, the first
Five-Year Plan (1973/74-1977/78) called for a phased reduction in subsidies.
The soaring costs of imported fertilizer following publication of the Plan
added another dimension to the problem and prompted the Government to raise
fertilizer prices sharply (para 3.04). The present pricing structure no
longer subsidizes the sale of locally produced urea. Prices of imported
fertilizers, on the other hand, are still subsidized in varying degrees,
but the subsidy is likely to be eliminated or substantially reduced as
world market prices for fertilizer return to more normal levels after the
next several years and as the Government continues to carry out its policy,
which was reiterated during negotiations, of a phased reduction of subsidies.
3.13      The fertilizer marketing and distribution study will also investi-
gate the area of sales promotion in its broadest sense, including extension
services and credit. As fertilizer supplies come into better balance with
demand, the present sellers' market situation is likely to change. In addi-
tion, as farmers move somewhat closer to optimal fertilizer dosages they
will require more accurate information on fertilizer use and its effect on
various crops. This would suggest an increasingly important role for ex-
tension and demonstration activities in the future. While these activities
(Annex 3-3), are now inadequate, the Government, together with an FAO/IBRD
cooperative program team is working on the preparation of a Rural Development
Education and Training Project, for possible financing by IDA, which could
constitute an important first step in the long range improvement of extension
and farmer training.
3.14      An effective system of agricultural credit, capable of providing
farmers with timely finance on reasonable terms, could ease the financial
burden to farmers of increasingly intensive fertilizer use. As discussed
in the recent Bank Economic Report on Bangladesh (IBRD No. 455-BD) and in



- 10 -
Annex 3-3, the agricultural credit institutions in the country now suffer
from serious weaknesses. There 1las been a dialogue between the Government
and IDA on ways and means for improving these institutions, but it is
clear that efforts to improve the system of agricultural credit in Bangladesh
will require careful development and will need time. The fertilizer demand
projections have taken into consideration the limitations of the existing
credit system, and lack of farmer credit is therefore not expected to hold
demand below projected levels. Government credit now plays a very limited
role in fertilizer purchase since only about 15% of farmers' borrowings come
from government sources. Moreover, only a small part of a farmer's borrowings
is used for purchasing fertilizer and only a fraction of all fertilizer sales
are financed by credit. Limited reliance on existing credit sources, combined
with growing use of high-yielding varieties and continued profitable rice
prices, should enable demand to expand at the rate projected.
3.15      The Government has agreed to review the findings of the first and
second phases of the fertilizer marketing and distribution study with the
lenders and promptly take the necessary action to eliminate physical and
institutional constraints which may arise as the volume of fertilizer to
be distributed grows. This review should provide the basis for an understanding
between the Government and the lenders on the content and the objective of
the anticipated marketing and distribution project and permit completion of
such project within the overall time frame of the proposed Ashuganj urea
manufacturing project.
IV. IHE PROJECT
A.  Project Scope
4.01      The project will be located at Ashuganj some 60 km northeast of
Dacca and will consist of a 1,600 TPD urea plant with an intermediate ammonia
production plant of 925 TPD, and all necessary ancillary facilities. The
ammonia plant will be a single train unit and the urea plant will also be
single train if future bids prove this to be the most economic design. On
the basis of 330 on-stream days per year the plant will have annual capacities
of approximately 528,000 tons urea and 305,000 tons ammonia. These are
standard size capacities and the project will employ modern commercially
proven technology to ensure efficient operation. The production processes
selected and the plant facilities provided are described in Annexes 4-1 and
4-2. The site area is about 130 acres of which 65 acres will be occupied by
the plant, leaving another 65 acres for a housing compound for the employees
and common facilities. The site is on the eastern bank of the Meghna River
and has good rail and water connections. The town of Bhairab Bazaar and the
Ashunganj power station are nearby (Annex 4-3, IBRD Map 11075).
B.   Raw Materials and Utilities
4.02      The principal raw material will be natural gas supplied from the
existing Titas field, some 12 km from the project site. The Bangladesh



- 11 -
Shell Oil Company Ltd., which is 25% owned by the Government, operates the
fi ld and has determined the total reserves at about 63 billion cubic meters
(m ). Details of the gas reserves for the major gasfields in Bangladesh
including Titas, and gas analyses are given in Annex 4-4. The gas is es-
pecially suitable for amnonia production containing some 97% methane with
negligible amounts of sulfur. The gas offtake projections for the Titas
field are shown in Annex 4-5. Even assuming that gas demand would con-
tinue to increase at about 11% per year predicted for the remainder of the
decade, the Titas gas reserves would last for more than 30 years.
4.03      An existing high pressure gas transmission line operated by the
Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Company Ltd. (TGTDC), a wholly
Government-owned entity, passes within about 2 km of the project site and
presently has an unused capacity of some 2.6 million cubic meters per day
(m3PD) or more than double the project's requirements. Prior to the pro-
posed credit becoming effective, the Government will ensure that a satis-
factory quantity of gas (approximately 8 billion m3) from the Titas field
will be dedicated to the project, and AFCC will enter into a long term gas
supply contract with TGTDC on terms and conditions satisfactory to the
lenders. The contract will obligate TGTDC to construct a gas pipeline to
the factory perimeter.
4.04      The nearby Ashuganj power station operated by the Power Develop-
ment Board (PDB) has adequate capacity to serve the project; however, a
study is now being made by AFCC's Technical Advisors (para 4.07) to determine
whether greater reliability and improved economies may be achieved by in-
cluding an on-site power generation facility in the project.  In the meantime
provision has been made in the project cost estimate for inclusion of such
facility. In the event that an on-site power plant is not included in the
project, AFCC will enter into a contract with the PDB for the supply of
power, to be satisfactory to the lenders, prior to December 31, 1975. Water
for industrial and drinking purposes, will be obtained from the Meghna River.
The supply of all utilities is thus satisfactorily assured.
C.   Employment, Training and Management Assistance
4.05      The project will provide employment for about 1,200 persons.  Of
these some 525 will be key technical, maintenance and operational personnel
distributed over ammonia production (116), urea production (112), maintenance
department (260), and laboratory (37). This complement of key personnel will
be developed during the project's construction period by drawing where
possible suitable individuals from within the BFCPC enterprises, particularly
the four existing fertilizer works, and training them to the specific re-
quirements of the project. The training programs will initially be devised
by AFCC's Technical Advisor in close cooperation with the Engineering Firm
for the project (para 4.07) and include intensive training abroad for selected
staff in plants of similar type. It will be the responsibility of the Engi-
neering Firm (para 4.08) to make the necessary arrangements for this foreign
training. Additionally, a team of expatriate experts will be appointed by
AFCC to assist with the administrative and general supervision of the Company



- 12 -
during the construction stage of the project and during the first 2 or 3
years of commercial production. This management assistance will also
include training of the Company's Bengalee management and technical staff.
An amount of US$6.6 million foreign exchange to cover its cost has been
included in the project cost estimate and the general scope of services
to be provided is outlited in Arnex 4-6.  Prior to credit effectiveness,
AFCC will make arrangements, including an implementation plan satisfactory
to the lenders, to obtain the services of experts to fill advisory, technical
and managerial positions within the Company for which qualified Bengalees are
not available and to train Bengalees to fill such positions. AFCC is
soliciting proposals for these services in accordance with IDA Guidelines.
D.   Ecology
4.06      There are presently no statutory regulations in Bangladesh for
industrial effluents, and the project will be consequently designed in ac-
cordance with European and U.S. standards in respect to solid, liquid and
gaseous emissions. As the natural gas from the Titas field to be used
as raw material and fuel is virtually sulfur free, atmospheric pollution
problems are expected to be minimal. Liquid effluent from the plant will
be treated in waste water treatment units prior to discharge into the Meghna
River, and, under these circumstances, the adverse effect of the project on
the environment is expected to be negligible. Pollution control facilities
forming about 2% of project costs are satisfactory.
E.   Project Execution
4.07      The groups responsible for project execution will be (a) the
Company (AFCC) which will be the owner and executing authority and which
will include (b) the Management Assistance Team whose members will assume
line positions within AFCC; (c) the Technical Advisor already selected
(para 2.06), who will act as Consultant to AFCC throughout the course of
the project from preparation of specifications and tender documents to
final acceptance of the complete plant and (d) the Engineering Firm who
will contract with AFCC for the fsupply of the complete plant on a turnkey
responsibility basis. Bids are b,eing sought on a fixed price basis for
provision of process licenses and all services, with all equipment,
materials, freight and construction costs being reimbursable at cost.
The initial services of the Technical Advisor up to the date the IDA credit
becomes effective which is expect:ed to follow shortly after award of the
Engineering Firm contract is being financed by part of the US$4.0 million
IDA Technical Assistance Credit RCredit No. 409 BD) which was approved by
the Executive Directors on June 28, 1973. US$400,000 has been appropriated
to cover this period. There is no plan for refinancing of this upon approval
of the project credit.
4.08      The Engineering Firm wlll have full responsibility for imple-
menting the project, including the provision of process licenses, basic
and detailed engineering and the management of procurement, construction,
start-up and commissioning. Inv:itations to bid for the Engineering Firm



- 13 -
contract have been issued to four firms which have been prequalified in
accordance with the Association's-Guidelines and bids are expected by
February 1975. Equipment and materials procurement will be conducted from
the Engineering Firm's offices with participation by AFCC and its Technical
Advisor. The project-completion date, which is defined as the date of
acceptance of the total plant after successful completion of all performance
tests, is scheduled for the end of July 1978, as shown in Annex 4-7. 1/
4.09      Detailed civil engineering design will be undertaken by the
Engineering Firm and civil construction by local contractors or by local
labor directly hired by the Engineering Firm who will supervise the work
in either case.  The plant will be designed to withstand winds of
typhoon velocity which are common in Bangladesh. Preparatory survey and
engineering work has been undertaken by a competent and experienced local
consulting engineering firm and the contract for dredging and filling the
site has been awarded to a US firm after international competitive bid-
ding. The site will be filled and raised by an average of 20 feet which
would protect the plant from the seasonal monsoon-floods. Plant erection
will be undertaken mainly by local labor directly hired by the Engineering
Firm supplemented by skilled expatriate labor as required. AFCC will form
a project team from its own staff and that of the Management Assistance Firm
to oversee the construction of the plant and all ancillary facilities.
V. CAPITAL COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN
A.  Capital Costs
5.01      The total project cost is estimated at USS249.4 million including
US$142.3 million foreign exchange cost of which US$0.4 million has already
been provided from an IDA technical assistance credit (para 4.07). The
financing still required therefore is US$249.0 million of which US$141.9
million is foreign exchange. The estimate is summarized on the following
page and shown in more detail in Annex 5-1. This estimate initially was
prepared jointly by the project's Technical Advisor and the IDA appraisal
mission but is now based on price levels prevailing in September 1974; it
takes account of equipment price increases in major supplying countries due
to the worldwide inflation and equipment supply shortage. Physical
contingencies provided are 9.6% 2/ for both local and foreign base cost
1/   To meet that date, the Government has appropriated US$4 million foreign
exchange necessary to commence site dredging work in advance of the
effective date of the credit. This amount would be retroactively fi-
nanced by USAID from its loan for the project and to a lesser extent
by IDA (para 5.07).
2/   Includes cost of bag making plant and on-site power plant which may
or may not be included in the project.

estimates (BCE) and are based on the detailed contingency schedule included
in Annex 5-1. Price escalation provided is 30% and 17% of local and foreign
BCE and physical contingencies respectively. Escalation rates for equipment
have been taken at 14% for 1974, 11% for 1975 and 7.5% for 1976 onward, and
for civil works at 18% for 1974, 15% for 1975 and 12% for 1976 onward, all
as detailed in Annex 5-1. These rates are considered reasonable because the
basic estimate being founded on September 1974 price levels already includes
a substantial price escalation component attributable to scarcity factors.
Ordering of equipment is expected to commence by the fourth quarter of 1975 1/
and to be substantially completed by the third quarter of 1976. Import duty
at an average rate of 40% has been allowed. The estimate assumes a project
implementation period of 52 months, inclusive of 4 months testing and
commissioning, dating from April 1, 1974 when appraisal was undertaken. The
project may be deemed to have commenced, however, in December 1973 with the
appointment of the Technical Advisor.
5.02      Accurate projections of price escalation are very difficult under
current conditions, even more so for equipment for the fertilizer and re-
lated industries which are expanding rapidly throughout the world. Inability
to obtain materials on time, longer delivery periods, or even lack of an ade-
quate response to requests for bids could all lead to higher foreign exchange
costs than estimated. However, to try to provide a reserve against all con-
ceivable levels of price increases would be counter-productive because such
provision, which may prove to be unnecessary, could lead to a loss of re-
sources for other projects in Bangladesh, given the limited annual allocation
of concessional finance by all lenders, and could relax tight cost control.
Consequently, while the above project cost estimates are considered realistic
and are well in excess of previous estimates for similar projects now under
construction, the possibility of a cost increase and the need for additional
financing, though small, cannot be ruled out altogether.
5.03      The initial working capital requirements in addition to the spare
parts and catalysts included in the equipment cost estimate, are estimated
at Tk 96 million with a foreign exchange component of Tk 14 million
(US$1.9 million) as shown in Annex 5-2. The foreign exchange component
is included in the foreign financing package, while the local currency
component will be provided by the Government from its own resources as part
of its equity contribution (as shown in the financing plan).
B.   Financing Plan
5.04      The financing plan for the project provides that the Government's
equity contribution will cover local expenditures while the foreign loans
will cover the estimated foreign currency costs. It is shown below:

/b   This represents part of the IDA Technical Assistance Credit (Credit
No. 409 BD) earmarked for the services of the Technical Advisor up to
credit effectiveness (para 4.07).
To secure full financing for the estimated direct foreign exchange cost, the
IDA credit would become effective after all conditions, other than the
effectiveness of the IDA credit, precedent to the effectiveness of the other
foreign loans, except the GOS loan, have been met and the GOS has signified
its decision to submit its proposed loan to the Swiss Parliament. All the
lenders, with the exception of the GOI and KfW have reached agreement in
principle with the Government on their respective loan agreements. The loan
agreements with the GOI and KfW are expected to be negotiated early in 1975.
The Government's equity contribut:ion will come from duties on imported equipment
and materials Tk 175 million (34.3%), interest during construction Tk 204
million (25.4%) and from the development budget Tk 324 million (40.3%). 1/
Equity financing of the project wi:ll be about 43% and debt financing about
57% which is an acceptable capitalization. In the event that the ratio of
foreign and local costs of the project significantly varies, the Government
will be permitted to inject a portion of the IDA credit as equity or to
extend a portion of local currency as loan as the case may be, to maintain
the debt equity ratio close to, but not in excess of 60/40. Should there
be any cost increase the obligaticn to find the additional funds needed
to complete the project will be with the Government.
1/   The Government's commitment to provide equity has been covered in a draft
Financing Agreement with AFCC, acceptable to the lenders, and annual
provisions for amounts needed will be made in the development budget.



- 17 -
5.05      All foreign loans will be made to the Government on concessional
terms for a weighted average period and interest rate of 39 years and about
1.0% per annum, and will be passed on to the AFCC on the same terms as the
proceeds of the IDA credit (Annex 5-3).  The proceeds of :he IDA credit are
to be extended from the Government to AFCC at 10% effective annual interest
for 15 years including 5 years of grace and equal semi-annual principal pay-
ments with the Company bearing the foreign exchange risk during this period.
The standard rate used by the Government when lending to state-owned enter-
prises is 7-1/4%. In response to the Association's position that no rate
below 10% - the minimum rate currently used for industrial projects - would
be acceptable, the Government and the other lenders agreed to a 10% onlending
rate. With this rate, total interest during construction is estimated at
Tk 204 million (US$27.2 million) as per Annex 5-4, based on the disbursement
schedule set forth in Annex 5-5.
C.  Procurement and Allocation of Foreign Funds
5.06      Approximately 66% of the foreign funds available for the project
will be untied with the balance being tied to procurement in the USA or
developing countries (21%), and the UK (13%). In order to ensure most
economic use of these funds and for ease and speed of administration, the
foreign exchange financing will, in part, be on a parallel basis with
separate specific lists of goods and services being allocated to ADB
(US$30.0 million, partly tied); AID (US$20.7 million, tied) 1/; ODM (US$11.7
million, tied); and KfW (US$12 million, untied). An explanation of the
rationale behind this preallocation and details of the items preallocated
are given in Annex 5-6. The funds of IDA, GOI and GOS (US$51.9 million)
will be used to finance, in accordance with IDA Guidelines, services,
equipment, and the foreign exchange portion of civil works not preallocated
or remaining after tied funds have been exhausted. The imiost likely major
item to fall in this category will be the contract for the Engineering Firm
estimated at US$24.5 million including provision of a bonus for early
completion. It is expected that the remaining tied funds of AID (US$9.3
million) and ODM (US$6.3 million) can be used to finance contracts won by
US or UK suppliers respectively under international competitive bidding
(ICB). However, should it appear that some of the tied funds cannot be
utilized in this manner, then additional equipment and services will be
allocated by IDA, in consultation with the lender with the remaining tied
funds, for procurement through competitive bidding within the territories
acceptable to that lender. With the allocation procedures described above,
it is anticipated that about 83% of the foreign funds will be utilized on
the basis of either ICB or approved international shopping lists. The
allocation of the foreign loan funds would then be as follows:
1/   US$8.1 million of this amount has been allocated for the dredging
contract (para 4.09) which was placed under ICB. Hence, only
US$12.6 million remains as tied funds.

/e   Freight and insurance on ammonia plant equipment (US$3.1 million) and

5.07      There will be preqtulification for all suppliers of equipment and
materials (i.e., independent of the source of finance) and the technical
evaluation will be done by the Engineering Firm and reviewed by the Tech-
nical Advisor (para 4.07 and 4.08). Shipping and insurance will be arranged
by the Engineering Firm in accordance with IDA Guidelines. Although none
of the IDA financed goods are expected to be procured in Bangladesh, pre-
qualified local suppliers would receive for purposes of bid evaluation
a preference of 15% or the amolunt of the customs duty whichever is lower.
Items which are critical, eithLer technically or because of their limited
availability, may be subject to restricted bidding among qualified suppliers
approved by the lender concerned and are expected to total between US$10 and
13 million. Most of these items, however, will be equipment for the ammonia
and urea plants which are either not being financed by IDA or only to a very
minor extent (urea plant). The upper limit of the value of critical items
which may be financed by IDA, therefore, is unlikely to exceed US$3 million.
As to construction services, although significant awards to local construction
firms are not anticipated, such local firms participating in ICB will, for
purposes of bid evaluation, receive a preference of 7-1/2%, and for contracts
won by them in competition with foreign firms, 35% of the contract value
(deemed to be the foreign exchange component) will be eligible for financing
out of unallocated, untied funds including IDA. The aggregate foreign
exchange financing for such local contracts is not expected to exceed US$4
million and will probably be considerably less. It is anticipated that
sub-contracts related to the site dredging and filling work (para 4.09) awarded
after November 1, 1974 but prior to IDA credit effectiveness, amounting to



- 19 -
about US$0.6 million equivalent, will not qualify for USAID financing.
Consequently, retroactive financing by IDA up to US$0.6 million for these
sub-contracts may be necessary. IDA has reached agreement with the other
lenders on the above allocation of goods and services and procurement
procedures as well as on other matters related to project execution such
as coordinated project supervision missions.  Finally, the Governmentts
procedures and regulations relevant to the approval of contracts, the
issuance of import licenses, application of import duties, and inland
transportation to the site are discussed in Annex 5-7. On all these, speedy
action by the Government is essential to avoid project delays and specific
assurances have been received from the Government to this effect.
VI.  FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A.  Financial Analysis of the Project
6.01      The financial analysis is based on a projection of 12 operating
years with the plant depreciated over the same period on a straight line
basis as shown in Annex 6-1, and a gradual buildup from the assumed start
of commercial operations (August 1978) to 90% capacity utilization in the
third operating year (1980). Operating costs and the sales price of urea
are those expected to prevail at plant start-up; they have been kept con-
stant throughout the forecast period. Except for the gas, operating costs
are assumed to be about 40 to 50% higher than those prevailing in 1974 and
the underlying assumptions are shown in Annexes 6-2 and 6-3. The gas con-
tract between AFCC and TGTDC specifies a price of Tk 3.72 (US$0.50) per
MSCF as set by the Government. This is about 60% higher than the recently
revised price to other consumers. 1/ However, the contract price is not
fixed but would change to reflect any changes in the Government's pricing
policy. The price of Tk 3.72 per MSCF is used in the financial projections.
6.02      The Government has agreed to set the ex-factory price at a level
that will provide at least a debt service coverage of 1.5 for the project
and yield a reasonable return on equity. A minimum ex-factory price of
US$155/ton of urea would meet these conditions and has been used in the
financial projections. This price is about 50% higher than the early 1974
ex-factory price for the existing urea plants, but is low relative to the
expected 1978 ex-factory prices that these plants will charge as a result of
rising production costs, especially for spare parts, chemicals and possibly
heavy reconditioning costs.
1/   The gas price was US$0.21 per MSCF during 1973 and was raised to
US$0.31 in mid-1974. The Government sets the gas price and only one
price is used for all users, irrespective of distance transmitted and
volume consumed.

2.   Depreciation Charges                        37.67           46.7
3.   Salaries, Wages, Bonus, Benefits

Charges                                    80.67           100.0
6.04      The capital intensive nature of the project is evident from the
cost structure. Depreciation charges and maintenance materials account for
about 56% of production costs as against 17.2% for natural gas and 7.9% for
labor expenses. This aspect -- where capital charges are very much more
dominant than feedstock costs -- provides some cushion against feedstock
price escalations. The projections assume that urea will be bagged in heavy,
single film bags made by the Company from imported polyethylene chips.
Although international prices for these chips have escalated rapidly during
the recent year, a 60% import tariff on them is primarily responsible for
the high cost of bagging materials.
6.05      It has not yet been firmly decided whether heavy wall plastic
bags or plastic lined jute bags will be used by the project, and a detailed
analysis will be undertaken by the marketing consultants. An estimate of
the cost of producing heavy wall plastic bags (which have been assumed in
the project's production cost estimates) is given in Annex 6-4. Although
the cost of plastic lined jute bags would be considerably higher, their use
could conceivably be justified on the basis of their superior handling
characteristics and the use of locally produced jute. If plastic lined jute
bags or any other alternative is ultimately recommended, the Government has
agreed to increase the ex-factory price of urea to reflect the difference
in bagging costs; this also follows from the debt service criterion for
setting the project's ex-factory price.

/c   Interest, depreciation and net profit
/d   Dividend payments are not assumed in the projections.  Funds in excess
of the minimum working capital requirement as determined by a current
ratio of 1.5 are accumulated in this account.
6.07      The project is expected to incur an operating loss during the first
5 months of operations because of the assumed capacity utilization of 50%,
but should operate profitably from then on. The debt service coverage is
about 1.5 times during the third year as full debt repayment commences and
increases gradually thereafter. The operating cash requirement of the
Company is determined by a minimum current ratio of 1.5 and dividend payments
are not assumed in the projections. The accumulated cash in excess of



- 22 -
working capital requirement is shown as accumulated investable funds. Re-
tained earnings represent less than half of these funds during the first four
operating years but exceeds 502 thereafter. The above table does not assume
any investment of the surplus cash and hence does not include any revenue
from this source. The debt/equity ratio at the end of the first operating
year is estimated at 58:42. The ratio improves rapidly thereafter if no
dividend payments are assumed and less so after the third year if maximum
dividends were paid as shown in Annex 6-5.
6.08      A major portion of gross revenues will be paid out as income taxes
and in the form of debt service. Since in this project the debt service
payments accrue to the Government, its share of gross revenues will be sub-
stantial as shown in the following table:

/a   This is the portion of net profit not needed for working capital purposes.
The maximum dividends assume that there will be no accumulated retained
earnings, but a current ratio of 1.5 will be maintained.
6.09      The financial position of the Company is expected to be satis-
factory and its liquidity position, even in the extreme case that the maxi-
mum dividend distributions are made, will remain favorable and allow the
Company to accumulate about US$21 million by the end of the third operating
year and additional amounts of about US$3.7 million annually thereafter up
to the eleventh year. Annex 6-6 3hows that the profit breakeven capacity
utilization is 61% during the initial five-month period (to allow for
inventory build-up), 58% during th-ie second year and that it declines by
about 2% each year thereafter. The cash breakeven point is initially 34%
but increases to 51% during the third year, as full debt repayments commence,
and declines also by 2% each subsequent year. Annex 6-7 discusses the fi-
nancial analysis in more detail.
6.10      For purposes of interna: rate of return calculation, the capital
costs are converted to mid-1978 constant dollars in Annex 6-8. The fi-
nancial rate of return is 9.2% (1:3.8% before income taxes) at the assumed
ex-factory price of US$155 per tort of urea based on the cashflow streams in



- 23 -
Annex 6-9 and is satisfactory. The return differs by about one percentage
point for each US$15 increase in the urea price. Sensitivity analyses con-
tained in Annex 6-10 and summarized below for three different urea prices
indicate that the rate of return is not very sensitive to moderately adverse
developments involving some assumptions in the financial analysis.

/a   Capacity Utilization:  Year 1-50%; Year 2-60%; Year 3-70%; Year 4-80%;
90% onwards.
6.11      The financial rate of return is low relative to similar projects
for the following reasons: (a) conservative (long) construction period;
(b) high capital costs on account of import duties and infrastructure (site)
development; (c) low ex-factory price; (d) the high corporate tax rate;
(e) the assumption that surplus funds are not reinvested in revenue-earning
assets.
C.   Financial Covenants
6.12      To ensure sound financial management AFCC has agreed to the fol-
lowing covenants: the Company will (a) not incur additional long term debt
if its debt/equity ratio would exceed 60:40 or if its debt service coverage
ratio will fall below 1.5 times at any time; (b) maintain a minimum current
ratio of 1.5:1 with dividend payments or other cash distributions to be
made out of accumulated earnings and subject to the above current ratio
test; and (c) not undertake any capital investment program in excess of
US$3 million equivalent per year during the initial three years of commercial
production without the prior approval of IDA.
D.    Major Risks
6.13      There are major risks involved in the project:  further equipment
price escalation in a strong sellers' market beyond that assumed; delays
in equipment delivery from fully booked suppliers; and most importantly,
construction delays due to administrative inertia and low capacity utilization
due to ineffective management or operating standards as presently experienced
in Bangladesh's existing fertilizer factories. The assumptions on construction



- 24 -
time and capacity use, while reasonable, are predicated on specific procedures
to accelerate Government action on project related requirements and effective
management assistance with major responsibilities in project implementation,
initial production and the financial and administrative functions of the
enterprise to be given to expatr:.ate experts. Lack of such effective
assistance could cost Bangladesh very dearly and is something the country
can not afford. However, as ment:ioned previously the Company and the
Government have agreed in principle on administrative procedures and assistance
arrangements satisfactory to IDA and the other lenders, and the risk is
considered acceptable.
6.14      Commercial risks in the sale and distribution of urea, including
the possible need for some temporary exports, are also present, but these
are considered comparatively mincr, since Bangladesh will have to utilize
most of the project's output if it wants to meet the food requirements of its
rapidly growing population.
VII. ECCNOMIC ANALYSIS
A.  World Fertilizer Prices
7.01      During the late 1960's, world fertilizer prices were depressed
due to excess supply and consequently, investments in new fertilizer capacity
were modest. When demand expanded rapidly during 1972-1973, it was not
matched with increased supply and prices have risen sharply, partly due
to scarcity and partly due to increases in hydrocarbon and phosphate rock
prices, the major raw materials far fertilizer production. Urea fertilizer
prices, for example, are now about US$300 per ton (f.o.b., bagged). Freight
charges, which also constitute a najor portion of imported fertilizer costs,
have also increased sharply. The present world-wide fertilizer shortage
and Bangladesh's severe foreign exchange constraint have made it difficult
for the country to rely on imports to a major extent to meet the growing
domestic demand. With ample and inderutilized natural gas resources,
domestic urea production has emerged as an economically attractive proposition
for Bangladesh.
B.   Economic Analysis
7.02      The economic analysis i;3 based on 1978 economic operating costs 1/
and 1978 urea import price (e.g. c.i.f. Chittagong) of US$170 per ton (bagged).
This is roughly composed of an equivalent f.o.b. (Persian Gulf or Indonesia)
urea price of US$145 per ton plus sea fright of US$25 per ton and is con-
sistent with the forecasts presently used by the Bank in other fertilizer
projects. Local port handling of US$5 per ton is added to arrive at the
economic price of US$175 per ton. No adjustments for inland freight are
1/   Details about the economic p:-oduction costs are given in Annex 6-3.



- 25 -
made since distribution costs from the port of entry and from the plant
site are expected to be of the same order of magnitude. Except after trans-
formation to urea fertilizer, it appears, as discussed in Annex 7-1, that
the natural gas resources of Bangladesh cannot be properly considered an
exportable commodity, either directly or indirectly. Bangladesh will not
import any crude oil or its derivatives to replace the natural gas used for
the project. Furthermore, almost all economically and technically feasible
substitution of gas for oil has already taken place. Assuming gas con-
sumption grows by 11% annually, present reserves will last in excess of
30 years. Consequently, the shadow price of the natural gas is taken to be
identical to the price used in the financial analysis. This yields an
economic price of US$0.50 per MSCF. 1/ Similarly, the labor rate used in
the financial projections is taken as the economic wage rate since most of
the labor employed in the project are skilled personnel and the wage bill
is not a large proportion of production costs. Import duties and interest
during construction are excluded from the capital costs which are converted
to constant mid-1978 dollars in Annex 6-8 for the economic analysis. Finally,
local costs are converted at the official foreign exchange rate of Tk 7.50
per US dollar and a twelve-year operating life is assumed.
C.   Economic Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
7.03      The economic costs and benefit streams for the project are shown
in Annex 7-2; and the economic rate of return and sensitivity analyses in
Annex 7-3. The economic return is 21.2% and the sensitivity analysis shows
that should a shadow exchange rate of Tk 14.0 per US dollar be used to
reflect the scarcity of foreign exchange, the return improves to 25.0%.
On the other hand, if the natural gas shadow price is based on an energy
cost of US$1.40 per million BTU 2/ (equivalent to US$9-10 per barrel of crude
oil), on the assumption that the gas is a tradeable commodity, then the
rate of return falls to 17.8%. It is also sensitive to capital cost increases.
A 20% cost overrun reduces the return by 3.6 percentage points. The rate
of return is still satisfactory even under fairly adverse conditions, as
shown below together with cases when the economic price of urea is US$20 per
ton above and below the assumed price.
1/   Refer to Annex 7-1 for further details.
2/   Since the Titas gas has an average net hearing value of 938 BTU per
MSCF, the shadow price would be US$1.31 per MSCF.

D.   Annual Foreign Exchange Savings and the Efficiency of Import Sub-stitution
7.04      The economic benefits Df the project are primarily in the form of
foreign exchange savings due to efficient import substitution. As shown in
Annex 7-4, when the project reaches 90% capacity utilization by the third full
operating year, the gross annual foreign exchange savings will be about
US$74 million in 1978 dollars, or US$155 per ton of urea produced by the
project based on a CIF price of IJS$170 per ton. This high level of foreign
exchange savings is reflected by the favorable economic rate of return of
21.2%. A -,ore precise indicator of Bangladesh's comparative cost advantage
in the prodwction of urea is the efficiency of import substitution, which as
shown in Ann,x 7-5, is about 0.5 implying that only US$0.50 of domestic
resource cos   are incurred by tile project to save US$1.00 in foreign
exchange.
VI'..  AGREEMENTS
8.01      Prior to or during r.ngctiations, agreements were reached on the
following major issues:
A.   Agreements with the Government
1.   The Government has agreed to use its best efforts to take
all action required to improve the production at the
existing plants, and as part of this program appoint or
cause the appointment of a consultant to assist in
establishing a spare parts inventory control system for
the existing fertilizer plants and will make every effort
to promptly implement tie recommendations arising from the
fertilizer marketing and distribution study (para 2.02);



- 27 -
2.   The Government will consult with the lenders on the
appointments of the Chairman and Managing Director of
AFCC (paras 2.04 and 2.05);
3.   The Government will review the findings of the fertilizer
marketing and distribution study with IDA and the other
lenders to determine ways of improving the marketing and
distribution of fertilizer, and ensure implementation of
the necessary project so identified within the overall time
frame of the Ashuganj urea manufacturing project. Agreement
on the scope and detail of the second phase of this study
is a condition of credit effectiveness (paras 3.11 and 3.15);
4.   The Government will ensure that approximately 8 billion
cubic meters of the natural gas resources of the Titas
field will be dedicated to the project and that a Gas
Purchase Agreement acceptable to the lenders will be entered
into between the AFCC and the TGTDC prior to credit effective-
ness. In particular, the Government will ensure that TGTDC
will construct in time as required by the project a gas
pipeline from the existing mainline to the AFCC factory
premises (para 4.03);
5.   The Government will provide equity funds to AFCC in time as
required by the project so that a minimum of 40% equity
participation is attained. In the event the local currency
cost of the project is less than 40% of the project cost,
the Government will invest part of the IDA credit as
equity to raise the equity participation to 40%. Should a
cost increase occur, the Government will provide the funds
needed to complete the project. The availability of the
other foreign loans is a condition of credit effectiveness
(para 5.04);
6.   The Government will relend all the proceeds of the foreign
loans to AFCC at a rate of 10% per annum, for 15 years
(starting December, 1974), including a 5 year grace period.
The Company will bear the foreign exchange risk (para 5.05);
7.   The Government will ensure prompt issuance of permits and
licenses, prompt customs clearance for imported project
material, the provision of sufficient inland transport facilities,
and the expeditious review and approval of project related
contracts where such Governmental approval is required
(para 5.07); and
8.   The Government will set the ex-factory price of urea (or
any other product of the Company) at a level sufficient to
allow AFCC to earn a reasonable return on equity, and
maintain a current ratio of 1.5:1 and a debt service coverage of
at least 1.5 times (paras 6.02 and 6.12).



- 28 -
B.   Agreements with AFCC or B1FCPC on Behalf of AFCC
1.   BFCPC will act for A1'CC in project implementation until
transfer to AFCC of p,roject responsibilities, assets and
commitments are completed. BFCPC shall transfer to AFCC
all rights and obligations relative to the plant site,
the site development contract and the Technical Advisor's
contract prior to credit effectiveness (para 2.04);
2.   AFCC will consult with the lenders prior to appointing
the Plant Manager and the Chief Financial Officer of the
Company (para 2.05);
3.   AFCC will enter into a Gas Purchase Agreement contract
with TGTDC on terms and conditions acceptable to the lenders
prior to credit effectiveness (para 4.03);
4.   If an on-site power pLant is not included in the project, AFCC
will contract with th- Power Development Board (PDB) by
December 31, 1975 for supply of power on terms and conditions
acceptable to the lenders (para 4.04);
5.   Prior to credit effect:iveness, AFCC will make arrangements
to contract for management assistance during project
implementation and during the initial years of operation.
This contract and the whole training and operational
assistance program will be subject to the approval of the
lenders (paras 2.07 arnd 4.05); and
6.   AFCC will observe pruclent financial management and observe
the financial covenants contained in para 6.12.
8.02      An agreement on procuiement and the use of loan funds was reached
with the Government and the lenders (para 5.06).
8.03      Based on the above agreements, the project is suitable for an
IDA credit of US$33 million equivalent.

Anhydrous Ammonia. (NH3) A gas containing approximately 82% nitrogen.
Under pressure, ammonia gas is changed to a liquid and is usually stored
and transported in this form. Anhydrous ammonia is used to make most of
the solid forms of nitrogenous fertilizers and also is used for direct
application to the soil either as a gas or in the form of aqua ammonia.
Biuret.  An impurity, NH(CONH2)2H20 found in commercial urea, brougnt aboat
by a partial decomposition of tie urea to biuret and ammonma. For certain
applications, particularly when the urea is ultimately sprayed on citrus
trees, the biuret content should be kept as low as possible, in the range
0.1 to 0.3 wt. %.
Bulk Fertilizer. The term bulk fertilizer can be taken to mean commercial
fertilizer delivered to the purchaser, either in the solid or liquid state,
in a nonpackaged form to which a label cannot be attached.
Calorific Value. A measure of the quantity of heat given out in the
combustion of a fuel. Usually expressed as BTU/standard cubic foot in
the case of a pipeline gas, where the standard cubic foot of gas is
measured at 14.7 lb/sq.inch absolute pressure and 600 F. teMperature
and in the dry state. A BTU is the amount of heat required to raise
1 pound of water through 1 fahrenheit degree at 600 fahrenheit. The
calorific value may be expressed either as gross or net. The gross value
is obtained when the water vapourin the combustion products is condensed
and the net when it remains as vapour.
Fertilizer. Any natural or manufactured materLal added to the soil in
order to supply one or more plant nutrients.

Giammarco Vetrocoke. Proprietary name of patented carbon dioxide scrub-
bing process using hot potassium carbonate solution as the solvent but
with the addition of small amounts of arsenious oxide to inhibit corrosion.
One of the most efficient carbon dioxide removal processes but it suffers
from the disadvantage of employing highly poisonous arsenic compound.
Monoethanolamine. An organic solvent made from ethanol and ammonia which
has a high solubility for carbon dioxide and which can be easily regenerated.
Widely used in carbon dioxide scrubbing processes particularly in cases of
small to medium scale operation.
Nitrogen. A colorless, inert gas that makes up about four-fifths of the
air.  Nitrogen for commercial purposes can be "fixed" synthetically from
the air by several processes.
Nutrient (Plant). Any element taken in by a plant, essential to its
growth, and used by it in elaboration of its food and tissue.
Phosphate Rock. Phosphate-bearing ore composed largely of tricalciun
phosphate. Phosphate rock can be treated with strong acids or heat to
make available forms of phosphate. Finely ground rock phosphate is
sometimes used in long-time fertility programs.
Phosphoric Acid. (H3PO). An inorganic acid used in the manufacture of
concentrated calcium phosphates, ammonium phosphates and sometimes for
direct application through irrigation water. Although in fertilizer
terminology the term has been used practically from the inception of the
fertilizer industry to denote t.he available phosphate (P205) equivalent
of a fertilizer, this usage is not strictly correct and has become
particularly confusing in recent years since phosphoric acid H3PO4 is
being used as such in the manuf'acture of fertilizer.
Potash. A terxn used to denoLe the potassium oxide (K20) equivalent of
materials containing potassium. Actually, K20 as such is never found
in fertilizer, but historically the potassium in fertilizer has been
thus expressed.
PPM (Parts per million).  The concentration of a substance expressed as
the number of units of that substance per total million units.



ANNEX 1

Prills. Spherical particles prepared by spraying molten material down-
ward through a countercurrent stream of cooling air; this operation is
performed in a prilling tower. The particles obtained have excellent
storage and handling properties in that they are hard and have less
surface area than crystals.
Primary Elements or Fertilizer Nutrients. The primary plant food elements
are nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. They are called primary or major
elements because of the relatively large quantities needed for healthy
plant growth, and are the most common constituents of commercial fertilizer.
While the plant food elements as such are phosphorous and potassium, in
the fertilizer terminology quantities are expressed in terms of their
oxide equivalents - available phosphate, P205 and potash, K20. Ratio -
The numerical ratio among the concentrations of the primary plant foods
in a fertilizer. For example, a 5-10-15 grade would have a 1:2:3 ratio.
Scrubbing. Process of removing dust and/or vapor from an inert gas
stream by using an absorbing liquid. Always required in fertilizer plants
to remove ammonia, fluorine, and fertilizer dust.
Superphosphate. Made by reacting sulfuric acid and phosphate rock. The
principal source of available phosphate (P205) in fertilizer. There are
two principal kinds --normal or single superphosphate containing 16 to 20%
P205 superphosphate and concentrated superphosphate (also called triple or
treble), containing 40 - 50% P205.
Sulphuric Acid (HpSO),; Oil of Vitriol). This strong acid is made from
various sulphur materials. Sulphuric acid is a common acid, and is used
in the manufacture of fertilizers such as ammonium sulphate and super-
phosphate.
Triple Superphosphate. Made by reacting phosphoric acid and phosphate
rock. A product that contains 40 to 50 percent available phosphoric acid.
Triple superphosphate differs from normal superphosphate in that it contains
very little calcium sulfate.
Urea (CO(NH.) )  A white crystalline material produced synthetically
from ammonia NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) under high pressure.
Commercial urea contains about 46 percent nitrogen. Urea is completely
water-soluble.

BANGLADESH: ASHUGANJ FERTILIZER PROJECT
PAST PERFORMANCE 0F BFCPC FERTILIZER ENTERPRISES
1.        The four major fertiLizer works under the control of the BFC1C
are the Ghorasal urea unit; the two triple superphosphate units at
Chittagong; and the ammoniun sulphate/urea unit at Fenchuganj.
A. The Ghorasal Urea Unit
2.        The Ghorasal urea factory has a rated output o' 1,137 MTD low
biuret urea and was built by the Toyo Engineering Company under Japanese
aid, with the Power Gas Corpora.tion of the UK acting as the Corporation's
technical advisor. The plant is based on total energy recovery centrifugal
compressor type ammonia technology and was completed in mid-1970 and handed
over in September after satisfactorily passing its performance tests. The
plant is made up of a single train ammonia unit of 660 MTD capacity based on
Power Gas'es Methane/Steam reforming process and Toyo's own ammonia synthesis
loop design. Carbon dioxide removal from the reformed gas stream is by the
Giammarco Vetrocoke system but additional carbon dioxide as needed for urea
synthesis is extracted from flue gases using monoethanolamine solution. The
ammonia unit includes a 6,200 KW centrifugal air compressor supplied by IHI
(Japan) driven by a Toshiba steam turbine, a 14,500 KW ammonia synthesis gas
compressor built by Mitsubishi inder license from Clarke (USA), driven by a
Mitsubishi steam turbine, and a 6,600 KW IHI/Toshiba steam turbine driven
centrifugal refrigeration compressor. Also included to supply the full
power requirements of the works are two 8 MW gas turbine alternator sets
with the gas turbines being supplied by Mitsui Shipbuilding and the alternators
by Meidensha Electric Manufactu^ing Company. For emergency power standby two
diesel generators of 500 KW eaclh are provided.  The two 8 MW gas turbine
alternator sets have not fully realized their expected reliability. Conse-
quently plLns are in hand to draw a standby power supply from the grid which
is expected to be shortly boosted by completion of a nearly power station.
3.        The urea unit is basec. on Toyo's own total recycle process and is
basically a single train unit although two urea reactors, two carbamate
pumping streams and two crystallizer units are installed. Carbon dioxide
is supplied from an IHI/Toshiba steam driven booster compressor of 4,000 KW
capacity. The urea unit is reported to have given no trouble in operation.
4.        The plant employs a total of around 1,100 persons and is under the
control of a General Manager assisted by a Factory Manager who directly
supervises the entire works organization which is split into eight depart-
ments -- Operations, Maintenance, Materials Planning, Finished Product
Disposal, Constraction, Administration, Accounts, and Power Supply.  All
labor employed in the works up tD the level of. "Shift Supervisor,"
(employees above this level are called "officers"), is controlled by the
Sramic Federation of which membe:-ship is compulsory at a cost of some Tk 1
per month. The Sramic Federation has its head office in Dacca and covers



ANNEX 2-1
Page 2
the unionization of nine Government Corporations -- Fertilizer, Shipbuilding,
Paper and Board, Food and Allied Industries, Oil and Minerals, Cotton, Sugar,
about half the Jute Corporation, and Shipping. Up till the present time
there are no separate trades unions and all employees of these industries
regardless of their trade belong to the Sramic Federation. The Federation
does not second an official to each industry under its control but instead
recognizes group officials which are appointed by workers in individual
manufacturing units. The labor union is strong and worker demands are
continually being made. In spite of the potentially critical labor sit-
uation, however, the Ghorasal factory has had only one strike since liber-
ation in 1972. This was a 24-hour general strike called by the Sramic
Federation on all industries under its control; during this period, the
Ghorasal works was kept running by its officers.
5.        The performance record of the works since being taken over from the
contractor by the Corporation, however, has been poor.  In October 1970 almost
immediately after "take-over," a crack developed in the Waste Heat Boiler
drain tube necessitating a two months shutdown of the entire works.
Subsequently shortly after the plant was restarted in December 1970, due to
bad control of the boiler feedwater treatment units, silica was deposited
on the steam turbine blades which required a further two months shutdown
of the entire works to permit cleaning and repairs. Shortly after the plant
was restarted after this occurrence, the war of liberation intervened forcing
it to shut down again.
6.        After the war in June 1972 a team of experts from the Toyo
Engineering Company returned to Ghorasal and set about cleaning out and
restoring the plant after its long shutdown and it was restarted in August
1972. Between then and June 1973, however, the plant suffered 10 shutdowns
of varying duration largely as a result of "fail safe" automatic instrumenta-
tion. Due to a lack of confidence in the capabilities of the available
operators, automatic instrumentation had been set to shut down the plant at
the first sign of unsafe or unstable conditions before major damage could
occur, although during this period it has been conceded by the contractors
that some shutdowns were due to incorrectly functioning instruments. However,
with increasing confidence in the operators to detect and correct minor mal-
functions the sensitivity of the automatic shutdown devices has been reduced,
largely eliminating the problem.
7.        In June 1973, however, problems in the auxiliary boiler were
encountered involving several burst superheater tubes and leading to another
lengthy shutdown this time of 90 days' duration. The extraordinary length
of time elapsing before restarting the plant was reported to be due to a lack
of the necessary skilled welders in Bangladesh to make repairs and the
failure, due to administrative bottlenecks, to secure promptly the necessary
technicians from Japan. The plant was finally restarted in August 1973 but
problems with the boiler superheater tubes persisted ultimately requiring
more than 10% of the tubes to be taken out of service thus severely limiting
the output of the plant.
8.        By the early part of 1974 the plant appeared to be capable of running
fairly consistently at an output of about 880 tons/day urea or about 78% of
rated capacity, and a major scheduled overhaul was planned for July 1974 to



ANNEX 2-1
Page 3
take two months. After this it was hoped the plant would be able to achieve
something like its full design output reasonably consistently. However, in
September 1974, during the course of this shutdown a disastrous explosion
occurred in the central control room causing several deaths and injuries.
This occurrence which may have been the result of sabotage is expected to
keep the whole works idle for about one year.
9.        The reasons for the operating history of Ghorasal are hard to pin-
point. Some will be undoubtedly due to imperfection in design and construction,
but the damage caused to the turbines and steam system due to faulty oper-
ation on the initial phase of the plant's life may have been a major contributor.
Mechanical problems, however, were not the only difficulties presently being
encountered in the operation of the Ghorasal works. Lack of spare parts was
becoming an even more critical factor. Due to a severe shortage of foreign
exchange for the purchase of these spare parts, it has been reported that the
suppliers will now only prepare a detailed quotation on receipt of a letter of
assurance that the finance is available for their purchase. It is reported that
such a letter which is issued by the Planning Commission at the request of the
Corporation normally takes about one month. Following presentation of this
letter, a quotation is received wrhich is valid for a limited period usually less
than three months and an order mELde up from the quoted list is then compiled.
Before the order is accepted, however, a letter of credit must be opened which
is reported to take at least three months by which time the offer is invalid
and a new quotation must be sought, requiring the entire procedure to be
repeated.  Again, when spare parts are eventually delivered, clearance from
customs at Chittagong is reported. to take three to four months and from
Dacca Airport, for those parts air-freighted in, between one and two months.
This situation regarding spare parts must be remedied, therefore, if the
Ghorasal works is to achieve consistently high outputs in the foreseeable
future, even after major mechanical problems have largely overcome and the
explosion damage repaired.
B. The Chittagong Triple Superphosphate Units
10.       The two triple superphosphate works of the BFCPC are situated on
the same site fronting the west bank of the Karnaphuli river at the Port of
Chittagong. Raw materials phosphate rock and solid sulphur may be unloaded
at the wharf immediately in front of the works site and conveyed by a short
enclosed belt conveyor directly ilto works storage.
11.       The first of the triple superphosphate units known as TSP-1, was
completed in 1969. Originally, ib had been intended to construct a single
superphosphate works and a bidding competition for such a project had been
won by a U.S. company "Technical Enterprises."  Subsequently, however, it
was decided to change the project to TSP for which French aid funds had
become available. A joint venture French-U.S. company known as "Technique
Chemie" was therefore formed to ececute the project incorporating Technical
Enterprises which would supply the equipment and another company known as
"Pan American" which would do the design. The "Chemico" process for both
sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid was adopted and the design output of the
plant was 100 MTD 98% sulphuric aeid, 32 MTD phosphoric acid as P205, and
106 MTD TSP fertilizer.



ANNE. 2-
Page 4
12.       Attempts were -made to start TSP-1 in 1969 using Jordanian phosphate
rock.  The plant, however, had been designed to use either Moroccan or Florida
rock and could not cope with the high fluoride, chloride and silica content
of the substitute material. Consequently, severe corrosion took place in the
phosphoric acid plant equipment and the works quickly had to be shut down for
repairs. "Technical Enterprises" agreed to supply replacements for the
corroded equipment items and some pieces were received in 1970, but before
the balance of the items were received and the repairs could be effected, the
war intervened. After the war, a new contract was made with Technical Enter-
prises and the remainder of the replacement equipment items was supplied by
the end of 1973.  Installation, however, was delayed because Technical Enter-
prises who were also responsible for this task did not wish to commence work
until such time as the Corporation had secured supplies of suitable phosphate
rock with which to restart the plant.
13.       In this connection the Corporation had entered into a contract
with the International Mining Corporation (IMC) for delivery of Florida
rock in April 1973, but this contract was allowed to lapse due to difficulties
arising from price increases due to the US dollar devaluation and freight
cost increases. Meanwhile a new contract for supply of phosphate rock from
Morocco was made in February 1974 under an arrangement whereby Bangladesh
would make its own shipping provisions. Imports subsequently commenced in
May 1974 under assistance fzem US AID.
14.       Prior to the completion of TSP-1 it was realized that considerably
greater quantities of phosphate fertilizers would be needed and so in 1969
construction of TSP-2 was commenced by Hitachi of Japan on a turnkey basis
financed by Japanese suppliers credits. The design capacity of the plant
was 400 MTD 98% sulphuric acid, 133 MTD phosphoric acid as P20 , and 430 MTD
TSP. Phosphoric acid manufacture was based on the Nissan hemifidrate process
and again required a phosphate rock raw material of limited chloride, fluoride
and silica content.
15.       The plant was completed in November 1970, but Hitachi would not
agree to it being started on Jordanian rock which it was not designed to
process. Consequently, the plant lay idle until the war came in August
1971 when slight damage was sustained. After the war in November another
contract was made with Hitachi to return and repair and recondition the
plant ready for start-up, and this work was in fact completed on time by
March 1973. Following receipt of the first consignments of Moroccan rock
attempts have been made to start the plants, but mechanical problems have
been encountered necessitating lengthy shutdowns.
C.  The Fenchuganj Ammoniam Sulphate/Urea Unit
16.       The first of the Corporation's four existing fertilizer manu-
facturing units was set up at Fenchuganj (about 12 miles south of Sylhet)
in 1961. The plant had a design capacity of 106,000 MTY urea with about
12,000 MTY by product ammoriium sulphate and took its supply of raw material
from the Haripur gas field. This plant was based on conventional recipro-
cating compressor ammonia technology and a partial recycle urea process.
It is reported to have operated satisfactorily over the years 1962 to 1970
achieving an average annual output over the period of 87% of rated capacity.
Although reportedly suiffering no damage it was shut down during the war and
after restarting failed to achieve its previous performance, production



ANNEX 2-1
Page 5
steadily dropping to 35,911 tons urea in the year 1972/73, or about 32%
of rated capacity. It is expected, however, that the works will shortly
undergo a thorough overhaul.
D. Plans for Improving Existing Operations
17.        The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) which is carrying out the
market study referred to in Chapter III of the report has also examined as
part of that study means whereby the performance and output of all these
existing manufacturing units may be improved. In the case of the Fenchuganj
urea plant, modifications to the carbon dioxide removal system, replacement
of some instrumentation, and repairs to the urea reactor  have been ident-
ified as some of the corrective steps which should be undertaken during
the next scheduled plant overhaul.. It is understood BFCPC is considering
these recommindations together w..th a wider rehabilitation plan to be under-
taken with possible foreign finarcing assistance. The TVA also found some
mechnical problems in evidence on the Ghorosal unit but these were already
being tackled with the assistance of the plant* builders, the Toyo Engineering
Company of Japan* The problems were due for correction during the plant's
first scheduled maintenance overhaul in 197h when the control room explosion
occurred. Repairs are now howevetr underway and the plant is expected to
resume production in May 1975.  Ihe TVA noted in the case of the Chittagong
TSP plants that these appeared to be in good order although some mechanical
problems could be anticipated during plant trials due to the plant's long
period of idl*enss, and such did in fact occur as mentioned above. The
larger of the two plants however is now reported to have been in commercial
production since October and the smaller plant is expected to follow early
1975. The TVA team made the additional recommendation in respect to all
existing fertilizer works that assured supplies of spare parts with adequate
inventory control were urgently needed, and consequently pointed to the
desirability of developing an on-site and/or centralized capability for
domestic spare parts manufacture. Meanwhile part of the US$50 million IDA
Industrial Imports Credit III (Credit No. 515BD) is being used to import
spare parts as well as rock phosp:hate and sulphur for the TSP plants in
fiscal year 1974/75.

BANGLADESH - ASHUGANJ FERTILIZER PRuJECT
THE BANGLADESH FERTILIZER CHEMICAL
AND PHARMACEUTICAL CORPORATION
A. Legal Status
1.        The Bangladesh Fertilizer, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Corporation
(BFCPC), is a corporate body with power to acquire, hold and dispose of
property. It was established in March 1972 by the Bangladesh Industrial
Enterprises (Nationalisation) Order 1972, (President's Order No. 27 of 1972).
Pursuant to this Order, the Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh
(the Government) acquired many industrial enterprises and created several
"sector" corporations, including BFCPC, whose function is to control,
supervise and coordinate the activities of those nationalized industrial
enterprises, grouped by sectors, as were placed under each sector corporation
by the 1972 Order and by subsequent Orders. The BFCPC exercises significant
control over the day to day operations of many of the enterprises placed
under it, including fertilizer enterprises. The Government has placed a
total of 52 enterprises under BFCPC, including three fertilizer plants, nine
chemical enterprises and four pharmaceutical enterprises. The fertilizer
plants were taken over from the former East Pakistan Industrial Development
Corporation. The nine chemical enterprises were abandoned by their previous
Pakistani owners. Of the four pharmaceutical enterprises, three represent
joint ventures, two with foreign companies.
2.        The general direction and administration of BFCPC is vested in a
Board of Directors appointed by the Government. The Board is subject to the
supervision and control of the Government and must be guided by instructions
given by ,the Government (usually the Ministry of Industry). The Board
consists of a chairman and not more than six directors. The chairman is the
chief executive of BFCPC.
3.        BFCPC has an authorized share capital of Tk 10 million, subscribed
by the Governme-it of which an initial share capital of Tk 50,000 has been
fully paid. An Annmal Budget Statement must be submitted by BFCPC to the
Government for its approval, following which BFCPC may spend such sums as it
thinks fit on the basis of the Annual Budget Statement. BFCPC can, with the
prior approval of the Government, borrow money, either with or without
security, to discharge its functions.
4.        BFCPC is required to maintain proper accounts, to prepare annual
statements of account (including a profit and loss statement and balance
sheet) and to submit these accounts to audit by two chartered accountants
appointed by the Government. In addition, the Constitution of Bangladesh
requires that BFCPC's accounts be audited by the Government Auditor-General.
5.        The Government may, at its discretion, transfer to BFCPC any
property, assets and liabilities, offices and employees belonging to or
employed by the Government on terms and conditions determined by the
Government.



ANNEX 2-2
Page 2
B. BFCPC Organization
6.        The organization chart; of BFCPC is shown in Chart 1.  At present
there are five board members, including the chairman. The Board of Directors
of BFCPC is an operating board. That is, each board member, including the
chairman, is either the Operating Director (e.g., chief executive officer)
for a group of enterprises or thie Staff Director for a major corporate
staff function. Presently, there is one staff function, finance, under a
Director. The authority of the Director for this staff function cuts
across all the enterprises under BFCPC.  The Finance Director for instance,
has auditing, accounting and firancial authority and responsibility for all
enterprises as well as the corporate accounts. In a sense, therefore, only
the administrative and production authority and responsibility is vested in
an Operating Director.
7.        At the moment, there are four Operating Directors, including the
chairman. Similar enterprises under an Operating Director are grouped into
Divisions, headed by a Senior Executive Officer. For example, the three
existing fertilizer factories (a fourth one has been abandoned) form the
Fertilizer Division. At present, there are seven Operating Divisions.
8.        There are also seven staff divisions, one under the Fertilizer/
Planning Director and three under the Finance Director. The other three,
the Construction, the Purchasing and the Sales Policy Divisions, are
presently under the responsibility of an Operating Director. Presumably,
as the Board is increased to its maximum membership of six, the sixth
Director will have responsibility for one or all of these remaining staff
divisions. Alternatively, there could be some rearrangement of responsibi-
lities among the Operating Directors.
9.        The BFCPC corporate origanization currently has 548 employees, of
which 133 are officers.
10.       Each enterprise or plant is headed by a General Manager who reports
to the Division Senior Executive Officer. The General Manager has administra-
tive and production responsibility for the enterprise. The Chief Accountant
for the enterprise is functionally under the authority of the Accounts
Division (Comptroller) of BFCPC *ihich, in turn, is under the Finance Director.
C. Financial Management
11.       The corporate organization, as well as each enterprise has its own
set of accounts. By law, the corporate accounts must be audited by external
(private) auditors and the Goverrment Auditor-General. In addition, the
internal corporate Audit Divisiorn audits the corporate accounts.
12.       The enterprise accounts are audited by external auditors and by
the corporate Audit Division.



A~EX 2-2
Page 3
13.       For simplicity, the two major accounts of an enterprise will be
considered. These are the Sales or Revenue Account and the Current Account.
All revenue collections, either by the enterprise or by the corporate
Accounts Division on behalf of the enterprise, are deposited into the
enterprise Revenue Account.  However, only the corporate Accounts Division
or Finance Director can authorize the withdrawal of funds from the enterprise
Revenue Account.
14.       The enterprise withdraws funds from its Current Account to meet
its cash payments. This Current Account is replenished by transfers from
the Revenue Account as authorized by the Finance Director or corporate
Accounts Division.
15.       There are very limited investment uses for cash surpluses of an
enterprise. These are (a) short-term bank deposits at about 4% interest,
(b) fixed deposits carrying about 6-7% interest, (c) loans to other BFCPC
enterprises also at about 6% interest, and (d) capital investments such as
plant modernization and staff housing. Loans from one BFCPC enterprise to
another must be approved by the Finance Director and the Chairman of the
Board.
16.       The corporation has an authorized maximum line of credit from the
banking sector of about Tk 50 million.  In addition, it can borrow short-
term funds from the Government. In general, a cash deficient enterprise
can def7r its interest payment obligation on the government equity (or
loan).-
D.  Operating Budgets and Foreign Exchange Allocation
17.       The annual operating budget of the corporate unit is determined
by the Board and approved by the Mlnistry of Industries. The annual
operating budget of the erterprises must be approved by the Board only.
The budget covers both the revenues and expenses (including both foreign
exchange and local currency) associated with the projected level of operations.
The corporation submits its annual foreign exchange requirement (for raw
materials, spare parts or new equipment) to the Government (Ministry of
Industry). The Cabinet decides on the foreign exchange allocations for the
different ministries and government corporations. These foreign exchange
allocations involve both free foreign currency (cash) and aid or grant type
foreign exchange. The foreign exchange allocations are determined every six
months, within the framework of the annual budgets.
18.       The BFCPC corporate entity allocates its own foreign exchange
allocation among the enterprises under its responsibility.
E. Purchasing Procedures2/
19.       For the enterprises that were originally under the defunct
1/ All enterprises, including the corporate unit, pay interest of about
6Ae on the government equity (sometimes treated as loans) in the enter-
prise or corporation.
^>/ Items to be purchased as provided in the operating budget.



ANNEX 2-2
Page L
BID&-/ the procurement of foreign raw materials is the responsibility of
the Corporate Purchasing Division. All enterprises submit their foreign
raw material requirements to the Purchasing Division at least six months
before the materials are needed. Tenders for foreign raw materials are
generally advertised in the locta papers. Thus. local trading firms or
local representatives of foreign firms actually arrange for the foreign
purchase and shipment.
20.       All purchases of loca2 materials and the procurement of spare
parts and equipment are processed by the enterprise. For all types of
procurement, however, (local, foreign by BFCPC or by the enterprise) a
cabinet sub-committee on tenders must approve the recommended winning
bid if the procurement exceeds Tk 100,000. For purchases below this level,
only BFCPC Board approval is reqiired.
21.       The abandoned enterprises acquired by BFCPC have more purchasing
independence. These firms process and evaluate tenders, whether for foreign
or local procurement.  However, Tor purchases exceeding Tk 100,000, the
BFCPC Board must approve the winnMng bid.
F. Personnel Recruitment and Salaries
22.       The general manager of an enterprise has full authority to appoint
factory workers. However, the officers of an enterprise are interviewed
and appointed by a BFCPC interviewing committee. The appointment is made
under the name of the general manager.
23.       Most enterprise employees are paid on a monthly basis.  Thus, the
wages of factory workers are a fixed enterprise cost, rather than a variable
cost. In general, the finished goods handling (loading for shipment) are
contracted on a piece rate basis and is the only piece rate work in a
factory.
2h.       It has been a tradition in the country that employees receive a
one-month salary bonus, in addition to housing, medical and transport
allowances.
25.       To encourage increased plant production, production bonus systems
have been adopted by all enterprises. The scheme generally specifies a
certain percentage of the monthly wage as a bonus for each 1% production above
some minimum level. This minimum level varies among the enterprises,
depending on the vintage of the equipment and similar considerations. These
bonus schemes have been designed so that the traditional monthly bonus has
been worked into the system. Consequently, the minimum output level at
which the bonus computation is based is very low, ranging from 35 to 60% of
rated capacity (generally taken as 300 stream days for continuous process
chemical enterprises). The scheme is also designed so that the equivalent
of 2 months salary is provided as bonus upon reaching 90% to 100% of rated
capacity.

G. The BFCPC Orerhead Allocation
26.       BFCPC charges each enterprise an overhead allocation to cover the
BFCPC administrative expenses. The basis for the overhead allocation charge
is the original installed cost of the existing fixed assets (including all
capital additions) of the enterprise.  Thus, capital intensive and newer
enterprises absorb most of the BFCPC overhead charges. For example, the
Ghorasal Fertilizer Plant overhead allocation represented 1/3 of the Tk 6
million total overhead charges collected by BFCPC for the fiscal year
1972/73.
H. The Financial and Cost Structure of BFCPC
27.       The government equity in BFCPC is Tk 0.5 million while liabilities
to banks and other creditors amount to Tk 5.2 million.  The "retained
earnings" (excess of overhead charges collected from enterprises over
expenses) is Tk 2.1 million. Obviously, overhead charges have exceeded
operating costs.  The Tk 2.1 million represent "profit" for the fiscal year
1972/73.
28.       The current assets of BFCPC represent mostly advances and prepay-
ments of Tk 1.0 million and Tk 0.73 million of cash deposits. The fixed
assets represent Tk 5.5 million of ongoing projects kept as a corporate
account, and Tk 0.52 million of existing fixed assets.
29.       The fiscal year 1972/73 income statement of BFCPC is shown in
Table 2. The expenses of BFCPC are mostly for salaries and benefits. For
fiscal year 1972/73, total expenditures amounted to Tk 3.9 million, of
which 6.4% was for taxes, interest and rent, 19.5% for non-salary (or
benefit) expenses and 74.1% for salaries, bonuses and benefits.
I.  Current Critical Operating Problems
30.       The most critical operating problems at present are:
1. Labor productivity and discipline,
2. the shortage of foreign exchange,
3. the escalating prices and scarcity of foreign raw materials
and spare parts.
Labor productivity is low, primarily due-to over-employment and the inability
of the factory management to enforce a satisfactory work discipline.  The
production bonus system was adopted primarily to motivate workers and
apparently with some success in the Ghorasal Fertilizer Factory. The proposed
project, with the creation of a new company (AFCC), is not expected to have
labor problems. Sufficient spare parts for the factory are also provided in
the capital cost estimate.



ANN-EX 2-2

31.       With the rapid increase in international prices, the budget and
foreign exchange provisions for raw materials and spare parts purchases
are severely insufficient. Fbuthermore, the non-availability of some
materials have also contributecl to low capacity utilization.  In general,
production requirements for a £'ix month period are considered. This short
horizon is probably dictated by foreign exchange constraint. Considering
the scarcity of materials and the long procurement processing procedures,
it is not surprising that there is significant plant downtime due to the
non-availability of parts or raw materials.

BANGLADESH-ASHUGANJ FERTILIZER PROJECT
THE AGRICULTURAL SECTCR IN BANGLADESH 1/
A. The Role of the Sector
1.         The importance of agriculture in the Bangladesh economy extends
beyond its contribution of more than 55 percent to GDP and its provision
of livelihood to over 75 percent of the total labor force, for there are
important areas of dynamic interaction between agriculture and the rest
of the economy which are crucial to the pace and direction of economic
development in Bangladesh. First and most obviously, the agricultural
sector is a primary determinant of foreign exchange availability. Between
1969/70 and 1972/73, exports of raw jute and jute goods, dependent entirely
on the size and quality of the jute crop, earned between 75 percent and
87 percent of Bangladesh's foreign exchange. Many minor exports such as
tea, fish, spices, leather, hides and skins also originate from the agricultural
sector. Together these minor agro-based exports earned some 9 percent
of Bangladesh's foreign exchange in 1972/73. The size of the rice crop
determines the need for foodgrain imports, which in 1969/70 - the last
"normal" year before independence - constituted nearly 20 percent of total
imports. Second, the largest component of Bangladesh's industrial sector,
jute textiles, depends directly on raw material from the agricultural sec-
tor. Third, the agricultural sector can be an important market for goods
and services from other sectors.  As agriculture modernizes, demands for
locally produced inputs (such as fertilizers), equipment (such as pumps
and tubewell materials), services (trade and transport), agriculturally based
processing industries, and basic consumer goods and services are likely
to accelerate, with effects in both urban and rural areas. Fourth, by
providing sufficient food at a low enough price, agriculture can help keep
demands for wage increases down, thereby increasing the relative profita-
bility of other sectors and dampening urban political pressures for cheap
food. In short, growth in agriculture can have a stimulating impact on
growth in all other sectors of the economy.
2.         If agriculture dominates the national economy, it overwhelms
the rural economy. About 80 percent of the rural labor force is directly
engaged in agriculture. It is not possible to determine with any precision
what portion of total rural income is directly attributable to agriculture,
but one very crude estimate is about 70 percent.2/ But these numbers naturally
understate the importance of agriculture, for most of the other rural activi-
ties - trade, processing, construction, and the like - depend almost directly
upon agriculture. Indeed the variations in the agricultural seasons determine
the very pace of rural life, from the bustle of the market place when jute
and paddy crops are harvested, to the long dry spell, for most farmers, bet-
ween the harvesting of tie late summer (Aman) crop, and the harvesting of

the summer (Aus) crop.-!   During the peak seasons it is common for those
normally or partially employed in other occupations to supplement their
income by work in the fields. ?rogress in the agricultural sector is
thus likely to have beneficial repercussions on the rest of the rural economy.
3.         During the 1950's an(d 1960's, however, the agricultural sector
in Bangladesh was not even able to provide enough food for its growing
population, let alone take a leading role in the econony.  While policy-
makers gave increasing rhetorical emphasis to the importance of agricui-
ture,  the sector as a whole grew by only about 2.0 percent per year,2
causing foodgrain imports to grow from less than 200,000 tons in 1955/56
to over 1.5 million tons by 1969/70. One study found that real per capita
rural incomes fell during this period from Rs 275 in the early 1950's to
Rs 268 in the early 1960's. Over the qa,me period the study shows urban
incomes growing from Rs 619 to Es 677.a/  Severe drought combined with
interruption of the agricultural development programs during the struggle
for independence, left agricultural output in 1972/73 about 20 percent
lower than 1969/70 levels.
4.         Planning for the development of agriculture in Bangladesh is an
enormously difficult task, made more so by the complexity of the country's
physical environment and socio-economic structure. Although soil fertility
is fairly high and temperatures allow year round cropping, agricultural
development is constrained by a number of factors:
(i)   Possibilities for further expanding the cultivable
area of 22.5 million acres are limited, and gains in
agricultural production will require more intensive
land use and higher yields.
(ii)  About 2.5 million acres are deeply flooded (over 15ft)
and cultivation of such land is possible only after the
flood subsides :in November; and a further 5.5 million
acres which are annully flooded from 3 to 15 ft. are suit-
able for cultivation of only one crop of floating rice.
(iii) During the dry season from November to March, irrigation
is essential for foodgrain production.
(iv)  Abnormal floods, droughts and cyclonic storms occur from
time to time and hamper agricultural production.
(v)   With a population density of over 2,000 per square mile
of cultivated l1.nd, farms are very small and fragmented
(2.5 - 3 acres on the average) and agriculture is charac-
terized largely by subsistence farming.

5.         The ecology of Bangladesh is delicately balanced, and this
further constrains certain types of development activities. There are
obvious areas of concern such as the impact of pesticide use on the vital
fisheries and the impact of excessive upstream irrigation on saline
intrusion from the Bay of Bengal, inland water transport and, again, fish-
eries, but almost any conceivable development activity has repercussions
on other, apparently unrelated activities. For example, high embankments,
on which roads are usually built so as to be useable during the flood
season, can have serious localized effects on drainage and flood control
by dianging the ways in which the waters can flow. The need to be alert
to these sorts of physical implications makes development much more com-
plicated.  Socio-economic considerations add another dimension of complexity.
The level and distribution of income in Bangladesh is such that perhaps
a third of the people have only the bare minimum needed to survive. A
primary goal will have to be that this segment of the population benefits
sufficiently from the development process.  The rapid growth of the popu-
lation makes an already difficult task that much more difficult.
B. Land, Land Use and Cropping Patterns
6.         Land is the major constraint to expanding agricultural production
in Bangladesh. Data on land utilization are shown below. Over the years,
as population pressure has increased, more land has been used more and more
intensively. Increases in cultivated area have come about by a decrease in
area classified as "cultivable waste" (land suitable for cultivation but
lying fallow for more than a year) from an average about 1.95 million acres
over the last half of the 1950's to only .7hL million acres in 1969/70.
Increased cropping of the cultivated area has taken place through a decrease
in "icurrent fallows" (cultivated area not cropped in a given year) from 1.32
million acres to .73 million acres. Further changes in these two categories
of land are likely to take place only slowly as much of the remaining
cultivable waste is probably very marginal land, and some fallow lands will
be needed for cattle grazing, shifts in cropping patterns, etc.   Moreover,
increases in area "not available for cultivation", which have been substan-
tial in the past, are likely to continue as urban demands and requirements
for rural housing grow.

7.        More significant than the increase in cultivated area has been
the growth in "cropped area".  As the above table indicates, this was achieved
by a dramatic increase in multiple cropping, raising intensity from 120
percent to n16 percent. Thus nearly half of the cultivated area is double-
cropped. While the temperatures and daylightare sufficient to permit year-
round cropping, when one considers that about one-third of the land is flooded
every year, that drought threatens nearly every farm and that cyclones and
shifts in river beds are a frequent threat, this achievement is remarkable.
Chart 1 after p. 8 of this annex indicates graphically how the cultivated
area in Bangladesh is used throughout the year to achieve this kind of inten-
sity. Rice dominates the agr' ulture of Bangladesh. It is grown in these
seasons - aus, aman and boro Y! - and through two general techniques -
1/ Aus:  Predominantly rainfed.  Accounts for 32 percent of rice acreage and
25 percent of production. Broadcast aus is sown mid-March through
mid-May; transplanting i:3 between 1 March and mid-April; harvested
mid-July to mid-September.
Aman: Predominantly rainfed. iiccounts for 60 percent of rice acreage and
production. Broadcast arman is a deep water floating rice which elongates
with rising water levels in the flood season.  Broadcast is sown mid-
March to end April; transplanting is between July to mid-September;
harvested mid-November to mid-January.
Boro: Irrigated. Accounts for 8 percent of the rice acreage and 15 percent
of the production. Transplanted November to Febnrmry; harvested
March to June.

broadcasting and transplanting.  The vari-eties of rice gronT vary by season
and technique and the choice depends on the characteristics of the land, the
resources available to the farmer. the state of technology and alternative
cropping possibilities. The geographical distribution of different cropping
patterns in Bangladesh is hbowr in the attached "Niajor Cropping Patterns"

fication will be increasingly difficult.
8.        The quality of the land also affects cro- yields.  Although Bangla-
desh's deltaic plain is fairly fertile. the soils do lack adequate amounts
of iniportant nutrients.  Moreover, the extreme variations in water flowJs
throughout the year cormibine with the flat terrain to produce a very risky
environment for growing crops and to depress yields below their potential.
For example, since much of the land is deeply flooded during the monsoon,
a large part of the rice acreage imust be planted to relatively low-yielding,
but flood-tolerant, broadcast aman rice. Abnormal floods often damage the
other rice crops severely. Further, since much of the rice crop depends on
the monsoon rains and the normal flooding they bring, and since the mcnsoon
generally fails in at least part of the country in any year, the predominantly
rainfed aus and anan crops frecuently do not yield their potential. Since
these crops account for some 92 percent of rice acreage, rice output is
heavily dependent on the highly variable weather. During the dry winter
season, river levels and flows fall sharply, restricting irrigation possibi-
lities.  Excessive irrigation at this time can enable salt water to intrude
further upstream and underground, with harmful effects on crops and water
supplies. In spite of these difficult interrelationships between Bangladesh's
land and water resources, as the following table indicates, Bangladesh's rice
yields are fairly respectable by regional standards.  While they are far
lower than those of Japan, this reflects more the difficult ecological condi-
tions than any backwardness or lack of effort on the Ipart of the farmers of
Bangladesh.

9.        While there has been an increase in cultivated and total cropped
area over the past years, in no way has it kept pace with population
grawth. Thus, total cropped area per person declined from about .575 acres
in 1949/50 to .468 acres in 1969/70. E~ven assuming that cropped area
continues to expand as rapidly as it did over the past twenty years, a
rather optimistic assumption in view of the points raised above, by the end
of the Plan (1977/78) there will be only about .420 cropped acres per person
in Bangladesh. The relationship between population and land is very uneven
throughout the country, with population density in the thickly populated
eastern area of Comilla and Chil'tagong districts being about twice that of
the less crowded districts in the Northwest.
C. Farm Size and Farm Labor
10.       The supply of labor iE not an important constraint to agricultural
development in Bangladesh. Only during certain peak periods does the seasonal
demand approach the available supply and then increased wages draw workers
from other sectors to meet the temporary demands. The fundamental problem
is one of excess supply rather than shortages and a basic question is the
extent to which the agricultural sector can productively employ the available
supply of labor.
11.       In the past, the agric-iltural sector has shown a remarkable ability
to absorb increases in the labor force. During the 1950's while agricultural
output increased by about 1.4 percent a year, _  the,numbe3 in the agricultural
labor force increased by about 2.8 percent a year. 2/  Since less than 1
percent of the labor force in 1961 was classified as unemployed, clearly such
a labor force increase is due in large part to increased underemployment in
agriculture. This underemploymenit is reflected in a reduced output per
cultivator. In the sixties, when output grew by some 2.8 percent per _year,
the agricultural labor force grew by somewhat less than 2.4 percent.3/
12.       The rapid increase in the agricultural labor force during a time
when the supply of land grew only marginally suggests the increasingly labor
intensive character of agriculture in Bangladesh. Since so much labor is
already employed per acre in Bangladesh, it will become increasingly difficult
to find useful employment for any addition. Since the present labor force
contains considerable slack, any increase in labor requirements may be met
by more intensive work and longer hours of work by the present labor force
as well as by additions to the labor force.

13.       The increasing size of the rural work force has been accompanied
by a steady reduction in farm size and area cultivated per worker. Between
1960 and 1968, the average farm size declined from about 3.5 acres to 3.1
acres.!/ Since land holdings are not evenly distributed, the average farmer
farmed something under 2.5 acres in 1968, considerably less than the 3.1 acre
average. About 66 percent of the farms and 58 percent of the land are owned
by owner-cultivators. Another 30 percent of the farms and 38 percent of
the land are cultivated by farmers who own part of the farm and rent the res .
The remaining 4 percent of farms and 4 percent of the land are cultivated by
pure tenants.2/ In all, about 81 percent of the land is owner operated.
While the average farmer may farm 2-2.5 acres of land, many are not so 1uack>
About 25 percent of the farmers farm less than one acre.  Still less fortun3.-'
are the landless workers who comprise some 13-14 percent of the agricultura!
work force.3/
14.       Although very poor, the farmers of Bangladesh have demonstrated
great skills over the years. Their development of complex cropping pattenis
suited to the difficult environmental conditions, their rapid adoption of
high yielding varieties, their responsiveness to prices,4/ their very surv- 'l
on very few resources, all point to adaptive, innovative and industrious
characteristics. The Plan set forth a strategy intended to build on these
characteristics by providing the farmers with new crop varieties and inputs
which will both increase output and labor use. Fortunately, much of the
technology for implementing this strategy has already been developed5/ and
had begun to be introduced before the Plan began.
D. Implications for Agricultural Development Strateg
15.       The paragraphs above indicate that while the development o. `ae
agricultural sector is vital to the economy of Bangladesh, the potentia2Ls
for such development are seriously constrained by lack of additional land

and by the necessarily slow pace of irrigation development.  Yet Bangladesh's
needs for agricultural output are growing constantly. The inability of
agricultural production to keep pace with population was dram,atically
demonstrated by the growth in foodgrain imports from about 500,0c0 tons in
the early 1960's to 1.5 million tons by 1969/70 and 2.8 million tons by
1972/73. Faced with these growirig problems, the major focus of Bangladesh's
agricultural strategy will have to be a more intensive agriculture with
greater yields and higher croppirg intensities.
16.       Crucial to such a strategy over the next five or ten years will be
the spread of seeds of new varieties and fertilizer. Seeds of improved
high-yielding varieties, combined with fertilizer offer great potential for
increasing yields. Some varieties mature in less time, making multiple
cropping more feasible. Already certain high-yielding varieties are in
widespread use during certain seasons: IR-8 is grown on 45 percent of the
boro acreage and IR-20 is grown on about 17 percent of the transplanted aman
acreage. As new varieties more carefully adapted to the particular ecological
conditions of Bangladesh are evolved, the usage will spread. Already there
are reports of improved varieties suitable for large areas of the aus crop and
of new varieties better suited for some aman areas than IR-20.
17.       The fairly rapid adoption of these new varieties has been accompanied
by an increase in demand for complementary inputs, particularly fertilizer.
The speed of the adoption of the view seed-fertilizer technology suggests that
this is a technology which the small farmers of Bangladesh can adopt. In part
the suitability of this technology arises from its divisible nature -- farmers
can adjust the amount of seed and fertilizer they use to the size of their
holding, to their ability to pay or to the availability of the inputs.
18.       The agricultural production strategy of the First Five-Year Plan
depends heavily on the spread of high-yielding varieties, but may understate
their potenLial in rainfed areas. In the Basic Economic Report on Bangladesh,
a projection of cropping patterns, yield and production was prepared. This
projection, lke any other, must be viewed with caution since it rests on
many assumptions concerning such -nterdependent variables as land availability,
irrigation development, availability of inputs, price behavior, and the
developments and spread of new technology.!! The results of the projection
are summarized in Table 6 at the etnd of this annex. For the next five and 10
years, the projections suggest thE;t the major increases in foodgrain output
will come from extending the use of HYV to a wider area and increasing the
yields of HYV by increased use cf fertilizer.

BANGLADESH-ASHUGANJ FERTILIZER PROJECT
FERTILIZER CONSUMPTION AND SUPPLY
A. Historical Consumption Data
1.        Fertilizer use grew rapidly from 11,000 product tons in 1955/66,
to 66,000 tons in 1960/61 to about 306,000 tons in 1970/71, an increase of
over 12.1 percent annually. During the struggle for independence, local
production and imports of fertilizer were seriously disrupted, resulting
in a severe fertilizer shortage and drop in consumption to 252,000 tons
in 1971/72.  In 1972/73 consumption rose sharply to 375,000 tons.  While
the total quantity of fertilizer has grown rapidly, there has been only a
very slight increase in the use of higher analysisfertilizers and a slow, bare'.y
perceptable shift towards increasing the proportion.s of phosphatic and potassie
nutrients in the total amount of nutrient.  Urea, triple-superphosphate
(TSP) and muriate of potash (MP) are, (with the exception of relatively small
amounts of ammonium sulphate used only on the tea estates) the only fertilizers
now used in Dangladesh. Past consumption by type of fertilizer in Bangladesh
since 1963/64 is shown in Table 1 (at the end of this Annex).
2.        Fertilizer use varies considerably by district. Tables 2 and 3
(at the end of this Annex) show historical fertilizer sales by district.
Table h tabulates districtrwisefertilizer use in 1972/73 in terms of both
product type and nutrient per acre cultivated. The data show considerable
variations among the districts. It is particularly interesting that the
agriculturally advanced areas of Chittagong, Comilla, Dacca and Kishorganj,
which have only 20 percent of the net cultivated area, used nearly half of
the fertilizer sold in 1972/73.
B. International Comparative Consumption Data by Nutrient
3.        Wide variations in the consumption of fertilizers are found through-
out the world, according to the availability of land, water, raw materials
and other farm inputs, as well as inherent soil fertility, agricultural prac-
tices and cropping patterns. A recent comparison is given below:

NOTE:  Differences in application ratios in kg per hectare and
corresponding nutrient ratios reported by various sources
sometimes arise due to doublecropping and the practice of
leaving some land in fallow, especially in some sub-tropical
and tropical countries. Thus, it may be difficult to dis-
tinguish between "cultivated" land and "arable" or "cropped
land". The above comparisons are made on a reported arable
land basis tD the extent discernable.

6.        The establishment of the Fenchuganj Urea/AS plant and the Ghorasal
urea plant gave Bangladesh a total rated capacity of about 450,000 tons per
year of urea and 12,000 tons per year of AS. The Fenchuganj plant's produc-
tion, however, has fluctuated considerably. Urea output from Fenchuganj as
a percentage of capacity has varied from over 100% in 1967/68 to less than
35%. in 1972/73. The Ghorasal plant was just being broken in during 1970/71
when technical problems led to disruption of its production. It
was reportedly operating at about 75% of capacity during the first half of
1973/74.  The plant was shut down for overhaul during part of the summer of
1974 and in the fall of 1974 an explosion destroyed the control room and
the plant is expected to remain closed throughout fiscal year 1974/75.
Although two TSP plants with a combined rated-capabity of 150,000 tons per
year, were mechanically completed for sometime, trial production only begun
recently. The following table summarizes procurement of fertilizers from

D. Projected Fertilizer Demand and Supply
8.        As noted above, fertilizer consumption has risen rapidly over the
past decade, indicating a strong and growing demand. Severe supply constraints
during the struggle for indenendence caused consumption of fertilizer to fall
from about 158,000 nutrient tons in 1970/71 to 77,000 in 1971/72. In 1972/73,
in spite of the war, the drought, a doubling of fertilizer prices and the overall
poverty of the farmers, demand for fertilizor, supported by rapid increases .n
rice prices, remained very strong and consumption rose to about 196,000 tons.
Farmers frequently reported paying substantially more (two to three times) than
the subsidized official fertilizer price (which itself doubled between Tune 1972
and J'ily 1973 and agair increased substantially in Apr-l 1974 (Annex 3-3).
9.        Demand for fertilizer is expected to continue growing rapidly in the
future. How much it will grow depends on a wide range of variables, including
the areas under particular crops, the expansion of irrigation, the fertilizer
responsiveness of different crops, the relative prices of fertilizers and
crops, and the efficiency of the marketing and istribution system.  Data on
amounts of fertilizer applied to each crop are not available and have to be
imputed by relating monthly fert:lizer sales to the cropping pattern. Although
countless fertilizer trials have been carried out, they have not been constructed
to permit determination of the quiantity and mix of nutrients which is economically
optimal for the farmers in different areas for different crops under conditions
of great uncertainty. Generalized fertilizer dose recommendations for the whole



AMIEX 3-2
Page 5
country tend to be based more on abstract notions that balanced dosages
are per se good than on well-documented evidence. The recommendations appear
to overstate the importance of TSP and MP. The farmers tend to take a
different view from that of those who prepare fertilizer does recommendations.
Consequently, while farmers have been quick to purchase urea, thev are increasing
proportions of TSP and FT only slowly. The inadequacy of available data make
it difficult both for the farrmer to know what he should do and for the planner
to project what he will do.
10.        With these factors in mind,an estimate of fertilizer demand was
developed for the Bangladesh Basic Economic Report and is compared with the
Bangladesh First Five-Year Plan projections below.

a/ See Table 5 atihe end of this Annex for details; estimates above exclude
ammonium sulfate requirements for tea estates.  Demand in a given year m,ay
exceed actual consumption due to supply constraints.
b/ Actual procurement of urea, TSP and MP were 260.6, 93.6 and 18.3 thousard tcins
re3pectively.
The Plan projects total fertilizer demand to grow at 25 percent p.a. betwee
1972/73 and 1977/78, with urea growing at 18 percent, TSP at 31 percent anG.
MP at nearly 60 percent. The IDA estimate foresees a growth in total ferti-
lizer consumption over the same period of 18 percent annually, with urea,
TSP, and MP increasing at annual rates of 16.6 percent, 21 percent, and 21L
percent, respectively. The IDA estimate of urea demand in 1977/78 is very
close (within 6 percent) to the Plan projection. The major differences
between the projections arise from differing assumptions about the rate at
which farmers will use TSP and MP and about the rate at which irrigation w- Li
be expanded. After 1977/78 the IDA projection shows  continued demand growth,
but at a somewhat slower rate. While all such projections mrust be viewed with
some caution because they involve a wide range of assumptions about a number
of interdependent variables, the IDA projections were prepared by an agronomist
with long experience in Bangladesh agriculture and provide a reasonable estimate
of the likely orders of magnitude to be expected.



ANNEX 3-2

11.      Future supplies of locally produced urea will depend on the  per-
fornance of the existing urea plants and the time at which the proposed
new urea plant comes into operation. At the present time, the following
assumptions reflect IDA's understanding of the most likely projection of
local urea production:
(a)  In 1974/75, Fenclluganj will produce 30,000 tons of urea
and Ghorasal pertaps 10,000 tons for a total of 40,000
tons of urea (18,400 tons of N). The low levels of out-
put result from eaxtensive plant overhauls planned during
1974/75 and the explosion at the Ghorasal factory.
(b)  In 1975/76 Fenchu.ganj will produce 80,000 tons of urea per
year and Ghorasal. about 170,000 tons for a total of 250,000
tons          of urea (115,000 tons of N).
(c) During 1976/77 and onwards, Fenchuganj will produce 80,000
tons per year and Ghorasal 272,000 tons per year for a total
of 352,000 tons of urea per year (161,920 tons of N).
(d) The Ashuganj Fertilizer Plant (the project) will beigin
operations in August 1978 and will produce about 30 ,000
t,ons of urea in 1978/79, 1435,000 tons in 1979/80 and
1475,200 tons in 1980/81 and subsequent years (or respectively
1141,700; 200,100; and 218,600 tons of N).
12.     The following table compares the IDA projection of urea demand
(para. 10) with the projection Df local production of urea (para. 11) after
converting both into nutrient (naitrogen) equivalents.

ANNEX 3-2

Chart 1 (at the end of this Annex) expresses these numbers graphically.
The projections imply that demand for nitrogen will exceed local production
until 1978/79, the second year of production of the Ashuganj plant. There
would then be about four years of modest surplus production before local
demand would again exceed supply. Given projected world fertilizer require-
ments and Bangladesh's natural cost advantage in producing fertilizer (see
IFC Report No. 446, Fertilizer Requirements of Developing Countries, May 15,
197h), Bangladesh should experience little difficulty in profitably exporting
any fertilizer production in excess of local needs.
13.         It is assumed that all MP would continue to be imported.  Local
TSP trial production has begun, but given past performance it will probably
be necessary to continue to import significant quantities of finished TSP.
Although no recent thorough study has been done on this subject, expansion
of local TSP capacity (which depends entirely on imports of bulky raw
materials) would be of questionable profitability.

ANNEX 3-3

BANGLADESH - ASHtUGANJ FERTIZER PROJECT
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION OF FERTILIZER
A. The Marketing and Distribution System
1.        The Bangladesh AgricuLtural Development Corporation (BADC)1ynports
and procures locally nearly all fertilizer distributed in Bangladesh-.  BADC
is broadly responsible for prOcturement of virtually all agricultural inputs,
machinery and equipment and for the distribution of seeds and fertilizer.
It also runs government seed mu-tiplication farms, deploys, operates and
maintains low-lift pumps and deep tubewells, sinks and maintains shallow
tubewells and deploys and maintaLins tractors and power tillers. Chart 1
shows the overall organizational structure of BADC.
2.        Within BADC, the Supply Wing is responsible for the procurement
and distribution of fertilizer. Chart 2 shows the organization structure
and staffing of the Supply Wing. The fertilizers are imported or procured
ex-factory locally by the purchase division of the Supply Wing. They are
then transferred to the General Manager (Supply) who is responsible for the
movement, shipping, storage and sales of fertilizer.  BADC is responsible
for the movement of fortilizersdown to the Thana level. At the Thana level
it is purchased either by one of the 29,000 private licensed retail dealers
or, in the case of 62 of the h13 Thanas, by the Thana Central Cooperative
Association (TCCA), which acts as a wholesale agent and resells the fertilizer
either to its member village cooDeratives or to private retail agents.
Private agents pay BADC for the fertilizer in cash. The TCCAs, once they
have obtained the requisite bank guarantee, purchase the fertilizer from
BADC on credit.
3.        Considering the inherent difficulties of transportation in Bangladesh,
this fertilizer distribution system has worked rather well in the past. It
has proven flexible enough to handle the massive expansion in fertilizer use
over the last decade. It has also, through the vast network of small dealers,
brought fertilizer to within the reach of virtually every farmer in Bangladesh.
The dealers as a matter of coursee sell fertilizer in minute quantities - often
only a few kilograms at a time - so that a farmer can buy the precise amount
he wants and can afford.  This iF an important advantage in a land of small
farmers.
4.        With the price distortions and the severe general fertilizer short-
ages of the past few years, however, the system has shown faults and
attracted increasing criticism. Many factors are involved in this. The
disequilibrium between the Indian and Bangladesh official exchange rates has
provided a strong incentive for smuggling. The strength of farmers' demand,
1/ An exception is the relativel;y small amounts of AS, formerly imported
by BADC and distributed by thg Bangladesh Tea Association (B.T.A.) and
now procured directly by the 3.T.A. from the Fenchuganj factory.



while supplies have been disrupted by the war of independence, has led to
the emergence of an active black market in fertilizers where farmers pay
two or three times the official price. The transportation system was
seriously disrupted during the war, with great losses to the vehicle f.leet
and the destruction of vital bridges. There appear to be weak links
within the distribution system itself.  As a consequence of all these
factors, farmers frequently complain that fertilizers are not available
when they want them.
5.        The present problems in marketing and distribution, combined with
the need to develop a system capable of distributing iach greater quantities
of fertilizer in the future, has led the government to undertake a compre-
hensive fertilizer marketing and distribution study. The main objective of
the study is to propose institutional, organizational and policy changes
and improvements and to identify investment needs in fertilizer distribu-tion.
The first phase of this study, undertaken with technical assistance from the
Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and finaiced by TJSAID, began in April 197h.
The second phase of the study, to be completed later in 1975, would identify
investment projects and prepare detailed feasibility axd pre-appraisal
reports for such projects suitable for financing by external lenders. These
phases of the study should s'ned light on a number of problem areas including:
a.  Bagging and handling methods:  Current practice of using jute
bags with polyethylene liners is expensive but it appears to
protect the fertilizer fairly well through the rough handling
it receives on its way to the farmer. Alternative bagging
materials are much less costly than jute, and if handling
operations are improved, could result in savings.  Other
possibilities to reduce bagging costs would include reusing
the jute bags or charging farmers for the costi of the bags.
b.  Transportation:  Using the results of the Bangladesh Transport
Survey undertaken by the Economist Intelligence TUnit, U.K.
the study will attempt to develop recommendations for the
most efficient means of moving the fertilizer from ports and
factories to the Thana level.  The study will also indicate
whether and at what stages fertilizer should be handled in
bulk rather than bagged and which components of the distribution
system need additional transportation capacity.
c.  Storage:  To accommodate the anticipated growth in fertilizer
use decisions will have to be made soon about the location and
amount of storage capacity which may be necessary. Table 1
(at the end of this annex) provides data on the amount of
storage owned or rented by BADC at the present time. While
the aggregate amount of storage may appear sufficient for the
next few years, storage capacity is presently poorly distributed
and a caretful review of storage requirements by specific



A4TZX 3-3
Page 3
location and level of distribution is needed. For example,
there would appea:' to be little need for renting more than
10,000 tons of storage capacity in Faridpur, a district
whose total sales were under 7,000 tons in 1973.
d. Linkages between supply - wholesale - retail operations: A
number of problemr exist in the linkages of the distribution
system. For example, in those areas where TCCAs operate as
wholesale agents they frequently do not receive the bank
guarantee necessary for purchasing fertilizer on credit from
BADC at the appropriate time. Also they delay placing their
orders with BADC in order to minimize their interest eharges.
As a result, fertilizer is often not ordered early enough to
reach the farmer's field at the right time. Another problem
has been the low retail commission which, combined with the
small average volune of sales, meant a gross revenue for the
average dealer of less than Tk 600 in 1972/73. In April 1974!,
however, the commission was raised from Tk 40 per ton to Tic 60
per ton. Another complication inhibiting the flow of
fetbilizer to the larmers has been the "Priority List System"'
initiated in 1972 inder which the Union Agricultural Assistant
(the local level extension agent) drew up a list of farmers
who   could buy !ertilizer and how much. The list was then
to be reviewed by a Thana Agricultutal Committee, chaiied by
the local Member of' Parliament and allocations made to dealers,
each of whom was to be instructed on how much fertilizer each
farmer could buy. The system had potential for abuse and
introduced rigidities in the system which resulted in significant
shortfalls in the tmount of fertilizer distributed in the Fall
of 1973. As a conmequence the system was temporarily suspended
for the 1974 winter and spring crops and the shortfalls began
to disappear.
6.        In addition to examining the specific problems of the fertilizer
marketing and distribution system, the study will also examine and make
recommendations on such broader issues as fertilizer requirements and demand
(discussed in Annex 3-2), fertilizer application practices and supply sources.
The study will also investigate the areas of pricing policy and methods of
sales promotion discussed in Section B and C below.
B. Pricing Policy
7.        Official retail prices Tor fertilizer have been highly subsidized
in Bangladesh. In the last half of 1973 these subsidies amounted to about
19 percent for urea, 57 percent for TSP and 55 percent for MP, (see
following Table). The strength and resilience of fertilizer demand during
recent years calls into question t.he need to continue fertilizer subsidies.
The fertilizer shortages, combined with the subsidies, have encouraged
smuggling fertilizer into India and the development of a black market
charging 2-3 times the official piice.  Farmers are already highly aware
of the importance of fertilizer anLd they frequently have to pay far more
than the full cost price on the black market.  In addition, there is concern
that it is the more economically End politically influential farmers who
reap the most benefit from the sutsidies.  Therefore, the removal of these



ANNEX 3-3
Page 4
subsidies should neither dampen fertilizer demand significantly nor cause
undue hardship to the poorer farmers, particularly if rice prices remain
near present levels and if credit institutions are improved. Moreover,
the present subsidies can lead to misallocation of fertilizer both among
areas and among crops. Accordingly, the Government has begun to eliminate
these subsidies on a phased basis over the next five years. Initially,
however, as a result of stiff political opposition to this policy, the
phased reduction has been delayed somewhat. As a result, the Government
was receiving substantially less than planned from fertilizer sales during
1973/74.
8.        World market prices for fertilizer rose dramatically during 1973
and early 1974, increasing the costs of providing fertilizer to farmers.
The selling price, however, remained fixed, leading to a rapid increase in
the subsidy and a major drain on financial resources. To offset this
development, in April 1974 the Government raised the prices of urea, TSP
and 1'T by 67%, 100% and 100% respectively.  The new urea price more than
covers the delivered cost of locally produced urea (indeed it includes a
16% surplus), but it is about 38% below costs for imported urea prevailing
in early 1974. The new TSP price implies a 60% subsidy and the new 1MP
price a 40% subsidy. For imported urea and TSP the net effect of the
increases in both world market prices and selling prices to the farmers is
a major increase in the absolute size of the subsidy per unit of fertilizer.
For 14P, the amount of subsidy per unit is about the same as before the price
increase. The surplus gained by the Government from sales of locally
produced urea will partially offset the losses on the other types of
fertilizer. The following table summarizes the recent changes in pricing
policy.

9.        The increase in fertilizer prices was a necessary step, but it is
difficult to see the rationale for the structure of the price increases. The
new prices, in effect, tax urea to subsidize TSP and MP. Moreover, the
absolute size of the subsidy for fertilizers may grow, depending both on the
mix of fertilizers consumed by the farmers (particularly on how much TSP is
used) and on whether urea imports are necessary. Given the volatility of the
world market for fertilizers, it is difficult to determine what pricing
policies Bangladesh should follow to balance the current, short term, high
fertilizer prices against the longer term fertilizer prices which may be sub-
stantially lower. It is clear that the Government's financial position does
not allow it to continue to sell fertilizer at a loss indefinitely.  All of this
suggests the necessity of a careful review of fertilizer pricing policy.
C. Sales Promotion, Extension and Credit
10.       Fertilizer dealers have in the past several years faced a seller's
market.  With demand for fertilizers exceeding supply, little effort was
required to sell available stocks. With fertilizer use so low, the marginal
increase in output from using fertilizers was very high to the farmers. This,
combined with high and rising rice prices and the introduction of new, more
fertilizer-responsive, high-yielding varieties, has kept demand growing at a
brisk pace. In the future, supplies of fertilizer, particularly urea, are
likely to be in better balance with demand. Moreover, growth in demand for
fertilizer may slow down as farmers increase their dosages to levels closer 'o,
but still well below, their economic optimum. This may happen because the
farmer does not know what the economically optimum dose for his use is, because
the farmer is unwilling to take greater risks for smaller marginal gains in the
face of great uncertainty about floods, droughts and crop prices, and because
the farmer is unwilling to bear the greater financial burden implied by the
higher doses.   All this implies    that it may become more and more difficult
in the future to get farmers to use the fertilizers needed to keep agricultural
production growing.
11.       Sates promotion activities in their broadest sense will, therefore,
be increasingly neces6ry.  As noted above, the relatively small commission
earned by the average dealer is not likely to cause him to undertake any
major promotion effort. (Althuagh the commission has been raised from Tk 40
to Tk 60 per ton, in view of the parallel increase in fertilizer prices, the
retailer's commission has fallen in percentage terms.) The present system,
however, has the important advantages of bringing fertilizer almost to the
fanmer's doorstep and of selling fertilizers in the tiny quantities desired
by small farmers.
12.       Before the fertilizer dealers, or even the extension agents (Union
Agricultural Assistants or UAA's), can encourage farmers to use more fertilizer
or increase the proportion of P and K nutrients in the fertilizer mix farmers
use, they first must have some better notion of the economically optimal ferti-
lizer doses. As suggested above, most farmers view the present recommended
doses as unrealistically high. The recommendations are based on field trials
carried out in ways which make it impossible to deternine economically optimal
doses or the independent effects, over a range of doses, of the different major
nutrients (N, P and K). Moreover, they take no account of the changing relation-
ship between crop prices and fertilizer prices, of the risk and uncertainty



MIMIX 3-3
Pag,e 6
faced by the farmer, or of the considerable variations which exist in dif-
ferent parts of the country. Nor do the recommendations offer much advice as
to when and how to apply the fertilizer.  A necessary first step would be to
review past fertilizer trial data and begin a new series of trials desigl)ed
to provide information more meaningful for the farmers' needs.  Dual purpose
fertilizer trial/demonstration plots could produce the data needed and show
farmers the results at the same time.  Armed with such information - conveyed
either in a short course or through simple written instructions - the fertilizer
dealer could encourage greater fertilizer use based on sound technical advice.
13.       The existing channels of conveying technical information to the
farmers - the extension services and the farmer training programs at the Thana
Training and Development Centers - should play a major role in carrying the
results of the fertilizer trials and other tecimological improvements, to the
farmers.  Indeed, these channels could themselves, in coordination with the
relevant research   institutions organize and carry oult the trials and demon-
strations.  The extension serice and the farmer training programs currently
have serious weaknesses, however, which preclude relying strongly on them in
the short term.
14.       At present the main extension network consists of some 4,000 exten-
sion workers (Union Agricultural Assistants or UAA's) posted at the Union level-/
They are the only development officers posted at that low an administrative
level. Their training includes a secondary school pass and perhaps some training
at an Agricultural Extension Training Institute. They are each responsible for
the agricultural output of over 5,000 acres and for some 1,700 farm families.
They are expected to be knowledgable about the many varieties of the many crops
grown, the latest improvements in cultivation practices, fertilizer doses,
pesticides and their use, fisheries, livestock and irrigation. At the same
time they are supposed to meet production targets, gather statistics, help with
the census, assist in relief work and do anything else that comes to mind.  There
have been proposals tha; it is not appropriate for UAA's to be so narrowly
focussed on agriculture and that they should take on additional responsibilities
such as health and family planning as well.  This is a lot to ask of a man who
is poorly trained, is one of the lowest paid government officers, has no housing
(which in the traditional muslim rural setting seriously limits his ability to
visit villages), and is offered virtually no hope of promotion. Small wonder
that farmers report seeing their UAA less than twice a year.  At the Thana level
there is a wide variety of agricultural personnel,2/ but their actual training is
not much better than the UAAs' and their ability to reach farmers is probably
less. Fortunately, farmers seem to be able to adopt major agricultural improvements
without much help from the extension service. But, as refinements in agricultural
technologr become more complex, farmers will need greater technical assis tance.
15.       Farmer training at Thana headquarters in Thana Training and Development
Centers (TTDC) is another method used to convey technical information to farmers.
First developed in Comilla district, it was shown there to have considerable
potential.  Under this system, selected model farmers cone to Thana headquarrers
1/  There are other extension-type activities carrLed out under a number of
area specific and/or crop specific programs.  They have many of the same
problems as the UAA's, plus some of their own.
2/  Including the Thana Agricultural Officer, the Thana Cooperative Officer, the
IRDP Project Officer, the BADC Irrigation Officer, the Plant Protection Officer,
and many more.

periodically to be instructed in new techniques. They then are expected to pass
this information on to others ir. their communities. Unfortunately, overly rapid
expansion combined with the disruptive events of the past several years have
caused serious deterioration in this program. New teaching materials have not
been developed. There is littlE control over the content of the courses as they
are often put together on an ad hoc basis depending on which Thana agricultural
officer happens to be available. The TTDC buildings are sometimes diverted to
other uses.  Small wonder farmers now appear more interested in collecting their
travel allowances than in hearing the same outdated talks time and again. An
FAO/IBRD cooperative program mission began in April 1974L to prepare a rural
development education and training project designed to strengthen the programs
for bringing information to the farmers. Appraisal of this project took
place in July 19741, and work is underway on refining the project.
16.       An effective system of agricultural credit, capable of providing
farmers with timely finance at reasonable interest rates, could ease the
financial burden for farmers of increasing the intensity of fertilizer use.
Unfortunately, institutional (i.a., government/cooperative) agricultural credit
in Bangladesh suffers from serious limitations at the present time.  Agricul-
tural credit in Bangladesh has been the subject of a special sector mission
whose report bas been used to inLtiate a dialogue between the Government
and the Association on ways and mueans of improving agricultural credit.
A brief review of the agricultural credit situation indicates: (a) the
present agricultural credit institutions are, for the most part, in severe
financial trouble;- recovery rates (which are very low) reveal only part
of the problem, for since indepenidence, nearly half of short-term debt sanc-
tioned has been converted by the Bangladesh Bank to medium-term debt, so
the Government would not have to bear the financial burden of carrying out
its obligation to guarantee the 'Loss; (b) at the same time no parallel
debt rescheduling is being carried out at the farm level and recovery of
old debt is not improving; (c) no provision is made in the revenue budget
to guarantee the large volume of lending proposed under the Plan: (d) the
interest rates on agricultural loans are artificially low and do not reflect
the cost of capital, including the administrative costs of the credit system,
and-an allowance for the risks inL lending to farmers; (e) the credit
institutions have not played a significant role in mobilizing rural savings
and resources; and (f) while marx of these problems have been intensified
by the severe hardships of the past three years (and by doubt in farmer's
minds as to their liability for debts incurred before independence), the
problems will remain for several years to come.
17.      The rapid expansion of credit called for in the First Five-Year Plan
would seem inappropriate in the current situation. For reasons of both
finance and implementation capacity, a slower, more careful pace of credit
expansion is indicated. While viable credit institutions may make it easier
to modernize agriculture, the inability of agricultural credit institutions
to expand at the pace proposed in the Plan may not be a serious impediment
to agricultural development in Bangladesh. Comprehensive, recent nation-
wide data on agricultural credit and rural debt do not exist, but some recent
fragmentary data, summarized in Table 2 at the end of this annex, suggest
some interesting points. First, institutional credit provides only a small
portion of the average farmer's btrrowings. Several studies have indicated
that farmers in Bangladesh obtain only about 10 - 15 percent of their bor-
rowings from institutional (goverwmental/cooperative) sources.



AiN: 3-3
Page 8
The largest single source of credit are relatives and friends (52 percent).
Money lenders provide some 30 percent of the credit. Second, less than 5
percent of a farmer's short-term borrowings is used to puirchase agricultural
inputs. The rest is used for consumption and other purposes. The fands
provided by agricultural credit institutions are often not used for agriculture.
Third, only a small part (about 14 percent) of fertilizer purchases are financed
by credit.  All this suggest a fairly weak link between t e present institutional
credit system and the needs of agricultural developmentJ
18.       In spite of grave weaknesses in agricultural credit institutions,
Bangladesh farmers have rapidly increased their use of both fertilizer and HYV
seed. These inputs have apparently been financed largely out of the farmer's
own resources, from sale of small portiors of his crop or from income earned
in subsidiary occupations.  This suggests that at least the initia:! pn-seLi
adoption of the seed-fertilizer technology can begin even though credit
institutions are very weak. One would expect that a more effective rural
credit system might be of special benefit to the small farmholders with
less cash resources who night need to borrow funds just to initially use
high-yielding seeds and fertilizer; but there is no solid evidence that
small farmers hate lagged in the adoption of new technology.2/  Moreover,
the mere expansion of credit flows through existing institutions, which tend
to be dominated by the larger farmers, is not likely to have the desired
effect. This is not to say that an effective credit system would not be a
major asset to agricultural progress, but it does say that mere expansion of
the present system may not yield much return. The implication is that what is
called for is a much slower rate of expansion combined with greater efforts
to improve the quality of the existing institutions.
19.       The limitDpions of the present extension services and credit LnstiLutlons
are a source of serious concern in Bangladesh and various proposals a.,? nder conl-
sideration for strengthening them. It is not likely, however, that the 'eaknesses
of these organizations will prove to be a serious constraint in using the output
of the proposed urea factory and the demand projections in Annex 3-2 reflect fullylr
the known limitations of these services.  Current fertilizer use 4s no- so  'ow
that farmers are a long way from optimum levels.  Firmer-to-farmer troisfers o
information and HYV seeds have done much to spread technological improvrec---t.s 4n
spite of the limitations of the extension service. In the absence of eff. .,'se
institutional credit, traditional sources of finances such as friends,
and money lenders are likely to continue to play a significant role in  ciuw.n
those farmers requiring credit to purchase fertilizers.

1/ The Master Survey of Agricu1ture, No. 9, p. 33, indicates that in 1967/68
farmers with less than 2.5 acres used 35 percent mo;re fertilizer per acre
than did larger farmers.

BANGLADESH: ASHUGANJ FERTILIZER PROJFET
PRODUCTIDN PROCESS, SUPPLY OF NATURAL GAS AND PLANT FACILITIES
A. Production Process and Supply of Natural Gas
1.        The rated output of -;he plant will be 1,600 TPD urea for 330 days
per annum giving a nominal outl)ut of 528,000 TPY. Actual output if a 90% on-
stream efficiency is maintaine(d will be 475,200 TPY. The intermediate
ammonia production facilities iuill be sized on the basis that all ammonia
produced will be converted to tirec in which case rated output would be
approximately 925 TPD or just rmarginally over 1,000 short tons per day.
2.        Gas from the Titas fields  will be  used for  both process and
fuel and will be supplied to the plant at a pressure of around 600 psig as
required for direct steam reforming without further pressure boosting. It
will be the responsibility of the Titas Gas Transmission Company to supply
and install the necessary gas pipeline up to the works from the existing
high pressure transmission line which passes under the railway bridge across the
Meghna River approximately   2   km north of the plant site.  This line will
run below ground along the route of the access road to the site and the
Titas Gas Transmission Company will provide a suitable metering station
adjacent to the works area and a block valve in the main transmission line
to enable full supplies to be maintained to the fertilizer works indepen-
dently of any downstream failure.
Composition of the ga~3 will be as below:
Methane              96.8%
Ethane                1.7%
Propane               0.4%
Butane and Higher     0.5%
Nitrogen              0.3%
Carbon Dioxide        0.3%
Cal. Value (Gross ) 1,036 BTU/cu.ft.
The gas is classified as sweet vrith respect to sulphur content and the
experience of the Ghorasal workE which is also supplied with the same gas
indicates that sulphur content is below 2 ppm. Producers of the gas, the
Bangladesh Shell Oil Company Lindted, remove liquified hydrocarbons in the
field  so  that    the pipeline gas contains less than 2 US gal./l,000 cu.
ft. The Bangladesh Shell Oil Company Ltd., which is 25% owned by the
Government, operates the field and has determined the total reserves at
about 63 billion cubic meters (M3). Details of the gas reserves for the
major  field in  Bangladesh  including Titas  and gas  analysis  are given
in Annex 4-5. The gas offtake projections for the Titas field are
shown in Annex 4-6. Even assuming the gas demand would continue to
increase at about 11% per year predicted for the remainder of the decade,
the Titas gas reserves would last for another 30 years.



ATNEX 4.1
3.        Synthesis gas for ammonia production is produced from the feed
gas in a series of steps beginning with a primary reforming with steam.
Here, desulphurized gas is combined with superheated steam in an amount
approximately equal to a 3 to 1 steam/carbon ratio. The combined stream
at a pressure of approximately 500-550 psig is then preheated to about 950
degrees F. and passed through catalyst-filled 25/20 chrome nickel alloy
tubes suspended in the radiant section of the reformer. In passing through
the tubes the hydrocarbon components, mostly methane, are partly converted
to carbon oxides and hydrogen and exit at a temperature normally in excess
of 1,500 degrees F.  The partially reformed gas then flows to a secondary
reformer where it is mixed with preheated air in a quantity necessary to
reform the unconverted hydrocarbons and at the same time provide the required
amount of nitrogen for ammonia synthesis. Air required for the secondary
reforming step. is supplied from a centrifugal steam turbine driven compressor.
4.        Reformed gas from the secondary reformer now containing less than
about 0.4% methane is cooled in waste heat boilers down to about 700 degrees F.
prior to introduction to the high temperature shift converter where part of
the carbon monoxide content of the gas is converted to carbon dioxide by
reaction with steam with an equivalent production of hydrogen. To complete
this conversion of carbon monoxide the gas after cooling in additional waste
heat boilers and after a protective fine sulphur removal is introduced into
a second stage low temperature converter where the carbon monoxide content
of the gas is reduced to about 0.5%.
5.        The raw synthesis gas now contains essentially hydrogen, nitrogen,
carbon dioxide and small amounts of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide and now
goes through a series of purification steps to provide an ammonia synthesis
gas with a hydrogen/nitrogen ratio of 3 to 1.  In the first of these carbon
dioxide is removed by any of a number of proprietary liquid scrubbing processes
and then remaining carbon oxides are removed by conversion to methane by
reaction with hydrogen over a suitable catalyst. The final synthesis gas
then contains in addition to nitrogen and hydrogen, less than about 10 ppm
oxides, the maximum which can be tolerated by the ammonia synthesis catalyst,
and small amounts of methane which are continually purged from the following
ammonia synthesis loop.
6.        The carbon dioxide removed from the crude synthesis gas is
regenerated from the rich liquid absorbent and is subsequently reacted with
ammonia to form urea. The analysis of the natural gas from the Titas Gas
fields, however, is such that the quantity of carbon dioxide produced in the
gas reforming process described will not be sufficient for urea production
and must be supplemented. The additional quantity required may be obtained
either by absorption from reformer or auxiliary boiler flue gas followed by
regeneration from the absorbent, or by complete combustion of a side stream
of natural gas followed by absorption from the combustion products, or in
exceptional cases by the excess production of crude synthesis gas with
recycling of the excess quantity after carbon dioxide removal, back to the
primary reformer where it is burned as fuel.

7.        In the synthesis of ammonia the nitrogen v-rdrogen mixtLure is
compressed to a pressure of 2,500-3,000 psi by a           -te,; turbine driven 2 or
3 case centrifugal compressor with recycle gas contaiLnng about 11% ammonia
being admitted to an interstage wheel. The coompressed discharge gas after
water cooling is then refrigerated and condensed amon.-L,i res-oved in a liquid
separator before the gases now Containing only abort 2% ar.nrnia are reheated
by heat exchange and passed to trhe ammonia Converter. This vessel is of a
special design containing a catalyst to promr&te the syTnthesis reaction and
special provision for removal of the reaction heat developed, so as to main-
tain optimum reaction temperatures.  The effluent gas from the Converter
contains about 11% NH3 and is coJoled from the rea.ction temperature of about
9o0 degrees F. first in preheating boiler feed water and then by heat
exchange with incoming converter: feed gas, before recycling to the synthesis
gas compressor as described.
3.        Liquid ammonia producod in the process wJll be stored in a
refrigerated liquid ammonia storage tank having a capacity of about 5-6 days
production or some 5,000 tons.
9.        In the production of t!rea, ammonia and carbon dioxide are combined
at a pressure of 2,000-3,500 ps, and a temperature of approximately 360
degrees F. when ammonium carbama.te is formed as an intermediate product,
which is subsequently dehydratec with formation of uirea.  Neither of these
reactions, however, proceeds to completion with the result that the reaction
product consists of a urea/ammorium carbamate solut-ion containing large
quantiities of dissolved amnmnia and carbon dioxide.  The next step in the
production of urea therefore is to separate the non-converted carbamate and
reaction gases and recycle them to the reactor, and the means of doing this
represents the major distinction between the various processes commercially
available.  In one commonly used process t1he pressure of the reaction products'
is reduced in steps with consequent decomposition of carbamate back into
carbon dio.xide and ammonia which are then redissolved by countercurrent
absorption and recycled back to bhe reactor.  In another process the decom-
position is achieved without reduction in pressuare by stripping the solution
leavi-ng the r eactorwith carbon lioxide and in another process a similar
stripping pre.^ess is used employi ng gaseous ammonia. In all these processes
the final urea solutio  is concentrated by evaporation and then in most
cases prilled d1rectly if a biuret concentration of up to 1-1/h percent can
be tolerated, o.; after vacuum crrstalization if a low biuretj grade is
require;.  For thfe project which will produce urea with up to 0.9% biuret,
a preselect.ion of -urea process is not being made and instead a selection will
be made based on the merits of tie proposal.s reeived fr om contractors both
at the prequalification and bidd`ng stage.

B. Plant Facilities
10.       Of the approximate total area of 500 acres already acquired at
Ashuganj by the EFCPC, some 130 acres initially will be filled to a level
of 32 feet to accommodate the proposed plant, the staff housing complex,
and necessary access roads and rail sidings. It is estimated that the level
of this area will have to be raised by an average of 20 feet requiring the
dredging of approximately 4-1/2 million cubic yards of sand from the bed of
the Meghna River. Preliminary estimates indicate that the plant site will
oocupy approximately 65 acres, the housing complex 45 acres, with the balance
being taken up by rail sidings, access roads and vacant areas. It is planned
that construction of an embankment around the perimeter of the area to be
developed and main access road connecting the site to the Ashuganj railway
bridge area would be completed in the dry season of 1974/75 permitting the
dredging work to continue through the wet season of 1975 with completion
being scheduled around October.
11.       After reclamation is completed and after allowing a reasonable
period for settlement, civil works on the plant site and construction of the
first stage of the staff housing complex would begin. The staff housing
complex will accommodate all key staff to be employed by the works when
completed, such as management and supervisory personnel, shift operators and
key production and maintenance workers and security and safety personnel.
Currently the total number of personnel estimated to fall into this category
is around 525 and it is planned to lay out the housing complex accordingly.
A later review of requirements, however, will be carried out at the time of
detailed planning of the complex. Initially the houses will be utilized for
accommodating key personnel engaged in the plant construction phase.
12.       A wharf will be constructed at the plant site designed to be
capable of handling the loading of the entire output from the works onto
coasters or suitable barges for local and export delivery as desired. At
this stage the merits of shipment of part of the product in bulk rather than
in bags is being studied and until a final decision is reached the design
of the wharf facilities will not be defined. However, it is intended that
modern materials conveying and loading equipment will be provided. It is
anticipated that a large portion of the plant output will be handled by rail
and for this a railway spur and sidings will be provided connecting the plant
site with the existing nearby Bangladesh Railway system. Necessary freight
cars will be provided by Bangladesh Railways but two locomotives will be
included as part of the project for the movement of freight cars within the
plant area and adjacent sidings.
13.       Water requirements of the plant and housing complex will be taken
from the Meghna River which has a very low salinity at the plant location.
Raw river water will first be clarified in a circular basin with continuous
mechanical sludge removal and then filtered in automatic self-cleaning sand
filters before being supplied to the potable water chlorination and supply
system, to the demineralizers for boiler feed water, to the plant cooling

water system make up and to other general uses. At this stage it is anti-
cipated that a recirculation cooling water system will be adopted but the
merits of an alternative once-through scheme will be evaluated in the course
of more detailed planning of the works.
14.       Preliminary estimateE indicate that the entire works will consume
approximately 10 MW of electric power. The nearby Ashuganj power station
has adequate spare generating capacity to supply this requirement if desired
but at present pending further examination of the reliability of this source,
provision has been made for caFtive power generation facilities to be
included as part of the project, with the existing power station providing
standby only. Final decision on the power source will be based on maximum
reliability and the economic and technical merits of proposals to be received
from the designers.
15.       All necessary buildings and stores required  for the efficient and
continuous operation of the works will be included in the project. Among
these are a 2,000 sq. meter fully equipped maintenance shop, gate house, fire
station, laboratory, canteen, first aid station and adequate warehouses for
the storage of spare parts and other stores. For the storage of bulk urea a
45-day or 72,000-ton capacity bullk store will be provided fitted out to main-
tain dehumidified air conditionLng necessary for the prevention of caking.
Additionally, a bagged urea store of 15-day or 24,000-ton capacity will be
included.
16.       The type of bag to be used for the urea product is still the subject
of investigation and may be a 2';-kg capacity polyethylene lined jute bag or
a single film heavy duty polyethylene bag.  The plant will be equipped with
facilities for the manufacture either of the polyethylene liners or of the
polyethylene bags as the case may be. A final decision will be taken during
the course of the design of the plant and will be largely influenced by bag
production costs and recommendation of the marketing consultants as to the
preferred type of bag under prevailing conditions of fertilizer distribution
and usage.
17.       Special attention will be paid during design and specifications of
the facilities to minimize the emission and/or discharge of noxious waste
materials. Wherever possible these materials will be recycled within the
process units. Additionally, the design of the process units will be in
accordance with European and U.S. standards with respect to the composition
of liquid and gaseous effluents. Under these conditions and especially with
the added advantage of having a clean sulphur free raw material it is expected
that the works will have little :r no undesirable effect on the enviroment.

BANGLADESH-_ASHUGANJ FERTILIZER PROJECT
ASHUGANJ FERTILIZER AND CHEMICAL COMPANY
TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR MANAGEMENT,
OPERATIONAL AND TRAINING ASSISTANCE
1.        The Government of the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh proposes to
erect a modern ammonia/urea fertilizer complex at Ashuganj on the east bank
of the river Meghna some 60 km northeast of Dacca. The purposes of the
project are to increase the country's capacity to produce fertilizer to
meet local demand, and to the extent that local demand is met, to produce
surplus urea for export. The project will consist of a 1,600 ton per day
(TPD) urea unit, an intermediate ammonia unit of approximately 925 TPD, and
all necessary supporting services, utilities and auxiliary plants and
installations for a fully operable manufacturing complex established on a
grass roots site.  A fully self contained staff housing compound to accommo-
date some 600 staff will be included.
2.        The project will use as its raw material, natural gas supplied
to the site from the nearby Titas gasfields by the Titas Gas Transmission and
Distribution Company. The urea will be dispatched from the works in bags
by barge from a jetty adjacent to the plant site to be constructed
as part of the project and by rail via an existing branch line passing
within 2 km of the plant site.  Distribution and marketing of the urea
fertilizer will be handled by, and will be the responsibility of, the
Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation, a Government Corporation
forming part of the Department of Agriculture.
3.        To implement and operate the project, the Government has estab-
Ushed an entirely new company "The Ashuganj Fertilizer and Chemical
Company Limited" (The Company), under the Companies Act 1913 with all shares
held by the Government.  The Company was incorporated in October 1974
with a capital of TX 1,000,000,000 and with a board of directors of not
less than three and not more than seven members. For the time being the
board will be made up of two nominees of BFCPC*, two nominees of the
Government, and the Managing Director who shall be the Chief Executive of
the Company.
.*The Bangladesh Fertilizer, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Corporation (BFCPC), is
an autonomous state corporation wholly owned by the Government of Bangladesh
and comprising some fifty individual manufacturing enterprises in the
fertilizer, chemical and pharmaceutical industries.  The BFCPC presently
operates four fertilizer manufacturing works as follows:
1.        A 106,000 TPY urea plant and ammonium sulphate-unit at Fenchlgan;.
2.        A 34.0,000 TPY urea plant at Ghorasal.
3.        A 32,000 TPY triple superphosphate (TSP) plant at Chittagong.
4.        A 120,000 TPY TSP plant at Chittagong.



ANNEX 4-6
Page 2
BFCPC will act on behalf of the Company- in planning -   executing the project
until such time as the Company becomes fully operabl,e ,ut irn any event not
later than June 30, 1975.
The object for which the Companr has been established is generally to acquire
and purchase land, plant, machinery and eqIuipment for a urea fertilizer
factory at Ashuganj and construct factory 'btl ldings, office premises, godowns,
jetties and other structures ancL erect the plant and machinery therein,
and further to take over from BP'CPC all. a.ssete required by it for this
purpose and all subsisting contract benefit anct other advantages entered
into and secured for the Urea FErtilizer FacLory by BnXJJ and after
completion of the construction cf the factory to operate same and to
manufacture and sell the fertilizer and other products thereof.  The
Board of the Company will be thE policy making body -with responsibility
for achieving the objective for which the Company has been established and
will have the power to delegate authority to anyone for implementing the
policy, and for ensuring the best use of .k,e assets of the Company by
achieving optimum efficiency against budgeted expenditure and to ensure
the development of the Company's industrial and commercial potentialities
to the highest level. The general direction and management of the affairs
of the Company shall rest in the Directors0
4.        The Project is scheduled -to commence commercial production by
August 1978 and is estimated to ,ost a total of $2t9 million equivalent
including approximately $142 milLion in foreign exchange.  Provision of
such foreign exchange funds is p:-esently under active consideration by a
consortium of international lendars including the Federal Republic of
Germany, acting through the Kred:i.tanstalt fuir Wivledraufbau (KfW); the
Government of Switzerland (GOS); the TJnItied States of America; acting
through the Agency for International Development (AID); the United Kingdom
acting threugh the Overseas Deve opment Ministry  0D"M); the Asian Develop-
ment Bank '%'DB); the Government of Iran (Gri)5 and the International
Development Association (IDA); hereinafter c&al.e,d "the Lenders". In
advance of I .e incorporation and coming into opeiration of the Company, the
Government t.-:ugh the agency of the RPCPC. 'h  t.AsJrk:en t1he following steps
towards implei 3nting tlio Project.
1. Ac.;uired an area of' approximately 365C  acres on the

2. Employed a consulting   p              g of a joint
venture of the Sc:ientif¾io De.sign Cor!ipany Ltd.  (UK),
and James Cheuical Engineering  U ) o act as
Technical Advisor to t1he Comppanzt fo.c Implementation
of the project covering the desigp.   engineering,
construction and start -ip phtasem,
3.  Undertaken an exhau3tive prequalificatlon of firms
to be considered to bid for the turnkey contract for
the design, procureTnent and construction of the
project, and with tie assistance of the Technical
Advisor prepared tender documents for such contract.



ANNEX 4-6
Page 3
4. Entered into a contract with the Vinnel Corporation
(Alhambra-USA) in October 1974 for preparation of the
plant site preparatory to construction of the project.
The scope of work under this contract includes
dredging of materials from the bed of the Meghna River
so as to fill approximately 190 acres of the area of
the project site up to construction level; construction
of marginal embankments as required to hold the dredged
fill; and construction of e2nbankments for an approach
road to the plant site and a connecting road between the
plant site and the housing compound area. These works
are scheduled for completion by November 1975 thus
permitting plant construction work to be commenced
early 1976.
5.       These steps having been taken towards execution of the project, the
Company is now at the stage of calling bids for an Engineering Firm for the
prime design, procurement and construction contract. At the same time, the
Company wishes to appoint a suitably qualified and experienced firm (herein-
after called the Management Assistance Firm) to assist its staff in managing
the Company during the implementation and operation of the project. In this
regard it is envisaged that such assistance would take the form of a team of
experts provided by the Management Assistance Firm to assume key positions in
the senior and middle management organization of the Company with line respon-
sibility through to the Company's Managing Director. In addition to these
line responsibility positions it is also envisaged that the team should include
a limited number of advisors who would assume such advisory roles in relation
to certain key positions to be filled from the outset by Bangladesh nationals.
It is intended therefore that the management of the new Company shall be com-
posed of a blend of Bangladesh nationals and expatriate experts seconded from
the Management Assistance Firm. It is further intended that the senior and
mi'ddle management organization of the Company shall initially be adapted
to the needs of the Company in controlling the physical and financial progress
of construction of the project and shall be reorientated and expanded as
required to achieve a smooth and efficient transformation to the organiz-
ational needs of an ongoing urea manufacturing works as the construction
phase is completed. It is presently planned that participation of the
Management Assistance Firm will commence in the first quarter of 1975 and
continue through 2 to 3 years after plant start-up. During this period
the firm will in addition to its line and advisory responsibilities outlined
above carry out an appropriate training program aimed at ultimate take-over
of all positions within the Company by Bangladesh nationals. This program
will cover ongoing practical training which will be achieved by close
co-operation of expatriate experts and Bangladesh nationals in day-to-day
operations utilizing the relationship of "expatriate advisor" where a key
position is filled from the outset by a Bangladesh national, or of "Bang-
ladesh National understudy" where such a position is initially to be
filled by an expatriate expert and later assumed by a Bangladesh national.
Additionally the Management Assistance Firm will be required to undertake
a formal ongoing training program for staff in addition to the intensive
short duration, plant operation training to be given to key technical and
operational personnel under arrangements to be made with the general
contractor.



ANNEX 4-6

6.        For the implementation of the project the Company (including the
Management Assistance Firm) wilL be aided by the Technical Advisor who will,
in addition to preparing tender documents, undertake evaluation of bids for
the General Contract and subsequently monitor the detailed technical work
of the contractor, and by the Gemeral Contractor who will assume turnkey

role and responsibilities of the Management Assistance Firm as assumed by the
Individuals in its team working as part of the Company's organization are
described firstly by reference to the tentative organization charts shown



ANNEX 4-6
Tage 6
in Charts I and II attached hereto. The general form of the organization
which may be adopted by the Company entering the operating phase is as
shown in Chart I down to middls management level. This organization as
shown is divided into two grou:s (factory and finance) coming under a
Managing Director/General Manag er (directly responsible to the Board) who
would be a Bangladesh national having the assistance of an expatriate advisor.
Additionally a Training Manager (expatriate expert) would be directly
responsible to the General Manager.  The organization chart of Chart I
is indicative only at this stage, and is subject to later revisions. The
purpose of its inclusion in the;se Terms of Reference is to indicate the
scope of responsibilities required from the Management Assistance Firm
and not to define the organization which may be later adopted by the
Company. Management of the wcr ks would fall into three groups, namely
production, maintenance, and technical, each of which would be headed by
an expatriate manager reporting to the Factory Manager who would be a
Bangladesh national. Financia2 management of the Company would be init-
ially entrusted to an expatriate who would be assisted by a Chief Account-
ant, an Administrative Manager and Commercial Manager the latter two of
whom are expected to be expatriates. Under this basic framework the chart
shows 37 key positions 21 of which would initially be filled by experts
from the Management Assistance Firm either in a line position or in an
advisory role.  Chart II shows this organization developing through the
various phases of the project commencing from the stage when bids are called
for the General Contract, progressing through the design and construction
periods and leading into the operational phase. The chart shows the key
executive strength of the Company increasing from seven at the time of
award of the general contract to 13-24 during the construction phase and
finally to 37 at the commencement of operations. Chart II also shows the
transition of the positions and responsibilities prevailing during the
implementation phase to those irn the manufacturing phase and categorizes
each position as:
B   -  Position to be filled by Bangladesh national.
E/B - Position to be filled by expatriate expert with
Bengalee understudy.
B/E - Position to be filled by Bangladesh national with
expatriate advisor.
The overall schedule shown in Chart II covers up to 4 years for implement-
ation followed by 3 years operation, at the end of which the participation
of the Management Assistance Firm would be expected to be phased out and
all its experts replaced by BangLadesh nationals.
8.        In the framework of this tentative organization the general
responsibilities of these expatr:Late experts representing the Management
Assistance Firm can be defined a; follows:
1. Implementation Phase
Under the general direction of the Company's Managing Director
the Management Assistance Firm s1all form a project team headed by a Project
Manager who will act on behalf of the Company in all matters involving project
implementation where so authorized by the Company's chief executive.

BANGLADESH: ASHUGANJ FERTILIZER PROJECT
ALLOCATION OF PROCUREMENT
1.        The financing package covering the foreign exchange costs of
the project (para. 5.04) consistsof some tied and some untied funds as
follows:
In Millions of US Dollar Equivalent
Tied Funds          Untied `unds
IDA                                    33.0
ADB_-/                                 30.0
AIDi/              30
ODI42/             18
GOI                                    12.4
KFW                                    12.0
GOS                                     6.5
Total            4                   93.9
1/ Substantially untied--available for procurement in nearly all ADB member
countries.
2/ Available for procurement in USA and developing countries only.
5/ Only available for procuremflent in the UK.
In order to achieve most efficient use of these available funds
with resultant minimum project costs it becomes necessaxy to plan procurement
so that maximum flexibility in choice of supply sources is retained until
all necessary expenditures have been committed. In this way the situation
is avoided whereby towards the end of procurement it is found that only tied
funds remain whereas the goods still to the procured cannot be obtained at
competitive prices from the remaining supply source or in an extreme case
may not be available from that source at all. In the case of this project
it has been adjudged as by no means certain that the entire tied component
of the full financing package can be utilized in the normal course of inter-
national bidding, in which case some of these funds would remain after all
untied funds had been consumed. This being so it has been considered prudent
to hasten the use of the untied funds by preallocation of certain goods
and/or services to each tied fund source, ensuring at the same time that the
goods and/or services so preallocated can be competitively supplied from
the respective source countries.
2.        While such preallocation to the tied fund supply sources has been
necessary for most efficient use of the available finances as a whole, some
preallocation has also been adopted in the case of the untied fund sources
to reduce the administrative burden of administering a mixed pool of funds
on so complex a project. Thus it has been seen to be desirable to preallocate
the whole of the ammonia plant equipment on a f.o.b. basis to the ADB and the
whole of the urea plant equipment on a similar basis to the KfW. These two
segments of the project may, therefore, be separated from a procurement
administration aspect from the remainder of Uhe project and supervised by
the ADB and KfT,I respectively, thus relieving the other lenders of a con-
siderable area of procurement responsibility.



ANNEX 5-6
Page 2
3. Preallocation of procuremelnt for the project may be summarized as follows:
(a) Asian Developmenit Bank (Untied funds)
All battery limits ammonia plant equipment on ail (f.o.b.)
basis amounting to $30 million.
(b) KfW (Untied funds)
All battery lim:its Urea plant equipment on an (f.o.b.) basis
up to a value oi' $12 million.
(c)  US AID (Tied fuwds)
A package of equipment to the value of $12.6 million plus the
site dredging anud filling contract estimated to cost.$8.1
million making a total of $20.7 million. An amount of $9.3
million, therefore, remains which is anticipated tQ be won by
US companies after international competitive bidding.
(d) ODM (Tied funds)
A package of equipment amounting to $11.7 million leaving a
balance of $7.3 million which    is anticipated to be won
by UK companies after international bidding.  In the event,
however, that a UK firm wins the General Contract (Engineering
Firm), then thi.; preallocated equipment package will be with-
drawn and instead a portion of the value of the General Contract
will be allocated for UK financing with the balance to be financed
by IDA.

LICENSES, DUTIES, 1NIAND TRANSPORT AND CONTRACT APPROVAL
A. Import Licenses and Customs Duties
1.        The Govarnment will provride without delay all import licenses
for the importation of Project goods procured from foreign sources.
2.        Customs duties, at the rates in force from time to time (presently
from 25% to 60%), will be charged on the goods imported for the purposes of
the Project. To facilitate entry of the goods into Bangladesh and delivery
to site, the Government will implement the following procedure: Customs
duty will be assessed and become payable immediately upon the goods arrival,
or in the case of shipment by sea., upon presentation of shipping documents
(prior to the ship's arrival) to {;he appropriate Customs Authorities. Payment
of the duty will be facilitated by the establishment of a deposit or imprest
account for this purpose or such cother means acceptable to IDA. After payment
of duty and upon arrival of the goods by sea,, the goods will be unloaded to
cargo barges for transshipment to the site. Upon arrival of goods by air
and payment of duties against shipping documents, the goods will be promptly
transshipped to the plant site. IFpon arrival at site, the goods will be
unloaded to shore where they will be promptly inspected by Customs appraisers
(located at site at the expense of the Company) to determine that the goods
delivered to site correspond to the description of the goods in the shipping
documents against which Customs duty had been paid. Any adjustments in
Customs duty will be effected in due course, but the goods, after Customs
appraisal will be released from Customs control immediately and may be
utilized in the manner required for the Project.
B. Inland Water Transportation of Proj ect Goods
3.        To facilitate delivery of foreign Project goods to the site, they
will be promptly transshipped at the ports of entry from ocean-going vessels
to inland water cargo barges for direct shipment to the site. Upon adequate
notice to the Government of the type and quantity of Project goods required
to be shipped through inland water to the site, the Government will ensure the
timely availability, through its appropriate agencies, of cargo barges suitable
for such purpose. Should such cargo barges not be available, the Company
may take such steps as it consider3 fit to arrange for such shipment and the
Government will give all necessary assistance in this respect.
C. Procurement of Imported SDare Parts and Imported Consumable Stores
Required for the Operation of the Plantt
14.       In procuring the above-mentioned items, the Company may, at its
discretion, utilize the services oE BFCPC. The Government will ensure,
throughout the life of the Project, the availability of   sufficient foreign
exchange resources to permit the Company to make timely purchases of such
spare parts and stores as are requLred for the efficient functioning of the
Project, and will ensure the issuaice of such import licenses and provision
of such assistance as will enable -he spare parts and stores to be imported
into Bangladesh and delivered expeditiously to the site.

5.        The following procedures and rules shall apply'to the proposed
award of contracts by the Company and to all contracts to which the Company
is, or proposes to become, party for the purchase of goods and services in
connection with the execution of the Project. Such proposed awards and
contracts, the expenditures in respect of which are not estimated to exceed
taka ten lakhs (US$0.13 million) equivalent, shaU not be subject to any
domestic review or approval whatsoever, except by the Company, To the extent
the approval of any authority of the Government (the "Approving Authority")
may be required by law, the following procedures shall apply:
(a) If the Approving Authority approves the proposed award
of a contract, and such contract as agreed between the
Company and the successful bidder does not differ
substantially from that anticipated by the terms of
the proposed award and does not significantly alter
the obligations of the Company beyond those customarily
undertaken in connection with similar contracts (except
to the extent anticipated by such terms), then the Company
will not be required to submit for further review, or
obtain any further approval of, such contract and may
execute and deliver the same with legally binding effect.
(b) The Government shall convey its decision in respect of
any proposed contract award to the Company within
fourteen days of the date of receipt of the bid
evaluations, including the proposed award, from the
General Contractor by the Company's Dacca office.
Such award shall be assumed to have been approved,
and the Company (or if the Company so decides, by the
General Contractor for the benefit of the Company) may
proceed, upon compliance with any applicable requirement
of the schedule to the Project Agreement, to execute and
deliver the proposed oontract with legally binding effect,
if the Borrower's decision in respect of the proposed
contract award is not communicated to the Company within

BANGLADESH - ASHUGANJI FERTILIZER PROJECT
STAFFING, SALARY AND WAGE SCHEDULE
The factory wages and administrative salaries for the proposed ferti-
lizer plant are based on the recent (1973) recommendations of two commissions:
the national wage (factory) commission and the national salary (officers) com-
mission for public enterprises and government agencies.
The wage commission recommended that starting 1974/75, the starting
basic monthly wage rate for unskilled, semi-skilled and skilled workers be raised
by an average of 20%, 27% and 30% respectively, from the present levels in the
public chemical industries.  Annual wage increases of 3 to 5% are also recom-
mended. The maximum basic wage for each of the 3 classes of labor above are
roughly 150%, 165% and 175% of the starting rates, respectively.
In contrast to the large wage increases recommended for the factory
workers by the wage commission, the national commission on public salaries
recommended that the top management, officers, and professional personnel have
a maximum basic salary of Tk 2,000 per month. This -would mean a cut in the
salary of top level officers who are presently earning from Tk 2,500 to Tk 3,500
per month.
On the average, the middle mmnagement salary levels remain unchanged.
There are only slight reductions in the upper-middle levels and slight increases
in the lower-middle levels.
The reconmended salary levels for lower management, clerical and simrilar
employees are 15 to 25, higher than existing levels.  Annual salary increases of
2 to 7%, are also recommended.
In addition to the basic salaries and wages, fringe benefits such as
housing, transportation, medical and children's educational allowances, leave and
holiday pay, and retirement benefits are to be continued, but at slightly higher
rates than are presently provided.  Fcr manufacturing enterprises, the production
bonus system is also to be continued.
The operating staff of the fertilizer factory will fall under the
:ollowing salary or wage levels:

i/ The minimum and maximum salary or wage in each range. Strictly speaking,
there is a normal range and an extended range for each level. The maximum
shown above is for the extended range. The normal range provides for about
5 to 10 years of annual increases.
b/ Factory workers, foremen and technicians have a recommended range of 155 to 850.
Lower level administrative and clerical type personnel have a recommended range
of 130 - 975. Several grades of workers such as unskilled, semi-skilled and
skilled as well as 5 grades of employee salary levels have been combined.
The basic annual salary and wages for the proposed fertilizer plant are
roughly Tk 6.10 million. This is calculated based on a more detailed breakdown
of employees for each of 10 salary grades for administrative staff and each of 6
Wage grades for factory workers.  T'he mid-point of the normal range for each
salary or wage grade was used, representing roughly 5 years of annual increases
flrom the minimum salary or wage. This factor is judged to be sufficient to cover
any wage or salary escalation from 1974 to 1978 and allow for a mix of varying
experienced personnel in the initial staff.
Fringe benefits, as recormended in the commission reports, vary
according to location and grade level. Nevertheless, the recommended total
fringe benefit package is less than that experienced at the Ghorasal Fertilizer
factory. At this factory, fringe benefits for the entire staff comes to about
50% of the basic salaries and wages. This proportion is used in this report.
Fertilizer plants must provide incentives to attract qualified people to remote
places where the factory is located.

NOTES TO RECURRENT OPERATING COST ESTIMATES
Table
a/ For other than 90% capacity utilization, say X% multiply the fixed coat/
ton of urea (at 90% capacity) by the factor (;2i to get the fixed coat/
ton of urea at X% capacity utilization.
b/ If the factory will not have' a captive power plant (e.g. buys power from
the nearby power station), then gas consumption will only be 26,300 SCF/
ton of urea or $13.15 per ton of urea. However, the purchased power will
have the following operating cost contributionst
Power Cost
1) Variable cost contributicn (energy charge) = $l.6h/ton of urea
2) Fixed cost contribution (maximum demand charge)  = $152,660
per year or 0.32 per ton of urea at 90% output.
These costs are based on the followings
1) Mid-1974 energy charge for chemical industries is Tk 9.h0 ($1.25/
100 KWH. This is escalated by 59% (based on domeatic inflation
rates in Annex 6-8) to arrive at mid-1978 price.
2) Energy consumption is 82.6 KWH per ton of urea.
3) The maxi.m  power d_mand Is 6,000 KW per month.
4) The mid-1974 maximum powe:, demand charge is Tk 10.00/TW pwer month.
This is escalated by 59% wnd comes to an annual rate of 2.12 per
KW of maximus demand per :onth.
The contingency in the capitatl cost estimate contains $2.4 million
f.o.b. (escalated) for a pow3r plant, or a delivered cost of about
$3.4 million. The contribut-Lon of the captive power generator to the
annual depreciation charges -s about $0.3 mi-lion for 12 year.  The
contribution to the annual maintenance material and insurance expenses
is estimated at $0.1 million (total contribution to fixed cost is $0.4
million per year).
Without a captive power generator therefore, the operating cost would be:
1) Variable cost/ton of urea    =   $29.9h
2) Semi-variable coat            -  $0.28/ton of urea at 90% output
3) Annual.fixeit cost            .   $2h.2 million or $50.90/ton of
urea at 90% output
4) Total recurrent operating
cost                        =   $81.12/ton of urea at 90% output.

/ Based on Tk 3.72/MSCF for 1978 as set by the Government. The March 197h
price was Tk 1.60/hSCF. In early April, a proposal from the Titas Gas
Transmission Company to raise the price to Tk 2.32/MSCF by the latter
part of 1974 was approved by the Government.
d/ Based on mid- 1974 cif cost of US$1.10 per ton of urea. This
corresponds to approximately US$300,000 per year for chemicals and
US$500,000 per one set of catalysts ( aid- 1974 cif cost), implying an
average life of 2.25 years for the catalysts. Price escalation factor
(based on international inflation rates in Annex 6-8) to mid-1978
prices is 42%   Duties are 40% and local handling 3% of cif cost. The
2 sets (initial charge and spares) of catalysts included in the capital
cost estimate is valued at about US$1.2 million cif, based on
acquisition cost (US$1.8 million delivered). The mid-1978 cost of
catalysts and chemicals comes to US$2.23 per ton of urea, with chemicals
accounting for US$1.27 and catalysts about UE$0.96.
e/ Refer to Annex 6-4 for comparative cost of jute bags.
t/ The total annual salary is $0.813 million based on the proposed staffing
schedule with 1,182 jobs. The salary and wage levels are based on the
recommendations of two national commissions (the average of the minimu=
and the maximum salary/wage for each category was used). The average
annual salary comes to $687.82 per job. The production bonus is assumed
to be 1 month's salary at 80% output, 2 month's salary at 90% and 3
month's salary at 100% output. A minimum bonus of one month's salary is
provided for the first and second operating years.

k/ Insurance cost is taken as 0.33% of the capital cost ($249.h) excluding land
acquisition ($o.4), site preparation ($13.8), and management assistance ($7.9),
or US$227.3 million.
1/ The BFCPC overhead charges are based on the current allocation procedure.
Each enterprise is charged a proportion of the BFCPC total charges equal
to the ratio of the installed cost of the fixed assets of the enterprise
to the installed cost of the f-xed assets of all the EFCPC enterprises.



ANNEX 6-3
The installed or original cost of the fixed assets of all the existing
(1974) BFCPC enterprises is presently Tk 762 million (US$101.6 million).
The proposed fertilizer plant will have fixed assets installed at $216.9
Million.  (Capital cost $249.4 million less management assistance
including contingency of $7.9 million and the net working capital of
$20.8 million including $8.0 million for spares and 2 sets of catalysts
included in equipment cost estimates.) The local currency equivalent is
thus Tk 1,654 million.  Consequently, the proposed fertilizer plant will
bear about 68% of the total BFCPC overhead charges. The present (1972/73)
BFCPC overhead charges total Tk 6.0 million (although expenditures come
to only Tk 4.0 million).  This Tk 6.0 million is escalated by 50% to
TTk 9.0 million, and used as the base for the BFCPC overhead charges
against the proposed plant.
.1 Import duties or excise duties have been excluded. Izported materials,
such a catalysts, chemicals, P.E. chips and maintenance materials are
valued at their cif cost plus local handling at domestic market prices.
The shadow price of loca-1 labor, services, and goods are taken as equal
to the market prices (less excise taxes where appropriate). These are
converted to US dollars using the official exchange rate of Tk 7.50 per
US dollar. The economic price of natural gas is assumed to be identical
to the financial price of Tk 3.72 (US$050) per MSCF.

Notes to Bagging Coats
1/  Includes 60% for duties and $25/ton for local handling.  This implies a
c.i.f. mid-197h price of about $563 per ton of P.E, Chips.
2/  Liners made at the Fenchuganj Fertilizer Plant, as of mid-1974
sold for Tk 1.95 or $0.26 per bag to the (3horasal factory. This yields
a 197h purchased liner cost of $10.40 per ton of urea. A 42% escalation
to mid-1978 prices (based on international inflation rates in Annev >-9)
yields $14.77/ton of urea.  The assumed delivered price of P.E. chips is
about 2h% of this finished bag cost.
3/  The rationale for using jute bags is that (a) it is a local material; (b)
breakage is negligible; (c) the bags stack better (the plastic bags tend
to slide) and most important, the farmers want and in fact buy the used
bags from the retailers at Tk 0.50 per bag. The f.o.b. export price for
jute bags was Tk 2.80 per bag at the end of 1973. This is only Tk 0.30
per bag more than the delivered price to the local factory.  There has
been no study on the relative econcmnic advantage of either jute versus
heavy P.E. bags. This.will be one of the subjects to be investigated by
the fertilizer nar!tthn*'4istribution study.
4/  Capital and related charges, and also labor costs are included in the
total plant fixed (e.g., depreciation) charges and total plant labor
costs. The contingency portion of the capital cost estimates has pro-
vision for a plastic bag making facility. The proposed plant staffing
schedule includes labor for bag making.
i/ The heavy bags are 3.7 times thicker or heavier than the liner bags.
6/ An economic comparison between alternatives I and II will require
information concerning handling characteristics (e.g., breakage rates,
rebagging costs, stocking properties) which are partly dependent on
the distribution facilities. This will be investigated by the
if,rtilizer marketir.n and distribution study.  Asss'fming  howeve.r,
that handlinv characteristics for either alternative is acceptatle,
ther -thc follov:iry econo7ic costs are involved:



ANNEX 6-24
Page  3
Alternative II
Economic cost of P.3. chips = $8.20/ton of urea
Alternative I
a) Economic cost of chips   = $2.22/ton of urea
b) Shadow price of jute bags = $ x /ton of urea
For the alternatives to have equivalent economic costs (e.g., $8.20/ton
of urea) x = $5.98/ton of urea.
That is the shadow price of jute bags should be $0.15/bag. This is
roughlyV 32% of the escalated market price, converted at the official
rate of Tk 7.50 = US$1.00.

ANNEX 6-7
Page 1
BANGIADESH-ASHUGA.NJ FERTILIZER PROJECT
FINANCIAL ANALYSIS
A. Assumptions for Financial Projections
1.         The project is assumed to start comrercial operations August, 1978,
and a forecast period of twelve years to June 1990 is used. The factory is
depreciated over twelve years on a straight line basis. Capacity utilization
is estimated at 50% during the five months of 1978, 75% during the following
year and 90% thereafter. The production costs are as shown in Annex 6-3 and
represent estimated mid-1978 costs which, with the exception of
natural gas, are about 40-50% higher than prices prevailing in mid-1974. The
cost escalation is based on the assumed annual inflation rates shown in Annex
6-8. The long term debt of 142.3 million is onlent by the Government to AFCC
at 10% annual interest for fifteen years (starting December 1974) including a
five-year grace period. The debt is repaid in equal, semi-annual payments of
$7.11 million starting January 1, 1980, the start of the third operating year.
The final payment is made July of 1989. Interest is also paid semi-annually
on the outstanding balance, with the first payment on January 1, 1979, tg &over
interest charges for the three month period October to December of 1978.1/'
The corporate income tax rate is 55%, but operating losses can be carried forward
to offset taxable inceme during subsequent years.
2.         The cost structure of the natural gas is described in paras. 4 and
5 of Annex 7-1. A price of Tk 3.72 ($0.50) per MSCF is assumed in this
analysis. This price is about 60% higher than the late 1974 price and was set
by the Government as a basis for the projections and the gas purchase contract
between AFCO and the gas transmission coipany.
B. Urea Fertilizer Prices
3.         As of the middle of March 1074, urea fertilizer was priced as
follows:
Retail price    : $107 per metric ton.
Ex-Factory price: $103 per metric ton.
The distribution cost was subsidized by the Government, hence the spread
between the retail price and the ex-factory price was small. Towards the
end of March 1974, however, following the Government policy of a phased
reduction in subsidies (see Section B, Annex 3-3 for details), retail prices
were raised by almost 67% to $179 per metric ton to eliminate the Government
subsidy on urea and also to subsidize the sales of other types of fertilizers,
which are still retailed at prices below cost. The ex-factory price for the
existing plants have not been officially increased, but BFCPC has initiated
action in this direction.
1/ The interest during construction was calculated up to September 1978.



INNEX 6-7
Page 2
4.         During appraisal, the Government has agreed that the ex-factory
price will be set at a level suff:.cient to provide a minimum debt service
coverage of 1.5. A price of $155 per ton would be sufficient to satisfy this
criterion; it was suggested by th£e mission and accepted by the Government
as a basis for the financial analysis. This price is about 50% higher than
the  1974   level and is conservative, based on the expected prices that the
present factories may have to charge in early 1978. Increasing operating
costs for chemicals, spare parts, salaries and the scheduled overhaul of the
existing factories indicate that 1978 ex-factory prices may be more than $155
per metric ton. Nonetheless, the social objectives of the Government may
dictate keeping the price at about this level.
C. Cost Escalation Beyond 1978
5.         On the assumption that inflation rates for both the ex-factory
price and the production costs would be about the same, and the assurances
from the Government that the ex-factory prices will be set to meet a minimum
debt service coverage of 1.5, all costs and prices are kept at their mid-
1978 level throughout the twelve-year forecast period.
D. Financial Forecasts
6.         Annex 6-5 contains the 'projected financial statements.  A loss of
$3 million is anticipated for the initial five operating months because of
the assumed capacity utilization of 50%. This loss can be avoided if capacity
utilization reached 61%. This relatively high level of capacity utilization
is needed to breakeven during the period because part of the output, about
43,200 tons representing 8.2% of rated capacity, are used to build up the
finished goods inventory level. The initial operating loss is carried forward
to offset part of the following year 's taxable profit. Net profit is about
11% of gross revenue during the second year and 1.4% during the fourth year.
The percentage then improves by 0.8% during each subsequent year. The debt
service coverage ratio is 2.2 init-.ally and improves to 2.7 during the second
year.  It decrines to about 1.5 during the third year as full long-term debt
repayments coAmaence. But the ratio gradually improves to 1.6 by the fifth
year and 2.0 by the tenth year.
7.         The operating cash level. is determined by a minimum quick ratio of
1.2 or current ratio of 1.5 for ;ach of the projection years. However, a minimum
cash balance of $1.0 million is retained (see Annex 5-2) if the current or
quick ratio test indicates a smaller amount. In the balance sheets of Annex
6-5, no dividend payments or additional investments are assumed. Thus, retained
earnings are accumulated. Funds ir excess of the operating cash requirement
are isolated in the balance sheet as either funds available for distribution,
representing all of accumulated retained earnings, or as funds available for
investment, representing that portion of fixed assets converted into liquid
assets through a portion of the derreciation charges. These latter funds can
be used for fixed asset investments (e.g. expansion or renewal of equipment)
but cannot be paid out as dividends since they are not part of retained earnings.
The accumulation of these funds is fairly rapid during the intial four years,
starting at $2.5 million during the first year and reaching a cumulative total
of $2h.7 million during the fourth year.  There is an additional flow of about
$3.7 million during each subsequent year, up to the eleventh year.



AMNEX 6-7
Page 3
8.          The debt equity ratio is 58 :h3 after five months of operation
and gradually improves as shown in Annex 6-5. O the asswmptien that the
maximum dividend payments are made (i.e. all retained earnings are paid out),
then the debt/share capital ratio of Annex 6-5 should be used. This ratio
does not improve as fast as the debt equity ratio but is still very sound.
9.          Annex 6-6 provides several breakeven charts for the enterprise.
The capacity breakeven chart (Chart 1) gives the capacity utilization during
each year that is needed for either: (a) a profit breakeven or, (b) a cash
breakeven or, (c) a debt service coverage of 1.5, given an ex-factory price
of $155 per ton. The 1.5 debt service coverage curve in the chart gives the
capacity utilization that will provide a debt service coverage ratio of
exactly 1.5. Any capacity utilization above that curve will lead to a debt
service coverage ratio in excess of 1.5. A profit breakeven operation is
realized if sales revenues are exactly equal to full production costs (i.e.,
including depreciation and interest charges). Consequently, pre-tax profit
is zero. A cash breakeven operation is realized when the cash inflow from
sales revenue is exactly equal to the cash production cost (i.e., including
interest but excluding depreciation) plus the loan principal repayments.
At the cash-breakeven operation, the annual net cash inflow is zero. Any
capacity utilization below the profit breakeven curve will rsu.lt in an
operating loss. Similarly, any capacity utilization above the cash break-
even curve will generate a poaitive net cash inflow.
10.         Chart 2 of Annex 6-6 is the price breakeven chart.  It provides
the ex-factory price level that is necessary for a profit breakeven or a
cash breakeven or a 1.5 debt service coverage ratio operation, given the
capacity utilization for that particular year. The curve is interpreted in
the same manner as the capacity breakeven chart. For example, any price
level above the 1.5 debt service coverage price curve will result in a debt
service coverage ratio in excess of 1.5. That is, the gross cash generation
from sales will exceed the cash production costs and the loan principal re-
payments for that year by more than 50%. The cash breakeven price is
equivalent to a debt service coverage ratio of 1.0. That is, the gross cash
generation from sales will just equal the cash production costs and the loan
principal repayments.
11.         The profit breakeven price is less than $155 per metric ton,
except for the initial five month period. The 1.5 debt service coverage
price is about $155 per ton during the third year, but is less than $155 per
ton for all other years.
E. Financial Rate of Return and Sensitivity Analysis
12.         Capital costs are converted to mid-1978 constant dollars in
Annex 6-8 and the financial cost and benefit streams are shown in Annex 6-9.
Annex 6-10 contains the internal rates of return for the project under
different asmumptions. The rate of return is mildly sensitive to project
asumptions, with the exception of substantial cost overruns in the 20%
region or higher. The base rate of return (after taxes) assming an ex-



ANNEX 6-7
Page E 
factory price of $155 is 9.2%. The rate of return changes by about 1.1
percentage points for each $15 per ton change in the ex-factory price.
The before-tax rate of return is about 3-5 percentage points higher than
the after-tax level for an ex-factory price of $155 per ton. This
differential increases by about 0.7-1.0 percentage points for each $15
per ton increase in the price.
13.         The rate of return (after tax) is low relative to similar pro-
jects for the following reasons: (a) conservative assumptions about the
construction period, estimated at 52 months commencing from April 197h,
about  ten  months longer than other similar projects; (b) high capital
costs due to the price escalations in the capital equipment market, the
grassroots nature of the project and the import duties of ho%; (c) Con-
servative assumptiona about the ex-factory price; and (d) the high
corporate tax rate of 55%.
F. Financial Management and Product Pricing
1.         The import, product-Lon and distribution of fertilizers to the
district level are undertaken by Government enterprises. The pricing of
fertilizers at the various levels is also determined by the Government.
Since product pricing is the Ganoernment's function, while the financial
management of the project is thet responsibility of the enterprise, it is
important that the Government's pricing decisions are consistent with the
continued financial viability of' the project. It is therefore proposed
that the following financial guidelines be followed by the enterprise:
(a) the debt equity ratio should. not exceed 60:40; (b) the current ratio
and the debt service ratio should be at least 1.5:1 and dividends paid
only out of retained earnings subject to the above ratios; and (c) the
Government should set the ox-factory price at a level sufficient to meet
the debt service coverage ratio of 1.5:1.
15.         The financial guidelines, while indicating how prices should
be set in response to cost changes and liquidity considerations, does not
provide dircetions on how costs can be controlled and how high production
efficiency cin be achieved or su3tained. The productive bonus system
partly encournges high ^ipacity atilization, which is imperative.  The
methods for controlling coste and for obtaining high production efficiencies
and the design of an appropriate management system should be provided by the
expatriate management assistance team envisioned for this project.
16.         Costs can be properly controlled if they are monitored accurately
and if there are norms against wilch the factory operations can be compared.
The norms should preferably be batsed on efficient operating factories in a
competitive environment in both (leveloped and developing countries. To
monitor costs accurately, a cost accounting system will have to be instituted.
9uch a system must have sufficient detail and sufficiently short feedback
response to enable management to detect any adverse development as early as
possible. The expatriate managexient assistance in the area of financial
management would be expected to ostablish some system along these lines.

BANGIADESH - AS;,UGANJ FERTILIZER PROJECT
ECoIiOMIC ANALYSIS
A. Basis for Economic Analysis
1.        The economic analysis is based on 1978 economic operating costs as
shown in Annex 6-3, and a 1978 economic price of US$175 per ton of bagged
urea fertilizer.  This is roughly composed of an equivalent f.o.b. (Thdonezia
or Persian Gulf) price of $145 ler ton (bagged), plus a freight charge of
$25 per ton and $5 per ton for local port handling. This price is consistent
with the recent Bank forecasts. No adjustments for inland freight are made
since distribution costs from t1Le port of entry and from the plant site would
most likely be of the same order of magnitude. The economic wage rates are
assumed to be the same as the wage rates used in the financial analysis.
Since most of the labor employed in the project are skilled or management
personnel, end since the labor bill is not a large proportion of the total
economic production costs, this assumption is acceptable. Import duties and
the interest during construction are excluded from the economic capital
costs. The official foreign exchange rate of Tk 7.50 per US dollar is used
to convert local costs to foreign exchange units. Capital costs are con-
verted to mid-1978 dollars in Anaex 6-8.
B. The Shadow Price of Natural las
2.        There is no generally accepted method of estimating the shadow price
of exhaustible resources.  Conseluently, the more commonly used approach of
distinguishing between tradeable as opposed to non-tradeable commodities as
a basis for deriving shadow prices will be used.
3.        This report assumes thLt the natural gas is a non-tradeable
commodity. This judgement is based primarily on three factors: (a) The
present proven reserves of the inldividual gasfields are not large enough to
justify a liquified natural gas (tNG) facility; (b) Pooling of these fields
by a pipeline system is technically difficult or too expensive because of the
geography, river systems and soil characteristics; and (c) Bangladesh will
not import any additional crude oil or fuels as a result of the proposed
project since almost all economically and technically feasible substitution
of gas for fuel oil has been made.
4.        As of March 1974, the ratural gas price had the following component
per MSCF:
a. Well-head (producer's) price       Tk 0.50
b. Transmission charges               Tk 0.70
c.  Excise duty                       Tk 0.40
Total                        TkS1.60
5.        The Titas Gas Transemission and Distribution Company (TGTDC, a
public corporation), proposed to raise the transmission charges to Tk 1.42
per MSCF by mid-1974. This was sabsequently approved by the Government.



ANNEX 7-1
Page 2
For purposes of this project, however, a delivered price of Tk 3.72 per
MSCF (60% higher than the new price) was set by the Government and incor-
porated in the gas contract agreement between AFCC and TGTDC. No breakdown
of the excise duty component was projected. Since the Government sets the
gas price, owns the transmission company, and is part owner of the gasfields
operating company, it is difficult to estimate the market pricejand even as-
suming the gas is not tradeable, an economic price for that matter. Hence,
it will be assumed that the economic price is identical to the price used
in the financial analysis of Tk 3.72 (US$0.50) per MSCF.
6.        If the opposite assumption  that the gas is a tradeable commodity
is taken, then the gas might be priced at an energy basis of US$1.40 per
million BTU, which is equivalent to about US$9-10 per barrel of crude oil.
At US$1 .40 per million BTU, the Titas gas will be priced at about US$1.31
per MSCF as the average lower heating value of the gas is 938 BTU per SCF.

COMPARATIVE COST ADVANTAGE AND EFICIENCY OF IMPORT SUBSTITUTION
A. Introduction
1.        For projects with tradeable outputs (i.e., import substitutes
or export products), the concept of comparative advantage is generally
used for comparing the production efficiencies of different countries
with respect to these tradeable outputs. The theory of comparative
advantage is still evolving and several methodologies have been proposed.
Comparative advantage analysis is essentially derived from or related to,
the net present value (NPV) approach to economic analysis. Thus, it is
an alternative way of analyzing the economic desirability of projects, in
the same way that the net present value approach is an alternative, but
closely allied approach to the internal economic rate of return (IER)
method. However, the comparative advantage measures provide a better indi-
cator for inter-country comparisons as opposed to the global type of result
that the IER method yields. As an example, assume that urea fertilizer
projects (identical capacities) in Country A and Country B both have an
18% IER. This fact alone is not sufficient to form a judgement as to which
country has a more efficient project or comparative advantage. Should the
opportunity cost of capital be different, say 10% for Coumtry A and 15% for
Country B, then Country A would have a comparative advantage over Country
B. Thus, for projects whose outputs are in active international trade, and
certainly for export oriented proAects, some measure of comparative advan-
tage is desirable in addition to the IER measure. This is especially true
if comparisons of projects in different countries are necessary. Such
would be the case if the implementation of most of the planned p2rojects
could create a potential for large international surpluses (or undesirably
low world prices), threatening the foreign exchange earnings of some develop-
ing (producer) countries or reducing the economic viability of these import
substituting projects unless the number of projects are limited.
B. Domestic Resource Costs of Foreign Exchange Earned or Saved
2.        Following the methodology suggested by Brunol/, comparative advan-
tage will be measured in terms of the domestic resource costs (flRC) incurred
per unit of foreign exchange earned or saved. Comparative advantage is then
the efficiency with which the project transforms domestic resources into
foreign exchange. Within a multi-period framework, DRC is the ratio of the
discounted net present value of domeatic economic costs and benefits
(expressed in domestic currency), to the net preaent value of the economic

foreign exchange coats and benlefits (expressed in foreign exchange),
uwing the opportunity cost of capital as the discount factor. Thus,
all the information needed to calculate the DRC of a project is contained
in the information needed by &rn NPV calculation.  The cost and benefit
streams in an NPV calculation are simply separated into a domestic cost
or benefit component and a foreign exchange cost or benefit component.
3.        Suppose:
Rt   =  the opportunity cost of capital at period t.
Et   =  the shadow foreign exchange rate at period t,
expressed as units of local currency per unit
of foreign exchange.
Ft   =  the total foreign exchange factor (i.e., capital)
costs at period t, expressed in foreign exchange.
ft   =  the total foreign exchange operating input (e.g.,
raw materials) costs at period t, expressed in
foreign exchange.
Ut   -  the total ralue of the output at period t at world
(c.i.f. or f.o.b.) prices expressed in foreign
exchange.
Lt   =  the total domestic factor (i.e., capital) costs at
period t, expressed in local currency.
lt   =  the domest:Lc operating input costs net of the
domestic portion of the economic benefit of the
output at period t expressed in local currency.
(T + 1)    the number of periods (years) covered by the
economic analysis.
IRC is then defined as:
T          (Lt + it)
t~ = o(1 + RJO
(I) DRC  -
T          (ut - Ft - f
il        (1 ~+ Rt)t
t =0 
NPV (in domestic currency) is defined as:
T           (Ut - Ft - ft)Et - (Lt + lt)
(II) NPV  =       a(1 + t
t = o



Page 3
4.        The relation8hip between NPV and D1C can be derived under the
condition that the shadow exchange rate Et is constant for each period
(i-e., Et -). Utilising equations (I) and (II) and aasuming the
shadow exchange rate in identical for all periods:
T
(III) NPV  -      (E - DRC)            (Ut - Ft -ft)
t = o      (1+Rt)t
5.        From equation (ITI), the following holds:
(a)  If DRC  E  then  NPV  = 0
(b)  If iRC   E  then  NPV      0 0
(c)  If DRC  E  then NPV  >  0
6.        In general, the NPV criterion for project selection is to accept
the project if the NPV is greater than or equal to zero and to reject the
project otherwise. This is identical to accepting the project if the
1RC is less than or equal to the shadow exchange rate and rejecting the
project otherwise.
7.        The cost and benefit streams in foreign exchange and domestic
currency for the DRC computation are shown in Table 1.
C. Efficiency of Import Substitution
8.        For import substituting projects, the ratio of the DRC to the
shadow exchange rate I will be defined as the efficiency of import
substitution (EIS). The ratio of DRC to B is an absolute unitless ratio
and is interpreted as the units of domestic resources expressed in foreign
exchange required to save one unit of foreign exchange. For example, a
ratio of 0.6 iwplies US$60 equivalent of domestic resources are used by a
project to save (in the form of imports) US$100 in foreign exchange.
9.        The efficiency of import substitution can be used directly to
evaluate projects in the same way that the NPV or the DRC measures are
used. Furthermore, since the BIS incorporaSes both the opportunity cost
of capital and the shadow exchange rate, it can be used for inter-country
comparisons. In project appraisal, the different measures are used as
follows:
NPV                1110                  EIS
Value              Value                 Value             Action
(a) Zero or more       Less than or        Less than or          Accept
equal to B         equal to 1.0          Project
(b) Negative           Ureater than        More than 1.0         Reject

1.        For Bangladesh, the opportunity cost of capital is difficult to
estimate. Intuitively, one can ask what would be the minimum internal
economic rate of return acceptable to IDA for porjects in the country.
Considering the IER of past IDA financed projects in Bangladesh or similar
countries, 15% appears to be a reasonable cut-off point implying a range
of 10 to 15% for the opportunity cost of capital.  If 15% is used as a
rough estimate of the opportunity cost of capital, then the efficiency of
import substitution (EIS) would be 0.48 (say 0.5), at the official exchange
rate and 0.26 at the shadow exchange rate of Tk 1 per US dollar.  Within
the range of 10 to 15% for the opportunity cost of capital, the EIS would
range from 0.3 to 0.5 based on the official exchange rate. Thus, the
project represents a highly efficient scheme for transforming domestic
resources into foreign exchange savings.
a/ When the opportunity cost of capital is set equal to the internal rate of
return (IER), then NPV is zero, DRC is equal to the shadow exchange rate
and EIS is equal to one.
