Fertilizer Company Limited (ZFCL).
2.         The plant was mechanically completed in October 1981 but
commercial operations could start only by July 1, 1983 due to equipment
problems.  The amended closing date of the credits was June 30, 1985.  INI)

BANGLADESH - ASHUGANJ FERTILIZER PROJECT (CREDITS 527 AND 527-1-BD)
PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
HICHLIGHTF
1.        Chemical fertiLizer is a major input to agriculture, which is one
of the most important economic sectors in Bangladesh.  Further increases in
foodgrain production to reach and maintain self-sufficiency in food would
have to be achieved mainly through continuation of the present sound
policies and programs in agriculture and intensive cultivation requiring
further increases in fertilizer application.  In this context, the
Government has encouraged domestic production of nitrogenous fertilizers,
taking advantage of local natural gas reserves, to reach self-sufficiency
in nitrogenous fertilizer supplies (para 1.01-1.04).
2.        The Project was appraised by IDA, jointly with the Asian
Development Bank (ADB), the United States Agency for International
Development (USAID), and the United Kingdom's Overseas D)evelopment Ministry
(ODM) in March/April 1974, following a request by the Government of the
People's Republic of Bangladesh (GOB). The Project was to he implemented
by the Ashuganj Fertilizer and Chemical Company (AFCC), later renamed Zia
Fertilizer Company Limited (ZFCL). The Board approved an IDA credit of
US$33.0 million equivalent to GOB in January 1975.  The credit became
effective in December 1975. Several other multilateral and bilateral
donors also participated in financing the Project. When the Project
encountered substantial foreign exchange cost overruns due to delays in
project implementation and technical problems, the Board approved in June
1979 a supplementary credit of US$29.0 million equivalent (paras
2.02-2.03).
3.        The Project was designed to produce 528,000 tons per year (tpy)
of uirea and 305,250 tpy of intermediate ammonia. The Project uses the
indigenous natural gas as feedstock and fuel (para 2.06-2.07).
4.        The Project was owned by AFCC/ZFCL, who trained about 491
people. The project facilities were mechanically completed in October
1981, 43 months behind the original appraisal schedula, principally due to
delays in the selection of the general contractor and in procurement of
bulk materials, and the time taken in soil investigation and soil
compaction.  A longer than expected commissioning period of 20 months to
bring the units to full commercial operation phase, due to frequent plant
shutdowns arising from technical problems, further increased the overall
delay in the start of operations to 59 months. The main changes in the
prcject scope included dynamic compaction of soil to protecz. the plant
against earthquake risks and a second power generation unit to meet the
critical plant power requirements. The performance of the foreign
engineering and other consulting firms have been mixed.  This was partly
due to coordination problems, division of authority between the consultants
and AFCC, and the general contractor's lack of prior experience in



- vi -
engineering and constructing plants based on the selected processes in
developing countries. AFCC/ZFCL followed generally acceptable procurement
procedures for construction, equipment, erection and civil works. There
were, however, serious delivery problemns in the procurement of bulk
materials (para 3.01-3.16).
5.        The total project cost was US$433.3 million compared to the
original appraisal estimate of US$249.4 million (74% cost overrun) and the
reappraisal estimate of US$452.7 million (4% cost underrun).  The overall
cost overrun is mainly due to: (i) soil compaction and other unforeseen
construction costs; (ii) storage charges for equipment; (iii) delays in
implementation, especially in testing and commissioning; (iv) the changes
in construction strategies which were found necessary; and (v) the cost of
remedying the equipment defects and failures. Total financing reqlired was
met with equity provided by GOB (42.6%), IDA credits (15.9%), and other
long-term credits from multilateral and bilateral sources (4 1.5%) (para
3.18-3.21).
6.         ZFCL projects to maintain not below 90% capacity utilization
(475,200 tons of urea) beginning 1986/87, and expects that the market
demand for urea in Bangladesh will absorb such production. The financial
rate of return (FRR) for the Project is now estimated at 2% and 4.8% under
two scenarios: Case I--actual urea price which is assumed to remain
constant in the future, and Case II--urea price is assumed to have been
equal to international fob levels since the start of commercial production
in July 1983, and follow international trends in the future. The FRR was
estimated to be 13.8% at the time of original appraisal, and 11.0% at the
reappraisal stage. The low FRR is mainly due to (i) the low ex-factory
urea price set by the Government; (ii) long completion delays; (iii)
substantial cost overruns; and (iv) the increased cost of natural gas
without corresponding increases in output prices. The Government's policy
regarding ex-factory urea prices does not meet the understandings reached
with IDA. This issue has been raijed with the Government on several
occasions and also during the Project Completion Report preparation
mission.  Despite the adverse impact of the ielays in project
implementation, cost overruns and the Government's outnut pricing policy,
ZiFCL's financial position remains satisfactory. The estimated current
ratio for FY87 and beyond is above the required level of 1.5. ZFCL has not
met the required long-term debt/equity ratio of 60:40 in FY85. It is
however expected to become better than the required level in FY87 and
beyond. The debt service coverage ratio for FY87 and FY88 is estimated to
be 1.2 and 1.1, respectively, which is below the required level of 1.5
(para 4.03-5.08).
7.        The economic rate of return (ERR) is now computed at 7.5%
compared to the appraisal and reappraisal estimates of 21.2% and 10.0%,
respectively. The net annual foreign exchange savings to Bangladesh from
the Project are estimated to be about US$104 million (in constant 1984/85
dollars). In addition, the Project has contributed to substantial gains in
Bangladeshi capabilities, which would continue to be useful to the
fertilizer industry in Bangladesh (para 6.01-6.04).



- v_t -
8.        During the various stages of the Project, IDA has werked closely
with GOB, AFCC/ZFCL and their consultants, and contributed to arranging
financing, evolving project implementation arrangements, identifying
problems and in developing practical solutions. However, due to
inadequacies in project preparation, general contractirng arrangements and
in overall project management arrangements, the Project has suffered
significant delays in implementation and substantial cost overruns. The
experience in the Project brings out the importance of (i) selecting a
generUl contractor with extensive previous experience in engineering and
building plants in developing countries based on the selected processes;
and (ii) good project leadership to ensure successful project
implementation (para 7.01-8.06).

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
I. INTRODUCTION
1.01      Agriculture in Bangladesh accounts for about 50% of GDP, and
directly or indirectly for about 75% of employment and exports. In the
last few years, Bangladesh has achieved L,pressive successes in
agricultural development, with foodgrain production accelerating to nearly
4% per annum (p.a.), significanitly above the growth in population (2.6%
p.a.). However, in spite of the 60% increase in foodgrain production above
the 1973 level, domestic production is still short of requirements and
self-sufficiency may be reached only by the end of the decade. Even though
agricultural production has become more resilient to weather, natural
calamities continue to affect food availability, as was seen In the last
two years. As a result, high levels of food imports, amounting to about
2.6 million tons, were necessary in FY85. The successes achieved so far
have been mainly through the high priority given to agriculture by the
Government of Bangladesh (GOB), and implementation of basically sound
policies and programs.
1.02      Of the country's total geographical area of 35 mil1Lon acres and
cultivable area of 23 million acres, about 22.5 million acres are already
under cultivation.  About half of the cultivated area is also under
multiple cropping corresponding to a cropping intensity of about 150%.
Further increases in foodgrain production would, therefore, have to be
achieved mainly through intensive cultivation requiring further increases
in fertilizer application.
1.03      Successive development plans have given priority in the
allocation of public resources to agriculture.  Quick gestation, low cost
investments have been promoted in irrigation and flood control. The
government programs conltinue to provide adequate incentives to the
farmers. Subsidies in fertilizer, foodgrains and irrigation services have
been reduced substantially, and the role of the private sector in the
efficient distribution of key inputs to agriculture has been expanded. As
an important part of its agricultural program, the Government has expanded
fertilizer supplies through installation of additional domestic capacity
arnd rehabilitation of existing plants, taking advantage of the large
natural gas reserves providing economic feedstock for urea production.
1.04      Chemical fertilLzer consumption has grown substantiall.y since its
introduction in Bangladesh in 1958 and is expected to continue to grow at a
high rate.  Fertilizer con,;urmption increased at an average rate of lbout
12% p.a. froin 1974 to 1985 and reached abouit 1.26 million product tons in
FY85 equivalent to about 59(1,000 tons of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphate and
potash). The FY85 level of fertilizer application corresponds to about
26 kg per acre of gross cropped area. There are at present five fertilizer
plants in Bangladesh--all owned by public sector companits - with the
Bangladeshi Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) as the holding compaty.



-2-
In addition to Ashuganj, there are plants in operation at Ghorasal,
Fenchuganj and Chittagong. The combined capacities of all the four plants
is about 1 million tons per year (tpy) of urea, 13,200 tpy of ammonium
sulphate (AS) and 152,000 tpy of triple superphosphate (TSP). The FY85
domestic fertilizer production of about 800,000 tpy from the above plants
was about 63% of the total fertilizer distributed.  Additionally, A 100,000
tpy urea plant has been completed recently at Polash near Ghorasal with
technical and financial assistance from the People's Republic of China
(PRC). Another urea plant, equal in size to the Ashuganj plant, is being
set up at Chittagong, with IDA financing participation (Credit No. 1204-BD)
along with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and other donors.
.I. PROJECT BACKGROUND
A.   Project Identification, Preparation, Appraisal, Approval and Credit(s)
Effectiveness
2.01      The Project was originally conceived in 1970 by the Fast Pakistan
Industrial Development Corporation (EPIDC), as part of a larger
petrochemical complex, based on the domestic natural gas resource.
Following the formation of Bangladesh in 1972, the Bangladesh Fertilizer,
Chemical and Pharmaceutical Corporation (BFCPC), EPIDC's successor sponsor,
revised and presented the project proposal to IDA.  After extensive
discussions between the Governmeint, BFCPC and IDA, it was agreed that the
project scope will initially be limited to the ammonia/urea facilities, in
view of Bangladesh's resource constraints and the limited range of
petrochemical products that can be economically produced using
Banglandesh's essentially methane based natural gas.  DuriTng subsequent
project preparation missions in 1973, IDA assisted the Government and BFCPC
in developing and preparing a viable fertilizer project at Ashuganj. The
Project was being prepared soon after the formation of Bangladesh as an
independent country. The struggle that led to the independence and the
consequences had left behind considerable unce:tainties in the political
system and decision making capabilities. Project preparation and
implementation in such a period was not easy both for the consultants and
the financing agencies. The Project required a more than usual large
cofinancing consortium and external management assistance--both of which
had an adverse impact on. project implementation.
2.02      In view of the large financial needs of the Project, IDA also
assisted the Government in putting together the project financing package
with cofinancing from other donors. At the Government's request, IDA
invited, in September 1973, the following bilateral and multilateral
agencies to participate in financing of the Project: the ADB, USAID, the
United Kinglom's ODM, the Kreditanstalt fur Wiederaufbau (MfW) of the
Federal Republic of Germany, the Government of Switzerland (GOS) and the
Government of Iran (GOI).
2.03      The Project was appraised by TDA, ioinily with )NDB, USAID and ODM
in March/April 1974.  The Proiect entity, the Ashuiganj Fertilizer and
Ch.mnical Company (AFCC), was established in October I1974 to implement and



-  3  -
operate the Project. The Projert entity was later renamed Zia Fertilizer
Company Limited (ZFCL). The Board approved a credit (US$33.0 million
equivalent) on January 28, ;975 and the credit was signed on February 11,
1975. Due to delays in meeting the conditions of credit effectiveness,
including cross effectiveness with credits of the other donors, the credit
became effective only on December 19, 1975. As a result of the
implementation delays and the technical problems, the Project encountered
substantial foreign exchange cost overruns and IDA assisted the Government
in obtaining supplementary financiing for the Project,including an
additional IDA credit of US$29 million equivalent in May 1979. In addition
to the original donors to the Project, the European Economic Community's
Special Action Fund, the International Fund for Agricultural Development
(IFAD) and the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
participated in the supplementary financing. To ensure that the project
related activities proceed ,zithout delay or interruptions, GOB has utilized
US$8.2 million of the proceeds of the Tenth Import Program Credit No.
1194-BD and the Technical Assistance Credits No. 872-BD/1124-BD to finance
the import of spares and components and plant operation assistance.
2.04      The organizational arrangements for project execution at the time
of appraisal included the following: (a) AFCC as owner and executing
authority for the Project; (b) Technical Advisors (TA), who were engaged in
February 1974 to assist the Government in the preparation of the Project
and AFCC during implementation; (c) an engineering firm (general
contractor, GC) who would be responsible for design, engineering,
procurement, construction, erection and commissioning the plant; and (d)
the Management Assistance Firm (MAF) to provide management assistance to
AFCC during both project implementation and initial operation. The Project
was initially expected to be mechanically completed by March 1978 and
commissioned by July 1978--on the assumption that the general contractor
would have been contracted for, and would be able to start work, by June
1975.  However, due to delays in contracting and mobilization of the
project teams, progress was initially slow. The Project suffered further
delays, triggered by a number of technical and non-recurring problems, with
respect to site preparation and civil construction primarily due to seismic
risks identified during soil investigations in August 1976. Continuous
difficulties within the overall management of the Project and slow
decision-making exacerbated the adverse impact of the technical problems on
the project progress. As a result, during project implementation, it
became necessary to adopt changes in the initial organizational
arrangements for the project execution when needed.
2.05      Materials procurement and mobilization, generally critical to
project completion, were under reduced pressure due to the above delays.
The Project, however, suffered further construction delays and by December
1979, overall progress achieved was only 43%. The schedules were further
revised and the Project progress followed the revised schedule until about
1980, when material shortages especially of bulk items started to be
encountered due to short ordering of several items.  The Project was
mechanically completed in October 1981, about 43 months behind the
appraisal schedule (para 3.17). First produiction of urea was achieved in
December 1981, abotut 40 months behind the appraisal schedule.  Major



-4-
equipment problems and plant outages however resulted in further delays and
sustained production was not achieved until May 1983. The plant was
however put in commercial operation on July ., 1983. As a result of the
above difficulties in project implementation, the Project suffered
substantial cost overruns.   The actual project cost of US$433.3 million is
74% higher than the original appraisal estimate. Following further plant
repairs and modifications in October 1984, the plants have been performing
well at close to rated capacities.
B.   Project Description and Objectives
2.06      The Project, located at Ashuganj, about 60 kilometers (km) north-
east of Dhaka, includes a 925 tons per day (tpd) natural gas based ammonia
plant and a 1,600 tpd urea plant along with the necessary associated infra-
structure and offsite facilities and a housing colony. The Project was
designed to produce 528,000 tpy of urea and 305,250 tpy of intermediate
ammonia on a 330-day operating year basis. The Project is based on the use
of natural gas from the Titas and Habiganj gas fields as the feedstock and
energy source. Thke site, located on the eastern bank of the Meghna river,
had been reclaimed from the river bed through dredging and filling. Of the
total project site area of 130 acres, about half is used for the production
facilities and the rest for the housing colony. Even though there has been
substantial implementation delays and cost overruns, the facilities have
beeni built essentially as originally envisaged at the time of the
appraisal.
2.07      The mailL objective of the Project was to produce urea fertilizer
using indigenous natural gas, thereby reducing fertilizer imports and sav-
ing scarce foreign exchange.  As a major agricultuiral input, the increased
domestic fertilizer availability would assist in increasing food production
and furthering the objective of achieving food self-sufficiency. To a
limited extent, the Project has also generated some employment and upgraded
professional skills.
III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT
A.   Achievement of Project Objectives
3.01      The Project was mechanically completed in October 1981 and placed
in commercial prodaction on July 1, 1983. The total cost overrun was 73.7%
over the appraisal estimate. In FY84, the first year of operation (July
1983 to June 1984), the urea plant operated at an average capacity
utilization of 72%. Further repairs and modifications were carried out
during the scheduled shutdown in October 1984 and the plant has since been
operating at close to rated capacity. The Project has, therefore, achieved
the objective of providing domestic urea supplies based on locally
available natuiral gas, thereby, saving foreign exchange, although
considerably behind schedule. The Project has buiilt up a competent work
force of 1,100 Bangladeshis and assisted in accelerating economic
development in the region.



-5-
B.   Project Scope
3.02      The project facilities include a natural gas-based 925 tpd
capacity intermediate ammonia plant, a 1,600 tpd urea plant to convert the
above ammonia to prilled urea, and the related offsite and infrastrueture
units. The installed facilities are, generally, as envisaged during
project appraisal except for the following variations. As a result of the
findings of detailed soil investigations, critical areas of the plant site
were subjected to dynamic compaction to protect the facilities against
earthquake risks. Based on detailed analysis of the plant energy system
and the reliability of the grid power supply, it was decided to install a
second power generation unit to make the critical plant power requirements
independe.it of the less reliable national grid.
C.   Project Ownership and Management
3.03      As noted earlier, Ashuganj Fertilizer and Chemical Company
(AFCC), a fully government-owned company, was established in October 1974
to implement and subsequently operate the Project. The company's name was
later changed to Zia Fertilizer Company Limited (ZFCL). ZFCL organization
is shown in Annex 1. In view of the large size and technical sophistica-
tion of the Project, a joint venture consisting of a US and a l!K firm was
appointed to be Technical Advisors (TA), initially to BCIC and the
Government, and later to AFCC. The TA initially assisted AFCC in selecting
and contracting for the General Contractor (GC) and later in monitoring the
technical aspects of the Project.
3.04      To assist AFCC in efficiently implementing the Project and,
later, in successfully operating it, an experienced tUS operating company
was appointed as the Management Assistance Firm (1MAF). It was envisaged
that AFCC and MAF staff would man the project team positions and oversee
project implementation and plant operation. The team was led by an
expatriate project director who was expected to be delegated full authority
and responsibility on project related matters and report directly to the
AFCC managing director.
3.05      The GC was responsible for overall project implementation
including management, engineering, equipment and material procurement,
construction and commissioning management and all other services needed to
provide AFCC with a completely operating facility. Contractutally, the TA,
MAF and GC had varying obligations to assist AFCC in arranging for
training.
3.06      After the Ashuganj facilities were commissioned, the Government
decided to change the crganizational structure of AFCC consistent with the
needs of an operating plant. While maintaining its independent corporate
structure, the responsibility for coordinating and monitoring the
functioning of the AFCC was transferred by the Government to BCTC.  This
revised arrangement has been working satisfactorily.
D.   Manpower Development and Training
3.07      ZFCL (previouslv AFCC) at present employs about 1,100 persons
consisting of 7 managers, 171 technical/professional suipervisors, 64 other



-6-
supervisors, 398 skilled workers and 460 unskilled workers. Present total
staffing compares well with the project appraisal estimate of i,200
persons. Recognizing the limited technical base in Bangladesh from which
the personnel could have been recruited, the project preparation had placed
considerable emphasis on training. In the preparation of its training
plan, AFCC had the advice and support of all the consultants. AFCC's
training ?olicy considered that a selected group of core personnel was
needed to be trained intensively both within the country and abroad.
Consistent with the above policy, 55 maintenance, 46 production and 40
other personnel underwent intensive training. The training generally
included short periods of one to two months at the Bangladesh German
Technical Training Center to develop manual skills, followed by six to 12
months of in-plant training at the Ghorasal fertilizer plant. The core
technical personnel were then sent abroad, based on needs as identified,
for further training in similar sized fertilizer plants and suppliers'
manufacturing shops under arrangements made by the GC. At the suggestion
of the donors, AFCC's technical staff, particularly production personnel,
were trained at PUSRI's Bank financed training facilities at Palembang,
Indonesia.
3.08      A significant part of the project construction was carried out by
Bangladeshi personnel who had been hired and trained for the purpose. AFCC
benefitted from the skills gained by these personnel during construction
through employment of a large part of them as AFCC's regular staff.  AFCC
also set up a Training Center at the plant premises in January 1980 which
is equipped to upgrade the skills of maintenance workers. AFCC has so far
trained 350 technicians in the above training facilities.
3.09      During the project implementation period, several AFCC trained
technicians left the company for employment in the private sector or
outside Bangladesh, primarily the Middle East, dse to inadequate AFCC pay
levels. Even though AFCC shared the concern of the ionors on the need to
improve the salary levels to minimize the loss of trainr.  personnel, the
Government could not agree to significant salary increases. AFCC has,
however, introduced schemes to improve the fringe benefits and to provide
performance incentives. With the slackening of investments in the Middle
East, migration of trained Dersonnel is, also, no longer a serious problem.
E.   Performance of Consultants and Engineering Firms
3.10      As described earlier, initial project implementation arrangements
envisaged that AFCC would engage a Technical Advisor, a Management
Assistance Firm and a General Contractor to assist in the implementation of
the Project and its initial operation. During implementation, it became
necessary to adopt changes in the above arrangements. The performance of
the consultants and the General Contractor and the changes in arrangements
during project implementation are described below.
3.11      Technical Advisor (TA).  A joint venture of a LIK firm and a US
firm was engaged in February 1974 to provide technical assistance to the
Government in the preparation of the Project and to AFCC during
implementation.  As part of the project preparation, a soil study had been
carried out on the unfilled site, essentially to evaluate the overall site



-7-
conditions and to facilitate preparation of the specifications for dredging
and filling. The Project had provided for detailed soil investigations
after site preparation--to be arranged by the General Contractor (GC), to
obtain all the site data needed for design and engineering. However, this
study brought out potential site problems under the unusual combination of
conditions not anticipated earlier both by the TA and the Bank staff, which
required substantial additional site preparation work. Based on experience
in neighboring countries, the project preparation had assumed substantial
use of local construction capabilities in the project implementation, which
did not materialize due to the uncertain political and economic conditions
that prevailed in Bangladesh during the period. This had substantial
impact on project implementation and schedules due to the needs that
developed for shifts in implementation strategies and the resistance from
ZFCI/GOB to such changes. The TA's technical assistance during implementa-
tion was mainly in the areas of engineering and procurement and TA
performed satisfactorily in these areas. The contract with the TA expired
at the end of 1978 and was not extended since by then a major part of the
engineering and procurement work had already been completed.
3.12      Management Assistance Firm (MAF).  An extensive search was made
to identify an appropriate management assistance f :m to assist the Project
during implementation and initial operation. However, the response was
very limited due to the lack of interest of the better known manufacturing
companies in such tasks at that time and the uncertain economic and
political climate in Bangladesh in that period. AFCC contracted a US
fertilizer manufacturing company--with operating experience of fertilizer
plants though of smaller capacity than the Project and limited project
management experience, in November 1975 for management assistance during
both project imnplementation and initial operation.  The MAF personnel were
to take line positions and be fully integrated along with the AFCC
personnel into a team that would be led by the MAF-appointed project
director with full autlhority and responsibility.  This arrangement did not
work satisfactorily since (a) Z%CL/GOB subsequently became less supportive
of the arrangement, (b) the MAF could not gain the confidence of AFCC by
establishing their competence, and (c) AFCC was unwilling to delegate full
authority to an expatriate manager. The MAF also could not mobilize an
adequate team with substantial project implementacion experience. As a
result when the Project encountered substantial delays and cost overruns,
another US firm was contracted by UISAID to review the project performance
and advise on the needed measures. The company was later hired in November
1978 by AFCC to provide the project construction management services. It
was expected that the MAF will continue to provide the rest of the
management assistance services.
3.13      The relationship between AFCC and the MAF, however, further
deteriorated and, in May 1979, a Swiss consulting company along witlh an
Austrian manufacturing company was hired to replace the MAF as Operation
Assistance Firm (OAF) to assist ZFCL during commissioning and initial
operation of the facilities.  Whil tV?re were frequent differences between
ZFCL and OAF on the quality of sonie of the OAF personnel and on the size of
the appropriate OAF team, the arrangement worked well.  As a resul-t the OAF
continued to provide support. under extended contractual arrangement up to
June 1985.

3.14      General Contractor (GC).  Capabilities of potential firms were
evalue.ted and a short list of prequalified firms was prepared for purposes
of bid invitation. A FRG firm, which had been prequalified, conveyed its
unwillingness to take up d rect project responsibility in view of its other
work load and proposed working join:ly with a UK based firm as an alterna-
tive. Based on fi:i:ther review, the British firm was prequalified on the
basis of the comlined capabilities of the two firms and waS selected
following bid evaluation to take up total responsibility for project
implementation. The GC obtained the technology for ammonia and urea from a
FRG and a Dutch firm, respectively and carried out the engineering,
procurement, construction and commissioning services. The GC was
engineering the facilities based on the above technologies for the first
time, but was considered acceptable with the involvement of the FRG firm.
However, the involvements of the two partners were not defined adequately
and clearly.
3.15      As a result, while the project facilities are now performing
satisfactorily, there were long delays and serious commissioning problems.
Planning for the procurement of bulk materials such as steel structures,
anchor bolts, pipe and cable racks, pipes and fittings, insulation
materials and cables were deficient, often leading to hold ups in
construction waiting for the additional materials. The (,C's construction
plans had not fully taken into account the limited availability of local
subcontractors and skilled workers and its attempts to use more expatriate
subcontractors were not easily accepted by AFCC. Even when the facilities
were finally ready for commissioning, the plant experienced frequent
shutdowns due to various technical problems encountered in several items of
equipment. The deterioration in the working relationship between AFCC and
GC did not help to speed Up solutions to the problems.  AFCC has filed
claims against GC under international arbitration procedures for inadequate
contractual performance; the arbitration proceedings are still pending. As
a result the tests for performance guarantees of the plants have not yet
been undertaken.
F.   Procurement and Performance of Suppliers
3.16      The overall responsibility for project procurement rested with
the GC. The technical bid evaluations were reviewed by the TA and
the contract awards required AFCC approval.  The procurement was carried
out generally in accordance with the provisions set out in the
co-financiers' agreement. Since the orders for all time critical and major
equipment were placed during July 1976 and mid-1978 and the Project was
delayed due to the additional time taken for site compaction, no major
difficulties were encouLntered In the timelv delivery of the equipment and
machinery. Serious delivery problems were, however, encountered in the
ordering and delivery of bulk materials such as piping, electricals and
instruments.  Even though orders were placed for these items in late 1977,
there were several changes in quantities and specifications.  As a result,
insufficiently ordered items had to be reordered and procured during the
peak ot the procurement period ia early 198('. In some cases, there had
been as many as ten purchase order amnendments.  In several Instances,
chartered shipping and air freightinJg wis necessary to obtain the material

on time, resulting, according to ZFCL, in additional foreign exchange cost
of US$1.6 million. The initial team, at the GC's offices, of technical
experts from the TA and MAF was supplemented in mid-1976 with AFCC staff to
review and approve the technical evaluation. The GC recommendations,
however, had to be still sent to Dhaka for commercial approval and, as a
result, contract awards were considerably delayed. In July 1977, the team
was given the authority to approve awards up to US$150,000 and this limit
was increased to US$200,000 in April 1978 - a measure which improved
considerably the speed of procurement. About 48% of the IDA credits were
disbursed in the IUK - to finance a large part of the GC's reimbursable
costs. The rest of the amount was spread fairly evenly among equipment
suppliers for such projects (Annex 2). Overall, the equipment suppliers
performed satisfactorily and provided support to AFCC when plant problems
were encountered. In cases when plant failures were due to defective
equipment and the equipment warranties were still valid, the equipment
suppliers also carried out the repairs/modifications at their own costs.
In all other cases, the repairs were carried out by AFCC and the costs
claimed from the insurers.
G.   Project Implementation Schedule
3.17       The Project was mechanically completed in October 1981, about 43
months behind the appraisal schedule of March 1978, and about 13 months
behind the 1979 revised completion schedule of September 1980.1/ First
ammonia/urea production was achieved in December 1981, about 40 months
behind the appraisal scheduile and about 9 months behind the 1979 revised
schedu'le. However, due to production interruptions and plant problems,
sustained production was achieved only in May 1983. As noted earl]ier in
para 2.05, the plant was put in commercial operation on July 1, 1983 to
coincide with the beginning of the fiscal year 1983-84.  The project
implementationI schedule is shown in Annex 3.  The substantial delays in
project implementation were due to: (i) the initial delay of about six
months in finalizing the general contracting arrangements; (ii) a delay of
about 20 months in the start and completion of tthe factory civil work!c  due
to the time that was taken to evaluate the soil investigation reports,
evolve agreed solutions, and implement the dynamic soil compaction and
specialized foundation designs that became necessary; (iii) a delay of
seven months due to delays in the procurement of bulk materials, especially
quantities which were in excess of the initial estimates and items not
delivered due to labor problems in one of the suppliers works; and (iv) a
delay of about 10 months in plant commissioning and testing mainly due to
failures of a number of equipment and machines such as the package boiler,
ammonia storage tank, flue gas duct and refractory lining of the secondary
reformer. Following the partial plant repairs and modifications the plants

Annex 3, and are based on the actual appointment of the Technical
Advisers in February 1974 and the Project start date of April 1, 1974.
The Government's comments indicated that the tiiue spani for realization
of key milestones suich as the mechanical completion should he coiunted
from January 1, 1976, i.e., the effectiveness date of the first
Credit.  The Induistry practice however is to count it fromn the daite of

performned moderately well. After further plant repairs and modifications
in October 1∞84, the plants have been performing well at close to rated
capacities.

By June 1983, the Project had incurred a total cost of US$433.3 million,
which is 74% higher than the original appraisal estimates. The actual
project costs (expressed in US dollars) are, however, 4% lower than the
1979 revis-d estimates, mainly due to depreciation of the taka. The
various contributing factors for cost overruns are closely interrelated.
The higher actual project costs as shown in the Table on the following
page are mainly, directly or indirectly, due to (i) soil compaction and
other unforeseen construction costs, (ii) storage charges for equipment,
(iii) delays in implementation, especially in testing and commissioning,
(iv) che change in construction arrangements which were found necessary,
and (v) the cost of remedying the equipment defects and failures.

3.19     lWhile the identification of the earthquake problem, working out
an appropriate solution and carrying out the soil compaction were important
events which affected significantly the project schedule and cost, the
direct cost of the soil compaction itself was only about US$9 million.
However, there were substantial indirect costs. All the major equipment
had been ordered during August 1976 - July 1977 and their deliveries had to
be rescheduled to match the revised project schedules. As a result,
suppliers' warranties had to he renegotiated and in many cases the
equipment had to be warehoused abroad. The GC and MAF services had to be
continued for longer periods. The more elaborate foundation designs
adopted required substantial additional expatriate subcontracting. The
longer project implementation increased interest costs. All these -;esulted
in substantial cost increases in construction and erection (40.4%),
interest during construction (31.8%), equipment and materials (18.0%) and
building and structures (14.5%).
3.20      An additional factor which was responsible for the cost increases
in construction and erection was the substantial increase in foreign
subcontracting compared to appraisal estimates, as a result of the
inadequate availability of competent local subcontractors with the needed
construction equipment, and the difficulties the C,C had in hiring, training



-  12  -
and retainitig a competent local construction work force. 1/ As a result of
the higher cost of such subcontracting, the cost of construction and the
foreign component increased suhstantially. It was also necessary for the
Project to purchase more construction equipment. A large part of the
increased GC's reimbursable cost for construction supervision during the
longer implementation period is included under construction and erection.
3.21      The cumulative disbursement pattern for the IDA credits is shiown
in the Table below. The delays in the major project activities and in
project completion resulted in the diLbursement of IDA credits over a
longer period compared with the appraisal estimates and even the
reappraisai estimates. The disbursement schedule for the total project
cost is shown in Annex 4.

3.22      The actual project financing plan compared with the original

changes between the revised financing plan and the actual are the use of
funds from IDA's Tenth Import and Technical Assistance Credits for
financing the Project (US$8.2 million), a decrease in the Government's
contribution (US$6.2 million equivalent), and currency differences.
1/  Detailed estimates of the delay in mechanical completion are shown ,n
Annex 3, and are based on the actual appointment of the Technical
Advisers in February 1974 and the Project start date of April 1, 1974.
The Government's comments indicated that the time span for realization
of key milestones such as the mechanical completion should be counted
from January 1, 1976, i.e., the effectiveness date of the first
Ccedit.  The Tndustry practice however is to count it from the date of
award of a major contract sueh as for the Technical Advisury Stfrvices.

IV. OPERATING PERFORMANCE
A.   Commissioning and Start-up
4.01      As mentioned earl'er, the plant w&'s mechanically completed in
October 1981 and the first ammonia/urea were produced in Dece,aber 1981.
However, initial plant operations had many difficulties especially in the
11 months up to October 1982. In late October 1982, the plant encountered
serious failures with the process gas cooler and the superheater tubes of
the waste heat boiler and the plant had to be shut down while ZFCL arranged
for the repairs. During the first 11 months' operation, from December 1981
to October 1982, the plant could, therefore, produce about 115,000 tons of
urea (24% of the rated capacity). Mobilizing the material required and
carrying out the repairs took nearly six months and the plant was restarted
in April i983. Until the completion of major repairs during the scheduled
first turn-around in October 1984, ZFCL maintained operation of the plant
generally below 85% of the rated capacity since the condition of the
refractory lining was continuing to be the cause for concern.
B.   Build-up of Production

- 14 -
4.03      During the first year of commercial operation (FY84), the urea
production totalled about 379,100 tons, corresponding to 72% of the rated
capacity. During the first annual turnaround of October 1984, all
important modifications needed to build up production and maintain it at
close to rated capacity have been carried out. During FY85, the Project
produced about 414,500 tons of urea corresponding to about 79% of the rated
capacity. Between July 1985 and February 1986, while the plant continued
to operate at close to rated capacity, the plant had to be shut down in
March 1986 for repairs of the package boiler, refractories and other items
in the synthesis gas compressor area. As a result, the plant produced only
5,200 tons of urea (12% of the rated capacity) in March 1986. Production
in April 1986, however, increased to 27,770 tons of urea or 63% of the
rated capacity. ZFCL projects to maintain not below 90% capacity
utilization beginning 1986/87.  If the qualified personnel can continue to
be retained and competent new personnel hired and trained as needed and
there are no external constraints such as gas availability or foreign
exchange to finance maintenance imports, the Project should continue to
perform satisfactorily.
C.   Product Dispatch
4.04      The project output is transferred to the Bangladesh Agricultural
Development Corporation (BADC), which has the responsibiliLy for
marketing. Even though, initially, there were some transportation
constraints, the level of dispatches have improved touching around 40,000
tons per month.  ZFCI. expects that the nmarket demand for urea in Bangladesh
will absorb all productiorn from the plant (475  nOO tons of urea beginning
FY87).
V.   FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
A.   Fertilizer Pricing
5.01      Fertilizer prices ir Bangladesh are set by the Government at the
wholesale marketing level and at the ex-factory level. With a view co
promoting fertilizer consumption, the farm gate fertilizer prices have in
the past been generally maintained low. Since the prices were below
international prices, there was a resulting large fertilizer subsidy
impinging adversely on resources available for financing other essential
investments. Under an agreemnent with IDA in 1979, in the context of the
Fertilizer Import Credit (Cr. 944-BD), the Government agreed to eliminate
the fertilizer subsidy in stages by the end of FY85, later revised to FY86
under the Twelfth Imports Pcogram Credit (Cr. 1471-BD). Through a series
of increases in fertilizer sale prices during FY79 to H84, the fertilizer
subsidy has been reduced fromi 9% of the Annual Development Prograrr in FY79
to about 4% in FY84.  With the most recent adjustments in fertilizer sale
prices with effect from October 1, 1985, the economic subsidy on urea
(which accounts for two-thirds of fertilizer consurnotion in Bangladesh) has
b-n eliminated, and the economic subsidy on TSP and muriate of potash has
been reduced to about 14% and 1.8%, respectively.  The Government is



-  15  -
committed to revicuing the fertilizer sale prices frequently and adjusting
them as needed to ensure that there is no economic subsidy on such sales.
5.02      The Government periodically reviews the fertilizer production
costs of the fertilizer manufacturing units and sets the ex-factory
prices. Under the Ashuganj Fertilizer Project (Credit 527-BD), the
Governmnt had agreed to set the ex-factory prices at a level that will
provide at least a debt service coverage of 1.5 for AFCC/ZFCL, and yield a
reasonable return on equity. Based on discussions on ex-factory fertilizer
pricing in Bangladesh under the IDA-financed Fertilizer Industry
Rehabilitation Project (Credit 1023-BD), the Government had agreed to set
the ex-factory fertilizer prices for the Ashuganj facilities based on a
mutually agreed rate of return on equity, determined for this purpose as
net fixed assets suitably revalued from time to time plus current assets
for normal operations less accounts payable and borrowings. In subsequent
discussions, the Government has expressed concern that this basis could
result in a very high ex-factory price given the substantial delays in
project implementation and the excessive cost overruns. IDA is in
agreement with the GOB's above position, and as mutually agreed an
independent firm of Bangladeshi auditors have reviewed the project costs to
determine the appropriate capital cost which could provide a reasonable
basis for determining the ex-factory price. The report is heing evaltuated
by BCIC, ZFCL, and the Government before consultations with IDA.
5.03      The present urea ex-factory price of Ik 4,055/ton (US$133/ton),
after an increase of 5% in January 198 , in current prices, is in line with
the international fob price and arounrd 80% of the landed economic price of
urea. World price of urea is currentLy very low dule to a temporary
oversupplv situation.
5.04      The Government's policy regarding ex-factory urea prices does not
meet the understanding reached with IDA. The present price is insufficient
To achieve a debt service coverage of 1.5 and to provide a reasonable
return on equity, in spite of the recent good plant performance. This
issue has been raised with the Government on several occasions and also
during the Project Completion Report preparation mission. Following Lhe
BCIC, ZFCL, and the Government's review of the consultants' study on the
Project costs and revaluation of ZFCL's assets, IDA should undertake a
mission to discuss the results of the study and the matter of ex-factory
fertilizer price witli the Government again.
B.   Financial Rate of Return
5.05      The assumptions, productioni costs and the ouitput prices for
financial anid economic analyses are given in Annexes 7, 8, and 9. The
financial rate of return (FRR) for the Project has been calculated Linder
two different cases as given in Annex 10 and summarized below. In both
cases, actual input prices currently prevailing are taken and are assumed
to remain constant (in taka terms) during the project life.  All pr4ces are
expressed in 1984/85 constant taka terms.

FRR
Case I.   Actual urea price which is assumed to remain
constant (in 1984/85 constant taka terms)
during the project life.                                      2.0X
Case II   Urea price is assumed to have been equal to the
international fob levels since commercial
production on July 1, 1983, and follow
international trends during project life
(in 1984/85 US dollars converted into takas
using ,he FY85 average exchange rate of
US$1 - Tk 26).                                                4.8%
5.06       In both cases, the Project's FRR at 2.0% and 4.8% is much lower
than the appraisal estimate of 13.8% and the reappraisal estimate of 11.0%,
mainly due to (i) the low ex-factory urea price; (ii) long completion
delays and problems in plant commissioning; (iii) substantial cost
overruns; and (iv) the increased cost of natural gas without corresponding
increases in fertilizer prices. At appraisal, the cost of natural gas was
estimated at 9% of the urea ex-factory price, while it now represents about
14% of the urea ex-factory price due to significant increase in natural gas
prices in 1985 without corresponding adjustments in the urea price.
C.   Financial Results
5.07      Detailed financial statements of ZFCL are presented in Annex 11.

5.08      Despite the adverse impact of the delays in project
implementation, cosc overruns and the Government's output pricing policy,
ZFCL's financial position remains satisfactory.  The agreed financial
covenants require ZFCL to maintain a cu-rent ratio and a debt service
coverage ratio of at least 1.5 from 36 months after the start of commercial
operations, and a long-term debt/equity ratio of 60:40 or better. The
estimated current ratio for FY87 and beyond is above the required level.
The debt service coverage ratio during FY87 is estimated to be 1.2 which is
lower than the requited level. The long-term debt/equity ratio in FY84 and
FY85 at 60:40 and 67:33, respectively, was maintained because ZFCL delayed
loan repayments to GOB. In FY85, ZFCL adjusted its balance sheet to
reflect the increase in its long-term debt due to changes in the exchange
rates. The long-term debt/equity ratio for FY87 is however expected to
equal the required level, and become better in FY88 and beyond than the
required level.

VI. ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
A.   Economic Rate of Return
6.01       As mentioned earlier, the assumptions, production cost and output
price details are summarized-in Annexes 7, 8, and 9. For economic
analysis, all tradeable items have been priced based on the projected
international prices, and adjustments have been made for taxes and duties
for all costs. The economic cost and benefit streams are given in
Annex 12.
6.02       The economic rate of return (ERR) is now estimated at 7.5%, lower
than the appraisal and reappraisal estimates of 21.2% and 10.0%, respec-
tively. The main reasons for the low ERR are the long delays in project
completion and the cost overruns.
B.   Foreign Exchange Savings
6.03       The average foreign exchange value of the Project's production
with the facilities operating at 90% capacity is estimated to be US$107
million annually (in 1984/85 constant dollars). The annual foreign
exchange cost of maintenance materials, catalysts and chemicals, polyethy-
lene pellets and maintenance of technical assistance is expected to be in
the order of US$3 million. Therefore, the net annual foreign exchange
savings for Bangladesh are estimated to be US$104 million (in 1984/85
constant dollars) compared to the appraisal estimate of about US$87 million
(in 1984/85 constant dollars).
C.   Transfer of Technology
6.04       The Project has contributed to substantial gains in Bangladeshi
capabilities. Even though the Project was essentially designed, engineered
and implemented through expatriate assistance, Bangladeshi professional and
technical personnel participated in various parts of the Project, made
valuable contributions and gained useful experience. Bangladeshi
technicians recruited and trained for the Project were used for large
parts of the project construction activities. Bangladeshi operators and
technicians, with the guidance and support of the Project's advisors,
carried out the testing and commissioning of the facilities and
implemented the plant modifications when they became necessary. Thus,
working with specialists on various aspects of the Project, they have
gained considerable skills, which have contributed to the subsequent
successful operation of the plant facilities. The skills gained during the
Project by the Bangladeshi personnel have given them a confidence which
would continue to be useful to the fertilizer industry in Bangladesh.
D.   Environmental As1ects
6.05      The project facilities have been constructed in conformity with
environmental norms agreed during project appraisal, and are adequate. The
effluents control system in the plant is adequate and satisfactory.
Effluents from the cooling water system are treated to reduce the



- 19 -
hexavalent chromium in to the insoluble trivalent state. The treated
effltcnts after sedimentation are passed through drainage pipe into the
river. The chromium content in the final effluent is either not detectable
or is within the permissible limits. The urea plant has its own built-in
pollution control system, and its effluent to the river normally contains a
maximum of 50 ppm of ammonia and 200 ppm of urea, which is considered
within the safe limits. Effluent of the water demineralization unit is
neutralized in neutralization sump pits and then discharged into the river
within the permitted pH range. The main drain effluents from the plant are
regularly checked and monitored by taking samples as scheduled. The urea
prilling tower is well equipped with anti-pollution apparatus to reduce air
pollution.
VII. IDA ROLE
7.01      During the various stages of the Project, IDA has worked closely
with the Government, AFCC/ZFCL and their consultants, especially in
identifying problems as they arose and in evolving practical solutions.
Considerable initial efforts were necessary in developing project
implementat!on arTrngements consistent with financing from multiple
sources, organizational and infrastructural inadequacies in Bangladesh and
the problems in building up a new project entity. The project financing
arrangements to cover the foreign exchange requirements were coordinated by
IDA--both initially and iTl 1979 when the Project encountered cost
overruns. When the Project ran into site and power supply problems in
1976, IDA both at the staff and management levels worked with the
Government and the consultants in evolving appropriate solutions and in
having them implemented.
VIII. CONCLUSIONS AND LESSONS LEARNED
8.01      The Project is, at present, operating at satisfactory production
levels. As mentioned earlier, the Project did undergo significant delays
and substantial cost overruns, which will have to be considered in the
context of problems to be expected during project implementation under the
unsettled conditions of a newly independent country with very limited
infrastructure and industrial base. Implementation of this Project has,
therefore, provided experience from which valuable lessons can be learnt.
Responsibilities for project delays and cost overruns can be attributed
broadly to three areas: (i) inadequacies in project preparation; (ii)
general contracting arrangements; and (iii) overall project management
arrangements.
8.02      The experience of the Project has brought out the importance of
careful attention to all aspects of project preparation, since most
developing countries with limited reservoir of industrial experience are
not adequately equipped to handle unforeseeni project problems. While it is
to be recognized that the Bank staff and in most cases even the consultants
hired for project preparation may not have the expertise to evaluate and



- 20 -
prepare for all contingencies likely to occur during project implementa-
tion, it is necessary for them to be alert to potential problem areas.
This would enable them to identify, during project preparation, areas of
potential concern so that necessarv specialized expertise can be brought in
for project preparation. In the case of the Ashuganj Fertilizer Project,
such expertise could have benefitted the Project in two areas in minimizing
project implementation delays and substantial cost overruns. The Project
is on an earthquake prone site, reclaimed from the river bed by dredging
and filling. The potential risks of such a site were not, however,
recognized either by the Bank staff or the consultants during project
preparation and as a result timely arrangements were not made for competent
assistance in preparing and carrying out the site work. Similarly, both
the Bank staff and the consultants did not adequately recognize the very
limited subcontracting ^apabilities available in Bangladesh for the
specialized construction work especially under the uncertain conditions
that prevailed soon after the liberation of the country. A detailed study
of domestic capabilities would have possibly prepared both the ZFCL/GOB and
the donors for the more substantial foreign involvement in project
construction.
8.03       In a Project which has encountered substantial delays and cost
overruns, it is appropriate to review the adequacy of the general
contracting arrangements. As was mentioned in para 3.14, the general
contractor was selected following competitive procedures giving emphasis to
experience. The selected GC--a reputed UK based engineering contracting
firm, had not previously engineered and constructed a large ammnonia
complex. The above firm was, however, prequalified on the basis of its
working jointly with a prequalified FRG firm because of the general concern
that there would be limited interest for bidding for the Project in view of
the then construction boom in the Middle East. However, both the
consultants and the Bank staff did not specify the nature and extent of the
FRG firm's involvement needed to ensure successful project implementation.
The lack of earlier experience in implementing large ammonia/urea complexes
made it difficult for the GC to adequately plan the bulk material
requirements and organize for construction. Diffused project management
responsibilities, multiple sources of financing and a construction strategy
aiming excessively on limited locally available skills made the GC's job
even more difficult.  The experience in the Ashuganj Fertilizer Project
brings out the importance of selecting a GC who has extensive previous
experience in engineering and building plants in developing countries based
on the selected processes. The cost-plus arrangement of the general con-
tracting that was necessary under the prevailing contracting market condi-
tions of the mid-1970s did not also pr)ve satisfactory as it did not
include adequate incentives and penalties for obtaining timely and appro-
priate efforts by GC when the Project encountered difficulties. The over-
all contract management needed from the owner could also not be effectively
provided either by ZFCL or its consultants. In the context of the changed
contracting market conditions, a turn-key fixed price type of contracting
would be more appropriate for such a project und2r Bangladeshi conditions.
8.04       The foreign exchange costs of the Project were initially financed
with funds fron. seven sources (IDA, ADB, IJSAID, O0DM, Kfw, GOS and GOI).
7fne supplementary financing included three more sources (OPECi, IFAD and



-  21  -
EEC). The multiplicity of financing sources was essentially the result of
the needs of Bangladesh to obtain the entire foreign exchange requirements
from bilateral and multilateral institutions. But this arrangement intro-
duced multiplicity of procedures in procuring the goods and services and
added to difficulties in arriving at solutions when problems occurred in
view of the divergent views among the donors. There is need to avoid pro-
ject cofinancing with such a large number of agencies and for the donors to
agree on common procedures and leadership to speed up decisions.
8.05      The project preparation work included considerable efforts in
identifying the project implementation and operation requirements, the
extent of their availability in Bangladesh and the measures to supplement
them, wher3 needed, with external assistance. In practice, however, the
personnel assigned by the various firms did not meet the AFCC/ZFCL expecta-
tions and, therefore, could not win their confidence. As a result, they
could not fulfill the roles that were envisaged in project preparation.
Also, while the arrangements brought in professional skills, the Project
still lacked leadership, which was not forthcoming either from AFCC/ZFCT, or
the other firms. As a result, there were often a range of views, but no
decisions.  A review of the experience with the Ashuganj Fertilizer Project
as compared with the other projects in the South Asia region indicates that
a strong project leader plays an important part in successful project
implementation. If the project entity and its consultants do not find suchd
a project leader, the financing institutions should be willing to work with
the Government in identifying a competent leader and financing his costs.
The importance of such leadership came out clearlv in the Ashuganj
Fertilizer Project.  When the Project was still encountering implementation
delays, the Government's decision in early 1981 to positioin a competent
Bangladeslhi Project Director at Ashuganj with full coordination responsibi-
lity and adequate authority and ability/willingness to respond when needed
helped the Project to proceed satisfactorily towards its completion and
commissioning.

PROJECT COMPLETION REPORT
ASSUMPTIONS FtR FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
1.        All prices are expressed in 1984/85 constanit teras.
2.         For determining economic value of bagged urea at Ashuganj, US$35
is added to fob urea prices and US$12 is further added for port handling
and internal transportation. The economic prices of urea (fob), projected
by the Bank's Commodity Studies and Projections Division (January 1986) are
used.
3.         The economic value of natural gas in Bangladesh is 10w by world
standards due to the country's very large reserves relative to domnestic
demand for at least next decade, and the prospects for exports of massive
quantities of gas over the next several years, either on lanld (o
neighboring country(ies) or in other forms to other countries, are modest.
A US$1.25 per thousand standard cubic feet (mscf) has been used as the
opportunlty value of gas.
4.         All otiher local costs after deductirng of duties anld taxes are
converted tc 1984/85 constant dollars (using the 1984/85 exchange rate) and
assumed to remain constant in dollar terms.
5.         For financial rate of return, actual input prices are taken and
assumed to remain constant (in 1984/85 constant taka terms) for the life of
the Project.  The price of natural gas as of July 1, 1985 is assuirned to
remain constant at Tk 15.66/mscf; in 1984/85 taka terms, it is calculated
at Tk 13.98/mscf.  For output prices, two cases have been analyzed.  Under
Case I, actual output prices of urea, converted into 1984/85 constant taka
terms, have been used, and are further assumed to remain constant during
the Project life. Under the hypothetical Case II, output prices are
assumed to have been at international levels (fob) since commercial
operations (July 1983), and in the future are assumed to follow expected
international trends for fertilizer prices (in constant 1984/85 dollar
terms converted into takas using the 1984/85 exchange rate).
