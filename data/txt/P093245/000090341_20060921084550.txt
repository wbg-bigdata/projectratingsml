Objective and      The proposed Second Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO 11),the second
Description        o f three PRSOs, i s intended to continue to support the Government o f Georgia
                   with the implementation o f the reforms and policy priorities o f the Poverty
                   Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP, or Economic Development and Poverty
                   Reduction Program, EDPRP as it is known in Georgia). The proposed second
                   PRSO would support the objectives and the policies o f the EDPRP by: (i)
                   strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency; (ii)
                   improving electricity and gas sector services; (iii)improving the environment for
                   private sector development; and (iv) improving social protection, education and
                   health care services.

                   The second PRSO i s proposed to be extended on the basis o f policy and
                   institutional reform actions taken as agreed with IDA. The third PRSO would be
                   made available as further agreed triggers o f policy and institutional reform are
                   satisfied.

Benefits           There are several primary benefits o f this operation. First and foremost, the
                   proposed second PRSO supports further progress with anti-corruption efforts and
                   measures to continue improving governance which will improve efficiency and
                   transparency inthe use o f public resources and inthe investment climate, and will
                   deepen the access to and affordability o f key social services for the poor.
                   Furthermore, strengthenedpublic expenditure management and accountability will
                   continue to enhance the strategic allocation o f resources and contribute to fiscal
                   sustainability. Improved electricity and gas sector services will mitigate one o f the
                   key impediments to business andjob generation as well as contributing directly to
                   improved living standards for the poor, notably for those outside the capital. The
                   simplification and clarification o f rules and regulations governing business
                   activity will provide further stimulus to private sector activity. The reforms
                   envisaged in key social programs will improve the quality and targeting o f social
                   services and social protection for the poor and vulnerable. Under this second
                   PRSO, the Georgian authorities are introducing for the first time ever a targeted
                   social assistance program for the extreme poor. This i s a key measure to reduce
                   extreme poverty inGeorgia.

Risks              The Government's reform efforts face several risks.        One risk i s the limited
                   implementation capacity. This has been carefully factored into the design o f this
                   operation: notably, through a selective and programmatic approach. The
                   Government i s also making a strong effort to ensure policy consistency across
                   various initiatives and to address capacity weaknesses. The Government has
                   completed the PRSP Progress Report o f 2006 (August 2006) which has taken
                   stock o f the achievements to date and outlines the directions o f the reforms going

                   forward. This report i s aimed at consolidating the policy reforms o f the EDPRP,
                   the Individual Partnership Action Plan for joining NATO (PAP), the EU
                   Neighborhood Policy Action Plan and other policy documents.           Staffs o f the
                   World Bank and the IMF have prepared a Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) in
                   September 2006.       At the same time, the Government is actively addressing
                   capacity weaknesses. Donors including the World Bank are actively supporting
                   these initiatives. The PRSO program focuses on key areas in which donor
                   technical assistance i s ongoing and may be expanded in the near term. The task
                   team has consulted closely with other donors on the capacity-building support for
                   various reforms. Current plans include joint analytical work, technical assistance
                   and learninghaining activities. The Government and donors are preparing a joint
                   Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) framework derived from the current update o f
                   the EDPRP. The outcome and monitoring indicators proposed in the PRSO Ihave
                   been updated to reflect more accurately the indicators used by the Government
                   and to allow more timely reporting.

                   Georgia     faces    significant but manageable       macroeconomic     risks    and
                   vulnerabilities. On the domestic fiont these include: (i) public spending pressures
                   related to the forthcoming local electoral cycle; (ii)further acceleration in the
                   growth o f credit to the private sector; and (iii)a limited response o f domestic
                   investment and net job creation to the reforms. External risks and vulnerabilities
                   include: (i)further rises in energy prices; (ii)limited progress in trade and
                   investment diversification; (iii)lower than expected FDI and other private capital
                   flows. Provided prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms continue
                   to be implemented, these risks and vulnerabilities are manageable.
                   Other risks include deterioration in the political and/or security environment.
                   There i s a moderate risk o f reform fatigue among stakeholders in response to the
                   very rapid pace o f substantial changes being undertaken by the Government. The
                   continued popular support enjoyed by the President and the Government i s
                   important as are their systematic efforts to explain the rationale o f the reform
                   strategy, and the anticipated improvements in governance and living standards.
                   Continued support from the international community for broad-based consultation
                   and consensus building will be critical. Rekindled tensions in the regions o f
                   Abkhazia and South Ossetia raise the risk o f security issues. The resolution o f the
                   Adjara question i s a welcome development. It i s hoped that continued
                   international efforts will contribute to the peaceful resolution o f the remaining
                   territorial disputes.

       PROPOSEDSECOND POVERTY REDUCTION SUPPORT OPERATION
                                        TO GEORGIA



                                  I. INTRODUCTION


1.      The proposed Second Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO 11) to Georgia for
$20 millionequivalent is designed to continue supportingthe mediumterm reformprogram o f
the Government of Georgia under the framework o f the PRSP (or EDPRP as it is known in
Georgia).   The objectives o f the reform program include achieving and sustaining rapid
economic growth and development with a target o f real GDP growth o f at least 5 percent per
year, reducing extreme poverty from 13.5 percent in 2005 to 5 percent or less by 2015 and
reducing overall poverty from 39.4 percent in2005 to half o f it by 2015. The reform program
o f the Government o f Georgia i s anchored to making progress with its Action Plan under the
European Neighborhood Policy (Em) and its Individual Partnership Action Plan for joining
NATO (IPAP).

2.      The proposed operation i s the second o f three poverty reduction support operations
envisaged in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) discussed at the Board in September
2005. From the wide range o f reform areas beingimplemented by the Government, the PRSO
program focuses in key areas where the World Bank Group has a comparative advantage and
complements the work by other development partners.            The PRSO program focuses on
governance, growth, and poverty reduction reforms. For operational purposes the PRSO
program and hence the proposed Second Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO 11) are
built on four pillars: (i)strengthening public sector accountability,            efficiency, and
transparency; (ii)improving electricity and gas sector services; (iii)improving the
environment for private sector development; and (iv) improving social protection, education
and health care services. The PRSO program monitors the Millenium Development Goals
(MDGs).     This document and the accompanying updated Letter o f Development Policy
discuss progress in achieving the key objectives o f the Government's medium term reform
program.

3.      Table 1 presents the core reforms implemented under the PRSO program and a
summary o f a comparison of the original triggers and proposed prior actions o f PRSO 11. As
shown in the last column o f Table 1, in most cases where there has been a change in
conditionality it has been due to a faster pace o f reform than originally expected at the time o f
PRSO I (September 2005).          In the other cases, conditionality was adjusted to new
developments on the ground. Specifically, broad-based user surveys have been limited to
Education since at this point in time it i s far more useful to rely on independent or NGO
monitoring and reporting. The other case is that the pace o f civil service reform has been
adjusted to buildconsensus.

4.       The Government has maintained a macroeconomic framework that is supportive o f
growth with stability. Fiscal and external account deficits are sustainable and have over-
performed relative to program targets; inflation remains at single digits; and debt levels have
declined. Growth accelerated from 5.9 percent in 2004 to 9.3 percent in 2005. Inflation has
remained low at the single digit level, although it has accelerated inthe first halfo f 2006.

5.       In sharp contrast to previous years of macroeconomic mismanagement, over the last
two years macroeconomic policies in Georgia have shown a solid performance and a
remarkable ability to mitigate shocks. Despite severe shocks in 2005, including higher oil
prices, a shortfall in privatization receipts, unusually serious flooding, and an interruption in
energy supplies, the macroeconomic policy mix was able to safeguard stability and growth.
International market sentiment towards Georgia is improving. In 2005, Standard & Poors
gave a rating o f B+ to Georgia's long term foreign currency debt-the        first time Georgia's
sovereign debt was rated by an international rating agency.            A stable macroeconomic
framework has been supportive o f implementing structural reforms.

6.       The first pillar of the PRSO program focuses on governance reform in public
finances, oversight institutions, and the provision o f basic public services. The reforms in
public finances are anchored in actions taken in developing a results-oriented budget through
a medium term expenditure framework (MTEF) and in strengthening the links between
spending allocations and country priorities outlined inthe Basic Data and Directions program
o f the Government.     For the first time, Georgia has adopted clear rules and equalization
formulas for intergovernmental finances. To strengthen financial accountability management,
the actions taken include establishing a fully operational single Treasury account, expanding
coverage o f the Treasury rules and guidelines nationwide, and taking steps toward achieving
international standards in accounting and reporting. Reforms are improving transparency in
procurement, and important progress has been achieved in strengthening oversight
institutions, notably toward converting the Chamber o f Control into a supreme audit
institution. The Anti-Corruption Strategy developed and adopted under PRSO Iis being
implemented decisively in line with annual Action Plans.           In this first stage of public
administration reform, reforms are taking place in strategic public entities that interface with
the private sector including the Tax and Customs Administrations, and permit and licensing
agencies, and in the education sector. To complement the numerous surveys monitoring the
progress o f reforms, the Georgian authorities have undertaken a baseline survey to assess
point o f service corruption inthe education sector.

7.       The second pillar of the PRSO supports reforms intended to move the energy sector
towards efficiency and sustainability. The reforms are guided by the Medium-term Strategic
Action Plan (SAP) o f 2005 and its 2006 update. Better financial discipline in the sector, the
execution o fbasic investments, tariff adjustments, and improved collection rates have resulted
inamarkedimprovement inthe sector. Electricity service has improved substantiallyover the
last two years which in turn has contributed to significant improvements in tariff collection.
Electricity and gas tariff rates are near cost recovery levels. Tariff adjustments has been
accompanied by arrangements to protect vulnerable households.                  Furthermore, the
Government has adopted an organizational model for the gas market to allow for diversifying
domestic and international sources while enhancing competition. These improvements were



                                                 7

achieved despite various shocks in2005 including large increases inoil and gas prices and the
interruption o f energy supplies.

8.      The third pillar of the PRSO supports reforms aimed at developing a competitive
private sector and expanding the capacity o f the economy to generate jobs. The Government
undertook a bold tax reform and a major business de-regulation effort, adopted a modem
Customs Code and reorganized and re-staffed the Customs Office, and established new public
institutions responsible for implementing modem standards and accreditation. Georgia was
ranked byDoing Business in 2006 as the second country inthe world interms o f improvement
inits business environment during2005. And Doing Business in 2007 ranked Georgia as the
number one reformer worldwide with its ranking improving from one hundred twelfth place
thirty-second place.

9.       The fourth pillar of the PRSO supports improvements in social protection, education
andhealth care services. The Government has introduced for the first time a social assistance
program targeted to the extreme poor. Inaddition, the Government eliminated pension arrears
and now pensions are beingpaid infull and on time.

10.      The Government i s implementingcomprehensive reforms inthe education and health care
sectors aimed at improving the governance, quality and effectiveness o f social spending. Notably,
the introduction in 2005 o f nationwide university entrance examinations has virtually eliminated
the practice o f bribery for university admission. Georgia has adopted a per capita financing
formula across the education system aimed at reducing inequities and inefficiency in spending.
As a complement, the authorities have taken several measuresto strengthen quality assurance and
results monitoring including aiming the impressive goal o f being able to participate for the first
time in the current TIMSS and PIRLs international assessment exercises. At the same time,
Georgia has established criteria and processes by which teachers are being accredited and
licensed.

11.      In health care the Government is introducing a Basic Benefit Package (BBP)
composed o f a universal package o f health services available to the whole population and a
supplemental package o f services for the poor. Preparation i s under way to pilot the universal
package in two regions-Ajara        and hnereti.    The supplemental package has also been
budgeted for nationwide implementation in 2006. Similarly, the Primary Health Care master
plan has been developed and is expected to be adopted by the Cabinet inthe fall o f 2006.

12.      Together these reforms have resulted in an impressive improvement in governance in
Georgia (see Figure 1) and have been effective in curbing corruption. According to the 2005
World Bank-EBRD Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey (BEEPS-
2005), Georgia has seen the largest improvement in governance in the Europe and Central
Asia region. The recent World Bank study entitled Anti-corruption in Transition 3 (2006)
reports that Georgia achieved the largest reductions in corruption among all transition
countries for 2002 and 2005.       Firms report that both administrative corruption and state
capture have fallen markedly and that corruption i s far less o f a problem in doing business.
Similarly, other indicators show improved investor sentiment towards Georgia including
growth in non-pipeline foreign direct investment from US$95 million in 2003 to US$240
million in2005.

Box 1. Georgia's ReformProgram I s Anchored in Improving Governance.

       The PRSO relies on two intertwined dimensions to support the Government's reform strategy to curb corruption
and improve governance. One dimension focuses on measures to curb corruption at the sectoral level. InPillar 1, public
expenditure policy reforms will improve the budgetary process and efficiency and transparency in the use o f public
resources. InPillar 2, the reforms are aimed at improving the financial viability and the service o f the electricity and gas
sectors. By improving financial discipline and the institutional framework, the reforms will also enhance the governance
dimensions in the sector. In Pillar 3, the reforms, particularly the modernization and simplification o f the regulatory
regime, will improve the environment for private sector development and will also reduce the scope for corruption o n
both the demand and the supply side. And in Pillar 4, the reforms will improve social protection, education, and health
care services. Important anti-corruption and governance dimensions are embedded inthe reforms ineach o f these areas.
For example, in education, the adoption o f monitorable examinations is not only improving the quality o f outcomes in
education but has also substantially reduced the corrupt practices o f the past that were related to grading and professional
degrees.
       A second dimension o f the PRSO is its support o f the Government's National Anti-Corruption Strategy and its
implementation inPRSO I1and later in PRSO 111. The strategy will provide a systematic approach to curb corruption at
the national level and hence it is an essential complement o f anti-corruption and governance reforms embedded at the
sectoral level.   The strategy includes such measures as strengthening the control bodies in the three branches o f
government, as well as establishing a strong monitoring system for tracking progress in addressing corruption.

       However, it must be noted that the Government's governance reform program is far broader than the PRSO
program. The Government's reform program includes judiciary reform, financial sector reform, labor market reform,
land reform, and other reforms which are not covered by the PRSO program. As shown inthe figure ,results to date are
impressive. The figure shows improvements in 13 o f the 21 areas. However, there are important challenges going
forward.    First there are important challenges in the functioning o f the judiciary, regulatory uncertainty, and anti-
competitive practices. And second, despite the impressive progress to date in many areas, Georgia still lags behind
average performance levels inEurope and Central Asia inthe predictability and reliability o f the regulatory framework, a
competitive environment, the functioning o f the judiciary, and transport. Two dimensions o f the reform program are
central: strengthening the rule o f law and making long lasting institutional changes to the role o f the state.


                                                                    10

13.     As noted in Box 1, the Government's program is anchored in improving governance.
Hence, the Government's program has a wider range o f areas than that o f the PRSO. The
Government's reform program covers judiciary reform, financial sector reform, labor market
reform, land reform and other areas which not covered by the PRSO. The PRSO program
focuses on areas where the Bank has a comparative advantage and complements the work o f
other development partners. For example, the PRSO supports reforms aimed at strengthening
oversight institutions such as the Chamber o f Control and the State Procurement Agency.
This work complements that o f the Government's efforts to strengthen the Parliament which
are being supported by the Dutch Government and the European Commission. Inother areas,
the World Bank i s leveraging its resources and effectiveness by working closely with the
Dutch Government, the IMF, and the European Commission in the area o f public finance
management reform.

14.     As illustrated by Figure 1 and Box 1, the progress in the government's broad
governance reform agenda as illustrated by its results is impressive. The Government has
implementedbold reforms at a fast pace and the results indicate that ingeneral the direction o f
the reforms is on the correct path. As the Letter of Development notes, the challenge i s to
maintain the reform momentum.

15.     Over the next few years the Government's reform program, supported by the PRSO
program, aims at translating these early gains into lasting institutional changes. Provided the
prudent macroeconomic management and the implementation of structural reforms continue,
Georgia's development and poverty reduction prospects are very positive given the depth and
scope o f the reforms implementedthus far.


                                11.     COUNTRYCONTEXT

A.      Political Background

16.     Since the current Government came took office two and a half years ago, Georgia has
witnessed significant political and economic developments. The peaceful "Rose Revolution"
o f late November 2003 was a popular uprising against years o f mismanagement and
corruption in government, triggered by frustration over fraudulent abuses in parliamentary
elections. Presidential elections were held in early January 2004 and the new President,
Mikheil Saakashvili, obtained 97 percent o f the votes in an election considered by domestic
and international monitors as largely corruption-free. Parliamentary elections held in March
2004 gave the ruling coalition an overwhelming majority. With a strong political mandate,
the Government has been implementingbold reforms to fight corruption, reduce the burden o f
the state on the economy, move the energy sector towards efficiency and sustainability, set the
foundations to improve the employment and living standards o f Georgians, and develop a
fiscally sustainable social safety net. The Government has stated its determination to maintain
the reform efforts o f the medium term program, which includes all the areas covered by the
PRSO program.

17.     Despite the decline in approval rating since 2003, political analysts note that based on
recent polls President Saakhasvili remains the most popular leader in the political arena in
Georgia. Recent polls indicate that he would be re-elected if voting were held today. Local

                                              11

elections are scheduled for late 2006 and parliamentary elections for 2008. The Government
has reiterated its determination to persevere inits reform efforts, including those areas covered
by the PRSOprogram.


B.       EconomicBackground

18.      Until2004, Georgiawas one ofthe poorest performing economies and had one ofthe
weakest governance frameworks o f the Europe and Central Asia region. The first 13 years o f
transition in Georgia were marked by unsustained reform efforts that contributed to growing
corruption and ended in a failed state. The years o f transition were marked by civil conflict,
lack o f macroeconomic discipline, a slow pace o f structural reforms, and massive external
borrowing.    Following an earlier hyperinflation period, in 1994 there was a short-lived
stabilization and structural reform effort. However, corruption was already pervasive and
undermined reform efforts. During 1989-97, Georgia had one o f the lowest tax revenues to
GDP ratios among the transition economies (averaging 3-8 percent compared with 26-31
percent inthe Baltic and CIS countries). Many Georgians had to pay government officials but
these payments did not reach the Treasury and hence the state did not have the resources to
provide basic public goods and services.        This reflected the widespread corruption and
significant weaknesses inthe rule o f law. Moreover, the deterioration in living standards was
further exacerbated by non-payment o f pensions and wages, a sharp deterioration in public
services, in particular electricity, and the growing impact o f corruption on everyday life.
These conditions created a fertile environment for the peacefulRose Revolution inlate 2003.

19.      Upon taking office in January 2004, the new Government responded decisively to its
mandate to curb corruption and improve Georgia's development prospects. First, its anti-
corruption effort and the agenda to establish strong mechanisms o f accountability and
transparency cut across all areas o f the Government's bold reform program,             which i s
adapting to Georgian conditions certain best practices, such as those from New Zealand (on
state reform), Ireland (on de-regulation) and Estonia (on social sectors). Second, the reform
strategy aims at developing a dynamic and competitive private sector to be the main engine o f
growth, with the state playing a supportive role by providing basic public goods and services.
And third, the Government is implementing reforms to ensure that the population benefits
from growth by focusing on detailed measures to improve education and health care delivery
and by developing an effectively targeted social safety net to protect the extreme poor. The
institutional and structuralreforms are beingsupported by prudent macroeconomic policies.

C.       RecentEconomicDevelopments

20.      Macroeconomic management in Georgia continues to show solid performance and a
remarkable ability to mitigate shocks. Despite unusually severe shocks in2005 and inthe first
half o f 2006, the Georgian authorities implemented an appropriate mix o f fiscal and monetary
policies and have safeguarded stability and supported growth. The authorities have adeptly
contained the fiscal deficit to 2.4 percent o f GDP compared to the 4.8 percent envisioned in
the PRGF program, in large part through sustained improvements in revenue collection and
through postponing some o f the originally planned increases inpublic investment for 2005 to
2006.    As a result o f prudent macroeconomic policies and implementation o f structural
reforms, growth has remained strong in2005 and first halfo f 2006.

                                                12

21.     Inthe first half of 2006, macroeconomic balances remained broadly in line with the
macroeconomic program and economic growth remained strong. Inflation remained at single
digit levels in 2005 but accelerated in the first half o f 2006. Headline inflation in 2005
remained at single digit levels and declined to 6.2 percent year-on-year in 2005 from 7.5
percent year-on-year in 2004. Core inflation for 2005 remained low at around 2.7 percent y-
on-y. However, inflation accelerated inthe first halfo f 2006, reaching 14.5 percent as of end-
July before it started to decline with an end-August rate o f 13.4 percent. While the monetary
targets o f the macroeconomic program were achieved, the expansion of monetary aggregates
and higher energy prices contributed to a rise ininflation. To safeguard stability, the Georgian
authorities are implementing an appropriate mix o f tighteningmonetary and fiscal policies.

22.     Prudent macroeconomic policies and effective anti-conuption measures have
increased confidence on the part o f businesses and consumers. As a result, monetization in
the economy is improving as is reflected by increases o f M 3 to GDP from 12 percent o f GDP
in2002 to 16.5 percent in2005. At the sametime, albeit from very low levels, there is arapid
expansion o f credit from 8.3 percent o f GDP in 2002 to 15 percent in 2005. Inparallel, the
trend o f consolidation in the banking sector continues. The expansion o f credit i s being
accompanied by rapid expansion o f construction and increases in asset prices.               These
monetary and financial developments pose important challenges to Georgia's supervisory
capacity andto the macroeconomic managemento f credit boom-cum-asset price increases.

23.     Going forward, key reforms in the banking sector include: (i)upgrading banking
supervisory policy; (ii)strengthening the implementation o f Base1 Core Principles for
Effective Banking Supervision, particularly the requirements for Fit and Proper Criteria for
bank administrators and large shareholders; (iii)strengthening banking sector transparency;
and (iv) continuing the closing and/or merging o f commercial banks that do not comply with
prudential regulations. The developments and challenges in monetary policy and the banking
sector are being addressed primarily by Georgia's PRGF program with the IMF. These
reforms are central to reduce vulnerabilities to the changing structure o f external capital flows.

24.     The external current account deficit has remained high and largely financed by FDI,
other private capital flows, and official inflows. The corrective measures, undertaken in
response to shocks, narrowed the current account deficit to 6 percent o f GDP in 2005
compared to the deficit o f 8.4 percent observed in 2004. With the completion o f the pipeline
its corresponding foreign direct investment (FDI) has also started to decline. However, the
higher energy prices, rapid growth o f imports o f consumption and capital goods, and slower
pace o f growth o f exports, the external current account deficit widened in the first half o f
2006.    FDI and other private capital flows and official flows are financing the external
balance.

25.     Debt burden indicators continue to improve. The stock o f public external debt was
substantially reduced from 36 percent of GDP in 2004 to 27 percent in 2005 following a
second round o f Paris Club rescheduling in mid-2004 and the discipline over the last two
years o f refraining from contracting non-concessional debt.         Georgian authorities have
completed their negotiations with the majority o f non-Paris Club members including
Turkmenistan, where the remaining arrears have been reduced from about US$l55 million to


                                               13

US$88.5 million. Debt service to exports o f goods and services has fallen from 9.5 percent in
2004 to 8.7 percent in 2005. Having followed prudent macroeconomic policies over the last
three years and with debt indicators improving, Georgia's sovereign debt was rated at B+ for
the first time by StandardPoors inDecember 2005.

26.     As a result o f prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms, and despite the
unusually severe shocks o f 2005 and the first half o f 2006, including unusually serious
flooding, higher oil prices and the interruption o f energy supplies, economic performance
continues to be strong. GDP growth accelerated from 5.9 percent in 2004 to 9.3 percent in
2005. Growth remained strong inthe first half o f 2006-8.4       percent compared to 7.5 percent
in 2005 during the same period.        Growth i s being led by strong growth in agriculture,
construction, and the financial sector. On the demand side, growth continues to be drivenby
consumption andpublic investment.

27.     Measures to curb corruption, tax reform, and improvements in the business climate,
combined with a stable macroeconomic framework, have contributed to rising tax revenue
collection and higher growth.      The reforms have turned a large corruption tax into tax
revenues which are now used by the state to provide basic public goods and services. Thanks
inlarge part to sustainedimprovements inrevenue collection, the Government has been able
to implement strategic investments in the transport and electricity sectors which in turn have
contributed to a strong growthperformance by the private sector. Public capital expenditures
increased from 2.4 percent o f GDP in 2004 to close to 5 percent in 2005, notwithstanding
some postponements to mitigate the impact o f the economic shocks.            Provided prudent
macroeconomic policies are maintained and the structural reform program is implemented,
Georgia's mediumterm prospects are favorable.


D.      MacroeconomicOutlook and Debt Sustainability

28.     Georgia's mediumterm prospects remain favorable. Real GDP growth is projected to
moderate to around 7.5 percent in 2006 partly due to higher oil prices. An average growth o f
at least 5 percent i s envisaged during 2007-09 (Table 2). Continued efforts to increase tax
revenues should sustain the overall government deficit at around 2.1 percent o f GDP (on a
commitment basis) in2006, while the clearance o f the remaining expenditure arrears o f about
0.4 percent o f GDP will raise the cash deficit to 2.5 percent. With additional revenues,
including those from the pipeline transit in 2007, and a projected increase in social and
infrastructure expenditure, the fiscal deficit i s expected to remain below 2 percent o f GDP in
the medium term. With the large privatization receipts o f the energy sector, the external
current account deficit in2006 is projectedat around 10percent o f GDP.

29.     Inflation is projected at no more than 10 percent in2006 and as declining thereafter to
an average of 7 percent during 2007-09. The current account deficit is expected to widen in
2006 as a result o fthe external shocks mentioned above. Over the medium term, however, the
expansion o f Georgian exports i s likely to occur at a slower pace than the growth o f its
imports o f machinery and equipment, consumption goods, and energy.            As a result, the
external current account deficit i s projected to remain high at around 8 percent o f GDP over
the medium term, largely financed by inflows o f foreign direct investment, private capital


                                                 14

flows, and donor assistance. The exchange rate i s projected to appreciate slightly while
maintaining the economy's competitiveness.2

30.      The above scenario is based on continued prudent macroeconomic policies and further
progress with structural reforms in the public sector, including the strengthening o f state
institutions, improved governance, the revitalization o f public infrastructure, some stability in
energy supplies, and further enhancement o f the environment for private sector development.
Services are expected to continue their rapid expansion, as the economy develops financial
services, wholesale and retail sectors, and tourism-driven services including hotels and
restaurants.       Developments in industry are expected to be dominated by construction.
Manufacturing may require a longer period for its development. Volatility in the agriculture
sector i s likely to persist, along with the process o f labor-shedding. Sustained high growth
rates are feasible but these in themselves have a limited impact on poverty reduction.
Consequently, rapid sustained growth needs to be complemented by an effective social safety
net. The introduction o f the poverty benefit targetingthe extreme poor is a watershed step in
this direction.

31.      Continued strong fiscal policy i s envisaged for the rest o f 2006. The enhanced legal
and institutional framework for tax and customs administration is expected to further boost
tax and customs revenues over the medium term, inparticular starting in 2007 when planned
reductions inimport tariffs are expected to reduce smuggling, expand the capture o f registered


  The National Bank ofGeorgia will continue its policy ofintervening inthe foreign exchange market only as
needed to smooth sharp fluctuations inlight o fthe large capital inflows.

imports and yield higher collections       Tax revenues are projected to grow to 22 percent of
GDP in 2007 and to increase by an additional 0.5 percent o f GDP each year during 2007-09.
The Government is also progressing towards better fiscal planning through the accelerated
implementation o f a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) with improvedrevenue
forecasts. The new 2007-10 MTEF was presented to the Parliament inMay 2006. According
to Government forecasts, the combination o f additional revenues (including those from the
pipeline transit in 2007) and a projected increase in social and infrastructure expenditure, the
fiscal deficit i s expected to remain below 2 percent o f GDP inthe medium term.

32.     The monetary program projects a continued increase in money demand o f around 15
percent and targets a growth o f reserve money consistent with the objective o f a single-digit
inflation rate. Inflation is expected to decline to an average o f 6 percent by the end o f 2009.
However, inflationary pressures, including those already resulting from higher oil and energy
prices and a higher than expected impact on inflation by monetary aggregates, needto be kept
in check. The adjustment of electricity tariffs towards cost recovery is expected to have a
short term impact on the inflation. There i s also a risk o fhigher Government spendingrelated
to the forthcoming electoral cycles. Indeed, the Government is now facing the challenge o f
prudently managing privatization proceeds, inflows from the Millennium Challenge
Corporation (MCC), and increased fiscal revenues from the pipeline oil transit. With a
prudentmonetary policy, CPI inflation is projected to be no more than 10percent at end-2006
before declining to 6 percent by 2009.

33.     The external current account deficit i s likely to remain high at around 8 percent of
GDP inthe mediumterm. With the completion o fthe Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline in
2005 and the construction o f the South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) for gas by mid-2007, the
imports o f capital goods are expected to decline gradually through 2007 and more rapidly
thereafter. Non-pipeline imports are likely to continue to be dominated by Georgia's energy
needs for some time to come, while other imports are likely to increase as businesses update
their capital investments and imports o f consumer goods grow together with the purchasing
power o f consumers. While the reforms being implemented are expected to expand Georgia's
export capacity, this is likely to develop at a slower rate than the growth inimports. Georgia's
receipts from transit revenues of around 1percent o f GDP from the transport o f oil and gas via
the BTC and SCP pipelines, as well as continued flows o f FDI and other capital inflows,
should help maintain the current account deficit at around 8 percent inthe mediumterm.

34.     Given Georgia's projected external current account deficit and financing mix, the
stock o f external debt i s projected to remain around US$1.7 billion through 2009. Inrelative
terms, however, the debt is expected to decline from 27 percent o f GDP in 2005 to about 23
percent in 2006, and further to an average o f 18 percent during 2007-09. Debt service to
exports, on the other hand, i s projected to increase from 8.7 percent in 2005 to 9.8 percent in
2007 as the rescheduled payment arrears become due, before starting to decline to 4.4 percent
by 2009.     As the strong revenue performance persists and improves the Government's
financial position, the ratio of debt service payments to central government revenues should
fall from about 41 percent in 2004 to about 19 percent in 2008. The underlying debt service
projections assume similar rescheduling agreements to those grantedby the Paris Club for all
non-Paris Club members. To date, the only remaining discussions to be concluded are with
Kazakhstan.


                                                 16

35.     Georgia's external financing requirements for 2006 are estimated at around US$746
million. Of this, about US$500 million is assumed to be financed through FDIand US$120
million (including the IMF) through multilateral and bilateral public support. IDA'Ssupport
in2006 is assumed at US$72 million, US$20 million of which would be from the proposed
second PRSO. External financing needs are projected at US$570 million annually during
2007-09, with FDIcovering an average of US$400 million as the construction o f the pipelines
ends.   The residual financing needs are assumed to be met by borrowings at continued
concessional rates and exceptional financingfrom IDA and the IMF.

36.     The IMF-World Bank Joint Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)            for Georgia shows a
sustained improvement indebt indicators provided macroeconomic stability i s maintainedand
economic reforms are systematically implemented (see Annex 3). The analysis shows that
Georgia is at a low risk o f debt distress. This is due to significant improvements in debt
indicators and overall improvements in creditworthiness. However, Georgia's debt patterns
remain vulnerable to shocks, including a sharp deterioration in the external current account
deficit, the volume and terms o f future capital inflows, and negative export or output growth
shocks. The results of these simulations clearly point to the central importance o f effectively
implementing economic reforms and safeguarding macroeconomic stability so as to ensure
sustained improvementin debt levels and composition.


                        111.    THE GOVERNMENT'SPROGRAM

A.      The Poverty Situation

37.     One o f the key structural factors contributing to the high poverty levels in Georgia i s
the economic restructuring o f the first 13 years o f transition. Following a similar path o f
adjustment to that o f other transition economies, Georgia's population has experienced a
severe decline in welfare since its independence in 1991. The output contraction during
transition in Georgia was one o f the most severe in the region: output fell by an estimated
cumulative amount o f 74.6 percent between 1989 and 1998. In addition, the collapse in
output was accompanied by very highinflation and loss o f savings duringthe period 1989-95.

38.     During the first years of transition the output contraction in Georgia was severe and
contributed to a major reallocation of the labor force across sectors. Agriculture became the
"employer o f first resort" and employment inthe agricultural sector increased from about 25
percent o f total employment in 1992 to 55 percent in 2004. Productivity inagriculture i s low
and has been declining for many years, as workers who lost their jobs elsewhere in the
economy relocated to rural areas and plot sizes became very small and inefficient. Levels o f
poverty inthe rural areas also became more severe because o f frequent floods and droughts, as
well as a very limitedroadnetwork and outages o fwatedenergy supply.

39.     Since taking office in January 2003, the Government has made reducing poverty a key
priority o f its reform program. Among the most important poverty reduction measures in


 The IMF-World Bank Joint Debt SustainabilityAnalysis, completedinSeptember 2006, was preparedby IMF
andWorldBank staffs.

                                                 17

recent years are an increase in social spending by 5 percentage points o f GDP between 2003
and 2005 to one-third o f total public spending, and the elimination o f pension and wage
arrears. While the economic recovery has acceleratedinthe last few years, annual income per
capita i s still some 50 percent below the pre-independence level andthe unemploymentrate i s
about 14percent.

40.      Although the overall povertyrate i s starting to decline, a solid trend inthis direction is
yet to be secured. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper Progress Report (PRSP Progress
Report) prepared recently by the Georgian authorities reports that overall poverty incidence
increased from 35.7 in 2004 to 39.4 percent in 2005 before declining in the first quarter o f
2006 to 33.6 percent.       These figures are consistent with the preliminary findings o f the
Poverty Assessment prepared by the World Bank (forthcoming 2006).                 In general, labor
market status, asset ownership and household composition appear to be the key determinants
o f households' economic and social situations. Poverty estimates indicate that families with
unemployed members, rural families with no land or small lots o f land and with few or no
cattle, families with three or more children, and single parent families with children face a
particularly highpoverty risk. This underlinesthe relevance and timeliness of the introduction
o f the poverty benefit to the extreme poor under this proposed PRSO I1- a major step towards
poverty reduction.

41.      It is too early to assess the actual effects o f recent economic reforms and their impact
on poverty. However, if macroeconomic stability i s maintained and economic reforms are
implemented, the growth path is expected to move towards an improved capacity for net job
creation and hence sustained reductions in poverty. Reforms supported by the proposed
PRSO program aim at providing a solid foundation towards this end.4


B.       The Government's Poverty Reduction Strategy

42.      The Government o f Georgia recently prepared the PRSP Progress Report o f 2006, or
Economic Development Poverty Reduction Program Progress Report (EDPRP Progress
Report) as it i s knowninGeorgia. The Governmenthas updatedits Basic Data andDirections
document for 2007-10, which reaffirms its PRSP objectives, provides the macroeconomic
framework (and resource envelope) for the period, and includes detailed descriptions o f the
individual sectoral strategies for achieving these objectives. The staffs o f the IDA and the
IMF have prepared a Joint Staff Advisory Note on PRSP Progress Report of 2006 Georgia
which i s beingcirculated inparallel this proposed operation.

43.      The strategic framework of the EDPRP has two major objectives: (i) rapid and a
sustainable economic development, with a real GDP growth target o f 5-8 percent a year; and
(ii)reductioninextremepovertyfrom2005levelof13.5percentto5percentby2015,anda
     a
reduction inoverall poverty from 39.4 percent in2005 to 15 percent by 2015.

44.      To meet these two objectives, the Government's reform program identifies six main
areas for action:



 See World Bank Georgia: Country Partnership Strategy 2005.

                                                  18

   e   Strengthening governance

   e   Improving macro-financialperformance

   e   Improving the investment climate and enhancing productivity and employment
       growth, with a sectoral focus on energy, transport and communications, and tourism

   e   Buildinghumancapital

   e   Reducingthe vulnerability o fthe poor

   e   Protecting the environment.

45.    The Government is coordinating with the donor community to ensure the consistency
of policy reforms by consolidating the reform agendas o f the PRSP or EDPRP Progress
Report, the Individual Partnership Action Plan for joining NATO (PAP), the EU
Neighborhood Policy (ENP) and other policy documents.


           IV.     BANKSUPPORTTO THE GOVERNMENT'SSTRATEGY

A.     Objective and Scope

46.    The proposed second Poverty Reduction Support Operation (PRSO 11) is the second in
a series o f three annual programmatic operations, the first of which was presented to the
Board in September 2005. The objective o f the second PRSO i s to continue to support further
implementation o f the Government's PRSP through deepening policy and institutional
reforms in the four key areas developed under PRSO I.These include: (i)strengthening
public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency; (ii)improving electricity and gas
sector services; (iii)improving the environment for private sector development; and (iv)
improving social protection, education and health care services. The content of the PRSO
program and its alignment with the Government's own program remains unchanged.
Satisfactory progress has been achieved with the implementation o f the first PRSO program
andall actiondtriggers for the second PRSO havebeenmet.

       1. Strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency. This
           pillar focuses on continued improvements in the public sector that cut across
           public expenditure management, fiduciary activities, and public administration.
           Specific policy actions under this component aim at: strengthening budgetingand
           expenditure management; increasing transparency and efficiency in the public
           procurement     and    financial management       systems; strengthening    public
           administration and intergovernmental fiscal relations;      and enhancing the
           transparency and accountability o f the public sector. Further improvements in
           governance and public sector management under the second PRSO are
           contributing to reducing the opportunities for corruption.




                                              19

        2. Improving electricity and gas sector services. Measures under this pillar build on
            continued efforts to remedy the severe energy sector situation. Electricity and gas
            sector services have improved significantly under the first and second PRSO.
            Nevertheless, the conditions o f the energy sector remain unfavorable to businesses
            and to job generation. To continue to improve the electricity and gas sectors, the
            Government has updated and i s implementing a medium-term strategy plan which
            outlines the reforms in the electricity and gas sectors. Specifically, reforms are
            aimed at addressing electricity sector debt, improving payment collections,
            strengthening monitoring and reporting o f electricity services, and diversifylng
            supply sources in the gas sector.      The Government has moved forward with
            privatizing sector assets inpower generation and distribution.

        3. Improving the environment for private sector development.                      This pillar
            recognizes that the development o f the private sector i s critical to sustaining high
            growth and creating employment opportunities for the poor.              Policy measures
            under this component focus on reducing the costs to business activity imposed by
            the public sector, including further simplifyingthe tax legislation, streamlining the
            regulatory framework, and modernizing the Customs Code supported by a re-
            organized and re-staffed Customs Office.

        4. Improving social protection, education, and health care services. This pillar
            focuses on deepening the ongoing reforms to further improve the access,
            accountability, and affordability o f services in the social sectors and social
            protection for the vulnerable.       The Government has introduced a fiscally
            sustainable targeted social assistance program aimed at improving the welfare o f
            the extreme poor. The Government's reform program includes improving the
            efficiency and efficacy o f resources in education by: (i)strengthening the
            capitation financing model; (ii)  developing the systematic testing and monitoring
            o f results and strengthening quality-enhancing dimensions including educational
            materials and curricula; (iii)participating in international assessment programs
            such as Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and
            Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS); and (iv) adopting a
            revised basic benefits package aimed at improving equity in access to health
            services.

47.     In each of these areas the Government, in collaboration with the Bank and key
stakeholders, identified the needed policy decisions and the key actions under the PRSO
program. Progress has been satisfactory with all key policy actions o f PRSO I.The second
PRSO has built on the progress made thus far and has further consolidated and strengthened
the ongoing reform program. Capacity buildingneeds have been identified and donor support
i s being provided in a coordinated manner. A Japanese PHRD' grant is expected to provide
additional technical assistance in support o f the implementation o f the PRSO program,
particularly in the areas o f monitoring and evaluation. The specific policy measures to be
supported by the second PRSO are discussed inSection V.




  JapanPolicy and HumanResourcesDevelopmentTrust Fund. The grant request is under the approvalprocess.

                                               20

48.     As described in the Letter o f Development Policy (see Annex 1) the growth and
poverty reduction strategy o f the Government focuses on measures to curb corruption and
improve governance and public service delivery while improving the policy framework for
private sector-led growth. Inthis context, the anti-corruption and governance strategy o f the
PRSO program has two intertwined dimensions.

49.     First, inaddition to measures to improvepublic service delivery inthe sectors covered
in the program, anti-corruption and governance measures are embedded in all the areas of
reform supported by the PRSO program. Second, the program supports the implementation o f
the Government's National Anti-Corruption Strategy adopted under the first PRSO.             In
addition, the Country Partnership Strategy emphasizes the close links between the PRSO and
investment operations serve to strengthen the implementation capacity in the key areas o f the
program. This approach aims at optimizing the results on the ground by complementing
policy reform with the necessary investment to buildcapacity.
B.      Phasingof the Reforms

50.      The program framework laid out, and the measures taken under the first PRSO,
supported strategy/policy formulation and action plans to assist the Government in its initial
stages of reform implementation.      The second PRSO has focused more on deepening the
institutional structure and further implementing o f the strategies and action plans initiated
under the first PRSO. The third PRSO is envisaged as concentratingmore on broader public
sector reforms and private sector development as well as on intensifylng the reforms in the
social sectors. These measures are built around the Government's development strategy and
reform program as elaborated inthe attached Letter o fDevelopment Policy (see Annex 1).

51.      The specific policy actions and outcomes envisaged under the PRSO series are shown
inthe Operations Policy Matrix (see Annex 2). This Matrix, which has beenpreparedjointly
with the Government and in consultation with the key donors, was reviewed and updated
during the appraisal o f the operation. The Matrix includes a set of outcome and monitoring
indicators that will help to gauge reform progress. Table 1above summarizes the core actions
o f the program. As described in section V, all prior actions o f the second PRSO have been
met.


C.       Linkagesto the CountryPartnershipStrategyand Other BankTasks

52.     Link to the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). The PRSO program forms the
backbone o f the CPS lendingprogram (FY06-09) which was discussed by the Board together
with the first PRSO in September 2005. The following three overarching objectives which
constitute the centerpiece o f the CPS represent the priorities identified in the EDPRP and its
Annual Progress Report o f 2006: (i) enabling o f income and employment-generating
                                           the
growth; (ii)human development and social protection; and (iii)the improvement o f the
effectiveness o f the public sector and its delivery o fpublic services.

53.     As discussed inthe CPS, the strategy is highlyselective. The PRSO forms an essential
element by covering the core sectors targeted for Bank Group support inthe CPS. Inturn, the
CPS leverages the reforms supported by the PRSO through investments in essential


                                                 21

infrastructure and service delivery, and technical assistance in public sector reform, and
energy.

54.      Link to AAA (see Table 3). The reforms supported by the PRSO program are based
on extensive Analytic and Advisory Activities (AAA) by the Bank, including a Public
Expenditure Review (PER) in 2003; a Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) in
2002; a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA) in 2003; an Integrated Trade
Development Study (2003); a Pension and Social Assistance Note (2005), a Doing Business in
2006 (2005), and a Financial Sector Assessment Program Update (2006). Preliminary
analytical work for the ongoing Programmatic Poverty Assessment (FY05-07) has provided
additional analytical underpinnings for the PRSO. A Country Economic Memorandum, which
focuses on growth and jobs, is planned for FY07. And a Programmatic Public Expenditure
Review planned for FY08 aims to provide analytic support to the PRSO program and to the
implementationo f the CPS.

55.       Link to Other Bank Operations (see Table 3). The PRSO program supports the
recently approved Public Sector Financial Management Reform Project which aims, inter alia,
to assist the Government in addressing the capacity constraints o f key public sector agencies.
The strengthening o f local governance and intergovernmental fiscal relations is being
supported by the Second Municipal Development and Decentralization Project.                           In the
education sector, reforms support and strengthen the Government's program under the
Education System Realignment and Strengthening Project, emphasizing the need for
accountability in service delivery and providing information to enable the system to monitor
educational outcomes, especially for the poorest. Similarly, the health sector reforms that are
supported in the PRSO program have a direct link with the ongoing Primary Health Care
Development Project. Implementation o f the PRSO program inthe energy sector is also being
supported by the Electricity Market Support Project and its Supplemental Credit. The PRSO
does not cover all areas o f Bank assistance to the Government's reform program (PRSP or
E D P W as it i s known in Georgia). Table 3 shows the link between the proposed PRSO and
other Bank activities.

D.       Collaboration with the IMF and Other Donors

56.      Maintaining macroeconomic stability continues to be a high priority for the
Government.        To that end, the Government has maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic
performance in line with the IMF PRGF as well as the Bank PRSO program. The IMF
completed its third review o f the PRGF program in February 2006. The discussions during
the third review focused on medium-term policies necessary to maintain macroeconomic
stability and growth and to reduce poverty. These policies included measures to further

                                                       23

liberalize the economy and remove the remaining obstacles to businesses, and to develop the
public infrastructure and the financial sector requiredfor private sector activity.

57.     The second PRSO program continues to be closely coordinated with the IMF PRGF.
The division o f labor and the areas o f shared responsibilities are described in Annex 4. The
teams from both institutions work in close collaboration while on missions and meet
periodically to exchange views and review recent developments in Georgia to ensure the
consistency o fthe macroeconomic and structural policy reforms inthe two programs.

58.     The work on the second PRSO is also closely coordinated with the activities o f the
other donors who are actively contributing to the financing o f the Government's program in
Georgia. These donors include: the European Commission (intergovernmental fiscal relations,
external audit, administrative reform); USAID (budget, Treasury management, governance,
anti-corruption,  private sector development, agriculture,       sanitary/food safety, energy,
education);   SIDA (public sector, governance reform, agriculture, natural            resources,
environment, health, education);      UNDP (administrative/civil service reform, poverty
monitoring);   DFID (MTEF, health sector budget management); EBRD (investment
promotion, energy); the Netherlands (Co-financing); GTZ (legal, judiciary, landmanagement,
private sector development); and KfW (energy).

59.     The Bank i s also consulting and coordinating closely with the private sector inGeorgia
(Georgian Business Confederation, Chamber o f Commerce, Association of Georgian
Exporters, and others) and with NGOs (including the Young Economists' Association,
Transparency International, and the Open Society Georgia Foundation) on the PRSO reform
program.


E.      Lessons Learned

60.     The formulation o f the second PRSO program draws on the lessons learned from the
implementation o f the first PRSO, previous development policy operations, and the overall
IDA support to the reform process in Georgia.         Up until the Rose Revolution, Georgia
suffered from a severe deterioration ingovernance which was reflected inthe fragmentation o f
power, the dominance o f interest groups and widespread corruption. As a result, progress
with the earlier reform implementation was sporadic and achievements were often
undermined.

61.     Thus, the more recent policy dialogue between IDA and the Government o f Georgia
has had a strong public sector reform, anti-corruption and governance content which is the
overarching principle encompassing the major policy issues o f the PRSO-supported reform
program.

62.     Thus, the success o f a policy-based operation in Georgia depends basically on three
main factors. First, the Government has a strong ownership o f the reform program and leads
the reforms with the IDA plays a catalytic and supportive role. Second,the operation is well
defined and focused on priority issues where the medium-term strategy i s well understood and
accepted by the Government.        Thirdly, any reform program i s grounded in a realistic
assessment o f the Government's implementation capacity. Careful balance o f these three

                                                24

  factors has resulted in a well-focused and sequenced program, supported by well-coordinated
  donor technical assistance.          Increasing the Government's implementation capacity and
  leveraging World Bank Group resources through other donors are critical elements in the
  design of the IDA'Sfuture assistance program inGeorgia.


           V. THE PROPOSEDPOVERTYREDUCTIONSUPPORTOPERATION

  A.       Pillar 1: StrengtheningPublic Sector Accountability,Efficiency,and
  Transparency

  Key Issues

  63.      Public expenditure management reforms are needed to improve budgetary resource
   allocation and to establish a stronger link to Government objectives. The Government has
  made substantial progress in establishing the basic elements o f public expenditure
   management institutions in Georgia.6 With support from the first PRSO, the Government
   launched a comprehensive reform and started to develop an MTEF. The reform aims at
   addressing inherited problems including: (i) of strategic planning inthe budget process,
                                                        lack
  which constrains the implementation o f key reforms and limits links between expenditures
   and national and sector objectives and policies; (ii)     weaknesses in budget execution resulting
   from weak cash-flow management, which causes spendingoutturns to deviate markedly from
  the budget plan; (iii) tax administration, which contributes to unstable tax policies and
                           weak
   inadequate revenue mobilization; and, (iv) ineffective sector expenditures owing to poor
  budgetaryallocations which has resulted ininadequatesocial spending.

   64.     Enhancing public sector accountability and improving governance will also require a
   transparent   and efficient fiduciary framework            (public  procurement and financial
  management). Inthe area o fpublic procurement the Government has undertaken initial steps
  to enhance transparency and efficiency, following the recommendations o f the Country
  Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) and with the support from the first PRSO. A new
   State Procurement Law (SPL), approved on April 20, 2005, became effective on January 1,
   2006, and created the State Procurement Agency (SPA) and established government-wide
   processes for transparent procurement. In 2005, the Government launched the SPA website
   and has made some progress by providing broader dissemination o f information about
   procurement practices by including forthcoming bidding opportunities, contract award
   announcements, and a registry o fproviders o f goods, works and services.

   65.     Public financial management has been an area o f considerable challenge in Georgia.
   The Chamber o f Control (CoC) had developed a very poor reputation and was closed for a
   prolonged period after the Rose Revolution. It has since re-opened. The re-establishment o f
'  the CoC has been an important step in the move to control fraud and corruption, particularly
   in the absence of an effective internal audit mechanism. Georgia has also faced significant
   problems relating to extrabudgetary revenues and expenditures, which are manifested inweak
  budget execution and in deviations between formulated and executed budgets. Finally, there


   6 This includes a legal framework and procedures for budget management, a basic framework for inter-
  governmental finance relations, and a Treasury system.

                                                        25

i s an issue regarding the fiscal accountability o f Georgia's numerous Legal Entities o f Public
Law (LEPLs): these are quasi-public entities that were created to improve service delivery and
that receive substantial transfer from the state.

66.       Strengthening intergovernmentalfiscal relations constitutes part o f the broader public
expenditure management reform and i s also central to strengthening the accountability for
public resources and public service delivery.                The challenges in intergovernmental fiscal
relations include: (i)     a highlyfragmented administrative structure and weak implementation
capacity; (ii)   an excessive vertical hierarchy o f command with allegiance to the center which
undermines accountability; (iii)         the unclear assignment o f fhctional responsibilities and
resources (particularly between the rayons and the self-government authorities), which i s still
made on the basis o f ad hoc negotiations; (iv) the increasing disparities in spending and
revenue capacities without proper compensatory transfer mechanisms; (v) unstable rights to
public assets and lack o f access to capital markets; and (vi) the lack o f legislation on local
Self-government budgets and on fiscal equalization. As a result, unfunded mandates have
proliferated and there i s no uniformity among the local government budgets. The local
budgets lack predictability and their fiscal reporting systemis faulty. This situation has had a
negative impact on the fiscal autonomy, transparency and accountability o f local governance.'

67.       Strengthening public administration i s necessary for the effective implementation o f
public policies and the improvement o f service delivery. Inno other area does the legacy o f a
failed state weigh as heavily as inthe area o f public administration. InGeorgia the number o f
public employees was very large, salaries were low and wage arrears were common: the skills
o f public employees were low, and there was pervasive corruption.                        The Government is
implementing public administration reform in two stages. The first stage i s driven by the
reform o f the state so rightsizing and redefiningthe role o f the state i s being implemented on a
unit-by-unitbasis. This stage is expected to last two more years. In a second stage, a more
comprehensive public administration reform will be implemented.

68.       The Government has consistently emphasized that public sector accountability and
anti-corruption are the focal points o f its reform agenda and has also conveyed to the public
and the international community its intent to establish efficient and effective governance
systems and processes. Early on, the Government focused its anti-conuption agenda on
making high-profile arrests and prosecutions and promoting ministry-specific administrative
reorganization, downsizing and reform. This approach gives individual ministers discretion
on how to eradicate corruption and reform the administration, thus locating the responsibility
for reform in the ministries. The action orientation o f this approach is highly commended,
with various ministries already developing and implementing focused reforms intended to
curb corruption and enhance service provision. However, the coordination o f these activities
i s poor, progress is not being monitored, and there are concerns about reform sustainability.
To adopt a more systematic approach to curbing corruption, the Government prepared and
adopted an Anti-corruption Strategy under the first PRSO. As discussed in the following


'In  2004, the Government established a State Commission for Effective Governance and Territorial Reform,
which i s chaired by the President. The mandate o f the Commission i s to review the legislative basis required for
the consolidation o f local self-governments, propose a remapping the territorial-administrative structure,
formulate an intergovernmental fiscal relations strategy, and implement an effective local governance system.

                                                        26

section, this more systematic approach i s focusing increasingly on preventive measures and
mitigating the opportunities for corruption.

The Government Reform Program

69.     Well functioning and efficient public institutions are essential to the effective use o f
public resources and the achievement o f poverty reduction objectives. The key medium-term
objective o f the Government's program i s to establish strong, efficient, and accountable public
sector institutions that perform their functions in a transparent way. The EDPRP and the
Annual Progress Report o f 2006 have noted many weaknesses in Georgia's public sector
management and have identified the priority areas for enhancing public sector accountability
and efficiency. The recent Bank work inthe PER, CPAR, and the CFAA have also confirmed
those findings.

70.     To enhance accountability, efficiency, and transparency in the public sector, the
Government's program under the PRSO focuses on the following areas:

    (1-i)       Strengthening public budgetingand expenditure management
    (1-ii) Enhancing transparency andefficiency inthe public procurement system
    (1-iii) Improving the transparency and effectiveness o fpublic financial management
    (1-iv)      Strengthening local governance and intergovernmental fiscal relations
    (1-v)       Strengthening public administration
    (1-vi)      Enhancing public sector transparency and accountability.


71.     (14) Tostrengthenpublic budgeting and expenditure management, the Government
intends to deepen the measures undertaken thus far in the MTEF reform and to improve the
policy orientation o f the budget preparationprocess. The first PRSO supported improvements
in the policy focus o f the annual budget preparation by incorporating planning information
from pilot ministries (originally Education, Health and Agriculture but later expanded to
include two other line ministries) into the pre-budget document, along with budget ceilings.
The link between policy and budget content was further strengthened by requiring users to
match budget requests with three-year policy timefi-ames, by requiring more substantive
justification for budgetary requests, and by continuing to develop a programmatic focus in
their requests.

72.     The second PRSO has expanded and deepened this process by supporting the
expansion o f the MTEF processes to all line ministries except the Ministryo f Interior. During
2005-06, the Government accelerated the integration o f the BDD and MTEF inception
memorandums and exceeded its original plans to extend coverage to a limited number o f units
by completing the coverage o f the majority o f line ministries for the 2007 budgetpreparation.
However, the quality o f the submissions has varied across ministries. Still these measures
provide a solid platform for strengthening efficiency in the use o f public resources and
accountability results.     Steps have also been taken towards developing results and
performance indicators for some programs in different sectors.            In light of this early
achievement, the Government now plans to focus on strengthening the capacity o f spending

                                              27

unit budget departments, and on the enhancing quality o f spending policies-the                     efficiency
and efficacy o f public expenditures within a budget envelope. These ministries are being
assisted by Ministry o f Finance (MoF) personnel to develop better submissions in subsequent
budgets.

73.      Underthe second PRSO,the following actions were implemented:

     0   Satisfactory progress was achieved in (i)improving the policy content o f the annual
         budget preparation and execution including better linking o f the MTEF to the budget
         cycle; (ii)  developing and implementing o f the MTEF-based budgetary process; and
         (iii)increasing the focus on the improved efficiency o fpublic expenditures.

74.      As a result o f these efforts, the 2007 budget process covering a four-year budget cycle
has expanded the share o f budget spending covered by sectoral expenditure strategies
(including sectoral matrices) from under 10 percent to 50 percent, and has provided for a
performance monitoring system. Furthermore, the MTEF process has strengthened the
connection betweennational policy objectives and budget allocations, resulting ina narrowing
o fthe discrepancy betweenactual expenditure and budgeted amounts8

75.      Under PRSO IIIprogress i s expected to continue to firther improve the policy content
o f the budget process and the efficiency o f public expenditures by aligning budgetary
allocations with national expenditure priorities.

76.      (1-ii) To enhance transparency and efficiency in thepublicprocurement system, the
PRSO program supports the implementation o f the recommendations o f the Country
Procurement Assessment Review as agreed with the Government. Duringthe first PRSO, the
SPA prepared an annual procurement report for 2004 and posted on its website information on
procurement        procedures,       advertisements         o f   forthcoming       bidding    opportunities,
announcements regarding contract awards and decisions on administrative reviews pertaining
to procurement-related disputes. An updated registry o f goods, works and services suppliers is
now complete and publicly available. The Government has also amended the Law on State
Procurement to improve its coverage to state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and to streamline
procedures.'

77.      Under the second PRSO the following actions were implemented:


     0   The Government submittedto Parliament further amendments to the Law on State
         Procurement to adopt international practices o f retroactive financing inpublic
         procurement




* Itshould be noted that the complexities o f the tax reforms undertaken in2005 and 2006 complicated revenue
forecasting. The later over-performance o f revenue measures allowed for a number of supplemental budgets
duringthis period that hrther inflatedthe discrepancybetween the original budget and the actual execution.
9 The new draft amendments submitted to the Parliament included provisions on its application to SOEs.
However, the law does not specify that in order to bid on a contract an SOE should be financially and legally
autonomous, should operate on a commercial basis, and shouldbe independent o f the procuring entity.

                                                         28

          The SPA has maintained the publicationo f annual reports on procurement processes,
          activity and performance available on its website, as well as remedial actions proposed
          to address deficiencies inthe procurementprocess
          The list o f confidential procurement items was rationalized and fair andtransparent
          administrative procedures were established for blacklisting companies and individuals
          engaged inprocurement violation.
78.       Accordingly, procurement procedures have been largely simplified in line with
international practices, and key indicators have been developed to monitor procurement
performance. The number o f public contracts awarded on a competitive basis was reported at
600 at the end o f 2005 compared to none the year before, and i s expected to rise to beyond 75
percent o f total contracts during the third PRSO. Additional measures to improve public
procurement are also envisaged under the third PRSO inline with the recommendations o f the
Action Plan o f the updated Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). Procurement
auditingreviews are expected to ensure that broad anti-corruption initiatives remain on track.

79.       (1-iii) To improve transparency and effectiveness in public financial management,
the Government, with the support o f the PRSO program, has developed a three-pronged
strategy. First, the PRSO supports strengthening the role and functionality o f the Chamber of
Control (CoC), building on technical assistance from TACIS, GTZ and DFID, to establish the
CoC as a modem Supreme Audit Institution."                Under the first PRSO, the CoC reopened and
resumed its auditing function, publishingall completed audit results for the first half o f 2005
on its website.

80.       Underthe second PRSOthe following actions were implemented:

          The CoC submitted to Parliament an amended draft Law on the Chamber o f Control
          elevating its mandate and responsibilities to a supreme audit institution in line with
          International Organization o f Supreme Audit Institutions (INTOSAI) standards.
          The CoC produced and adopted a Strategy for Corporate Development and
          Reorganization Implementation Plan in which it outlined its plans for organizational
           and capacity buildingover the next five years.
81.       The CoC has already made progress inimplementingits Strategy including publishing
a Five Year Training Plan for 2006-2011 and has begun to formally reevaluate all staff in
terms o f qualifications and knowledge;" it has also further trained o f its staff and performed a
detailed review o f its legal basis. In addition, for two years in a row the CoC has produced
and submittedto Parliament its annual audit report.

82.       Tentatively, the draft Law on the mandate and responsibilities o f the CoC as a supreme
audit institution i s to be enacted under the third PRSO, and subsequently the CoC i s to
develop a comprehensive external audit methodology and quality assurance system. The third
PRSO also aims at supporting the continued implementation o fthe CoC reorganization plan.


loThe   DFID is also providing technical assistance to support TACIS and GTZ recommendations that would be
acceptable to the Government and the donor community and that would attract donor support for the necessary
activities.
I 1This has resultedinthe dismissal o f some 30-40 staff.

                                                        29

83.     Second, the PRSO agenda will support the Government's intent to further reform
Treasury operations and introduce robust accounting standards.12 Under the first PRSO, the
Treasury started producing monthly central government cash and commitment reports as
requiredby the Budget Systems Law and it closed all zero-balance revenue transit accounts at
the National Bank of Georgia.

84.     Under the second PRSO,the Government was responsible for the following reforms:


     0   Implementeda Treasury Single Account (TSA) for central government;

     0   Adopted consistent rules and guidelines for all Treasury operations both at the central
         level and at decentralized levels

         Produced consolidated cash and commitment reports for the central government,
         Tbilisi and four other large cities

     0   Adopted and initiated an Accounting Reform Strategy for producing annual
         consolidated financial statements in accordance with internationally accepted
         accounting and reporting standards.
85.      The reforms to date have led to considerable progress in strengthening the Treasury
system and its financial reporting framework. Tentatively, the third PRSO reforms include:
making progress in further implementing further its Accounting Reform Strategy by setting
out a detailed action plan, developing a GFS2001-compliant budget classification, and
implementing a cash-based Treasury General Ledger incorporating the new budget
classification; and producing consolidated cash and commitment reports for the central level
andthe decentralized levels o fgovernment.

86.      Third, the reforms aim at improving the financial accountability mechanisms in all
public and quasi-public entities during the PRSO program. To this end, under the second
PRSO,the Government initiatedthe followingmeasures:

     0   Prepared revisions to the legislation regarding the judicial status o f public and quasi-
         public entities inorder to define the criteria for differentiating between public entities,
         SOEs, and LEPLs. Amendments to the Civil Code o f Georgia on removing certain
         restrictions to broaden the definition o f non-profit entities were approved by the
         Cabinet and are submittedto Parliament.

     0   Developeda register and database o f LEPLsto confirm their authenticity.


87.      These measures represent a first step towards expanding fiscal discipline and
transparency to LEPLs. Tentatively, the third PRSO envisions further steps in this direction



'*Priorto the PRSO program, the Government had made considerableprogress instrengthening the Treasury's
systems. Commitment control was significantly improved in2004 and fully applied to ministries and other central
government agencies. InJanuary 2005, the system was expanded to cover current state special funds: the United
Social Security funds and the Road Fund.Finally, the MoF introduced a filly operative Treasury single account
(TSA).

                                                     30

including defining financial and performance reporting requirements that incorporate LEPLs
into the overall public financial management framework.

88.     (1-iv) To strengthen local governance and intergovernmental fiscal relations, the
Government program calls for the continuation o f the reform measures already initiated. The
Government, under PRSO I,established a State Commission for Effective Governance and
Territorial Reform to review the legislative basis required for the consolidation o f local self-
governance aimed at designing a Strategy for Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations. The State
Commission completed a wide range o f background work to support the design o f its
Strategy. The Government believes that this initial step is essential to start the process o f
improving public service delivery inGeorgia.

89.     Underthe second PRSO,the following actions were implemented:

     e  The draft Law on the Local Self-Government Budget, which provides for
        implementing a new transparent system o f intergovernmental fiscal relations, was
        submitted to Parliament for approval.

     e  An actionplanfor IntergovernmentalFiscalRelations was completedbythe State
        Commission, and an implementation agenda adopted.

     e  The Government adopted a transparent intergovernmental fiscal relation system inthe
        2007 budgetpreparationprocess, and took the first steps to implement transfer
        mechanisms based on the new legal provisions and formula.
90.     The Law establishes rules on control, audit, evaluation and execution governing
intergovernmental fiscal relations and the supporting budgetary process to determine the
budgets o f local self-government units including formula-based transfer mechanisms.

91.     Tentatively, the third PRSO envisions supporting reforms to implement the
Government's Strategy for Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations; satisfactory progress has been
achieved in formulating the budgets o f Tbilisi and other major cities according to the new
legislation. Concurrently, the third PRSO aims at supporting the efforts o f the MoF aimed at
initiating the development o f an integrated system for monitoring municipal budgeting and
financial reporting systems.

92.     (1-v) To strengthen public administration, the Government's program under the
PRSO includes a first stage o f rightsizing and redefining the role o f public entities, through a
unit-by-unit approach to the reform o f the state, and aims at developing a comprehensive
public administration reform strategy to be implemented in a second stage. A report was
prepared under the first PRSO, on public administration and civil service changes in various
ministries which provided input to the strategic thinking o f the Government on the possible
options for the institutional restructuring o f the public administration. The PRSO program
also supports establishing a Human Resources Management Information System (HRMIS),
which will provide the Government with better knowledge o f humanresources staffing and o f
the match between human resources and strategic objectives. This requirement is particularly
important inGeorgia, where there are many questions about staff capacity and efficiency.

93.     Underthe second PRSO,the following actions were taken:

                                               31

       A strategic vision for administrative and civil service reform was formulated and the
       related consultativeprocess is under way

    0  The development o f a HumanResources Management Information System (HRMIS) is
                                                                                                I

       underway.
94.    The reform measures thus far have resulted in streamlining government structures and
functions in several ministries (Education, Justice, Agriculture) and public organizations (tax
and customs administrations, traffic police). This has resulted in reducing civil service
employment by 40,000, improving efficiency, and allowing an increase in salaries for the
remaining staff. These areas were chosen for their strategic value in curbing corruption,
improving public service delivery, and improvingthe business environment.

95.    The third PRSO aims at supporting several reforms, including adopting a medium
term implementation plan for administrative and civil service reform and supporting the
development o f the HRMIS with the aim o f making it operationalby 2009.

96.    (1-vi) To enhance public sector transparency and accountability and to consolidate
the anti-corruption efforts being undertaken in individual ministries, the Government has
created a central entity responsible for coordinating and monitoring government-wide anti-
corruption activities. During the first PRSO, the Government: (i)    adopted the National Anti-
corruption Strategy, including a plan for monitoring the results o f anti-corruption efforts
through broad-based public official and user surveys; (ii)    initiated the development o f the
instruments for a baseline survey for point o f service corruption beginning with the education
sector; and (iii) reorganized and re-staffed the traffic police function (traditionally a very
corrupt function).    Annual Action Plans for the implementation o f the National Anti-
Corruption Strategy have been adopted for 2005 and 2006, with the latter currently being
implemented.

97.    Among the activities being undertaken under the Action Plan, the Government has
launched an exercise to define and circumscribe the functions and scope o f key regulatory and
oversight bodies across the government, and has prepared a comprehensive strategy to
strengthen the rule o f law encompassing the judiciary, law enforcement, and the procuracy
ombudsman, among other organizations.

98.    Underthe second PRSOthe authoritieshaveundertaken the following:

    0  Adopted and initiated the execution o f the Action Plan to implement the          Anti-
       corruption Strategy

    0  Carried out the baseline survey to assess point o f service corruption in the education
       sector

       Started implementation o f the strategy for decreasing corruption in the education
       sector.
99.    During the last year, the institutional arrangements for the implementation o f the
Action Plans were revisited and the former Anti-Conuption Policy Department (ACPD) was
reorganized (in the light o f the restructuring o f the National Security Council to which the

                                               32

ACPD was subordinated) with its coordination and monitoring role subsequently delegated to
the Office o f the State Minister on Reform Coordination (OSMRC). The key staff o f the
ACPD was also absorbed by the OSMRC, thus providing for the institutional continuity o f
this task.

100.    The above reorganization caused some delays in the development o f the reform
monitoring instruments and the conducting o f broad-based public officials' and users'
surveys, given the broad scope o f the PRSO program. The draft instrument has now been
prepared, tested, and discussed among the stakeholders within the Government as well as with
the broader representatives from the civil society. However, as there are currently several
public surveys undertaken in Georgia, it might be reasonable to build on the existing surveys
andimplement any new surveys only as necessary.

101.    InMay 2006, the Ministryo fEducationand Science incollaborationwith the OSMRC
conducted a user baseline survey o f parents and students to assess point o f service corruption
in the education sector, where there have been some concerns regarding informal payments
and the use of funds officially collected from students and parents.           The survey was
accompanied by the postingo f official public information on school bulletinboards regarding
services and fees.

102.    Under PRSO 111, the survey results for education are expected to be published in a
report showing the extent o f point o f service corruption in education and defining remedial
actions. Moreover, baseline surveys for point o f service corruption are to be extended to
health, licensing, and customs as well. The Government will continue the implementation o f
its Anti-Corruption Action Plan during2007.


B.      Pillar 2: Improving Electricity and Gas Sector Services

Key Issues

103.    Until recently, Georgian consumers did not receive electricity and natural gas at
acceptable service levels. Owing to non-payment, low tariffs, energy theft, and possibly
remaining corruption in the energy sector, the financial flows from consumers to the sector
were inadequate to support a 24-hour supply outside o f Tbilisi. Many years o f neglect o f
maintenance and lack o f investments had caused the infrastructure to crumble, resulting in
excessive interruptions inservice.

104.    Over the last few years investments financed by donors as well as the state budget
have helped to improve the technical operation and reliability o f the power system. Over the
next five to seven years, investments on the order o f more than US$lOO million would be
needed for the state-controlled power utilities (transmission and some generation), and several
times that amount in private sector power distribution and generation, in order to achieve
technically reliable supplies. New hydropower capacity (state-owned or private) may cost
more than US$SOO million if that route i s followed to substitute for electricity imports. Inthe
gas sector, the investment requirements are also massive, with a short-term need for about
US$40-SO million for the most essential first-phase repair o f the gas transmission system
(U.S. grant financing obtained as described further below).

                                               33

105.    Under the first PRSO the Government developed a Strategic Action Plan in 2005 for
the energy sector with objectives that the Government effectively has pursued. The most
striking improvement in the sector over the last year i s that paying customers now largely
receive 24 hours o f electricity service not only in the capital but in all the regions o f the
country.

106.     This enhanced service level has been essential to the utilities' efforts to increase
collections, in which, notably the Unified Electricity Distribution Company (UEDC) l3has
shown significant improvement. UEDC surpassed 70 percent collections in December 2005,
and regained that level inApril 2006 following a temporary setback duringand after an energy
crisis in Georgia in January 2006 caused by interruption o f energy supplies to Georgia.
Despite the improved financial flows, payments for imported electricity have drained the
sector's finances, and the remaining funds to pay for domestic generation and transmission
services were still a fraction o f the billings during the first half o f 2006. The transmission
company GSE came out o f bankruptcy protection in January 2006 with a court-approved
financial rehabilitation plan, while UEDC and other companies are still under protection from
bankruptcy pending their own rehabilitation plans. PRSO Ialso supported a substantial
transfer o f medium and low voltage assets from the transmission company to the distribution
company UEDC. This has helpedto improve sector operations.

107.     On January 1, 2006, natural gas tariffs were raised by about 30 percent to 34-36 tetri
per cubic meter14 to take into account a large increase in the import price for Russian gas.
Temporary subsidies were provided to vulnerable groups o f the population. On June 1,2006,
electricity tariffs were increased by about 20 percent inTbilisi and more than 60 percent inthe
regions to 15 and 14 tetri per kilowatt hour, respe~tively.'~The tariff increase was designedto
substantially improve the financial situation in the sector, to allow electricity imports to
continue without Government subsidies, and to cover the increased cost o f natural gas fuel for
domestic thermal power stations. Arrangements to protect vulnerable consumer groups were
put inplace.

The Government Reform Program

108.    (2.0 To address the challenges in the energy sector, the Government has a Strategic
Action Plan developed under PRSO Iin2005 which has identified two main aspects o f energy
policy as priorities for the future development o f the sector: self-sustainability and energy
security. The Government i s working to diversify energy imports with respect to source and
type (increasing the gas component), while seeking to efficiently utilize domestic energy
resources (among other actions, pursuing hydropower developments). The Government
recognizes that the improved execution o f operations by sector entities has improved the cash
flow to the sector, and that this investment financing to reduce the risk o f systemic collapse
and enhance the regularity in energy supplies are key to strengthening energy sector

companyoutside of Tbilisi.

performance. International contractors currently manage the Georgian power transmission
system (GSE) and the regional power distribution company (UEDC). The Government has
supportedthe energy sector with substantial funds over the 2005 and 2006 state budgets, and
has successfully attracted donor funds, with the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation
(MCC) being the latest new contributor.

109.    In accordance with the Strategic Action Plan, the Government has embarked on the
privatization o f all power and gas sector assets except the high voltage power transmission
and dispatch, the Enguri hydropower plant, and the main gas transmission pipeline. The gas
distributioncompany Tbilgazi, six hydropower plants and three power distribution companies
(UEDC, Adjara, Kakheti) are already sold. The Government plans to sign sales contracts for
these energy assets in the fall o f 2006. The Government considers the large tariff increase in
June 2006 both a precondition for privatization and a major step towards a financially sound
energy sector.

110.    Underthe second PRSO,the Government has carried out the following:


    0   Achieved satisfactory implementation o f the Energy Sector Medium Term Strategic
        Action Plan.

111. The third PRSO envisions reforms aimed at achieving a satisfactory implementation o f
the UpdatedEnergySector Medium Term Strategic Action Plan.

112.    (2.ii) To deal with the electricity sector debt, the Governmentunder PRSO Iadopted
debt legislation and has drafted a debt management legislation which calls for a commission
to be established to ensure that legacy debt for insolvent state power utilities i s reduced to
levels that the sector entities can service through agreed realistic rehabilitation plans. Power
sector debt as o f the end of 2004 stood at GEL 1.3 billion, o f which most was intra-state debt
including tax arrears and about GEL 320 million was debt to the private sector.

113.    Under the second PRSO,the Government undertook the following:

        Submitted the draft Debt Management Law for the electricity sector to Parliament for
        approval.

114.    While progress in debt managementhestructuring has been slower than expected, the
passage and implementation o f a Debt Management Law under PRSO I11will constitute major
progress provided that the Government, as planned, quickly follows up with establishing a
Debt Management Commission and puts a supporting Group of Experts into operation. In
addition, as a basis for future investments and maintenance programs o f power utilities and to
provide consumers with information, GNERC adopted and implemented procedures to
monitor the power service level to consumers. GNERC published quarterly the monthly
service level data on the internet, geographically broken down by regions or more
disaggregated areas. Inaddition, future service level targets were established.

115.    (2.iii) To deal with payment collections, the Government has provided financial
support to the power distributor UEDC to install communal meters which measure the

                                                35

electricity consumption o f up to 70 families in apartment buildings or villages rather than
utilizing individual meters. About 75 percent o f UEDC's residential consumers are connected
to these communal meters. While inmost cases this i s a temporary solution - with individual
meters being the final solution - it has proved effective for collections and has contributed to
making a higher service level affordable.

116.    Under the second PRSOthe followingimprovementwas achieved:


     0  The power distribution company, UEDC, achieved at least a 65 percent collection rate.

117.    UEDC collections reached an average o f more than 70 percent in the period April
through June 2006. This compares with 50 percent reached at mid-2005 and about 30 percent
at mid-2004. In spite o f this improvement, the still inadequate collection level represents a
major challenge, not the least inthe context o fprivatization. An important issue inthis regard
relates to enforcing payment from water companies, which in future would add about 8
percentage points to the collections rate.

118.    (2.iv) To help ensure cost-recovering targfs, a review o f the tariff methodology o f
GNERC has been undertaken.            It has concluded that the current methodology is sound,
although there i s scope for some improvements.         The Government is committed to the
principle o f covering all sector costs through tariffs while having introduced pricing
mechanisms (block tariffs) that will help shield vulnerable segments o f the population from
the full impact o f large tariff increases.

119.    Under the second PRSOthe followingwas achieved:


     0  The tariff study for electricity and gas was completed, with appropriate proposals for
        amendments to the legislation and the tariff methodology.

120.    (2.v) To better benefit from the potential in the gas sector, the Government
recognizes the need to improve the physical reliability o f supplies and to diversify the
supplies. The importance o f gas supply security became evident in January 2006 when
interruption o f gas supply to Georgia caused severe energy shortages and hardship.         To
improve the physical infrastructure, Georgia has signed a grant agreement with the M C C
which provides US$49 million to help rehabilitate parts o f the Georgian gas transmission
system. The recent rehabilitation o f the old transmission system connecting Georgia with
Azerbaijan allowed Georgia to receive gas contracted from Azerbaijan and Iran during the
January 2006 energycrisis.

121. Underthe second PRSOthe following has also taken place:

        An organization model was adopted for gas supply that ensures that Georgia fully
        benefits from available international competition.

122.    Three state oil and gas companies, the Georgian Gas International Company, the
Georgian International Oil Company, and the National Oil Company (Saknavtobi) have been
placed under a new holding company-Georgian          Oil and Gas Company (G0GC)-and        will

                                                36

soon be fully merged into the new company. A subsidiary gas transportation company will
ensure that relatively inexpensive Azerbaijan gas from the Shah Deniz field, which will start
to flow inthe new South Caucasus Pipeline through Georgia the fall o f 2006, will be utilized
to the fullest extent possible. The gas transportation company will also manage gas transit fee
to Armenian markets, some contracts for more Azerbaijan gas, and a portion o f possible
future domestic gas obtained through production sharing agreements. For other gas imports
and potential additional gas from other sources, the utility companies and large industrial gas
consumers will undertake the importation. The Government and GOGC are looking into the
possible establishment o f underground gas storage in Georgia while pursuing expandedrights
to receive gas from Azerbaijan.

123.    The implementation of energy sector reforms supported by the PRSO program has
contributed to the following outcomes:

        A household survey in mid-2005 showed increased satisfaction with electricity
        services. UEDC reports that paying customers outside Tbilisi during the 2005-06
        winter received 24 hours o f electricity service per day, as compared to former times
        when financial constraints and technical problems in the sector caused massive
        outages. The improved service may have had an impact on collection rates which
        increased to an average o f 65 percent in the first half o f 2006 compared to below 40
        percent in2003.

        The main companies in the sector are operationally viable owing to temporary
        protection from creditors through the bankruptcy law. A new Debt Management Law,
        to be passed, is intended to provide a final solution for legacy debt, while tariff
        increases (June 2006), operational improvements, and privatizations are intended to
        secure financial viability going forward. Major improvementsincollections inUEDC
        in2005 and 2006 indicate that the reforms are movinginthe right direction(although
        full financial viability is not yet demonstrated).

        The ability to manage gas supplies was improved by the Government's decision to
        place the responsibility for the management o f gas transit fees through the new SCP
        pipeline in one company, following a merger of three state oil and gas companies.
        With the coordinated use o fthese mainsupply sources, andwith gas utilities' andlarge
        industrialplants' access to direct contracting, the optimum use o f gas sources could be
        achievable. Additional experience will be gained following the introduction o f gas
        from the SCP pipeline infourth quarter o f 2006.
124.    The third PRSO envisions reforms aimed at further improving the financial viability in
the electricity and gas sectors as the Debt Management Law is enacted and goes under
implementation. The third PRSO also supports reforms aimed at developing mechanisms to
monitor, analyze, and report power supplyplanning, quality, and service delivery to gauge the
impact o f reform on improving services.

C.       Pillar 3: Improvingthe Environment for Private Sector Development

Key Issues

 125.    The development and promotion o f the private sector is a key element in fostering
growth and employment and inreducing poverty. The Government i s aware o f the high costs
o f doing business, and has expressed its commitment to improving the business environment
through reducing the costs for establishing and operating businesses, improving private sector
participation in policymaking, and facilitating transport and trade. Until recently, problems
with public administration and governance severely affected the implementation o f
administrative procedures and the subsequent delivery o f services to businesses.                        These
problems included pervasive petty corruption, the low levels o f professionalism and skills o f
some civil servants, inappropriate working environments and low salaries, almost no
significant operational links between central and regional offices and few realistic
opportunities to enforce rules.

                                      Box 2. Tax Reform in Georgia
         The Government o f Georgia undertook a major tax reform in 2004-05. The tax system was
greatly simplified and made less burdensome with a substantial reduction in the number o f taxes and
the reduction o f several key tax rates (see table). The number o f tax rates was cut from 21 to 7.
Personal income tax rates, which ranged from 12 to 20 percent, were replaced by a flat rate o f 12
percent. The value-added tax (VAT) was reduced from 20 to 18 percent. Payroll taxes, which can
significantly influence employment growth, decreased from 33 to 20 percent. At the same time the
system was made fairer and simpler to manage with the elimination of certain exemptions and special
regimes pertainingto VAT and profit taxes.
                              Table B1: Reforms IntroducedinJanuary2005
                                                 Before                         Reform

                                                               rates were increased.
             Tax base                                          VAT and profit tax elimination of
                                                               certain exemptions and special regimes.
             gurce: Ministry of Finance.

         These reforms were accompanied by tax and customs administration reforms and strengthening o f
enforcement (i.e., tax police).       Owing mainly to improved tax compliance resulting from stricter
enforcement, and the increasing registration o f economic activity, the net impact o f the changes in the tax
law and administrative measureswas strongly positive for collections, with a 5.2 percentage points of GDP
increaseintotal tax revenue collection over the last 18 months.

126.    Moreover, untilrecently significant problems remained with registration, licensing and
permits associated with establishing and operating a business owing mainly to the
arbitrariness in procedures and/or the lack o f an enforcement mechanism. The development
o f businesses in the regions was further hampered simply because business licenses were
issued only inTbilisi. Tax and customs administration as well as inspections procedures were
often subject to ambiguity and different interpretations o f rules and regulations, which


                                                     38

resulted in a non-transparent and unfair implementation o f tax and customs inspection and
increased the opportunities for corruption and rent seeking.

127.    Underthe first PRSO, the Government enacted a new tax code, ineffect since January
2005 (see Box 2), and enacted a law on licensing andpermits, together with major reforms on
de-regulation, tax administration and customs, and this has created a much easier business
environment for the private sector. The number o f tax rate was decreased from 21 to 7 and
tax rates were reduced. The new licensing law reduced the number o f licensed activities from
900 to 150 and created a one-stop shop for license applications so that businesses can submit
all documents in one place. In June 2005, the regulatory framework for product certification
and standardization was completely revamped.

128.    Business processes have been simplified in several critical areas o f government
including in tax administration, and customs, and the regulatory environment was simplified,
thereby reducing the problems with public administration and governance which in the past
severely affected the implementation o f administrative procedures and the subsequent delivery
o f services to businesses. Decisive anti-conuption measures on the part o f the Government
and simplified business processes have sharply reduced opportunities for bribe-seeking,
especially at the service delivery point in the areas o f education, tax administration, customs,
and licensing. As indicated by 2005 BEEPS data for Georgia, unofficial payments inamounts
and in frequency had declined significantly to levels below the average for the CIS and the
ECA region. The Doing Business in 2007 study ranked Georgia globally as the number one
reformer in ease o f doing business in 2006, with an impressive achievement o f improving
from 112`h to 37`h place out of a sample of 175 countries.            Georgia showed significant
improvement in 6 o f the 10 areas of doing business covered by the study. Georgia was also
assigned a "B" rating by the Heritage Foundation, underscoring its success with the reform
program.

129.    However, there remain impediments associated with the implementation and
administration o f the improved legislations: uncertainty about regulatory policies; the
independence, quality and accountability o f the judiciary and law enforcement; and the
protection o f the integrity of private property (property rights), state regulation, inspection and
standardization. The Government recognizes these remaining problems and i s committed to
carrying out additional institutional and legislative reforms to ensure more rapid progress with
its private sector development agenda.

The Government Reform Program

130.    To improve the investment climate and reduce the constraints on private sector
development, the PRSOprogram supports the Government's reform program inthe following
areas: (i)simplifying tax legislation and reducing the tax burdenon individual businesses; (ii)
improving the inspection process, and the permits and licensing requirements; (iii)      facilitating
customs border processing; and (iv) improving standardization. The objectives are to further
reduce the cost o f establishing and operating businesses, to cut down bureaucratic and non-
transparent requirements, to create an effective system o f regulation, to raise product and
safety standards, and to remove technical barriers to trade and improve competitiveness. The
Government is aware o f the importance of an effective implementation mechanism, a

                                                 39

monitoring system, and an ongoing dialogue with all stakeholders including the private sector
inorder to achieve the desired results. Inthis context, the authorities will utilize the support
o f FIAS, IFC PEP, EBRD, EU TACIS, and USAID for this endeavor. The following key
actions under the second PRSO built on progress with the actions taken under PRSO Ito
broaden and intensify the reform agenda towards achieving the medium term outcomes
envisaged inthe PRSO program.

131.     (34 To simplifi tax legislation and reduce the tax burden on entrepreneurs and
individuals.    Supported by the PRSO I,the new tax regime (see Box 2) which became
effective in January 2005, simplified the Tax Code and substantially reduced the tax burden
on firms and individuals by reducing the number o f taxes; abolishing exemptions and
broadening the base; lowering some rates to facilitate compliance; and distributing the tax
burden more equitably.        Furthermore, the Government's strong commitment to fight
corruption in tax and customs administration under the first PRSO resulted in significant
restructuring in the tax and customs administration, improvements in revenue administration
and the ensuring o f proper implementation o f the new legislation. The qualitative
improvement that has taken place intax policy has not only increased budgetrevenues but has
also given the Government the opportunity to deal with the priority issues much more
effectively. It has also led to an increase inthe share o f the formal economy.

132.     Supported by the second PRSO, the authorities have started to define mechanisms and
parameters for assessing the implementation o f the new tax legislation and have begun to
introduce amendments to create a more effective tax administration system for example:

         The Government has reviewed the implementation o f new tax legislation and
         introduced amendments to improve performance.

133.     Inthis regard, several amendments to the tax code were approvedbythe Parliament on
April 28, 2006, which further simplify the registration procedures for taxpayers, decrease the
excise tax on tobacco, and initiate a number o f proposals aimed at boosting tourism and
supporting the energy system in the country. As a result, tax revenues increased from 18
percent o f GDP in2004 to nearly 20 percent in2005, and further to 24 percent inthe first half
o f 2006

134.     The third PRSO envisions continuing to review the performance o fnew tax legislation
and taking the necessary steps to further improve the tax environment for the private sector.

135.     ( 3 4 To enhance the inspection process and streamline cumbersomepermits and
licensing requirements, a major reform was implemented under PRSO Ito simplify the
regulatory environment for inspections, permits and licensing.          The law on permits and
licensing procedures, which was approvedby the Parliament on June 24,2005, cut the number
o f licenses from about 900 to 150, and simplifiedand sharply reduced the process o f obtaining
licenses for businesses by creating a "one-stop shop" and adopting the principle o f "silence is
consent." In addition, several amendments to the Law on Entrepreneurship were adopted in
June 2005 which simplify the registration process for a new business and also move it out o f
the courts and place it inthe Tax Department.



                                                40

136.      Under the second PRSO,the following reforms were completed:

     0    Legislation for simplifying the system o f permits and licensing was adopted and i s
          under implementation.
          Inspection procedures and requirements were publishedfor each agency, including the
          rights and obligations o f inspectors andbusinesses.

137.      The Government has enacted supportinglegislation to further streamline the system o f
permits and licensing. As the system is new, there are some delays inthe implementation o f
the legislation owing to weak administrative capacities and lack o f coordination across
various agencies. Technical assistance from the IFC and the EC i s being provided to the
GeorgianGovernment inthis area.
                                    Box 3. Customs Reformin Georgia
When the customs system started its post-independence operation in 1992, it lacked both basic border
infrastructure and experience inthe customs sphere. Several factors had led to the unsystematic and chaotic
development o f the customs system: (i)       problems with the State Border demarcation; (ii)    problems with
territorial integrity and territories out of the jurisdiction; (iii) o f experience in the customs sphere; (iv)
                                                                    lack
high corruption and weak management; (v) poorly motivated and unqualified staff; (vi) gaps in customs
legislation: and (vi) lack o f technical equipment and infrastructure.

To address these problems and to ensure the development of customs administration, the Customs System
Development Strategy was approved on 10 M a y 2004 to set key directions and strategic priorities o f the
government's customs reform for a period o f three years. High-level political support has been key to the
successful implementation o f the reform which to date include:

*Steps have been taken towards controlling borders and eliminating smuggling from the uncontrolled territories
o f Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Kazbegi. New regulations and the updated structure o f the Customs Department,
inplace since August 2004, have reduced Regional Customs services to only the East and West regions, each
delegated with all functions relatedto the Customs Control and Procedures.

*The Central Apparatus o f the Customs Department which acts only as a supervisory body has undergone
changes to improve management and enhance efficiency. The merger o f administrative units, abolishment o f
rudimentary functions, and introduction o f new substantive functions has resulted ina reduction o f the number o f
administrative units from 10 to 7.

*The Introduction o f the quarterly assessment of staff performance led to the firing of 80 percent o f customs
staff, many of whom were associated with corrupt practices. A new system o f hiring through the introduction of
job descriptions, the classification o f necessary and supplementary qualifications, a higher salary and
performance-based bonus system, and six-month internship practices, are elements o f capacity enhancement
initiative inthe Customs Department.

*New customs procedures are introduced through a one window principle which has simplified customs
clearances; weight infringement control was delegated to the customs services; border phyto-sanitary and
veterinary control were conducted by customs, customs clearance procedures for car import were simplified;
unifieddocumentation for sea port services was introduced. All customs charges were abolished and all customs
duties and fees are currently payable through the banks.

*All customs offices are being connected through the IT network allowing better monitoring o f the process, and
better collection o f the information for reporting and statistical purposes. The information management system
used incustoms is based on ASYCUDA++ whch automates the clearance operations for all customs procedures,
covers the customs accounting for clearance operations, and includes the cash management ("cashier" function).



                                                          41

*Improved customs administration has also resulted in large gains to the budget. Customs revenues in 2005
exceededthose of 2004 by 154 percent. The increasingtrend of revenue mobilization has beenmaintained inthe
first half of 2006. During the first 4 months of 2006 the Customs Department mobilizedrevenuesreflecting a 137
percent increase comparedto the same period in2005.

A new Customs Code has been adoptedby the Parliament inmid-2006. The CustomsDepartmentis undertaking
other complementary reforms including taking first steps for adopting a risk based management system;
monitoring of the effectiveness of customs performance; introducing a modem IT technology; developing a more
sophisticated remuneration system for staff; adopting career development programs; and developing continuous
training programs.

138.      As a result o f these reforms, the number o f businesses requiring inspection has been
substantially reduced and is limited to those with health and safety concerns.                      For the
remaining, businesses inspection procedures and requirements from each agency are
stipulated. A court warrant is now required to undertake an inspection. The new regulations
adopted inApril 2006 have reduced business registration time.

139.       The third PRSO aims to support the Government's efforts in strengthening the
institutional capacity to implement the standardized business permit procedures through
capacity building, stafftraining, monitoring o fperformance standards, and other options.

140.       (3-iii) To facilitate customs and border processing, the authorities have been
addressing the mechanisms for valuing goods, the monopoly o f customs brokerage services,
and the recognition o f OECD/EU certification all o f which had created problems for importers
inthe past. Under the PRSOIand with the assistance ofEUTACIS, the Government drafted
a new Customs Code which was submitted to Parliament in October 2005 following its review
by the EU and consultations with the private sector and civil society. The newly adopted
Customs Code will take effect on January 1, 2007 and simplifies customs requirements
significantly. The new Law on Customs Tariffs approved in July 2006 and effective on
September 1, 2006 abolishes import tariff on almost 90 percent o f items by reducing the
numbero ftariffs rates from 16 to only 3 (0, 5, and 12percent).

141.      Underthe second PRSO,the authorities have institutedthe following:


      0   A customs policy and institutional reform aimed at eliminating widespread sources o f
          corruption including: (i)adopting a new customs code; and (ii)              reorganizing and re-
           staffing the Customs Office (see Box 3).

142.      As a result o f these reforms, Georgia has an open and competitive trade regime. The
reform o f the Customs Office has been comprehensive including re-organizing and re-staffing
that has substantially reduced the scope for corruption (see Box 3). Progress in implementing
the Action Plan to improve procedures has substantially reduced customs and border
processing time for business.

143.      The third PRSO envisions supporting reforms aimed at improving the institutional
capacity for the implementation o f customs regulations through improved customs procedures
based on processing time measurement; and through the coordination o f the control o f freight
at the border. The first steps are expected in developing and reporting standard performance
indicators to gauge the performance and monitor the progress o f the reforms.

                                                        42

144.    (3-iv) To improve standardization, to facilitate access to non-CIS markets, especially
for food and agro-processed products, and to help raise the competitiveness o f Georgian
projects, Georgia i s harmonizing its regulations with those o f the EUand the WTO and during
the PRSO period is introducing an internationally recognized system of accreditation, quality
management and assurance, as well as standardization and technical regulations.                            Until
recently, businesses complained that: (i) number o f goods that were subject to mandatory
                                                    the
certification was too large; (ii)        Georgia continued to use old Soviet GOST standards and
certificates, which are considered obsolete by many companies; and (iii)information was
lacking in relation to the standardization and certification process.'6 Under the first PRSO,
the authorities with the assistance of EU TACIS and USAID drafted the following legislation
which was approved by the Parliament in June 2005: (i)the Law on Certification, which
includes Accreditation and the General Safety of Goods; (ii)                the Law on Standardization; and
(iii) LawonMetrology."
     the

 145.   Under the second PRSO, the Government enacted these laws, developed the required
necessary secondary regulations and created an appropriate legislative basis for accreditation
and conformity assessment and a formal framework o f rules for technical standards
committees. These reforms resulted inthe following:


    0   The establishment o f two separate agencies: (i)the National Agency for
         Standardization and Metrology, and (ii)            the National Accreditation Agency.

 146.   Furthermore, supported by the second PRSO program, the Government has created
technical committees for the elaboration o f standards according to the WTO code and in line
with the EU framework for standardization under PRSO In. InFebruary 2006, the Georgian
Government approved Decree N45 on the acceptance o f the EU New Approach and Global
Approach Directives and set the rules for their enforcement.                       In addition, the National
Accreditation Agency regulates the accreditation o f agencies that assess compliance with
product technical regulations and/or standards, (e.g. accreditation laboratories, calibrating
laboratories, metrological testing laboratories, certifying and inspection agencies) in order to
introduce an internationally accepted system of laboratory accreditation for the quality control
o f Georgian products.            Towards the establishment o f a modem system for quality
infrastructure, the Government will be supported by the EU and the German Physico-
Technical Institute. Georgia has also applied for membership in COOMET and expects to
join in September 2006. During PRSO 111, Georgia i s expected to introduce a system o f
LaboratoryAccreditation for quality control that is consistent with international practice.

147.    The implementation of these reforms has contributed to the following outcomes:


    0   Private sector expansion. While the share o f the private sector in GDP remains at 65
        percent, there are indications that firms are responding well to the reforms
        implemented thus far. First, the non-oil pipeline FDI increased from under US$95


l6These problems were also identified as obstacles to export development in Georgia in the Trade Integrated
Study in2003.
17For a detailed description of the objectives o f each of these laws see The World Bank, First Poverty Reduction
Support Operation of Georgia, August 2005.

                                                         43

million in2003 to US$240 in2005. Second, there seems to be a growing tendency for
firms to move from shadow economy to the formal one. Estimates o f the informal
economy indicate a decline from 76 percent o f GDP in2003 to 67 percent in2005.

The time necessary to establish and operate a business. According to Doing Business
in2006 and 2007 the time neededto establish a business was reduced from 21 to 16
days. The amendments to the Tax Code approved by Parliament inApril 2006 reduce
the time for business registration from 21 to 5 days.       The cost o f establishing a
business was reduced from 13.7 percent to 10.9percent ofper capita income.

The time and cost of administrative procedure: According to Doing Business survey
for 2005 and 2006, Georgia made impressive progress in property registration: the
number o f days for registration was reduced from 39 to 9 days and cost was reduced
from 2.5 percent o f the property value to 0.6 percent. According to the BEEPS 2005
the average time spent by senior management dealing with public officials was
reduced from 11.5 weeks to 4.3 weeks. The estimates o f bribes as a share o f annual
sales as reported by surveyed firms was reduced from 2.7 percent in 2002 to 0.5
percent in2005.

Frequency of bribery at customs offices. According to BEEPS 2005 the share o f firms
reporting that bribery for customs clearance occurs frequently went down from 24 to
10 percent between 2002 and 2005. The portion o f surveyed firms reporting that
customs regulation i s a problem in doing business was reduced from 40 to 27 percent
duringthe sameperiod.

148.      Ingeneral, the reforms implemented to date have succeeded inimprovingthe business
environment in Georgia. As illustrated in Figure 2, businesses report problems in the
enforcement o f contracts, the functioning o f the judiciary, anti-competitive practices, access
and titling o f land, and transport. Government efforts in these areas are expected to continue
under the support from PRSO 111. Further measures are envisaged to strengthen the
institutional and technical capacity to implement the newly adopted laws and legislation, and
to ensure consistency across various legislative and regulatory frameworks. Improvement in
the competitiveness o f Georgian businesses requires an effort to put in place a system o f
standards, certification and quality control that meets international standards.


D.        Pillar 4: ImprovingSocial Protection, Education, and Health Care Services

Key Issues

149.      As presented in PRSO I,the social sectors in Georgia suffer from a number o f
structural, institutional, policy and governance issues that urgently need to be addressed in
order to improve their performance andoutcomes.

150.      Social Protection:         Social protection programs, consisting o f state pensions,"
various payments to vulnerable groups (poor elderly, disabled, orphans, etc.) and assistance to
internally displaced persons (IDPs), consume approximately 4.2 percent o f GDP. Most of the
resources are spent on pensions (about 3.2 percent o f GDP), followed by assistance to IDPsI9
(approximately 0.7 percent o f GDP) and cash assistance to the poor and vulnerable groups o f
the population (0.3 percent o f GDP). Eventhough social transfers are not sufficient to move
households out o f poverty, they play an important role in poverty alleviation (particularly
pensions as the largest program).               The new Government inherited significant arrears in
pensions and other social benefit payments. Since coming into power it has succeeded in
paying the social transfers on time and clearing a significant portion o f the arrears (it i s
expected that all the arrears will have been cleared by end-2006. Moreover, the Government
doubled pensions as o f January 1, 2005. From the poverty alleviation perspective this was an
important step, yet inreal terms pensions are barely higher thanin 1998. Inaddition, they are
still at least one-fourth below the extreme poverty line. The Government plans to increase
pensions inthe fall o f2006

151.      Social AssistancePrograms: Social protection faces a range o f institutional, financial,
policy, and implementation issues. The resources spent on social assistance programs are
insufficient to make a real difference to the extremely poor. Moreover, they are thinly spread
over too many fragmented programs, targeted mostly based on status (IDPs), merit (veterans
and other deserving citizens) or a social category (disabled, orphans, elderly, etc.). Hence, the
waste o f scarce resources (i.e.,              leakage to the non-poor) i s inevitable.               Program
implementation i s weak: the staff are poorly trained and paid; the record-keeping practice i s
outdated, and benefit delivery allows for leakage; and monitoring and evaluationbarely exist.


18More than 20 percent o f the population (0.9 million) are pensioners. Most o f them receive flat rate pensions
(approximately 28 GEL per month on average); although some categories are eligible for privileged pensions.
The pensions are the largest social transfers program, consuming about 3.2 percent o fGDP.
19The number of IDPs is approximately 226,500. The Ministry of Refugees and Resettlement is incharge o fthe
registration o f IDPs. Support to IDPsi s provided based on social needs, not status.

                                                        45

152.     Pensions: Inthe short to mediumterms the major challenges facing the state pension
system are the following: (i)   to continue paying pensions on time; (ii) increase pensions to
                                                                          to
about 25-30 percent o f the average wage (currently, the replacement rate i s at about 20
percent), and (iii)  to improve pension administration. In the long run, Georgia faces the
challenge o f developing an affordable, fiscally sustainable, diversified pension system that
would protect the elderly against poverty and provide for consumption smoothing. The first
step in achieving that goal i s the preparation and adoption o f a strategy for pension system
development.

153.     Education Sector: The Government is undertaking an ambitious program o f reform
and has made considerable progress in the introduction o f key policy reforms in the sector.
New legislation on general and higher education has been passed which puts in place a
framework for continued systemic reforms and quality improvements. The new Law on
General Education includes an emphasis on the decentralized management o f schools;
changes in financing including the introduction o f a per capita financing formula; and changes
in curriculum, teaching methods and assessment systems. However, this program is costly
and public spending on education will need to increase considerably and consistently to meet
all o fthe needed requests for financing.

154.     Expenditures on education in Georgia are comparable to levels observed in other
countries in the region. However, there are significant intra-sectoral resource allocation
problems. The bulk o f the education expenditures go to pay teacher salaries, leaving little
funding for improving the content o f education and the school-learning environment. Under
the Bank funded Education Realignment and Strengthening Project, a new teacher pay model
has been developed and adopted by the Government. The Government has paid all teacher
salary arrears and has almost doubled teacher salaries since September 2005. However with a
declining population, the size and structure o f the teaching force and the rationalization o f
facilities have become urgent. With falling enrollments and over 800 small schools, there are
clear questions o f efficiency to be addressed.

155.     As part o f the education reform, which focuses on the decentralization o f the
responsibility for general education to the school level, the Government has launched the
implementation o f a per capita financing model weighted for poorer areas since October 2005.
Total school expenditures are financed through vouchers from the central budget with funds
flowing directly to the school budget. The implementation o f the per capita formula is having
an immediate impact on the efficiency o f the system.            However, the mechanisms for
monitoring the financial impact o f the new funding scheme as well as a financial reporting
system are only now beingdeveloped and need to be adopted quickly.

156.     The state o f the education infrastructure is extremely poor, with many schools lacking
basic utilities and sanitary facilities. According to the Law, capital expenditures are to be paid
for by the state and/or local government and/or by private contribution from school boards.
The Government has developed a three-year state rehabilitation program to address this
problem and has requested the Bank's assistance through the APL I1 program, which i s
currently under preparation. However, maintenance o f the school infrastructure i s a serious
concern. A comprehensive strategy needs to be developed to ensure that sufficient funds are


                                                46

allocated for maintenance purposes after the schools are rehabilitated by the Government for
the longer term.

157.      Although equity inaccess to quality education remains a problem, the Government has
made impressive efforts aimed at improving the quality and relevance o f the education
system.        A highly sophisticated assessment system is being put in place which aims at
adopting both formative and summary evaluations at the school and national levels. Georgia
i s participating in the ongoing Progress for International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS)
2006 and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), 2007. As part o f
the ongoing pilot o f a new curriculum inthe selected schools, the mechanisms for classroom-
based student assessment are being developed and piloted. However, not all the pieces o f the
Quality Assurance system envisaged by the Government are as yet in place. There are still
some gaps in the national assessment, particularly at the upper secondary education level.
This requires that a coherent approach to measuring quality be developed.

158.      The data available on the quality o f the education system are poor. A statistical unit
has been set up in the Ministry o f Education and Science (MoES) to coordinate the data
collection and analysis o f the sector. There are now several sources o f conflicting data, and,
partly due to this, it actually appears that Georgia may not meet the basic Education for All
criteria, although progress in the strategic Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) is good.
Inparticular, data on the retentionof children to the end ofprimary school appear poor. The
availability o f good quality data has now become a crucial issue in measuring the success o f
the education program and planning for its needs.20 With such a large number o f reforms
under way, it is crucial that the success of these changes is monitored, andthat they are fully
understoodbythe general population andthe educationprofessionals.

159.      At the higher education and vocational levels, the Government is also being proactive
inre-designing the system. Initial steps to close a number of inefficient and even fraudulent
colleges have been taken. The Government hasjoined the Bologna process which will mean
that universities will need to modernize their management systems and ensure compatibility in
standards with other European universities. A universal university entrance examination,
which measures aptitude as well as skills, was run for the first time in 2005 as an attempt to
put inplace transparent criteria for entrance to higher educationinstitutions.

160.      Health Sector: The health sector continues to face significant challenges. Health
outcomes are stagnant or worsening. Georgia i s one o f the few countries in the CIS in which
important MillenniumDevelopment Goals inhealth-early                   childhood mortality and maternal
m o r t a l i t y 4 0 not exhibit a positive trend. In addition, non-communicable diseases causing
premature adult mortality seem to be increasing.               Georgia has the lowest health service
utilization inthe Europe and Central Asia Region, with less than 2 outpatient visits per capita
and less than 5 inpatient visits per 100people. Being illincreases the probability ofbecoming
poor, as 10percent more individuals fall below the poverty line after incurring hospitalization
expenditures.         As a result, only 43 percent o f the poorest quintile seeks care for chronic
illnesses compared to 62 percent of the richest quintile. As out-of-pocket expenditures are
required for receiving care, 73 percent o f the chronically ill cite lack of resources as the



2o N e w data for 2004-05 have been collected but need to be Wher analyzed.

                                                        47

principal reason for not utilizing health services. Poor people have to pay more than rich
people for health care services, not only inrelative but also inabsolute terms.

161.    A number o f reasons can be cited for the deteriorating health outcomes, the low
utilization rates and the high out-of-pocket payments. Public spendingon heath is less than 1
percent o f GDP or GEL18.8 (around US$lO) per capita annually. The under-financing o f the
health sector i s coupled with inefficiencies in the management o f public resources (e.g. the
allocation o f funding based on historical budgets, contracts with all public health providers,
and so on). The scope o f services financed by public resources, the Basic Benefit Package
(BBP), has expanded, mostly for political reasons, from 14 programs in 1995 to more than 22
major programs at present, while the available budget has remained largely the same. Funds
from the special program for the vulnerable and poor were used to provide services to people
irrespective o f their income level. There is a highnumber o f health care providers at both the
primary and the hospital level, thus spreading the limited budget thinly and leading to high
fixed costs for health care delivery.

The Government Reform Program

162.     The Government's program for improvingthe delivery o f social services is reflected in
the EDPRP. The proposed PRSO I1together with the other Bank investment projects would
support the implementation o f the reform program inthe areas o f social protection, education,
and health. The PRSO will not support any specific program related to the IDPs, which are
supported by other donor activities.

163.    Social Protection. The Government program under the PRSO focuses on two areas:
(i)the implementation of a targeted social assistance program aimed at bringing the
consumption o f the extremely poor households at least to the level o f the extreme poverty
line; and (ii)the development o f a sustainable solution for minimum protection against
poverty in old age. The Government has placed poverty alleviation as its immediate priority
and intends to introduce a number o f measures are aimed at raising the living standards o f
extremely poor households.        To that end, the Government introduced a targeted social
assistance program for the extreme poor households inTbilisi inAugust 2006, and extended it
nationwide in September 2006. Eligibility was based on the household economic and social
status (a proxy-means testing formula combined with a field visit). Most o f the existing
fragmented social assistance programs are being consolidated into the targeted poverty
benefit, providing for more efficient and effective use o f scarce resources (additional
resources to cover the extreme poverty gap are planned as well). As far as pension system
development is concerned, there is an ongoing discussion within and outside o f the
Government on options for pension reform in Georgia. The World Bank is finalizing a Note
on Options for Pension Reform in Georgia; the Government expects the Note to inform the
debate and facilitate the strategic choices.

164.    (4-4) To implement a targeted social assistanceprogram, underthe second PRSOthe
following actions have been implemented:




                                               48

    0  A fiscally sustainable, targeted social assistance program was introduced and is fully
       operational.    Targeting and administrative benchmark indicators were established.
       And adequate resources, within the fiscal envelope, were budgeted.

165.   (4-ii) To develop a sustainable solution for minimum protection against poverty in
old age, under the second PRSO, the following actions were implemented:

       The strategy for long term-pension reform was adopted by the Government and the
       corresponding legal framework for affordable, equitable, and fiscally sustainable
       protection o f the elderly against poverty was enacted.


    0  Pensions are being paid on time as is evidenced by the absence o f new arrears.

166.   The third PRSO envisions supporting the monitoring and evaluation o f success with
the implementation o f the targeted social assistance program to guide the direction o f reform
with regard to changes in the targeting mechanism and/or program implementation
arrangements. Other reforms include the following: (i)   pensions have continued to be paid on
time and no additional arrears have accumulated; and (ii)the implementation o f legal
provisions for affordable, equitable, and fiscally sustainable protection o f the elderly against
poverty have continued.

167.   Education. The main objective o f the Government's reform program in the education
sector i s to create a system that develops the physical and mental abilities o f the younger
generation; ensures the availability and transparency o f general education; ensures the
efficient management o f the general education system; and supports inclusive education. To
achieve these goals, the Government program focuses on the areas o f education finance,
equity inaccess to quality education, and the proper management o f the teaching workforce.

168.    ( 4 3 To improve the quality of general education, the Government program,
supported by the PRSO, focuses on strengthening the policy and management capacity
including the development o f an information base for policymaking and the efficient use o f
human and physical resources. In line with this objective, under the second PRSO, the
following measures were implemented:

        Georgia i s participating fully inthe current TIMSS andPIRLs.

        National assessments were implemented in the selected subjects in the 4th and gth
        grades, and work was initiated to develop tools and guidelines for the schools for
        conducting interim and graduating examinations.

        Satisfactory progress has been achieved in developing prototype quality assurance
        arrangements for the general secondary system, including student assessments at the
        classroom level and the establishment o f mechanisms for institutional and staff
        accreditationand licensing systems;
        A Per capita financing formula has been adopted and rolledout on a nationwidebasis.
        A monitoring system and financial and performance monitoring report are under
        development.


                                                49

     0  The collection and the corresponding analysis o f education data including MDG data
        are under way and an action plan o f targeted programs is being developed to identify
        issues and corresponding remedial actions.


169.    The third PRSO envisions supporting reforms aimed at further implementing the
systematic quality assurance arrangements in the school system; monitoring the results o f
TIMSS and PIRLS and other national assessments under way which will shed light on the
quality o f the education system; and (based on the analysis o f the updated MDG database)
initiating the implementation o f the action plan o f the targeted program developed.

170.    Health. The reform i s aimed at increasingthe available financial resources, improving
efficiency in budget management, and promoting equity, solidarity and quality in the
provision o f health care. Nevertheless, the results have yet to be realized. As has been
mentioned, public financing remains low while health insurance contributions were abolished
after the Rose Revolution in favor o f a flat tax rate. The entity responsible for the collection
o f health insurance contributions (SUSIF), although it has lost one o f its functions, still plays a
vital role in pooling public funds (central and local) and as the main purchaser o f health
services.      The BBP has expanded to include a number o f catastrophic and tertiary care
services, which require adequate funding. Health care providers continue to be financed by
public monies since SUSIF is forced to contract with all o f them based on historical budgets.
Regarding decentralization, municipalities have spent less than the amount designated by law
(3 percent o f the municipal budget) on health and there are significant concerns regarding
their managerial capacity to undertake the responsibilities assigned to them by the reform
process.

171.    The Government is also planning to revise the publicly financed health program
(Basic Benefit Package, BBP) to protect families from the impoverishing impact o f the cost o f
illness. The Government intends the BBP to be provided to the entire population and to be
simple and clear inthe structure o f services and user charges. To help address the problem o f
corruption, notice boards will be displayed in public hospitals and polyclinics notifying
citizens about organizational budgets, service entitlements and user charges required.21 The
Government has expressed its intention to rehabilitate/construct strategic facilities in order to
create a regional hospital network, while it understands that the financial viability o f such a
network will depend crucially on a parallel consolidation o f the remaining facilities. The
detailed process for the modernization o f the sector will be outlined in the revised
modernization strategy for the hospital sector.22 The PRSO program will support the creation
o f the regional hospital network provided it i s accompanied by a downsizing o f the total
number o fhospital facilities inthe country.

172.    Under the PRSO program the Government initiated significant changes in the health
sector in 2005 in order to address some o f the challenges presently faced by the system. The
reforms implemented included the following :


21 See Section V-A on Strengthening Public Sector Accountability, Efficiency, and Accountability.
22 This work is being supported under the Structural Reform Support Project of the World Bank under the
coordination o f the HealthPolicy Unit at the National Institute o f Health.


                                                        50

    0   Increased the level o fpublic financing for health care services

    0   Developed a short-term and medium-term strategy for the health sector and its
        implementationplan

    0   Revisedthe BBP

    0   Improvedthe targeting o f health services to the poor.


173.    (4-iv) To improve health sector performance and to provide access to essential
quality health services, the Government under the second PRSO has implemented the
following measures:


    0   The BBP was defined and piloted intwo regions. The BBP i s composed o f a universal
        package applicable to the whole population and a supplemental package applicable to
        the poor. The universal package i s being piloted inthe renovated Primary Health Care
        (PHC) facilities in Ajara and Imereti, while the supplemental package i s budgeted and
        preparations are under way for national level implementation.

    0   The PHC master plan was developed and adopted and the hospital sector master plan
        was developed, and the integration is under way to rationalize health service
        organization and reduce excess capacity.

    0   A policy framework and a strategy to reform licensing and quality control and
        assurance in health facilities were adopted, and the regulation o f health professionals
        was developed.

    0   The development of a comprehensive policy framework for pharmaceuticals was
        initiated.

174.    The third PRSO envisions supporting reforms aimed at fine-tuning the BBP and
implementing it on nationwide basis. The third PRSO also envisions supporting Georgia's
efforts to implement o f an integrated hospital sector and PHC master plan, which i s expected
to result inreducing the number o f publicly financed hospitals and implementingthe strategy
to reform licensing and quality assurance mechanisms inthe health sector. And adopting the
policy framework for pharmaceuticals in2007.

175.    The implementation o f these reforms seems to be contributing to improvements inthe
delivery o fbasic social services.


    0   First, the Government has adopted a significantly improved methodology for
        estimating poverty that i s based on an updated minimum consumption basket for the
        households. According to most recent data, extreme poverty declined from 14.6 to
        13.6 percent in 2003-04, but increased to 15.5 percent between 2004 and 2005,
        reflecting the undergoing structural changes inthe Georgian economy.

    0   The introduction o f targeted social assistance to the extreme poor under PRSO I1is by
        far the most important and direct measure undertaken to reduce extreme poverty.



                                               51

    e   There has been a significant improvement in poverty monitoring and assessment
        mechanisms.

    e   The number o f the extreme poor households receiving targeted social assistance in
        September 2006 was 80,000. This i s expected to rise to 130,000 by the end o f 2006.

176.    Similarly, education andhealth care services appear to be improving.

    e   Measures to curb corruption and improve educational services have been effective.

    e   Teachers are going through a process o f certification while at the same time their
        salaries have been increased. Students no longer have to buy admissions, grades, or
        degrees. School facilities are beingrepaired or modernized.

    e   Participation in TIMSS and P E S has allowed the benchmarkingo f Georgia relative
        to other countries inthe area of education.

    e   The ongoing monitoring of service quality and informal payments in schools, as well
        as other point o f service delivery surveys expected under the PRSO, is giving the
        Government tools for actively monitoring the impact o f its reforms in the quality o f
        and access to education.

    e   Increasedpublic financing for health care and better targeting o fprimary care access to
       the poor are gradually improving the delivery o fhealth care services.

    e  According to household survey data, the utilization o f health care by the poorest two
       quintiles increased from 3.5 percent o f total consumption expenditures to 4.53 percent
       in2005. By the end of the PRSOprogram, this is expected to increase by20 percent
        from the rate at the beginningo fthe program.


                         VI.    OPERATIONIMPLEMENTATION

A.     ImplementationandMonitoringof the Operation

177.   The Ministry of Finance (MoF) will act as the main coordinator for managing the
overall implementation o f the PRSO.           The M O F also actively participates in the
implementation o f EDPRP goals, while the overall coordination o f the EDPRP i s the
responsibility o f Ministry of Economic Development. The primary implementing line
agencies for the PRSO program are: the Ministries o f Finance, Economic Development,
Health, Labor and Social Affairs, Education and Science, Energy, the Public Service Bureau,
the Office of the State Minister on Reform Coordination, the State Procurement Agency, and
the Chamber o f Control.

178.   The monitoring o fthe reform program will also be carried out through regular reviews
and in the context of the supervision o f this operation as well as the preparation o f the third
PRSO. Progress in the implementation o f policy measures will be hrther monitored through
other Bank financed projects, including those that complement actions supported under the
PRSO program. The monitoring o f public sector reforms as well as public expenditures on



                                               52

social sectors i s o f particular importance. Agreement has been reached with the Government
to produceperiodic information inthese areas.


B.      Disbursement

179.    The proposed Operation is an IDA Credit o f SDR 13.5 million (US$20 million
equivalent) i s being co-financed by the Dutch Government in the amount o f 7 million Euro
and by the European Commission's Macroeconomic Financial Assistance program in the
amount of around 11millionEuro. The Operation o fthe IDA Credit o f SDR 13.5 millionwill
bereleased inone tranche upon effectiveness. The Operation will be subject to ratificationby
Parliament before it becomes effective. The IDA Credit will be on standard IDA terms, with a
40 year maturity, including a 10 year grace period. The expected closing date o f the proposed
secondPRSO is July 31,2007.

180.    The proposed second PRSOwill be disbursedinUnitedStates dollars into a dedicated
Foreign Currency Account for PRSO I1at the National Bank o f Georgia (NBG) that will have
been opened by the Ministry o f Finance o f Georgia (MoF) on terms and conditions
satisfactory to the IDA. Thereafter, the United States dollars inthe Foreign Currency Account
for PRSO I1will be sold promptly (within 30 days o f disbursement) by the MOF to the NBG
in return for an equivalent Georgian lari amount to be deposited into the Treasury Single
Account (the account in lari o f the MoF to finance budgeted expenditures and kept at the
NBG). The MoF will be responsible for the Operation's administration and for preparingthe
withdrawal application, maintaining the Foreign Currency Account for the PRSO I1at the
NBG as required and arranging for its timely audit (see also paragraph 184). The MoF, with
the assistance o f the NBG, will maintain records o f all transactions under the Operation in
accordance with sound accounting practices. The MoF will provide to the IDA a confirmation
that the amount o f the Operation has been credited to an account that i s available to finance
budgeted expenditures.


C.      FiduciaryArrangements

181.    Review of foreign exchange reserves management. The IMF conducted a safeguards
assessment o f the NBG in January 2002. The IMF was encouraged by the measures taken by
the NBGinthe areas of financial reporting, internal audit, and cash management to strengthen
procedures. Nonetheless, staff noted further room for improvement inthese areas, as well as
weaknesses in aspects o f the internal control environment o f the MBG, particularly in the
foreign exchange management and accounting functions.           Together, the IMF and NBG
devised and agreed upon a set o f measures to improve and strengthen the NBG's fiduciary
arrangements. After two sets o f update reviews in2005 and 2006, the IMF was satisfied that
the NBG had fully implemented all but three o f the measures agreed upon in the 2002 and
subsequent reviews to strengthen the N B G s fiduciary arrangements. In respect o f the three
measures that were not fully implemented: two were partially implemented or are inprogress
and the status o f the other measure was not monitoredby the IMF.
182.    The NBG received an unqualified audit opinion from its auditors, Deloitte & Touche,
on its latest published financial statements being in respect o f the year ended December 31,
2005.


                                                53

183.   Public financial management system. The findings and conclusions o f various
assessments o f the Georgian public financial management system have been incorporated
within and indeed are integral to the design o f the PRSO. These assessments include: the
World Bank's September 2003 Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA)23, the
IMF's October 2003 Report on the Observance o f Standards and Codes - Fiscal Transparency
Module24;the World Bank's June 2002 Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR)25;
and the World Bank's November 2003 Public Expenditure Review (PER)26. The salient
public financial management issues from these assessments as well as issues arising since the
publication o f these assessmentshave been summarized, and progress has been discussed and
addressed as appropriate elsewhere in the Program Document and the Letter o f Development
Policy.
184.   Auditing. The audit o f the First Poverty Reduction Support Operation was unqualified
and revealed no issues o f concern. Under the PRSO 11, the MoF will, by no later than April
20, 2007, provide to the IDA evidence that the proceeds o f the Operation have been credited
to the Single Treasury Account to finance budgeted expenditures. In addition, the MOF will
arrange for the audit o f the Foreign Currency Account o f PRSO 11in accordance with the
terms o f reference and by independent auditors acceptable to the IDA; and for the audit report
to be submittedto the IDA no later than April 30,2007.
D.      EnvironmentalAspects

185.    While this Operationwould not require an environmental assessment, as the envisaged
reforms should not have a direct impact on the environment, particular attention will be paid
to the environmental impact in the following two areas-the              energy sector and SOE sector
restructuring and privatization. Inthe course o f the implementation o f the second PRSO and
the preparation o f the third Operation, strategic environmental assessments could be
conducted as necessary.
186.   Energy Sector. In the Bank's PSIA o f September 25, 2003, one o f the conclusions
was that electricity tariff increases in Tbilisi may not have caused a shift to dirtier fuel
consumption, as the increased use o f clean and inexpensive natural gas took place instead.
Outside o f Tbilisi, a substantial number o f households continue to burn wood, and the use o f
improved wood burning technologies could produce welfare gains. Overall, sector reform
would mostly have a positive environmental impact. Tariffs at cost level, and improved
metering systems and collections, would have a significant, dampening effect on consumption
and thus on greenhouse gas emissions. The environmental impact o f rehabilitating existing
substations and power lines i s benign. With more private participation in the energy sector in
the future, the Government should ensure that private investors meet adequate environmental
standards intheir operations and investments.
187.    The planned rehabilitation o f the north-south gas transit pipeline will reduce leakages
o f methane gas to the atmosphere and may be eligible for financial support from carbon
trading under the Clean Development Mechanism o f the Kyoto Protocol.                         Pipeline
rehabilitation work will, however, be undertaken in environmentally sensitive areas and the

Government should ensure that adequate environmental standards are met during the
rehabilitation work. The new Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) oil pipeline will transport its first
oil across Georgian territory in the fall o f 2005, and the South Caucasus Pipeline (SCP) for
gas which i s under construction will transit and deliver gas from late 2006 according to plans.
The Bank has provided funding for technical assistance and capacity building for the
Government to address the environmental issues o f these two pipeline projects.

188.    SOE Restructuring and Privatization.           In addition to the improvement o f the
investment and business climate, the Government has progressed significantly with the
restructuring and privatizing o f the SOEs. The privatization process which covered a list o f
approximately 300 o f the largest SOEs in 2000-03 moved rapidly during 2004-05 generating
US$270.4 million o f proceeds. In the first eight months o f 2006, large enterprises in the
energy and telecommunications sectors were privatized. For enterprises that are potentially
harmhl for the environment, the authorities have undertaken and included an environmental
impact assessment as part o f the privatization process or management contract. Furthermore,
the Government recognizes the need to design and implement a privatization program that
incorporates a number o f basic and important principals including: transparency and equal
access to information; fair value; competitive case-by-case privatization including the transfer
o f residual state ownership; and a sufficient time line to allow for defensive restructuring
which i s needed for some o f the enterprises prior to their privatization.

E.      Poverty and Social Impact Assessment

189.    The PRSO i s designed to improve living standards in Georgia by: (i)       strengthening
public sector accountability, efficiency, and transparency; (ii)    improving electricity and gas
sector services; (iii)improving the environment for private sector development; and (iv)
improving social protection, education, and health care services.           The two areas with
potentially the greatest immediate impact on living standards are reforms inthe power sector
and the social protection system.          In order to assess their impact, as part of the
implementation o f the first and second PRSOs and the preparation o f the third PRSO, a
Programmatic Poverty Assessment program i s being implemented in parallel with the PRSO
program inorder to assess the impact o fthe PRSO, especially on the lower income groups.

190.    Inthe energy sector, the PRSO supports Government initiatives to attain financial
viability for sector entities. Payment collections in power distribution outside o f Tbilisi will
still have to increase somewhat, although remaining electricity theft now may be a larger
problem. It i s not yet clear whether the large tariff adjustments in June 2006 are entirely
sufficient for obtaining full cost recovery in the sector (particularly when considering the
needs for continued investments). Cost recovery, full collections, and control o f electricity
theft are necessary inorder to achieve a sustainable electricity service with a service level that
i s adequate for economic development and that improves living conditions in Georgia. A
PSIA carried out by the Bank, dated September 2003, concluded that households in Tbilisi
had a power consumption level close to basic needs and that demand was inelastic, thus
suggesting that tariff increases, such as the one in June 2006, would be associated with
significant welfare losses. Under this PRSO, as energy reforms are targeted to areas outside o f
Tbilisi, welfare losses are likely to occur among this population group in the short term and
possibly the medium term. To address this impact, the Government has adopted a block tariff
and provides additional energy assistance to vulnerable groups.


                                                55

191.    The social protection system will undergo a major reform with the objective o f
reducing the incidence of extreme poverty in Georgia. The Government has introduced a
targeted cash family poverty benefit in mid-2006. The benefit targets 14 percent o f Georgian
families (about 400,000 people) which i s based on the estimation of extreme poverty in 2005.
Families found eligible for the benefit (based on an assessment o f their social and economic
status) will receive regular monthly cash social assistance during a period o f one year. The
specific benefit amount will depend on a household's assessed income; the benefit will top up
the existing income to the extreme povertybenchmark.
192.    In order to assess the impact of the reform of the social protection system, two
activities will be undertaken.First, inorder to monitor the impact, the Government i s planning
an evaluation o f the program at the beginning o f 2007-a        year after the benefit has been
introduced. Second, as part o fthe Programmatic Poverty Assessment program, which i s being
carried out in parallel with the PRSO program, the effectiveness o f the reforms will be
assessed.
F.       Benefits, Risks and Risk Mitigation

193.     This operation has several primary benefits. First and foremost, the PRSO program
supports cross-cutting anti-corruption efforts and measures to improve governance which will
improve the investmentclimate as well as increase the access to and affordability o f key social
services by the poor.     Stronger public expenditure management and accountability will
improve the strategic allocation o f resources and will contribute to fiscal sustainability.
Improved electricity and gas supply and services will mitigate one o f the key impediments to
business as well as contributing directly to improved living standards for the poor, notably, for
those outside the capital.     Simplification and clarification of the rules and regulations
governing business activities would provide further stimulus to private sector activity, while
the reforms envisaged in key social programs would improve the quality and targeting o f
social services and social protection for the poor.
194.     The proposed operation faces several risks. The main risk i s the Government's
limitedcapacity to coordinate, manage and implementthe wide rangeofreforms inwhich the
authorities are simultaneously engaged. The PRSO program has been designed to focus only
on the key strategic elements o f such a broad program within a programmatic approach.
Meanwhile, the Government i s making a strong effort to ensure the consistency o f its policy      ,
reforms across various agenda, and i s taking direct initiatives to address capacity weaknesses.
The IDA is actively supporting these initiatives-for   example, through the ongoing Structural
Reform Support Credit and the Public Sector Reform Project. More generally, the PRSO
program has a strong focus on areas in which donor technical assistance i s ongoing or
expected in the near term. Inthe course o f preparation, the task team has consulted closely
with other donors on the potential scope oftheir participation incapacity enhancement efforts.
Current plans include joint analytical work, technical assistance and learninghraining
activities.
195.    Georgia faces significant but manageable macroeconomic risks and vulnerabilities.
Domestic risks and vulnerabilities include: (i)public spending pressures related to the
forthcoming electoral cycles; and (ii) a limited response o f the economy in terms o f domestic
investment and net job creation to the reform program. External risks and vulnerabilities
include: (i) further increases in energy prices, particularly in the context of the move to the
market pricing o f gas supplies within the region; (ii)
                                                      limited progress on trade and investment

                                               56

diversification; and (iii) than expected FDIand/or remittance flows. Provided that there
                         lower
i s prudent macroeconomic management, and provided the implementation o f structural
reforms continues, these risks and vulnerabilities are manageable.

196.    Other risks include deterioration in the political and/or security environment.      An
emerging risk is that o f reform fatigue-not          among the authorities who continue to
demonstrate very strong drive and commitment, but rather among the stakeholders.             The
authorities continue to proceed at a very fast pace with a wide range o f critical reforms, some
o f which may be vulnerable in the absence o f a broad stakeholder consensus that often takes
time to build. The Bank is taking efforts to mitigate this risk with respect to the reforms
supported by the PRSO program by supporting the dialogue with the civil society and the
private sector.

197.    Rekindled tensions in the regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia had raised risks
somewhat o f a deterioration inthe security environment. The resolution o f the Adjara issue is
a welcome development and it i s hoped that continued international efforts will contribute to
the peaceful resolution o f the remaining territorial disputes.

                                               Georgia

    Dew Mr.Wolfowitz,


    I. Georgia has maintained macroeconomic stability and continues to make progress in
   further implementation of structural and policy reforms in line with our poverty reduction
   strategy. Our reform program aims at rcducing poverty Ihrough sustainable and inclusive
   economic growth and involves six pillars: (i)strengthening governance; (ii)improving macro
   fiscal performance; (iii) improving the business environmcnt; (iv) reducing the vulntrabilit> of
   the poor: (v) enhancingdevelopmentJ f humancapital;and (vi) protectingthe cnvironmcnt.

   2.      We requested IDA assistance through a series of annual Poverty Reduction Support.
   Operation (PKSO) last year to implement several areas of our poverty reduction strawy. 'lhc
   first PRSO was approved on September 15. 2005. 'The governnient remains           full^^committed to
   the ruform measures supported under the tirst PRSO, as specified in our i..eercr of Ilevclopmrnr

   3.      We hlieve Georgia's economic developments of the last year have lzern i!npressi(e
   despite the unexpected difficulties that we faced in 2005 and thc early 2006, icicfuding Flood,
   power cuts, avian flu, and the recent outlaw of Georgian wine and mineral water by tZussia. We
   managed these shocks despite our limited financial resources. In 2005. real CiOP had a
   remarkable growth of 9.3 percent; inflation remained at a single digit levcl through careful
   coordination of monetary and fiscal policics; revenue collection continued 1.0 increasc and
   substantial amount of wages and pensions arrears accumulated over the l o a several years were
   cleared. We were able to make key strategic investment in our basic iufrastructuE to support
   better invcstnient and growth performancc. The Government has cracked down on corruption
   decisivelyand has restructured and streamlined the government apparaius significantly.

with outlook `positive'. Also, the World Bank ranked Georgia among the top reformers in the
region and the number 2 reformer globally in the Doing Business study for 2006. Similarly,
Doing Business 2007 determined that globally Georgia is number 1 reformer. Business
Environment and Enterprisc Performance Survey (BEEPS), a joint initiative of the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank states that Georgia saw the
largest reduction in corruption among all transition countries in 2002-2005.

5.      The key challenge is to sustain the reform momentum and build upon the recent gains in
economic growth and poverty reduction by pursuing our policy reform and governance
improvementagenda. We welcomed the World BanWIMF initiative to support the elaboration of
our Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Program (or Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper as it is known in Georgia) as an opportunity for us to formulate a medium-term
development strategy. The initiative came at an opportune moment for Georgia to solidify these
achievements and to ensure that future growth is shared more broadly to benefit the entire
population. In August 2006, we finalized the second EDPRP ProgressReport.

6.       Our consultationwith the World Bank during the preparationofthe first PRSO led to the
identification of four reform areas in our medium term reform strategy: (i)strengtheningpublic
sector accountability, efficiency and transparency; (ii) improving electricity and gas sector
services; (iiij improving the environment for private sector development; and (iv) improving
social protection, educationand health care services. The first component, namely, strengthening
public sector accountability, efficiency and transparency, is aimed at improving public resource
management and service delivery, government administration systems and institutional
arrangements, and directly addresses Georgia's capacity constraintsand institutional weaknesses.
The second component includes reforms aimed at addressing the severe situation in the
electricity and gas sectors. The reforms of the third component are aimed at improving the
business climate to strengthen the foundations of private sector-led growth. And the reforms o f
the fourth component are aimed at improving our social safety net, supporting development of
humancapital through reforms in education, and improving efficiency and effectiveness of health
care services.

7.      Supported by the first PRSO we began to address these challenges by taking a number of
policy and institutional reform actions which have helped us makeconsiderableprogress with the
implementation of our medium term reform program. This letter outlines our recent
achievements with the second PRSO (PRSO 11) supported reforms, and further measures that we
are committed to undertake under the third PRSO (PRSO Ill)program which would help us
achievethe outcomes we aimed.

Pillar 1: Strengthening Public Sector Accountability, Efficiency and Transparency

Strengrhening Public Budgeting and Expenditure Management

8.      Improving management of public finances is at the core of our efforts to strengthen
accountability and public service delivery. Under the first PRSO, we initiated the development
of a Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).               The framework has contributed to

improving the policy content of annual budget preparation and achieving greater transparency
and accountability in budget planning and expenditure management.               We have made
considerable progress in integrating our national strategy priorities with the MTEF and the
annual budget process.

9.      In 2005 a start was made with introducing the MTEF with a four-year horizon. From the
start of the reform program, the MTEF has been an integral part o f the budget preparation
process, following the time table and requirements of the Budget System Law. The first
milestonewas the Basic Data and Directions (BDD) 2006-2009 document, which incorporateda
detailedassessment of our medium-tern resource envelope, based on revenue forecasts from our
macroeconomic framework. The second achievement was the Budget Circular, which for the first
time contained four-year expenditure ceilings for all spending agencies. The third improvement
concerned the Explanatory Notes to the budget required by the Budget Law, which now give a
better insight into the priorities and spending plansofthe line ministries.

10.     The budget preparation process was further improved in 2006. This concerns first and
foremost the 2007-2010 BDD, which was prepared by the Minister of Finance in close
cooperation with State Minister of Economic Reforms Coordination has been issued by the
Cabinet of Ministers with active involvement of the line ministries. As a result, the BDD is a
comprehensive document, containing: (i)the Medium-Term Action Strategy of the Government
of Georgia; (ii)medium-term macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts; (iii) medium-term priority
directions defined by the ministries ir order to achieve the overall aims and objectives; and (iv)
preliminary expenditures ceilings for line ministries covering the period 2007-2010. We are
presently working on improving the Budget Circular, and especially on better budget
instructions,which will form the basis for improvedquality of budget submissions.

11.     We prepared a 2005 budget execution report and submitted it to Parliament. In 2004, we
cleared more than 60 percent of expenditure arrears accumulated by the previous government.
We further processed and cleared claims in 2005 and are now working vigorously to screen
legitimacyof remainingclaims in view of clearance of the remaining arrears in the shortest delay
bearing in mind the macroeconomic stability imperatives. Furthermore, the commitment control
system preventsthe appearanceof new arrears.


Enhancing Transparency and Efficiency in the Public Procurement System

12.     Our objective in the area of public procurement is to promote increased transparency and
accountability in that system. For this purpose, over the last two years, we took a number of
steps to follow up on the recommendations of the 2002 Country Procurement Assessment
Review(CPAR). New Law of Georgiaon State Procurements became effective in January 2006.
The new law extends its coverage to state owned enterprises (SOEs) and streamlines                 '
procurement procedures. We reducedthe number of procuring entities from initial 8,000 to 3,000
and permanent procurement units were established within each procuring entity.               The
Administrative Code and Code on Administrative Violations were amended to make
procurement fraud a punishable crime. Furthermore, the Parliament o f Georgia validated the

amendment to the State Procurement Law, as part of our WTO commitments, to become a
signatory to the Government Procurement Agreement.

13.     We launched the State Procurement Agency (SPA) website and started publishing tender
announcements for procurements by central state entities. Supported by PRSO I,we made
several improvementsto the website by (i)postingthe SPA 2004 and 2005 Annual Procurement
Reports on the website to provide information on procurement procedures, (ii) including more
comprehensive information about procurement data, upcoming bidding opportunities,
announcements on contract awards and administrative review decisions pertaining to
procurement-relateddisputes, and (iii)adding an updated registry of providers for goods, works
and services. .

14.     As part of PRSO 11, the SPA has maintained publication of its procurement activity,
through its website and the further development of key indicators to monitor procurement
performance. We submitted a further amendment to the Law on State Procurementto allow for
international practice on retroactive financing. We have rationalized the list of confidential
procurement items. We have also established fair and transparent administrative procedures for
blacklisting companies and individuals found to have engaged in violation of procurement
proceduresand/or intent of fraud and corruption, and strengthenedthe specialized unit within the
SPA conductingadministrative reviews.

15.      During PRSO 111. the SPA will continue publication of procurement processes. activity
and performance, as well as remedial action proposed to address deficiencies. The procurement
blacklist and procurement audit findings will also be publishedand we will ensure that broader
anti-corruption initiatives include reporting and hotlinesfor procurementcomplaints and hhistle-
blowing. At the same time, the Public Procurement Improvement Measures will be updated and
priority actionsofthe forthcoming CPAR Update implementedas appropriate.

Improving the Transparency and Effectiveness of Public Financial Management

16.     We have been implementing reformsaimed at improving transparency in public financial
managementwhich are supported by the PRSO program. We have made considerable progress
in strengthening the Treasury system. We realizethat Treasury reform, aiming at introductionof
international accounting standards and establishing a Public Financial Management System
(PFMS), will require several years of sustained effort. We have made good progress towards
integrating all treasury expenditure and revenue accounts into the Treasury Single Account.
Under PRSO 11, the Treasury Single Account for the central government became fully
operational. We have also expanded Treasury rules and guidelines nationwide. The Treasury
has been producing consolidated monthly cash and commitment reports covering the central
government. We expanded the coverage of the commitment control systems to Tbilisi
municipality and to Georgia's other large cities' municipalities. Under PRSO Ill,we plan to
expand the commitment control systems to other smaller cities-progress    in this area is suhject
to building technical capacity at local level.

17.     We have adopted and initiated a strategy to produce annual consolidated financial
statements in accordance with internationally acceptedaccountingand reporting standards Going
forward, the strategy includesactions to develop a GFS 2001-compliant budget classification,(b)
measures to implement the cash-based Treasury General Ledger incorporating the new budget
classification; and (c) actions to produce:consolidated cash and commitment reports for central
and decentralized levels of government.

18.     We have prepared revisions to legislation regarding the judicial status of public and
quasi-publicentities, specifically defining the criteria for differentiating between public entities,
SOEs, and LEPLs. Amendments to the Civil Code of Georgia were approved by the Cabinet
and are submitted to the Parliament. The amendmentssuggest widening the definition of the non-
profit bodies, lifting some restrictions,which will in turn allow many ofthe existing LEPLs to be
transformed into non-profit bodies. This particularly regards LEPLs in education, culture and
healthcare fields. The final aim is to reclassify organizations as required by GFSM-2001
standards. As a first step to strengthen financial discipline, including LEPLs, under PRSO 11, we
have developed a register of all LEPLs, and are in the process of defining specific requirements
for their financial and performancereporting.

19.      Furthermore, the Chamber of Control, which is one of the most important institution in
the control of fraud and corruption in Georgia, resumed its auditing functions under PRSO Iand
drafted a Strutegv for Corporate Development and Reorganization Implementation Plan and
published its main findings and recommendations. It has also published a Five Year Training
Planfor 2006-2011, a complete list of finalized audits undertakenin the first half of 2005 as well
as the audit plan for the year. The strategy describes in detail how the Chamber aims to achieve
its objectives as independent government auditors with high quality services, including overall
direction, range of competences, organizational structure, governing law, human resources,
informationtechnology, and training.

20.     Under PRSO 11, we amended the legislation as required to elevate the mandate of the
Chamber of Control and its responsibility to a Supreme Audit Institution so that it can function as
an external auditor according to International Organization of Supreme Audit Institutions
(INTOSAI) standards. The draft law is currently under discussion in Parliament and we expect
that it will be passed by early 2007.        The Chamber of Control would then develop a
comprehensive external audit methodology and quality assurance system. In addition, we have
finalized and adopted the corporatestrategy for the reorganizationofthe Chamber of Control.

Strengthening Local Governance and Intergovernmental Fiscal Relations

21.     We are committed to substantial improvementin public service delivery. Acknowledging
the weaknesses of the country's local self-governance and the intergovernmentalfiscal relations
system, under PRSO I,we established a "State Commission for Effective Governance and
Territorial Reform" which is chaired by the President. The mandate of the Commission is to
review the legislative basis required for consolidation of local self-governance, to propose re-
mappingof the territorial-administrative structure, to formulate a fiscal decentralizationstrategy,
and to implementan effective local governance framework.

22.     While the scope of the decentralizationreforms is broader than the PRSO program, under
the PRSO 11, we submitted a draft Law on Local Self-Government Budget to Parliament. The
draft Law was approved by Parliament in May 2006 and was published upon President's
signature This Law clarifies the rules governing intergovernmental fiscal relations, the
supporting budgetary process, including transfer mechanisms based on clear legalprovisions and
formuIa  I




23.     We believe that continuing to implement out decentralization strategy is critical for
furthering the process of improvingpublic service delivery and local self-governancein Georgia.
It will also work as a platform to continue implementation of the policy measures which are
supported by the PRSO program, including: (i)the design and adoption of a strategy for
IntergovernmentalFiscal Relations and a implementationagenda; and (ii)the implementationat
the Ministry of Finance of a monitoring system for municipal budgetingand financial reporting.

Strengthening Public Administration

24.     We are committed to improving public administration to enhance the capacity for
designing and implementing appropriate public policies and delivering adequate services to the
population. Our objective continues to be: establish a professional public sector; boost the
morale i;f civil servants; eliminate institutional sources of corruption; and optimize staff size in
line with the new functions assigned to each ministry. In this regard, our medium term agenda
has focused on: (i) elaborating civil service reform guidelines into a more comprehensive civil
service reform strategy; (ii) revising, drafting and adopting new legislation regulating civil
service to address shortcomings in the current legislation; (iii)adopting legislation to regulate
ethics and discipline for civil service staff and a motivating pay system within an agreed fiscal
framework; (iv) developing a data base to implement a Human Resources Management
Information System (HRMIS) and (v) improving the quality of the civil service by introducing
regulationsfor competitive, merit-basedrecruitment.

25.     In line with these commitments and supported by PRSO I,we amended the Civil Service
Law in order to establishthe Public Service Council (PSC) and the Public Service Bureau(PSB).
Further decrees were prepared to define the specific tasks and responsibilities of these new
structures. We have improved organizationaleffectivenessby streamlining government structures
and functions in several ministries (Education, Justice, Agriculture) and public agencies (tax and
customs administrations and traffic police) reducing civil service employment by 40,000. This
has improved efficiency and allowed us to increase salaries for the remaining staff and attract
good people to public service.

26.     With support of the PRSO program, we will continue to focus on developing and
implementing an updated governance program, which the State Commission on Government
Reforms intends to prepare. A second dimension of the civil service reform program involves
connection to other key reforms, notably in the budget process. We need information about
staffing cost and quantity to prepare a strategic budget in the context of the MTEF. The Human
Resources Management Information Database would provide a central instrument for better
managingour humanresourceswithin the context of a strategic and disciplined budget process.

27.       The medium-term implementation plan for administrative and civil service reform, pay
and incentive systems reform, reclassification of appointees has been actively discussed with the
State Minister on Reform Coordination Issues . This formed the basis of the Civil Service
Reform section of the National Anti-Corruption Strategy. Under auspices of the Public Service
Council. PSB has developed the new draft Code on Public Service, which will also include the
public servants code of ethics and conduct, address deficiencies and drawbacks of the current
Public Service Law. Supported by the PRSO 11, the PSB is developing the concept and
implementation modalities for a Human Resources Managementand Information System. Under
PRSO 111, we will make substantial steps towards improving a pay and incentive systems and
introducing career development training. Furthermore, we will identify areas for a multi-year
civil service reform program.

Enhancing Public Sector Transparency and Accountnbilify

28.    Our past anti-corruption activities include, where necessary, prosecution of high-level
officials and the successful reorganization of some key law-enforcement agencies. As initial
steps to enhance transparency and consolidation in the anti-corruption process, we created a sub-
entity at the Office of the National Security Council responsible for monitoring and evaluating
anti-corruption reforms and activities within the country.         The Anti-Corruption Policy
Department (ACPD) was entrusted with creating the working group for the elaboration of a
National Anti-Corruption Strategy, which includes civil society members. As a first step, the
ACPD produced a list of all anti-corruption activities across government.

29.    Supported by PRSO I,the Government reorganized and re-staffed the traffic police and
thereby visibly reduced corruption; establishedthe ACPD, thereby enhancingthe civic voice; and
issued, by Presidential decree, the National Anti-Corruption Strategy which introduced the
following comprehensive measures to prevent and further reduce corruption: (i)civil service
reform; (ii)strengtheningof the principles of accountability and public disclosure, including the
facilitation of public feedback mechanisms; (iii) strengthening of the rule of law; (iv)
strengtheningof the control bodies of all three branches of authority and monitoring by society;
(v) facilitation of competitive businesssector development; and (vi) national integration.

30. We have been directing our anti-corruption agendatowards addressing issues of prevention,
and mitigating opportunities for corruption in the public management processes by placing the
responsibility and accountability on line ministries limiting regulated acitvities and minimizing
discretions of civil servants.. This approach also ties anti-corruption initiatives closely to the
goals of improved efficiency and service delivery. While the ministries are taking steps to
reform their processes, curb corrupt activities and improve service delivery, we need to continue
monitoring progress in these initiatives to ensure that the delegated approach to these reforms
does not fragment the anti-corruption agenda.

31.    As a next step. Anticorruption Strategy Implementation Action Plan was drafted and
enacted. Coordination of the actions was assigned to the Office of the State Minister on Reforms
Coordination.

32. In 2005, Georgia concluded First Round Evaluation in GRECO, as well as complied with
most o f the recommendationsby OECD Anti-Corruption Network.

33.   Under the PRSO program, we have been developing a monitoring system to track progress
in curbing corruption and improving service delivery. This accountability program has four
componcnts: (i)the provision of information to citizens about what services Governmentshould
provide and what kinds of service charges can be requested; (ii) the introduction of survey-based
monitoring of service performance and informal payments at the point of service delivery; (iii)
the strengthening of particular mechanisms whereby citizens'can "voice" their concerns about
service delivery and/or corruption in the specific service delivery areas; and (iv) the publication
of an annual report showing data from the user surveys and details of complaints registered
through the new complaint mechanisms, as well as remedial actions taken.                Our ultimate
objectives are to have full transparency at the point of service of organizational budgets, service
entitlements and service fees required in key sectors (health, education, licensing, and customs).


34. The Ministry of Education and Science set up notice boards in all public schools in Tbilisi
informing citizens about organizational budgets, service entitlements and service fees required;
and initiated baseline surveys of informal paymentsat the point of service in the education sector.

35.   I.lncler the PRSO 1l:the Government has enhanced its reform steps by buildingcapacity of
monitoring point of servicecorruption in key service areas. Baselinesurveys are beingconducted
and results will soon bepublished and formally shared with public showing the extent of point of
service informal payments in the education sectors. Further, a comprehensivesurvey instrument
to measure corruption in public service is under development. An initial version is beingtested.
Morediscussions on the draft will follow as the first results of the pilot testing will be available.

Under the PRSO 111, the provision of information will expand further and monitoring will
continue. At this stage, the Government's performancein curbing informal payments at the point
of service will be transparent, enhancing accountability for the results and incentives for effective
and aggressive reform.

Pillar 11: Improving Electricity and Gas Sector Services

36. The energy sector stitl has major issues of reliability, energy security, and financial
sustainability. However, much progress was made during the last twelve months. For the first
time since independence, we have regained24 hours' electricity service for paying customers in
the regions of Georgia, thus joining Tbilisi consumers in receiving such service level.
Investments financed by the state budget and international financial institutions have supported
this positive development. The payment flows into the sector were greatly helped by better
payment enforcement and the installation of about 12,000 communal meters with up to 70
customers behind each meter as an interim solution while individual metering gradually is
expanded.       UEDC, the dominant state-owned regional power distribution utility, achieved
collection of about 75 percent in mid-2006, as compared to about 50 percent and 30 percent one
and two years earlier, respectively. Medium and low voltage power lines and equipment were

transferred from the transmissioncompany GSE to UEDC, as agreed under PRSO I,and this has
helped streamline operationsand increase the service level.

37.  The Georgian energy systeni is vulnerable to supply interruptions, particularly because
currently all of the natural gas consumption is imported from one source (Russia) and across
connections that are few in number and vulnerable to breakdowns. Therefore, the Government in
2005 focused on investments in rehabilitating domestic hydropower plants, strengtheningmajor
transanissionlines, and enhancingthe energy cooperation with Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Turkey.
Further, a new 110 MW gas turbine was installed in record time near Tbilisi, and two older
thermal power units were rehabilitated. Nevertheless. Georgia experienced hardship in January
2006 when sabotage on Russian territory caused interruption in the supply of Russian gas and
electricity to Georgia. The incident, which for more than a week left large population groups
without light and heating, strengthenedthe Government's resolve in pursuing energy security and
self-sustainability,

38,    The Government has continued into 2006 to pursue long-term solutions for Georgia's
energy problems, as described in the "Georgia Energy Sector Strategic Action Plan 2005-08"
agreed with IDA under PRSO I. The Government is privatizing power and gas sector assets
except high voltage power transmissionand dispatch. the Enguri hydropower plant, and the main
gas rransmission pipelines.     The gas distribution company Tbilgazi has been sold to the
Kazakhstan based company KazTransGas. Six hydropower plants and three power distribution
compsnies (I.JEDC. Adjara. Kakheti) have been sold through the tender bidding to a Czech based
company Energo EnergoPro (except Kakheti Distribution Company, sold to local energy group
TBC+Energy). We plan to sign a sale and purchase agreement by the end of September 2006.
New owners of generationassets will have direct sales contractswith distribution companies and
some large industrial consumers. These direct contracts together with a balancing mechanism
and financial settlement arrangements will replace today's "wholesale market" that has some
characteristics of a single buyer. We will update the Energy Sector Action Plan during PRSO I11
to reflect the revised vision of the Government for the energy sector, in line with the final
program of privatization. To facilitate the market, we will implement major components of a
modemelectricity dispatch system (SCADA).

39.   Major tariff increases for gas and electricity were introduced in 2006, in part due to large
cost increases on natural gas imported from Russia. Gas prices were increased by about 30
percent to 34-36 tetri per cubic meter in the first half of the year. In lune, electricity priceswere
raised by more than 60 percent in the regions and about 20 percent in Tbilisi to 14 and 16 tetri
(average level of mid-level tariff, including VAT) per kilowatt-hour, respectively. Unfortunate
as such major tariff increases are, they were necessary in order to bring the energy sector to
financial and technical sustainability and to pay for importedenergy, while dramaticallyreducing
the drain on public finances. Impact on the poor will be mitigated by special tariff mechanisms
and direct financial support. So-called step tariffs have been introduced for electricity where
increasing consumption causes higher tariffs. A review of the Georgian tariff methodology by
international consultants has found the methodology generally sound and in accordance with
good international practice. In parallel, we are focusing on more timely and comprehensive
monitoring and reporting ofelectricity service.

40.    The accumulated debt in the electricity sector amounted to approximately GEL 1.3 billion
at the end of 2004. most of which is intra-statedebt including tax arrears, and about GEL 320
million is debt to the private sector and employees. This legacy debt is clearly unbearable for the
sector, as demonstrated by bankruptcy protection obtained by several companies, including
UEDC and transmission company GSE. In this context, the legislative reforms in the sector
implemented in the summer of 2006, including the draft Debt Management Law submitted to
Parliamcnt for approval. and new enzrgy policy is designed to cut the augmentation of the
problem and tackle the issue gradually within next eighteen months. This process is taking place
in parallel with privatization in the power sector. While the government is selling assets (rather
than companies) free of debt, it will also shield investors from potential creditor claims through
indemnification arrangements.    .

41.   The Government is also addressing issues in the oil and gas sectors.            To improve
management and enable better implementationof sector goals, the Government has placed three
state energy companies, Georgian International Oil Company (GIOC),                 Georgian Gas
International Company (GGIC), and National Oil Company (Saknavtobi), under a holding
company: Georgian Oil and Gas Company (GOGC). The companies will later be merged into
GOGC. GOGC will have a gas transportation company as a subsidiary, and this company will
provide gas to Georgia from various soiirces including transit fee gas from Russia, and gas from
the Azerbaijan Shah Deniz field that will start to flow through the new South Caucasus Pipeline
in the :id1 of 2006. InAdition, and in larger amounts, gas distribution companies and major
industrial consumers will arrange for direct gas import contracts with Russian and potentially
other suppliers. Since the Shah Deniz gas is substantially less expensive than Russian gas (but
also less flexible with respect to supply profile), the Government will ensure that as much Shah
Deniz gas as possible will enter the Georgian market. Arrangements for onsale of the Shah
Deniz gas to consumers have still to be agreed in detail. Under existing contracts, Georgia
expects to receive about 50 million m3of Shah Deniz gas in 2006 and 200 million. m' in 7007,
reachinga top level of 825 million m3in 2011. Georgiaconsumed I.5 billion m3of gas in 200.5.

42.    Georgia's gas supplies are technically and financially vulnerable, as evidenced by the
sabotage on Russian gas supply lines to Georgiain January 2006, and by the increase in Russian
gas prices from around US$60 per 1000 m3to US$ I10 per 1000 m3as of January 1.2006. To
mitigate the technical risk, we reached an agreement with the US. Millennium Challenge
Corporation in 2005 for a US$ 49 million grant to rehabilitate the north-south transit gas
pipeline. and implementation work is currently ongoing. Additional carbon trade financing is
sought. To mitigate also the financial risk, the Government is pursuing alternative supply
sources, notably Azerbaijan, while also promoting exploration for domestic gas.               The
Government is cognizant of the risk of further major price increases on natural gas in the near
future, and will in the coming months study the implicatioiis of such development and possible
mitigating actions. For the longer term, increased use of domestic energy sources will be
essential, and the Government appreciates the ongoing cooperation with IDA on the possible
developmentofthe 640 M W Khudoni hydropowerpro-iect.


Pillar 111: Improving Environment for PrivateSector Development

43. Developmentof the private sector is a key priority for Georgia, to generate employmentand
reduce poverty. In this context, we have continued implementing reforms to further improvethe
investment environment and business climate, including passing the legislations on inspection
and licensing, amendments to the new Tax Code, adoption of the new Labor Code, liberalization
of in!port tariffs, and improvement in the governance of public sector. We intend to continue
wirh diese rel`ormsto further reduce the constraintsto private sector growth.

44.    To improve permits and licensing requirements, under PRSO I,we adopted the new law
aimed at liberalizing the permit and licensing system and reducingtheir number to the minimum
by almost 85%. Creating of one-stop shop for license and permit applications and adopting the
principle of "silence is consent" should be noted separately as important reforms introduced.
Moreover, we made amendments to the Law on Entrepreneurship, which were approved by
Parliament, simplifying registrationprocess and moving it out of courts and placing it inthe Tax
Department. We will implement the new standardized business licensing and permit procedures
through the institutional capacity building, training and other options. Under PRSO 11, we have
significantly simplified the inspection procedures and are in the process of publishing detailed
rights and responsibilities of businesses and inspectors in the inspection process to ensure that
these are accessible to both inspectorsand private sector. We adopted new regulations in April
2006 bliich havereduced businessregistrationtime.

45.    `To improve customs and bordcr processing, :he new Customs Code was adopted by
Parlianient. The new Customs Code entering into force from January Is'2007 significantly
simplifies customs requirements.. We are currently developing the necessary regulations for
implementationof the new Customs Code in collaboration with the private sector.

46.    Adoption of the new Law on Customs Tariffs in July 2006 means that Georgia has one of
the most liberalized and competitive trade regimes in the world. Namely, there are 3 tariff rates
(0, 5, and 12percent) instead ofthe previously existing 16. Import tariffs are abolished on almost
90 percent oftariff lines. The new law came into force September lS1,  2006.

47.     The new Labor Code, aiming at liberalization of labor relations, was elaborated and
adopted by the Parliament of Georgia. The new code, effective since June 2006, envisages less
intervention from the state in employer-employee relations. The priority is given to conditions
agreed in the labor contract, while hiring and firing costs are reduced essentially. Among the
novelties introduced by the new code, no minimal wage and no fixed overtime costs should be
mentioned.

48.    Under PRSO I,a comprehensive reform of standardization and accreditationwas launched
to ensure approxiination of these systems to the international bestpractices, to comply with WTO

CIS markets. The reform was underpinned by legislative changes - the new laws on (i)
requirementsand to promote exports, especially to facilitate access of Georgian productsto non-

Standardization; (ii)Integrity of Meawements; and jiii) Certification of Goods and Services
have been adopted. The above-mentionedlawscame into force from July 2005.

49.    Under PRSO 11, we have started to implement these legislative changes. First we have
reorganized the standardization agency. which eventually has been split into two independent
agencies - the Natiorial Agency for Standardization and Metrology and the National Agency for
Accreditation. As a result of these reforms, the institutional and structiiral arrangements of
standardization and accreditation have been optimized and systems of accreditation, quality
assurancc and management, standardizationand technical regulations which are consistent with
internatinrial standards have been intioduced. Standardization system has become flexible by
shifting iiom mandatory to voluntary standards. In February 2006, the Government issued a
decree accepting the technical regulation's o f OECD and some other countries (total of 36
countries). We are committed to conform Georgia's regulations to those of the WTO and
internationallyacceptedprinciplesof accreditationand standardization

50.    Stringent international food safety standards, globalization, international trade, increased
consumer demand for safer and healthier foods, and efforts being made to liberalize and
deregulate the national economy have forced the Government to rethink the organization and
structure of its food safety system. As a consequence, a reform effort was initiated two years
ago, the first step of which to debate among food safety professionals, consumers, industry and
policy makersthe desired organizationalstructure for a new food control system.

5 1.  This dcbate resulted in the new "Law on Food Safety and Quality", which was adopted in
Decemhcr 2005. The new law establishes a legal framework consistentwith WTO requirements
and the L U ucquis cornmunaufaire, establishes a single inspection body (theNational Service for
Food Safety. Veterinary and Plant Protection Service) for the enforcement of technical food
regulations. and elaborates the broad principles, objectives and responsibilities for food safety.
The new law is expected to improve the business environment for the food industry by setting a
fair and level playing field in terms of compliance, improved confidence in the inspections
system and improved access to international markets. The charter of the new Food Safety,
Veterinary and Piant Protection Service was developed in February 2006 and staffing has been
completed through the nationwide competition throughout the whole country. Almost all
secondary legislation has been adopted, which means that legal basis for exercising full state
control over food safety and quality is already in place. The Service will have the sole
responsibility for food safety, excluding border control, which was transferred to the Customs
Department ofthe Minist? of Finance.

52.    We progressed with privatizing State-Owned Enterprises in order to achieve sustainable .
growth through private sector development.The mosl active phase of the privatization process,
which started in 2004, will be finished in 2006. In 2004-2005 the Governinent of Georgia
received US$ 270.5 niillion from the privatization process, exceeding the privatization inconies
of 2000-2003 by almost nine times. In 2006 large enterprises operating in energy generation and
distribution, and telecommunication have been already privatized. To promote an efficient
privatization process we utilize various methods such as tender. auction, conditional auction,
lease and redemption, and direct sale. To ensure a high degree o f fairness and transparency, we
work actively towards establishing international contacts with interested organizations and
potential investors. Until 2005, 75 percent o f agriculture land and 2.5 millioii hectares of forests
was under state-ownership.In 2005, the law on privatization of state-owned agricultural land was

passed in order to promote efficient use of land through private ownership and increased
efficiency in the agricultural sector. We enacted the Law on Licenses and Permits, which inter
alia covers licenses for the use of natural resource. Privatization o f state-ownedagricultural land
is in progress, gaining additional momentum. Forests and other natural resources will more
actively betransferred to private hands under long-termtradable licenses in 2007


PillarIV: Improving Social Protection, Education, and Health Care Services

Social Protection

53.     Our objective is to provide adequate poverty alleviation to the neediest population o f
Georgia, We have taken important measures that resulted in timely payment of pensions and
other social transfers. We have cleared more than 85 percent ofthe arrears in the pension system
and will clear the rest by end-2006. In addition, as of January 2005. we doubled and in
September of 2006 will further increase the pensions. In the medium-term, within the overall
availability of resources, we will continue the efforts to strengthen the targeting of social
assistance benefits to the extreme poor. To that end, we have introduced a target social
assistanceprogram which provides acash benefit to the extremepoor and is expected to alleviate
poverty morc effectively than the existing programs. The task of developing and implementing
the benefit is beingcarried out by the Ministry of Labor, Health and Social Affairs.

54.    To start paying the benefit to our target population, the extreme poor households, we
completed (i) development of the targeting formula; (ii)development and issuanceof documents,
including an operating manual for the benefit administration; (iii) establishment of the
Employment and Social Services Agency that is the administration agency for benefit; (iv) the
recruitment and training of the Agency's staff; and (v) computerization o f the applicants and
beneficiariesdata bases at the district level, includingsoftware development. We created a data-
base on vulnerable families in Georgia from the collection and computerization of information
on applicant households.      We already received applications from 400,000 households and
processed 300,000 (corresponding to 36 percent and 27 percent of population). We intend to
update this data-base regularly and use it to target not only the cash poverty benefit, but also
other social programs. According to database, from June 2006 the electricity subsidy was
provided to 280,000 poor households and from July 2006 new healthcare program was
introduced which is providing additional medical services for 220,000 poor households. We
started cash benefit program for extreme poor households from August 2006 in Tbilisi and from
September 2006 the program is extended throughout the country. More than 80,000 households
are beneficiariesfrom September and until the end of 2006 the number will gradually increase to
up to 130,000 households.

55.    Once we start the nationwide payment of the targeted poverty benefit in cash, we will
closely monitor and evaluate its performance. We will use the monitoring and evaluation
findings to improve both the targetingmechanism and the benefit's administration arrangements.
In parallel, we will analyze reform options in order to introduce an optimal system that would

provide protection against poverty in old age, as well as offers opportunities for voluntary private
contractual savings.

Education

56.      We have taken significant steps to re-shape our education system and to address its key
isscies through new legislation at general and higher education levels, while the new law on
vocdticinal education is already publicircd for discussions. At the school level, all Georgian
schools gained a high level of autonomy, being registered as public law entities. This made it
possible to change to per capita financing to ensure improved use o f education funding and to
reward quality at school level. Special importance is given to monitoring both the quality and
financial accountability o f the decentralized school system.

57.    In addition to decentralization of the responsibility for financing and management, also the
responsibility for quality has been decentralized to schools through new management structures
at school level. These include school boards that have been elected in all Georgian schools in
June 2006 and already within the next few months the school boards will elect new school
principals. A new system o f local governance is being introduced in General Education.
Educational Resource Centers wil I be facilitating, rather than administrating schools on the
district level. At higher education level. changes in management and programs have been started
withiit :he tic*   law requirements. ?'he first institutional accreditation o f higher educational
~nsti!.ii.ionshas been conducted, and quality control is being strengthened within the universities.

58. The IDA funded Education Strengthening and Realignment Project has supported both these
exciting policy changes as well as changes in the areas of quality control and assessment,
curriculum and teacher training. At the upper levels, the first unified university examinations to
ensure improved transparency in the administration of examinations took place under PRSO I.
For these reasons: the autonomous National Assessment and Examination Center (N.4EC) was
established under the Ministry of Education and Science and currently also national centers for
school curricdum and assessment, accreditation, teacher developmanr are established as
autonomous entities under the Ministry.

59.     Under PRSO I1 we achieved good progress in developing the concept o f a broad Quality
Assurance system to monitor educational quality across the span o f general and higher education
through examinations. national and international assessments as we1Ias school level assessments
and institutional and program accreditation procedures. A new system of school accreditation
will link indicators of school improvement to national level indicators o f educational progress. In
order to improve policy preparation and efficient use o f human and physical resources: we also
focus on strengthening our policy and management capacity, amongst others by using data
collected by the newly created statistical unit of the Ministry.

60.    PRSO I1 supported our work to enable Georgia participating fully in the ongoing TIMSS
and PIRLs international testing which will for the first time benchmark academic attainment o f
Georgian students at the international level. Large programs on school building rehabilitation and
computerization have been started for all state schools under the state budget support. The next

process started under the educational reform policy is realigpment of the vocational education
system which aims to make youngsters and adults able to join the labor market as qualified
workers.    The practical implementation of new VET strategy and full reorganization of
vocational education centers is already started.

61.     We are improving expenditure efficiencies given the budgetary constraints and heavy
capital costs for infrastructure and salaries. The Government has supported and intends to
conhiue supporting the ongoing education reforms through increasing the education budget so
that new systemic reforms are sustainable.Large projects of school computerization and school
building rehabilitation have been started under the Government support. These program changes
are being consolidated into a coasted education strategy consistent with the MTEF and allow
maximization of available donor and government finance to support long term education sector
reforms and monitorableoutcomes.

Health Care

62.    We have focused on addressing the shortcomings in the health sector and are planningto
increase public funding to this sector. To tackle the most urgent issues affecting the sector we
have reviewed and revised the essential package of services which should be funded fully by the
public sectoi. First. \ye pian to incrwse public funding to the health sector starting from year
200:' and the 2007-2010 MTEF will adequately reflect this increase. Starting from year 2006 we
have allocatcd increased resources for the above, including additional funding of GEL 18 million
for the poor. Second, we will develop short and medium term strategy to address the priority
issues affecting the sector. We have established a special commission, represented by key
ministry departments and Health Policy Unit (HPU). The commission is actively working to
prioritize strategic directions of the reforms to adequately reflect these strategies and actions in
the MTEFdocument, and is developing implementationplan and monitoringtools.

63.    Third. we will improve the allocutive and technical efl7ciency of the resources by adopting
a revisedbasic benefit package (BBP). The BBP is composed of a universal package applicable
to the whole population and a supplemental package applicable to the poor. The universal
package has been piloted in the renovated Primary Health Care facilities in Ajara and Imereti.
The supplemental package is planned to be budgeted and implemented at the national level in
2007.    In order to ensure that preventive and essential healthcare services are adequately
financed, expenditures on health care will primarily be allocated to preventive services, primary
health care and emergency care. To tackle the widespread informal payments in the sector, we
will adopt measuresto improve public awarenesson the eligible free of charge services as well as
on the services, which require official co-payments and or should be paid by the patient. Special
emphasis will be given to the redesignof the purchasing and payment mechanisms.

64.    Fourth, improving the governunce arid efecfiveness of the health care delivag! system is
essential. Our aim is to shift the orientation of the healthcare system towards preventive and
primary health care and realign and structure secondary and tertiary levels of care to support
primary care through a functional referral scheme          Our mediuni term priority is to: (i)
rehabilitate, renovate and upgrade PHC facilities and equipment and retrain staff. particularly in

the most remote areas of the country; (ii) finalize the hospital master pian and initiate its
implementation by clarifying the assignment of responsibilities for public or private ownership,
management and financing; and (iii) prepare a health sector labor strategy for longer term
adjustment in the number, mix and distribution of needed medical skills and competencies.
Fifth, we believe that the establishment of a system of licensing of; and quality conlrol and
assurance in, health facilities and certification and licensing of health professionals is required
to achieve our objectives in the health sector. Finally, we will develop apharrnaceuticalspolicy
for a more rational use of drugs in line with MOHLSA's increased responsibility in overall
system governance.

Conclusion

65.    We have made important progress in implementing Georgia's reform program which has
been supported by the First and Second PRSO. We are encouraged by the results in curbing
corruption, improving the business climate and beginningto improve delivery of public services.
In the coming years the challenge is to maintain the reform momentum, particularly on
governance issues. while ensuringboth the quality and intendedimpact of these reforms. We are
committed to making fiirther progress in combating corruption, the difficult work of steadily
improving the functioning o fthe public sector, strengthening the business climate, and improving
the delivery of social and infrastructureservices. These are critical to realizing Georgia's growth
potential and reducingpoverty. At the end of the periodo f the PRSO program, we are confident
that the Georgian economy will be firmly placed on a sustainable growth and poverty reduction
path.

Background

1.      Over the last decade,Georgia's externalpublic and publicly guaranteed(PPG)
debt burdenhasfallen frommorethan 80 percentof GDPto less than 30 percent.
Heavy borrowing for energy imports inthe initial years after independence account for the
rapid build-up o f external PPG debt. The stock exceeded $1 billion by the end o f 1995.
Owing to robust growth, the debt-to-GDPratio declined to below 50 percent in 1996-98,
before the sharp depreciation o fthe lari against the U.S. dollar duringthe Russia crisis wiped
out some o f this gain. The debt-to-GDP ratio has again beendeclining since then. The pace
increased after the Rose revolution as a result o f strong growth, restrainedborrowing and fast
repayment o f energy debt to Turkmenistan.

contrast, the share o fmultilateral creditors increased from under 5 percent in 1994 to more

3.       The recent positive developments need to be sustained to avoid the debt legacy of
the past. External debt service payments reached about 70 percent o f exports o f goods and
services in 1995. The very low levels o f fiscal revenues excluding grants at less than
13 percent o f GDP for much o fthe 1990smade servicing external debt particularly
problematic. As a result, a series o frescheduling agreements since 1995 were concluded3*,
but arrears continued to accumulate through 2004, including on the rescheduled debt. In
contrast to the past, today external debt service payments amount to 13 percent o f exports (on
an accrual basis). Fiscal non-grant revenues on the order o f 24 percent o f GDP have easedthe
fiscal financing constraint on debt servicing as well.

4.       From a peak of 17 percent of GDP in 2000, the stock of domestic PPGdebt
steadily declined to about 10 percent at end-2005. This amounts to about 26 percent o f
total general government debt at the time. Debtto the National Bank o f Georgia (NBG)
accounted for about 75 percent o f this amount. The remaining amount o f domestic general
government liabilities were mostly expenditure arrears. Interms o f domestic debt andbond
issues, the medium term strategy o f Georgia i s to gradually replace the NBG debt with
government securities.

5.       Public debt for the purpose of this DSA is defined narrowly on a gross basis and
excludes debt owed by (formerly) state-owned enterprises, especially in the energy
sector. Serious data issues hamperthe analysis o f SOE debt. Moreover, large debt write-offs
and other forms o f debt settlement are expected inthe near future inthe context o fthe
privatization o f state-owned enterprises and rehabilitation o f the energy sector. This DSA

rescheduling on Houston terms in2001. A debt treatment under the Evian approach was granted in2004, which
includes a goodwill clause to reconsider Georgia's debt situation at the end o f the current agreement. Bilateral
agreementson terms comparable to the 2004 Paris Club flow rescheduling are inplace with all non-Paris Club
creditors except Kazakhstan.

   also excludes contingent liabilities from the Soviet era, including deposits at the former state
   savings bank. Amounts outstanding andthe terms o f their treatment (ifany) are very
   uncertain. External debt excludes private sector debt for lack o f data. The outstanding stock i s
   thought to be small. However, commercial bank data suggest that these liabilities could be
   growing fast. The authorities are therefore encouraged to continue their efforts to collect
   more systematically data on private bank and non-bank indebtedness abroad.

   6.        Georgia's debt distressrisk is             The baseline scenario indicates that the risk o f
   debt distress is low, and remains so throughout the projectionperiod. All external debt
   indicators are well below the relevant debt-burden thresholds. However, some debt indicators
   remain vulnerable to stress testing o f key variables.

   7.        Under the baseline scenario (Box 1)' debt ratios remain on a downward trend
   (Table l a and Figure la). Public debt falls from about 36 percent o f GDP at end-2005 to
   20 percent at end-2010 and continues to decline thereafter. Innet present value (NPV) terms,
   public debt at about 137 percent ofrevenues is expected to fall by 60 percent before the end
   o f the decade. The debt service-to-revenue ratio is estimated to improve from 17 percent o f
   fiscal non-grant revenues inthe base year to 5 percent in2010.

   8.        Official external debt indicators also fall steadily under the baseline scenario
   with debt ratios continuing to shrink gradually (Table l b and Figure lb). Georgia's
   external public debt stood at about 27 percent o f GDP at end-2005, equivalent to 92 percent
   o f exports inNPV terms. Debt service ratios are also comfortably below the relevant
   thresholds for a strong policy performer.

   improvement inthe policy and institutionalperformance.

9.       Alternativescenarios andboundtests are constructedto examinethe sensitivity
of the baselineprojection of PPGdebt to a range of potentialshocks (Tables2a and2b).
Most of these factors would not jeopardize Georgia's debt sustainability. The main exception
is a temporary decline o f export value growth for two years to one standard deviation below
historical averages. Inthis case, the NPV o f debt-to-exports ratio would rapidly increase in
the mediumterm, even ifthe gap were financed at better than commercial terms (30 percent
grant element). This outcome does not bode well inlight o f recent trade developments.
Export volumes o f scrap metal, Georgia's main export commodity, are dwindlingwhile
Russia imposed import bans on Georgianwine, mineral water, tea, and citrus fruits. With
official reserves relatively low (at about 3 months o f imports), this could erode hard gained
exchange rate stability.

                      Box 1. Georgia: Macroeconomic Assumptions Underlying the DSA

A baseline macroeconomic framework similar to the ones used inprevious exercises also underpins this DSA:

Real GDP growth i s estimatedto be 7.5 percent in2006 before gradually falling to a projected 5 percent in
2009 and 4 percent in2016 as Georgia progresses toward a higher income level. Long-run equilibrium growth i s
assumed to be sustained at 3.5 percent after 2019.

Inflation is assumed to fall from a projected 10percent in2006 to 5 percent by 2008. A flirther decline to
4 percent during 2011-1 5 and 3 percent thereafter i s assumed, keepingpace with overall macroeconomic
improvement. The real exchange rate relative to the dollar i s assumed to appreciate at almost 3 percent per
year in2006-15, when substantial foreign capital is expected to flow into Georgia ina fast growing period.
After 2015, the real exchange rate is assumed to appreciate at a much slower pace-less       than one percent per
year.

Export growth i s projected to average more than 13 percent over 2006-10, before declining to about 6 percent
for the remainder o f the projection period. Import growth i s expected to average close to 13 percent over
2006-10, before converging to 6 percent for the remainder o f the projectionperiod.

Somewhat different than earlier exercises, the average external current account deficit is forecast to remain
above 7 percent o f GDP for most o f 2006-10 and would converge to 5 percent o f GDP on average during the
remainder o f the projection period to support a faster modernization o f the Georgian economy than previously
assumed.

Regarding fiscal policy, the authorities are expected to buildon the recent success o f their tax and governance
reforms. Tax revenues are projectedto amount to about 22 percent o f GDP in2006, gradually improving to a
long-run level o f about 23 percent. Government spending is expected to remain stable at around 25 percent o f
GDP. As a result, the overall deficit would fall from less 1.8 percent o f GDP in 2006-09 to less than 1.1percent
in2010-16, followed by abalancedbudget.

Small financing gaps are filled with new public borrowing largely o n concessional terms. The bulk o f the
financing o f the external current account deficit will be private both o n the creditor and debtor side, as expected
for a country inGeorgia's per capita income group.


10.      A temporarywidening of the annualcurrentaccountdeficit(by 5 percentage
pointsof GDP each year in2007-09) wouldnot leadto key debt indicatorsbreaching
indicativethresholds.Such a scenario would only havetemporary effects on the debt stock
ratios through the mediumterm. However, debt service relative to exports would be


                                                         88

permanently higher compared to the baseline. The assumed current account deterioration
could be the result o f a further deterioration o f economic relations with Russiaresultingina
sharp increase inthe price o f gas from Russia before Georgia can access alternative sources
and/or a temporary disruption o fremittance inflows before alternative money transfer
channels are found. Restricted access to concessional credit will have permanent effects on
NPV ratios (Table 2b, scenario A2).Ifthe decline inconcessionalityo fthe new borrowing
assumed inthe baseline i s limitedto a 2-percentage point higher interest rate, however, key
ratios do not breach indicative thresholds over the projection period.

11.     The main risk to fiscal debt sustainability would be a decline in GDP growth.
The NPV o f debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to 30 percent inthe long runinthe case o f
permanent slow down o f GDP growth. This permanent shock to real GDP growth would also
pushthe NPV o f debt-to-revenues ratio to 128percent by 2026. Against this background, the
authorities should continue to strengthen competitiveness o f their tradable sector and improve
the business climate to support baseline growth.

                       Partnershipin Georgia'sDevelopmentStrategy

1.     The Government has prepared a Progress Report o f its PRSP-or the Economic
Development and Poverty ReductionProgram (EDPRP) as it i s known inGeorgia. A Joint Staff
Advisory Note together with the Progress Report on the EDPRP was sent to the Boards o f IDA
and the IMF in September 2006. The IMF completed the fourth review under the PRGF
arrangement in September 2006.        On September 15, 2005, IDA endorsed a new Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY06-09, and approved the first in a program o f three Poverty
Reduction Support Operations (PRSOs).

2. .   The Fundhas taken the lead in assisting Georgia in improving macroeconomic stability
and pursuing fiscal reforms. The World Bank has taken the lead in the policy dialogue on
structural issues, focusing on: (i)strengthening public expenditure management; (ii)     improving
performance o f the public sector; (iii)reducing corruption; (iv) deepening and diversifying
sources o f growth; (v) protecting the environment; and (vi) reducing poverty. Georgia i s one o f
the largest IDA borrowers inthe CIS, with borrowing of US$816 million for 40 operations. The
PRSO has supported further elaboration and implementation o f the key elements o f the
Government's poverty reduction strategy as described in the EDPRP and Progress Report. The
PRSO program i s.built on four pillars: (i) strengthening public sector accountability, efficiency,
and transparency; (ii)improving electricity and gas sector services; (iii)improving the
environment for private sector development; and (iv) improving social protection, education and
health care services. Other support has come in the form of project support and Analytic and
Advisory Activities across a broad spectrum o f areas including education, health care, social
protection, energy, roads, water and sanitation, agriculture, agricultural research and extension,
irrigation and drainage, forestry, environment, biodiversity, enterprise development, municipal
development, judicial reform, and cultural heritage. A Public Expenditure Review (PER) was
prepared in 2002, and a Trade Study in 2003. The PER i s being followed by a series o f annual
programmatic PERs, the first of which i s under preparation. A Country Procurement
Assessment Report (CPAR) was prepared in 2002 and a Country Financial Accountability
Assessment (CFAA) in 2003. Updates o f these are scheduled for FY06. A series of annual
programmatic Poverty Assessments are being implemented

3.     Georgia became a shareholder and a member o f IFC in 1995. As of January 1, 2006, IFC
has invested around $137 million to finance projects in the financial, power, oil and gas, and
manufacturing sectors. IFC continues to explore the investment opportunities in partnership
with strategic investors in both the financial and real sectors o f the country.    Inthe financial
sector, IFC has focused on supporting the development o f the housing finance market, providing
credit lines and technical assistance to the leading banks - the Bank o f Georgia and TBC Bank.
To reach small and medium enterprises, IFC helped to establish Procredit Bank o f Georgia, the
country's first bank specializing in lending to micro and small enterprises. Most recently, IFC
has provided a credit line to TBC Leasing to support the rapid growth o f their portfolio o f SME
clients; this project grows out o f two year's o f technical assistance to the Government and
private sector to support the growth o f the leasing sector. Inoil transit, IFC has provided equity
and credit to local and international companies, including investments by BritishPetroleum and
other sponsors in the construction o f the Baku-Supsa Early Oil Pipeline and the Baku-Tbilisi-
Ceyhan Pipeline. Other investmentprojects have been in electricity distribution (AES-Telasi),

                                                96

mineral water (GGMW), and glass bottle production (Ksani Glass Factory).             IFC has also
provided donor-supported technical assistance to strengthen its client banks, introduce new
financial products (including leasing and housing finance), support public-private partnerships
in the energy sector, and to improve the business climate and corporate governance practices.
The Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), a joint facility o f IFC and the World Bank,
carried out an Assessment o f Administrative Procedures for Doing Business in 2003. FIAS
finalized an advisory project in July 2004 to assist the Government in its efforts to remove
administrative obstacles to investment to improve the business environment for private
businesses, and the Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP) did an extensive study o f the barriers to
SMEs, finalized in early 2005. PEP and FIAS are currently holding joint consultations with the
Government to identify concrete steps to be taken for improvements to the business
environment.

4.     Table 1 summarizes the division o f responsibilities between the two institutions. In a
number o f areas-for        example, the social sectors, rural development,           environment,
infrastructure, and judicial reform-the    Bank takes the lead in the dialogue and there is no
related conditionality in the IMF-supported program. The Bank is also leading the dialogue on
private sector development and energy, and Bank analysis serves as inputs into the Fund
program. Inother areas-the     financial sector, public expenditure management, and civil service
reform-both     institutions have worked together. Finally, in areas like monetary policy and
domestic customs revenue, the IMFtakes the lead.

5.     Inthe social sectors, IDA updates Georgia's Poverty Assessment based on quarterly
household survey data. IDA'Sfocus has been to improve execution o f budgetary expenditures
for health, education and poverty benefits and to raise the efficiency in the use o f scarce public
resources. Through the Social Investment Fund credits, IDA i s focusing in particular on areas
with high poverty levels to provide basic infrastructure to the poorest communities. Through
the PRSO program, IDA i s strengthening the dialogue with the Government on social protection
reform (safety nets, pensions, poverty benefits, labor market institutions and policies).

6.     In education, the Adaptable Program Credit addresses a broad spectrum o f educational
reform issues, aimed at improving learning outcomes o fprimary and secondary students through
curriculum reform, development o f a national assessment and examination system, training o f
teachers, provision o f learning materials, and development o f capacity to make better use o f
physical, financial, and human resources. It also tackles key financing issues through the
introduction o f a per capita based formula for financing basic education. While the investment
needs o f school buildings are substantially higher than is currently affordable, the Social
Investment Fund projects continue to assist in financing urgent repairs to school facilities in
many communities.         The PRSO program i s supporting the Government's               efforts in
institutionalizing systemic changes initiated with its education reform strategy.

7.     In health, IDA credits support the government in improving health care financing,
exploring risk-pooling options, introducing a new system o f primary health care, and improving
the focus o f publicly-funded services to the poor and on priority public health interventions.

SAC IIIand the SRS Credit have supported hospital restructuring. In addition, IDA will be
engaged inpolicy work inhealth sector reform inthe context o f the Medium-Term Expenditure
Framework (MTEF) and the PRSOprogram.

8.     Ininfrastructure, support is being provided through the Secondary and Local Roads
Project, the Municipal Development and Decentralization Project I1and the Social Investment
FundProject. These projects provide financing at the community level for critical infrastructure
needs, primarily for school and health facility heating and repair, small hydropower schemes to
provide electricity, drinking water and sanitation rehabilitation, as well as transportation
infrastructure rehabilitation. IFC supported the privatization of Tbilisi electricity distribution
through an investment in AES-Telasi, and IFC Advisory Services advised the Government on
the management contract for UEDC.             The recently approved Infrastructure Pre-Investment
Facility project i s to facilitate infrastructure investments of strategic importance and/or special
complexity by providing technical assistance to assess the feasibility and effectiveness o f
investments, focusing on energy and transport sectors,

9.     Inruraldevelopment,IDAcredits havesupporteddevelopmentofprivatesector farming
and ago-processing improvements, agricultural credit, irrigation and drainage, and agricultural

credit unions and water users associations. A recently approved Rural Development Project i s
to develop the productivity and profitability o f the private agriculture sector with the aim to
increase incomes and employment and reduce poverty inrural areas

10.    A recently closed JudicialReformProject provided funds for development o fnew court
administration and case management procedures, rehabilitation and construction o f courthouses,
a computerized network system, assistance for judicial training, and an extensive public
information and education outreach effort to inform citizens o f their rights and communicate the
Government's reform efforts.

Areas inwhichthe WorldBankleadsandits analysisserves as input intothe IMFprogram

11.    The Bank leads the dialogue on structural reforms through the PRSO program.
Institution buildingand technical assistance have been supported through the Structural Reform
Support Project. The Bank also leads inthe areas o f

a)     Private Sector Development. The PRSO program focuses on improving investment
       climate and reducing constraints to private sector development in Georgia. IDA has also
       been supporting private sector participation inother areas, such as energy, urban services
       and agriculture.     The IMF has worked with the authorities to initiate audits o f the
       accounts o fthree major state-owned enterprises.

b)     Energy.The energy system is inpoor condition, with unreliable supply and unsustainable
       debts. However, under the PRSO program, the Georgian authorities have made progress
       and payment collections and service levels have improved substantially in the power
       sector.  The Government o f Georgia has been working with IDA and other donors,
       including the Fund, to introduce more private management and ownership, and to
       implement a series o f short-term action plans and longer-term steps to improve the
       overall functioning o f the sector. IDA has also provided additional funding to the power

                                                   98

      sector in 2004. The Fundhas been focusing on reducing quasi-fiscal losses in the sector,
      especially through improved bill collections, while the pursuit o f tariff policies at cost-
      recovery levels was facilitated by a Bank-assisted review o f the tariffpolicy methodology.
      The Georgian authorities prepared the Energy Sector Strategic Action Plan for 2005-08
      which i s being implemented and updated periodically under the PRSO program. Ina new
      operation, the Bank will finance a feasibility study for a major, new hydropower plant
      that could add about 20 percent to the country's hydropower capacity.

c)    Public Sector Management. The PRSO program supports, inter alia, improvements in
      public expenditure management and strengthening             financial accountability and
      administrative and civil service reform. The recently approved Public Sector Financial
      Management Reform Support Project is to provide technical assistance and capacity
      buildinginthe first three areas. The Fundis providing technical assistance in support o f
      tax and customs administration reform.

d)    Municipal Finance: The Municipal Development and Decentralization Project I1has
      been assisting the Government to review the current intergovernmental fiscal relation,
      and to suggest an equalization transfer system to compensate for horizontal fiscal
      disparities across local governments.

Areas of sharedresponsibility

 12.  The Bank and the Fundhave been working jointly inthe following main areas:

a)    Poverty Reduction Strategy. Both institutions worked closely with the Government to
      support the development o f the PRSP (or EDPRP as it is known in Georgia), through
      seminars and workshops, direct staff input, and donor coordination. A JSAN and the
      Government's PRSOprogress Report of 2006 are being sent to the Board concurrently.

b)    Budget Planning and Execution. The annual programmatic Public Expenditure
      Reviews and the PRSO program will provide the underpinnings for systemic changes in
      expenditure management, development o f an MTEF, and improvements in financial
      accountability. The Public Sector Financial Management Reform Support Project will
      finance technical assistance and necessary investment to support budget planning and
      management processes within the M o F and line ministries and to support introduction o f
      an integrated public financial management system. The Fund is focusing on treasury
      reform within the Ministryo f Finance.

c)    Financial Sector Reforms. The joint Financial Sector Assessment Program has
      supported: (i)strengthened banking and non-banking supervision; (ii)        introduction o f
      international accounting standards; (iii) consolidation of banks through higher capital
      requirement ratios; (iv) anti money-laundering legislation; (v) strengthening the
      regulatory environment and removing impediments for development o f viable non- bank
      financial institutions; and (vi) strengthening the payment system. IFC has worked to
      strengthen the banking sector through investment and technical assistance, and has
      supported the development o f the financial leasing market through technical assistance.
      The Fund has focused on banking supervision, anti-money laundering legislation, and



                                              99

      improvements in monetary control instrumentswith extensive technical assistance from
      its Monetary and Financial Systems Department.

Areas inwhich the IMFleadsand its analysis serves as inputintothe World Bankprogram

a)    Fiscal Framework and reforms in tax policy and tax and customs administration.
      The Fund's focus on prudent fiscal policy has served as an important framework for
      IDA'Swork on public expenditure management. The Fund's Fiscal Affairs Department is
      now taking the leadinthe areas o f tax policy and tax and customs administration reform.

b)    Economic Statistics. IMF technical assistance has been conducive to improvements in
      national accounts, price, monetary and government financial statistics. The Bank's grant
       on Statistical Capacity Building will build on the recommendations o f Fund TA to
       strengthenthe quality o fnational accounts statistics.

Areas inwhich the IMFleadsand there is no directWorld Bankinvolvement

a)     Monetary Framework. The IMF collaborates closely with the NBG in the design and
       implementation o f a monetary program that aims at rebuilding international reserves
       while keepinginflation low and remonetizing the economy.

                                 World Bank Group Strategy

 13.   On September 15, 2005, the World Bank Executive Board endorsed the new Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY06-09 designed to assist Georgia with deeper institutional
reform as well as more fundamental infrastructure improvements.        The CPS builds on the
EDPRP, as well as emerging Government strategic thinking on the developmentframework. In
doing so, it targets several goals: (i) Generating growth andjob creation by removing barriers
to private sector development and improving infrastructure, finance and markets; (ii)
Enhancing human development and social protection through improved education, health,
social protection, and community services; and (iii) Strengthening public sector management
and budgetaryprocesses to enable Georgia to better plan and meet its own development goals.
Along with the CPS, the first PRSO, o f a series o f three single tranche annual Poverty
Reduction Support Operations was approved o f which US$13.5 million i s a regular IDA credit
and US$6.5 million is an IDA grant.          Other recent operations include a US$5 million
Infrastructure Pre-Investment Facility Project, a US$3 million Public Sector Financial
Management Reform Support Project, a US$24 million Reform Support Credit, a US$20
million Secondary and Local Roads Project, a US$3.6 million Electricity Market Support
Project, a US$10 million Rural Development Project, and a US$5 million Irrigation and
Drainage Community Development Project Additional Funding for flood control. The Bank
continues its discussion with the Government on a more comprehensive medium-termreform
strategy that would be supported by future Poverty Reduction Support Operations and technical
assistance operations.
