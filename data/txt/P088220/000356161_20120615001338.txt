                                  RESTRUCTURING PAPER

     A. SUMMARY

1.     The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the Argentina Urban Flood
Prevention and Drainage Project APL1, a €98.0 million loan approved by the World
Bank Board on April 5, 2005, is to reduce the Borrower’s vulnerability to flooding
through the improvement of the level of protection of the Borrower’s rain drainage
system and the implementation of a risk management program. The Project has been
under implementation for just under seven years and progress toward achievement of
these objectives is currently rated as Satisfactory.

2.          To adjust to implementation experience the following changes are proposed:

     (i)       Changes to Project indicators and target values to simplify the results
               framework, clarify ambiguities around the quantification of certain values,
               and accurately reflect activities financed under the Project and their outcomes;

     (ii)      Extension of the closing date to August 31, 2012 (amounting to 2 months) and
               completing ongoing technical assistance activities and works; and,

     (iii)     Reallocation of funds from two of the Loan Agreement disbursement
               categories (“Non-Consultant Services? and “Goods?) to the “Consultants'
               Services and Project Audits? disbursement category.


     B. PROJECT STATUS

3.      The Project’s overall implementation progress and its progress towards
achievement of the PDO are currently rated as Satisfactory. The Project has committed
100% of the total loan amount of €98.0 million which amounts to US$134.13 million at
current exchange rates. Of the total loan amount, US$131.22 million has been disbursed,
with US$2.92 million still to be disbursed1. Available funds under the Project will not be
sufficient to cover the original scope foreseen in the PAD due to higher actual costs
relative to the cost estimates made at appraisal. The increase in costs for the works
resulted from the long time lag needed for contracting and design, inflation adjustments
in the works contract, currency exchange variations, and design changes. In addition, the
costs for certain consultant contracts were higher than those anticipated at appraisal.

4.     After an 18 month extension approved in 2010, the Project's new closing date is
June 30, 2012. The Project was also restructured to reflect changes in implementation
arrangements, which consisted of the transfer of responsibilities for technical

  The originally approved loan amount of €98.000.000 was equivalent to US$130.000.000 at the exchange
rate prevailing at that time; due to variations in the exchange rate since approval, the approved amount
currently stands at US$134.133.880 equivalent.

coordination of the Project from the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Urban
Development, within the Government of the City of Buenos Aires.

5.      In spite of delays early on in Project implementation, the Project has followed a
good execution pace. The construction of both tunnels (9.8 and 4.6 kms in length
respectively) has been finalized with the shorter tunnel now in operation. The
performance tests for the "long" tunnel are planned for June 2012.

6.     Non-structural measures, requiring inter-institutional coordination within several
of the City's agencies, have lagged behind in implementation, with structural measures
consuming most of the financial resources. The main activities under way are the
preparation of a master plan for the management of green areas and urban forestry, and
consultancies for the certification of works and inspection of works.

7.     Project funds are insufficient to finance construction of the secondary network in
the Maldonado basin (Part B (2) of the Project as described in Schedule 2 to the Loan
Agreement), which is central to the proper functioning of the drainage system of which
the tunnels are part as well as non-structural measures related to the hydro-meteorological
warning system (Part A.2 as described in Schedule 2 of the Loan Agreement)
environmental communication and education program (Part A (6) of the Project as
described in Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement), and the preparation of a strategy for the
management of solid waste (Part A (4) of the Project as described in Schedule 2 to the
Loan Agreement).

8.      The Government of the City of Buenos Aires has informed that funding has been
allocated from the 2012 City Budget for the construction of the first two of the six
planned groups of secondary networks (groups A and B), and have manifested their
intention to conclude all of the remaining secondary drainage networks and they are
currently looking for possible funding alternatives. The government of the City of
Buenoes Aires has also indicated their commitment to carrying out all remaining non-
structural measures under the Project once funding is identified.

  C. PROPOSED CHANGES

Closing Date

9.      The closing date would be extended by 2 months to August 31, 2012 to allow for
finalizing consultancies for the certification of works, the inspection of works and the
master plan for green spaces.

Results/indicators

10.     Some of the indicators to monitor the PDO and intermediate outcome indicators
have been revised to improve measurability and relevance to the operation. Based on a
detailed analysis carried out during the December 2011 Supervision Mission (and
recorded in Annex I of the corresponding Aide Memoire), changes to the indicators were
agreed as described in the results framework in Annex 1. The main adjustments are as
follows:


                                            4
    (i)      Component 1: indicators 1(a) and 1(b) have been revised and redefined to
             improve measurability; indicator 1(f) was removed due to redundancy with
             indicator 1(a); and indicator 1(g) was removed and merged with indicator 1
             (c).

    (ii)     Component 2: to improve precision, indicator 2(a) was redefined as four sub-
             indicators to be used once the hydraulic and hydro-meteorological monitoring
             system is operational2; indicator 2(b) was revised and redefined to improve
             measurability; and indicator 2(c) was removed due to redundancy.

Financing

11.     The project experienced both delays and cost increases during implementation.
Most significantly, the initial cost estimates made during project preparation for the
infrastructure works were lower than the actual costs at the time of bidding and
construction.

12.      In the interest of ensuring the impact of the project, during project implementation
the majority of funds and efforts were focused on the development of key defense
facilities (Part B of the Project, as described in Schedule 2 to the Loan Agreement).

13.     Due to this prioritization in the allocation of the limited resources and the related
postponement of non-works activities, the “Non-Consultant Services? and “Goods?
disbursement categories set forth in the Loan Agreement designed for activities related to
the hydro-meteorological warning system, the environmental communication and
education program and the preparation of a strategy for the management of solid waste,
could not be funded by the loan resources. Additionally, the activities of certification of
works, the inspection of works and the master plan for green spaces under the
“Consultant Services and Project Audits? category were not initiated until recently and
will cost more than anticipated at appraisal.

14.    To allow for the completion of the above mentioned activities under the
“Consultant Services and Project Audits? category using the loan funds, in addition to the
extension of the closing date, the Project restructuring will reallocate funds corresponding
to the “Non-Consultant Services? and “Goods? disbursement categories of the Loan
Agreement to the “Consultants’ services and Project Audits? disbursement category.

15.    The following table specifies the categories of Eligible Expenditures that may be
financed out of the proceeds of the Loan (“Category?) in light of the proposed
Restructuring, the reallocations of the amounts of the Loan to each Category, and the
percentage of expenditures to be financed for Eligible Expenditures in each Category:

 These indicators were developed based on a simulation model, and include: consistency of mathematical
model with measurements, and maximum total output flow, storm water levels in the street, and additional
drainage capacity.
