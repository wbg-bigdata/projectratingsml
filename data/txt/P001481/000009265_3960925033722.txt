was closed on December 31, 1984, three years behind schedule (w .th an
undisbursed balance of  US$0.3  million  being  cancelled).   Total project
costs were Fmg. 5.4 billion (as compared to an appraisal estimate of Fmg.
4.2 billion, i.e., a 28% overrun), but because of exchange rate fluctua-
tions, only US$18.0 million equivalent vs. an appraisal estimate of US$19.3
million. Since Norway made a grant contribution of US$6.4 million equiva-
lent, after the credit became effective, the net debt incurred under the
Credit amounted  to  US$7.3  million  equivalent.    Government's financial
participation was US$4.3 million equivalent, or about 24% of total project
cost.
Objectives and Project Content
The project was to help develop Madagascar's basic education
system while improving  its  cost-efficiency.    It comprised the following
componentss
(a) civil works, furniture and equipment for a national learning
materials center (CNAPMAD) and for five regional academic
centers (CAPR);
(b) textbook development; and
(c) project administration and technical assistance (paras. 1.2-
1.4).
Implementation Experience
The project experienced substantial delays--eight years instead of
five from effectiveness to credit closing. The reasons for this were part-
ly administrative/organizational such as insufficient coordination among
participating Government agencies, lack of full-time staff in the PIU, and
partly logistical--need for site changes/modifications, unavailability of
materials (paras. 2.3-2.4, 3.3-3.5, 3.15).



- v -
Despite three closing date extensions two of the five regional
academic centers were not ready at the end of the Implementation period,
and textbook production had not yet started (paras. 3.13, 5.18). In an
effort to use credit funds fully and to cover emergency investment needs,
IDA, in August 1984, agreed to a reallocation of funds to finance recon-
struction of cyclone damages to some 20 schools in two provinces (para.
1.5).
Some of the buildings provided under the project show a number of
design flws but the physical structures are generally of good quality
(and, in the case of CRAPMAD, were thought to be even too elaborate)
(paras. 3.10-3.12). However, most of the woodwork appears to be suffering
fr(m low quality and inadequate preparation of the materials used and, at
the time of completion was already in urgent need of repairlreplacement;
the same remark applies to locally made furniture (paras. 3.16, 3.18).
A total of 118 vehicles were procured under the project. In spite
of some spare parts purchased in 1984 more than half of the vehicles used
in the provinces were beyond repair by the end of the Implementation period
(para. 3.20). Equipment (mainly for the Regional Academic Centers) is on
the whole suitable and of good quality but was, at completion time, still
kept stored in the workshops because the main facilities did not provide
adequate protection against theft, or because additional work (foundations,
supply lines, drainage, etc.) had still to be done (para. 3.21).
Technical assistance to CNAPIAD, despite a rtduction by 302 (from
216 to 150 man-months) achieved its objective of hslping that institution
in its initial phase; unfortunately, another TA component of 48 man-months
to assist with educational planning and statistics work, had to be elimi-
nated to compensate for cost overruns in the CNAPEAD TA program; its
resumption under a new project was envisaged (para. 3.25).
Operations Results
Operation of the project institutions has been severely affected
by deteriorating economic conditions: budgetary constraints forced the
Government in 1982 to stop recruitment of national service (VSN) teachers
which in turn meant that teacher training activities in the five CAPR are
only a fraction of the volume envisaged (varying from 4 to 421 of appraisal
estimates, with even lower use factors for dormitories) (para. 5.6). By
the same token, the envisaged educational support role of the ce& _ers is
severely curtailed by the aforementioned lack of serviceable vehicles.
In the case of CNAPHAD, the opposite has happeneds even during
initial implementation, its area of responsibilities was expanded requir-
ing, in response, an augmentation of CNAPHAD's physical facilities by over
40%. Even this expansion, however, provad insufficient as the schools'
needs for educational materials and, apparently, available funds for their
production proved larger than anticipated and led to the establishment of
an industry-scale production line of materials (pars. 6.1).



In addition, purchae of  a printi     prsess  originally not fore-
seen, creatid a production capacity for 750,000 textbooks a year which is
now coming on stream and which is expected to operate with full cost recov-
ery by 1988 (paras. 3.8, 5.8-5.10, 5.15-5.18).
Sustainabilitv
Satisfactory operation of the project facilities depens above all
on the availability of adequate budget resources. In the ca8e of CUAPMAD,
the increased scope of operatios  ha  augmented recurrent budget require-
ments considerably.  However, the increasingly cmmerial mode of operation
promises an ease on financial constraints within the next fe years (paras.
6.6-6.7).
For the CAPR  the  situation  is more  difficults   not only have
persistent budget constraints put a stop to teacher recruitment, thus de-
priving the centers of their main purpose--teacher traiing and upgrading--
but in addition Insufficient quality control in their construction and
furnishing is now resulting In much high   mintatenance and repair require-
ments than would normally have been the case. An accelerated devolution of
administrative and educational responsbilities to the centers way help
accomplish a more efficient use of these facilities (pareas. 5.5-5.6).
Conclusions
The experience of this project underlines the Importance of
(i) a clear definition of responsibilities end functions of
goverment agencies participating  In project ipleentation,
complemsnted by adequate full-tie staffing
(ii) proper synchronization of civil works and furnitur,loquipment
deliverie to avoid protracted idling of major investment
items;
(iii) appropriate arrangemnts for the operation, maintenance,
repair and replacment of vehicles;
(iv) stringent quality controls for civil works, furniture and
equipment; and
(v) careful adherence to the original project concept Including
sise, composition and tyep of use of project facilities; if
major modifications are  inevitable,  a detailed assesment of
the Implications in term of effective desmad and incremental
resource requirements, should precede such a decision.

MADAGCR
SECOND EDUCATION PROJECT
(CESDIT 663-MAG)
CHAPE  I
PRO.CT   IGINS AID
A.    Project Orlai
1.1   The composition of the Second Education Project was identified
during a Bank mission in 1974. The project envisaged was prepared
by the Government with the help of a Unesco team in October 1975
and an appraisal mission then visited Madagascar in December 1975.
The draft appraisal report was discussed by government and bank
officials in June 1976 and the final version was issued in October
1976. The total estimated cost was US$19.26 million of which US$14
million was to be financed by the World Bank.
B.    Project 8trategy and ObJectives
1.2   The project  strategy was to help the Government minimlze
recurrent expenditures and at the same time maximize impact on basic
education through:
(a)    assistance to curricula to change the structure and
content of basic education;
(b)    introduction   of   improved   learning   methods   and
techniques;
(c)    use of National Service teachers to reduce average
class sizes to a more reasonable level without unduly
increasing recurrent costs;
(d)    in-service training of existing teachers;
(e)    support to the inspectorate to help* it keep teachers
abreast of new developments in content, learning methods
and techniques; and
(f)    decentralization  of  educational  administration  to
enable it to become more responsive to local needs.
1.3    The main thrust of the project would be on institution building
for the improvement of primary education, but secondary education
would  also  be  assisted.    The  project would:   (i)  provide  the
administrative facilities required for the decentralization of
education, training facilities for about 20% of the National
Servicemen to be trained as teachers, and vehicles to enable primary
school inspectors to visit the schools more regularly; (ii) establish
a centre for the production of teaching mterials; and (iii) help
the development of primary school textbooks.



-2-
C.     ProJect Con*Xt 
1.4    The project comprised the following elements:
(a)    construction of buildings and provision of furniture
and  equipment  for:   (i)  the five CAPRs  (provincial
academic centres) which, in addition received vehicles
for the CAPRs school inspectorate and; (ii) CNAPMAD
(National Centre for the Production of Educational
Teaching Materials);
(b)    preparation of school textbooks;
(c)    provision  of technical assistance for:   (i)  CNAPMAD
in its initial operation stages; (ii) the statistical
section of the MOE and; (iii) project evaluation;
(d)    project administration and pre-investment studies.
1.5    In August 1984 an unused part of the credit was applied to
the reconstruction of 20 educational institutions damaged or destroyed
by the Kamisy cyclone in the region of Mahajunga and Antsiranana.



CHAPTER II
PROJECT ADMINISTRATION
2.1    The Project Unit was established in the Ministry of Public
Works by a decree dated 13 October 1976 after approval by the World
Bank of its composition.
2.2    To  start  with  the  Project  Unit  had  a  director  and  two
coordinators (an architect and an educator), with support staff
provided jointly by the Ministries of Public Works and Education.
In 1977 the post of coordination architect was abolished and in
1979 it was replaced by one of an accountant. In 1980 additional
support staff for all financial matters was assigned in the Ministry
of the Presidency, Finance and Planning.
2.3    Despite relative stability aind the assignement of ample support
staff (see Annexes 18 and 19), implementation of the project suffered
gaps and difficulties through the lack of:
(a)    definition  of  the  responsible  authorities  and  the
responsibilites and tasks of the Project Unit staff;
(b)    coordination   among   the   authorities    concerned,
particularly oetween the Ministry of Public Works
(MTP) and the Ministry of Secondary and Basic Education
(MINESEB);
(c)    full-time staff in the Project Unit and availability
of support staff;
(d)    interest  by the authorities  during the first years
of the project.
Further there was a lack of premises which led to the Project Unit
splitting in two:  the directorate was installed in the MTP while
the rest of the staff was located first in a school and then in
CNAPMAD.
2.4    An international short list of 11 building firms was made
in July 1977 but tendering had to be deferred until July and October
1978 owing to a lengtby shortage of reproduction materials - ozalid,
paper, ink and ammonia.
2.5    After  substantial  cost  over-runs  some bidding  had  to  be
repeated or negotiated so as to remain within the bounds of the
financial limits foreseen. Further, work on three of the six project
institutions was divided into sections so as to allow for a better
cost control in a period of high inflation and of starting work
despite illegal occupation of part of the sites (see paragraph 3.2).
2.6    Site supervision was carried out jointly by MTP's decentralized
services, by the offices responsible for studies (SEIMAD and BMET)
and by the Project Unit.



- 4 -
2.7    In 1984,  cyclone damage repair work,  financed from project
funds, was given to the firms building the Mahajunga and Antsiranana
CAPRs by emergency procedure approved by the Bank. All responsibility
for studies and implementation was handed over to the National Cyclone
Damage Coordination Committee (MTP).
2.8    Implementation  of  the  educational  aspects  of  the  project
was to be carried out at three levels:
(a)    national level - by the Directorate of School Planning
and Orientation;
(b)    the project unit - by the project coordinator;
(c)    provincial level - by the CAPR head.

CHAPTER III
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION
A.    Project Duration
3.1    Implementation of the approved project took place over eight
years instead of the five foreseen at appraisal (see Annex 2). To
permit its accomplishment the closing date was put back first to
31 December 1982, then to 30 June 1983, and lastly to 31 December
1984 to allow for repairing cyclone damage, which was not initially
foreseen in the project. The last disbursements of the credit were
made on 17 July 1985.
B.     Physical Implementation
1.     Sites
3.2    The  sites  chosen  for the Antisiranana   and Toliary CAPRs
were, when work began,  partly occupied by squatters.   The siting
of buildings and the distribution of priority sections of the work
were changed to enable construction to begin before the sites were
completely cleared.
3.3    The  site  chosen  for the  Fianarantsoa  CAPR  sloped  sharply
and entailed substantial expenditures to terrace and drains.
3.4    In January 1978 the site chosen for CNAPMAD was curtailed
by about a fifth of its area, which obliged the Studies Office to
modify its plans and revise siting in general.
3.5    The site for reconstruction of the Mahajunga Teacher Training
School was apparently chosen because ot its purchase price. Account
was not taken of its distance from the town (6 kms), of its
environment (a cemetery and a public rubbish dump are in the immediate
neighbourhood), and of the cost of supplying electricity, for which
more than a kilometer of cable will have to be run.
2.     Architectural Services
3.6    The architectural studies for CNAPMAD and the Fianarantsoa
CAPR were entrusted to a private consultant firm (BMET) and those
for the other four CAPRs to a semi-private consultant firm (SEIMAD).
3.7    The initial architectural programme (Annexe 4) for the CAPRs
has remained practically unchanged.   Only the two houses foreseen
were deleted for economic reasons, while the areas constructed have
remained more or less the same as at appraisal (+9.6%).



- 6 -
3.8   The  architectural  programme  for  CNAPMAD  (Annex  4)  was
considerably modified on recommendations made by technical advisers
to better meet production requirements of the different trades. Tne
total constructed area was increased by about 42 per cent compared
with appraisal entailing a substantial rise in construction costs.
3.9    The initial programme, drawn up in August 1984, of cyclone
damage repair took in 11 institutions in Antsiranana and Zen at
Mahajunga. In December 1984 three other school groups were added
to the Antsiranana list in an attempt to use as much as possible
of the funds available before closure on 31 December 1984.
3.    Architectural Design
3.10   Provincial academic  centres:   the  buildings  for  the  four
CAPRs  entrusted to SEIMAD were designed by different architects
and while some buildings are similar the general concept is different
for each CAPR.  The architects followed the advice of the Project
Unit that local materials should be used, especially at Mahajunga,
Toliary and Toamasina.   Accommodation  is distributed by activity
areas in buildings of one to three storeys, linked by covered ways.
The overall concept is generally good and functional but errors
of detail are numerous, particularly in the protection of openings
from rainfall (except at Fianarantsoa); in the placing and choice
of rainwater run-offs (Toliary' and Mahajunga); in the dangerous
opening of windows on to circular areas (Toliary); in the many-
windowed photographic laboratories and in the unsuitable choices
of locks and of electrical material. Further, the location of offices
opening on to a central corridor does not permit sufficient
ventilation, while the placing of sun shades is often unsuitable.
3.11   CNAPMAD:    the  CNAPMAD  buildings  designed  by  BWET  in
collaboration with ORT technical staff are functional both in overall
plan and in work spaces. It should however be noted that economies
could have been made in the selection of the materials and structure
of workshops and storerooms, for which construction methods currently
used in industry would have done.
3.12   Cyclone  damage:   technical  studies  of  repairs  to  damaged
school buildings were made by MTP !n collaboration with a control
office and on the basis of inspections made on the spot by the
technicians sent from Public Works regional offices. Studies, cost-
estimates and a start on work were made in record time to get things
ready as fast as possible and to replace the framing and roofing
torn away by the cyclone.  It should, however, be noted that in
some cases details were not well studied, particularly roof
gutterings, drainpipes and roof ventilation.
4.    Construction
3.13   Progress of work:  the CNAPMAD Fianarantsoa and CAPR buildings
are fully complete. The second phase of the Antsirarana CAPR is
40 per cent finished and the contracts for the Toliary CAPR are
75 per cent completed (site development, weather proofing and 30



- 7 -
per cent of the administration building remain to be finished). Only
the kitchen in the Fiananantsoa CAPR is installed: the other four
are in the course of installation or construction. Cyclone damage
repair work financed by the project are complete or are being finished
except for the teacher training school (40 per cent finished) and
the Mahajunga CAPE, repairs to which are 70 per cent done.
3.14  After an international short-listing of firms, tenders were
invited in July and August of 1978 and bidding and the designation
of contractors were done in April and July 1979 - 15 and 8 months
late (see paragraph 2.4).  Substantial cost over-runs obliged the
Government to delete directors' and trainers' housing and to reduce
external works such as fences, pathways and landscaping. For the
Mahajunga and Fianarantsoa CAPEs the priority sections of the
construction work were so determined as to enable the most urgent
works to begin within the financial limits.
3.15 Construction of the Toamasina CAPR was the only work not
to fall behind schedule. With the other five the delay occuring
before tenders were invited (see paragraph 2.4) was further
accentuated during construction and stretched to from 7 to 57 months
compared with the dates foreseen at appraisal (Annex 2). Most of
the construction projects encountered substantial difficult!es which
slowed work down considerably or even stopped it completely for
several months  (12 at Antsiranana).   Such difficulties were due
to:
(a)    substantial earthmoving work, which delayed the start
of construction (Fianarantsoa);
(b)    general shortages of imported materials - steel, cement,
corrugated iron and fuel due to limitations imposed
by the prioroity given to the regional university
centres (CURB);
(c)    shortages  of local materials at the  sites,  due to
inadequate skilled production capacity;
(d)    social  difficulties  and  a  building  workers  strike
with occupation of the Toliary construction site;
(e)    firms' financial difficulties (Toliary and Antsiranana).
3.16   The main building work is generally of good quality but most
of the woodwork at Toliary, Toamasina and Mahajunga is already in
such a state of deterioration as to need urgent replacement. The
timber is of poor quality, badly seasoned and badly treated (frames
had wood preservatives applied with a brush when in place instead
of being impregnated before erecting) and so offer no resistance
to either termites or bad weather. At Mabajunga these defects are
being repaired under the cyclone-damage budget.   At Toliary the
buildings have not yet been taken over and the contraca-ors will
have to make good the parts affected.  (For Toamasina no financing
means has yet to be found). Further, the metal fittings and outer
locks of all the CAPEs are unsuitable or of poor quality and do
not permit efficient protection against break-ins and the theft
of breakable costly equipment (thefts of materials and equipment



- 8 -
have already been reported at Toamasina and Mabajunga). Again the
electrial installations made at Mahajunga by JIRAMA are badly fitted,
ugly and sometimes dangerous, (junctions and liners next to rainwater
hoppers, byepassing of fuseboards, etc.).
5.    Furniture
3.17   Procurement of furniture financed by the project was made
by international tender in January 1980 for CNAPMAD and in March
1981 for the CAPRs. Contractors were designated at the same time.
Those for most of the wooden furniture were given to national firms
and the rest to foreign ones. The furniture imported was delivered
in May 1982 and that made or sold in the country in December 1980
for CNAPMAD and between January and November 1983 for the CAPRs.
There were thus delays of more than three years compared with
appraisal forecasts, or of one year if account is taken of the dates
specified in the contracts.
3.18   On the whole the imported furniture is suitable and meets
the needs. By contrast the wood used in local production, although
solid, was unseasoned so that the contractors had to fill joints
and cracks after delivery.   Further the joinery is generally too
weak for the furniture's weight which often causes losses during
transportation and handling.
6.    Equilment
3.19  Equipment lists, specifications and quantities were prepared
in 1977 by MINESEB in agreement with the project unit. After several
revisions of the lists and of the composition of lots, tenders were
invited in 1978 and 1979.
3.20   The vehicles financed by the project were procured in three
phases: five vehicles were bought in May 1978 for the project unit
and CNAPMAD, 95 vehicles for district educational advisers and 18
others for the CAPRs were obtained by tender in 1979 and 1981. A
request for a further 17 vehicles for the use of 15 new districts
and the distribution of CNAPMAD materials was refused by the Bank
in 1983.  Spare parts financed by the project were delivered in
1984, which enabled a certain number of vehicles to be restored
to running order but more than half of those delivered to the
provinces remain beyond repair after five years of use in difficult
conditions.
3.21   CAPR equipment was procured and delivered at the same time
as the furniture. On the whole the equipment is of good quality
and suits the CAPRs' initial objectives, but is at present stored
in the workshops because:
(a)    the other buildings  cannot be securely locked  (see
paragraph 3.16);
(b)    the audio-visual rooms and workshops are not in use;
(c)    the  kitchens  are  not  yet  installed  (except  at
Fianarantsoa).



-9-
It is doubtful however,   whether the advanced equipment selected
for the kitchens can function for long, owing to reduction in
oper;,ing budgets, difficulties in the supply of spare parts and
lack of skilled staff.  Further, the lack of coordination between
the supplier and the contractors will entail additional work for
bases,  piping,  supply-lines and drainage which were not foreseen
or do not meet the requirements of the equipment delivered. Further
it should be pointed out that as the project did not provide for
purchases of books, the CAPR libraries have stayed empty except
for a few books and other publications inherited from the local
administration.
3.22   CNAPMAD's equipment was obtained in three phases.  The first
tender invitations, sent out at the same time as the CAPR one, were
based on lists drawn up to match reduced targets for the production
of educational materials intended to serve as models for the
production from the CAPR workshops. An assessment of needs based
on centralized industrial production led the authorities to send
out in April 1982 a new invitation to tender for complementary
equipment for the wood, glass and mechanical workshopb   The first
orders were delivered in 1980 and 1981, with delays of some months
beyond the contract dates owing to difficulties of rail transport
between Toamasina and Antanarivo.  Equipment from the second lot
of tenders was delivered between June and October 1983, three years
after the appraisal dates  foreseen.  Another batch of equipment
was ordered in 1984 for the woodwork shop, the production capacity
of which still falls short of needs.
3.23   In  December  1979  the  Bank  agreed  to  conversion  of  the
publication material and of the 1,500 tonnes of paper foreseen at
appraisal into equipment for the printing press which the Government
had decided  to  establish beside CNAPMAD.  Invitations to tender
were put out in May 1982 on the basis of lists prepared by a
consultant and deliveries were staggered between January and April
1985, two years behind the contract dates, owing to late construction
of the workshops and delays in settling suppliers' accounts.
C.    Technical Assistance (Annex 6)
1.    Expert Services
3.24  At appraisal the project provided for 48 man/months of expert
services  for  educational planning.  This  assistance  comprised  a
specialist in items related to education and another for school
infrastructure. In addition the project was to finance 216 man/months
of specialist services for starting up CNAPMAD.
3.25  All technical assistance for the project was entrusted in
September 1977 to the Union Mondiale ORT, for a total of 216
mn/months. The programme laid down at appraisal was, by agreement
with the Bank, re-designed so that:



- 10 -
(a)    the  content  of  assistance  to  CNAPMAD  was  modified
the better to meet the project's immediate needs -
assistance in building design, in drawing up lists
and specifications for equipment, and in training
staff for starting production;
(b)    assistance  for  educational  planning was  dropped  to
compensate cost over-run in the ORT contract.   This
component will in part be taken up again by the UNDP
project MAG/79/002 with Unesco assistance.
3.26   The ORT assistamce was in the end reduced by 66 man/months
to balance increases in technical assistance costs.  Despite this
reduction and early difficulties - payment and construction delays
and lack of qualified counterparts - the technical assistance balance
is  positive.   It  greatly  contributed  to  CNAPMAD's  establishment
and starting up, enabling it rapidly to attain its production targets
and even surpass them.
2.     Training Fellowships
3.27   The project provided for the financing of 48 man/months of
fellowships for glass-blowers intended for CNAPMAD as well as of
fellowships and study tours for educational evaluation. With the
Bank's agreement it was decided that the training of glass blowers
should take place on the spot, with the assistance of an ORT
specialist. However, the project financed 55 man/months of fellowships
for  the  CNAPMAD  directorate  and  for  those  responsible  for  its
maintenance services, its study office and its technical directorate.
Later, three other fellowships of three months each were awarded
for printing, photo-composition and reproduction at the printing
press, and a one-month course was financed for CNAPYAD's directorate
of production and maintenance.
In addition the project financed:
(a)    a  study  visit  to  Mauritius  for  project  management
and the production of educational materials (six persons
from 19/9/80 to 1/10/80);
(b)    a  study visit  to Rumania on educational structures
and the production of educational materials (four
persons from 2/12/80 to 7/12/80);
(c)    a study visit to Algeria on the same subject (four
persons):  this visit was cancelled by the Algerian
authorities while the group was on its way;
(d)    participation in a Unesco seminar in Burundi on school
textbooks (one person fror. 6-12/9/83);
(e)    a  training  seminar  for  statisticians  and  planners
organized at Mantasoa with Unesco participation (18
participants and 11 trainers from 28/6/79 to 14/7/79).
D.     Iwleieutation of Credit Conditions (Annex 3)
3.28 The state of lmplementation of the credit covenant is shown in

agreement have been only partially fulfilloei, particularly as regards
the  project  unit  staff  (Section  3.04)  ant the  project's impact
(Ssction 3.08), upkeep and repair of project buildings (Section 4.02)
and information about decentralization (Section 4.08).
E.     Wbr3A Bank supervision
3.29 The project benefited from 15 supervision missions from
December 1976 to May 1983, an average of a mission every five months.
The average duration was nine days and all but four missions included
an architect.   Their distribution was, however,  uneven with four
missions in 1979 and only one in 1980, 1981 and 1982.
3.30   The main problems were identified during these missions and
recommendations were formulated and transmitted to the national
authorities. However, such recommendations often had only a limited
impact on the progress of the project, the major problems this
encountered   being   linked   with   the   country's  economic  and
administrative difficulties and with the great changes which took
place in its administration, especially in the educational planning
team.
3.31 The Bank however, could have been able to contribute to the
improvement of project implementation by greater insistance on the
project unit's staff being permanent and on better definitions of
each member's responsibilities.
3.32 From the supervision reports it emerges that the project's
educational component has been neglected to the benefit of the
physical  and  financial  parts.    More  frequent  participation  by
educators and/or educational planners vould certainly have contributed
to a better balance among the project's components.
3.33 There was no Bank supervision mission between May 1983 and
December 1984, the project's closing date.  Better supervision of
implementation during the final months would certainly have speeded
up disbursements and so reduced the unused part of the credit.

COSTS ADD FINANCING
A.     Appraisal Report Estimates
4.1    At  appraisal the total cost of the project was estimated
at USS19.26 million and the foreign exchange component at US$9.12
million. The US$14 million credit was to cover 73 per cent of the
total cost with all taxes included or 80 per cent of the cost without
tax. It was to enable all foreign exchange expenditure to be covered
and 58 per cent of local expenditure was tax free.
B.     Actual Costs
4.2    The actual cost of the project was 6.5 per cent below the
appraisal estimate in dollars and 28.4 per cent higher in Malagasy
Francs (Fmg).

1/     Excluding disbursements made after the completion mission.
4.4    While the total cost of the project in US dollars has proved
slightly reduced despite the three-year time lag, this is really
due to the rise of the dollar' S exchange rate against the Malagasy
franc  (see  exchange  zate,  p.v.).   The  difference  noted  between
estimated and actual expenditures by category are due to:
(a)    additional equipment bought by CNAPMAD;
(b)    furniture expenditures being entered under equipment;
(c)    cancellation of expenditures for educational evaluation,
a project of which a small part was carried out with
financing from Unicef (see paragraph 5.23);
(d)    expenditures for cyclone damage which were not foreseen
at appraisal (see paragraph 5.25).
C.     Sources of Financing (Annexes 7 and 8)
4.5    Government  participation  in  financing  was  slightly  below
that foreseen at appraisal (-2.4%). This was partly due to a change
In the financing of imported furniture (100 per cent by the Bank),
to an increase in equipment expenditures - the financing of which
by  the  credit  rose  from 85  to  89  percent  - and also  to the
distribution of financing for cyclone damage repairs, 90 per cent
of which were financed by the Bank.

D.     Unit Costs (Annex 10)
4.6    Construction unit costs rose from 23 to 40 per cent between
appraisal (1976) and the signing of contracts for all the construction
sites (1978/79).   The construction costs of the Fianarantsoa CAPS
rose by 84 per cent (+90% in US$) owing to very high expenditures
on site works and draining. For the others the cost rose by different
degrees according to the rate of implementation and date construction
ended.
E.     Tecknical Assistance Costs
4.7    Technical assistance  expenditures  for  training  fellowships
slightly exceeded appraisal forecasts (+7.2%) despite a substantial
reduction  In the duration of experts'  contracts (-51.85%).   This
excess was mainly due to the high cost of ORT assistance and to
the delay in CNAPNAD's implementation which had as a consequence
the increase of contingency rates for this category.
F.     Iwleentation and Witbdrawals Calendar
4.8    The comparative calendar in Annex 2 shows up very substantial
delays in all components, especially for the construction of the
Toliary and Antairanana CAPRs. (52 months), the ones at Pianarantsoa
and Mahajunga  (15 and 12 months),  CNAPMAD (12 months), equipment
deliveries (36 months), fellowships (33 months), and the recruitment
technicians for CNAPMAD (2'1 months). Only with the construction
of the Toamsina CAPR and the delivery of vehicles was there little
delay compared with scheduling. All these delays had repercussions



- 15 -
on the credit withdrawals calendar (Annexes 9 and 10) in the form
of a very slow start during the first three years, followed by a
gentle acceleration in 1980.  Termination of construction in 1981
resulted in a slowing down of withdrawals, with a slight pick-up
in 1982/83 due to the purchase of equipment. The addition of cyclone-
damage repairs brought only a few changes in disbursements in 1984
and 1985, and these stayed below the pace of the preceding years.
G.     Cyclone Dazi1ge and Credit R1eu,nders
4.9    The  sum allocated under Credit 663-MAG for the repair of
cyclone damage was fixed by a credit amendment in August 1984 at
US$700,000 (Annex 12) so as to enable use to be made of sums not
drawn  upon  at  that  date  (see  paragraph  1.5).   In  actual  fact
withdrawals  for this  new  component  amounted  to only US$627,832.
Further, since the unfinished constructions at Antsiranana and Toliary
have advanced only a little since the amendment on 30 June 1985,
the date fixed for withdrawals to finish, there was still US$276,516
unused.
H.     Operatin  Costs
4.10   The  1984  and  1985  annual budgets  for DEPESEB/CAPR differ
greatly, being between Fmg 3.5 million for Toliary and Fmg.12.2
million  for Fianarantsao  (excluding salaries).   These differences
are explained by the unequal distribution of the school population
and of staff. Further, part of the Toliary and Antsiranana buildings
are not yet finished and so are not in use.  In any case, their
budgets are inadequate and do not allow a normal development of
training activites.   Further, the lack of funds seriously hampers
the maintenance of buildings, equipment and transport, as well as
the running of kitchens, workshops and laboratories.
4.11   CNAPMAD's estimated budget for 1985 was prepared on the results
of preceding years and of targets set by the Directorate and MINESEB.
It is at present estimated at Fmg.204.5 million for CNAPM-AD itself
and Fmg.211 million for the printing press, with operating subventions
reaching  52.3  per  cent  and  28.6  per  cent  respectively.   These
subsidies are regressive over five years and should allow financial
autonony in 1988.

CHAPTER V
WPO U8tJLST
A.    General Consideratilos
5.1   During  the  eight  a - rs  of  project  implementation  the
educational sitvation in Madagascar has developed considerably,
obliging the authorities at times to revise the general objectives
Apon which identification of the project's components was based.
This has especially been the case with the generalization of
education, which has developed very rapidly and without any real
programming, entailing serious financial and miagement problems.
To lessen such difficulties the Government decided to stop recruiting
teachers, including national service volunteers (VSNs) who were
to be trained in the CAPRs. At the same time structural changes
took place and the Ministry of Education was split In two, secondary
and basic education (MINES9B) being separated from higher education.
Decentralization was then effected separately, CAPRs and CURs being
established in the provinces simultaneously.
B.    Provlncial Aceadedc Centres (CPRS)
1.    Space Utilization
5.2   Construction of the CAPRs aimed at supplying, within the
decentralized framework, administrative and educational premises
in each province. The five CAPRs were built and equipped (Antsiranana
and Toliary are being finished) and all operate under the heading
DPESEB/CAPR. The provincial educational services (SPE) staff whose
premises were old and cramped, were transferred to the new CAPR
offices. Most of the educationsl premises are however under-utilized,
lacking teachers and funds.  6art of the classrooms are at present
occupied by the administration and some are lent to teacher training
schools and the CURs. Further, all the workshops serve as storerooms
for mterials and some other premises are used to house watchmen
and staff.
5.3   The  table  of  the  CAPRs  training  activities  (Annex  14)
summarizes training given by MINESEB in 1984/85. It confirms that
space-utilization rates in the educational premises are very low:
42 per cent at Toamsina, 35 per cent at Fianarantsoa, 23 per cent
at Mahajunga and 7 and 4 per cent for the other two CAPRs. Further,
the number of persons housed in the CAPRs during their training
may be estimated at about a quarter of the total enrolment, so that
the dormitories are practically unused.
2.    Means of Transport
5.4   The project supplied a vehicle for each distrIct, 95 in all,
so as to enable primary schools to be Inspected (paragraph 3.20).
These vehicles, delivered from 1978 on, In fact enabled educational
counsellors and primsry education inspectors to improve the quality



- 17 -
of their services even before the opening of the CAPRs. At present,
half of these vehicles are out of service and their replacement
has not been provided for.  The prrchase of two-wheeled transport,
with aid from Unicef, has provided only a temporary solution and
most of this transport is out of service.
3.     Administrative Responsibilities
5.5    The  opening  of  the  CAPRs  should  enable  the  provincial
authorities to take on wider responsibilities in implementing
educational policy and in educational administration. In the event,
decentralization to the provinces of ministry responsibilities has
been limited: the DPESEBs have inherited the former responsibilities
of the SPEs and to these have been added those of engaging staff
and of distributing the budget within the global allocation of funds
to a province.
4.     Training Activities (Annex 15)
5.6    Besides  their  administrative  responsibilities,  the  CAPRs
were to have the tasks of training serving teachers of all levels
and of training as teachers the BEPC holders who, after a three
months course, were to be assigned to primary schools during the
two years of their national service (VSN). The authorities foresaw
the training from 1978 on, of about 9,000 VSNs a year, but recruitment
was much more rapid than foreseen and the numbers reached more than
35,500 VSNs in 1981.   This lack of coherence in the planning of
primary education forced the Government to revise its primary teacher
recruitment policy.   To cope with the budgetary problems and the
material and administrative constraints thus engendered, MINESEB
decided to stop recruitment in 1982. The CAPRs, which were opened
during 1981 to 1983 have not therefore participated in VSN training
as was foreseen at appraisal, and training for primary education
(level 1) is at present limited to a few in-service refresher courses
for "animateurs" and educational counsellors.   However,  the CAPRs
take part in the training of school leaving certificate holders
("bacheliers") who are called up for national service (ASNs). After
courses of from 15 to 45 days these do one year of national service
in the SFFs (level II).  The CAPRs also give in-service refresher
courses for secondary schc,l teachers of levels II and TII  (Annex
15). In addition, the CAPR buildings accomodate MINESEB's examination
commissions, MES meetings, preparatory meetings for the new school
year, and discussion and seminars organized by other ministries.
5.     Staff
5.7    DPESEB/CAPR staff, recruited wholly from teachers, are intended
mainly for administration.   The number of CAPR teaching staff is
very limited and insufficient to achieve even very reduced educational
training objectives. There is thus under-utilization of premises
and educational equipment supplied by the project (paragraph 5.2
and Table 5.1). A new DPESEB organization chart (Annex 14) providing
for the creation of four divisions, each comprising three or four
sections for education and training is due to be put into force
at the beginning of the 1985/86 school year.



- 18 -
This should make it possible to increase training activities
in so far as the posts described are in fact provided and the CAPRs
are given the corresponding budget. Meanwhile, CUR secondary teachers
are needed for refresher courses for secondary teachers of levels
II and III, and the educational counsellors provide staff for the
"animateur" refresher courses (level I) and ASN training.
v.     National Centre for Educational Materials Production (CNAP?AD)
1.     Space Utilization
5.8    CNAPMAD was  established  to  provide  secondary  schools with
science equipment and educational materials as well as to design
materials and make prototypes for primary schools.  At the start
of project implementation, the premises were designed for larger
scale production than was foreseen at appraisal (paragraph 3.8) and
the equipment supplied by the project corresponded rather to
centralized industrial production (paragraph 3.22) than to the making
of prototypes.  Nevertheless, three years after their opening, the
premises  are  once  more  too  small.   Schools'  needs  for teaching
materials and their financial means are more substantial than was
expec+ed.   Further  the  Centre  has  begun  production  of  school
furniture, with resultant needs to extend the woodwork shop by
adaptation of the storage building and to construct a new paint
shop and a garage financed by FNDE.
2.     CNAPMAD Activities
5.9    The Centre carries out research and studies on the production
of educational materials in conformity with the school curricula
laid down by MINESEB and in collaboration with a committee of
teachers. Technical and pedagogical sheets accompany the materials,
which are tested on the ground before mass production.  Exhibitions
are then held in the CAPRs on the use, handling and upkeep of the
materials.   Mass  production  has  been  progressively  started  with
the arrival of national technicians and of machines, tools and
accompanying equipment resulting from the second invitation to tender
(paragraph  3.22).   After three years of operation,  four sections
are now mass producing materials.
Section               Product                 Material used
1. Woodwork         Individual training materials  Local timber

- 19 -
5.10   Other sections are to be established progressively such as:
Galvanoplasty (to start in 1986)
Ceramics
Audiovisual technology (this cannot at present function owing
to lack of equipment in the schools such as tape recorders
and viewers and of teachers qualified in this field).
3.     Staff
5.11   CNAPMAD is divided into five main services  (Annex 16) and
employs 112 persons of whom 34 are civil servants. Four heads of
services received training fellowships financed by the project
(paragraph 3.27) and several other technicians were trained by their
counterparts  from  ORT  technical  assistance.   French  cooperation
is at present financing technical assistance with an electrician
and a glass technician to train national counterparts.
4.     Sale of Products
5.12   Sales of materials produced by CNAPMAD are made through the
five provincial CAPRs, in which the products are kept on permanent
display. They are also made by PASCOMA (school insurance), a MINESEB
body, which groups the orders from schools and forwards them to
CNAPMAD. Direct sales are made too at the centre and during tours
by its staff.
5.13   The products are mostly sold to public and private educational
establishments but customers also include administrative bodies,
research  organizations,  hospitals,  wholesalers,  state  societies
and individual users.
5.14   The sales of merchandise and finished products in 1985 is
provisionally   estimated   at   Fmg.133,424,oo0   (US$202,7OO)   and
distributed as follows:
Individual training materials                 39 000 000
Group training materials                      24 000 000
Educational games                             10 000 000
Glassware (for laboratories)                  20 000 000
Electrical materials                            3 000 000
Merchandise (chemical and other products)    20 000 000
School furniture                              20 424 000
D.    School Textbook Production
5.15   The project foresaw the provision of 1,500 tonnes of paper
for printing school textbooks. Preparation of texts was to be done
by the Curricula Studies Office (BEPOTP) and the printing was to
be entrusted to the National Press.  Further, the project foresaw
the transfer to CNAPMAD of BEPOTEP's premises, which was old and
unsuitable.



- 20 -
5.16   This  programme  uiderwent  profound  changes  during  project
implementation.   BEPOTEP now became SLP,  installed itself in new
premises before the construction of CNAPMAD began and became
operational with the aid of equipment financed by the UNDP project
MAG/79/002. Further, in view of the extent of the needs for school
textbooks and of the delays caused through the National Press's
production capacity being swamped, MINESEB in 1979 decided to
establish a new press in CNAPMAD.  To do this a credit amendment
enabled the project funds allocated to buying paper to be used to
obtain printing equipment (paragraph 3.23).
5.17   The printing shops financed by FNDE were completed in August
1984 and production began in 1985 with the printing of school end-
of-year examination papers.
5.18   The purchase of pupils' textbooks is included in PASCOMA's
annual school insurance premium and teachers' books are normally
bought by the school's Board of Management or by the teachers
themselves. This sales system should be kept when the books are
printed by CNAPMAD's press. Production capacity has been calculated
to be 150,000 copies a year of each of five titles.   MINESEB foresees
a start being made during the school year 1985/86 with the printing
of three textbooks prepared by SLP and of a manual for teachers
of French with aid from French cooperation.
5.19   The staff of the press consist of 16 members, three of whom
were trained through fellovships financed by the project.
E.     Educational Planning and Statistics
5.20   This component of the project was to have comprised technical
assistance by two experts to:
(a)    proceed to a rationalization of the education system
within the context of decentialization;
(b)    draw-up an invenJory of schools;
(c)    introduce a system of data-processing.
5.21   The technical assistance  in this component was in the end
financed by UNDP's project MAG/79/002 and executed by Unesco for
planning  and  rationalizing  the  reform.   Some  periodical  reports
mentioning the progress of decentralization were sent to the Bank
but there has not been any real in-depth study of this matter.
However, a seminar for training national planners was organized
by MINESEB in July 1979 (paragraph 3.27) with Unesco participation.
This seminar's impact was very slight since only one of the 18
participants is still employed by the Planning Directorate.
5.22   Items (b) and (c) of this component were dropped when project
implementation began.

F.     Educational Evaluation
5.23   This component comprised the establishment of working groups
as part of the organization of MINESEB's Planning Directorate to
examine  and  evaluate:   (a)  regional services'  administration and
management; (b) a new primary education curriculum; and (c) VSN
training programmes.
5.24   Of these three  items  only  (b)  has  been  implemented.   An
evaluation of the education system was made in March 1983, thanks
to Unicef financing. A sector study was made in 19TT with Unesco
assistance and was up-dated in 1978, but so far the manuscript has
not been been printed. In addition, three study tours were financed
by the project for staff from CNAPMAD and MINESEB (paragraph 3.27).
G.    Project Administration and Pre-Investment Studies
5.25   Project implementation results have been described in Chapter
II. Pre-investment studies for a third project are to be made after
the second project's completion mission. A new sector study which
is envisaged will serve as a basis for identifying future projects
to be financed from external sources.
B.     Cyclone Damage
5.26   The emergency programme for the repair of damage caused by
the cyclone was for the greater part implemented during the period
August 1984 to May 1985 and enabled numerous schools in the regions
affected to be made good. Funds were provided by the project for
the repair of 20 of them and 18 have been so far made good (paragraphs
3.12 and 3.13). A more exact initial estimate of repair costs would
however have enabled not only a more extensive programme to be
financed from the credit but the complete amount anlocated to these
workE' to be withdrawn before closure of the credit.

CHAPTER VI
CONCLUSIONS AID IMMENDATIONS
A.     Conclusions
6.1          The  IDA   credit was closed on 31 December 1984, three
years behind schedule.  The total cost of the project was slightly
below appraisal estimates owing to the rise in the dollar exchange
rate during the last years of implementation.
6.2    Of the six components foreseen at evaluation, two have attained
their objectives (CNAPMAD and technical assistance), and four have
partially attained them - the CAPRs, school textbooks, educational
planning and  education management.   A  seventh component,  cyclone
damage repair, added to the project attained its objectives in part.
1.     Provincial Academic Centres
6.2    The physical part of the CAPRs has not yet been entirely
completed but the five centres are now operating. It may, however,
be mentioned that the buildings are already in urgent need of
maintenance and repair of defects. Further, most of the equipment
has not been installed and remains unused.
6.4    The educational part of the CAPRs has been distanced from
the original objectives since recruitment of VSNs was stopped.
Further, the teacher training and refresher courses are still
occasional and inadequate for a real improvement in the quality
of teaching in the provinces.
6.5    The  administrative  component  of the  CAPRs  and DPESEB has
partly attained its objectives with the transfer to new buildings
of the educational services and their re-grouping.   On the other
hand, delegation of administrative responsibilities to the provincial
level  is   still  far   less   extensive  than   f)reseen  in  the
decentralization objectives.
2.     CNAPMAD
6.6    CNAPMAD's initial objectives were extended to the industrial
production of educational materials, requiring larger premises and
more equipment than was foreseen at appraisal. After three years
of operation the new production targets have already been surpassed
and the directorate foresees financial autonony in 1988.
3.     School Textbook Production
6.7    Despite  substantial  changes  during  project  implementation
the textbook production unit is nov ready to function and should
be able to attain financial autonony within five years.



- 23 -
4.    Educational Planning and Evaluation
6.8   Activities on these two components have stayed very limited
and have in part been transferred to UNDP financing for technical
assistance and to Unicef financing for the evaluation of basic
education.
5.    ProJect Administration
6.9   The efficiency of the Project Unit has been seriously hampered
by the lack of solid support from the authorities:   a number of
officials have been designated as members of the unit but few of
them have been available or employed full-time.
6.    Technical Assistance
6.10   The Technical Assistance and training fellowships financed
by the project were all given to CNAPMAD and the printing press.
Better distribution of assistance over the whole project would have
allowed a more balanced development of the other components -
especially educational planning and evaluation for which the
appraisal report foresaw 48 man/months of specialists. These were
not implemented.
B.    Recommendations to the Government
6.11   Future  proJect  management:   to  strengthen  the  project's
administrative and management capacity the Government should:
(a)    define exactly the authorities responsible with their
responsibilities and areas of action;
(b)    define the responsibilities and tasks of any future
project unit, and those of each member of its staff;
(c)    supply  the  material,  financial  and  administrative
means corresponding to the tasks to be accomplished;
(d)    recruit the competent full-time staff needed to perform
the project tasks;
(e)    determine beforehand the administrative channels and
procedures to be used for project implementation;
(f)    give the project unit the means needed to organize
and control implementation in the provinces.
6.12   CAPRs:   the Government  should provide the financial means
and human resources required for the CAPRs' sound functioning,
especially in respect of: (a) finishing off construction and making
good defects; (b) maintenance of buildings and equipment; (c)
preparing and conducting real teacher training and reftesher courses;
(d) using materials and equipment stocked in the workshops; (e)
replacing vehicles out of service; (f) providing documentation and
books needed for training courses and; (g) determining administrative
decentralization procedures.
6.13   Construction:  the Government should not accept the selection
of mediocre materials to reduce the cost of tenders when these exceed



- 24 -
the funds assigned.   It would be preferable, and in the end less
costly, to look for savings by reducing the building programme and/or
to seek more economical technical solutions.
6.14   Educational Planning:  the development of educational reform
requires a speeding up of the establishment of central and provincial
services capable of colleding and analyzing statistical information
with a view to defining educational objectives and programmes.
C.    Recommendations to the Bank
6.15   Project  Preparation:   the  Bank  should  insist  with  the
Government that aU  the points mentioned in paragraph 6.10 about
the pro'ect unit should be well-defined and clarified at the
preparation phase. Later any modifications in the administrative
context should entail adjustment or re-definition of authority and
responsibilities.
6.16   Supervision  Missions:   the   specialist  composition,  the
frequency and the size of future supervision missions should be
more adjusted to weaknesses and difficulties in the project. Further,
more frequent visits to construction sites should make it possible
to avoid costly errors in the choice of materials and construction.
6.17   Building design:  the Bank should exercise a better control
over plans and specifications, especially when it is a matter of
using local materials, so as to avoid technical errors which could
later entail costly repairs.
