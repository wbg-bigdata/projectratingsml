This report contains individual evaluations of each intermediary.
An identical sequence of presentation has been followed for the eight
financieras in Appendices A-H. An appendix letter identifies each page of
text and annex.
For ease of reference, the basic data sheet from the Appraisal
Report has been reproduced on the following page. It provides some basic
information on each of the financieras for purposes of conparison and
contains preliminary 1972 financial data. While major developments in
1972-73 are reflected in the text, actual financial statements for 1972
have not been included in the annexes, as audited figures are not yet
available.

CORPORACION FINANCIERA COLOMBIANA
INTRODUCTION
1.        Colombiana, the oldest and still leading financiera, was established
in 1959 and began operations in the same year. Although it concentrates its
activities in the Bogota area, which is the country's most industrialized, it
is also active in most of the other Departments of Colombia. IFC became a
shareholder as early as 1961.
ORGANIZATION
2.        Share Capital and Ownership.  Colombiana's share capital increased
only 1.5% to Col$139.8 million during 1971, and to Col$144.0 million in 1972.
New subscriptions were made entirely by Colombiana private shareholders. Own-
ership (Annex 1) changed little.  At the end of 1971, priPrate Colombian share-
holders owned 53.7% of the total, foreign and foreign-controlled shareholders,
32.0%, IFC, 14.0%, and two governmental shareholders 0.3%. Colombiana con-
tinued to be widely owned by 203 shareholders, of which Banco de Bogota and
Colseguros, jointly, held about one third of the total. Banco de Bogota with
18.75% had remained the largest shareholder, followed by IFC.
3.        Board of Directors and Management.  Colombiana's Board of Directors,
(Annex 2) which comprises leading Colombian and foreign bankers and business-
men, has continued to meet weekly and to follow closely Colomoiana's operations.
In April 1971, Dr. Luis Machado, IFC's Consultant, was appoirnted Advisor to
Colombiana's Board.
4.        No changes have occurred in Colombiana's management.  Mr. Ignacio
Copete has been President since 1967. He has an impressive professional
record and manages the financiera efficiently.  He is assisted effectively
by three Vice-Presidents.
5.        Staff and Internal Organization.  The financiera's organization
(Annex 3) is adequate, given its present level of operations. Colombiana's
professional staff, which continues to be large compared with other financie-
ras, seems to be the most competent of all financieras, on balance. Internal
procedures and management reporting are satisfactory.
6.        Appraisal and Follow-up.  Colombiana's appraisal work continues to
be of generally good quality. Coverage of engineering asnects by a capable
team of engineers is adequate. Colombiana has become most familiar with the
technique and interpretation of the effective protection calculation which
all financieras introduced in connection with the last Bank loan. Colombiana's
supervision system is well designed.  Powever, actual supervision work in
1971 was relatively poor as staff efforts concentrated on preparing sub-projects
for submission under the last Bank loan, at the expense of follow-up which has
tended to be limited to Colombiana's largest exposures, problem cases and firms

in the construction stage. Management, being aware of the need for improved
supervision employed five new staff members in 1972 who, once they have been
trained, should permit Colombiana to do a satisfactory follow-up job.
7.        Procurement and Disbursement Procedures.  Colombiana, like the other
financieras, largely relies on its clients for proper equipment selection.
Only in the case of larger projects does it require its clients to present
quotations from different suppliers.  Disbursement for imported goods follow
adequate standardized procedures and internal control of disbursements is
satisfactory. However, disbursement control could be improved through more
frequent site visits.
OPERATI ONS
8.        Lending Operations.  A break-down of peso lending operations, in-
cluding loans for import financing with Bank funds, is given in Annex 4. As
Colombiana has approved the largest portion of all financieras under the latest
Bank loan, the total loan approvals almost doubled in 1971 to Col$674.0 million.
Most of the approvals (95.2%) have been for manufacturing, with textiles/
apparel, non-metallic minerals and metals/engineering receiving the largest
share; approvals are well diversified among industrial sectors. Reflecting
the increasing portion of Bank-financed projects in 1971, loans approved were
larger than those of 1970--80% against 60% exceeded Col$5 million--loans for
fixed capital financing went up from 51% to 68% and loan maturities of more
than five years increased from 50% to 68%.  The geographical distribution of
Colombiana's lending has remained the most widespread among the financieras;
46% of its 1971 loan approvals involved clients outside its home Department
of Cundinamarca. Reflecting partly the increasing volume of Bank-financed
projects, Colombiana's foreign exchange financing, in particular short-term
export and import financing, grew substantially in 1971, from US$4.9 million
to US$7.9 million.
9.        Equity Investments and Promotions.  Colombiana's equity portfolio
(Annex 5) increased by 7.0% to Col$176.1 million in 1971. As of the end of
1971, equity investments equalled 69.7% of Colombiana's own equity, compared
with 68.3% a year earlier. The main new investments involved Col$30.9 million
in Celanese Colombiana, and Col$5.7 million in Acabados y Estampados Tintorex
(both operating profitably). Investments of Col$9.0 million in Forjas de
Colombia (in liquidation) and a Col$12.0 million portion of an investment in
El Labrador (operating at a loss) were sold at fractions of cost.  The remainder
of the El Labrador investment was exchanged for shares of Col$6.5 million in a
new company continuing one line of El Labrador's operations. The financiera's
Policy Statement limits its holdings normally to 25% of any one company's
equity and its total exposure in any one company to 25% of its own equity.
Equity investments in excess of the first limit involve ten companies. Al-
though Colombiana intends to decrease its exposure in most of these companies,
sales of shares are difficult for lack of maturity of the investments and the
thin equity market. Only Colombiana's total exposure in Cales y Cementos de
Toluvitjo (Tolcemento), amounting to 71.7% of the financiera's equity, exceeded



APPENDIX A
Page 3
the second limit as of end 1971.  However, although Colombiana's total exposure
has remained unchanged, the financiera has been able to sell since then most of
its equity investment in the company thereby decreasing loss prospects (see
para. 14). In its earlier years of operations, Colombiana was active in
promoting new enterprises. Since 1967 priority was rightly given to the con-
solidation of portfolio. In 1971, Colombiana played a substantial role in
the promotion and consolidation of Acabados y Estampados Tintorex. Colombiana
is reviewing several investment possibilities, particularly in connection with
markets operated through the Andean Pact, which may lead to equity investments.
10.       Other Pperations.  Together with Valle and IFC, Colombiana partici-
pated in the underwqriting of a Col$8.6 million share issue of Pro-hoteles,.of
which more than 80% has been placed. Colombiana has somewhat decreased its
guarantee operations and commitments. Guarantees outstanding, at the end of
1971 were Col$84.3 million, compared to Col$97.7 million a year earlier, the
drop being largely due to converting guarantees for Tolcemento into loans.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
11.       Borrowings and Resource Position.  In 1971, Colombiana's growth of
total assets was only a modest 7.6%, compared to 13.5% in 1972. The 1971
increase was financed as shown below (in Col$ million):

BR lines continued to be Colombiana's single most important source of finance
and accounted for 30.0% of total resources at the end of 1971. Own equity
although dropping from 21.2% in 1970 to 20.4% of the total, remained second in
importance.  Use of Bank funds increased by a relatively low 13.3%, accounting
for 18.0% of total resources at the end of 1971. Mainly by selling bonds to
institutional investors, who are shareholders of Colombiana, the company has
been the most successful financiera in raising local resources in the bond
market. Although, as of 1971, 13.6% of total resources came from bond place-
ments, Colombiana, like the other financieras, continues to be faced with a
tight local currency position. Ilowever, the five financieras have been making
great effort to raise additional local resources by selling bonds jointly.



APPENDIX A
Page 4
Finally, the increasing utilization of short-term credit lines from foreign
commercial banks reflects wide fluctuations, which have also occurred in the
past, rather than a trend.
12.       Financial Structure.  Historic financial statements, covering fiscal
years 1967-71 (Annex 6), show that Colombiana has maintained a sound overall
financial structure. The financiera's total debt/equity ratio increased from
4.1:1 in 1970, to 4.3:1 in 1971, making allowance for estimated prudent
provisions (see para. 16) in both years, and to 4.6:1 in 1972, thus approaching
the maximum of 5:1, stipulated in the Loan Agreements with the Bank and in
Colombiana's own Policy Statements.  Colombiana's short-term liquidity sit-
uation is satisfactory; short-term assets and the normal monthly cash flow
cover short-term liabilities comfortably.
13.       Income, Expenses and Profitability.  Colombiana's operating results
have been satisfactory. Its net profit increased by 13.8% from Col$31.3 nil-
lion in 1971 to Col$35.6 million in 1972 and return, both on average paid-in
capital (25.6%) and on average equity (13.7%) improved accordingly. The over-
whelming part of Colombiana's income is derived from lending operations. Ad-
ministrative costs continue to be high compared with Nacional, a development
finance company comparable in size and age. Colombiana has, however, built
up a large and competent staff which should be able to handle the expected
substantially larger volume of business in the future.
14.       Quality of Loan and Investment Portfolios.  Colombiana's loan and
guarantee portfolio is intrinsically sound.  Of the year-end 1971 total, more
than two thirds were outstanding to companies operating profitably, over one
quarter to companies operating at a loss (of which Tolcemento accounted for
almost one half), and Col$5.1 million to three companies in liquidation. Total
principal and interest of clients in arrears for more than three months amounted
to Col$43.2 million, whereas the total amount outstanding with these clients
was Col$57.8 million, or 5.3% of the total portfolio of loans and guarantees
extended. Although this is not excessive, Colombiana should continue giving
attention to improving its collection record. Colombiana is well secured
in most cases and apparently has more than ample guarantees for the loans
to companies in liquidation. The financiera's management considers that
Col$8.5 million is adequate to provide for possible losses on doubtful loans.
15.       As of end 1971, the quality of Colombiana's equity portfolio (Annex
5) contained a considerable element of risk, mainly because of the financiera's
substantial and increasing exposure (equal to about three quarters of its own
equity) in Tolcemento, a cement company well known to the Bank Group, which
has incurred increasingly high losses and whose prospects of turning around
do not seem to be clear. Colombiana's auditors qualified their opinion
regarding equity investments of Col$68.7 million, or 39% of the total equity
investments, in six companies in pre-operation or operating at a loss, of
which Tolcemento accounted for almost three quarters. Colombiana's total
year-pnd 1971 exposure (investments plus loans and guarantees) in these



APPENDIX A
Page 5
companies amounted to Col$210.9 million, of which Col$173.2 million referred
to the exposure of Tolcemento. In 1972, however, except for Col$8.7 million,
Colombiana was able to sell its equity investment in Tolcemento at par to a
competing cement producer. As conditions of the sale the financiera had to
convert an additional Col$34.7 million of loans into equity, and to finance
the entire purchasing price of Col$75.2 million at concessionary terms.  As
a result of this transaction 1/ Colombiana's total exposure in Tolcemento
has remained unchanged, but the inherent risk of losses in Colombiana's portfolio
has been substantially reduced, at the fair cost of an interest subsidy which
will affect the financiera's income over the 14-year term of the loan to the
purchaser. Of Colombiana's other large exposures in companies in pre-operation
or operating at a loss, prospects of Grasas del Litoral and Palmeras de la
Costa, both agricultural enterprises, continuing mainly El Labrador's pro-
duction lines, remain unclear. So are the prospects of Tennessee Colombia/
Petroleos Nacionales, operating in the risky field of oil exploration. Pro-
spects of Pro-hoteles and V. Burrowes Industrias are discussed in para. 15
of Appendix C. Overall, with the sale of shares in Tolcemento, Forjas de
Colombia and El Labrador (para. 9) the quality of Colombiana's equity port-
folio has improved. Equity write-offs in 1971-72 were insignificant.
16.       Reserves and Dividend Policy.  Like the other financieras, Colombiana
does not have provisions for portfolio losses. However, the 1971 audit report
separated for the first time from Colombiana's equity reserves for possible
losses of Col$16.3 million 2/, indicating thereby the level of provisions
which, in the opinion of Colombiana's Board, would be sufficient to cover
possible losses on the realization of loans and investments. Excluding this
amount and dividends declared out of 1971 earnings, Colombiana had total
reserves and retained earnings of Col$85.0 million, equivalent to 7.6% of
total loan and equity portfolio; Colombiana allocated 45.4% of 1972 earnings
to reserves. Overall, reserves appear adequate given the present quality of
Colombiana's loan and equity portfolio, but as the financiera grows it should
continue to strengthen its reserves position.
17.       Colombiana's shares are not listed at either of the Colombian stock
exchanges. During 1971, Colombiana placed some 200,000 shares with investors
under the economic development reserve at 125% of par; reported private trans-
actions, however, did not exceed par. This compares with a book value of
160.8% of par at the end of 1971. The low price is a reflection of the
financiera's poor dividend record which, in turn, is a result of the need to
build up substantive portfolio reserves. Since profitability is expected to

2/   Col$8.5 million for doubtful loans and Col$7.8 million for equity
investments.



APPENDIX A
Page 6
continue to improve, Colombiana should be able to gradually increase its
dividends. However, return to investors will probably not become attractive
enough for some time to create a significant market for Colombiana shares.
Out of 1972 earnings, Colombiana declared a 13.2% dividend, representing a
53.4% pay-out, compared to 12% and 53.6%, and 12% and 59.4%, respectively,
in 1971 and 1970. Reflecting a higher level of necessary provisions in 1971,
as indicated by the auditors' report, book value of shares increased only
marginally from 157.8% to 160.7% of par. Earnings per share rose faster,
from Col$2.01 to Col$2.24 and to Col$2.47 in 1972, which, however, is still
low compared to Nacional and Valle.
18.       Foreign Exchange Risk.  In all cases examined by the mission, the
financiera had followed its policy of not incurring the foreign exchange risks.
19.       Audit of Accounts.  Colombiana's accounts are audited annually by
Price Waterhouse & Co. whose 1971 report contains a qualification with respect
to the realization value of approximately Col$68 million in equity investments
(see para. 15).
PROSPECTS
20.       Business Forecasts.  Colombiana's forecasts (Annex 7) of operations
for 1972-76 assume rather modest rates of growth. Local currency loan appro-
vals, after a drop of 431% in 1972 over the unusually high level of approvals
in 1971 (due to Colombiana's very large participation under the last Bank
Loan) are projected to grow at an annual rate of 11% from 1973 to 1976.
Foreign currency loan approvals, mainly import financing in connection with
the last Bank Loan, would increase by 23% in 1972, then level off at an
average annual growth rate of 8%. New equity investments would drop from
Col$51.7 million in 1971 to Col$34.5 million in 1972, mainly in line with
previously made commitments. As no such commitments exist beyond 1972, new
equity investments from 1973 through end 1976 are projected very conservatively
between Col$4.5-5.0 million annually. Considering the expected continuing
strong demand for industrial finance and Colombiana's ample project evaluation
capacity, these projections should be easily attainable, if Colombiana can
obtain the expected resources for financing of equipment imports. Colombiana's
projections also indicate that the financiera intends to further consolidate
its portfolio by taking a conservative approach to equity investments.
21.       Sources of Funds.  The projected increases in resources assume sub-
stantial Bank support as well as fresh funds from PIF, IFF and BR. Colombiana
also expects to use extensivelv foreign commercial bank lines for export-import
financing. Projected commitments of Bank funds are partly based on a pipeline
of projects which are either under study by Colombiana or for which definite
investment proposals are expected. Projected bond placements seem somewhat
conservative. Considering the success of joint bond issues in 1972, Colombiana
should well exceed the projected targets throughout 1976. By attracting sub-
scriptions mainly from Colombian enterprises, Colombiana expects to increase



APPENDIX A
Page 7
its shlare capital by Col$60 million to reach Col$200 million by 1976.  This
may be difficult to achieve. Overall, however, Colombiana's projections
may result to be conservative. Developments in 1972 support this assumption.
22.       Financial Prolections.  In line with its expected business, Colom-
biana's total assets would grow at an annual average rate of about 10%, from
Col$1,186.4 million in 1971 to Col$1,954.1 million in 1976, which compares
wiith annual growth rates of total assets of 7.6%"' in 1971 and 24.2% in 1970.
Since equity investments would expand more slowly than loans--and expected
increases in owm equity--from Col$168.3 million in 1971 to Col$222.3 million
in 1976, Colombiana's equity portfolio as a proportion of its net worth would
decrease from 69.7% in 1971 to 54.6% in 1976. Due to rather substantial capital
increases expected in the period 1972-74, Colombiana's indebtedness would
remain within its present debt/equity limitation of 5:1, even dropping from
4.3:1 in 1971 to 4.1:1 in 1976. As Colonbiana may not be able to raise the
projected additional capital and to provide an incentive for higlher indebted-
ness through local resource mobilization beyond its present limitation on
leverage, Colorbiana's contractual debt/equity ratio would be relaxed to 6:1.
Colombiana's operating experience, the level of its provisions and improvement
of the quiality of its portfolio provide an adequate basis for this increase.
23.       Reserves and retained earnings (including total annual net income)
are expected to increase slightly from 8.6% of total portfolio in 1971 to
10.5% in 197T, which should allow adequate portfolio coverage. Projected
liquidity, expected to improve somewhat, would remain sufficient. Throughout
the forecast period debt-service coverage is projected to remain adequate.
24.       If Colombiana can achieve the expected volume of business and
financial margins, its net profit xwould almost double, from Col$31.3 million
in 1971 to Col$56.5 million in 1976. Rates of returns on average equity would
increase from 13.2% in 1971 to 14.3% ir 1976. Increasing profitability is also
reflected in dividends, expected to rise slowly from 12.0% of par in 1°71 to
15.6% of par in 1976, but within the limits of prudent pay-out ratios not
exceeding 55, of net profits.  Ratios of return on eauity and dividends may
be higher than projected, depending on the actual capital additions. Although
Colombiana expects its administrative costs to increase from 1.5% of average
total assets in 1971 to 1.6% in 1976, the financiera should be able to lower
these costs to a level comparable to the one projected for 1976 by Nacional
and Valle, of 0.9% and 1.3%, respectively.
CONCLIJSIONS AND RECOMfENDATIONS
25.       Colonbiana is the larrest and oldest of the financieras.  Overall,
it has performed creditablv. By providing industrial financing on a national
scale it has made a substantial contribution to Colombia's econoric develop-
ment and has played an important role within Colombia's economy. The leading role
it has taken in promoting enterprises had led to large exposures of consider-
able risk. However, Colombiana has successfully continued its prudent policy



APPENDIX A
Page 8
of consolidation, initiated in 1967. As a result, the financiera has gradually
improved the overall quality of its equity portfolio and its profitability.
26.       Colombiana's competent management has continued to strengthen the
financiera's organization to a rather efficient level. Its ample staff has,
perhaps, the most diversified skills among all financieras. Colombiana's
appraisal work is of good quality, whereas its supervision leaves roonm for
improvement.
27.       Colombiana has made effective use of Bank funds.  Its debt-service
capacity is expected to remain adequate. On the basis of its performance,
the financiera continues to be creditworthy and is a suitable recipient for
the proposed loan. In consideration of Colombiana's operating experience,
the improvement in its performance and the strength of its portfolio and
reserves, it is recommended that the 5:1 debt/equity limitation provided for
in the Subsidiary Loan Agreements under the Bank Loans be relaxed to 6:1,
and that Colombianals Statement of Policies and Procedures be modified ac-
cordingly. Colombiana agreed to include necessary provisions in the debt/equity
ratio computation.

CORPORACION FINANCIERA NACIONAL
INTRODUCTION
1.        Nacional was founded in 1959 and started operating in 1960 in
Medellin, the capital of the Department of Antioquia, which has the second
largest concentration of industry in Colombia. IFC made an investment in
Nacional as early as 1961.
ORGANIZATION
2.        Share Capital and Ownership.  At December 31, 1972, Nacional had
a paid-in share capital of Col$147.0 million, up a substantial Col$17.3
million or 13.3%, from the end of 1971.  Additional subscriptions were mainly
made by existing and new Colombian private shareholders. At year-end 1971
Nacional was owned by 183 shareholders (Annex 1), compared to 146 a year
earlier; with only one stockholder, Banco Comercial Antioqueno, holding more
than 10%. Private Colombian shareholders accounted for 62.8% of this total,
foreign or foreign controlled firms 25.3%, Government bodies 3.7% and IFC
8.2%.
3.        Board of Directors and Management.  Nacional's 10-member Board of
of Directors (Annex 2) seven directors represent Colombian shareholders,
three foreign interests. IFC is not represented. However, Dr. Luis Machado,
IFC's Consultant, has been advisor to Nacional's Board since mid-1971.
Nacional continues to take the most conservative approach of the five fi-
nancieras to development banking, often relying more heavily on security
presented for loans than the merits of project analysis.
4.        No changes have taken place in Nacional's internal management.
Mr. Jose Gutierrez has been the financieras' President since the beginning
of its operations.  He provides the financiera with forceful leadership.  Its
Vice-President is competent and a valuable complement to the President. How-
ever, for a company the size of Nacional, it lacks depth of management. In
particular, employment of a Technical Vice-President is becoming a matter of
priority. Nacional agreed to make beat efforts to fill the vacancy as soon
as possible.
5.        Staff and Internal Organization.  Nacional's organization (Annex
3), is adequate. The financiera's internal system of reporting and controls
seems to be adequate and to work quite well. Nacional's limited staff has
been hard pressed to handle the increasing volume of business. To a large
part Nacional has been able to operate with such a small staff because most
of its clients have been the larger and well-established firms, requiring
little assistance from the financiera to prepare investment proposals. If
Nacional is to reach, to a greater extent than it has in the past, medium-sized
and less well-established firms that may not have the expertise of its present



APPENDIX B
Page 2
clients, the financiera's professional staff will have to be expanded. Nacional
agreed to hire one more financial analyst and one more engineer to strengthen
its appraisal and supervision capacity for the proposed loan.
6.        Appraisal and Follow-up.  The quality of Nacional's appraisal work
has shown some improvement, mainly in the financial and market analysis areas.
Recent project appraisals indicate that Nacional's evaluations have become
more thorough, although it still tends to rely substantially on proposals
received from large and well-established firms with considerable experience.
Nacional has become sufficiently familiar with the effective protection
calculation, a procedure for economic project evaluation which was agreed
upon with the Bank in connection with the last loan. Engineering analysis
remains a deficiency in its appraisal work. Presently, the financiera has
only one engineer with limited experience and insufficient time for thorough
evaluations. In 1971, Nacional as the first and still only financiera em-
ployed an economist to investigate export possibilities for Colombian manu-
factured products as a service for its clients and to evaluate export poten-
tials of investment proposals. Results of this experiment have been encouraging.
7.        Nacional's follow-up work still leaves much to be desired, mmainly
due to professional staff shortages. Supervision is inadequate from a
technical aspect, as emphasis is placed on supervising the credit rather
than the project. In maniy cases there is no formal supervision, simply
reliance on an informal relationship with clients or on the prestige of the
borrower. However, through the presence of major regional banks on its
Board, the proximity of many clients to its headquarters and close informal
contacts between them and its staff, Nacional has been able to close much of
the information gap regarding current financial position and prospects of
clients. The additional staff Nacional intends to employ should bring im-
provement in its supervision.
8.        Procurement and Disbursement Procedures.  Nacional leaves procure-
ment largely to its clients; little checking is done with regard to the
competitiveness of prices or the appropriateness of the equipment. With its
present clientele of largely experienced firms this is not an unreasonable
procedure. However, if Nacional is to expand its financial services more to
medium-sized firms, procurement procedures will have to be markedly strength-
ened. Disbursement procedures are well conceived and provide for adequate
checks, although disbursement control for construction work could be improved
through more frequent site visits.
OPERATIONS
9.        Lending Operations.  At the end of 1971, Nacional's total outstand-
ing loan portfolio was Col$679.8 million, 1/ an advance of 24.7% from a year
earlier. In 1971, it disbursed 300 peso loans, totalling Col$288.9 mmillion,
1/   Total loan and export-import financing portfolio rose to Col$869.8 mil-
lion at the end of 1972.



APPENDIX B
Page 3
a 19.2% increase over 1970 disbursements (Annex 4). Nacional had continued
to concentrate its lending in the Department of Antioquia, where it is
located; the drop from 92.2% to 74.7% of the total lending to this region in
1971 was due to Nacional's participation in several large joint projects with
other financieras. The share of the sub-sectors food, beverages and tobacco,
textiles and apparel and paper and printing further increased to over 60%,
reflecting, in part, the distribution of local manufacturing. In 1971, work-
ing capital financing accounted for 53.3% of the total disbursements and loans
of up to five years for 56.7% of the total, as against 48.8% and 52.9% re-
spectively. This can be explained by Nacional's relatively small participa-
tion under the last Bank loan. As might be expected, given Nacional's con-
servative business approach, as in the past almost all loans disbursed in 1971
were for existing enterprises. Nacional has not felt the need to engage sub-
stantially in short-term export-import financing since management feels that
the financiera should not compete with shareholder banks which adequately meet
existing needs. Outstanding foreign exchange loans increased from US$1.0 mil-
lion to US$1.5 million equivalent in 1971.
10.       Equity Investments and Promotions.  In 1971, Nacional's gross equity
investments (Annex 5) increased somewhat slower than its own equity, by 13.1%
from Col$96.8 million to Col$109.5 million (and to Col$120.0 million at the
end of 1972). Thus, at the end of 1971, equity portfolio came to 53.1% of
Nacional's own equity, down slightly from 54.5% for 1970.  An initial investment
in one company, Comestibles La Rosa, accounted for more than 70% of the 1971
increase. Small initial investments were made in three other companies, and
investments were increased in six firms already in Nacional's equity portfolio.
Nacional sold part of its shares in two firms, Industrias Metalicas de Palmira
at a capital gain of Col$730,000, and Productos Para El Hogar at cost. Ac-
cording to Nacional's Policy Statement, the financiera's equity holding of
an individual firm would normally not exceed 25% of the subscribed capital
of that firm. Nacional has continued to exceed this limit in Electroquimica
Colombiana (45.3%), Industrias Metalicas de Palmira (33.5%), and Ganadera
Nacional (28.6%). All three companies are operating profitably and are paying
dividends; the risk of losses or excessive management involvement seems,
therefore, small.
11.       Nacional's promotional activities since its inception have been
rather limited. None of its investments made in 1971 was in companies pro-
moted predominantly by Nacional. However, indications are that the financiera
may intend to become more promotion-minded, as evidenced by its creation of
in-house capacity to investigate export opportunities for Colombian producers.
In the context of opportunities arising from the Andean Common Market, Nacional
is considering to take the lead in reorganizing and expanding several enter-
prises. The projections foresee a substantial increase of equity investments.
12.       Other Operations.  Nacional has not acted as an underwriter for
securities, which reflects both its conservative business attitude and the
depressed state of the Colombian equity market in recent years. The

financiera extended no new guarantees in 1971; guarantees outstanding re-
mained at an insignificant Col$8 million.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
13.       Borrowings and Resource Position.  During 1971 Nacional's total
assets increased by 22.0% from Col$666.3 million to Col$812.8 million, which
compares to a 27.4% increase, to Col$1,036.3 million in 1972. The 1971 in-
crease was financed as shown below (in Col$ million):

The composition of resources utilized by Nacional has changed relatively
little in 1971. IBRD credit lines have somewhat increased their importance
as Nacional's single most important source of finance, followed closely by
funds provided from BR lines and Nacional's own equity. These three sources
provided almost nine tenths of the total resources. Resources raised through
Nacional's own bonds from institutional investors increased faster than total
resources, but still only provided 2.7% of total resources at the end of 1971.
Nacional's local and foreign currency resource situation, as those of other
financieras, was tight at the end of 1972. Assured resources for term lend-
ing to finance fixed assets lending were practically fully committed, and
local resource availability was essentially limited to funds from BR and re-
payments and cash generation from the financiera's operations. However, the
five financieras have been successful in raising additional local resources
through joint bond issues in 1972.
14.       Financial Structure.  Annex 6 gives summary financial statements
for 1967-71. The financiera's financial structure reflects the conservative
policy of management, as Nacional has been operating well within its 5:1 debt/
equity limitation. Leverage on equity has increased only slightly from 2.6:1
in 1970 to 2.9:1 in 1971 and 3.1:1 in 1972. The 1971 ratio remains unchanged
even if allowance is made for prudent provisions (see para. 18). The propor-
tion of equity portfolio to total portfolio has declined slightly, reflecting
management interest in lending operations, and was equal to 13.9% of total
portfolio ccompared to 15.1% a year earlier. Although its current ratio
decreased somewhat during 1971, from 1.6:1 to 1.4:1, Nacional has maintained
good iiquidity.

15.       Income, Expenses and Profitability.  Nacional receives a larger
return on its equity than any of the other financieras. Return on equity
investments increased from 11.6% to 12.6% of average equity portfolio con-
tributing a satisfactory 10.2% and 10.3%, respectively, to total income.
Nacional continues to be the most profitable financiera in absolute and in
relative terms. Net profit increased from Col$30.4 million in 1970 to
Col$36.9 million in 1971 and Col$43.5 million in 1972. Profit before tax
on average total assets rose from 6.9% to 7.0%, and net profit on average
share capital increased from 28.3% to 30.0% and 31.4% in 1972. Increased
profitability is mainly due to higher leverage and a further cut-down of
administrative cost to 1.0% of average total assets, by far the lowest
among the financieras.
16.       Quality of Loan and Investment Portfolio.  Nacional's loan portfolio
is sound with arrearage continuing to be minimal. As of end 1971, principal
and interest in arrears for more than three months involving three clients
amounted to Col$1.5 million; the total outstanding with these clients in ar-
rears was Col$20.2 million, equivalent to 3.0% of the financiera's total loan
portfolio. By mid-1972, two of these clients had completely repaid their
loans and the third one was paying regularly. In no case does Nacional's
total exposure to any firm exceed 18% of its own equity. Loans are heavily
concentrated in two industrial sub-sectors, food, beverages and tobacco, and
textiles and apparels; but given their past performance and future prospects,
Nacional's concentration in these sub-sectors does not diminish the high
quality of its loan portfolio. Nacional refinanced no loans during 1971.
Management expects no significant losses from the financiera's loan portfolio.
17.       Nacional's equity portfolio (Annex 5) totalling Col$109.5 million
is of high quality, with about nine-tenths of the total in companies operating
at a profit. Of the 29 companies in which Nacional has holdings, 22 are operat-
ing at a profit, three in development or pre-operating stages, and four are
operating at a loss. Except for Forjas, which is in the process of liquida-
tion, the financiera expects no losses. Of the companies in development or
operating at a loss, prospects of the oil exploration company Petroleos
Nacionales remain unclear; Promotora de Hoteles de Turismo is operating an
international hotel in Medellin. At present it suffers fron insufficient cash
flow, due to low rates of occupancy, but the hotel is expected to be viable
in the long run. Nacional's investments are concentrated in seven companies
which account for 70.4% of its equity portfolio. All these companies, except
for Forjas, are operating profitably.
18.       Reserves and Dividend Policy.  Like the other financieras, Nacional
has no specific provisions for portfolio losses. However, in the 1971 audit,
the auditors did not include in the financiera's equity the Col$7.4 million
reserve for losses on investments, practically equal to its total investment
in Forjas, thus indicating the level of provisions which in the opinion of
Nacional's management would be sufficient to cover possible losses from equity
portfolio. Given the outstanding quality of Nacional's loan portfolio, no



APPENDIX B
Page 6
provisions for losses from it seem necessary at this time. At the end of
1971, excluding the above estimated provisions and dividends declared out of
1971 earnings, Nacional had total reserves of Col$63.5 million, equivalent
to 8.3% of total loan and equity portfolio. This is adequate given the good
quality of the portfolio.
19.       Following a dividend policy which gives high priority to making the
financiera's shares marketable above par and raising investors' interest in
them, Nacional has achieved the best dividend record of all financieras. Its
shares are the only financiera stock traded on the Colombian stock exchanges.
Due to the recently depressed state of the stock market, however, trading in
Nacional's shares was very thin and prices (120% of par for latest known trans-
action in August 1972), were substantially below book value, in spite of com-
petitive dividends. Out of 1972 earnings a 22.8% dividend was declared,
equivalent to a 77%, profit pay-out, following a 21.6% dividend and a 76% pay-
out ratio for 1971. These high pay-outs have been prudent in the light of
the high quality of the financiera's portfolio and its adequate reserves.
Mainly as a result of the substantial capital increase in 1921, book value
of shares increased only marginally from 148.77 to 150.8%, and earnings per
share, from Col$2.91 to Col$3.09.
20.       Foreign Exchange Risk.  All operations reviewed by the mission in-
dicate that the financiera is not exposed to the risk of incurring foreign
exchange losses.
21.       Audit of Accounts.  The financiera's accounts are audited annually
by Price W4aterhouse and Co., whose opinion for 1971 was given without quali-
fication.
PROSPECTS
22.       Business Forecasts.  In its 5-year forecasts (Annex 7), Nacional
has used a realistic approach, basing its assumptions mainly on expected
overall demand for industrial finance and on the financiera's long-term
historic growth. Consequently, annual growth of its local currency approvals
(including Bank funds relent in pesos) would average about 16% throughout
1974 and about 25% in 1975-76 on the basis of a relatively low level of
approvals of Col$347.1 million in 1971. Projected foreign currency operations
are about in line with this growth. Nacional intends to increase its equity
investments substantially; an average annual growth of 26.5% throughout 1976
on the basis of Col$17.7 million in 1971 seems attainable. These projections
indicate Nacional's expectation of a continuing and increasingly high demand
for industrial finance. Unaudited 1972 results indicate that Nacional may be
able to do somewhat becter than projected.
23.       Sources of Funds.  Nacional expects substantial Bank support for
its operations the need for which is based partly on a pipeline of projects
already under consideration. Substantial resources are also expected to come
from -'F and other BR funds and through discounting operations with IFI. The
largest volume of funds, however, is projected to come from repayments, port-
folio sales and share capital increases. Given past experience, this appears



APPENDIX B
Page 7
reasonable. Reflecting a continuation of its past policy, utilization of
foreign commercial bank lines for export-import financing operations is ex-
pected to have less importance than in case of the other financieras.
Nacional is conservative in its assumptions regarding future bond placements.
Considering the success of joint bond issues in 1972, the financiera should
well exceed the expected sales of Col$149.0 million throughout 1976.
24.       Financial Projections.  As a result of the expected operations,
total assets would grow from Col$812.8 million in 1971 to Col$1,508.4 million
in 1974, at an annual growth rate of 22.7%, practically equal to the annual
growth expected throughout 1976, with growth of loan portfolio exceeding
these rates. Equity investments amounting to Col$109.5 million at end 1971
are expected to expand more slowly to Col$125.3 million in 1974 and Col$147.8
million by 1976, reflecting higher levels of new com=itments but also a
faster rotation of portfolio than in the past. Equity portfolio thus would
equal 44.3% and 39.8% of Nacional's net xorth in 1974 and 1976, respectively,
compared to 53.1%, at the end of 1971. Due to the expected substantial
annual increases of capital, Nacional's indebtedness would remain well within
its present debt/equity limitation of 5:1. However, as outlined above,
Nacional's growth assumptions are conservative and a higher debt/equity ratio
would be an incentive to raise more funds, particularly local resources. The
good quality of Nacional's portfolio and its operational record support re-
leasing its contractual debt/equity limitation to 6:1.
25.       Total reserves and retained earnings (net of dividends) are pro-
jected to rise from Col$63.5 million in 1971 to Col$99.8 million in 1974 and
Col$143.7 million in 1976. However, reserves and retained earnings are ex-_
pected to drop from 8.3% of total portfolio in 1971 to 6.5% in 1976. If the
present high quality of portfolio does not deteriorate substantially, these
proportions should allow more than adequate portfolio coverage. Throughout
the forecast period expected liquidity and debt service coverage are adequate.
Nacional's projections show that the financiera expects financial costs to
grow faster than income. Administrative costs are expected to be kept rather
low with an average of 0.8% of total assets but may well be somewhat higher
if Nacional gets increasingly involved in financing smaller clients.
26.       If projected volume of business and margins materialize, net pro-
fit would grow 20.0% annually from Col$36.9 million in 1971 to Col$91.7
million in 1976, with the return on average share capital increasing from
30.0% to 46.0%. The higher profitability is reflected in higher dividends,
expected to rise from 21.6% in 1971 to 28.8%7 in 1976, at pay-out ratios de-
clining from 75.9% to 65.6%. Due to these relatively high, but acceptable
pay-outs and the substantial capital increases expected, book value of shares
would increase only marginally, from 150.8% to 168.8% of par.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
27.       Operating for more than one decade, Nacional has established an
impressive record of growth, profits and sound investment decisions. The



APPENDIX B
Page 8
financiera has followed a policy aiming at a high level of profits, estab-
lishment of a good dividend record and selectivity in its clientele, geared
to finance mainly investment proposals of established and profitable
enterprises. These policies have been effective insofar as they have made
the financiera the most profitable of the Colombian financieras and the only
one whose shares are traded at the stock exchange. Under the guidance of
forceful and effective top management, Nacional has concentrated on financing
existing clients, mainly in the Department of Antioqula, many of which are
amonp the leaders of industrialization in Colombia. By strengthening these
clients, Nacional has made a substantial contribution to Colombia's economic
growth.
28.       The financiera's environment, although it has been conducive for
business, also has produced a tendency to rely excessively on studies pre-
pared by its larger customers. However, recently Nacional has made progress
in upgrading its own appraisal work. Depth of management and staffing
have not fully followed Nacional's growth. Nacional agreed to improve this
aspect of its operations, as well as its appraisal and follow-up work.
29.       The quality of both Nacional's loan and equity investment portfolios
is considerable. Its reserves position is good. So has been its financial
performance. It has made effective use of its resources. Its future pros-
pects are good. The projected debt-service capacity is sufficient. Nacional
is creditworthy and is a suitable recipient for further Bank funds.
30.       Considering the good quality of Nacional's portfolio, the finan-
ciera's ample experience and impressive operating record, it is recommended
that the debt/equity limit set in the Subsidiary Loan Agreements and the Bank
Loans be increased from its present 5:1 to 6:1 and that Nacional's Statement
of Policies and Procedures be modified accordingly. Only equity net of pro-
visions will be included in the debt/equity computation.

CORPORACION FINANCIERA DEL VALLE
INTRODUCTION
1.        Valle was established in 1961 and began operations in 1962.  The
financiera seeks primarily to further the economic development of the Cauca
Valley, one of Colombia's main agricultural areas. IFC became a shareholder
in 1969.
ORGANIZATION
2.        Share Capital and Ownership.  Valle increased its capital 15.5%
from Col$99.5 million to Col$115.0 million in 1971 and to Col$130.0 mil-
lion in 1972, largely through additional subscriptions by existing share-
holders. The composition of ownership (Annex 1) therefore showed little
change. As of end 1971, Valle was widely owqned by 187 stockholders, none
of which held more than 10% of the total; Colombian private shareholders
had 68.2%, two autonomous Government shareholders -- 6.2%, foreign and
foreign-controlled shareholders - 19.1% and IFC, 6.5%.
3.        Board of Directors and Management.  Valle's Board (Annex 2), con-
sisting of ten principals and their alternates, was elected on March 6, 1972
for a two-year period. The Board includes seven representatives of Colombian
shareholders, two of foreign shareholders and Mr. Justo Garcia-Rayneri, rep-
resenting IFC. The Board has continued to meet weekly, with only the local
members attending regularly, and to take a strong interest in the financiera's
operations.
4.        Mr. Benjamin Martinez, a former Vice President of the financiera,
has been Valle's President since 1967. His competence and dynamic personality
have been important factors in Valle's rapid growth.  He is assisted by two
able Vice Presidents.
5.        Staff and Internal Organization.  Valle has improved and strength-
ened its organization (Annex 3). The various units in its organization are
adequately staffed. Valle's internal supervision and reporting is commend-
able. Despite considerable staff turnover, Valle's Technical Department now
has a sufficient staff of capable and experienced economists and engineers.
6.        Appraisal and Follow-up.  Valle's appraisal work has reached a com-
mendable level among the financieras. Most project evaluations adequately
cover all important aspects, including economic analysis. The financiera has
quickly become familiar with the effective protection calculation, which it
introduced under the last Bank loan. Project supervision does not quite reach
the quality of appraisal work. It concentrates too much on Valle's equity
investments and problem clients and Valle has not always followed its general
policy of visiting clients twice a year. Ianagement has indicated that it



APPENDIX C
Page 2
would now upgrade and emphasize more systematic and freouent follow-up.  In
connection with evaluations of investment proposals and project supervision,
Valle often provides its clients with valuable technical assistance.
7.        Procurement and Disbursement Procedures.  Valle, like other finan-
cieras, only requires its customers to show evidence of having requested
several offers in the case of large projects involving imports of machinery
a,nd equipment. If these quotations leave any doubt or if the investment is
very substantial Valle itself may seek quotations from suppliers. For foreign
currencv disbursements, procedures and checks are thorough.  However, when
disbursements involve site visits and other forms of follow-up (as in most
local currency disbursements), although the documentation required is appro-
priate, control could be strengthened through more frequent contacts with
the client.
OPLRATTONS
8.        Lending Operations.  Loans denominated in pesos, including Bank
loans, form the main part of Valle's operations. Peso loans committed reached
Col$378.4 million in 1971, up 19% from the previous year; loan disbursements
(Annex 4) increased by over one third, from Col$254.8 million to Col$343.8
million, largely due to increasing utilization of Bank and PIF funds. Valle
has continued to concentrate its lending on enterprises located in the Cauca
Valley region, which received more than three quarters of the funds disbursed.
Industrial lending accounted for 92% of the total. Valle's lending pattern,
with 29% to food, beverages and tobacco sectors, 20% for textiles and apparel,
and almost the same percentage for metals and engineering, reflects the indus-
trial structure of the Cauca Valley. Working capital financing still con-
stituted over 50%, and loans of up to five years, 69% of total Ainancing, but
the trend towards a larger portion of fixed asset financing at longer terms
has continued. Valle's foreign exchange financing, mainly short-term export
and import financing, has only grown slowly, from US$5.8 million to US$6.0
million eqtuivalent due to increasing comnetition from commercial banks.
9.        Equity Investments and Promotions.  Valle's equity portfolio had
increased onlv marginally, from Col$31.7 million in 1970 to Col$33.6 mil-
lion in 1971 and an estimated Col$41.4 million in 1972 taking up only 18.6%
of its oTm year-end 1971 equity as against 21.1% in 1970.  The 1971 increase
in its investment portfolio was largely due to a new investment in Celanese
Colombiana and additional investments in Industria Nacional de Repuestos,
Consorcio Pesquero Colombiano and Pro-hoteles. At the same time, Valle
sold holdings in Tennessee Colombia, Siderurgica del Pacifico and Nylon de
Colombia, at an average capital gain exceeding 50% of cost.  In the recent
past, Valle has not been particularly active in equity investment and pro-
motional activities, as it has concentrated its efforts on consolidation of,
and technical assistance to existing investments. Valle intends to become
more promotion-minded in future and sees good investment prospects as a result
of the Andean Common Market. Valle is noxw studying several possible promotions



APPENDIX C
Page 3
in the food processing field, mainly for exports and in production of building
materials. It has studied and intends to implement two projects for a metal
foundry and for production of electric meters. In 1972, Valle was the leader
in establishing a savings and loan association the main purpose of which is
to support housing activities in the Cauca Valley.
10.       Other Operations.  Valle participated, together with Colombiana and
IFC, in the underwriting of a Col$8.6 million share issue of Pro-hoteles. The
financiera has continued its policy of limiting its guarantee operations;
guarantees outstanding increased only from Col$25.9 million to Col$26.6 mil-
lion in 1972.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
11.       Borrowings and Resource Position.  During 1971, Valle's total assets
showed a sharp increase, from Col$622.1 million to Col.$604.1 million, 1/ which
was financed as follows (in Col$ million):

Other                             38.9      6.3       68.5      8.5      29.6   16.2
Total liabilities and equity  622.1   100.0         804.1    100.0    182.0  100.0
The 29% increase in Valle's total assets was financed by a blend of additional
resources.  Growth of Bank funds, however, mainly due to substantial disburse-
ments under Bank Loan 625-CO, was most rapid and, apart from the credit lines
extended through BR, Bank funds have become the single most important source
of finance, accounting for 23.2% of the total in 1971, as against 16.7% a year
earlier. Valle has also received continuing support from shareholders in
the form of new share capital and has utilized substantial short-term credit
lines from foreign commercial banks for export-import financing. The relative
importance of funds from BR, from commercial banks, and own equity, however,
has continued to decline. As of end 1971, bonds, although growing at a
higher rate than total assets, still account for only 3.4% of total resources,
indicating that Valle, as well as the other financieras, will have to make
substantial efforts to increase local resource mobilization. The five
financieras initiated joint bond issues in 1972 which have been rather suc-
cessful. At the end of 1971, Valle's assured resources for financing of

fixed assets were practically fully committed, and available local resources
were practically limited to funds from BR and cash generation from Valle's
operations.
12.       Financial Structure.  Valle's 1967-71 financial statements are given
in Annex 6. They show that Valle's overall financial structure is sound.
Despite relatively substantial increases in capital (Col$15.5 million) and
equity (Col$29.9 million) the total debt/equity ratio increased significantly
from 3.3:1 to 3.7:1 in 1971 - and to 4.0:1 if allowance is made for prudent
provisions (see para. 16) -- indicating the need for Valle to continue its
efforts to strengthen its equity base. Valle's debt/equity ratio rose to
3.9:1 in 1972 (without allowing for necessary provisions). Valle has followed
a policy of maintaining sufficient liquidity.
13.       Income, Expenses and Profitability.  The steady increase in leverage
and in volume of operations has enabled Valle to improve its profits, both
in absolute amounts, from Col$22.5 million in 1970 to Col$27.0 million and
Col$32.0 million in the following years, and relative to its paid-in capital.
Net income as percentage of average net worth declined slightly to 16.3%,
due to the considerable increase in equity in 1972. Most of Valle's income
is from lending operations; dividend income dropped from 3.6% to 3.1% of
average equity portfolio in 1971. The following shows the development of
Valle's income and expens2s as percentage of average total assets during
the last five years:
1967    1968    1969    1970    1971
Gross income                      12.3    12.3    12.6    14.8    14.8
Financial expenses                 4.1      4.8     5.5      7.0     7.8
Gross spread                       8.2      7.5     7.1      7.8      7.0
Administrative expenses            2.2      1.9     1.6      1.6      1.5
Profit before tax                  6.0      5.6     5.5      6.2      5.5
Tax                                2.3      2.2     1.9      2.0      1.6
Profit after tax                   3.7      3.4     3.6      4.0      3.9
As Valle has relied increasingly on more expensive borrowed resources, and
has increased its leverage, higher financial costs have reduce<- its overall
spread. This has been only partly counteracted by a relative decrease in
administrative costs; their level of 1.5% (1.7% in 1972) of average assets
about equals that of Colombiana, but is still far above the 1.0% for Nacional.
14.       Quality of Loan and Investment Portfolios.  Valle's loan port-
folio is basically sound. At year-end 1971, 57% was lent to companies
operating profitably, a comparatively high 35% to companies under con-
struction or in pre-operating stages, 8% to companies operating at a loss
or in technical or financial difficulties; and only one loan of Col$875,000,
to a comrany in liquidation. Total principal and interest in arrears for
more than three months, by 11 companies operating at a loss or in technical
or f-.aincial difficulties, and one in liquidation, anount to Col$9.6 million.
The total amount outstanding w-ith these clients was Col$32.7 m.illion, or
>4.5% of Valle's total loan portfolio. Valle is generally sufficiently secured.



APPENDIX C
Page 5
Managerent considers that no significant losses will be incurred in the col-
lection of loans receivable.
15.       The situation of Valle's equity portfolio (Annex 5) is somewhat less
favorable. The a-uditors qualified their opinion for 1971, since almost two
thirds of Valle's equity investments (totalling Col$33.6 million) are in com-
panies in pre-operating stages or operating at a loss. Valle expects write-
offs totalling Col$2.2 million of investments in two companies in liquidation.
Of Valle's larger exposures in companies in pre-operation or operating at a
loss, Consorcio Pesquero Colombiano is in a tight liquidity situation as a
result of substantial cost overruns, but is expected to turn around in 1972,
when the fish processing plant is scheduled to start operations. Sucroquimica
Colombiana/Sucromiles, a Valle promotion which has not yet started efficient
production due to technical difficulties, has recently been reorganized. Its
prospects are now considered good. Industria Nacional de Repuestos (IMCABE)
paid dividends in 1970, but suffered a substantial loss in 1971, when the
Govearnment permitted large imports of shock-absorbers, its main product. Con-
sequently, 121CADE's debt had to be refinanced. However, the company should
regain its profitability if future imports of its main product are kept at
a low level, as expected. Empaques del Cauca has been hampered by personnel
and markrwting problems; its prospects are unclear. Serious financial and
marketing problems of V. Burrows - Industrias El Fraile have reappeared;
results of a reorganization to reduce high production costs ,till have to
be seen. Pro--hoteles, owning an international hotel in Cali in which IFC
is a shareholder, is suffering from an insufficient cash flow in its early
stage of operations and may not become profitable before 1975.
16.       Reserves and Dividend Policy.  Valle, like the other financieras,
has no provision for portfolio losses. Reserves of Col$7.4 million for losses
on equity investments and of Col$6.7 million for doubtful debts seem suffi-
cient, given the present size and quality of Valle's portfolio, but ought to
be built up as it grows. As of end 1971, estimated Col$13.2 million 1/ of
these reserves were needed to provide for realistically estimated loss pos-
sibilities. At end 1971, the financiera's total reserves and unappropriated
surplus (net of 1971 dividends, but including legal reserves of Col$19.8
million which can only be used to absorb annual net losses) a.tounted to
Col$47.8 million, equivalent to 6.3% of total loan and equity portfolios.
17.       Valle's shares are not yet listed on either of the Colombian stock
exchanges. To increase attractiveness of its shares and to build up a divi-
dend record for possible future listing, Valle has continued its policy of
increasing dividends while making prudent allocations to reserves. Valle
declared a 16.8% dividend ouit of 1972 earnings, representing a 68.3% pay-out,
compared to 14.4% and 61.5% respectively, in 1971. Reflecting the substantial
capital increase in 1971, book value of shares increased only slightly, from
156.0% to 164.5% of par, and earnings per share, from Col$2.34 to Col$2.46.
1/   Includes the total Col$7.4 million reserve for equity investments.  Given
the satisfactory quality of Valle's loan portfolio a provision of 1% of
the total ofoutstanding loans, equivalent to Col$5.8 million can be
considered adequate for doubtful loans.



APPENDIX C
Page 6
1&.       Foreign Exchange Risk.  All operations reviewed by the mission in-
dicate that the financiera is not exposed to the risk of incurring foreign
exchange losses.
19.       Audit of Accounts.  Valle is audited annually by Price Waterhouse &
Co., whose 1971 report contains a qualification regarding the realization
value of Col$21.7 million in equity investments (see para. 15).
PROSPECTS
20.       Business Forecasts.  Valle's forecasts of operations (Annex 7) assume
a 14.3% average annual growth of local currency approvals (including Bank funds
in pesos) from their already rather high Col$482.5 million level in 1971, and
an even steeper rate of growth of foreign currency approvals, through 1976.
During the forecast period, annual equity investments would rise rapidly from
a very low Col$3.1 million in 1971, to Col$27.8 million in 1976. These
projections indicate that Valle expects the demand for financing to remain
high, as it sees the volume of its business mainly determined by the avail-
ability of resources. Considering Valle's rapid growth in the past, the
expected continuing strong demand for funds and Valle's good appraisal
capacity, the financiera's projections are realistic, overall, and should be
attainable if it can obtain sufficient resources for financing of equipment
imports (mainly expected rrom the Bank). Growth in 1972 did not fully reach
projections for that year. Projected commitments of Bank funds are supported
by a well-defined pipeline of projects under consideration by Valle.
21.       Sources of Funds.  The projected increases in resources assume very
substantial Bank support, as well as fresh funds from PIF, IFF and BR. Bond
placements of ColS117 million through 1976 seem rather conservative and
Valle should substantially exceed this target. The financiera also expects
to use foreign commercial bank lines extensively for export-import financing.
The financiera intends to continue its great efforts to increase its capital
base. It was quite successful in placing Col$15.5 million new shares in 1971,
and Col$15 million in 1972. Annual increases of Col$15 million are assumed
through 1976, which seems attainable.
22.       Financial Projections.  As a result of the projected operations,
growth of total assets could level off from 41.3% in 1972, to 24.2% in 1973,
and 19.8% in 1974, compared to the 32.3% annual average growth during the last
three years. Despite the substantial capital increases expected, Valle's
indebtedness would grow faster than its equity. Consequently, the financiera
would exceed its present 5:1 debt/equity limitation in 1973, but remain below
6:1 throughout the forecast period.  To provide the necessary additional lever-
age for its operations it is recommended to release Valle's present contractual
debt/eauitv limit to 6:1. The overall good quality of Valle's portfolio, and
the financiera's experience and good record of operations argue for this
relaxation.
23.       Valle's reserves and surplus (including total annual net income)
are projected to drop from 8.8% of total portfolio in 1971, to 5.4% in 1972,



APPENDIX C
Page 7
but then to increase gradually to 7.1%°o in 1976. Valle might consider to build
up reserves faster than projected. Liquidity, although decreasing, should be
adequate through 1975, but might be somewhat tight in 1976.  Projected debt-
service coverage is sound throughout the forecast period.
24.       At the expected volume of business and financial margins, net in-
come would grow 23% annually from Col$27 million in 1971, to Col$77 million
in 1976, and rates of return on average equity would increase from 16.4%, to
24.0%. Accordingly, Valle intends to increase its dividends gradually from
14.4% of par in 1971, to a more attractive 20.4% of par in 1976, but within
the limits of prudent payout ratios not exceeding 58% of net profits. Ad-
ministrative costs are expected to decrease from 1.5% of average total assets
in 1971 to 1.3% in 1976, which, although above Macional's ratio, would be a
reasonablc cost level.
COICLUSIONS A?ID REC0IThlDJATIONS
25.       Valle has been growing quite rapidly.  Under competent and dynamic
management it has been perforning well and carrying out a useful role in fi-
nancing industrial development projects, mainly of the Cauca Valley region.
Valle's appraisal work has reached a commendable level among the financieras,
but room rem.ains to make its supervision activities more systematic and thor-
oiigh.
26.       Valle's portfolio is sound, overall.  Reserves, though sufficient,
need to be built up further as portfolio grows. Its financial prospects for
doing this are good. Valle has used Bank funds efficiently and could be ex-
pected to continue doing so. Debt-service coverage is projected to remain
sound throughout the forecast period. Valle is thus a suitable recipient of
Bank funds.
27.       In consideration of the good quality of Valle's portfolio, its
operating experience and record and its present and projected soundness of
debt-service coverage, it is recommended that the 5:1 debt/equity limit set
in the Subsidiary Loan Agreements under the Bank loans be relaxed to 6:1, and
that Valle's Statement of Policies and Procedures be modified accordingly.
Valle agreed to include necessary provisions for purposes of the debt/equity
ratio computation.

CORPORACION FINANCIERA DE CALDAS
INTRODUCTION
1.        Caldas was founded in 1961 and started operations in Manizales
the following year. It was promoted with the help of the Federacion
Nacional de Cafeteros (Federacion), the Banco Cafetero and local interests,
with the primary purpose of diversifying the economy of the region, Colom-
bia's main coffee-growing center. IFC became a shareholder in 1964.
2.        Because of financial difficulties and organizational shortcomings,
Caldas' access to the last Bank financiera loan (742-CO) was conditioned
upon satisfactory completion of requirements specified in the Subsidiary
Loan Agreement. In summary, Caldas was expected to furnish satisfactory
cash flow projections for 1971-75; borrow at least the equivalent of
US$4 million from the Federacion on satisfactory terms; protect itself
against foreign exchange risk; increase its paid-in capital by Col$20
million; improve its internal operations and control of investments; and
achieve a financial position satisfactory to the Bank. Based on the find-
ings of a mission to Caldas in July 1971, the Bank determined that Caldas
had satisfactorily met the requirements and, on September 28, 1971, ad-
vised Caldas of its eligibility to use the loan.
ORGANIZATION
3.        Share Capital and Ownership.  After a Col$19.8 million capital
increase in 1971, Caldas' paid-in share capital reached Col$116.2 million
at year-end 1971; it remained virtually unchanged in 1972. As the Federa-
cion bought almost all the new shares, it increased its position as the
largest shareholder from 21.5% to 42.4% of the shares (Annex 1). Banco
Cafetero held 11.6%, while 231 private Colombian shareholders owned another
17.2%; three Colombian official institutions, 8.5%; five foreign shareholders,
11.8%; and IFC, 8.5%.
4.        Board of Directors and Management.  Caldas' oard (see Annex 2)
has seven directors, comprising bankers, lawyers, industrialists, and re-
presentatives of the Federacion. With the reduction in the size of the board
from eleven to seven and with the institution of weekly meetings, both a part
of new policies following the Bank's advice, management has been made account-
able to the board (a former deficiency); and there is a good working re-
lationship between board and management. Dr. Luis Machado is IFC's
representative on the board.
5.        Taking over in November 1970 at a time of crisis, Mr. Eduardo
Arango has done a good job as President of Caldas, within the severe
financial and organizational limitations he has had to operate. His
personality and leadership have apparently restored confidence in Caldas



APPENDIX D
Page 2
within the local business community and on the part of the shareholders.
Management has had to dedicate most of its time to companies with opera-
tional difficulties that represent a substantial part of Caldas' invest-
ment portfolio. In addition to an administrative vice-president who works
closely with Mr. Arango, Caldas recently hired a technical vice-president
to supervise the relatively unexperienced staff. Annex 3 shows Caldas'
Organization.
6.        Staff and Internal Organization.  In April 1972, Caldas' opera-
Jional staff, consisting of the head of the credit and investment division,
two engineers and one financial analyst, was too limited in number as well
as in quality to perform appraisals and follow up adequately on Caldas'
complex portfolio.  Since then, Caldas hired two financial analysts, an
accountant and a part-time financial advisor. Caldas has agreed to strengthen
its staff to improve its appraisal and supervision capacity in connection with
the proposed loan.
7.        Appraisal and Follow-up.  As Caldas' limited staff had to con-
centrate its efforts on the larger companies in Caldas' investment portfolio
operating with difficulties, appraisal work was neglected and its appraisals
were particularly deficient in market and financial analysis. Caldas also
had difficulty in calculating the effective rate of protection. The mission
discussed with management and staff improvements of appraisal work, but
implementation required staff additions. Shortage of staff also made it
impossible to implement _ sound supervision program. The hiring of a
technical vice-president and additional staff since April 1972 have enhanced
substantially Caldas' appraisal and follow-up capacity.
8.        Procurement and Disbursement Procedures.  Caldas, like the other
financieras, relies largely on its customers for proper equipment selec-
tion. It urges them, however, to procure equipment from the most competi-
tive sources available to them and, at least for larger projects, Caldas
tries to establish whether the cost of equipment selected is reasonable.
This aspect of Caldas' operations, as well as its disbursement system, is
satisfactory.
OPERATIONS
9.        Lending Operations.  Local currency commitments (Anrex 4) de-
creased by 35%, from Col$97.5 million in 1970 to Col$63.3 nilliJn in 1971,
reflecting the more cautious attitude of the new management. Most of the
lending (70%) has, as in the past, gone to manufacturing, with chemicals
and textile/apparel receiving the largest share; the remainder (30%) went
to mining, agriculture and other sectors. In 1971, terms and the propor-
tion of fixed asset financing changed somewhat. Loans with maturities
of more than five years dropped from 59% in 1970 to 35%; while loans for
fixed assets decreased from 35% to 24%. Indications are that this tendency
has reversed in 1972. During 1971, 7% of approvals were for new projects



APPENDIX D
Page 3
as compared to 14% in 1970. The fact that the average size of Caldas' loans
has increased gradually, from Col$793 thousand in 1970, to Col$904 thousand
in 1971, and that in 1971, 63% of the lending went to the Caldas' region,
as compared to 98% in 1970, is largely due to more frequent participation of
Caldas in larger joint projects with the financieras, and projects of the
financieras channeled to Caldas to use its pre-allocation.
10.       Equity Investments and Promotions.  At year-end 1971, Caldas'
equity portfolio of 50 companies, amounting to Col$118.4 million 1/ valued
at cost was larger than Caldas' own net worth of Col$94.9 million. The
highly promotional character of Caldas' past operations has changed since
its Board adopted in April 1971 policy guidelines, complementary to its
policy statement, providing that no new project should be promoted until
Caldas' financial position has improved. Since that time Caldas has not made
any new equity investments, although during 1971 it converted Col$6.2 million
worth of loans to equity, and a further Col$5.1 million in 1972. During 1973,
partly following prior coumitments, Caldas expects to convert Col$11.8 million
worth of loans to equity. Conversion of debt to equity is justifiable in
cases of companies that show reasonable prospects of becoming profitable.
While some of the conversions resulted from prior commitments, Caldas also
converted debt to equity of marginal companies rather than liquidate them.
While it is difficult to clearly establish the prospects of each of these
companies Caldas should try to minimize these conversions, since the companies
in most trouble are highly leveraged, and have severe working capital shortages,
implying mounting needs for equity and loan funds (see paras. 13 and 25).
11.       To provide liquidity, and attempting to keep the equity portfolio
from exceeding its own net worth, during 1971 Caldas sold Col$10.3 million
worth of shares from its portfolio, and a further Col$26.0 million worth of
shares in 1972. Caldas' equity portfolio is now lower than Caldas' own equity,
taking into account the convertibility of the Pederacion's loan. (See paras.
19 and 25).
12.       Other Operations.  In addition to its regular investment opera-
tions, Caldas finances letters of credit and exports and provides guarantees
for some of its borrowers. At the end of 1971, letter of credit and export
financing outstanding amounted to Col$24.1 million and guarantees to
Col$42.6 million.
13.       Policies.  Caldas is at odds with two provisions of its policy
statement. First, Caldas' exposure in Derivados del Azufre/Quimica
Suramericana, equivalent to 27% of own equity, exceeds its 25% policy
1/ Net of minimum provisions necessary for losses on loan and equity port-
folios of Co.$18.1 million and Co.$13.3, respectively (see para. 15).



APPENDIX D

limit. Although in the short run Caldas probably cannot reduce its ex-
posure in the company it should at least try to avoid any further increase.
Second, Caldas' shareholdings are in several cases in excess of the 25%
policy limit of the companies' total voting shares, to which Caldas would
normally limit itself. However, since these are mainly holdings in prob-
lem companies, it may be impossible for Caldas to reduce these holdings in
the short run. To adhere more closely to its additional policy guidelines
Caldas has improved its financial planning, appraisal and follow-up capacity.
INANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
14.       Borrowings and Resource Position.  The composition of Caldas'
resources changed as follows during 1971 (in Col$ million):
December 31, 1970         December 31, 1971    Percent
% of                     % of        Increase/
Amount    Total          Amount    Total        Decrease
IBRD                   48.3       11.4           53.0       12.5          9.7
Own Equity             90.4       21.4           94.9       22.5          5.0
BR Lines              109.1       25.8          126.8       30.1         16.2
Foreign commercial
banks                 46.0       10.9           22.8        5.4        (51.4)
Bonds                  16.4        3.9           10.1        2.4        (38.4)
Fed. Nac. de
Cafeteros             65.3       15.4           65.3       15.5           -
Other                  47.2       11.2           49.0       11.6          1.6
Total Liabilities
and equity          422.7      100.0          421.9      100.0        ( 0.2)
Reflecting the consolidation of Caldas' operations by the new management,
total utilized resources remained practically unchanged in 1971. BR
funds, providing almost one-third of Caldas' total resources, were its
most important source of funds, followed by its own equity, which contri-
buted about one-fifth of the total, and the loan from the Federacion with
about one-sixth. In mid-1972, the Federacion's loan, originally payable
in five years, was rescheduled over ten years, including two years of
grace, free of interest charges. For the remaining term of tne loan in-
terest charges were reduced from 13.5% to 9% annually.
15.       Financial Structure.  Summarized financial statements covering
1967-71 are shown in Annex 6. Since Caldas' auditors have observed that
provisions should have been made for estimated losses on realization of
loans amounting to Col$18.1 million and equity investments of Col$13.3
ndllion, they have been incorporated in the presentation of Caldas' 1971



APPENDIX D
P age 5
financial structure. 1/ Total year-end 1971 assets stood at Col$421.9
million, practically equal to 1970. As a result of large disbursements in
1972, Caldas' total assets increased sharply to Col$546.1 million at year-
end. The debt/equity ratio (allowing for necessary provisions) was 3.9:1,
a decline from the 4.3:1 at the end of 1970 as a result of the Col$19.8
million capital increase in 1971. However, if a portion of the Federacion's
loan equivalent to the estimated provision for loans is included as "quasi-
equity" as proposed (see para. 25), the debt/equity ratio would be 2.7 at
the end of 1971 and 3.6:1 a year later. At year-end 1972, Caldas' current
ratio amounted to 1.1:1. While current assets of Caldas include substantial
past-due receivables and receivables from borrowers in serious difficulties,
indicating a weaker liquidity position than apparent from the current ratio,
the fact that the Federacion rescheduled its Col$72 million loan (including
capitalization of interests) and stopped interest charges on it, makes
Caldas' liquidity position acceptable. The proceeds of recent successful
joint financial bond issues by the five financieras have also improved Caldas'
liquidity.
16.        Income, Expenses and Profitability.  According to its auditors
Caldas' Col$3.3 million profit for 1971 was over-stated by Col$3.1 mil-
lion, which represents bad debts written off during the year against re-
serves but not charged to the profit and loss statement. Unaudited 1972
statements show a Col$5.1 million profit, which may, however, be subject
to similar qualifications. Caldas' financial performance reflects the poor
quality of its portfolio. At the end of 1971, Caldas had stopped charging
interest on loans equivalent to 12.6% of its loan portfolio and had, during
the year, rescheduled loans equivalent to 10.3% of its portfolio. These
percentages improved to 10.4% and 7.8% respectively, a year later. Loans
equivalent to 2.5% of its portfolio were converted into equity in 1971 and
1.6% in 1972. Administrative expenses as a proportion of average total assets
continued to decrease, from a high of 3.5% in 1968 to 3.1% in 1970 and
to 2.2% in 1971, and to an estimated 2.1% in 1972.
17.       Quality of Loan and Investment Portfolios.  The poor quality
of the portfolio is Caldas' main problem. At the end of 1971, as much
as 46.1% of the value of Caldas' equity and loan portfolio was invested
in companies with problematical prospects. A year later, this percentage
had decreased to 41.6%.
1/   In addition, necessary provisions of Col$11.1 million for the equity
portfolio and Col$6.1 million for the loan portfolio, estimated on
the basis of the October 31, 1971 audit report have been incorporated
in the Annexes. There was no year-end audit for 1970.

/1   Companies with poor prospects are defined as cases in which the chances
that Caldas will lose its investment are greater than those of recover-
ing it. Companies with uncertain prospects are defined as cases in
which chances of recovers are about equal to the chances cf loss.
18.       It is difficult to estimate the size and timing of the losses
Caldas may have on its portfolio. On the basis of the Col$206.6 million
of total exposure in compenies in difficulties at year-end 1971, Caldas may
have losses in the range of Col$80-115 million, to be written off in 1972-
1976.
19.       Reserves and Dividend Policy.  Caldas, like the other finan-
cieras, has no specific provisions for portfolio losses. As Caldas'
reserves and unappropriated surplus amounted only to Col$10.1 million, at
the end of 1971 and to Col$9.2 million a year later, the likely substantial
write-offs would have to be made against profits or capital. Moreover, if
Caldas is to maintain a sound financial structure, it should have the capacity,
while writing off its losses, (a) to maintain a prudent debt/e-cuity ratio
and (b) to ensure its equity does not decline below the size of i ts equity
portfolio. To determine the resources Caldas might need to reconstitute its
equity to these levels, it is necessary to take into account (a) the range
of possible losses (Col$80-115 million over 1972-76), (b) the projection of
pre-tax earnings (Col$78 million for 1972-76, see para. 24) and (c) the
timing of the losses. With regard to the last point, it is necessary to
consider that write-offs may come at a faster rate than earnings are
generated. Based on the above considerations, Caldas needs the capacity
to write off as much as Col$50-70 million in any one year. This capacity
has t'ben provided by the Federacion by making its loan of Col$72 million
convertible to equity as needed to reconstitute Caldas' equity to the levels
specified above.



APPENDIX D
Page 7
20.       Caldas last paid a dividend of 8% in 1969.  The financiera does
not expect to pay a dividend over the next five years, given the need to
retain earnings in the face of likely substantial write-offs.
21.       Audit of Accounts.  Caldas is audited annually by Price Water-
house and Company. The auditors have not expressed an opinion on the
financial statements for 1971 because Caldas has substantial and serious
under-provisions for losses on equity investments and bad debts, as
noted above.
PROSPECTS
22.       Business Forecast.  Caldas' projections (Appendix 7) 1/ assume
1972 local currency loan approvals of Col$150 million, remaining at the
high 1971 level, which resulted from Caldas' participation in several
joint Bank-financed projects together with the financieras and from
financing projects channeled to it to use its pre-allocation. On the
other hand, Caldas was slower to use the funds for its own projects.
For 1973, with less participation in joint projects likely, Caldas
expects approvals to decline to Col$115 million. Thereafter, approvals
are projected to increase by about 20% annually, which implies a real
growth rate of about 10% a year, and should correspond to industrial
growth in the Caldas region. With suitable staff for appraisal, the
rate of growth projected appears attainable. While 1972 loan approvals
were in line with projections, disbursements and, thereby, total assets in-
creased faster than expected. In the light of recent developillents, Caldas'
growth may exceed projections, overall.
23.       Sources of Funds.  Funds of about US$7 million, available at year-
end 1971, were mainly those from its pre-allocation under Bank loans. Caldas
expects to finance most of its borrower's needs for equipment imports from
Bank funds and consequently, these funds would sharply increase their import-
ance as Caldas' single largest source of funds. Great efforts, however, will
be needed to raise more than the currently projected local savings, mainly
through joint financiera bond issues. Projected use of BR funds reflects
Caldas' past access to this source. Short-term foreign exchange credit lines
available or in prospect are sufficient to carry out the forecast short-term
foreign exchange operations.
24.       Financial Projections.  If Caldas' business and resources develop
as forecast, profits before taxes and write-offs of Col$76.8 million are
projected for 1972-76. The projections are based on writing off Col$30 mil-
lion of the portfolio in 1972 and 1973. If actual write-offs are in the
Col$80-115 million range a considerable part of the projected profits may,
in fact, not materialize. On the other hand, the reduction of interest on
the Federacion's loan tends to offset this possibility. Administrative ex-
penses are projected to stay close to the 1971 figure of 2.2% of total assets.
1/   Caldas' projections are based on its 1971 statements without portfolio
loss provisions.

Compared to 2.1% for ilorte, which is a smaller company, and 1.0-1.7% for the
larger three financieras, Caldas' administrative expenses are reasonable.
Thiey might have to be somewhat higher than Caldas expects, given its need to
expand and improve the quality of its staff. Caldas appropriately does not
project any dividend through 1976, and plans to use profits to write off
expected losses and, if possible, to build up reserves.
25.       Total assets are expected to grow at an annual average of less than
10% throughout 1976, which may turn out to be a conservative -sumption.  With
this relatively slow assets growth, Caldas would not exceed i s 4:1 debt/equity
limitation until 1976, if the debt/equity ratio is calculated by reducing
equity for necessary portfo'lio loss provisions but including the Federacion's
loan as "quasi-equity" up to the estimated level of provisions. However, as
the other financieras, Caldas would annually estimate a reasonable level of
provisions needed.
26.       Caldas' current ratio is projected to remain about 1.1:1 throughout
1976. Thus, liquidity is expected to remain tight, particularly if Caldas has
to write-off a larger part of its portfolio than it projects, implying lower
loan and interest collections than forecast. Caldas should continue to watch
its liquidity closely and prepare annually the monthly cash flow projection
and comparisons of actual performance to the projection, as required under
its policy guidelines.
27.       Caldas' tight financial situation is also reflected in the debt-
service coverage implied by the projections. The expected higher level of
joint financiera bond issues and the rescheduling of the Federacion's loan,
however, should result in better liquidity for Caldas. After 1976, as the
worst part of Caldas' portfolio would have been liquidated, debt-service
coverage should increase.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMl4ENDATIONS
23.       While Caldas has made progress in solving its problems, its recovery
is proving slower and more difficult than expected. Caldas' new management
has performed well in a difficult situation, having restored c.-ifidence in
the financiera on the part of its shareholders, creditors and local
businessmen. The recent hiring of a technical vice-president amd additional
staff is a step in the direction of strengthening staff, improving Caldas'
capt;a-',;to perform adequate project appraisals, follow-up on its investments
and improve its financial planning. The rescheduling of the loan from the
Federacion and recent joint bond issues have made Caldas' liqudity position
acceptable. It will, however, continue to be tight and will need to be
watched closely for some time to come. Quality of portfolio has shown a modest
improvement. In order to solve the problemn of expected write-offs and of
Caldas' financial structure the Federacion agreed with Caldas to convert its
Col$72 million loan into equity upon specific occurrences.

29.       Despite the progress made under the new management, serious pro-
blems remain. In tackling the major one, the poor quality of Caldas'
portfolio, management may have been keeping some companies operating rather
than considering liquidation of companies that may ultimately not be rescued.
It will need to give particular attention to this problem.
30.       If management carries out further institutional improvements and
can clean up the portfolio and thereby further consolidate Caldas' financial
position, the financiera should be able to increase its developmental role
by helping the economic diversification of the Caldas region.
31.       Given the commitment of the Federacion to assist Caldas, the
financiera's projected satisfactory debt-service capacity and the improve-
ment in its portfolio under the new management, a modest increase in Caldas'
debt/equity limit from 4:1 to 4.5:1 is appropriate. The Federacion's loan
would be included as "quasi-equity", up to the level of estimated necessary
provisions.

CORPORATION FINANCIERA DEL NORTE
INTRODUCTION
1.        Norte was founded in 1963 and started operations in Barranquilla in
1964. It was promoted by local interests mainly in order to foster the in-
dustrial development of Colombia's northern coastal areas. IFC became a share-
holder in 1969.
ORGANIZATION
2.        Share Capital and Ownership.  Norte's share capital increased 15.9%
to Col$56.4 million during 1972. Norte's ownership by 551 shareholders (Annex
1) continues to be the most widely spread among the financieras. As of end
1971, Colombian private shareholders owned 41.9% of the total, foreign and
foreign-controlled shareholders, 30.2% and governmental shareholders, 12.5%;
IFC had remained Norte's largest single shareholder with 15.4% of the total.
In order to assist Norte in its capital mobilization plan (para. 21), IFC
opted to take 50% of its 1971 dividend in stock (IFC/R72-41 and resolution
No. IFC 72-26).
3.        Board of Directors and Management.  Norte's Board of Directors
(Annex 2) was elected on February 29, 1972 for two years. The large number
of shareholders is reflected in the composition of the Board, which consists
of 10 principals and their alternates. The Board, which meets weekly, is
a working body. Turnover has been very small. IFC's Director resigned in
1971. Since then, Dr. Luis Machado, IFC's consultant, has been advisor to
Norte's Board.
4.        Mr. Alvaro Jaramillo has been Norte's president since inception.
He is experienced and dynamic and has greatly contributed toward the success-
ful growth of the financiera. Norte's technical vice-president, responsible
for loans and investments, died in 1972. The post has only recently been
filled with a staff member who has spent several years with the financiera.
5.        Staff and Internal Organization.  Norte's organization (Annex 3),
except for appraisal and follow-up, has kept pace with the financiera's growth.
For Norte to cope with its projected increased activities, operational staff
will have to be strengthened. There had been a higher turnover in financial
analysts than in the past and the financiera's engineer responsible for tech-
nical project evaluations was hired only early last year after his predeces-
sor's resignation. However, since then Norte has hired a second engineer and
two more economists. Furthermore, Norte agreed to employ two more economists
or engineers to strengthen its appraisal and supervision capacity for the
proposed loan.
6.        Appraisal and Follow-up.  The quality of Norte's appraisal work
still varies too widely, partly due to lack of clear guidelines for project



APPENDIX E
Page 2
evaluation and the long absence of control from the technical vice-presidency.
Focus on engineering and marketing aspects is often inadequate. Economic
analysis also will have to be strengthened further.  Norte often receives
insufficiently prepared financing proposals from its clients and must there-
fore play a substantial role in project appraisal as well as in project pre-
paration.  While this constitutes valuable technical assistance on Norte's
part, it also is a considerable strain on its staff, and Norte would do better
to limit this service to its smaller clients. Although the intensity of
Norte's follow-up visits has somewhat declined, its follow-up work is adequate.
Norte's management has been taking steps to improve the financiera's appraisal
and follow-up work.
7.        Procurement and Disbursement Procedures.  Norte, like the other
financieras, largely relies on its customers for proper equipment selection.
It urges them, however, to procure equipment from the most competitive sources
available to them and at least for large projects, Norte normally requires
that its clients present quotations from several firms of international repu-
tation. This aspect of Norte's operations, as well as its disbursement system,
is satisfactory.
OPERATIONS
8.        Lending Operations.  Peso loans, including loans for import financ-
ing with Bank funds, constitute by far the largest share of Norte's operations.
Loan approvals (Annex 4) increased by 19%, from Col$189.5 million in 1970 to
Col$225.2 million in 1971, largely due to availability of funds under the last
Banlc loan. Practically all lending (99%) has gone to industry, with paper and
printing, and chemicals receiving the largest share; the portfolio is well
diversified among industrial sectors. Loans approved in 1971 were larger than
those of the previous year (70% as against 48% of the total exceeded Col$5
million), thereby reflecting the increasing portion of generally larger than
average Bank-financed projects. Average terms and the proportion of fixed
asset financing also increased substantially, for the same reason. Loans for
working capital purposes were 27% of the total in 1970, and 18% in 1971, loans
with maturities of more than five years increased from 61% to 80% during the
period.  Loans granted to firms in Atlantico and Bolivar, Norte's natural
market, were 58%, up from 51% in 1970. The substantial portion of loans
made outside the Atlantic coast region can be largely attributed to large
Bank-financed projects in which Norte participated together with other
financieras. Norte has continued to assist its clients through export-import
and working capital financing in foreign exchange. This portion of Norte's
loan portfolio increased from US$1.6 million at the end of 1970, to US$2.3
million a year later.
9.        Equity Investments and Promotions.  Norte's equity portfolio (Annex
5) increased 22.9% in 1971. In absolute terms, however, the increase from
Col$20.1 million to Col$24.7 million (and to Col$33.1 million in 1972) was
rather snall and equity investments at the end of 1971 still took up only
34.5% of N.orte's own equity. Additional investments in two profitable companies,
Compania Pesquera Vil-ingos de Colombia (Vil-ingos), a shrimp fishing and pro-
cessing corpany, and Industrias Pecuarias y Agricolas (Ingral) involved in



APPENDIX E
Page 3
cattle raising and slaughterhouse activities, accounted for about two thirds
of the increase; the remainder were two investments in tourism projects in
Cartagena (a new hotel mainly for international tourism and a tourism pro-
motion company). All these companies were promoted by Norte. The financiera's
policy statement limits its holdings to normally 25% of the companies in which
is invests. Equity investments exceeding this limit involve two companies in
which it has not yet been feasible to reduce Norte's large original partici-
pation as promoter.  Norte has maintained a cautious attitude towards promo-
tions, although the bulk of the companies it promoted are profitable and have
good prospects.  Morte is considering several new projects which would call
for equity investments.
10.       Other Operations.  Norte has not yet carried out any underwriting
or other related operations in the capital market. Guarantees have little
importance and are only granted to well-known clients. Guarantees outstanding
dropped sharply from Col$6.8 million in 1970 to Col$2.5 million and Col$0.5
million, respectively, in 1971 and 1972.
FINANCIAL POSITON AND RFSULTS
11.       Borrowings and Resource Position.  Norte's total assets increased
rapidly from Col$269.2 million to Col$354.2 million, by 31.6%, in 1971, and even
more rapidly to Col$485.1 million, in 1972. The following shows the changes
in the composition of its resources to finance the increase in 1971 (in
Col$ million):

IBRD funds have further increased in importance as Norte's most important single
source of finance, accounting for more than one-third of total resources. Norte
succeeded in using about one-eighth of the four Bank loans. Increase in Bank
funds accounted for two-thirds of the net increase in resources in 1971. Re-
sources provided from and through BR (except Bank funds) have only marginally
increased and have remained about equal to Norte's equity. Growth of both BR
funds and own equity, however, did not keep pace with the growth of total re-
sources. Morte continued to make efforts to place its bonds with institutional



APPENDIX E
Page 4
investors. Although bonds outstanding almost doubled in 1971, they still only
provided 3.4% of total resources at the end of that year. Norte, like the
other financieras, continues to be faced with a tight local currency situa-
tion. In 1972, however, the five financieras began a successful drive to
issue bonds jointly, and are making great efforts thereby to raise additional
local resources.
12.       Financial Structure.  Summarized financial statements covering
fiscal years 1967-1971 may be found in Annex 6. Norte's financial structure
is sound. However, due to its rapid growth its total debt/equity ratio in-
creased sharply from 3.3:1 to 4.0:1 in 1971, and 4.8:1 in 1972 (without allow-
ing for provisions), pointing to the need to increase Norte's-equity basis
in order to maintain a prudent relation to its debt. Norte's present con-
tractual debt/equity limit is 5.0:1. If allowance is made for prudent pro-
visions (see para. 16) Norte's year-end 1971 debt/equity ratio reaches 4.2:1.
Liquidity has remained satisfactory.
13.       Income, Expenses and Profitability.  Income is almost fully derived
from lending operations, with dividend income accounting for only 2.8% of total
income. Norte's profitability has been increasing steadily. Net profit in
1971 was Col$12.5 million, equivalent to a 16.1% return on average equity, up
from Col$10.0 million (14.7%) in 1971 and Col$8.2 million (13.4%) in 1970.
Norte's administrative costs of 2.1% of total assets are the highest among
the financieras, reflecting that it has the smallest total assets. However,
administrative costs declined from 2.2% to 2.1% of total assets in 1972 and,
as business expands they should decline further.
14.       Quality of Loan and Investment Portfolio.  Norte's loan portfolio
is basically sound. At the end of 1971, loans in arrears (including interest)
for more than three months totaled Col$13.0 million; the total principal out-
standing with clients in arrears was Col$21.7 million, or 7.4% of loan port-
folio. Almost two-thirds of these arrears are with companies operating pro-
fitably. With a small exception, all loans in arrears to 10 companies in
serious difficulties or in liquidation are adequately secured, and mangement
considers that no losses will be incurred in collecting receivable balances
at December 31, 1971. Ref;.nancing in 1971, all based on thorough analysis
of each refinancing proposal, involved six companies owing a total principal
of Col$18.3 million at the end of 1971. More than half of this amount was
outstanding to Caribe Inn Ltda., a luxury hotel for internatioval tourism,
the completion of which has been delayed pending the completion of the road
connecting Venezuela with Colombia's north coast. This delay is causing
substantial cost overruns. Although Norte is sufficiently secured, it is aware
that this company must be closely watched.
15.       Norte's equity portfolio (Annex 5) is quite sound overall; three-
quarters of it is invested in companies operating at a profit. Only one
company, of which Norte holds Col$0.4 million in equity, is in liquidation.
Norte expects a full write-off. Norte's largest equity investments are in



APPENDIX E
Page 5
Ingral and Vikingos (see para. 9). Both companies also received substantial
loans from Norte. Ingral is very profitable; Vikingos, which has been pro-
fitable in 1971 and 1972 apparently has passed the start-up phase of its
operations. Mr. Jaramillo dedicates ample time to both companies. Norte
also has a substantial loan and equity exposure in Consorcio Pesquero
Colombiano (see Appendix C, para. 15).
16.       Reserves and Dividend Policy.  Norte, like the other financieras, has
no specific provisions for portfolio losses. Reserves for losses on receivables
of Col$5.7 million and on equity investments of Col$1.1 million seem adequate,
given the overall good quality of Norte's portfolio. An estimated Col$1.1 mil-
lion of these reserves is only needed to provide for realistically estimated
loss possibilities; management expects no losses in the collection of re-
ceivables. At year-end 1971, the financiera's total reserves and unappropriat-
ed surplus (including a legal reserve of Col$3.4 million which may be used to
absorb annual net losses and deducting the dividend declared from 1971 earnings)
amounted to Col$16.4 million, providing a 5.1% coverage of total portfolio.
17.       Norte has continued its efforts to establish a satisfactory dividend
record to widen acceptance of its shares in the market; so far, they are not
yet registered on any stock exchange. Out of 1972 earnings, Norte declared
a 14.4% dividend, representing a 65.0% pay-out, with the option to its stock-
holders -- as in the previous year -- to accept the dividend in common shares
at par. This compares with a 13.2% dividend, at a 64.0% pay-out, for 1971. To
assist Norte in its capital mobilization efforts IFC opted to receive 50% of
its dividend for 1971 in stock. Compared to 1971, book value of shares in-
creased in 1972 from 146.9% to 148.8% of par and net income per share from
Col$2.06 to Col$2.22.
18.       Foreign Exchange Risk.  All operations reviewed by the mission indicate
that the financiera has followed its policy of not incurring the foreign exchange
risk in its operations.
19.       Audit of Accounts.  Forte is audited annually by Price Waterhouse
& Co. No qualification appears in the 1971 audit report.
PROSPECTS
20.       Business Forecasts.  Norte based its operational forecasts for
1972-1976 (for projections see Annex 7) on its expectation of a continuing
and increasing strong demand for local and foreign currency, mainly by in-
dustry.  Local currency loan approvals (including Bank ftnds in pesos) there-
fore are projected to rise to Col$349.O million in 1974, which compares to
Col$225.2 million in 1971. Projected commitments of Bank funds are partly
based on a pipeline of projects which are either under study by Norte or for
which investment proposals have been received. Projected growth of foreign
currency loans, largely import financing in connection with fixed asset loans,
even exceeds the projected growtlh of local currency lending.  New equity in-
vestments are expected to average only a modest Col$6.0 million a year, as



APPENDIX E
Page 6
against Col$11.5 million in 1971.  In view of Norte's past rapid growth and
the expected strong demand for industrial financing, these five-year projec-
tions appear somewhat optimistic but attainable, provided that Norte can
obtain sufficient resources for financing its clients' long-term foreign
exchange needs (mainly expected from the Bank) and of its clients' local
currency needs and that it can raise additional equity to increase its lend-
ing basis sufficiently. Growth of total assets in 1972 exceeded projections,
whereas net profit lagged slightly behind expectations.
21.       Sources of Funds.  As of end 1971, funds available were mainly
Col$16 million in oxn resources and unutilized short-term credit lines from
foreign commercial banks. Norte expects to finance most of its clients' needs
for equipment imports from new Bank funds, which would sharply increase in
their importance as Norte's single largest source of finance. Great efforts,
however, will be needed to raise more than the projected local savings to
match these Bank funds, mainly through joint financiera bond issues, and even
more so, to raise the projected average of about Col$10 million a year in share
capital.  Morte is making strong efforts to obtain new capital from existing
and new shareholders. Projected utilization of BR funds reflects Norte's
access to this source in the past. Short-term foreign exchange resources
available or in prospect are sufficient to carry out the forecast foreign
exchange operations.
22.       Financial Projections.  Norte's assets grew 37.2% in 1972 and are
forecast to growq about 40% each in 1973 and 1974. Given its rapid asset
growth in the past and the continuing strong demand for industrial financing,
these projections appear reasonable. By 1974, total assets would more than
double. Due to this rapid growth of assets, in spite of projected considerable
capital increases, Norte would exceed its present debt/equity limitation in
1974, and even earlier if its capital mobilization plan falls short of ex-
pectations. In order to provide the needed additional leverages for its
operations, a relaxation of Norte's debt/equity ratio is appropriate from
its present 5:1, to which it is bound by its Policy Statement and agreements
under Bankl loans, to 6:1.  The strength of Norte's portfolio and reserves
and its experience and record of operations justify the relaxation.
23.       Reserves and surplus (including total annual net incomes) are expected
to remain througb 1976 at about 7% of total portfolio, which should be adequate
if Norte continues its present prudent investrment policy. Ratios of liquidity,
a_tbougb somewhat dereasing, and debt/service coverage should be comfortable
throughout the forecast period.
24.       Assumiing that expected volume of business and financial margins are
acUlieved, Yorte's net income would more than treble from Col$fn.0 million in
1971 to Col$35.1 million in 1976, equivalent to an increase from 14.7% to 19.8%
on average equitv. Increasing profitability is also reflected in dividends
projected to rise from 13.2% in 1971 to 18.0% in 1976, at prudent pay-out levels.
Consequently, despite the projected substantial capital additions, book value



APPENDIX E
Page 7
of shares would increase from 146.8% to 192.1% of par during the five-year
period. The projected higher income is largely a result of projected higher
financial leverage and lower administrative costs, expected to fall from 2.2%
of average total assets in 1971 to 1.0% in 1976. Decreases below a level of
1.4%, however, may be difficult to achieve.
CONCLUSIONS MTD RECO1M'¶.NDATIONS
25.       Norte has been carrying out a useful and growing role in promoting
and financin,  primarily industrial projects on the Colombian North Coast,
and has become an important institution contributing to regional development.
The financiera continues to have capable management.  While its organization,
particularly its appraisal and follow-up capacity, had not fully kept pace
with the financiera's rapid growth, it has taken steps to improve these
aspects of its operations, and it agreed to take further measures designed
to enable it to handle its increased workload under the proposed loan.
26.       Norte has been performing well.  It has grown rapidly and retained
its overall good quality of portfolio and adequate reserves to cover possible
losses. It has made good use of Bank funds and is expected to continue doing
so. Projected debt/service capacity is comfortable. The financiera is credit-
worthy and is a suitable recipient for receiving Bank funds.
27.       In view of the strength of Nlorte's portfolio, adequacy of reserves,
its experience and record of operations, it is recommended that the 5:1 limit
set in the Subsidiary Loan Agreement related to the Bank loans be relaxed to
6:1, and that Norte's Policy Statement be modified accordingly. Realistically
estimated provisions would be included in this computation.

CORPORACION FINANCIERA DE OCCIDENTE
INTRODUCTION
1.        Occidente was established in Pereira in 1966 by a group of local
businessmen, mainly to finance private manufacturing enterprises. Pereira
is the capital of Risaralda, one of Colombia's most important coffee growing
areas. Industry is still relatively unimportant in this region.
ORGANIZATION
2.        Share Capital and Ownership.  At the end of 1971, Occidente's share
capital of Col$ 31.8 million was held by 233 shareholders (Annex 1); it
remained virtually unchanged in 1972. Private Colombian nationals owned one-
half of the total. The First National City Bank group, which became a share-
holder in 1969, was the largest single shareholder group (37.7% of total),
followed by national and local coffee interests (23.7%). Occidente's shares
are not registered on any stock exchange.
3.        Board, Management and Staff.  Powers to conduct Occidente's affairs
are vested in its Board of seven directors (Annex 2), consisting in the
majority of experienced bankers and industrialists. Three members represent
the First National City Bank group, two, coffee interests and the remaining
two represent smaller shareholders. Five votes are needed for board decisions.
The board has delegated to the President authority to approve loans of up
to Col$ 50,000 and to a loan committee, composed of three board members and
the President, to approve loans up to a Col$ 2 million to one borrower, as
long as the committee votes unanimously. The board, which is elected for a
one-year period, usually meets monthly while the loan committee meets twice
a month.
4.        Mr. Gaviria, Occidente's President since inception, is capable
and dynamic. He was a director of the National Planning Department and
Technical Deputy Manager of the National Association of Industrialists.
Mr. Gaviria follows closely and is well informed about all aspects of
the financiera's operations, as is suitable in a small company. He works
closely with Mr. Vallejo, Vice-President since 1969, who gives the President
good support. Annex 3 shows Occidente's organization chart.
5.        Occidente's financial analysts responsible for equity investments,
lending for new projects and for the loan portfolio, are well qualified, but
they still lack experience. However, this is made up for by close super-
vision of management. In addition, Occidente recently hired an industrial
engineer. Staffing is sufficient for the present level of operations. The
financiera plans to hire a second engineer as well as a financial analyst
in the near future.



APPENDIX F
Page 2
6.        Appraisal and Follow-up.  Although Occidente has lent mostly for
short-term working capital, its staff has experience in preparing appraisals
for fixed asset financing with PIF funds and for a few projects it intended
to finance with Bank funds through two of the five financieras. Overall,
these appraisals are satisfactory, although they show weaknesses in financial
analysis, particularly in analyzing debt service capacity of applicants.
With continuing experience, Occidente's appraisals should improve substantially.
7.        Occidente follows up closely on its investments, except for those
located in the Bogota region, which are visited more infrequently.  Occidente
intends to close this gap with the hiring of the abovementioned financial
analyst. Follow-up reports are generally complete and clearly describe the
situations of investments; however, they show the same weakness as the
appraisal reports. Occidente regularly informs its borrowers of results of
follow-up visits and makes specific recommendations whenever necessary.
8.        Procurement and Disbursement Procedures.  Given Occidente's present
level of operations, procedures are satisfactory overall. It generally checks
on capital costs and procurement aspects of projects and on adequacy of
construction cost.
OPERATIONS
9.        Lending Operations.  In 1971, the sixth year of operation, Occidente's
loan disbursements amounted to Col$ 102.9 million, sharply up from Col$ 71.0
million in 1970 and Col$ 42.2 million in 1969 (Annex 4). Due to the rapid
growth in disbursements, its loan portfolio rose more than 50% in 1970, from
Col$ 39.2 million to Col$ 61.0 million, followed by a 40% increase to Col$ 85.4
million in 1971.
10.       Over the last three years, Occidente has made predominantly small,
short-term loans to existing enterprises for financing working capital.
However, a clear trend in the opposite direction is visible. Between 1969-71,
the average loan size was Col$ 302,000, with 53% of loans disbursed under
Col$ 500,000, 68% were loans for up to two years; 29%, for two to five years;
and only 4%, for more than five years. As much as 82% of loan disbursements
were for working capital, and 97% for existing companies. The industrial
sector received 92% of the total disbursed, with the bulk (29%) for textile
industries. Although 55% of loans were made in Risaralda, as much as 30%
was for the Bogota region, which has shown a tendency to receive an increasing
share.
11.       Equity Investments.  Occidente's portfolio contains 13 equity
investments amounting to Col$ 16.5 million, equivalent to 14% of its total
loan and equity portfolio and to 47% of its own equity (Annex 5).  Five of
the companies have been promoted by Occidente. The major part of the portfolio,
Col$ 9.2 million, is in the shares of Comestibles La Rosa, Colombia's largest
food processer, a subsidiary of the Nestle Company.



APPENDIX F
Page 3
12.       Other Operations.  In addition to its regular lending operations,
Occidente finances letters of credit and exports, and provides guarantees.
At the end of 1971, Col$ 17.8 million in letters of credit and export financing
was outstanding, and Col$ 9.7 million in guarantees.
13.       Policies.  In April 1972, Occidente's board approved a Policy
Statement (Annex 8), resembling those of the five financieras, which it
intends to adhere to, and which contains all the provisions usual to develop-
ment finance companies associated with the Bank group. At present, it owns
more than the 25% of the voting shares of six companies to which it would
limit itself normally. Reductions of its exposure in these companies will
only be possible in the long run as these investments -- most of which have
been promoted by Occidente -- mature.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
14.       Resources.  Occidente has financed its operations largely from its
own capital. During the 1969-1971 period, 52% of disbursements had been
financed with its own equity. Its next most important source of funds is the
five year bonds it issues; at the end of 1971, Col$ 26.9 million were out-
standing out of a total of Col$ 43 million issued. The only long-term borrow-
ings available to Occidente are PIF funds, of which Col$ 8.2 million were
utilized at the end of 1971. In short-term funds, it had time deposits of
Col$ 11.1 million, and it had drawn US$ 842,000 of its US$ 1.2 million credit
lines from foreign commercial banks. For long-term investment, Occidente has
only PIF funds and its own equity available.
15.       Financial Structure.  Financial statements for the years 1967-1971
are shown in Annex 6. Total assets at the end of 1972 stood at Col$191.7
million, representing a 52% increase over 1971 (the increase had been 63%
to Col$126.2 million in 1971), reflecting Occidente's rapidly growing opera-
tions. Its financial structure at year-end 1971 was sound with a 2.9:1
total debt to equity ratio and a current ratio of 1.3:1. Indebtedness had
increased to 3.7 times debt by the end of 1972.
16.       Income, Expenses and Profitability.  Since it started operating in
1967, Occidente has developed a good profit record. In 1972, net profit after
taxes was Col$6.3 million, up 75% from Col$3.6 million in 1971. The table
below shows the development of income and expenditures for 1971, expressed
as percentages of average total assets:
1968      1969       1970       1971
Total income               13.1      13.2       13.1       14.3
Financial expenses          3.9       5.1        4.2        6.0
Gross spread                9.2       8.1        8.9        8.3
Administrative expenses   3.4         3.1        2.8        2.9
Profit before tax           5.8       5.0        6.1        5.4
Tax                         1.5       1.5        2.1        1.7
Net Profit            4.3        3.5        4.0        3.7



APPENDIX F
Page 4
Higher gross income in 1971 stemmed largely from an increase in guaranty and
letter of credit business, mainly through its connection with the First National
City Bank. The drop in financial expenses in 1970 reflects the large share
capital increase from Col$ 13.8 million to Col$ 29.0 million during that year,
while the increase in 1971 is a result of the increased indebtedness, as the
debt/equity ratio rose from 1.3:1 to 2.9:1. The result was a decline in the
spread in 1971, which led to a reduction in net profit as a percentage of
average total assets. Despite the decrease in net profit on average total
assets, as a result of increased financial leverage profit after taxes on
year-end share capital increased from 8.6% in 1970, to 12.2% in 1971. The
return on share capital is still somewhat low, reflecting relatively high
financial and, due to Occidente's small size, administrative costs. The
latter, amounting to 2.9% of average total assets in 1971, are likely to
decrease with the projected growth of the company. Administrative costs
dropped sharply to 2.4% of average total assets in 1972, due to the rapid
increase in operations.
17.       Quality of Loan and Investment Portfolio.  Occidente's portfolio
is of good quality, overall. At the end of 1971, Occidente's outstanding
loans in arrears -- all with companies whose prospects were poor or uncertain -
amounted to Col$ 4.7 million, equivalent to 5% of the loan portfolio. With
the exception of a Col$ 2.7 million loan to a radio producer, these loans are
well secured, as is most of Occidente's portfolio. Consequently, losses on the
loan portfolio are not expected to be large. Of loans to companies in financial
difficulty, only the above-mentioned loan was rescheduled.
18.       Only Col$ 1.6 million, or one tenth of Occidente's equity portfolio,
is in companies with uncertain prospects: Col$ 400,000 with the radio manu-
facturer, Col$ 1.0 million in three promotional companies, and Col$ 200,000
in a company in liquidation expected to be a write-off.
19.       Reserves and Dividend Policy. Like the other financieras, Occidente
has no provisions for portfolio losses. It has reserves for bad debts of
Col$ 189,000 and for losses on equity investment of Col$ 200,000. Its total
reserves and unappropriated surplus (including a legal reserve of Col$ 1.6
million, which can be used only if Occidente shows operating losses but
excluding dividends for 1971) amounted to Col$ 2.9 million (net of 1971
dividend), equivalent to 2.2% of total portfolio at the end of 1971. Even
considering the good quality of Occidente's portfolio, reserves need to be
strengthened.
20.       Occidente started paying dividends in stock, amounting to 7% and
10%, respectively, in 1968 and 1969. After the entry of the First National
City Bank group as shareholder, Occidente paid cash dividends of 7.7% in
1970, resulting in a 76% pay-out, and of 10% in 1971, equivalent to an 83%
pay-out. These pay-out ratios are high, given the need for Occidente to
build up its reserves particularly in the light of its rapidly expanding
operations. Occidente maintained the 10% dividend on its 1972 earnings,
resulting in a substantial reduction in pay-out to 61%. As a result of
the high dividend pay-out and increases in share capital, book value of



APPENDIX F
Page 5
shares was only 121% of par at the end of 1971, approximately the same as
three years earlier.
21.       Foreign Exchange Risk.  All operations reviewed by the joint mission
indicate that Occidente protects itself adequately in its operations against
foreign exchange risk.
22.       Audit of Accounts.  Since 1969, Occidente has been audited annually
by Price Waterhouse & Co., whose report for 1971 contains no qualifications.
PROSPECTS
23.       Occidente's Business Forecast.  Occidente projects (Annex 7) that
loan approvals will increase at an average of 12% a year from Col$ 165.4
million in 1971 to Col$ 290 million in 1976, and that new equity investments
of Col$ 2-3 million a year will be made. This moderate growth rate should
be easily attainable, given the rapid growth of the company in the last
few years and its good management, if matched by a similar growth of equity.
Results for 1972 virtually coincide with projections.
24.       Resource Needs.  Total commitments during the five year period are
expected to be over' one billion pesos, mostly to be financed with Occidente's
own funds, bond issues, PIF and foreign bank credit lines. Partly based on
a project pipeline, Occidente forecasts a need for commitments of Bank funds
equivalent to Col$ 117.5 million during 1973-76. The need for World Bank
resources to meet 1973 and 1974 commitments would be about US$ 1.8 million.
25.       Financial Projections.  If Occidente's business and resources
develop as forecast, annual growth of total assets would average 28% through-
out the forecast period, while net profit after taxes is projected to in-
crease from Col$ 3.6 million in 1971, to Col$ 16.5 million in 1976. This
growth would be slower than the actual growth over the last five years.
Assuming share capital increases of Col$ 2.7 million in 1972, Col$ 6.2 million
in 1973, Col$ 7 million in 1974, and Col$ 5 million in 1975, which Occidente
expects to raise mainly from existing shareholders, profit after taxes on
year-end share capital would increase from 12.2% to 33.1% in 1976, while
profit before taxes on average net worth would rise from 15.5% in 1971, to
34.2% in 1976. Administrative expenses as a percentage of average total
assets would decline from 2.9% in 1971, tto 1.8% in 1972 and reach a rather
low 1.0% at the end of 1976, about equal to present expenses of the largest
financieras.
26.       Dividends of 16% on par value are projected for 1972, increasing
to 27% in 1976, implying extremely high pay-out ratios, ranging from 81%
to 86%. With these sizeable dividends, reserves and surplus (excluding
projected dividends) would increase from Col$ 3.2 million in 1971 to
Col$ 4.3 million in 1972, and reach Col$ 11.0 million in 1976, while their
relationship to the total loan and equity investment portfolio would drop



APPENDIX F
Page 6
from 2.3% in 1971 to 2.2% in 1972 and reach only 2.5% by 1976. In view of
its rapidly expanding operations and growing portfolio of equity investments
and long-term loans, Occidente should have larger reserves. For this purpose,
its pay-out ratio should not exceed about 60% of earnings. Dividend pay-out
in 1972 amounted to 61% of earning showing Occidente's increasing awareness
for building up its reserves.
27.       Occidente's debt to equity ratio reached 3.7:1 at the end of 1972
and is projected to increase to 5.0:1 at the end of 1976, which indicates
that Occidente will either have to raise more capital or reduce its dividend
pay-out. If the pay-out ratio were limited to 50%, Occidente would not
exceed the 4:1 debt to equity considered reasonable for it, until 1974. BR
Intends to ensure that Occidente follows in future a prudent dividend and
reserve policy as stated in its Policy Statementp
28.       Occidente's debt service coverage, as implied by its projections,
would be satisfactory.  During the projected period, collections on loans
are expected to amount to a minimum of 1.2 times the amounts of repayments
on debts. Profits before financial expenses will be more than 1.7 times
interest payable.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
29.       Conclusions.  Although Occidente has engaged predominantly in
extending short-term working capital loans, it has also financed a number of
fixed asset investments and has a sizeable equity investment portfolio.
Past growth of operations has been impressive. Occidente's management is
dynamic and capable. Its staff has adequate capability for project appraisal,
follow-up and technical assistance to clients. Operating procedures are
generally satisfactory, although procurement practices leave room for improve-
ment. Occidente's financial situation is good. Its loan and equity portfolio
is of good quality. Loans generally have adequate security coverage. How-
ever, Occidente needs to continue making strong efforts to increase its re-
serves. With reasonable administrative costs it has achieved an acceptable
level of profitability. Prospects for future growth of operations are good.
30.       Recommendations.  It is recommended to accept BR's proposal that
Occidente participate in the proposed loan as it is a suitable recipient of
Bank funds.

CORPORACION FINANCIERA DEL CARIBE
INTRODUCTION
1.        Set up by a group of Dutch businessmen and the Banco de Colombia,
by which it was managed until the end of 1969, the Corporacion Financiera
del Caribe started operations in Bogota in 1968. The Bogota area, the cen-
ter of Caribe's operations, is the most highly industrialized of the coun-
try, accounting for 27.1% of total value added in 1967, and 30.2%"o of employ-
ment in manufacturing.
ORGANIZATION
2.        Share Capital and Ownership.  At the end of 1969, the Algemene
Bank rroup (Algemene Bank Nederland N.V., Hollandsche Bank Unie, N.V. and
Inter-American Trade and Development Corporation, N.V.) bought all of Caribe's
shares, with the intention of using it as the nucleus of a financial group
in Colombia; also to include a commercial bank, an insurance company and a
sales financing company. As the Algenene Bank group (Algemene) wanted to
maintain the majority, it sought shareholders willing to take ca minority
position. Subsequently, the Colombian Caracol group, which operates the
country's largest radio and television network, and three foreign enter-
prises entered as minority shareholders. Thus, at year-end 1971, foreign
interests held 75% of Caribe's Col$ 20 million paid-in share capital, with
Algemene owning 55%, and the Caracol group, 25% (Annex 1). Paid-in capital
increased slitghtly, to Col$ 20.5 million, in 1972.
3.        Board, Management and Staff.  Caribe's board (Annex 2) of six di-
rectors, three of which represent Algemene and three Caracol, comprises some
leading Colombian bankers and businessmen. Tne board, elected for a two-year
period, usually meets once a month with all members attending regularly.
Chairmanship is rotated annually between representatives of Algemene and
Caracol. The board has delegated authority to a management loan committee
to approve loans (a) up to Col$ 1.2 million without mortgages or liens and
up to Col$ 3 million with such security, if one board member participates
and (b) up to Col$ 1.8 million, and Col$ 4.5 million, respectively, if two
board members participate. Board members representing Algemene must obtain
prior approval from Amsterdam for loans exceeding these amounts and for all
equity investments.
4.        In 1970-71, Caribe was managed by a Colombian President and a Dutch
Vice-President, supplied by Algemene. Both left Caribe by the end of 1971.
Caribe's new organization (see Annex 3) provides for one President and two
Vice-Presidents. At present, however, only the Commercial Vice Presidency
is filled, by Mr. Valencia who joined the company in January 1972 and is
acting president. Mr. Valencia had been on the staff of IFI and Caldas
and was most recently Caldas' technical vice-president. Caribe's share-
holders apparently intend to nominate a distinguished Colombian of national
stature as President, who would mainly be responsible for major policy issues



APPENDIX G
Page 2
and government and public relations, but would not directly intervene in
Caribe's operations. His main task vould be to take a leading role in form-
ing the financial group envisaged by Algemene. A Dutch employee of Algemene
is to be nominated as administrative vice-president. At present, management
is inadequate considering, in particular, that Caribe has a relatively weak
staff.
5.        Caribe's small professional staff reflects the company's past
policy of relying on consultants for project appraisal and follow-up work.
The engineer, on whom Caribe was to mainly rely for project appraisal and
follow-up, apparently left the company in October after a seven-month stay,
to return to Caldas, from where he had been hired. The compan'v secretary,
who set up the Industrial Participation Certificate system (para. 15) and
reviewed some credit operations, left in May 1972. Other professionals in-
clude an accountant and two staff members with commercial banking experience,
in charge of the treasury and foreign exchange sections. In view of the
limited experience of Caribe's small staff, its performance will depend on
the quality of the supervision it receives from management.
6.        Appraisal and Follow-up.  Caribe has done almost entirely commer-
cial bank type lending, namely short-term working capital loans based mainly
on the board's knowledge of its borrowers, or on the security provided. Its
experience in long-term project appraisal is thus very limited. For its few
loans for fixed assets, Caribe used consultants to investigate technical as-
pects of projects. The market and financial aspects were mostly not appraised
specifically; instead, Caribe relied on the borrower's general reputation.
7.        Caribe's supervision of borrowers has been irregular; recent fi-
nancial information on them is scarce. Caribe's main concern has been its
borrowers' repayment records and the collateral business (letters of credit)
they offer, but it has hardly provided any technical assistance. In case
of projects in difficulties, consultants were used for follow-up, with the
same shortcomings as mentioned in the previous paragraph. Since Caribe's
staff has changed almost entirely, its past appraisal and supervision record
cannot be used to evaluate its present capacity in these fields.
8.        Procurement and Disbursement Procedures.  At present, Caribe ex-
ercises practically no control over its borrowers' procurement practices.
Moreover, disbursement procedures are also inadequate, with chacks limited
to the adequacy of the guarantees. The acting president is preparing an
operating manual outlining appraisal, follow-up, procurement and disbursement
procedures, which he intends to introduce.
OPERATIONS
9.        Lending Operations.  A breakdown of peso lending operations is
given in Annex 4. In 1971, its fourth year of operations, Caribe committed
loans totaling Col$ 31.7 million, compared to Col$ 14.2 million in 1970, and
Col$ 20.8 million in 1969. As Caribe financed mainly short-term working cap-
ital, time lags between commitments and disbursements were minimal, and both



APPENDIX G
Page 3
figures were equal for each year. The fast growth in commitments in 1971
reflects Caribe's more dynamic approach to business after the entry of the
new shareholders. As a result, total loans outstanding grew 63% in 1971,
from Col$ 27.7 million to Col$ 45.1 million.
10.       Caribe's lending has been characterized by a predominance of short-
term loans for financing working capital. Since inception, 75% of its loans
were for one to two years, 21%, two to five years, and only 4% (two loans
made in 1969) for more than five years; 38% of loans have been for working
capital, the remainder for fixed assets.
11.       Reflecting Caribe's generally cautious attitude, 97% of total
loans were committed for existing enterprises and only 3%/ for new ones.  A
breakdown by sectors shows that 54% of Caribe's loan commitments were for
manufacturing industries, and 10% for agriculture. A high proportion (35%)
has been committed for financing building construction. Caribe's lending
was concentrated in the Bogota area, which received 67%7 of loan commitments.
12.       Equity Investments.  Caribe has made only five equity investments
(Annex 5), totaling Col$ 1.4 million, the largest of which, amounting to Col$ 1.1
million, was promoted by the financiera. At the end of 1971, its equity port-
folio represented only 3% of its total loan and equity investments, and only
5.5Z of its own equity. Caribe is not presently considering any promotions.
13.       Other Operations.  Through 1971, Caribe did not extend guarantees.
It has, however, provided letter of credit and export financing.
14.       The most important of its non-lending activities, issuing Industrial
Participation Certificates (certificado de participacion) is a commercial paper
operation up to now only with the Colombian subsidiary of Phillips N.V., and
represents an innovation in the Colombian capital market. Phillips issues
six-month promissory notes to Caribe, on the basis of which Caribe issues a
Participation Certificate which states that the buyer is participating in paper
held in trust by Caribe. As each certificate is matched by a Phillips promis-
sory note, Caribe acts only as a trustee, and does not guarantee the paper.
Caribe's contract with Phillips provides for issuance of Col$ 50 million in
certificates. At the end of 1972, Col$ 11.7 million was outstanding, most
of it sold directly by Caribe and about one tenth through the stock exchange.
The bulk was taken by institutional investors.
15.       Policies.  Caribe's board has approved the Policy Statement shown
in Annex 8. It is similar to the Policy Statements of the five financieras.
IJith the exception of the 20:1 debt/equity limit (para. 30), it contains all
the provisions generally usual to development finance companies connected with
the Bank Group. "esults of past operations are in line with the recently adopted
policy except for Caribe's 381% holding of Astilleros del Pacifico shares, which
is over the 25% limit of its Policy Statement, which it would normally adhere
to. As the company is new and has uncertain prospects, Caribe may not be able
to reduce its holding to 25% for some time.



APPENDIX G

FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
16.       Resources.  Up to 1971, Caribe has been financing its operations
mainly from its own capital; this has accounted for 74% of commitments since
its inception. All of Caribe's term debt stems from BR funds,-mainly for
medium-term working capital financing. At the end of 1971, Caribe had
Col$ 17.6 million outstanding for working capital from BR (decree 2369/60
and IFF) and Col$ 3.7 million in PIF funds. It has not yet raised any funds
through bond issues. Of the US$ 1.0 million equivalent short-term foreign
exchange credit line available from Algemiene, only US$80,000 was utilized.
Other than its o,n equity and funds available from PIP, Caribe has no long-
term resources available.
17.       Financial Structure.  Unaudited income statements and balance
sheets for the years 1968-71 are shown in Annex 6. Total assets at the end
of 197? stood at Col$ 80.7 million, representing a 62% increase over 1971,
and reflecting Caribe's growing operations since the entry of the new share-
liolders.  The increase had been 52% in 1971.  Since Caribe had relied mainly
on its own resources, its total debt to equity ratio amounted to only 0.9:1
at the end of 1971. I-1owever, with a sharp increase in borrowing in 1972
this ratio rose to 1.7,' at year end.  At the same time, Caribe's current
ratio dropped From 3.3:1 to 2.2:1. Caribe's extremely low leverage and
strong liquidity position show its past highly conservative approach to
business.
18.       Income, Expenses and Profitability.  In 1972, Caribe's net profit
after taxes was Col$ 3.6 million, up 57% from Col$ 1.9 million in 1971, i.e.
sli,htly less than the 62% increase of its assets. The table below shows
the development of income and expenditures, expressed as percentages of
average total assets:
1969    1970    1971
Gross income                          14.0    15.6    17.2
Financial expenses                     3.7     3.5      3.4
Gross spread                          10.3    12.1    13.8
Administrative expenses                1.3      2.9     5.4
Profit before tax                      9.0     9.2      8.4
Tax                                    2.7     2.9      2.9
Net profit                             6.3     6.3      5.5
The percentage increase in gross income stems mainly from Caribe's signifi-
cant increase in financing letters of credit of its clients. Despite higher
gross income, net profit relative to average total assets declined in 1971,
due to the large increase in administrative expenses, from 2.9% of average
total assets in 1970 to 5.4% in 1971 an(1 in 1972. These very high admin-
istrative expenses reflect a costly management structure.



APPENDIX G
Page 5
19.       With the lower profit on average total assets, and almost unchanged
low financial leverage, profit before taxes on average net worth decreased
from 16.1% in 1970, to 15.9% in 1971, and profit after taxes on year-end
share capital from 12.7% to 11.5%.  These figures are still relatively high,
considering Caribe's low financial leverage and high administrative costs.
20.       Quality of Loan and Investment Portfolio.  Caribe's portfolio is
of good quality and generally well diversified without undue risk concentra-
tion in individual companies. At the end of 1971, no loans were in arrears
for over three months. In 1971, loans to three companies undergoing some
difficulties were rescheduled. Their total principal outstanding was
Col$ 5.3 million, or 12%' of Caribe's year-end portfolio. These companies
were the only ones in Caribe's portfolio with uncretain prospects. Except
for one of these companies, where Col$ 900,000 was not covered by guarantees,
the loan portfolio is well secured and no losses are expected at present.
21.       Caribe's small equity portfolio (Annex 5) of Col$ 1.4 million at
the end of 1971, included investments of Col$ 200,000 in two companies in
liquidation, on which Caribe expects to lose Col$ 150,000. Caribe's largest
equity investment of Col$ 1.1 million, is in a shipyard promoted by the fi-
nanciera. It began operations in 1972. Its prospects are still uncertain,
and the company apparently has management difficulties. However, through
its director on the board, Caribe is following the company's situation
closely.
22.       Reserves and Dividend Policy.  Caribe has no specific reserve for
bad debts, nor provisions for portfolio losses. Its reserves (including
legal reserves of Col$ 2.5 million only to be used if Caribe shows operating
losses), and unappropriated surplus, were Col$ 5.6 million at the end of 1971,
equivalent to 12.5% of Caribe's total portfolio. This is more than adequate
given the generally good quality of its portfolio and the sufficient security
for its loans. In future, Caribe would be well advised to make specific
allocations to portfolio reserves.
23.       In 1968 and 1969, Caribe paid a 4% dividend with pay-outs amounting
to 70% and 41% respectively. Since then, after Algemene gained control, no
dividends have been paid.  A 5% divicdend was derlared from 1972 earnings.
With the complete reinvestment of earnings up to 1971, book value increased
rapidly to 128"o of par in 1971, in spite of a Col$ 5.0 million capital in-
crease during that year.
24.       Foreign Exchange Risk Average.  All operations reviewed by the joint
mission indicate that in its operations, Caribe is not exposed to any foreign
exchange risk.
25.       Audit of Accounts.  In the past, Caribe's accounts were not audited
independently. Following the provision of its new Policy Statement, Caribe
is to be audited annually. It intends to use the auditors who audit Algemene,
Klynveldt and Kraayenhof, a Dutch firm with extensive international operations.

PROSPECTS
26.       Caribe's Business Forecasts.  Caribe projects (Annex 7) loan ap-
provals to increase from its Col$ 31.7 million level in 1971 by 50% in 1972,
40% in 1973, 35% in 1974 and 25% each in 1975-76.  With suitable management
and staff, these growth rates appear attainable, particularly in view of ac-
tual growth in 1971 and Caribe's now more dynamic orientation.  Terms of loan
approvals would change significantly: loans approved for one year would drop
from 66%"o of the total in 1972, to only 40% in 1976. Caribe's projections
foresee no equity investments, indicating that it intends to keep its cautious
attitude in this respect.  Growth of assets and profits in 1972 was substan-
tially higher than projected.
27.       Resource Needs.  Caribe's projections imply a yearly increase of
25-38% in funds from IFF and PIF, and assume bond placements of Col$ 6.0
rmillion in 1973, Col$ 9.0 million in 1974, Col$ 11.2 million in 1975, and
Col$ 19.5 million in 1976. Caribe gives its need for World Bank resources
at ColS 111.7 million during the forecast period of wqhich it expects to com-
mit about US$1.5 million equivalent in 1973-74, mainly for a sharp increase
in its business for small and medium-sized enterprises.
28.       Financial Projections.  If Caribe's business and resource forecasts
materialize, total assets wrould grow 30.4% annually, and net profit after tax,
from Col$ 2.3 million in 1971, to Col$ 3.1 million in 1972, and to Col$ 5.0
million in 1976. Assuming share capital increases by existing shareholders
at Col$ 5 million each in 1974 and 1975, profits after taxes on average paid-
in share capital would rise from 13.1% in 1971, to 15.5%' in 1972, and reach
16.7% in 1976, and profit before taxes on average equity would rise from 15.9%
in 1971, to 18.8% in 1972, but decline to 16.2%o in 1976, as a result of the
large retention of earnings and share capital increases. Throughout the
period, profitability due to low leverage and relatively high administra-
tive expenses remains modest. Administrative expenses are expected to decline
from 5.4% on average total assets in 1971 to 3.8%oZ in 1972 and, with the ex-
panding operations, reach a still rather high 2.9% in 1976 reflecting the
somewhat top-heavy management structure that Caribe expects to have. Over-
a1l, these projections seem attainable.
29.       Caribe intends to retain most of its future earnings.  It declared
a 57 from 1972 earnings, equivalent to a 30% pay-out. Dividends projected
for 1974, 1975 and 1976, are equivalent to a very low 1.2%, 2.0%, and 2.7%
of par value, respectively. As a result, the highest pay-out ratio would
only be 16%. Consequently, reserves and unappropriated surplus would in-
crease from ColS 5.6 million in 1971, to Col$ 23.8 million in 1976, equiv-
alent to a satisfactory 11% of total portfolio in 1976. Due to the low
dividends projected, book value of shares would increase from 128% of par
in 1971 to 179.3% of par in 1976.
30.       Caribe does not project full utilization of its borrowing capacity
with its debt to equity ratio increasing from 0.9:1 in 1971 to 3.6:1 at the
end of 1976. Its policy statement specifies a debt equity limit of 20:1.



APPENDIX G
Page 7
If Caribe is to participate in the proposed loan, like the other new finan-
cieras it would need to limit this ratio to 3:1 until its net worth exceeds
Col$ 35 million, and to 4:1 thereafter. Caribe has indicated it would change
the debt/equity provision to 3:1 if it becomes eligible for Bank funds.
31.       Caribe's debt service coverage implied by the projections, would be
satisfactory. During the projected period, collections on loans are ex-
pected to amount to a minimum of 2.4 times the amount of repayments on debts.
Profits before financial expenses will be more than 1.4 times interest pay-
able.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
32.       Conclusions.  Caribe is controlled by foreign interests, in partic-
ular by the Dutch Algemene Bank group. The financiera has been predominantly
extending short-term working capital loans based on the board's knowledge of
the borrower or of the security put up for the loan.  Its experience in formal
appraisal of long-term investments is therefore very limited. W4hile manage-
ment on the presidential and vice-presidential levels and staff have changed,
Caribe lacks effective management, and sufficient staff and experience. Its
appraisal capacity -- as shown in recent evaluations of long-term proposals --
and follow-up capability are not yet adequate for term lending. The same is
true of its disbursement and procurement procedures. Apparently, Caribe in-
tends to introduce procedures laid down in an operating manual to overcome
the shortcomings.
33.       Caribe's financial position is solid.  Its portfolio is of good
quality; arrearage minimal and its loans are generally adequately covered by
collateral. Portfolio coverage by reserves is more than adequate. Due to high
adninistrative costs and low financial leverage, Caribe's profitability has
remained somewhat low, but has shown a tendency to increase.
34.       Prospects for growing short and long-term operations are good pro-
vided that Caribe obtains effective management and adequate staff. If Caribe
is given access to the proposed Bank loan, it would enable it to embark on
long-term financing on a larger scale.
35.       Recommendations.  Given its present lack of adequate management,
limited capability for appraisal and follow-up and organization shortcomings,
Caribe's participation in the proposed loan could only be recommended if
BR's reappraisal shows: (a) the installation of effective management; (b)
demonstration of adequate project appraisal and supervision capacity; (c)
adequate internal procedures, including those for procurement disbursement;
and (d) introduction of 3:1 debt/equity ratio in Caribe's Policy Statement.

to use such funds for the purposes described in the Corpora-
ci6n's general credit policy.
(c)      It shall act as an intermediary, on commission, in placing
securities issued by private Colombian enterprises, with a
view to attracting private investors.
(d)      It shall issue bonds and other securities authorized by law,
taking full advantage of its own standing and the confidence
it enjoys on the domestic economic scene, and shall, in addi-
tion, act as an intermediary .or issuing and placing on the

(a)      It shall use its economic development reserves and other resources
of its own for capital investments (subject to the limitations
set forth in paragraph VII) and for loans with a maturity of
five or more years. It shall constantly aim to increase its
investments in medium and long-term credits and in capital invest-
ments, subject to the restriction in paragraph VII.
(b)      The total direct or indirect credits granted by the Corporacion
to any natural or juridical person and the guarantees it extends
for any one person may not exceed one tenth of the Corporacion's
paid-in capital and legal reserve.
The total obligation of any one person to the Corporacion, in-
cluding guarantees, may exceed that limit, but may not exceed
25A of the paid-in capital and legal reserve, when it arises from
documentary credits and the respective documents are endorsed to
the Corporaci6n without reservation, or when such obligations, to
the extent that they exceed one tenth but not 25% of the paid-in
capital and legal reserve of the Corporaci6n, are backed by real
guarantees of a commercial value that is sufficient to adequately
cover the total obligation so guaranteed.

7.      Save in situtations of a temporary character, future participation by
the Corporaci6n in the capital of an enterprise shall never be so large
as to cause it to assume direct responsibility for managing the enterprise.
This means that the Corporaci6n's participation in the subscribed capital
of enterprises should not normally exceed 15% of such subscribed capital.

value of its net paid-in capital and legal reserve.
The Corporacion shall try to protect itself adequately against any ex-
change risks that may arise from its operations.

CORPORACION FINANCIERA DE SANTANDER
INTRODUCTION
1.        Santander was formed in 1966 by a group of private and public
Colombian shareholders to finance and promote private enterprises in the
industrial, agricultural, mining and tourism sectors, particularly in the
Santander region. Santander's offices are in Bucaramanga, the capital of
the Department of Santander.  Its most industrialized centers are the town-s
of Bucaramanga and Barrancabermeja. The Department's contribution to total
value added in Colombia in 1967 was 5.4%, and it provided 4.1% of the total
employment in manufacturing.
2.        Share Capital and Ownership.  In 1969, Valores del Norte and
Banco Santander, two companies belonging to the Santo Domingo group, which
has controlling interests in some of Colombia's largest enterprises, bought
a majority of Santander's shares. At the end of 1971, the group held 617
of the Col$23 million paid-in share capital, 94 private shareholders, includ-
ing the Federacion, owned 27%, and two public shareholders, 11% (Annex 1).
In 1972, share capital increased to Col$24.2 million -- without ant sub-
stantial change in ownership.
3.         Board, Management and Staff.  Santander's board (Annex 2), is
elected for two-year periods and usually meets about once or twice monthly.
Of the seven directors (each with two alternates), the four who attend most
regularly represent the Santo Domingo group. Miost of the board members are
well known local industrialists and businessmen.
4.        The company's by-laws do not define whether it is the board's
or the President's responsibility to approve loans, nor has the board de-
fined a limit for loans the President may approve. In practice, loan
requests are approved by the board although the President sometimes approves
loans which are later confirmed by the board. Moreover, all equity invest-
ments in excess of Col$500,000 are approved by a presidential committee,
comprising the Chairman of the Board, two board members and Santander's
President. Santander should define clearly responsibility for all loan
investment approvals.
5.        Mr. Lievano, Santander's President since inception, is a well-
known and respected Bucaramanga businessman and banker. His intimate
knowledge of local business is very useful for the type of short-term
working capital loans which form almost all of Santander's business. How-
ever, the President does not get deeply involved in the day-to-day operations
of the financiera -- perhaps because he is not very familiar with financial
and technical matters. This means that, as head of a small financiera in-
tending to be involved in long-term lending, he would have to be supported
by suitable staff.



APPENDIX H
Page 2
6.        Annex 3 shows Santander's organization chart.  Santander's small
professional staff of three (of a total staff of thirteen) includes an
economist, a financial analyst and a lawyer. All three are young, have
limited experience, and to work more satisfactorily they would require
close supervision. Santander's staff has inadequate capacity for ap-
praising term lending projects. The financiera considers that it can
rely on the local university for this purpose, particularly for evaluat-
ing engineering matters for which Santander has no staff. While the
university could be used for preparing feasibility studies, Santander
still would have to build up capacity for evaluating these studies.
7.        Appraisal and Follow-up.  Most of Santander's lending has been
short-term working capital loans to existing enterprises, often based only
on the board's knowledge of its borrower and the security provided. Up
to now, Santander has hardly engaged in appraising proposals for long-term
financing. Most of its appraisals for short-term lending contain neither
analyses of the borrowers' financial position nor financial statements.
8.        The main purpose of the few and irregular supervision visits
Santander makes is to check the existence of guarantees. Financial and
operational information is scarce on most of its borrowers. Moreover, the
financiera hardly has the necessary capacity to give technical assistance
to its clients.
9.        Given the lack of experience of Santander's present staff and
the need to provide the President with strong support, it would appear
that a Technical Vice-President with ample experience in project appraisal
and supervision would be necessary. Moreover, the company should try to
engage an engineer with substantial industrial experience.
10.       Procurement and Disbursement Procedures.  At present, the
financiera does not control the procurement practices of its borrowers.
loreover, disbursement procedures do not provide sufficient checks to
ensure that funds will be used for the purposes intended, particularly
in the case of loans for financing construction.
OPERATIONS
11.       Lending Operations.  In 1971, its fifth year of operation,
Santander's loan approvals amounted to Col$79.3 million, compared to
Col$69.6 million in 1970, and Col$60.7 million in 1969, resulting in a
relatively low average increase of 14% yearly (Annex 4). As most of
Santander's financing has been for short-term working capital loans, and
its contracts were concluded immediately before disbursement, disburse-
ment figures equal approvals and commitments for each year. The moderate
growth in disbursements led to a 21% increase in loans outstanding during
1971, from Col$72.8 million to Col$88.1 million.



APPENDIX H
Page 3
12.       Santander's lending has been characterized by a predominance of
small, short-term working capital loans to existing enterprises. Since
inception, the average loan size has been Col$342,000, with 54% of loans
committed under Col$500,000, and the largest loan only Col$6.2 million.
Of loans committed, 78% were for terms of less than two years, and only
5% for more than five years. Of loan commitments, 96% have been for
financing working capital and only 4% for fixed assets, while 99% were
for existing companies and only 1% for new projects. A sector break-
down of loan commitments shows 62% for manufacturing industries and 25%
for construction and real estate.  The bulk of Santander's lending (90%)
has been to the local Department of Santander.
13.       Equity Investments.  In the past, Santander has not been very
promotion-minded, as it has made only seven equity investments (Annex 5),
totaling Col$4.3 million in 1971 (and Col$8.3 million in 1972). Two of
these, Ladrillera Bucaramanga and Caseoducto de Santander, both in opera-
tion, represent the bulk of its portfolio, while the rest are small invest-
ments in promotional companies. At the end of 1971, the equity portfolio
accounted for 5% of Santander's total loan and equity investments and
equalled 13% of its own equity.
14.       Other Operations.  In addition to its regular lending operations,
Santander finances letters of credit and exports, and provides guarantees.
At the end of 1971, letter of credit and export financing outstanding
amounted to Col$5.1 million, and guarantees, to Col$2.6 million.
15.       Policies.  Santander's board has approved the Policy Statement
shown in Annex 8. It contains all the provisions generally usual to devel-
opment finance companies connected with the Bank Group, and is similar to
those of the five financieras. At present, Santander holds more than the
25% -- to which it would normally limit itself - of the voting shares of
two promotion companies. With regard to its 61% ownership of a hotel
promotion company, its share of the hotel, if promoted, will be less than
25%. The purpose of the other company, of which Santander holds 33%, is
to stimulate local industry.
FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS
16.       Resources.  Since inception to the end of 1971, Santander
financed 69% of its operations from its oxwn capital. The bulk of
Santander's term debt comes from BR (Col$16.6 million at the end of
1971) which it mainly employed for medium-term financing. It raised
Col$11.3 million through issues of its own bonds as of end 1971. Of the
US$3.5 million in short-term foreign exchange credit lines available from
13 foreign commercial banks, US$1.4 million were utilized, largely for
working capital financing. Resources which Santander could use for term
lending are from its own equity, its bond issues, and from BR's general funds.



APPENDIX H

17.       Financial Structure.  Unaudited income statements and balance
sheets for Santander's first five years, 1967-71, are given in Annex 6.
Total assets at the end of 1971, stood at Col$107.4 million up 25% from
the previous year while the debt to equity ratio increased only slightly
to 2.4:1, due to a Col$2.3 million share capital increase in 1971. The
current ratio was 1.3:1, indicating satisfactory liquidity. As total
assets rose by only 7% to Col$114.6 million in 1972, Santander's debt/
equity ratio only rose to 2.7:1.  Santander's financial structure is
sound.
18.       Income, Expenses and Profitability.  In 1971, Santander's net
profit after taxes was a satisfactory Col$4.4 million, up 29% from
Col$3.4 million in 1970. Profit virtually remained at the 1971 level in
1972. The table below shows the development of income and expenditures,
expressed as percentages of average total assets:
1968     1969      1970     1971
Gross income                           13.2      14.0     14.7      13.8
Financial expenses                      2.2      3.3       4.1       3.9
11.0     10.7      10.6      9.9
Administrative expenses                 4.8       3.0      3.1       2.8
Profit before tax                       6.2       7.7      7.5       7.1
Tax                                     1.9       2.6      2.9       2.4
Prof-t after tax                        4.3       5.1      4.6       4.7
The level of administrative expenses, 2.8% of average total assets in 1971-
72, is somewhat high reflecting the relatively small size of Santander's
operations. In spite of this, the financiera has shown a satisfactory but
not yet very attractive return on investment. Income came almost entirely
from lending operations, with return on average equity portfolio amounting
only to 1.2% in 1971. Net profit before taxes, as a percentage of average
net worth was 22%; in 1970 and 1971, xwhile profit after taxes on year-end
share capital increased from 16.9% in 1970, to 18.7% in 1971.
19.       Quality of Loan and Investment Portfolios.   At the end
of 1971, Santander had loans of Col$2.6 million in arrears of more than
three ronths outstanding with companies with poor or uncertain prospects,
who~_- total loans from the financiera amounted to Col$9.7 million, equiv-
alent to 11% of its loan portfolio. This included Col$1.2 million to
three companies which subsequently went into liquidation. The largest
of the loans in difficulties, of Col$4.5 million, to Ladrillera Bucara-
manga in which Santander has an equity investment was rescheduled; other
reschedulings, amounting to Col$3.4 million, were simply the roll-over
of short-term financing to companies not in financial difficulties. Losses
on the loan portfolio are likely to be small since, with the exception of
Ladrillera Bucaramanga, security is adequate.



APPENDIX H
Page 5
20.       Santander's small equity portfolio (Annex 5), amounting to Col$4.3
million at the end of 1971 includes Col$1.4 million in one manufacturing
company (Ladrillera Bucaramanga), Col$2.1 million in a gas distribution
company and five promotional investments with uncertain prospects, in which
Santander has investments of Col$0.9 million. The brick manufacturer has
lost almost half its equity and is trying to turn around by entering new
lines of production.  The financiera expects to sell its investment in the
gas company, which is operating profitably.
21.       Reserves and Dividend Policy.  Santander, like the other financieras,
has no specific provisions for portfolio losses. It has, however, reserves
for bad debts of Col$169,000 and for losses on equity investments of Col$1.2
million. Moreover, its total reserves (including the legal reserve of
Col$1.8 million, which can only be used if Santander shows a loss in its
income statement) together with an unappropriated surplus, amounted to
Col$9.5 million, or 10% of Santander's loan and investment portfolio. At
present, this is adequate, since likely losses are significantly lower.
22.       Santander retained all earnings through 1969.  With the entry
of the Santo Domingo group as majority shareholder, Santander paid a 10%
dividend on share capital in 1970 and 1971, which amounted to pay-outs of
59% and 54%, respectively. The book value of Santander's shares reached
141% of par at the end of 1971.
23.       Foreign Exchange Risk.  All operations reviewed by the mission
indicate that Santander protects itself adequately against the foreign
exchange risk involved in its operations.
24.       Audit of Accounts.  Santander has no independent external audit.
Its Policy Statement foresees instituting an annual indeperi.dent audit, for
which it is considering using Arthur Young, Clarkson, Gordon & Co., or Price
Waterhouse.
PROSPECTS
25.       Santander's Business Forecast.  Santander projects (Annex 7)
that loan approvals will increase at a rate of 12% to 15% a year in the
period 1972-76, rising from Col$86.8 million in 1971, to Col$129.5 million
in 1976. Somewhat more ambitiously, Santander forecasts equity investments
of Col$4 million a year, largely in companies in which the Santo Domingo
group is in a majority position. The projected moderate growth of lend-
ing, which is somewhat below what Santander has experienced in the past,
should be attainable, particularly if there is sufficiently strengthened
management and staff for processing long-term loans using Bank funds. Re-
sults in 1972 fell short slightly of what had been projected for that year.
26.       Resource Needs.  Santander's projections assume that the
company will annually issue bonds for Col$2-3 million, use Col$5-7 million
of IFF and PIF funds, and place Col$5 million in shares with existing



APPENDIX H
Page 6
shareholders. Santander expects to use Col$24-34 million annually in short-
term credit from foreign commercial banks. Finally, it projects that it
will commit Col$63.8 million in Bank funds during the period. Bank re-
sources to meet 1973 and 1974 commitments would be equivalent to about US$1.0
million. It supports its long-term foreign exchange needs by a reasonable
project pipeline.
27.       Financial Projections.  If Santander's business and resources
develop as forecast, total assets and loan portfolio would grow 15-23%
annually from their Col$107.4 million and Col$90.1 million levels, respec-
tively, in 1971 and more than double during the five-year period. In-
creases in long-term lending, however, would be entirely financed by
Bank funds. Net profit after tax is projected to increase from Col$4.4
million in 1971, to Col$7.3 million in 1976.
28.       Assuming Col$5 million share capital increases yearly, profit
after taxes on year-end share capital would decline from 18.7% in 1971
to 15.4% in 1972 and stay approximately at that level thereafter, while
profit before tax on average equity would drop from 22.2% in 1971 to
20.1% in 1972 and reach 17.2% by 1976. The decline in profitability
would result from the very large yearly capital increases, which would
maintain Santander's present low 2.4:1 leverage practically throughout
the whole forecast period. Administrative expenses would decline from 2.4%
of average total assets in 1971 to 2.3% in 1972 and reach 1.8% by 1976, which
is somewhat slow, owing to the relatively slow growth in projected assets.
29.       Dividends on par value are projected 10% each for 1972 and
1973, equivalent to 60% and 64% pay-out ratios, respectively. Starting
in 1974, the projected dividends are reduced to 8% annually to keep
the pay-out ratios to a maximum of 55%. In view of the declining re-
turns to the shareholders they imply, the capital increases projected
above appear somewhat unrealistic.
30.       Reserves and unappropriated surplus would increase from
Col$9.5 million in 1971, to Col$11.4 million in 1972, and reach
Col$22.3 million in 1976, with their relationship to the total loan
and equity portfolio remaining at about a satisfactory 10% throughout
the period.
31.       Projected debt service coverage would be satisfactory.  Col-
lections on loans are expected to amount to a minimum of 2.6 times the
amount of repayments on debts, and profits before financial expenses
would be more than 1.7 times interest payable.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMENDATIONS
32.       Conclusions.  Santander has been extending primarily short-term
working capital loans, based on its knowledge of borrowers or on the security



APPENDIX H
Page 7
provided, and has thereby achieved adequate levels of profitability and
dividends, which, however, are still somewhat low compared to those of
the established financieras. Although a relatively high proportion of its
loan portfolio is with companies in difficulties, most of Santander's
exposure is well secured, and expected losses are therefore small.
Moreover, its reserves are large enough to cover any losses that can be
expected on the loan and equity portfolio.
33.       Prospects of achieving the relatively moderate growth Santander
projects are good, particularly if it has access to Bank funds. However,
this would require tnore effective management and adequate staff to appraise
and supervise long-term investment projects. Lack of financial analysis
and engineering capacity is most pressing. At present, procedures are
deficient, as there is no check on the procurement practices of its
borrowers, and its disbursements procedures are inadequate.
34.       Recommendations.  In view of its insufficiencies in management
and staff regarding appraisal and follow-up and its inadequate procedures,
participation of Santander in the proposed loan is recommended only if a
reappraisal by BR shows that: (a) Santander's management has been strength-
ened by, as a minimum, the addition of a senior staff member, perhaps a
vice-president, with ample experience in project appraisal and supervision;
(b) its staff has adequate capability for appraising and supervising projects;
and (c) adequate procedures, including those for procurement and disbursement,
have been introduced.
