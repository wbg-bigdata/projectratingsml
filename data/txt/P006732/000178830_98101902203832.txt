INTERNATIONAL BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION OF THE PRESIDENT
TO THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS ON
A PROPOSED LOAN TO
BANCO DE LA 2EPUBLICA
hITH GUARANTEE OF THE REPUBLIC OF COLOMBIA
FOR A FIFTH DEVELOPMET FThANCE COMPANIES PROJECT
1.        I submit the following report and recommendation on a proposed
loan to the Banco de la Repfiblica (BR) - the Central Bank of Colombia -
with the guarantee of the Republic of Colombia, for the equivalent of
US$60 million, the proceeds of which would be made available to eight
Colombian private development finance companies (Financieras). The term
of the loan would be a composite of the terms of individual investment
projects which will be up to 15 years, including grace periods not expected
to exceed three years. The interest rate would be 7-1/4 percent per annum.
The proceeds of the loan will be relent at 1O-3/4 percent interest if taken
in foreign exchange or at 20 percent interest if taken in pesos, as long as
the inflation rate in Colombia stays between 12 and 16 percent. If the
rate of inflation departs from the aforementioned range, new terms of
relending in.pesos will have to be agreed upon between the Bank, the
Borrower, and the Government.
PART I: THE ECONOMY
2.        The Bank's most recent economic report (Economic Position and
Prospects of Colombia) (R 72-21) was distributed to the Executive Directors
on May 18, 1973.
3.        ColombiA's econony is characterized first, by the problems resulting
from poverty and population pressures both in rural and urban areas and
secondly, by the foreign exchange constraint caused mainly by dependence
on one crop - coffee - for the majority of export earnings. Concentration
of land ownership, technical backwardness and poverty as well as severe
underemployment characterize most rural areas, with the exception of certain
enclaves of successful commercial farming. In urban areas, the pressures of
population growth, compounded by heavy migration from the countryside, create
a severe unemployment problem, In these urban areas, building and other
construction, and industry create substantial numbers of productive new jobs
but the speed at which this is possible cannot keep pace with the rapid
increase of urban population. Thus, many newcomers to the labor market have
had to find jobs in the service sector where underemployment is high, and a
large part of the rest remain unemployed.



aL.       A substantial measure of success has been achieved in coping with
Colombia's foreign exchange constraint through policies to encourage non-
traditional exports. Although Colombia has not freed itself from its
dependence on coffee exports, the rapid growth of non-traditional exports,
if continued, will achieve this result in the foreseeable future. 4ith
regard to the other major structural problems - rural poverty and urban
unemployment - no comparable success has been achieved so far. Recent
Government ardministrations have reacted to these basic problems in
a more systematic fashion than in the past but much remains to be done to
alleviate unemployment and poverty. In spite of the passage of an Agrarian
Reform Law in 1i961 and the creation of the Agrarian Reform Institute (INCO.A),
also in 1 961, only modest results have been achieved in the battle against
rural poverty. Also, until recently, no coherent policy frameworlc had been
deveioped to cope with urban problems, particularly unemployment. However,
evidence suggests that economic growth, as such, over the past ten years
has been sufficient to avoid a large increase in urban unemployment.
But it may prove difficult to maintain this situation if growth projections
for urban labor supply prove correct. To cope with this situation, the
Government has begun to shift the emphasis of its development strategy,
giving among other things far more emphasis to urban development, particu-
larly housing. Through this program it hopes to stimnlate a pattern of
demand that will maximize employment. The most recent Bank economic report
discusses this new strategy in detail.
5.        The near term outlook for the Colombian economny is somewhat un-
certain.  Output growth is strong and was somewhat above 7 percent in real
terms in 1972.  Coffee prices are high and shipments are moving well.  Non-
coffee exports continue to grow rapidly and their total value approached the
value of coffee shipments in 1'?72.  Merchandise export earnings in 1972 were
over US$500 million, some US$150 million above 1971 receipts, and net inter-
national reserves of the Bank of the Republic reached nearly US$477 million
(a historic high) at the end of March 1973. However, on the negative side, the
rate of price inflation has accelerated with consumer prices estimated to
have risen by about 11.4 percent during 1971 and 13.5 percent during 1972,
as compared with a 7.5 percent average increase for the 1967-70 period.
In these circumstances it is particularly importaint that Colombia continues
her policy of frequent exchange rate adjustments, in order to maintain the
momentum of non-traditional export growth.
6.        For the medium-term future two other developments could make the
management of Colombia's balance of payments more difficult. First, in
response to high prices, world coffee supply might increase substantially,
which would force coffee prices down. Second, it seems inevitable that by
1'975 or 1976 Colombia will have to begin importing crude petroleum on a
substantial scale since dormestic requirements for petroleum products are
rising far more rapidly than new oil reserves are being discovered in the
country. Thus, it remains crucially important for Colombia to maintain the
agricultural and industrial export drive to the fullest extent possible.



-3-
7         lDuring the five year period 19)66-72 current revenues of the
national governriment have risern at an average of 10 percent per anmnum in
real herms, and in 1'972 the national government generated some l)) percent
of Dublic sector current revenue.  Public investment is heavily (dcpendent
u1pon support from the national governmer]t, which in 1,72 financed 35 per-
cernt of the total public sector investment program, principally through
capital transfers to the decentraliz.ed agencies.  A combination of new
fiscal measures and high coffee prices is expected to resulL in hig.h
currerit revenues during 1 973, and1 tlhe cuLrrent surplus of the national
gover,nrent is projected to rise 17 percent in real terms.  This project,ion
is based on a presumed cof'fee price of 64 cents in New York, which in
present circumstances mav be considered conservative.  ftinanciaI support
for the public sector investment program should therefore be strong.
Beyond 1973 the strength of the national goverrment finances will dependt
upon new fiscal measures to maintain the momentum of current revenues.
E'ven within the frameworlk of existing tax legislation, however, the current
surplus of the national government is projected to rise by 5 percent in
real terms during 1974.
8.        Colombia's public debt service ratio is not high (1L4.6 percent
in 1972), relative to many other developing countries. If accelerated
economic growth continues, this ratio will rise and can be expected to
peak at about 26 percent in 1d83.  Public long-term external debt repayable
in foreign currency amounted to US42.2 billion at the end of 1972, or US$1.4
billion excluding undisbursed commitments. Should real growth of the
economy continue at roughly 7 percent per year, which appears feasible,
and should this be accompanied by a further strong expansion of non-coffee
exports and progress toward wider employment opportunities and an improved
distribution of personal income, Colombia should merit a considerable and
sustained inflow of long-term development capital.
PART II: BANK GROUP OPERATIONS IN COLOMBIA
9.        The proposed loan, whiclh would be the fifty-third made to Colombia,
would bring the total amount of Bank loans to Colombia to US$967.7 million
(net of cancellations). Of the foregoing amount, US$781.1 million is now
held by the Bank. IDA has made one credit of US$1 9.5 million for highways
in Colombia in 1961.
10.       Disbursements have been completed on 30 loans and the one IDA
credit. Of the 23 loans with undisbursed balances, progress is generally
satisfactory, although problems are encountered in various projects. IFC
has made investment and underwriting commitments in 27 enterprises in
Colombia, totalling about US$20.0 million of which IFC how holds US$10.2
million. Annex II contains a summary statement of Bank loans, the IDA
credit, and IFC investments as of March 31, 1973, and notes on the execution
of ongoing projects.



1 1 .     Bank disbursements as a percentage of total annual disbursements
by official lenders to Colombia are expected to peak at about 40 percent
in 1973-74 and then decline. The Bank's share of total debt service is
also projected to peak at about 31 percent in 197b-75, and the Bank group
share of total debt disbursed and outstanding is likely to fall from
28 percent in 1972 to 24 percent in 1978.
12.       Prospective Bank loans in an advanced stage of preparation are a third
education, a sixth railway and a water suppl;y project.  Over the past few years,
Bank lending in Colombia has expanded and become increasingly diversified and
the Bank has assumed greater responsibilities as head of the Consultative
Group for Colombia. Increasingly, projects involving loans in agriculture,
industry and the social sectors were developed. While so far our efforts in
these sectors have been mainly production-oriented in support of economic
growth and related export expansion objectives, we are now seekcing to develop
projects in such a way as to combine increasing output with maximum benefits
in terms of employment and improving the income of the poor, particularly in
rural areas. Such further shift in emphasis of Bank lending, however, will
require a new approach in many instances and hence, project preparation and
appraisal are likely to be more time-consuming.   Also, at least in the initial
stage, such projects are likely to be of much smaller size than the tradi-
tional large infrastructure projects.
13.       We expect over the next several years to make an increasing con-
tribution to the agricultural and industrial sectors, with perhaps as much
as 60 percent of our total lending in those two sectors. In evaluating the
suitability of projects for Bank lending, four major objectives would be
pursued: efficient growth of output; creation of employment; improvements
for the lower income groups; and potential contribution to foreign exchange
earnings or savings.
14.       The other major focus of our activities would be in such social
sectors as education and water supply, as well as in other project areas such
as the traditional sectors of Bank lending - electric power and transportation -
whenever important institution-building objectives can be achieved. In
addition, in formulating conditions for lending, the Bank would continue to
cooperate with the Government in its efforts to improve the fiscal system
and in developing institutions capable of increasing public savings.
15.        The operations of external lenders in Colombia are shown in Annex
I, page 3. While IBRD, IDB, and AID provided about four-fifths of the total
external financing to Colombia in the 1961-71 period, their share decreased to
53 percent in 1972. This reflects the Government's decision to diversify its
sources of external financing mainly through medium and long-term borrowing
from commercial banks and by issuing bonds abroad. The IDB has assisted



projects in low-cost housing, university education, agrarian reform, ports,
electric power, water supply, transportation, and industry. AID has shifted
the emphasis of its lending in recent years from program to sector loans,
particularly for education, urban development, and agriculture.
PART III: INDUSTRY IN COLOMBIA
16.       Over the last decade, industrial development in Colombia has made
good progress. Manufacturing (excluding handicraft) has slowly increased its
contribution to GDP from about 14 percent in 1960 to about 17 percent in 1971,
and industrial growth continues to be somewhat faster than overall economic
growth.  Originally, industrial development policy was oriented entirely toward
import substitution, but in recent years industry has begun to contribute
substantially to the rapid increase in non-traditional exports, which partly
reflects the fact that Colombia has an active entrepreneurial class; and
its industry, in spite of protection, has managed to achieve a reasonable
level of efficiency in many subsectors.
17.       Colombia has an urban and regional structure which is unique in
Latin America. The centers of development are widely dispersed throughout
the country because, until recently, Colombia's difficult geography enforced
the semi-isolation of regions and led to the growth of decentralized urban
centers. In contrast to the monocentric urban structure of many Latin Ameri-
can countries, Colombia has four major centers (BogotA, Medellin, Barranquilla,
and Cali) of over 500,000 inhabitants each, and 100 urban centers with over
10,000 inhabitants. Industrial production in Colombia, unlike that in other
Latin American countries, is distributed among the four major urban centers
and several smaller industrial cities, and thus the direct effect of industrial-
ization and its multiplier effects reach a larger share of total population
than in developing countries with only one predominant industrial center.
18.       Industry's direct contribution to increased employment, however,
has been modest, i.e. the rate of increase in industrial employment Just kept
pace with the overall increase of employment in all sectors excluding agricul-
ture. Its indirect contribution, particularly to employment growth in the
modern part of the service sector (banking, wholesale and retail trade, trans-
port, repair and maintenance, etc.) has probably been substantial, although
statistically unmeasurable. At any rate, judging from experience in the
majority of cities in the developed countries, it seems that in the longer run
the urban unemployment problem cannot be solved without rapid industrialization.
19.       Until recent years, Colombia's industrialization policies were
limited largely to a few standard policy measures to encourage import substi-
tution. These included import licencing, tariff protection for domestic industry
and some tax incentives, which have been largely ineffective. In recent years,
a number of export promotion measures, such as a tax credit certificate (15 per-
cent of fob export price) and exemption from tariffs of imported inputs for
export products, have been added. On the other hand, the credit system has
traditionally been regulated in favor of agriculture, housing and the public



-6-
sector.  Thus, industry and commerce pay substantially higher interest rates
than other sectors.  These regulations have developedl as a result of an almost
constant shortage of capital and have reflected the absence of comprehensi-ve
policies to develop the capital market. I'he high concentration of wealth and
share ownership, the heavy competition for savings combined with effective
official ceilings on interest rates, and the large share of their assets that
financial institutions must invest in certain govermnent prescribed sectors
have all contributed to restrict the development of a functioning capital market.
20.       The extent to which industrial investment has suffered from this
situation, as well as from the frequent shortages of foreign exchange is dif-
ficult to determine but available evidence suggests that serious shortages oL
funds, both for short and long-term purposes, have occurred fairly frequently.
Although smaller firms have been affected. most by these shortages, the speed
with which external loans to this sector have been comritted indicates thiat
demand has far outstripped supply throughout the whole sector.
21.       'rhe Bank 's involvement with industrial financing started in, 1  16, wnen
the Bank supported the creation of the Private Investment itnd (PIF) wibhiri the
Barnco de la Repèiblica (BR), which was conceived as a means of inducing a sub-
stantial flow of external credit for medium arnd long-term finlancing of productive
investments i-n industry.  The PIF, which is administered by the BR's Depart-
ment of Development Credit (DDC), attracted suoport from members of the Con-
sultative Group for Colombia,, mainly the United States, Holland, and the Inter-
American Development Bank (IDB).   In kay 1966, the Bank participated in this
effort by making a loan of U',$25 millioin (Lean 4.51 -(C0) to BR, to be relent
to five "inancieras and to be used by them to finance the direct foreign
exchange costs of productive investment projects, mainly in the industrial
sector. 'She loan was committ,ed in about I H months.  A second loan, of U&h12.5 mil-
lion, made in May 1,968 (Loan 534-co) and a third loan, of US$25 million made
in June 1 969 (Loan 625-CO) for the same purpose were each disbursed ahead of
schedule. The fourth loan of U.S$40 million, made in May 1971 (Loan 742-CO),
was virtually fully committed within 15 months.
22.       with the number of commitments for subloans increasing rapidly, a
pattern emerged which - compared with the national pattern - showed a concen-
tration in the flow of Bank 'loan funds to the larger borrowers as well as to
certain industrial subsectors. She proposed loan incorporates features designed
to achieve a much wider distribution of Bank funds.
23.       The major objectives of Bank loans to the Colombian Financieras have
been to provide funds for productive industrial investment and thereby to broaden
Colombia's industrial base; to help in the development of sound and efficient
financial institutions; and to contribute to the overall development of the
capital market in Colombia. Industrial investment and output have grown satis-
factorily and a recent study of effective protection in Colombia shows that the
Bank's institution building efforts with regard to both the five older Finan-
cieras and the BR have been reasonably successful, as it appears that the
Financieras in general have been supporting the less protected subsectors of
industry while Bank funds have been relent for projects with even lower average
protection. Achievements in developing the capital market, however, have been
limited. The Bank economic mission that visited Colombia in October/Aovember
19,'72 made a special effort to analyze in some depth the overall problems of



the Colombian capital market. On the basis of this study, we hope to assist
the Government more effectively than in the past in its efforts to iiprove the
rational functioning of the capital narkxet and thus, to strengthen its role
in the economic allocation of resources in Colombia.   Also, as described below,
the proposed loan incorporates a new feature to encourage more intensive
mobilization of savings by the Financieras.
PART IV: THE PROJECT
24.       The proposed Bank loan would be made to the Banco de la aepublica. The
proceeds of the loan would be channelled through its Department of Development
Credit (DDC), as under previous Bank Financieras loans. In order to strengthen
more Financieras and broaden the group of sub-borrowers, the proposed loan
would provide for onlending not only to the five Financieras that participated
in former Bank loans, but also to three new ones, whose eligibility would be
determined on the basis of a financial and management appraisal by DDC. While
the role of DDC vis-a-vis the five Financieras would remain unchanged - i.e.,
it would review their financing requests only from a national economic poinlt
of view - under the new loan DDC would assume responsibility for reviewing
appraisals and for supervision of the new Financieras. It is hoped that,
over the next few years, this experience will help DDC to develop the capabi-
lity to assume such responsibilities vis-a-vis all Financieras. Loan nego-ti-
ations were held in March 1973. The Borrower's delegation was lead by
Dr. Gutierrez of the Banco de la Republica and the Government was represented
by Ambassador Botero Boshell. A loan and project summary is attached as Annex
III to this report and an appraisal report (65a-CO) is being circulated
separately to the Executive Directors.
Background of Financial Intermediaries
25.       the history of the five oldest Financieras, in each of which TFC
holds shares, is well known to the 13ank 'Iroup. They are Corporacion I`inan-
ciera (CF) Colombiana; which started operating in Bogota in 1959; CF i\acional
in Medellèn, 1?60; CF del Valle in Cali, 1-.62; CF de Caldas in Manizales.
1 962; and CF del Norte in Barranquilla, 1 ;64.  In addition bo these five
Financieras, the following three new ones were appraised by DDC with the
assistance of the Bank: CF de Occidente, operating in Pereira, since 1966;
CF de Santander in Bucaramanga, since 1967; and CF del Caribe in Bogota,
since 1968.  Of the latter, Occidente was found suitable for immediate
inclusion in the Bank loan. The other two new Financieras will be reappraised
by DDC as soon as they have taken the necessary measures to become eligible,
mainly related to strengthening their technical staff.
26.       The Financieras are important in the Colombian capital markcet.  As
jovernment policies in the past have tended to regulate credit from other inter-
mediaries to the advantage of sectors other than manufacturing, the Financieras
have grown rapidly over the past years and today account for a substantial
part of institutional long-term finance for industrial investment in Colombia.
The Financieras are a diverse group of institutions, having developed in
regions with marked differences in human and natural resource endowment and
industrial and business tradition. The largest of the five - Colombiana,
Nacional, and Valle - have established themselves in Colombia's financial
community on a countrywide basis, while the others are at present mainly of
local importance.



_ 8 -
Pol.1icies and P,anagement of DUC and Financial Intermediaries
27.       The operating polic:ies of the Financieras vary only slightly amnon
them arid are geared to three mnaini objectives: channelling of' resources to
oroductive uses in the private sector (mainly to industry);   improving the
quality of' financial management and of project appraisal; and rnakting a posi-
tive contribution to the development of the Colonbian capital market. The
Financieras' policy statements include the following main iteems:  (a) no
en-awement in real estate or housing operations;   (b) an increasinlg propnrtion
of resources should be used for equity investments, Loans with convertibl,le
features, and loans of longer term than five y,ears;  (c) tct;al equity invost-
ments should not exceed the value of the f7inanciera's own equity;  (d) (l-ans
to, equity in and guarantees for aiy single enterprise must not normally exceed
15 percent of the Financiera's equity and in no case 25 percent;   (e) a pru-
dent dividend policy would be pursuecl so as lo build-up adequate reserves;
i1f) the Financiera s debt-equity ratio must not exceed 6:1 in the case of
C'olombiana, liacional, Valle, and Norte, iJi'.4ie51 in the case of Caidas; and
,r) the Finarnciera will make an effort to contribute to the development of
the capital rnar-et by issuing its oa-,n securities (bonds sid equity) ancd b<y
revolvin- its equity portfolio.   All three new lFiinancieras recently ado-p.-I
pol-cy statements sJimilar to those ,f the five Financieras.
28.      These main guidelines of the Plnancieras' operating policies are
complemented on the economic side by DDC's guidelines for evaluating econumic
priorities of the Financieras' projects. DDC at present is using an evaluation
method giving different weights to six major policy objectives, namely
employment, earning foreign exchange, producing at internationally competitive
prices, location in backward regions, use of local raw material and improvement
of capacity utilization.  The highest weights are given to employment (30)
earning foreign exchange (30) and competitive prices (15). Within each cate-
gory weights are determined on the basis of specific scales. The employment
effect, for example, is measured by a scale of cos-t per job. Projects involving
cost per job of up to US$5,500 receive maximum weight, followed by a gradual
decline to US$21l,000 or more per job, which receives zero weight. DDC is
planning to graduaLly replace this method by a more sophisticated system
taking into account effective protection and internal rates of return, using
shadow prices if called for.
29.       DDC has competent management, and an adequate staff of financial
analysts and economists.  Its smaill engineering staff', however, will need
further strengthening as DMC'E responsibilities expand.   The five older
linancieras continue to have competent management.   Their organization and
operating procedures are generally satisfactory, although appraisal and follow-
up still leave room for further improvement. Compared to the five older
Financieras, the three new ones (Occidente, Santander, Caribe) to varying
degrees still require further strengthening of their management and organi-
zation. Occidente, which has already qualified for participation in the Bank
loan, has a small, but well-qualified   staff and capable management.  Despite
recent staff additions, Caribe and Santander still need further improvement.
particularly with regard to expanding and improving their appraisal and
supervision capacities.  Also, procurement and disbursement procedures need
further strengthening.

ownership, Capital Structture and liesource Position of Financial Intermediaries
30.       Ownership of the Financieras is increasingly Colombian.    bith the-
exception of Caribe, Colombians have a majority interest,and the older five
and Occidente are owned by relativelv large numbers of shareholders.    O1nly
among taldas, Caribe and Santander's, ownelrs are there groups with controllin5;
interests - the Federacion Nacional (le Cafeteros in the case of Galda, a
Dutch banking group in Caribe, ancd a Colombian group in Santander.   Iowever,
with the exception of Norte, the othler Financieras each have shareholder
groups of closely associated investors who can exercise substantial influence
on their operation.  Norte's ownership is quite widespread and no d'omrnant
group seems to exist within it.
31.       The capital structure anrd resource position of the five cIder
Pinancieras is fairly simlar, with equity accounting for 20-27 percent of
total liabilities and equity.   in the case of the three new Finaricieras,
equity represents higher shares of the total, ranging from 20 percenL, in
the case of Occidente, to 51 percent in the case of Caribe.    For. resources,
the five Financieras have relied heavily on funds from 3R (ranging from
1. percent of total liabilities and equity irn the case of Morte to 3)0 percent
in the case of Colombiana and Caldas)   and from the Bank (ranging fromt
13 percent in the case of Caldas to _37 percent of total liabilities in the
case of Norte).  They have also mokbilized domestic resources Thrcugh [heir
own equity (22.6 percent), air bonld issues (6.5 percent) and have o-btained
significant foreigr short-term credit (9.6 percent).   For the three new
Firancieras, own equity is -he single rnost important source of funds, averag-
irg one-third of their total resources at year-end 1971 . Occidente ra'se'
some 0ol$43 million through a five-year bond issue   ard Santrander placed
Col  1 million in bonds, while Zaribe has rnot yet used this source of fundS.
Past Operations of Financial Intermediaries
32.       Term peso loans, including financing of Imports with 3Bank and FPI
funds, represent the bulk (76 uercent) of the five Financieras lending oper-
ations; short-term foreign exchange lending accounts for the remainder.    itihl
regard to equity investments, the five Financieras - except for Caldas end
Colombiana up to 1Ω67 - were not very promotional; they made mainly invest-
ments in existing enterprises. Ulnderwriting activities have been limited,
partly in response to unfavorable experiences with such operations. Guarartee
operations also decreased over the past few years.
33.       The three new Financieras so far have made predominantly small,
short-term working capital loans to existing enterprises. Of the three,
Occidente has made the largest proportion of its total lending for fixed
capital (18 percent) and shows most clearly a trend for longer term loans
for this type of financing over the past three years. Access to the pro-
posed Bank loan would make all new Financieras predominantly term-lending
institutions.   Caribe and Santander so far have not invested significantly
in equity. Occidente has an equity portfolio amounting to almost half its
own equity; however, about half of this investment total is accounted for
by one company.



- 10 -
34.       All Minancieras derive most of their income from lending oi)crations;
only Nacional's income from equity investment exceeds 10 percent of tot;al
income.  The older companies, except for Galdas, have acceptable and growinr:
levels of profitability. Sinice their spreads on all flmds utilized are prac-
tically equal, differing profitability among the companies stems largely from
differences in leverage, size and maturiLy of equity investment portfolios,
and in administrative costs. The three new Financieras' profitability, thilogh
still low, was acceptable considerirng their low leverage arid relatively high
administrative costs in the early years of their operation.   Except foDr Ucci-
dente, all Financieras maintained prudent pay-out ratios.
35.       The five older companies in general have adhered to their pollc,;
statements, although there have been some exceptions:  Caldas, Colombiana,
and Norte lhave made loans and. equity investments to single clients in excuss
of 25 percent of the net worth of each Financiera, und Caldas has made equ:ity
investinents in excess of its total equity.  Hlowever, the Financieras concerned
are making efforts toward reducing, and finally elimiLnating, this non-compliance.
All five Financieras have remained within their debt/equity limitations as
set by their policy statements.
36.      With the exception of Caldas, the IJtinancieras' loan, equity ald
guarantee portfolios range between satisfacUory and excellent in quality.  In
the earlier years of its operations Caldas -was very promotional in an environ-
ment which largely lacked business, and particularly industrial, tradition.
It has suffered severe portfolio losses and f'or an extended period of time,
will have to face substantial additional write-offs. However, with the
support of -the Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros, the major shareholder, the
company is recovering slowly, although it will have to retain all its earnings
for the next several years in order to strengthen its financial position.
Projected Operations of the Financial Intermediaries
37.       In their projections, particularly of their local currency needs,
all Financieras considered availability of resources rather than demand for
industrial financing to be the major constraint on increasing their fixed
and working capital financing. This is justified in an environment where
even prime companies need to resort extensively to the extra-bank market and
businessmen are willing to accept substantial increases in the effective cost
of funds through commissions, fees, compensating balances and other mechanisms,
indicating industry's ever increasing demand for funds.
38.       With this general expectation of continuing strong demand for
industrial finance, the Financieras have projected their peso loan commitments -
excluding Bank financing taken in pesos - at about Col$2.8 billion through
1974. The funds to cover these needs would be raised mainly through bond
and share issues, internal cash generation, and from BR. The foreign exchange
needs of the five older Financieras through mid 1975 have been estimated as
follows:

(a) US$'30 million would be ailuL,.ated as follows:

US$1 million to each of the -three new Financieras; alni
(ii) US$10 million arn iL.i2 million, respectively,; to the
five Financieras andI the three newf Financieras for use
on a first-come, first-served basis by any individual
Financiera which hlad uSed its allocation.
(b) The remaining US$30 million would be allocated to a "common pool"
for use on a first-come, first-served basis by any Financiera
but only after the Financieras as a group have mobilized an
additional Col$250 million in local resources through bond and
share placements. At that time, any amounts uncommitted under
(a)(ii) above would be added to the "common pool.,' Caribe's and
Santander's allocations would also revert to this pool if they
are found ineligible to participate in the loan.
41.       In relending the Bank's funds, the five Financieras have to some
extent concentrated on larger clients. Over one-quarter of the previous
foiir Rank loans totalling US,1 02.5 million went to five companies, which
1/  Based on the Financieras' expectations regarding investment climate,
awareness of their borrowers' expansion plans, plans to seek out new
borrowers, and past experience of growth in applications.

for total Bank financing to any one borrower.

C. PROJECTS IN EXECUTION L/
Summarized below is the current status of all loans signed but
not fully disbursed:
Loan 502 - Irrigation (Atlantico I), US$9 million, June 1967.
Implementation of the project financed under loan 502-CO remains
two years behind schedule due to difficulties in the selection of
areas suitable for irrigation and technical problems in the
construction of major irrigation and drainage works. As a
consequence of this and poor project management, agricultural
development is still limited to a small area and mainly restricted
to dry farming. However, the few agricultural results obtained
on a small number of farms are very promising. To complete the
scheduled works, a second extension of the closing date by one
year beyond the revised closing date of December 31, 1973 may
become necessary.
Loan 534 - Development Finance Companies II, US$12.5 million, May 1968.
This loan is fully committed for approved sub-projects, and
the undisbursed balance of US$0.4 million is expected to be
completely disbursed by the June 30, 1973 Closing Date.
Loan 536 - Water Supply (BogotA I), US$14 million, June 1968.
The major part of the First Bogota Project is in operation.
Water service in most areas with poor service is rapidly
improving. The operating performance of the Empresas is
good. The remaining works are proceeding at a pace partly
adjusted to needs dictated by the borrowing entity's temporary
budget constraints, but should be completed between mid- and
end 1973. The budget constraints are the results of apparently
temporary shortfalls in projected borrowing sources and lower
than predicted water sales (see loan 741-CO).
Loan 537 - Electric Power (Bogota), US$18 million, June 1968.
The project financed by this loan is substantially completed.
Lower' than anticipated participation of joint financing agencies
together with foreign cost increases due to the devaluation
of the U.S. dollar led to a re-allocation of funds in mid-1972
among the loan categories. Delays in the definition of the
distribution expansions have caused late bidding for dis-
tribution equipment. The Closing Date has been extended to
the end of 1973 to allow completion of the project.
1/ These notes are designed to inform the Executive Directors regarding the
progress of projects in execution, and in particular to report any problems
which are being encountered, and the action being taken to remedy them.
They should be read in this sense, and with the understanding that they
do not purport to present a balanced evaluation of strengths and weaknesses
in project execution.

Loan 550 - Highway V, US$17.2 million, July 1968.
There have been substantial cost overruns and delays in the
civil works financ:ed under this loan. The project is about
60 percent complete; the present closing date of June 30, 1973,
already postponed for one year from the original, will need
a further one year postponement.
Loan 552 - Education I, US$7.6 million, July 1968.
School construction is virtually completed but the procurement
of furniture and equipment is seriously delayed. The executing
entity for the project has promised to strengthen its procure-
ment unit. The Closing Date has been extended a second time
to June 30, 1973. The supply of qualified teachers for some
technical subjects remains insufficient; facilities for their
training would be included in a third education project which
has recently been appraised.
Loan 575 - Electric Power (Interconnection), US$18 million, December 1968.
The project as originally described in the Loan Agreement
started operation in November 1'971. Mainly due to the fact
that the joint financing arrangements raised more funds than
expected during the appraisal, the 230 KV line Guatape-
Barrancabermeja, which will incorporate the northeastern
region into the interconnected system, was included in the
loan. Completion of the extension is scheduled by mid-1974.
Loan 624 - Agricultural Credit II, US$17 million, June 1969.
The Project continues to be far behind schedule. After more
than three years of effectiveness only US$3.3 million of the
US$17 million loan amount have been disbursed. Recent changes
in Project management and organization and an increase in tech-
nical personnel provided the basis of the Bank's approval to
Colombia's request to enlarge the Project area and include
lending to small farmers under the Project.
Loan 625 - Development Finance Companies III, US$25 million, June 1969.
US$24.9 million of this loan is committed for approved sub-
projects. To permit completion of disbursements the Bank has
agreed to extend the original Closing Date from September 30,
1972, to December 31, 1973.

Page   of' 7
Loan 651 - Livestock II, US.-l6.3 million, December 1969.
This Project moved slowly from effectiveness in M4arch 1971 until
mid-1972. In October, 1972, the B3ank and Caja agreed on rertain
modifications to the Project, including appointment of one
Project General Director wit}.h overall responsibility for the
Project, extension of tLc Prnjec'; area and greater flexibility
in regard to terms of siih-lendling. At the same time it was
agreed that increased suvb-lenldit-'J should be directed towards
small holders. These changes have resulted in an increase in
the rate of sub-lending under the Project.  It is now expected
that the Loan will be fully d-licbursed by mid 1976, about two
years later than the original appraisal estimate.
Loan 679 - Education II, US$6.5 million, June 1970.
Delays in procurement of furniture and equipment are responsible
for the slow rate of projeci; e- cution.  As indicated above Ior

Loan 680 - Highways VI, US$32 million, June 1970.
In general, there have 'seen substantial cost increases and
serious delays on the civil -works. The most serious problem
confronting the project relates to t;he financial difficulties
of the Colombian contracting incdustry, leading to a temrporary
halt in construction on several groups of the Paving Program.
In this situation, where some of Colombia's major contracting
firms were facing bankruptcy, the Government has recently
taken drastic steps to resuscitate operations. Estimnated cost
increases for civil works now amount to about 30 percent of
original contract amowuts, while consultant services will be
about double the original amount. Civil works are nearly
40 percent completed, but are about one year behind schedule.
The situation is more satisfactory on the other two elements
of the project, the construction of the Barranquilla bridge and
of the El Pailon-Buenaventura road.
Loan 681 - Electric Power (Chivor I), US$52.3 million, June 1970.
Progress of the main civil works contract is generally satisfac-
tory and in agreement with the contractual dates. Bidding for
the rest of the civil works financed by the Bank is proceeding
as planned. Higher than expected prices for equipment, due
partly to the revaluation of various European currencies and
the yen, together with changes in the access road program,
have substantially increased the total cost of the project.
Recently we have received a revised cost estimate and as of
October 1972 total project costs are estimated at US$140 million,
that is, about US$26 million more than estimated in the
Appraisal Report. ISA plans to finance the cost overruns

loan 682 -- Cali dater Supply and '- werage, MS.i 8 .5j million, June 1 970,
The project was delayed for ahoiit one year due mnir.nly to a
change in the Cali ilur!i`.LDa_ '.1CvCerr)men't that occurred after
1,he loan was signed.  ;e ho- ard of E.`O1CALI has recently ampoin L-;ed
a new manager anrd taRen rea3N!.Ial ac.ons . suggested by the Banlk
in order tc improve EMCALI s administrat.i ve capacity and

Loan 738 - Palminra Water Supply and Sewerzu!te, 'QtS$2 million, Ma.y 1 '71
Construction on this Project ivas delayed due to slow project
design and adrin:ist.rativ-e prob2om,t fitTh the con.sultan-ts and
the Borrower. Lower than articipated sales of water and a
shortfall in project.ed. local bor-rowng has resulted in an
unsatisfactory fi-nancial per: r ri e of the Borrower. As
a coinsequence the Ba-nic and iPiprosas Publicas Phunicipales
de Palmira are consideriu:,z t.he phSing of the project to
reflect the above mentionerd linaMCi1al constraints.
Loan 73', - Land Settlement Caquet'a I, US$8.1 million, May 1971.
During its first year, the project has achieved about 75 per-
cent of its appraisal objectives. Suiblending is being delay-ed
by the administrative procedures associated with cattle purchase
and the provision of technical assistance.   Arrangements are
being made to improve the organi,-ation, and there are prospects
that 1973 operations will, be on target.  The benefits from the
project are likely to be higher than appraisal projections
while the cost estimates are likely to be about the same as
envisaged at appraisal.
Loan 740 - Telecommunications II, US$15 million, May 1971.
Owing to the higher-than-expected price for toll ticketing
equipment, in part due to currency changes, the amount of the
loan will be insufficient to cover the cost of the items
originally included in the loan. TELECOM is presently exploring
the possibilities of obtaining additional funds, failing which
the purchase of some of the lower-priority equipment of the
project will have to be postponed.

Loan 741 - Water Supply (Bogota II), US$88 ]7illion, May 1 971.
The principal civil work component of this project, the Chingaza
tunnel construction is behind schedule. The Borrower is reviewing
the latest measures proposed by the contractors to improve.
performance. Recent information shows that revenue from water
sales is lower than forecasted. The Bank has suggested actions
to assure that this shortfall will not adversely affect the
financial performance of the Borrower.
Loan 742 - Development Finance Companies IV, US$40 million, Nay 1971.
Only US$0.7 million of this loan remain uncommitted.   Disburse-
ments are proceeding ahead of schedule.
Loan 642 - Development Program and Expansion Project, US$60 million,
June 1972.
The second tranche (US$30 million) of this loan was cancelled
because coffee prices exceeded the upper limit set in the
Loan Agreement for release of the second traiche.
Loan 849 - Irrigation (Atlantico II), US$5 million, June 1972.
This loan became effective on November 14, 1972.
Loan &60 - Medium-Size Cities Water Supply and Sewerage Project,
US$9.1 million, October 1972.
This loan became effective on March 7, 1973. The Borrower
has experienced difficulties in the initial phase of the project;
however, it is expected that the recent stationing of a Bank
water supply specialist in BogotA will help solve these
problems. Construction of several subprojects will begin
during the second quarter of 1973.
