         THIRD GOVERNANCE REFORM AND GROWTH CREDIT (GRGC-3)

                       FINANCING AND PROGRAM SUMMARY


Borrower:                 Government o f Sierra Leone.

ImplementingAgency:       Ministry o f Finance and Economic Development.

Financing Data:           IDA credit terms with a forty year maturity including a grace period o f
                          ten years.

Operation Type:           Programmatic, one tranche, development policy operation to be
                          disbursed upon effectiveness.
Main Policy Areas:        Public Financial Management, Public Sector Reform, Decentralization,
                          Energy.

Key Outcome Indicators:   The difference between the ratio o f actual to budgeted spending on
                          HIPCPRSP priorities and the ratio o f actual to budgeted expenditures
                          for all other discretionary primary expenditures, the number o f public
                          entities producing procurement plans for MOF approval, the share o f
                          procurement above the national small purchase threshold that was
                          conducted through open competition, the ability to verify selected
                          payroll entries, budgetary funds transferred to local councils expressed
                          as a share o f discretionary non-salary, non-interest recurrent spending,
                          public provision o f electricity to Freetown in megawatts, and N P A sales
                          collection.

Program Development       The proposed credit i s the third in a series o f three development policy
Objectives and            operations in support o f Sierra Leone's transition from post-conflict
Contribution to CAS:      recovery to sustainable development in the context o f i t s Poverty
                          Reduction Strategy (PRS). The operation includes reform measures in
                          support o f the following development objectives: (i)    preserve the fiscal
                          space needed for poverty reduction; (ii) promote efficiency,
                          transparency and accountability in the use o f public resources through
                          enhanced public financial management and governance; and (iii)           im-
                          prove the investment climate by ensuring the provision o f electricity in a
                          fiscally sustainable manner. The operation complements similar support
                          provided in these areas by the AfDB, DflD and the EC.

Risks:                    Several risks could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits o f
                          this operation, but measures are being taken to mitigate them. These
                          include: (i) macroeconomic shocks; (ii) weak institutional capacity and
                          corruption; and (iii) government's commitment to sustain the

                       implementation o f the reform program.

                       Risks from exogenous shocks are significant. These include a
                       prolongation o f the global recession, another rapid rise in international
                       commodity prices for food or fuel, a further decline in the country's
                       export prices, or new and unavoidable expenditure obligations. There i s
                       a small associated risk that the authorities might seek to finance a
                       stimulus package through inflationary money creation if other resources
                       are not available. The risks created by such shocks to macroeconomic
                       stability and PRS implementation are mitigated by the Government's
                       track record o f satisfactory macroeconomic performance and ongoing
                       intense dialogue o f the IMF, the World Bank and the multi-donor budget
                       support donors with the Government on macroeconomic policies and the
                       reform program. In addition, the Bank will continue to monitor the
                       impact o f the global recession and assess the need for further support,
                       such as the planned expansion o f the cash for work program.

                       Weak institutional capacity or corruption could hamper the
                       implementation o f the reforms supported by the proposed operation and
                       the broader Poverty Reduction Strategy. This risk was evident in late
                       2007 and early 2008 when capacity in the central ministries and local
                       councils was temporarily reduced as a consequence o f the natural
                       replacement o f various key officials as a result o f the political transition.
                       M O F E D officials indicated they have largely resolved the problem
                       through intensive dialogue and monitoring with the implementing
                       ministries and local councils. In addition, inadequate training in
                       procurement procedures could slow the effective broadening o f
                       procurement reform, and weak accounting skills in district governments
                       could make it harder to account for the use o f resources transferred to
                       local councils. These risks are mitigated by the choice and design o f the
                       supported measures which are calibrated to existing capacity, the
                       provision o f extensive technical assistance through ongoing or planned
                       projects (including support from the Institutional Reform and Capacity
                       Building Project for training in procurement and accounting skills) and
                       growing involvement o f civil society in oversight activities.

                       Weak government commitment, political opposition, or resistance from
                       vested interests can represent important obstacles to reform, especially
                       reforms that foster transparency and accountability in the use o f public
                       resources. Under the proposed operation, these risks are mitigated by
                       the fact that all policy measures are implemented before credit approval.
                       The commitment o f the Government, as exemplified by the progress
                       already made under the first and second operations in the programmatic
                       series, and continued Bank engagement also enhance the likelihood that
                       reforms are being followed through and policies sustained.

                          PROGRAM DOCUMENT FOR A
                THIRD GOVERNANCE REFORM AND GROWTH CREDIT

                            TO THE REPUBLIC OF SIERRA LEONE


                                        1. INTRODUCTION
1.1    This program document proposes a Third Governance Reform and Growth Credit
(GRGC-3) for SDR 6.4 million (US$lO million equivalent) to the Republic o f Sierra Leone. The
proposed Development Policy Operation, the last in a programmatic series o f three, aims to
support the authorities' efforts, in the midst o f the current global crisis, to maintain a sound and
sustainable fiscal stance and to protect the development objectives set forth in Sierra Leone's
second Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS).' The PRS emphasizes private sector growth to reduce
poverty, backed by public investments in infrastructure and the delivery o f basic social services,
along with continued improvements in the quality o f governance.

1.2     The proposed operation takes place at a very challenging time, as the Sierra Leonean
authorities deal with an unfavorable global environment, which sharply contrasts with i t s
generally positive post-conflict prospects. The global economic down-turn has weakened
economic prospects for 2009 and i s putting pressure on the fiscal position. The mining sector
has been particularly hard hit with declines in world market prices, delayed investments, and
scaled back production. Remittances are also projected to fall in 2009. Real GDP growth i s
projected to slow to 4 percent compared to an earlier forecast o f 5.5 percent, and revenues are
expected to fall short o f the original budget target mainly because o f declining exports and
imports and weaker income growth.

 1.3     The proposed operation would contribute to the government's efforts to maintain poverty
reducing spending and promote private sector growth in 2009 while safeguarding
macroeconomic stability. Specifically, it would support the government's efforts with reform
measures to: (i)                                                             i)
                    preserve the fiscal space needed for poverty reduction; ( ipromote efficiency,
transparency and accountability in the use o f public resources through enhanced public financial
management and governance; and (iii)       improve the investment climate by ensuring the provision
o f electricity in a fiscally sustainable manner.

1.4     The programmatic series, o f which this operation i s a part, i s aligned with the Bank's
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS). The programmatic series also builds upon a wide range o f
analytical work on public financial management as well as sectoral policies and outcomes and
complements similar support provided by the African Development Bank (AfDB), the United


 Sierra Leone's first PRSP was adopted by the Government in February 2005. The PRSP and the accompanying
 Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) was discussed by the World Bank Board o f Executive Directors on May 3,

(EC). Support from the donor community for Sierra Leone's programs has been quite strong.
Much o f this assistance came in the form o f direct budget support. In November 2006, the
AfDB, DflD, EC, the World Bank, and the government signed a Memorandum o f Understanding
establishing a framework for greater harmonization.2 This i s accompanied by a rolling annual
Progress Assessment Framework (PAF). The proposed operation's prior actions are a subset o f
this PAF and thus GRGC-3 i s fully harmonized with the budget support provided by the donors.


                                   2. COUNTRY CONTEXT

                              A. RECENT      DEVELOPMENTS
                                      ECONOMIC

 2.1     Following a period o f robust growth, economic activity and export demand weakened
 toward the end o f 2008 due to the global economic downturn and production problems in the
 mining sector, while inflation pressures subsided. Average real GDP growth, which had been
just above 7 percent per annum over the period 2004 through 2007, slowed to 5.5 percent in 2008
 (see Table 2.1 below). As noted in a recent analysis, the main source o f growth over the period
 2002 to 2007 was high post-conflict p r o d ~ c t i v i t y . The contribution to growth from the labor
                                                               ~
 force was 2.4 percent while physical capital contributed another 1.6 percent. Productivity growth
 contributed the remaining 6 percent. From a sector perspective, the main sources o f growth in
the economy have been agriculture and services due to their weight in the economy. In 2008,
 economic activity slowed down in the latter part o f the year, particularly in the mining sector,
 although agricultural production and the service sector remained buoyant.

2.2     The GDP share o f exports o f goods and non-factor services f e l l to 16.3 percent in 2008
from 20.8 percent in 2007 due to the global slowdown and the collapse o f operations in two
minesS4The external current account balance (including official transfers) worsened to -1 1.2
percent o f GDP in 2008 from -3.4 percent o f GDP in 2007 on account o f a rise in food and fuel
prices during the first half o f the year and lower diamond prices in the second half. Official
reserves in 2008 f e l l to US$209 million or 4.5 months o f import coverage, from US$215 million
in 2007. The current account balance was financed mainly by concessional external assistance
and debt relief. In December 2006, Sierra Leone reached the Completion Point under the
Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative and, in so doing, also gained
additional relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Taken together, the total
relief will amount to roughly US$l.6 billion in nominal terms spread over 30 years (see Section
2.C below on debt sustainability).

2.3     Fiscal policy was challenged by shortfalls in domestic revenue and delays in the
disbursement o f external assistance. As a result, the fiscal outcome in 2008 interrupted the trend
set in the previous seven years: the overall balance (after grants) had improved continuously

from -10.6 percent o f GDP in 2001 to -2.0 percent o f GDP by 2007.5 In contrast, the overall
balance in 2008 worsened to -4.8 percent o f GDP due to lower than expected (by 0.4 percent o f
GDP) collection o f import duties, excise taxes, mining taxes, and non-tax revenues. Half o f this
shortfall can be attributed to a decline in commodity prices which affected negatively customs
and mining revenues. Also, only 71 percent o f programmed budget support was disbursed in
2008 (a shortfall o f 1.8 percent o f GDP) due to delays in meeting benchmarks associated with
budget support. These shortfalls prompted the authorities to curtail recurrent expenditures by 0.6
percent o f GDP.

management i s on par with the average performance o f other IDA countries and identified
aspects o f public financial management (PFM) in need o f additional strengthening.

2.5     In 2007, reserve money growth exceeded the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Poverty
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program target (26 percent against 15.6 percent) due to
unexpectedly high bank reserves caused mainly by the establishment o f two new foreign banks.
In 2008, reserve money growth was 10 percent, below the program target o f 18 percent.
Increases in food prices, and the pass-through effects o f the increases in o i l prices resulted in an
acceleration o f inflation in 2007 and 2008. End of period inflation rates for food were 15 percent
and 19 percent respectively for 2007 and 2008. Inflationary pressures subsided, however, toward
the end o f 2008 due to the steep decline in import prices (mainly fuel). Thus, the average end o f
period inflation rate f e l l to 12.2 percent at end-2008, compared to 13.8 percent for the previous
year. Inflation declined to 7.5 percent at end-March 2009, driven mostly by lower food prices.

2.6      Since March 2008, the IMF had classified the exchange rate system as a "conventional
peg" system to reflect the relative stability o f the nominal exchange rate managed through weekly
auctions by the Bank o f Sierra Leone (BSL). In February 2009, the classification was changed to
"stabilized" due to the revision o f the classification methodology. The nominal exchange rate
depreciated in 2008 but not enough to offset inflation, thus generating a modest real annual
average appreciation o f 8 percent. The nominal, end-of-period rate on treasury bills f e l l
significantly to 9 percent in 2008 from 21 percent in 2007. This may be due to increased
competition from several new commercial banks established in 2007 and 2008.

                        B. MACROECONOMIC FOR 2009-2012
                                    OUTLOOK

2.7     Sierra Leone's economic conditions and prospects are being seriously affected by the
global economic downturn. The mining sector i s particularly hard hit, but other sectors are also
affected, including services and tourism. On the positive side, output growth should benefit from
an expected improvement in the supply o f electricity, ongoing efforts to increase agricultural
productivity, and public investments in infrastructure.

2.8    The terms o f trade are projected to move against Sierra Leone in 2009 by almost 7
percent. Diamond export prices have already fallen at an average rate o f 8 percent per month,
between January and June 2009, while imported rice prices f e l l at an average rate o f only 1
percent per month. Imported o i l prices, however, have been rising at an average rate o f 10
percent per month. The trend i s expected to be reversed in 2010 with the terms o f trade growing
by 2 percent, as the global recession abates, followed by 1.4 percent and 1.6 percent respectively
for 2011 and 2012. Remittances from abroad are projected to fall moderately from US$38
million in 2008 to US$35 million in 2009 before rebounding to US$55 million in 2010 and
US$65 million by 2012.

2.9     The decline in export prices has already led to a substantial reduction in exports, mainly
in the mining sector, where producers have scaled back activities. In this context, it i s notable
that the bauxite mine was closed down in March 2009 due to l o w world prices. Similarly,
diamond exports in the first half o f 2009 are below normal levels. Total exports have begun to



                                                  4
improve in the second half o f the year and are therefore projected to remain at 16 percent o f GDP
in 2009 before increasing to 19 percent o f GDP by 2012.

2.10 The shortfall in export receipts, relative to earlier years, combined with a reduction in
remittances from abroad, i s contributing to a slowing in economic activity with forecast real GDP
growth in 2009 reduced to 4 percent compared to an earlier forecast o f 5.5 percent made in the
fourth quarter o f 2008. It i s expected that the reduced world demand for Sierra Leone's exports
in 2009 will be partially compensated by robust growth in the agricultural sector which far
outweighs mining's contribution to real GDP and employment. Real GDP in 2010 i s forecast to
grow by 4.7 percent before recovering to 6 percent by 2012.

2.1 1 Domestic revenue in 2009 i s projected to decline by 0.2 percentage points o f GDP to 11.2
percent o f GDP (0.9 percent o f GDP less than the budget target) due to lower imports, a decline
in mining activity, weaker corporate income, and revenue policy slippages. The expected
revenue shortfall will be accommodated by identified additional external budget support, a
reduction in recurrent spending (mainly through a decline in domestic interest obligations), and
additional financing. As a result, the overall fiscal balance i s projected to worsen to -4.4 percent
o f GDP against the budget target o f -3.5 percent o f GDP, while the domestic primary fiscal
balance would worsen to -3.8 percent o f GDP compared to the budget target o f -1.4 percent o f
GDP.

2.12 Fiscal policy in the medium term will be geared towards reducing the domestic primary
fiscal deficit to -2.0 percent o f GDP by 2012. This i s expected to be achieved through increased
revenue mobilization efforts as the government aims to maintain macroeconomic stability while
also expanding investment spending to support the implementation o f the PRS. Several new tax
measures are planned, including the introduction o f a Value-Added Tax (referred by Government
as the Goods and Services Tax) in early 20 10. The National Revenue Authority i s implementing
six additional projects through a major modernization plan supported by D f f D and FIAS. These
include: a customs modernization project; an income tax modernization project; a gold and
diamond office (GDO) project; a non-tax revenue modernization project; a taxpayer
identification number (TIN) project; and an integrated revenue information system project. In
addition, as o f March 2009, to reduce the cost o f tax compliance, income tax returns may now be
self-assessed as in most developed countries.

2.13 The government aims to protect priority expenditure programs, particularly those which
contribute to poverty reduction, through better budget execution procedures. Prudent fiscal
policy will assist monetary policy in lowering inflation and ensuring that the domestic public
debt would remain at a sustainable level. Recourse to domestic credit from the central bank will
be restricted to MDRI savings. This w i l l provide scope for expanding private sector credit and
will contribute to lower domestic interest rates. This fiscal stance combined with prudent
monetary policy, lower commodity prices, and solid domestic food production would lead to a
reduction in the end o f period inflation rate to 6.0 percent in 2012 from 12.2 percent in 2008 and
projected rates o f 9.5 percent in 2009 and 8 percent in 2010.

2.14 The current account deficit i s expected to remain high at 9.4 percent o f GDP in 2009
compared to 11.2 percent o f GDP in 2008 and 3.4 percent o f GDP in 2007 mostly due to a


                                                 5
continued decline in export receipts. This trend i s expected to reverse in 2010 as the global
environment improves. Gross official reserves are expected to stabilize at 5.5 months o f import
cover by 20 12.

2.15 Cumulative external financing requirements for Sierra Leone are reviewed on a regular
basis as part o f the PRGF arrangement supported by the IMF. Financing requirements between
2009 and 201 1 are projected to be about US$802 million (see Table 2.2). The US$636 million
required for fiscal operations i s fully identified.6 This would come from US$431 million in
grants and US$206 million in loans. Financing for the BSL, via the second Three Year
Arrangement under the PRGF, will provide another US$48 million, including augmentation o f
access in 2009. Financing for all other activities would be provided by a combination o f foreign
direct investment and loans.

2.16 The macroeconomic policy framework set out above provides an adequate basis for the
proposed operation. The government has generally demonstrated a satisfactory track record in
maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies that are sustainable over the medium-term. The
framework i s supported by an IMF PRGF program approved in May 2006. The program i s
currently on-track: the fourth review was completed in June 2009.

2.17 There are some risks to the above framework associated with the second half o f 2009.
First, the impending completion o f the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Project (BHP), expected by
September 2009, would create substantial new fiscal space since expensive fuel expenditures
could be sharply reduced as could the power tariff. Savings could approach US$3.5 million
monthly as rental o f generators and procurement o f fuel would no longer be needed, improving
both the BOP and the fiscal account. The government has built these savings into the fiscal


 These numbers are consistent with implementation o f PRSP priorities under the macroeconomic fiamework agreed
 with the IMF on the basis o f identified external financing. Implementation o f the PRSP beyond core priorities will
 require additional financing.


                                                                 6
framework for 2009, yet there i s a risk that the start-up BHP power geneiation may be delayed
past September. A second risk comes from the resolution o f a problematic power sector contract.
The size o f the obligation has been substantially reduced but half o f the remaining US$12m
obligation i s to be paid in 2009 as an un-programmed expense. The other half i s to be paid in the
first half o f 2010. It i s unclear how this extra cost would be financed or if expenditure cuts will
be required, particularly in the context o f the uncertainty over BHP. Third, the exchange rate
depreciation caused by falling export receipts could magnify what now appears to be an upward
trend in the world price o f fuel and, possibly, food. This could boost inflation to uncomfortable
levels in addition to the impact o f the global recession on output and employment. An associated
risk i s the emergence o f a parallel market premium on the exchange rate, creating price
distortions, in the event that the authorities attempt to intervene in the foreign exchange market.

2.18 There are also risks for 2009 and 2010, if the recession lasts longer than expected or
deepens. For example, if the terms o f trade were to worsen by 10 percent in 2009 rather than the
expected 4 percent, and remain unchanged in 20 10 before gradually recovering in 20 11 and 20 12
(due to either steeper export price declines or larger fuel or food price increases), then real GDP
growth would slow by an additional percentage point in 2009 and an additional half percentage
point in 2010. This would reduce the tax base and the fiscal deficit would increase by 0.6
percentage points o f GDP in 2009 and 0.9 percentage points o f GDP in 2010 unless official
grants were increased, or approved expenditures were reduced, in compensation.

2.19 An associated risk comes from the possibility that the authorities might implement a
stimulus package financed from domestic borrowing in excess o f IMF program targets. While a
stimulus package i s desirable for poverty reduction, particularly in the mining areas, any
substantial financing through domestic borrowing would be inflationary and would accelerate the
ongoing currency depreciation (from 3,048 Le/US$ in January 2009 to well over 3,700 Le/US$
by October 2009), thus undermining the pro-poor aspects o f the intended stimulus. This risk is,
however, mitigated by the ongoing dialogue with the IMF.

2.20 A number o f factors could help mitigate the risks created by the global recession. In the
short-run, the government plans a moderate stimulus in 2009 from increased investment
spending at the local council level combined with an expansion o f the cash for work program
funded by the World Bank to national coverage. Output growth should also benefit from the
expected improvement in the supply o f electricity when the BHP begins generating electricity for
distribution. In the medium-term, PRS policies are intended to help diversify exports,
particularly with regard to agricultural products. This may help offset the losses in the mining
sector. Urban expenditures on fuel should be substantially reduced as low cost hydroelectric
power i s made available. This should help spur job creation and, as a secondary effect, increase
urban demand for rural products. Fiscal policy in the medium term will aim at increased revenue
mobilization efforts as the government aims to achieve macroeconomic stability while also
expanding investment spending to support the implementation o f the PRS. The introduction o f a
Value-Added Tax (referred by Government as the Goods and Services tax) in the second half o f
2009 i s meant to replace 7 existing taxes and significantly reduce the administrative burden o f
complying with taxes for businesses.

 2.21 Sierra Leone reached the HIPC Completion Point in December 2006. Debt relief to
 Sierra Leone under the enhanced HIPC Initiative will amount to US$675.2 million in 2000 net
 present value (NPV) terms,' equivalent to a revised 81.4 percent' NPV reduction o f Sierra
 Leone's debt after traditional debt relief. This assistance i s estimated to correspond to
 approximately US$994 million in nominal terms. In reaching the HIPC completion point, Sierra
`Leone also became eligible for hrther debt relief from the IMF, IDA and the African
 Development Fund under the MDRI. Debt relief provided under MDRI will reduce the debt
 stock by US$556.2 million, in addition to relief received from the three institutions under the
 HIPC Initiative. MDRI debt relief (net o f HIPC assistance) would lead to nominal debt service
 savings o f US$609.9 million on debt owed to IDA, the IMF and the African Development Fund.

2.22 Full delivery o f debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and the MDRI has significantly
reduced Sierra Leone's external public debt. In N P V terms, the stock o f debt would be reduced
fiom US$1,197.6 million at end-2005 to US$483.0 million at end-2006 after HIPC relief and to
U S $ l 10.0 million after MDRI. This assistance i s estimated to correspond to approximately
US$1.6 billion in nominal terms.

2.23 A debt sustainability analysis completed in June 2008 concluded that Sierra Leone's risk
o f debt distress i s moderate. External debt indicators will remain below the HIPC Initiative
thresholds throughout the projection period (see Table 2.3 above), barring unexpected shocks.
Following Enhanced HIPC assistance, as well as additional bilateral and MDRI debt relief at the
Completion Point, the N P V o f debt-to-exports ratio drops to 41 percent in 2007 from 470 percent
in 2005 and subsequently increases to 75 percent by the end o f the projection period. The N P V
o f debt-to-GDP ratio decreased to 9 percent in 2007 from 92 percent in 2005 and then rises over
the medium-term to 29 percent by the end o f the projection period. External debt service ratios
are projected to decline to comfortable levels in line with a significant reduction o f the N P V o f
debt stock after the Completion Point. Sierra Leone's debt sustainability outlook heavily
depends upon sustained export growth and prudent debt management. Stock indicators are
expected to substantially exceed the HIPC thresholds in the event o f large shocks to exports and
a shortfall in grant financing. Thus, the sensitivity analysis underscores the importance o f
pursuing export diversification and prudent borrowing policies in order to avoid potential risks
for debt sustainability.

2.24 The fiscal DSA suggests that Sierra Leone's overall public sector debt dynamics are
sustainable in light o f the current size and the evolution o f the domestic debt stock. Even so, the
gradual increase in external debt indicators over time suggests that additional fiscal adjustment
may be required in the years after 2010. Lower GDP growth would, additionally result in much
less favorable debt dynamics. This underscores the importance o f investing in public
infrastructure projects with a high rate o f return and accelerating structural reforms to set the
stage for private-sector led growth. The development o f a domestic debt market would also help
to gradually reduce the domestic debt stock and extend the maturity o f domestic borrowing. This
would also facilitate the conversion o f non-interest bearing, non-maturing domestic debt into a
longer-term security.

2.25 A new DSA exercise i s ongoing and expected to be completed in November 2009. The
new DSA reflects the impact o f the global economic slowdown in the short-term, slightly more
optimistic growth prospects in the long-run due to the completion o f the Bumbuna Hydropower
Project, the provision o f an additional SDR allocation to reserves, and a lower discount rate.
Preliminary results suggest that Sierra Leone's risk o f debt distress remains moderate under these
assumptions. The analysis also highlights the continued need for prudent macroeconomic and
export-enhancing policies as stress tests suggest that potential threats to sustainability remain.

                             A. THECHALLENGE OF PERVASIVEPOVERTY

3.1      According to the 2008 Sierra Leone Poverty Diagnostic, the poverty headcount i s
estimated to have decreased to 62 percent in 2007 from 67 percent in 2003/04.9 Although the
impact on households o f the food and fuel crisis o f 2008 and the ongoing global recession has
                                                                           N u a
not been measured, it i s likely that poverty has increased. The 2008/09 U H m n Development
Index, based on social indicators from 2007, provides another measure o f poverty. Sierra Leone
was ranked 1SO* out o f 182 countries, almost at the bottom o f the index. L i f e expectancy at birth
i s reported at 47 years. According to the third Multi-Indicator Cluster Survey (2005), infant
mortality in 2005 was estimated at 170 per 1,000 live births, and under-5 mortality at 286 per
l,OOO.'o   According to the same survey, 3 1 percent o f children Iess than 5 years old are
underweight, 40 percent stunted, and 9 percent wasted. The adult literacy rate according to
Human Development Index data i s 38 percent, while the combined gross enrollment rate for
primary, secondary and tertiary education i s estimated at around 45 percent.




   This i s an estimate based on trends in asset ownership in the absence o f any new national survey o f household
   consumption since 2003/04.
10
   According to the UN H m n Development Report (2009), the under-5 mortality rate in 2007 was 279 for mothers
                           u a
   with low education and 164 for mothers with secondary education or higher, for births 10 years before the survey.
   According to preliminary results fiom the 2008 Demographic Health Survey, the average under-5 mortality rate
   was 195 for births 5-9 years before the survey.

                            B. THEPOVERTY       STRATEGY
                                        REDUCTION

3.2     The first PRSP, covering the period 2005 to 2007, was adopted by the government in
February 2005. Since then, a second PRSP covering the period 2008 to 2012 was adopted in
June 2009. It i s entitled "An Agenda for Economic and Social Empowerment." The proposed
operation i s fully consistent with both the first and second PRS. The second PRS i s based on
nationwide consultations, a growth diagnostic analysis, and lessons learnt from implementing the
first PRSP. It maintains the main thrust and areas o f focus o f the first PRS: good governance,
anti-corruption efforts, peace building, macroeconomic stability, private sector development,
natural resource management, and human development. The second PRS, however, presents a
more focused strategy for public investment. Within the general objectives set out above, the
PRSP I1identifies four key priorities as follows:

0   provision o f a reliable power supply in the country;

0   support for agriculture, agri-business, and fisheries with an emphasis on increasing the
    productivity o f the poor;

0   rehabilitation o f the transportation network to facilitate the movement o f goods and people
    and thereby promote economic activity; and

0   improved coverage o f basic social services through decentralization and more support for the
    social protection needs o f the poor and vulnerable.

3.3     To achieve these priorities, the second PRS aims to re-prioritize public expenditures in
favor o f investments in infrastructure and the provision o f agricultural inputs. The Government
aims to make a gradual increase in poverty-related expenditures from 3 percent o f GDP in 2007
to 6 percent o f GDP by 2010, targeting improved access to basic social services (health and
education), and public utilities (water, electricity, and feeder roads).

3.4     The PRS i s also clear that public service reform will be necessary, noting that decades o f
poor governance and socio-economic collapse, exacerbated by the war, have led to a public
service with weak capacity that hinders effective service delivery. Recently the President took
over leadership of the reform process by creating within his office the Public Sector Reform Unit
which will oversee an extended program o f transformation.

3.5     The PRS targets are outlined in a Results Framework that will underpin a comprehensive
monitoring system. The Results Framework will inform annual Performance Contracts between
the Office o f the President and each minister and agency head. These contracts include detailed
in-year targets for quarterly reporting. These targets cascade downwards to the district level,
where most o f the collection and reporting o f information will take place, thus ensuring targets at
all levels are clearly focused on achieving PRSP I1 priorities. Staff from the Strategy and Policy
Unit will represent the Office o f the President at Cluster Working Groups and the National
Technical Committee to ensure that the Office o f the President i s fully up-to-date with the
progress o f PRSP implementation for discussions in the Development Partnership Committee

        and other critical fora. The Strategy and Policy Unit will also manage the quarterly reviews o f
        Performance Management Contracts.

        3.6     The proposed operation would support the PRS with reform measures to: (i)        preserve the
        fiscal space needed for PRS implementation and poverty reduction; (ii)          ensure effective PRS
        implementation by promoting efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use o f public
        resources through enhanced public financial management and governance; and ( i )      i iimprove the
        investment climate by ensuring the provision o f electricity in a fiscally sustainable manner.

                                       TO                      STRATEGY

        4.1    The proposed operation i s fully consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy for
        FY06-09." The CAS i s explicitly rooted in a results-based framework, which l i n k s the overall
        goals o f the government's first PRSP to specific strategic objectives and outcomes which are
        monitored, where appropriate and possible, by quantitative intermediate progress indicators that
        are directly affected by Bank interventions. The CAS includes a series o f programmatic
        development policy operations within the context o f the Framework for Multi-Donor Budget
        Support to support critical PRS policies and reforms and the progressive build-up o f PRS
        implementation capacity.

        4.2    The proposed operation i s also consistent with the objectives set out in the Joint
        Assistance Strategy (JAS) that i s planned to be presented to the Board later in FY10. The JAS,
        under preparation in collaboration with the AfDB and International Finance Corporation, sets out
        the Bank's support to the government's second PRS for the period FY 10-13,

    4.3    The proposed operation was originally envisioned for FY09 as the third in the
    programmatic series o f three established under the CAS. I t i s presented in the first half o f FY10
.   because the second operation (GRGC-2) was delayed from FY08 into FY09 due to policy
    slippages. The proposed operation supports a number o f key outcomes common to both the CAS
    and JAS. These include improved transparency and accountability, more effective public
    resource management including procurement reform, fiscal decentralization, and an improved
    business climate.

                B.       RESULTS ACHIEVED UNDER PREVIOUS DEVELOPMENT
                                                                  POLICY OPERATIONS

    4.4    Progress has been made in each o f the three development policy objectives established for
    the two previous programmatic Governance Reform and Growth operations. The text below
    highlights some o f the key results achieved under those operations. Additional details can be
    found in the description o f the Program (Section 5) in this document and in the documentation
    for GRGG-1 and GRGC-2.

4.5    Preserve the fiscal space needed for poverty reduction. The government has expanded
poverty reducing spending under the HIPC Initiative. Spending on programs and projects
deemed as HIPC priorities increased to 74 percent o f the discretionary budget in 2008 from 62
percent in 2006 and 2007.12

4.6   Promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use of public resources
through enhanced public financial management and governance. Good progress i s being
made in the development o f better tools and procedures across the spectrum o f public financial
management, due in large part to a strong multi-donor program o f support (see Box 4.1).

4.7         Improve the investment climate. Good progress has been made in the agenda for
private sector development. Parliament approved legislation in July 2007 that significantly
reduces the complexity and cost o f business registration (the General Law on Business Start-ups
and the Registration o f Business Act). This should help boost private investment and encourage
f i r m s to j o i n the formal sector. At the same time, it also increased work permit validity to five
years from one year. In support o f the financial sector, the government has adopted the
Companies Act (2009), the Bankruptcy Act (2009), the Payment Systems Act (2008), the
Securities Act (2008), a venture capital scheme, and the Anti-Money Laundering Act (2005).
Most recently, a full Financial Sector Development Plan was adopted in August 2009, based on
the recommendations from the 2006/07 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).

                                 Box 4.1: Progress in Public Financial Management

The Government of Sierra Leone has established a comprehensive program of reforms i public financial
                                                                                          n
management fbded through multi-donor support. I this regard, the World Bank coordinates closely with the
                                                 n
AfDB, DfID, and the EC in providing complementary support for PFM reforms and capacity development. Some of
the more recent key reforms are listed here.

The Constitution of Sierra Leone (1991) was amended in 2008 to grant the Anti-Corruption Commission the power
to prosecute offences involving corruption. A new Integrated Financial Management Information System has been
installed in MOFED and four additional sector ministries. Procurement has been decentralized following the Public
Procurement Act of 2004, with an independent procurement review panel established to arbitrate disputes. Public
service delivery has been progressively devolved following the Local Government Act of 2004. A national
workshop was held in June 2009 on the subject o f decentralization where the President and other officials
emphasized their commitment to deepening the process. The organic budget law was comprehensively updated
through the 2005 Governance and Accountability Act and the associated 2007 Financial Management Regulations.
Public Accounts, which had not been completed or audited for many years, have been brought up-to-date. Public
accounts are now current through 2008 and the audited public accounts for 2006 and 2007 were published on a
government website in June 2009. Initial steps have been taken in preparation for a program of public service
reform. The Establishment Secretary's Office was converted into a more empowered Human Resource Management
Office in 2008 and the Public Service Reform Unit has been placed under the Office of the President to oversee the
start of an extensive program of reform financed by DflD, EC, and UNDP.


4.8      Progress has been made in improving the operations o f public enterprises associated with
infrastructure, although at a slower pace. The privatization o f the Port Authority was initiated in
2008 but progress has been slow. The National Power Authority (NPA) collapsed in 2007 and
the Bank quickly provided financing for the rental o f emergency thermal power. The high cost o f

'' The figure for 2008 falls to 54 percent if f i e 1 for emergency power i s omitted.
                                                             12
thermal power has provided the impetus for a series o f N P A reforms in 2008 and 2009 including
a temporary tariff increase until hydroelectric power becomes available (expected by late 2009 or
early 20 lo), improved tariff collection efficiency, improvements in the distribution network to
reduce line losses, and the hiring o f a financial controller.

4.9     Limited progress has also been made in the mining sector. The government i s
participating in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. A cadastral system to improve
the administration o f mining rights has been piloted in the Kono District in 2005 and i s slowly
being expanded to cover the rest o f the nation. The mining sector laws and regulations were
reviewed in 2007-08 and draft legislation has been proposed (the laws were last revised in 2005).

                        c.   COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER BANKACTIVITIES

4.10 Several operations are direct complements to the Governance Reform and Growth Grant
(GRGG) series and provide financial and technical assistance in these areas.13 The Food Crisis
Response Development Policy Grant (US$3 million equivalent, TF0926 19), financed by the
Food Crisis Response Trust Fund and disbursed in 2008, provided needed fiscal space through
partial compensation for revenues lost due to tariff reductions for imported fuel and food. The
ongoing Institutional Reform and Capacity Building (IRCB) Project (US$25 million equivalent,
Grant H0860-SL) supports capacity building for decentralization with substantial co-financing
from DfID and EC. A Decentralized Service Delivery Project (US$20 million equivalent, Credit
4656-SL) approved in October 2009 will provide additional support. The Integrated Public
Financial Management Reform Project (US$4 million equivalent, Grant 46166-SL), also co-
financed by DfID and EC, provides support to a well established program o f PFM reforms
covering the full spectrum o f activities at the central and local levels o f government including
planning, budget execution, procurement, and external auditing.

4.11 With respect to the investment climate and export promotion, an ongoing Foreign
Investment Advisory Service (FIAS) investment climate activity supports private sector reforms.
This activity i s complemented by three ongoing Bank-financed projects: the Rural and Private
Sector Development Project (US$30 million equivalent, Credit 2900-SL); the Power and Water
Project (US$35 million equivalent, Credit 39450-SL) which provides support for a management
contract for the power utility and for power sector legislative reform; and the Infrastructure
Development Project (US$55 million equivalent, Credit 28950-SL) which supports the
improvement o f the core road network and port operations through the restructuring o f the Sierra
Leone Road Authority and the Sierra Leone Port Authority. A technical assistance project
(US$3.5 million equivalent) in support o f metals and minerals development, notably with regard
to regulatory changes and capacity building, i s planned for Board consideration in early FY 10.




l3   The series was originally defined as three grants. References to the programmatic series will therefore use the
     abbreviation GRGG even though the second and third operations will be credits with the designations GRGC-2
     and GRGC-3.


                                                         13
             D. COMPLEMENTARITY WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT
                                                    PARTNER PROGRAMS

4.12 The proposed GRGG series and GRGC-3 complement and leverage the support o f other
development partners. The specific areas for IDA support have been identified in close
coordination with other development partners, aiming for synergy with their respective
interventions, and building on IDA'S comparative advantage in these areas. The Bank will
continue to collaborate closely with these donors during implementation o f the program
supported by the proposed operation, especially through the multi-donor budget support
framework.

4.13 IMF and IDA staffs have coordinated closely on the identification o f the respective
institutions' areas o f focus. The IMF Board concluded the fourth review o f Sierra Leone's
second arrangement under the PRGF in June 2009. IMF and IDA staffs have collaborated
closely in the past to assist the authorities in the implementation o f the country's PRS,
harmonizing on the design o f structural and policy reforms, and coordinating their advice on
sector economic questions and in identifying solutions for the government. The IMF relies on
IDA for advice and assistance on issues such as private sector development and sector strategies.
The IMF and IDA staffs are also coordinating closely to provide advice to the government in i t s
efforts to address the impact o f the global recession.

,4.14 Budgetary support has been provided to Sierra Leone by the AfDB, DffD, and the EC. As
 o f July 2009, D f f D has already disbursed $10 million into the 2009 budget, and expects to
 disburse an additional amount, up to ;E5 million pounds, later in the year, subject to ministerial
 decision. While no formal agreement has been concluded, a similar amount i s likely for 2010. A
 key focus area o f D f fD support i s the improvement o f governance through strengthened financial
 management systems, public service reform, delivery o f basic services, and decentralization. The
 EC plans to provide 41.5 million for the period 2008-10. Additional financing to compensate
 for the global recession i s being discussed. Public finance management, incorporating the overall
 budget process, regulatory framework, procurement, and financial management, and human
 resource management are key areas o f EC support. The AfDB intends to provide UAlO million
 over the over the period 2009-10 with focus in the areas o f procurement and financial
 management systems. The first tranche o f UA5.5 million was disbursed in July 2009. The Bank
 has collaborated closely with these donors to ensure close alignment and complementarities in
 the areas supported by the GRGC-3. This coordination has been particularly strong on issues o f
 governance, corruption, P F M and capacity building. This i s in recognition o f the damage done to
 the capacity for good governance by years o f corruption before and during the war and the critical
 need to strengthen it.

4.15 As indicated above, the budget support donors, including the Bank, have agreed on a
Framework for Multi-Donor Budget Support (MDBS) backed by a Progress Assessment
Framework (PAF).I4 The PAF i s fully consistent with the new PRS. The PAF sets out clear
goals, benchmarks, monitorable progress indicators, and areas o f responsibility for the




l4A   revised MOU, based on lessons learned, i s under discussion.


                                                          14
 government and for each donor." The prior actions for the proposed operation are a sub-set o f
 the PAF. Progress under the PAF was assessed by joint government and donor missions in June
 2006, May 2007, July 2008, and June 2009 with lessons learned being used to inform the next
 PAF for 2009-10. Each donor maintains own conditions for the release o f funds, although these
 may overlap. l6 This flexibility i s essential to macroeconomic stability and PRS implementation.

 4.16 There are other venues for donor harmonization as well. For example, as mentioned
 above, all four budget support donors have been actively supporting a national program o f reform
 in public sector management from 2004 onward. This program has been deepened under the
 umbrella o f the government's Integrated Public Financial Management Reform Program which
 attracts multi-donor funding, including from a World Bank project o f the same name.

                                          E. LESSONS
                                                  LEARNED

 4.17 The design o f the proposed operation has benefited fkom lessons drawn from guidance
 from Operations Policy and Country Services and fiom the implementation o f GRGC-2 and the
 Food Crisis Response Development Policy Grant. These are summarized below:

      The policy reforms supported by the previous development policy operations in the series,
      including the prior actions, were embedded in the governments own reform agenda and fully
      harmonized with reforms supported by the MDBS donors in the PAF. There was therefore
      strong ownership o f the reforms from the onset. The proposed operation follows a similar
      approach, embedding the reforms in the government's own program and in the PAF.

      The annual MDBS reviews o f the PAF led to a decision to reduce the number o f benchmarks
      used by each donor. This was done in order to better align the PAF with the administrative
      and technical capacity o f the government and, at the same time, increase the focus on the
      remaining benchmarks. As a result, the number o f prior actions in the proposed operation
      amounts to 5 compared to 9 used in the previous operation in the series. Similarly, the
      selection o f the triggers for the next operation reflects a balance between criticality, capacity,
      and evolving program scope.

      The effectiveness o f Bank supported policies and institutional reforms can be enhanced by
      the complementarities with other Bank operations and the efforts o f other donors in the
      reform areas. In particular, harmonization allows each donor to focus on particular reform
      areas as other donors take the lead in other reform areas. The design o f the proposed
      operation reflects this lesson in choice o f prior actions and areas o f focus.




~~       ~               ~~




  The number o f binding donor benchmarks has been reduced fiom 42 in 2006 to 29 for 2007,27 in 2008, and 14 in
 l5
  2009.
l6 DfID and the EC now share the same health and education benchmarks. They intend to use fully shared
  benchmarks for all 2009 actions and outcomes to be measured in 2010.

                                  F. ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS

4.18 The design o f the proposed operation i s based on the conclusions and recommendations
presented in a number o f analytical documents. They include core diagnostic assessments by the
World Bank in collaboration with the government and other donors. The design aspects related
to the protection o f fiscal space for poverty reduction, and for the quality o f budget execution, are
informed primarily by the 2004 Public Expenditure Review (PER), which first identified the
need to protect poverty reducing programs in the context o f uncertain revenues and grants, and
the ongoing 2009 PER whph reconfirms the need to improve the quality o f budget execution in
order to better protect poverty reducing programs.

4.19 The design aspects related to the promotion o f efficiency, transparency and accountability
in the use o f public resources are based on the findings in a wide range o f analytical products.
Among the most influential are: the background papers and documentation for the IRCB project,
that review out the details o f the government's full PFM reform program; the 2007 Public
Expenditure and Financial Accountability Progress Report that highlights key areas in need o f
more reforms; and the 2007 procurement audit that highlights the need for continued progress.
The ongoing 2009 PER also informed the design through an updated analysis o f P F M progress
and challenges, including a focus on procurement reform.

4.20 Finally, the program content related to the power sector i s informed by the Bank's sector
policy dialogue with the authorities and by the 2008 Poverty Diagnostic. The background papers
and documentation for the Power and Water project established the need for urgent financial
reforms in the National Power Authority (NPA). The background papers for the Bank's support
to the government's procurement o f emergency power helped to identify the substantial fiscal
cost to government that emergency power would require, thus reinforcing the need for financial
reforms within the NPA. The 2008 Poverty Diagnostic established that one o f the reform
options, a higher electricity tariff, would not adversely affect vulnerable groups. In particular, the
proposed increase in the electricity tariff could be pro-poor if it results in the release o f resources
that could be better targeted to the poor through other poverty reducing program^.'^ There are
two reasons for this. First, the poor have very little access to electricity: most live in rural areas
outside Freetown. Second, the current budgetary allocation for fuel for emergency power was the
single largest item in the 2008 budget largely because the tariff in place at the start o f the year
was insufficient to cover operating costs. This denied resources to other, better targeted, poverty
reducing programs.




"This analysis omits positive, second round effects of electricity provision. An example would be business
  investments in new capacity, thus spurring job creation. Another example would be better health care made
  possible by hospitals able to refrigerate medicines, provide x-ray diagnosis, and conduct surgery.

                               5. THE PROPOSED OPERATION

                                      A. RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES

5.1    The proposed credit o f SDR 6.4 million (US$10 million equivalent) i s the third in a
programmatic series o f three development policy operations. In a period when the economy i s
under stress from the global recession, the measures supported by the proposed operation would
contribute to:

   preserve the fiscal space needed for poverty reduction by protecting poverty reducing
   spending priorities;
   promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use o f public resources by
   strengthening the link between resource allocation and the objectives o f growth and poverty
   reduction, pursuing procurement reforms, strengthening the institutional set-up for public
   sector reform and strengthening the implementation o f decentralization; and
    improve the investment climate by ensuring the provision o f electricity in a fiscally'
    sustainable manner.

                                               B. POLICYAREAS

5.2     Policy actions supported by the proposed operation are part o f the government program as
defined in the PRSP I1 and reflected in the Letter o f Development Policy (LDP) (Annex 2).
Table 5.2 provides details o f the operation's prior actions. The rationale for their selection i s
discussed below, particularly in terms o f their importance to the program, expressed government
commitment and feasibility. Specifically, each o f the three policy areas in this sub-section
includes a description o f the situation and challenges facing the government, a review o f recent
government actions, and reforms planned to be undertaken under the program. Each policy area
concludes with a sub-section that outlines the policy actions supported by the proposed
operation. The operation foresees outcomes in line with the results targeted in the CAS and JAS
which, in turn, contribute to the results sought by the PRS.

                    1. Preserve the Fiscal Space Needed for Poverty Reduction

5.3     Current situation and challenges. The government has made significant progress in
expanding poverty reducing spending under the HIPC 1nitiative.l8 Spending on programs and
projects deemed as HIPC priorities increased from 32 percent o f the discretionary budget in 2001




 The l i s t o f expenditure programs that are deemed to be poverty reducing was agreed in 2002 as part o f the HIPC
 Decision Point discussions. The list includes the domestic contributions to programs for the ministries responsible
 for agriculture, mineral resources, marine resources, youth and sports, education, and health. It also includes some
 aspects o f security, reflecting Sierra Leone's post-conflict status. Only a few changes have been made to this l i s t
 since 2002, most notably the addition o f transfers to local councils following the re-establishment o f local
 government in 2004. Wages are excluded. Annex 5 contains the l i s t approved for 2008.


                                                          17
to 62 percent and 74 percent in 2007 and 2008, respe~tively'~ the first row o f Table 5.1
                                                           (See
below).

5.4      The data in the remaining rows o f Table 5.1 suggest, however, that government capacity
to fund pro-poor spending and protect expenditure targets needs strengthening. Pro-poor
spending f e l l short o f budget targets in all years except 2003 (See the third row o f Table 5.1).
The degree o f under-spending was especially noteworthy in 2007. The governments' efforts to
protect poverty reducing programs in that year were constrained by an excessive use o f the
budget head for miscellaneous expenditures (head 501) in the first quarter and the near absence
o f external budget support in the remaining three quarters.

5.5     In general, the authorities have found it difficult to maintain spending targets for
individual ministries.20Most notably, spending on health was significantly below allocations in
2004, 2005, 2007, and 2008. The average absolute deviation between planned and actual
spending for the 20 largest budget heads, expressed as a percentage o f the budgeted amounts, has
fluctuated between 11 percent (in 2006) and 23 percent (in 2007). (See fifth row o f data in Table
5.1 .) Only some o f this variance i s the result o f shocks to resource availability and debt service
obligations. Variances remain high even after these shocks are filtered out. (See the bottom row
o f Table 5.1 .) Much o f the under-spending on poverty reduction can be traced to over-spending
on other budget heads, particularly miscellaneous budget head 501. Additional competition for
resources could emerge in the form o f new debt obligations arising from the regularization o f
selected contingent liabilities21 or from higher domestic interest obligations following the
continued conversion o f non-interest bearing securities held by the BSL to interest bearing paper.

   Report.
21 The draft 2009 PER fmds that inadequate management o f contingent liabilities i s creating risks to the fiscal space
   available for government programs including those aimed at poverty reduction.

5.6      I t should be noted that the fiscal space available for poverty reducing programs could be
increased through a stronger revenue effort. The revenue effort in Sierra Leone (1 1.4 percent o f
GDP in 2008) is rather l o w relative to other l o w income countries. The regional average is
approximately 15 percent. According a recent report, part o f the problem can be traced to
discretionary tax exemptions.22 As much as one-third o f all collectable revenues may be
foregone due to exemptions, only some o f which are mandated by law or treaty.

5.7     Recent government actions. Under both the first and second PRGF arrangements, to
help protect priority expenditures, the government agreed to allow limited additional domestic
borrowing in the event that external budget support falls below programmed levels. The
government replaced the old Financial Management Information System with a new Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) in the AGD in 2005. The IFMIS has been
installed in seven key M D A s responsible for education, health, agriculture, public works,
external audit, policing, defense, and the prisons. The IFMIS i s facilitating better expenditure
control and accounting. The government has also begun preparing commitment control and
expenditure management procedures for conformity with the new Government Budgeting and
Accountability Act (2005) and in line with the requirements o f the new IFMIS. Less complex
accounting software that uses the same 27 digits charts o f account coding structure utilized by the
IFMIS has been introduced to the Local Councils. A s o f mid-2009, the software has been rolled
out to 8 local councils. In 2006, the government adopted the first written procedures for budget
execution, including the protection o f poverty reducing expenditure programs. These procedures
rely o n better coordination between cash f l o w forecasting, procurement planning and expenditure
control.23 Implementation o f these procedures, which was to have started in January 2007, has
been delayed due to the decision to implement cash budgeting in that year due to shortfalls in
external support. Even so, as Table 5.1 shows, the government did improve the ratio of actual to
planned spending on poverty reducing priorities in 2008 to 95 percent. The government has also
reached an agreement with the BSL to spread out the conversion o f non-interest securities over
time in a manner that will not create an unacceptable reduction in fiscal space for poverty
reducing programs. The first tranche o f conversions took place in late 2006. As noted below,
this schedule has been revised in light o f recent fiscal developments.

5.8     Actions under Program. In the short-run, if revenues or external financing fall short o f
budget targets, the authorities intend to reduce spending for poverty reducing programs relatively
less than other discretionary spending. Going forward, the government intends to preserve the
fiscal space for poverty reduction by increasing revenues, improving aid predictability, reducing
aid volatility and protecting priority expenditures. As detailed above, in the medium-term the
government i s actively pursuing a higher revenue effort. Reforms underway, and notably the
introduction o f the Goods and Service Tax and a reduction in discretionary tax exemptions, will
help improve the revenue effort gradually to 13.2 percent o f GDP by 20 12. In order to increase
aid predictability, the government has engaged the MDBS donors in dialogue, seeking a gradual
transition to year N+l decision making where disbursement decisions are made prior to the
budget cycle for each successive year. This will allow the government to know exactly what it
can expect in each year. At a minimum, knowing that the transition to T+l will take time to

achieve, the authorities seek disbursements in the first quarter o f each financial year. In order to
reduce volatility, the government agreed with the IMF in 2008 to reduce the exposure to aid
volatility by reverting to its earlier practice o f discounting the performance tranches o f the budget
support donors by 50 percent.

5.9     A number o f actions will be taken to reduce over-spending on programs outside the list o f
poverty reducing priorities. The risk o f contingent liabilities will be reduced through new
legislation to regulate debt management. The IFMIS will be employed in ways meant to
strengthen commitment and expenditure controls. The government will take measures to reduce
the need for Miscellaneous Budget Head 501, in light o f the repeated over-use seen in previous
years. This will be achieved in part by ensuring more adequate allocations to key ministries. The
government will strengthen the integration o f procurement planning in the budget process in
order to better synchronize sectoral plans with annual budget allocations. Finally, from 2010
onward, additional resources will be freed up as hydroelectric power from the BHP allows the
government to end i t s transfer to NPA for fuel.

5.10 The Bank and some-donors are also exploring the possibility o f protecting basic service
delivery, a responsibility now largely transferred to the local governments, by channeling funds
to local councils. The Bank's contribution would come via the Decentralized Service Delivery
Project.

5.1 1 Focus o Proposed Operation. The proposed GRGC-3 supports one policy action that is
                f
critical to the objective o f preserving the fiscal space available for poverty reduction: the
variance in expenditure composition in 2008 for the 20 largest budget heads will not exceed the
overall deviation in domestic primary expenditures by more than 10 percentage points.24

     2. Promote Efficiency, Transparency and Accountability in the Use o f Public Resources

5.12 Significant progress has been made in re-building various institutions responsible for
governing the state and safeguarding national security. Even so, there continues to be a need for
deeper reforms and strengthening capacity for effective and efficient delivery o f basic services
and long-term sustainable development. The government is committed to advancing governance
reforms. Those supported by the proposed credit focus o n budget execution, procurement
reform, public service reform, and decentralization. As mentioned above, the full program o f
PFM reforms i s supported through the multi-donor IPFMRP as well as additional donor
benchmarks in the M D B S PAF.

         a. Procurement Reform

5.13 Current situation and challenges. Between April 2003 and January 2004, only 10
percent o f the contract awards were made on the basis o f an open tender process.25 To correct
this situation, interim rules and regulations were approved by the Cabinet in June 2004 and new

  spending on poverty reducing priorities over the period 2001 to 2008.

legislation was signed into law in December 2004. As a result, a new National Public
Procurement Authority (NPPA) i s responsible for procurement reform under the oversight o f the
MOFED. NPPA began hiring core staff in mid-2006 and published new procurement regulations
in September 2006 consistent with the 2004 Procurement Act. Under the Act, all Ministries,
Departments and Agencies (MDAs) are to have procurement units and committees. The law also
requires acceptable procurement plans from each public entity before expenditures can be
approved. This new practice will help reduce waste and fraud and it will also help inform the
budget process.

5.14 Recent government action. The first procurement plans were completed at the start o f the
2006 budget year by nine key ministries and agencies.26 Training has been provided in each o f
the years 2004 through 2008. To promote transpaiency and accountability, the law also requires
NPPA to issue a quarterly bulletin with information about ministry procurement plans,
invitations to bid, contract awards and a sufvey o f unit prices. Some progress has been made in
this regard with the creation o f a website that contains much o f the mandated information, albeit
with a substantial lag. Amendments to the Financial Management Regulations aimed at closing
key loopholes in procurement and expenditure commitment were submitted to Parliament in
October 2007.

5.15 The initial reform results have been positive for the nine M D A s with procurement plans
although additional progress i s needed: 34 percent o f the 2006 contracts above the small
purchase threshold were awarded through competitive proce~ses.~' By 2008, the number o f
M D A s with approved procurement plans had increased to 23, and 43 by 2009. Based on initial
findings from the 23 entities with approved procurement plans, 120 tenders were conducted by
open competition out o f 173 above the small purchase threshold (69 percent). The value of the
competitive tenders was 95 percent o f the total value above the national threshold. While these
gains are impressive, there i s s t i l l room for improvement: only 20 percent o f all transactions in
2008 (regardless o f threshold) from the 23 entities with approved procurement plans were
competitive.

5.16 N e w challenges are emerging as well. While many mid-level and senior government staff
      I




have been trained to serve as procurement officers, it i s becoming clear that this i s not sufficient
to produce good results because many o f these officers are quickly transferred to other jobs. The
NPPA is examining various solutions including the creation o f an independent cadre o f
procurement officers. In addition, under the Public Procurement A c t (2004), the Procurement
Committees are mandated to "review and approve evaluation reports and contract award
recommendations." Yet, some ministries have allegedly attempted to overrule the
recommendations o f their Procurement Committees. The NPPA and the authorities are exploring
means o f rectifying this situation.

5.17 Actions under the Program. The government has ensured that the National Public
Procurement Authority, its Secretariat, the Independent Review Panel and the MDA procurement

26
   These are the ministries responsible for agriculture, defence, education, health, mineral resources, police, road
   maintenance, transport and works.
27 The share increases to 39 percent if one uses contract value rather than the number o f contracts.

units are adequately staffed and operational. The government i s committed to honoring the
transparency requirements o f the Public Procurement Act by (i)       issuing quarterly Procurement
Bulletins on a timely basis; (ii)
                                publishing approved procurement plans, notices o f invitations to
bid, contracts awarded and unit prices for contracts; and ( i )  i i posting this information o n an
N P P A website for wide dissemination.28 Procurement u n i t s and tender committees will continue
to receive training from NPPA and other sources.

           b. Public Service Reform

5.18 Current situation and challenges. The government views public service reform as a
means o f strengthening its capacity for the effective PRS implementation and monitoring. The
PRSP asserts that "weak capacity in public sector institutions will be a major challenge to the
implementation, monitoring and evaluation o f the PRSP II."29       At present, the government is
burdened with a highly compressed public service with very few technical staff. Professional and
technical staff in grades 5 through 10 made up only 20 percent o f the total in November 2005,
compared to an international average o f 60 percents3' There i s a general lack o f information
about the size and composition o f the public service relative to the needs o f the government in
the context o f the PRS and the decentralization process. Record keeping has also been poor.
This makes it difficult to take strategic decisions at the Cabinet level o n the trade-offs between
personnel and other expenditures.

5.19 Recent government action. Action undertaken by the government since the end o f the
conflict has been episodic and to a considerable extent is concerned with remuneration rather
than strategic staffing decisions. Some preparatory work has been completed for capacity
building and organization development within specific ministries and the payroll cleansing has
been carried out. This work was largely overseen by the Governance Reform Secretariat during
2002 - 08, and thereafter by its successor, the Public Sector Reform Unit.31

0     A review o f public service grading and pay structure was conducted in 2004,32and later a
      study was conducted related to a minimum wage and senior executive scheme.33 In January
      2007, the Cabinet approved a Public Sector Policy Framework which is to be developed into a
      National Policy. A Compensation Committee was also established. Subsequent consultancy
      work was done in M a y 2008 on a pay and grading structure but definitive action is yet to
      follow.
      Fourteen management and functional reviews were completed up to 2008. Implementation o f
      recommendations has been slow and the Public Sector Reform Unit has introduced a priority
      implementation strategy to hasten the process.

     The Human Resource Management Office was officially launched by the President in August
     2008 in succession to the Establishment Secretary's Office. Its role has broadened to deal
     with the constituent elements o f Human Resource Management for the C i v i l Service, the
     intention being that the Public Service Commission will be increasingly focused on strategic
     and regulatory matters and overseeing the propriety o f the system.
     Between July and December 2008 as a feature o f the Records Management Improvement
     Program, a payroll verification exercise for the C i v i l Service was carried out. Up to 10
     percent o f named personnel were found to be improperly entered while a further 1,000+ are
     soon due, or overdue, for retirement.

5.20 Actions under the Program. The PRSP commits the government to a medium-term
program o f civil service reform and capacity building. Some o f the building blocks o f the
strategy have already been put in place (see above). Full-fledged reform will take time and a
concentration o f resources and effort. The coming program i s directly supported by the E C and
DflD, with UNDP funding the so-called "emergency" start-up activities from August 2009.
World Bank support will continue in the complementary areas o f public sector financial
management reform and an increased focus on service delivery through devolved provision. A
number o f important activities planned by the government to advance the overall process o f
reform are listed below:

     Align organizational structures with the strategy including a new framework for the
     integration o f all reforms.
     Assign standard setting for decentralized service delivery to M D A s while devolving oversight
     o f decentralized public servants to the local governments.
     Build capacity o f the civil service to ensure a sufficient base o f skills and address issues o f
     retention and sustainability. In addition, a new Policy and Strategy for C i v i l Service Training
     and Development and an action plan to promote the recruitment and retention o f needed
     professional and technical staff in grades 5 through 10 will be submitted to the Cabinet for
     adoption.
     Establish new HRM policies and procedures to attract, motivate, and retain staff (including in
     remote areas) by replacing discretion with rules that are efficient, transparent and fair.34
     Appoint human resource specialists to key ministries to help manage staff training and
     development. Also, the percentage o f personnel files containing complete records, with initial
     priority on the health sector, will be improved a n n ~ a l l y . ~ '
     Establish better integration o f manpower policies into the national budget process.36 The
     annual budget call circular will provide M D A s with guidance o n HR policy while annual
     formal manpower hearings (piloted in key ministries in 2006) will be established as part o f the
     budget process. This was partially achieved for the 2007 budget.
     Focus on cross-cutting issues to be enhanced (gender, anti-comption, attitudinal change).

34
   A Civil Service Code was drafted and reviewed over the period 2003-04 but it has not been formally adopted due
   to a number o f issues including those related to grading, pay and promotions.
35 Complete records require documents sufficient to establish and validate the authenticity o f the status o f a civil
   servant: appointment letter, birth certificate, current grading authority and pay authority.
36 The need to do so was flagged in the 2002 Country Financial Accountability Assessment and reconfirmed by the
   2004 PER.

0     The government intends to prepare a public service law that will provide the broader legal
      framework for public service management and supporting institutions.

           c. Decentralization

5.21 Current situation and challenges. The government believes that a contributing factor to
the ten-year civil war was the disaffection o f a large section o f the rural population. These
people were effectively cut-off from political representation by the elimination o f local
government in 1972 and cut-off from Freetown and the rest o f the world by the lack o f a
functioning road infrastructure, social services and economic opportunities. Household survey
data for 2003/04 shows that the problem persists with large inequalities between urban Freetown
and the rest o f the country. For example, the incidence o f poverty in Freetown in that period was
only 22 percent compared to 79 percent in the rural areas.37 Similarly, a 2004 pilot Core Welfare
Indicators Questionnaire showed that 91 percent o f the urban population had access to safe water
while only 45 percent o f the rural population had such access.

5.22 Recent government action. The government has therefore embarked on a restoration o f
local government and the devolution o f public service provision. As noted in the PRSP, this
decision should open up space for political participation and inclusiveness in public decision-
making processes. The government took the first steps in 2004 with the passage o f the Local
Government Act that created new Local Councils (LCs) and mandated regular elections at the
local           The secondary legislation (statutory instrument) also set out a schedule for the
phased devolution o f services between 2004 and 2008. The first local elections in more than 30
years were successfully completed in May 2004 followed by a new round in 2007. As o f 2009,
37 out o f 80 designated MDA functions have been fully devolved, by way o f legal
pronouncements, to the Councils and a good number more have `de facto' become their
responsibility. In addition, the government, through the World Bank financed Institutional
Reform and Capacity Building Project, provided intensive training, technical assistance and
investment to tailor central systems for decentralization and to help LCs build basic management
capacity and a transparent and accountable governance culture.

5.23 In the context o f the decentralization agenda, the following progress has been made
towards establishing a functioning local government system and improving inclusiveness,
transparency and accountability o f public resource management:

       With a view to building visibility and legitimacy o f LCs in the eyes o f residents, an early
       Rapid Results Initiative was introduced. The Rapid Results Initiative (with transfers
       averaging at US$30,000) provided for diverse investments such as road and bridge
       rehabilitation, small water systems and the construction o f markets and toilets and sanitary
       slaughterhouses. This approach patterned the application o f the Local Government
       Development Grant facility in successive years.

   An intergovernmental grants system with solid foundations i s in place, emphasizing vertical
   and horizontal equity. It i s transparent, i t s distribution formulae are subject to annual review
   and it i s administered with full accountability through government procedures.
   Approximately one fifth o f the vertical transfer i s made up o f Local Government
   Development Grants which Councils can use in discretionary manner in line with their
   development plans. Recurrent grants remain tied to specific sectors and have been subject to
   unpredictability o f total annual transfer.
   Devolution has been most marked in terms o f health functions with strong adherence to the
   legislative schedule. Education and agriculture have also shown good progress but were
   behind schedule.
   Core management staff (8 in number) are now recruited directly by LCs and are managed
   under the oversight o f a statutory body established under the 2004 Act - the Local
   Government Services Commission.
   Through participatory planning and implementation, all LCs have identified local
   development priorities and prepared three-year rolling development plans.
   An intensive training, workplace mentoring and equipping program has built critical capacity
   at LCs for both officers and elected officials. The most recent (2008) regularized performance
   assessment for LCs recorded particular progress as regards regularity o f council meetings
   and minute taking; citizen participation in council business; planning; procurement;
   reconciliation o f accounts and bank statements and disclosure o f financial information.

5.24 Actions under the Program. The government intends to further deepen the
decentralization process through continued devolution o f functions, transparent and accountable
management o f resources and the elimination o f inconsistencies between various pieces o f
government legislation. The government agenda i s ambitious:

   A National Policy on Devolution will be elaborated for Cabinet approval based on the series
   o f national and regional consultations held in 2008.
   Inconsistencies between the Local Government Act (LGA) (2004) and existing laws will be
   resolved, particularly for those affecting education, health sectors and feeder road
   maintenance.
   A Chiefdom Governance Policy will be put in place and the Act amended correspondingly.
   Options to improve the predictability and timeliness o f grant transfers will be explored by
   MoFED and other stakeholders. Streamlining measures to incorporate in a "second
   generation" transfer system will be considered.
   Greater effort will be applied to increasing Local Government's own revenue resources.
   A switch will be made to more demand-led approaches to capacity building, both for the LCs
   and the MDAs, for their policy and oversight roles.
   Support will be provided to development o f the national policy on HR Management, in
   particular the management o f staff at local level, retention and motivation o f staff, and career
   mobility.

5.25 This agenda will be supported through the IRCB Project through early 2011 (EU and
DBD funded and World Bank managed) and the World Bank financed Decentralized Service
Delivery Program.


                                                25
5.26 Focus o Proposed Operation. The proposed GRGC-3 would support three policy
                f
reforms (prior actions) judged to be critical to the promotion o f efficiency, transparency and
accountability in the use o f public expenditure^.^' The first i s the production by at least 29
ministries, departments, or agencies (MDAs) o f 2009 procurement plans for the approval by
MOFED or other appropriate statutory bodies. Also, for at least 23 entities with approved 2008
procurement plans, the share o f total procurement that was conducted through open competition
should be at least 30 percent o f the total o f procurements above the national small purchase
threshold, whether the share is defined in terms o f number o f procurements or value o f
procurements. The second requires that the Human Resource Management Office has
demonstrably discharged its responsibilities for the recruitment, promotion, and retirement o f
civil service staff in grades 1 - 5 between September 2008 and September 2009. The third
focuses on facilitating public service delivery in the previously under-served districts through
decentralization. This objective is supported by confirming that the budgetary funds actually
transferred to local councils in the first three quarters o f 2008, expressed as a share o f total
discretionary non-salary, non-interest recurrent spending, will not deviate by more than 3
percentage points from the budgeted share.

                                    3. Improve the Investment Climate

                                                                            1
 5.27 Current situation and challenges. As indicated in the PRSP 1 , one o f the most critical
constraints to the investment climate in Sierra Leone i s access to electric power.40 Yet, less than
 10 percent o f Sierra Leone's total population has access to electricity, compared to 49 percent in
 Ghana and 46 percent in Nigeria. The production o f power by the National Power Authority
(NPA) collapsed in 2007 following several years o f declining output. In 2005, NPA auditors
concluded that continued operations were not sustainable in the face o f accumulated losses and a
weak cash-flow. It is striking in this regard that Sierra Leoneans pay some o f the highest tariff
rates per kilowatt-hour in the region and yet, until recently, the revenue collected was not
sufficient to cover costs o f US$0.37 per kilowatt-hour.41 The problem can be traced to several
sources: inadequate maintenance, technical line losses, under-investment, vandalism, a bloated
workforce, a tariff structure that does not automatically adjust for changes in fuel costs, and
inefficient revenue collection. In the medium-term, the challenge will be to expand the capacity
to generate and distribute enough power to supply a growing nation. In this context, the PRSP I1
proposes that public-private partnerships may provide a viable way to meet this growing need
despite limited public resources. The underlying legal framework to facilitate this approach in a
manner that both attracts investors and protects the government for electric power as well as
other infrastructure is, however, presently lacking. The PRSP I1 also identifies a key role for
public investments in support o f private sector growth, including investments in roads, water, and
electricity. The ongoing 2009 PER exercise has, however, identified weaknesses in the public
investment framework that will need to be addressed to ensure that only the most viable and
pressing public projects are selected into the public investment portfolio.

 5.28 The investment climate i s also affected by policies related to trade, finance, public
enterprises, and specific sectors such as mining. The small domestic market within Sierra Leone
cannot, by itself, generate enough demand for sustained high rates o f growth: sales in overseas
markets are an essential element o f the national growth strategy. Sierra Leone has a moderately
diverse export base consisting o f unprocessed diamonds, iron ore, bauxite, rutile, fish, palm oil,
coffee, cocoa and tourism. Investments in the mining sector have been and are being made but
more needs to be done in support o f cash crops, fisheries, and tourism. There i s strong anecdotal
evidence that new business investments and j o b creation are constrained by limited access to
credit and thin capital markets. High and risk free Treasury bill rates, combined with weak
property rights and inadequate collateral, tend to reduce the incentive for the commercial banking
system to lend to the private sector. The poor management o f several key public enterprises has
also been a significant drag on economic growth and j o b creation. In addition to electricity,
among these enterprises are the utilities contrQlling water supplies, road maintenance, port
services, and non-cellular telecommunications. Sierra Leone remains highly dependent upon the
mining sector for export receipts, the bulk o f which has come from diamonds since the end o f the
war. The main challenges facing government include h o w to induce the expansion o f existing
mining operations, further diversify mineral production, obtain better fiscal terms with more
transparency and bring more o f the benefits (and less o f the costs) from the extractive industries
to the miners, their communities and the country. Another unresolved issue is h o w much mining
activity takes place outside the formal system and h o w to bring this activity within the system.

5.29 Recent government action. In response to the collapse o f output from NPA, the new
government contracted in late 2007 an independent emergency power provider selected through
international competitive bidding. The World Bank financed the rental cost o f 1 5 M W from the
emergency power provider in 2008. This cost was the largest expenditure item ,in the 2008
budget. The government paid for both the rental costs and fuel consumption in the first half o f
2009 while the UN Peace Building Fund helped pay these costs in the third quarter o f 2009. This
arrangement is meant to be temporary, until l o w cost power is available from the Bumbuna
Hydroelectric Project expected for late 2009. The N P A is investing in pre-paid meters to
improve the efficiency o f revenue collection. Collection losses were reduced to 20 percent o f
sales by March 2009 from an average o f 40 percent in 2008. An additional contract with an
independent power producer was recently cancelled by mutual agreement with the provider.
While this has sharply reduced government obligations, substantial close-out payments are
required in the second h a l f o f 2009 and the first half o f 2010.

5.30 Good progress has been made on the agenda for private sector development. Parliament
approved legislation in'July 2007 that significantly reduces the complexity and cost o f business
registration (the General L a w o n Business Start-ups and the Registration o f Business Act). The
government also increased work permit validity from one year to five years. These changes
should help boost private investment and encourage some firms to j o i n the formal sector. It is
also worth noting that Sierra Leone's ranking in the Doing Business Indicators, even if low, has
been consistently improving from 168/175 in the 2007 edition to 148/183 in the 2010 edition. In
support o f the financial sector, the Parliament adopted the Companies Act (2009) which
modernizes i t s predecessor, the Bankruptcy Act (2009), the Payment Systems Act (2008), the




                                                27
Securities Act (2008), a venture capital scheme, and the Anti-Money Laundering Act (2005).42
Most recently, a full Financial Sector Development Plan was adopted in August 2009, based on
the recommendations from the 2006/07 FSAP. The plan addresses four main areas o f the
financial system: the commercial banking system, access to finance, strengthening contractual
and long-term savings, and strengthening the enabling environment. Progress has also been
made in improving the operations o f public enterprises associated with infrastructure, with the
privatization o f the Port Authority initiated in 2008. The government i s participating in the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. A cadastral system to improve the administration
o f mining rights has been piloted in the Kono District in 2005 and i s slowly being expanded to
cover the full nation. The mining sector laws and regulations were reviewed in 2007-08 and
draft legislation has been proposed by the Law Reform Commission and submitted to the Cabinet
for review.

5.3 1 Actions under Program. The government plans to undertake reforms that will strengthen
the financial viability and sustainability o f NPA, with the short-run aim o f ensuring that N P A can
purchase fuel for i t s generators and purchase electricity from the Bumbuna Hydroelectric Project.
These reforms involve a combination o f reduced operational costs, adjustments in the tariff to
better reflect changing production costs (both upwards and downwards), and continued efforts to
improve billing efficiency.43 The government expects to be able to gradually reduce the
electricity tariff when low cost power generated by BHP becomes available. The authorities in
the National Power Authority will be supported in these efforts by two financial advisors. The
government also intends to adopt a medium-term power sector strategy based a restructuring o f
NPA, public and private investments, regional integration, and supporting policy reforms.

5.32     The government intends to undertake a number o f additional actions in support o f the
investment climate. While the dialogue i s ongoing, a fairly broad agenda i s being pursued.
Some selected actions are highlighted here. Efforts are underway to make it easier to do business
while complying with government requirements: tax compliance procedures are being simplified
while procedures for licenses and fees required for work permits, business start-ups and new
construction projects are to be published on the internet. Property rights are to be strengthened
through the introduction o f a cadastre-based commercial land titling strategy, starting with the
Western Area. The government also plans to submit to Parliament a Law on the Commercial
U s e o f Land. The government will work with the ECOWAS Secretariat to improve the
implementation o f the ECOWAS free trade agreement. With the assistance o f DflD, FIAS and
MIGA, the government intends to assist the Sierra Leone Export Development and Investment
Corporation (recently restructured and renamed as the Sierra Leone Export Investment Promotion
                                                The
Agency) to operate more e f f i ~ i e n t l y . ~ ~ government will begin implementing the Financial
Sector Development Plan, introduce regulatory changes in support o f the Anti-Money
Laundering Act, and further strengthen the capacity o f the BSL to play i t s role in banking
supervision as well as monitoring implementation o f the Anti-Money Laundering Act.


42 Work to Wher strengthen the act i s underway.
43
    The authorities also committed to the development o f a comprehensive tariff policy that was to have been
   developed by December 2008 in fulfillment o f a structural benchmark under the IMF PRGF. This was delayed as
   the key supporting studies were not completed on time.
44 DfID and FIAS are providing support to this effort.




                                                     28
Government intends to continue i t s reform programs related to water supply, road maintenance,
and port services. In the mining sector, the government will continue to deepen its participation
in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, gradually expand the cadastral system to the
entire nation, and modernize the fiscal regime.

5.33 Focus o Proposed Operation. In order to improve the investment climate by ensuring
                f
the provision o f electricity in a fiscally sustainable manner, the proposed operation would support
the following critical prior action in the power sector: N P A revenue collection will be improved
by implementing a tariff increase in the second half o f 2008.45 As indicated above, however, the
imminent arrival o f l o w cost hydroelectric power will allow a substantially lower tariff in the
near future. This is addressed in the choice o f triggers for the next development policy operation
(see Section 5.D below). Substantial complementary support for this and other efforts in the
power sector i s being provided by the AfDB, BADEA, DfID, EU, the Government o f Italy, and
JICA. While the proposed operation does not cover other investment climate areas,
complementary support for actions related to the investment climate i s being provided by DfID
and the World Bank Group through other instruments; support for trade reforms i s provided by
the European Union and the Commonwealth Fund for Technical Cooperation; support for
financial sector reforms i s provided by the IMF, German Development Cooperation, and the
World Bank; and support for the mining sector is to be provided by the World Bank and UNDP.

                               C. PRIOR ACTIONSFOR THE PROPOSED GRGC-3

5.34 The proposed GRGC-3 would support selected reforms in the government's program
described in Section 5.B and in i t s Letter o f Development Policy (LDP) in Annex 2 that are
deemed essential to i t s successful implementation. The rationale for their selection has been
discussed in the previous section, namely their importance to the program and expressed
government commitment and feasibility. This list is consistent with the thrust o f the triggers
defined at the end o f the preparation o f GRGG-1 and is aligned with `the government's overall
PRS program and included in the joint performance matrix o f the multi-donor budget support
group (Annex 4). Compliance with these prior actions as defined in the Financial Agreement
forms the basis for IDA to proceed with the proposed operation. Table 5.2 presents an overview
o f the prior actions and their status o f implementation as formulated in collaboration with the
government.

5.35 The prior actions for the proposed GRGC-3 are derived from triggers that were identified
during the preparation o f GRGC-2. Two triggers were not met as originally specified but rather
met as revised, one for local council transfers, and one for the protection o f poverty reducing
programs. The fourth quarter 2008 transfers to local councils could not be met due to substantial
shortfalls in donor aid and over-spending in budget head 501. Consequently, the same wording
adopted for the GRGC-2 prior action based on 2007 outcomes i s applied to 2008 outcomes,
confining the prior action to the first three quarters o f the year. The list o f poverty reducing
programs includes local council transfers with the consequence that a substantial shortfall in


45   The 2008 Poverty Note indicates that electricity subsidies are among the least w e l l targeted subsidies that the
     government can implement, since only about 10 percent o f the subsidies reach the poor.

transfers would also induce a shortfall in spending on poverty reducing programs. Thus, this
trigger was replaced by an alternative prior action drawn from the MDBS PAF that focuses on
variances in expenditure composition in the 20 largest budget heads in excess o f the aggregate
                                                                                   While there i s a strong
variance in spending induced by shocks to net resource a ~ a i l a b i l i t y . ~ ~
overlap between the l i s t o f the 20 largest budget heads and the l i s t o f poverty reducing programs,
this alternative measure has the advantage o f explicitly accounting for aggregate shocks such as
the shortfall in fourth quarter 2008 donor aid. In addition, it i s noteworthy that the share o f
discretionary spending allocated to poverty reducing priorities has consistently increased over
time, from 32 percent o f the total in 2001 to 74 percent o f the total in 2008. A third trigger, for
the HRMO to begin i t s work, was met as originally intended in substance and in spirit. A more
substantive prior action, demonstrating that HRMO has been actively performing i t s new duties
has been substituted for the original trigger.

                                                FOR THE NEXT        POLICY OPERATION

5.36 I t i s expected that a new series o f programmatic development policy operations will
follow the proposed credit. The new series would focus on supporting policy reforms and
actions planned by the Government in the PRSP I1 to enhance the country's policy and
institutional fiamework for sustainable growth and poverty reduction, and consequently the
effective use o f development assistance. Specifically, the Government has indicated i t s intention
to focus on those areas identified in the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment that are in
need o f strengthening or consolidation (see Annex 7). In this respect, the Government intends to
focus on four areas: (1) consolidate recent improvements in economic management and reduce
macroeconomic risks (in Cluster A o f the CPIA); (2) improve the regulatory environment for
trade and business (in Cluster B o f the CPIA); improve gender equality and equity o f public
resources and implement policies and institutions for environmental sustainability (in Cluster 3
o f the CPIA); and (4) improve the quality o f public sector administration and institutions (in
Cluster D o f the CPIA).

5.37 The indicative triggers for the first operation in the new programmatic series o f
development policy operations will be informed by the degree o f progress towards, or completion
of, the indicative reforms discussed below and listed in Table 5.3, which focus on policy actions


                                                                31
to (1) consolidate recent improvements in economic management that could be easily reversed
and reduce macroeconomic risks (in Cluster A o f the CPIA), and (2) improve the quality o f
public sector administration and institutions (in Cluster D o f the CPIA) where policies and
outcomes are particularly lagging the average performance o f other countries. The choice o f
triggers for the first operation on the new series i s informed by preliminary MDBS discussions
regarding the 2009-10 Progress Assessment Framework, the 2008 CPIA outcomes most in need
o f improvement relative to average IDA scores, lessons learned from previous operations, the
selection o f other binding benchmarks by the AfDB, DBD and EC, and recent analytical work
(notably the FY 10 PER).

                           Box 5.1: Good Practice Principles on Conditionality

Ownership:            Reinforce country ownership. A l l of the prior actions for GRGC-3 are consistent with the
                      government's own PRS. Ownership i s routinely validated during the pre-appraisal and appraisal
                      phases.

Harmonization:        Agree up front with the government and other financial partners on a coordinated accountability
                      framework. This i s achieved through the MDBS PAF, jointly negotiated and agreed on an annual
                      cycle (See Section 4.D above).

Customization:        Customize the accountability framework and modalities of Bank support to country circumstances.
                      This i s achieved in the broad sense through consistency with the PRS. The framework i s also
                      reviewed and revised annually, in response to evolving circumstances.

Criticality:          Choose only actions critical for achieving results as conditions for disbursement. The number o f
                      donor benchmarks, including those from the Bank, was reduced to 27 in 2008 and 14 in 2009 from
                      42 in 2006. Further efforts to consolidate the PAF on the basis of criticality will be pursued. The
                      proposed operation includes a subset o f five prior actions drawn from the PAF.
Transparency
and predictability:   Conduct transparent progress reviews conducive to predictable and performance-based financial
                      support. The PAF provides a pre-established and harmonized framework for the evaluation o f
                      performance through specific baselines and outcomes. Based on lessons learned from the first and
                      second PAF reviews, the donors are also seeking to spell out more clearly the criteria that will be
                      used in assessing progress for each benchmark.



5.38 Triggers for the second and third development policy operations in the new programmatic
series would support policy reforms and actions to address elements o f CPIA clusters B and C
while broadening and deepening reforms in clusters A and D. It should be noted that
complementary support for efforts in these areas i s also currently provided by the Bank and other
donors as follows: 1) progress in increasing the efficiency o f the civil service i s supported
through projects funded by DBD, EC, and UNDP; and 2) decentralized public service delivery
will be supported through the Decentralized Service Delivery Project. The reform agenda i s
under discussion and will be better defined in the first operation o f the next series.

5.39 Development Objective One: Improve the Quality o Economic Management. Despite
                                                                  f
sustained improvements in economic management, the country's macroeconomic performance
remains vulnerable to growing contingent liabilities, high energy costs and limited resources for
public investments. Specifically, the FY 10 PER indicates that the accumulation and management
o f contingent liabilities, mainly by public utilities, i s a growing problem. The review concluded



                                                           32
that the legal framework for public debt management does not adequately address the issue o f
contingent liabilities. At the same time, there i s also a need to update and modernize the laws
and regulations governing public debt management. The government plans to submit a bill to
Parliament that will govern public debt management including the accumulation and
management o f contingent liabilities. This policy action w i l l contribute to public debt
sustainability and a clearly defined legal framework for public borrowing (CPIA indicator 3).

5.40 The completion o f the BHP will allow the sale o f low-cost hydro-electric power to the
N P A for distribution to industrial and household consumers. This should induce a substantial
productivity gain for the economy. At the same time, there will be less need for imported fuel,
inducing a parallel reduction in pressure on the exchange rate. To take advantage o f this
opportunity, while also safeguarding the financial viability o f NPA, the Cabinet w i l l approve a
phased transition to a cost-based, formula driven electricity tariff informed by a poverty and
social impact analysis. This policy action will contribute to fiscal sustainability and price
stability (CPIA indicator l), contribute to the level and quality o f public goods provision
                              and
(CPIA indicator 2).

5.41 The FYlO PER indicates that resource constraints will make it difficult to fully fund the
priority investments identified in the PRSP 1 . Public-private partnerships provide an opportunity
                                             1
to attract the necessary resources without creating unsustainable fiscal burdens. At present,
however, Sierra Leone lacks the legal framework to support public-private-partnerships. The
government intends to prepare and submit to Parliament a bill to regulate the formation o f
public-private partnerships to encourage investment, particularly in infrastructure, while
minimizing risks to the government (CPIA indicator 2).

5.42 Development Objective Two: Improve Public Sector Management and Institutions.
Despite recent progress, Sierra Leone's quality o f public sector management and institutions
remains below the average for low income countries and the Government intends to make a
concerted effort to strengthen it. O f particular concern are the institutional set up for public
investment management, the quality o f budget execution, the need to accelerate procurement
reform, and low revenue mobilization.

5.43 The FY10 PER indicates that there i s little in the way o f a legal fkamework to regulate the
selection, implementation, and monitoring o f public investment projects, despite the PRSP 11's
call for significant public investments in several areas. Project implementation i s often slow and
the quality o f monitoring often precludes opportunities to take timely and effective corrective
action. The government therefore plans to submit to Parliament amendments to the Government
Budgeting and Accountability Act (2005) and the Financial Management Regulations (2007) in
support o f an appropriate fkamework for public investment. This policy action will contribute to
better expenditure policies and priorities (CPIA indicator 13a).

5.44 The FYlO PER shows that the quality o f budget execution continues to allow large
deviations from budgeted expenditures. As a consequence, poverty reducing programs are
frequently under-spent (See also Table 5.1 above). To address this issue, the authorities w i l l
continue to improve their expenditure controls so that the variance in expenditure composition in
2009 for the 20 largest budget heads will not exceed the overall deviation in domestic primary


                                                33
expenditures by more than 10 percentage points and reduce the use o f the miscellaneous budget
head 501. This policy action will contribute t o better budget execution, with minimal deviations
from the budget (CPIA indicator 13b), and to improve the level and quality o f public goods
provision (CPIA indicator 2).

contingent liabilities.

(2) Approval by Cabinet of a phased transition to a cost-based, formula driven electricity tariff informed by a poverty and social
impact analysis.

Management Regulations (2007) in support of an appropriate framework for public investment.

(5) The variance in expenditure composition in 2009 for the 20 largest budget heads will not exceed the overall deviation in
domestic primary expenditures by more than 10 percentage points, and the portions of budget head 501 assigned to the Office of
the Vice-president and to Miscellaneous Services General will be reassigned to other appropriate budget heads and, starting from
January 2010, all remaining expenditures from budget head 501, or any other budget head for unallocated expenditures, will be
made in full conformity with sections 25(4) and 25(5) of the Government Budgeting and Accountability Act (2005).

(6) T h e government will have met, or made substantial progress towards, the following procurement benchmarks:
    i) At least 50 public entities will have prepared procurement plans for 2010 that are approved by MOFED or other
         applicable oversight institutions, including each o f the 45 that produced plans in 2009.
    ii) The share of 20 randomly selected 2010 procurement plans that meet agreed criteria47for good quality will increase by 5
         percentage points over the benchmark of 42 percent established against 2009 procurement plans. In addition at least 10
         plans will be completed and approved by MOFED before January 1,2010.
    iii)The share of procurement transactions in 2009, for entities with approved procurement plans, which are conducted
         through open competition, will improve by 6 percentage points over the benchmark of 69 percent established against the
         2008 procurement transactions.
    iv) MOFED will have established a procurement unit and a procurement committee in compliance with the applicable
         procurement law and regulations.
                        ~




(7) Submission to Parliament of a law or amendments to the laws governing taxation of income and external trade that will
reduce the opportunities for discretionary tax exemptions and increase the transparency and accountability of exemption
decisions.
                    ~                      ~




(8) Submission to Parliament of a Freedom of Information Act.


5.45   The reform o f public procurement i s a long-run process that will need to be continued and
entrenched. To this end, the authorities are resolved to broaden the use o f and enhance the


47   The agreed criteria and benchmarks drawn from 45 approved procurement plans for 2009 are as follows: i)
     number of public procuring entities that provide only one plan per procurement category (goods, works, services):
     42 out o f 45; ii)                                                         i)
                       number o f plans with all details filled in: 44 o f 45; i i number o f plans that are fully consistent
     with the procurement Act and Regulations: 34 o f 45; iv) number o f plans that do not include any attempts to split
     procurements: 29 o f 45.
quality and timeliness o f the procurement plans used by ministries and other public entities and
to improve on the execution o f those plans. The government will also improve the procurement
capacity o f the Ministry o f Finance and Economic Development. This policy action will
contribute to better expenditure efficiency and control systems (CPIA indicator 13b).

                                                                               1
5.46 In order to help finance the ambitious plans set out in the PRSP 1 , the government's
revenue effort needs to be strengthened. As noted in Section 5.B above, part o f the reason why
the revenue effort in Sierra Leone (11.4 percent o f GDP in 2008) i s low relative to other low
income countries i s the excessive use o f discretionary tax exemptions. As much as one-third o f
all collectable revenues may be foregone due to exemptions, only some o f which are mandated
by law or treaty. To address this problem, the government plans the submission to Parliament o f
a law or amendments to the laws governing taxation o f income and external trade that will reduce
the opportunities for discretionary tax exemptions and increase the transparency and
accountability o f exemption decisions. This policy action would contribute to a higher revenue
effort and increase the transparency o f preferential treatment (CPIA indicators 14a and 14b).48

5.47 Policy making i s improved in an environment o f open discussion, supported by free
access to information. Openness and transparency and a free exchange o f information engender
trust between institutions o f government and i t s citizens. Freedom o f information can thus be a
key tool in conflict prevention. In addition, access to information has been shown to be
fundamental to eradicating corruption. For all o f these reasons, the government plans the
submission to Parliament o f a Freedom o f Information Act. This reform will supplement other
ongoing efforts aimed at greater transparency and accountability. Among these are annual
government led Public Expenditure Tracking exercises that have been instrumental in revealing
and resolving leakages in key sectors, the formation in 2005 o f district budget oversight
committees to monitor budget formation and execution in the new local governments, and the
introduction o f participatory budget hearings in 2006 to allow a wide range o f stakeholders,
including civil society organizations, to have a voice in budget formulation.


                               6. OPERATION IMPLEMENTATION

                                           A. PARTICIPATION PROCESS

6.1     The design o f the programmatic series, including the key reforms supported by the
proposed operation, benefited from broad stakeholder consultations conducted by the
government as part o f the preparation o f the f i r s t and second PRSPs. The PRSP consultations
included cabinet ministers, parliamentarians, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), members
of civil society, the private sector, cooperative associations, local authorities, religious leaders,
development partners and beneficiary groups. The participatory methodologies included the
Strategic Planning and Action Process, Focus Group Discussions and Participatory Poverty


48
     This action overlaps with the first development objective for the quality o f economic management. I t i s assigned
     to the second development objective for public sector management because it i s tightly linked to CPIA indicators
     14a and 14b in Cluster D.


                                                           35
Assessments. In addition, the last two M D B S reviews o f the P A F conducted in 2008 and 2009
included consultations with representatives from civil society.49

                                      B.   POVERTY AND SOCIAL IMPACTS

6.2      The measures supported by the proposed GRGC-3 are expected to have a significant
positive direct impact on poverty reduction. N o adverse social or poverty impacts are expected
from the prior actions supported by the proposed credit. First, the strengthening o f public
financial management would enhance efficiency, transparency and accountability in public
investments and service delivery. Such measures would also increase the country's absorption
capacity for external resources. Second, the support provided to the decentralization o f public
services should have the effect o f reducing inequality. Indeed, the data from the 2003/04
household survey and pilot CWIQ show that the districts outside the Western Area, where the
capital o f Freetown i s located, generally suffer higher levels o f poverty and reduced levels o f
public services. Data from the 2007 and 2008 Service Delivery Perception Surveys suggest there
have been moderate gains in the quality o f educational and health services in many districts. Yet,
there is clear room for improvement: the 2008 Poverty Diagnostic finds that educational services
remain pro-rich when adjusted for the quality o f teachers while cost remains an obstacle to health
care for many o f the poor. Third, the Poverty Diagnostic finds that the increase in the 2008
electricity tariff could be pro-poor if it results in the release o f resources that could be better
targeted to the poor through other poverty reducing programs. There are two reasons for this.
First, the poor have very l i t t l e access to publicly provided electricity. Most o f the access is found
in the capital city, Freetown, and the distribution o f access is highly biased away from the poor:
only 1.6 percent o f the poorest households have access to electricity while 10 percent o f the 5th
decile have access. Second, the current budgetary allocation for fuel for emergency power was
the single largest item in the 2008 budget largely because the tariff was insufficient to cover
operating costs. This denied resources to other, better targeted, poverty reducing program^.^' In
2009, the electricity tariff increase allowed the N P A to transfer approximately L e 10 billion to
the central government budget in the first half o f the year. This i s the equivalent o f 6 percent o f
the budget for pro-poor HIPC priorities in the first half o f the year5' (See also paragraph 3.3 o n
the expansion o f spending for HIPC priorities to 6 percent o f GDP by 2010 and the footnote to
paragraph 4.19 on second round effects).

                                                        ASPECTS
                                           C. ENVIRONMENTAL

6.3     The specific actions supported by the proposed GRGC-3 are not likely to have significant
positive or negative effects o n Sierra Leone's environment, forests or other natural resources.
Specifically, the measures supported by the proposed operation to preserve the fiscal space
needed for poverty reduction and enhance public financial management and governance,
including decentralization, are not expected to have a negative effect o n the country's
                                  ~




49 Representatives from approximately 10-12 organizations attended at the conclusion o f the 2008 and 2009 reviews.
   Discussions were organized to promote an exchange o f views after a briefmg on the outcome o f each review.
50
   A new PSIA will be conducted to examine the impact o f a tariff reduction via the introduction o f a cost based,
   formula driven electricity tariff, a trigger for the first operation in the next series.
51 The budget target for poverty related expenditures in 2009 i s Le33 1 billion.

environment and natural resources. The potential environmental effects stem from the electricity
tariff increase if they lead to a sustained increase in carbon emissions.

6.4     Household survey data show that the vast majority o f the population does not use
                                                                 1
electricity for lighting or cooking. According to the PRSP 1 , 91 percent o f households use
kerosene for lighting, while only 2.7 percent use public electricity for lighting. According to the
        1
PRSP 1 , 85 percent o f households use firewood for cooking, 14 percent use charcoal, and almost
none use public electricity. In view o f these data, any short-run changes in lighting or cooking
patterns that might result from a temporarily higher electricity tariff would be quite small and
would not result in any significant environmental impacts. The sustained provision o f affordable
hydroelectricity would, over the long-run, induce a shift in lighting and cooking preferences
towards electrical appliances that would have a substantially lower carbon-footprint than
kerosene or charcoal.

                         D.   IMPLEMENTATION, MONITORINGEVALUATION
                                                      AND

6.5    The administration o f this operation w i l l be the responsibility o f MOFED. To facilitate
program implementation and the coordination o f activities, the government has appointed an
Inter-ministerial Steering Committee chaired by the Minister o f Finance and Economic
Development. This Committee i s composed o f key Ministers and the Governor o f the BSL. The
Steering Committee will be assisted by a Technical Committee comprising high level staff from
various line ministries and the BSL. The Technical Committee will be chaired by the Financial
Secretary and will be responsible for coordinating the activities o f all government agencies
involved in program implementation.

6.6     The Technical Committee will be responsible for monitoring the program and all
outcome indicators (detailed in Annex 3). The Technical Committee will provide monthly
reports to the World Bank and other multi-donor budget support partners on implementation
progress measured against established timetables and agreed performance indicators. The overall
reform effort will be reviewed by the government in close coordination with regular Bank
missions to ensure continued implementation o f the program within an adequate macroeconomic
policy framework.

6.7    The elements o f the government program backed by Multi-Donor Budget Support in 2009
are shown in Annex 4. I t captures all the benchmarks from the budget support programs o f each
MDBS partner as they were set out in late 2008.52 Annex 4 also contains a number o f output and
outcome indicators. These indicators help the authorities and the MDBS donors evaluate the
impact o f the government program.

6.8    In addition, as mentioned above, a PRS monitoring function has been established within
MOFED. The Central Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation unit within MOFED i s expected to
coordinate with the planning, monitoring and evaluation units within each ministry to produce
annual PRSP progress reports.

52
     The first formal MDBS Progress Assessment Framework covering multiple sectors was adopted shortly after
     GRGG-1 was approved. The kamework i s revised and updated annually.

                                           E. FIDUCIARYASPECTS

6.9     Key documents for issues related to public resource management include the 2007 PEFA
Report, the 2007 procurement audit, the 2004 HIPC AAP, the 2004 and 2009 PER, the 2002
Country Financial Accountability Assessment, the corruption surveys from 2000 and 2002 and
background papers for the IRCB. To address the issues raised in these reports, the government
has embarked on a wide ranging series o f reforms detailed in section 5.B.2 including the
establishment o f an Anti-Corruption Commission, new legislation governing public budgeting
and accounting, strengthening the offices o f the Accountant-General and Auditor-General,
improved management information systems, a new organic finance law and supporting
regulations, and a new public procurement law.

6.10 The government i s committed to deepening these reforms. This effort will be guided by
the common National Action Plan on Public Financial Management currently supported by DfID,
EC, IMF and the World Bank.53 The plan includes: (i)                actions designed to strengthen the
                                                                i)
financial regulations in compliance with the GBAA; ( i actions meant to improve the budget
process such as capacity building for strategic planning and budgeting in the sector ministries;
(iii)procurement reform; (iv) better budget execution (including a new Integrated Financial
Management Information System and chart o f accounts, less arrears, minimal discrepancy
between planned and actual spending); (v) strengthened internal audit (including the
establishment o f internal audit u n i t s in the line ministries); (vi) and strengthened external audit
and accountability (including more trained staff in the Office o f the Auditor-General). In the
context o f the GRGC-3 preparation, the Bank has reviewed fiduciary arrangements.

6.1 1 The IMF conducted a safeguards assessment o f the Bank o f Sierra Leone in 2002 and
2006. The 2006 assessment shows that significant progress has been made on the priority
recommendations o f the 2002 assessment. A follow-up report from 2009 indicates continued
progress: International Financial Reporting Standards were introduced and implemented in
2007; the internal audit function i s being strengthened; and the government has issued Le50
billion in 2008 as i t s capital subscription to the BSL per a Memorandum o f Understanding
established with MOFED in 2006 regarding BSL capitalization. Further improvements in the
internal and external audit functions were recommended.

6.12 Overall, the Bank has judged the government's commitment to the PFM improvements
and i t s performance in implementing the PFM reform program, including procurement reform, as
showing adequate improvement. In this light, additional fiduciary arrangements beyond those
already included in the national PFM action plan are not considered necessary for this operation.

                                     F. DISBURSEMENT AUDITING
                                                  AND

6.13    The operation would consist o f a single tranche o f SDR 6.4 million (US$lO million
equivalent) to be available upon effectiveness. The proposed operation will follow IDA'S
disbursement procedures for development policy credits. Once the operation becomes effective,
and at the request o f the Borrower, the proceeds will be deposited by IDA into a government

account at the Bank o f Sierra Leone which forms part o f the country's foreign exchange reserves.
As a due diligence measure, within 30 days o f receipt the Borrower will provide a written
confirmation to IDA when the amount has been credited to an account available to finance
budgeted expenditures. Disbursement would not be linked to specific purchases. The proceeds
o f the operation would not be used to finance expenditures excluded under the Agreement. If,
after being deposited in a government account, the proceeds o f the operation are used for
ineligible purposes as defined in the Financing Agreement, IDA will require the Borrower to
either: (a) apply the corresponding amount to eligible purposes, or (b) refund the amount directly
to IDA. N o designated account i s required for this operation.


                                G.   R I S K S AND RISK MITIGATION

6.14 Several risks could jeopardize the expected outcomes and benefits o f this operation, but
                                                                                       i)
                                                            macroeconomic shocks; ( iweak
measures are being taken to mitigate them. These include: (i)
institutional capacity and corruption; and (iii)   government's commitment to sustain the
implementation o f the reform program.

6.15 R i s k s fkom exogenous shocks are significant. These include a prolongation o f the global
recession, another rapid rise in international commodity prices for food or fuel, a further decline
in the country's export prices, or new and unavoidable expenditure obligations. There i s a small
associated risk that the authorities might seek to finance a stimulus package through inflationary
money creation if other resources are not available. The risks created by such shocks to
macroeconomic stability and PRS implementation are mitigated by the Government's track
record o f satisfactory macroeconomic performance and ongoing intense dialogue o f the IMF, the
World Bank and the multi-donor budget support donors with the Government on macroeconomic
policies and the reform program. In addition, the Bank will continue to monitor the impact o f the
global recession and assess the need for further support if needed, such as the planned expansion
o f the cash for work program.

6.16     Weak institutional capacity or corruption could hamper the implementation o f the
reforms supported by the proposed operation or the broader Poverty Reduction Strategy. This
risk was evident in late 2007 and early 2008 when capacity in the central ministries and local
councils was temporarily reduced as a consequence o f the natural replacement o f various key
officials as a result o f the political transition. MOFED officials indicated they have largely
resolved the problem through intensive dialogue and monitoring with the implementing
ministries and local councils. In addition, inadequate training in procurement procedures could
slow the effective broadening o f procurement reform, and weak accounting skills in district
governments could make it harder to account for the use o f resources transferred to local
councils. These risks are mitigated by the choice and design o f the supported measures which
are calibrated to existing capacity, the provision o f extensive technical assistance through
ongoing or planned projects (including IRCB support for training in procurement and accounting
skills) and growing involvement o f civil society in oversight activities.

6.17 Weak government commitment, political opposition, or resistance from vested interests
can represent important obstacles to reform, especially reforms that foster transparency and



                                                39
accountability in the use o f public resources. Under the proposed operation, these risks are
mitigated by the fact that all policy measures are implemented before credit approval. The
commitment o f the Government, as exemplified by the progress already made under the first and
second operations in the programmatic series, and continued Bank engagement also enhance the
likelihood that reforms are being followed through and policies sustained.

6.18 In staffs assessment, the potential benefits o f the proposed operation outweigh the
residual risks and warrant IDA'Sassistance for implementing critical reforms and policy actions
in coordination with other donors, while supporting risk mitigation actions to maximize the
sustainability o f the reform agenda.

               THIRD GOVERNANCE REFORM AND GROWTH CREDIT

                          LETTER OF DEVELOPMENT POLICY

1.       Iam writing on behalf o f the Government o f Sierra Leone to request the approval o f the
third Governance Reform and Growth Credit (GRGC 1 1 in the s u m o f US$lO million equivalent
                                                       1)
to support Sierra Leone's transition from post conflict to sustainable development in the context
o f the country's second Poverty Reduction Strategy - the Agenda for Change.

2.       Mr. President, Sierra Leone has made significant progress in maintaining political and
economic stability with the continued support o f the international community, substantial
progress has also been made in implementing governance, particularly public financial
management reforms to improve accountability, transparency, efficiency and effectiveness in the
use o f public resources, thereby laying the basis for sustainable growth and poverty reduction.

3,     Following the successful implementation o f the first Poverty Reduction Strategy in 2007,
the new administration initiated efforts in 2008 to develop a second Poverty Reduction Strategy
in order to address poverty in a comprehensive manner. The second PRSP-the Agenda for
Change was finalized and endorsed by Parliament in M a y 2009. While maintaining
macroeconomic stability, including through improving domestic revenue mobilization and
avoiding unsustainable domestic and external debt burden, the strategy outlines policies to:

   Ensure energy security by providing a reliable power supply, which will be met through
   expanding electric generating capacity and the distribution network, improving management
   and regulation o f the sector, and strengthening revenue collection.


                                               42
     Develop the national transportation network to enable the movement o f goods and people and
     thereby encourage investment and economic activity.
     Enhance productivity in agriculture by promoting commercial agriculture, through private
     sector participation, and subsistence farming by providing inputs to encourage intensified
     production, and improved extension delivery and resource management systems.
*    Improve human development through enhanced investment in public services such as health
     and education.
     Consolidate governance by enforcing the implementation o f the anti-corruption agenda and
     expanding access to justice.

4.     The Agenda for Change also clearly outlined the key strategies for achieving the above-
mentioned priorities. These include:

     Enhance capacity o f the security forces, institutions and agencies.
     Support local governance through improved decentralization.
     Strengthen the Anti-Corruption Commission.
     Strengthen the Rule o f Law, improve access to justice, and justice service delivery.
     Attitudinal change.

                           Recent Economic Developments (2006-2008)

5.      Following a period o f relatively stable macroeconomic environment characterized by
strong growth, low inflation, sustainable external debt levels, and stable exchange rate during
2006-07, Sierra Leone's economic prospects are being adversely affected by the impact o f the
ongoing global financial and economic crisis. The economy grew by an average o f 6.7 percent
during 2006-2007 underpinned by buoyant activities in the agricultural, construction, mining and
services sectors. However, the negative impact o f the international food and fuel crisis and the
global financial meltdown slightly dampened the growth prospects o f the economy in 2008. Real
GDP slowed down to 5.5 percent in 2008 compared to the earlier projection o f 6.4 percent.

6.           Inflation was contained in single digit with annual average inflation declining to 9.5
percent in 2006. Inflationary pressures re-emerged in the first quarter o f 2007 with annual average
inflation reaching 11.O percent owing to supply shocks and the rise in the prices o f food and
petroleum products. Inflationary pressures persisted in the first half o f 2008 but moderated toward
the end o f the year due to the decline in the international prices o f food and fuel. End o f period
inflation declined to 12.2 percent in 2008 from 13.8 percent in 2007. Annual average inflation
was 14.8 percent in 2008. Exports grew strongly by 28.3 percent in 2006 due to the resumption of
r u t i l e and bauxite mining. However, export growth slowed to 2.9 percent in 2007 and dropped
sharply by 9.2 percent in 2008 mainly on account o f the impact o f global financial and economic
crisis, which resulted in lower demand for minerals-the country's main exports.

7.     Imports grew by an average o f 2.0 percent during 2006-07 and increased sharply by 24.7
percent in 2008, reflecting the higher international prices o f petroleum and food imports. The
current account deficit, including grants, averaged 3.4 percent during 2006-07. Reflecting the
sharp decline in exports combined with higher import bill due the rising fuel and food prices, the



                                                 43
current account deficit, including official transfers increased to 11 percent o f GDP in 2008 from
3.5 percent in 2006.

8.      Gross international reserves decreased from 4.7 months o f imports in 2006 to 4.5 months
o f imports in 2008. The nominal exchange rate o f the Leone to the U S dollar remained relatively
stable during 2006 and 2007 and the first half o f 2008 but has since depreciated due to a decline in
the availability o f foreign exchange as export receipts and remittances continued to decline.

9.      Government continued to adopt measures to address the fiscal challenges during the
period. Accordingly, the overall budget deficit, including grants and MDRI, f e l l from 9.3 percent
o f GDP in 2006 to 4.8 percent o f GDP in 2008.

10.     Monetary policy remained proactive. Although broad money growth increased to 26.4
percent in 2008 from 18.9 percent in 2006, reserve money growth subsided to 10.2 percent at end
2008 from 26.0 percent in 2007 reflecting a tighter monetary policy stance. Reserve money growth
in 2008 was lower than programmed because the BSL actively conducted open market operations
by selling from the new holding o f treasury bills obtained by converting non-interest bearing, non-
marketable Government securities.

 11.    Commercial bank credit to the economy continued to grow, primarily in the
telecommunications, commerce, and construction sectors. The entry o f three new banks in mid-
2008 supported the increase in bank credit and the demand for Government securities. This and a
decline in inflation helped push down the average interest rate on treasury bills from 21.3 percent
at end 2007 to about 9 percent at end 2008.

                         Economic Performance in the First Half o f 2009

12.     Economic growth prospects in 2009 have been seriously weakened by the global financial
and economic crisis. Real GDP growth i s expected to slow down to 4 percent relative to the initial
forecast o f 5.5 percent. The mining sector i s particularly adversely affected as the value o f exports
has fallen, production i s being scaled back and investment projects in the sector are being held
back.

13.    Inflationary pressure continued to moderate during the first half o f the year with year-on-
year inflation declining to 7.8 percent in June 2009 from 12.2 percent in December 2008.
Correspondingly, the average 12 month inflation rate f e l l to 11.9 percent in June 2009 compared to
13.7 percent in June 2008.

 14.     The decline in inflation reflects the decline in the international prices o f food and fuel in
the first half o f 2009. The exchange rate has nonetheless come under pressure depreciating by 6.8
percent in nominal terms with respect to the U S dollar between January and June 2009 on account
o f the scarcity o f foreign exchange as export receipts and remittances declined. The pass-through
effect o f the depreciation o f the exchange rate i s beginning to fuel inflationary pressures in the
second half o f 2009. End o f period inflation rose to 9.3 percent in July 2009 compared to the
programme target o f 9.0 percent for the year.


                                                 44
15.    Exports declined by 13.6 percent in the first half o f 2009 compared to the same period in
2008 mainly due the decline in mineral export, which declined by 21.8 percent. The decrease in
mineral exports was partly offset by a sharp increase in agricultural exports. Imports also declined
by 2.8 percent in the first half o f 2009 compared the same period in 2008. The decline in imports
was o n account o f the decrease in food and fuel imports, which fell by 13.9 percent and 46.8
percent respectively, due mainly to the decline in prices o f these items on the international market.

16.   Gross foreign reserves amounted to US$205.24 or 4.7 months o f imports as o f June 2009
compared to the programme target o f US$218 million for the year.

          MEDIUM-TERM MACROECONOMIC OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES

17.    Our medium-term policy agenda will focus on reducing poverty by stimulating economic
growth while preserving macroeconomic stability. The policies to achieve these objectives are
elaborated in the second-generation Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP)- the Agenda for
Change.

 18.    The medium-term macroeconomic objectives have been revised to reflect the impact o f
the global recession. Weaker global demand i s expected to slow growth in the mining and service
sectors as the drop in export prices, worker remittances, and foreign direct investment feeds into
domestic economic activity. However, output growth should continue to benefit from improved
supply o f energy, ongoing public initiatives to increase agriculture productivity and
intensification, and higher public investment in basic infrastructure.

 19.    Real GDP growth i s projected to decline to 4 percent during 2009 and then gradually
increase to 6 percent in 2012. Lower commodities prices should continue to ease inflationary
pressure. Inflation i s projected to decline from 12.2 percent during 2008 to 9.5 percent during
2009 and remain in single digits thereafter. The external current account deficit, excluding
transfers, is projected to improve to 9.4 percent o f GDP in 2009, reflecting an improvement in
exports in the second half o f the year. The external position is expected to continue to improve
beyond 20 10 in line with the projected improvement in the global environment and a rebound in
mining production following the expected reopening o f the K o i d u diamond mine.

                                           Fiscal Policy

20.     Fiscal policy will aim to maintain capital and poverty-reducing spending while
safeguarding macroeconomic stability. Following the projected decline to 11 percent o f GDP in
2009, domestic revenue is projected to rise thereafter to 13 percent o f GDP in 2012. The
Government will step up efforts to improve tax administration and broaden the tax base.
Measures include (i)   accelerating the introduction o f the taxpayer identification number and
                                                   i)
establishment o f the domestic tax department; ( i enforcing the provisions in the existing tax
legislation with the aim o f eliminating tax evasion and ad-hoc tax exemptions; (iii)intensifying
field audits and enforcement o f the payment o f tax arrears (with interest and penalties on
undedlate payment o f tax); and (iv) adopting a new, modern Customs A c t and associated



                                                45
customs regulations. Moreover, the introduction o f the GST i s scheduled for January 1, 2010
following Cabinet adoption o f the implementing regulations.

                             Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies

21.     Money growth will continue to be restrained to further reduce inflation. The aim i s to
reach single-digit inflation by end 2009 and beyond. To achieve this, reserve money i s targeted to
grow by about 8 percent in 2009 and by moderate in 201 1 and 2012 which, given the
Government's domestic financing requirement, would allow for adequate expansion in private
sector credit and a small buildup o f international reserves.

22.     To enhance the BSL's ability to conduct open market operations (OMOs) the
Government will convert an additional L e 60 billion o f noninterest-bearing, nonmarketable
Government securities into marketable ones in 2009. The BSL has already converted Le10
billion during the first quarter o f the year. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will continue
to meet on a monthly basis.

23.     The Government will examine the need to extend the monetary policy instruments
available to the BSL. It will explore the possibility o f providing the BSL with the authority to
change the reserve requirement ratio at i t s discretion and introducing central bank bills for
OMOs. Currently, any change to the reserve requirement ratio requires parliamentary approval.
The commercial banks and discount houses w i l l use the interbank market as their primary source
o f short-term liquidity needs. The Government i s actively considering the introduction o f long
term Government securities to support medium to long term infrastructure investment.

24.       Exchange rate flexibility will be maintained. The BSL will continue to seek to balance
between Treasury bill sales and foreign exchange auctions for an optimal monetary policy mix.
I t s offers on the foreign exchange market will also be dictated by the need to meet i t s foreign
exchange reserves target.

                                       External Debt Policy

25.     Mr. President, as you are aware, Sierra Leone reached the Completion Point under the
enhanced HIPC Initiative in December 2006 and became eligible for debt relief under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Sierra Leone i s at a moderate risk o f debt distress.
Thus, Government will continue to implement a prudent external debt policy, seeking grant
financing whenever possible and contracting or guaranteeing only highly concessional loans to
ensure the sustainability o f i t s external debt.

26.    However, debt owed to commercial creditors i s s t i l l outstanding and efforts to negotiate
with them have proved increasingly difficult. To address the situation, Government requested the
World Bank to support a second debt buy-back operation for external commercial obligations.
Negotiations are on-going with the non-Paris Creditors to reach debt r e l i e f agreements consistent
with the enhanced HIPC Initiative.

                 PROGRESS IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REFORMS

27.     Mr. President, the Government continues to pursue structural and institutional reforms,
especially public financial management reforms to improve the transparency, accountability,
effectiveness and efficiency in the use o f public resources aimed at promoting sustainable
economic growth and poverty reduction. A new PFM reform program has been approved by our
development partners to consolidate the progress made in the first phase.

28.     This program seeks to deepen reforms and strengthen capacity for effective and efficient
delivery o f basic public services. Key activities that will be undertaken include (i) review o f the
                                                                                      a
legal and regulatory framework for PFM; (ii)     improving budget planning and budget execution to
ensure that funds are directed to national poverty reduction priorities and that the budget process
is participatory, transparent, and accountable; (iii) extending coverage o f the integrated financial
management system, and (iv) strengthening public procurement. The paragraphs below detail
progress that has been made in the implementation o f public financial management reforms
during the first phase.

        Legal and Regulatory Framework for Public Financial Management (PFM)

29.     In recent years, the legal and regulatory framework for PFM has been significantly
strengthened to lay a robust foundation for the implementation o f public financial management
reforms. The Public Procurement A c t was enacted in 2004 while the Government Budgeting and
Accountability Act was passed in 2005. The respective implementing regulations have also been
passed in 2006 and 2007, respectively.

                                           Procurement

30.     To improve transparency and accountability in the public procurement process and hence
minimize waste and fraud, Government established the National Public Procurement Authority
(NPPA) in 2005 following the enactment o f the Public Procurement Act. The NPPA i s
responsible to implement Governments procurement reform programme. The National Public
Procurement Authority, i t s Secretariat, the Independent Review Panel are now staffed and
operational. The procurement requires Ministries, Departments and Agencies to prepare
procurement plans in order to integrate procurement planning into the budget process.

3 1.    Substantial progress has been made in reforming the public procurement process and this
i s beginningto yield very good results. In 2006, 34 percent o f the 2006 contracts above the small
purchase threshold were awarded through competitive processes compared to 10 percent in 2003.
In 2009, 43 ministries and agencies prepared procurement plans compared to 23 a year earlier.
An estimated 120 tenders out o f the 173 above the minimum national threshold were conducted
by open competition. The value o f the competitive tenders was 95 percent o f the total value
above the national threshold.

32.     The NPPA has also been publishing information about ministry procurement plans,
invitations to bid and contract awards in a dedicated website to promote transparency in the



                                                47
procurement process. A survey o f unit prices i s also carried out from time to time to establish
price norms for the procurement o f goods and services by Government agencies about ministry
procurement plans, invitations to bid, contract awards and a survey o f unit prices. The challenge
going forward i s to establish a procurement cadre within the civil service. This is being
considered by the NPPA and the H M O .

                                           Internal Audit

33.     To improve the coverage and quality o f internal audit functions, the Government
Budgeting and Accountability Act requires ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) to
establish and maintain internal audit units (IAUs) which meet international standards. In total,
there are n o w 23 separate IAUs which are functioning in Government, including the main
spending MDAs. These I A U s should h c t i o n independently from the finance department and
report directly to vote controllers. The total staff strength o f internal audit personnel within
Government is n o w in excess o f sixty personnel.

34.    Internal audit plans are now being prepared by each MDA and sent to the Director o f
Internal Audit in the Ministry o f Finance and Economic Development. Currently, there are eight
internal audit units that meet the minimum criteria set by donor partners (Finance and Economic
Development, Defense, Education, Health, Police, National Electoral Commission, Statistics
Sierra Leone, Anti-Corruption and Road Maintenance) and another seven units are being
developed. Four MDAs, the Sierra Leone Police, Ministry o f Defence, Anti-Corruption and
National Electoral Commission have functional internal audit committees in which the senior
internal audit personnel are represented.

                                           ExternalAudit

35.     The Government intends to continue to make progress in bringing-the annual reports o f
the Auditor-General to Parliament on a timely basis and, ultimately, within 12 months o f the
close o f each financial year. The Public Accounts for 2007 has been laid before Parliament.
Currently, the 2006 Report i s being debated by the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), this time
in open hearing session, with the Public having the opportunity to attend hearings. The
application o f the Standing Order 75 has been clarified. The Auditor General's Report on Public
Accounts i s n o w made public immediately as it i s laid before Parliament. I t i s also now available
to all stakeholders and even in the website o f the Audit Service Sierra Leone. The P A C i s
making progress in the deliberations on the Report and may deliberate on the 2007 Accounts this
year, thus bringing its work up to date. The 2008 Public Accounts are currently being audited
and will be laid before Parliament to meet the Statutory Provision o f 3 1st December.

                                    Accounting and Reporting

36.      The Government replaced the old Financial Management and Accounting Systems in the
AGD with a new Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) in 2005 to
facilitate better expenditure control and accounting. In addition to MOFED, the IFMIS had been




                                                 48
installed in seven (7) key M D A s responsible for education, health, agriculture, public works,
external audit, and policing, defence and the prisons.

37.      Plans have been finalized for additional roll-outs to the office o f the President and the
Ministry o f Foreign affairs and International Cooperation during the last quarter o f 2009. Petra
Financials, an accounting software that use the same 27 digits charts o f Account coding structure
utilised by the IFMIS, has been introduced to the Local Councils. The software has been rolled
out t o 8 local councils.

                             Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys

38.    Government continues to undertake Public Expenditure Tracking Surveys (PETS) o n an
annual basis to ascertain whether the amount o f resources disbursed by the Ministry o f Finance
and Economic Development and development partners reach service delivery facilities and other
intended beneficiaries. PETS have also been identified as a tool for monitoring the second
poverty reduction strategy. The PETSs usually cover poverty related expenditures in the social
and economic sectors and key recommendations for improving service delivery are proffered in
the reports. Government has implemented some o f these recommendations, and this has resulted
in changes in the way in which some o f the resources are distributed to front line facilities.

39.     The PETS reports continue t o observe that poor record keeping remains a major challenge
especially in district offices and service delivery facilities such as schools, hospitals and health
centres. The PETS report o n 2007 selected expenditures conducted in October 2008 has been
submitted to Cabinet for review and approval. Preparations are at an advanced stage for the 2009
PETS o n selected 2008 expenditures.

40.     The National Anti-Corruption Strategy Implementation Plan n o w includes further
corrective measures based o n PETS recommendations.

                                     Public Service Reforms

4 1.    Government's commitment t o revamping the public service for improved delivery
remains steadfast. A s part o f this commitment the President created the Public Sector Reform
Unit as an integral part o f the Office o f the President to provide leadership, coordination and
strategic guidance in the implementation and monitoring o f the Government's public sector
reform programme in January 2008. The Human Resource Management Office was officially
launched by the President in August 2008 in succession to the Establishment Secretary's Office
and has been made fully operational. I t s role has broadened to deal with the constituent elements
o f Human Resource Management for the C i v i l Service, the intention being that the Public
Service Commission will be increasingly focused o n strategic and regulatory matters and
overseeing the propriety o f the system.

42.     The HRMO, in collaboration with the PSRU, has developed policies o n recruitment,
training and development, performance management, manpower planning and budgeting. A
policy document o n composite c i v i l service l a w i s being prepared in consultation with



                                                49
stakeholders and the L a w Officers' Department while a new C i v i l Service Regulations and Rules
and C i v i l Service Code have been prepared and will be forwarded t o Cabinet soon.

                                       Records Management

43.    A s a feature o f the Records Management Improvement Program, a payroll verification
exercise for the C i v i l Service was carried out during July to November 2008. Up to 10 percent o f
named personnel were found to be improperly entered while a further 1,000+ are soon due, or
overdue, for retirement. .

44.     Since 2005, the Government has initiated efforts to rebuild the structures required to
manage i t s records as part o f a wider program o f governance reform to strengthen accountability
and address corruption. A Records Management Improvement Programme, supported by DfID
and the EU, has rebuilt recordkeeping systems in four ministries (Human Resource Management
Office, Ministry o f Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security, Ministry o f Health and Sanitation
and Ministry o f Education, Science and Technology).

45.     A particular focus has been o n c i v i l service payroll and personnel records. The project
has introduced a new methodology for rebuilding paper-based personnel records systems and
linking them to the Human Capital Accountability Module o f the Integrated Financial
Management Information System (IFMIS). Between July and November 2008, a c i v i l service
payroll verification exercise was conducted and 15,950 c i v i l servants o n the June 2008 payroll
were interviewed, photographed and fingerprinted. All payroll anomalies have been recorded in
a specially designed database and these are n o w being resolved systematically, based o n the
evidence provided by personnel and biometric records.

46.      The project has so far identified over 3,000 names for removal from the payroll. These
included approximately 600 ghost workers and 2,500 employees who had passed the statutory
age o f retirement. The result so far has been a saving o f over h a l f a billion Leones a month since
February 2009. The verified data o n each c i v i l servant also provides an accurate and reliable
basis for conducting right-sizing. The current phase o f payroll verification work i s funded by
DfID and is due to end in October 2009.

47.    A team o f Sierra Leoneans have been trained and it i s anticipated that they, together with
the small staff o f the Government Archives, will form a new Records Directorate within HRMO.
Ten records management procedures manuals and training materials have been developed to
support the team's work across Government. The team's longer term viability is, however,
dependent o n the creation o f a new records management cadre with i t s own Scheme o f Service
and the passing o f a National Records and Archives A c t to establish a separate Department for
ongoing management o f Government records and archives. The Scheme o f Service and A c t have
been drafted. A proposed organisational structure for the Records and Archives Directorate has
been proposed.

                                     Anti-Corruption Efforts

48.      Government i s aware o f the negative consequence o f pervasive corruption on the socio-
economic wellbeing o f the population. As part o f its effort to improve governance and fight
corruption, Government established the Anti-Corruption commission (ACC) following the
           ,



enactment o f the Anti-Corruption Act in 2000. The ACC recorded some successes during 2005-
07 but was constrained by i t s inability to prosecute corrupt cases, without reference to the Office
o f the Attorney-General and Minister o f Justice.

49.    The new Government i s determined to pursue the fight against corruption more
vigorously. As a manifestation o f that commitment, the Anti-Corruption Act 2000 has been
repealed and replaced with the Anti-Corruption Act 2008.

50.    The amendments to the 2000 Act include creating new offences such as illicit enrichment,
abuse o f office and misuse o f office; providing adequate protection for whistleblowers and
informers; making it compulsory for all public servants to declare their assets and make adequate
provision for international cooperation in the fight against corruption. The amendments have
ensured that the national legislation i s in tandem with the United Nations Convention Against
Corruption (UNCAC), which Sierra Leone has ratified, and the African Union Convention on
preventing and Combating Corruption and Related Offences, which Sierra Leone will soon ratify.
Government also recently revised, adopted and launched the National Anti-Corruption Strategy
(NACS) 2008- 13.

51.     The NACS i s an accentuation o f Government's effort to provide a policy fiamework to
address corruption in a comprehensive and holistic way. A high powered steering committee
chaired by the Minister o f Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation has been established to
ensure that the strategy i s fully implemented. The committee i s supported by a NACS
Secretariat. The commission i s currently working with civil society to develop an abridged and
simplified version o f the strategy for wider public dissemination.

52.   The ACC has also prepared a three-year Strategic Plan (2008-2010). The objectives of the
ACC Strategic Plan are (i) enable the ACC to take a leading role in coordinating the
                            to
implementation o f the NACS; (ii) and attain performance targets for the existing and
                                    set
emerging mandates o f the ACC; and (iii)build capacities required for i t s work.

                                         Decentralization

53.      Over-centralisation o f political power and the management o f public financial resources,
which resulted in the exclusion o f the majority o f the rural population from participating in the
political and economic development process, was one o f the key factors that led to the brutal
armed civil conflict in Sierra Leone. Following the enactment o f the Local Government Act in
2004, Government adopted Decentralization as a key strategy to restore local governance and
facilitate the transfer o f public financial resources from the central to the local authorities to
ensure improved service delivery at the local level.




                                                 51
54.     As at 2009, 37 out o f 80 designated MDA functions have been devolved to the local
councils. The Government, through the World Bank supported Institutional Reform and
Capacity Building project (IRCBP), continues to provide intensive training, technical support and
investment to help the new local councils build basic management capacity and a transparent and
accountable governance system. The 19 local councils have n o w met transparency and financial
accountability requirements. Currently, all the local councils have prepared financial statements
for the 2008 financial year and submitted these statements to the Auditor-General. The audit
Services has also completed the field audits o f the 2008 financial statements. O n a monthly
basis, Local Councils post financial reports o n their respective notice boards. Government
continues to update on an annual basis the grants-based distribution formula t o guide vertical
budgetary provisions and horizontal transfers to local councils for both recurrent and
development expenditures.

                                  Private Sector Development

55.     Private sector development remains a key strategy o f Government to promote sustainable
economic growth and j o b creation. Significant progress has been made in the implementation o f
the recommendations o f the Study o n Administrative Barriers to Investment especially those
relating to business registration, regulatory costs o f operations, investment and export promotion.
In 2007 Government enacted the General L a w o n Business Start-ups and the Registration o f
Business Act, which significantly reduces the complexity and cost o f business registration. The
newly restructured Sierra Leone Investment and Export Promotion Agency (SLIEPA) has been
made fully operational. As a result, Sierra Leone's ranking in the annual Doing Business Report
improved from 156/18 1 in the 2009 edition to 148/183 in the 20 10 edition.

56.     Recently, Government developed a full blown Financial Sector Development Plan based
o n the recommendations from the Financial Sector Assessment Programme (FSDP). The FSDP
addresses four main areas o f the financial system: the commercial banking system, access to
finance, strengthening contractual and long-term savings and strengthening the enabling
environment.

57.    T o encourage private investment, the Companies Act 2009, the Bankruptcy A c t 2009 and
the Payment Systems A c t 2009 have been enacted into law. The Government is also working o n
a Securities A c t and a venture capital scheme.

            THE THIRD GOVERNANCE REFORM AND GROWTH CREDIT

58.     Mr. President, the proposed credit will be used to support key strategies o f the PRSP-I1
                                                            u a
that focuses o n Energy, Agriculture, Transportation and H m n Development. The operation
which i s the third in the series o f Governance Reform and Growth GrantdCredits will
consolidate and deepen the reform agenda set out in GRGG-I and I1by supporting measures to:
    Preserve the fiscal space needed for poverty reduction by protecting HIPC/PRS spending
    priorities;
    Promote efficiency, transparency and accountability in the use o f public resources by
    strengthening the link between resource allocation and the objectives o f growth and poverty



                                                52
       reduction, pursing procurement reform, strengthening the institutional set up for public sector
       reform and strengthening the implementation o f decentralization; and
       Improve the investment climate and promote exports by ensuring the provision o f electricity
       in a fiscally sustainable manner.

           1. Preserving the Fiscal Space Needed f o r Poverty Reduction

59.    The Government, under the HIPC initiative has done a good j o b o f expanding poverty
reducing spending. However, Government's capacity t o fund pro-poor spending and protect
expenditure targets remains weak and needs strengthening due t o the following:

i) Uncertainties and delays in donor disbursements;
 i
i )Miscellaneous budget heads 501 was overspent;
 i)
i i N e w debt obligations arising from the regularization o f selected contingent liabilities.

60.      Furthermore, higher domestic interest obligations following the continued conversion o f
n o n interest bearing securities held by the Bank o f Sierra Leone to interest bearer securities will
further undermine the Government's ability to increase pro-poor spending. In the short-run, the
Government will ensure that:

i) The share o f discretionary budgetary spending in 2008 allocated to poverty reducing priorities
   increases over the 2007 share; and
 i
i )The variance in expenditure composition in 2008 for the 20 largest budget heads will not
   exceed the overall deviation in domestic primary expenditures by more than 10 percentage
       points.

6 1.      Going forward, the Government intends to preserve the fiscal space for poverty reduction
by:

i) Reducing aid volatility and improving aid predictability;
 i
i )Protecting priority expenditures by persuading donors adopting year N+1 disbursement
       decisions;
 i)
i i Pursuing higher revenue effort through the introduction o f the Goods and Services Tax and
    reduction in discretionary tax exemptions; and
iv) The Government and i t s donor partners are exploring the possibility o f protecting basic
    service delivery by channeling funds directly to the local councils via the Decentralized
       Service Delivery Programme.

                         2.Promote Efficiency, Transparency and Accountability
                                     in the Use o f Public Resources

62.     Government remains committed to deepen governance reforms to ensure the effective and
efficient delivery o f services. Important elements o f these reforms will focus o n budget
execution, procurement reform, public service reform and decentralization.




                                                   53
                                               Budget Execution

63.     Government will aim, subject to resource availability, to deliver the level and
composition o f the 2009 and 2010 budgets as approved by Parliament. In this context, I F M I S
will be employed in ways meant to strengthen commitment and expenditure controls. In light o f
the repeated over use seen in previous years o f miscellaneous Budget Head 501, Government
will take measures to reduce the need for it.

 64.   Expenditure control in the development Budget has been especially challenging due to
issues o f internal absorptive capacity and the complexity o f donor procedures for procurement
and release o f funds. The Government will conduct a diagnostic study to be followed by the
adoption and implementation o f a plan o f corrective action. Further work will also be needed for
the identification o f monitorable indicators for each project and program in the development
Budget.

65.    The Government will strengthen the integration o f procurement planning in the budget
process in order to better synchronize sectoral plans with annual budget allocations.

                                             Procurement R e f o r m

66.    Following the establishment o f the required institutions t o implement the procurement
reforms including the national Public Procurement Authority, the Independent Review Panel and
MDA procurement Units and Committees, Government will in the medium term focus o n the
transparency requirements o f the procurement law. In this context, Government will:

i) Ensure that at least 29 public entities will produce 2009 procurement plans, for approval by
      the M O F E D or other appropriate statutory body;
 i
i )Ensure that the share o f total procurement in 2008 that is conducted through open
   competition i s at least 30 percent o f the total for procurements above the national small
    purchase threshold, whether the share is defined in terms o f number o f procurements or value
    o f procurements, for at least 23 entities with approved 2008 procurement plans;
 i)
i i Issue quarterly Procurement Bulletins on a timely basis;
iv) Publish approved procurement plans, notices o f invitations to bids, contracts awarded and
    unit prices for contracts;
v) Post this information o n an N P P A website for wide dissemination; and
vi) Ensure that procurement units and tender committees will continue to receive training from
    N P P A and other sources.

                                            Public Service R e f o r m

67.      The Government considers productivity and performance levels o f the public service as
critical in strengthening the capacity o f the public sector for effective implementation o f national
development programmes and policies including the Agenda for Change. A s a critical step,
Government will ensure that the Human Resource Management Office has demonstrably
discharged its responsibilities for the recruitment, promotion, and retirement o f c i v i l service staff



                                                   54
in grades 1 - 5 between September 2008 and June 2009. The Government will also undertake
the following:

i)      Include improved Records Management as a core component o f i t s new Public Sector
        Reform Program, 2009-20 13. This will strengthen the efficiency o f storage and retrieval o f
        information and the management o f records in 20 MDAs over a four year period.
 i
i)      Build capacity o f the civil service to ensure a sufficient skills-base and address issues o f
        retention and sustainability. To this end, the recommendations o f Management and
        Functional Reviews approved by Cabinet (Education, Health, Agriculture, Local
        Government, and Defense) are scheduled to be implemented. Furthermore, Cabinet will
        adopt a new Policy and Strategy for. Civil Service Training and Development that will
        inform the Strategic Plan for the H R M O Training and Career Development Division. An
        action plan for adoption by the Cabinet that would promote the recruitment and retention o f
        needed professional and technical staff in grades 5 through 10 will also be developed.
 i)
ii      The Government will develop a new personnel policy and procedures which are a)
        efficient, transparent and fair; and b) aimed at attracting and retaining qualified staff and
        motivating commitment, improved performance and ethical conduct.
iv)     Human Resource specialists will be appointed into key ministries to help manage staff
        training and development.
VI      Better integrate manpower policies into the national budget process. The annual budget
        call circular will therefore provide MDAs with guidance on human resource policy while
        annual formal manpower hearings (piloted in key ministries in 2006) will be established as
        an integral part o f the national budget process.
vi)     Future Budget Speeches will provide details o f personnel employment and expenditures for
        all MDAs and LCs with notional estimates for 2010 and 201 1. An additional table will
        summarize total employment and salary ranges by grade.
vii)    Prepare a public service law that will provide the broader legal framework for public
        service management and supporting institutions.
viii)   Improve annually the percentage o f personnel files containing complete records, with initial
        priority on the health sector.

                                                Decentralization

68.    Government's decision to restore local Government and the devolution o f public service
opened up a space for political participation and inclusiveness in public decision making
processes.

69.     Government therefore intends to further deepen the decentralization process through
continued devolution o f functions, transparent and accountable management o f resources and the
elimination o f inconsistencies between various pieces o f Government legislation. Government
will pursue the following actions:

i)      The budgetary funds actually transferred to local councils in the first three quarters o f 2008,
        expressed as a share of total discretionary non-salary, non-interest recurrent spending, will
        be within 3 percentage points o f the budgeted share.



                                                   55
 i
i ) A national policy o n devolution will be elaborated for cabinet approval based o n the series
    o f national and regional consultations held in 2008.
 i)
i i Inconsistencies between the Local Government A c t (2004) and existing laws will be
      resolved particularly for those affecting education, health sector and feeder road
      maintenance.
iv) A Chiefdom Government Policy will be put in place and the Local Government A c t will be
      amended correspondingly.
4 Options to improve the predictability and timelines o f grant transfers will be explored by
      M O F E D and other Stakeholders.
vi) Greater effort will be applied to increasing the Local Government's o w n revenue resources.
vii) A switch will be made to more demand led approaches to capacity building both for the
      LCs and the M D A s for their policy and oversight role.
viii) Government will support national policy o n HR management, in particular the aspects o f
      management o f staff at local level, retention and motivation o f staff, and career mobility.

                                   3. Improve the Investment Climate

70.      The central role o f the private sector in generating wealth and reducing poverty is
                                                                                       ~~




recognized in the second PRSP. Government o n i t s part i s committed t o providing a conducive
environment to spice greater dynamism in private sector activities. In this regard, Government i s
determined to tackle one o f the major constraints to investments in Sierra Leone -access to
reliable and affordable electric power. In this regard, Government plans to undertake reforms
that will strengthen the financial viability and sustainability o f the NPA. These reforms involve a
combination o f reduced operational costs and adjustments in the tariff to reflect changing
production costs. In 2008, this means that N P A revenue collection i s improved by implementing
a tariff increase in the second h a l f o f 2008. The tariff will gradually be revised downwards when
inexpensive hydroelectric power can be distributed. Finally, Government will adopt a medium-
term power sector strategy based o n restructuring NPA, public and private investments, regional
integration and supporting policy reforms.

                                         CONCLUSION

71.     Mr. President, macroeconomic and budgetary management during 2008 and 2009 has
been very challenging due to the adverse impact o f the recent food and fuel crisis and the on-
going financial and economic crisis o n the economy o f Sierra Leone. The mining sector has been
particularly hard hit. This in turn had a negative impact o n mineral exports, which constitute the
bulk o f the exports. Domestic revenue performance i s weak o n account o f the slowdown in
economic activities. This adversely affected the implementation o f the 2009 budget. Hence
poverty related spending was less than projected during the first h a l f o f 2009. The country also
continues to grapple with the challenges o f widespread poverty and high levels o f
unemployment.

72.    Government remains committed to the implementation o f the programmes and policies
presented in the second PRSP including those supported by the series o f Governance Reform and
Growth Credits to address these challenges. This, however, requires continued financial and
technical assistance from our development partners including the World Bank. While


                                                56
Government continues to pursue measures to enhance domestic revenues, the continued support
o f our development partners remains critical in implementing the programmes and policies
articulated in the second PRSP.

73.    Your approval, therefore, o f this credit will facilitate the implementation o f reforms
aimed at tackling the pervasive poverty situation and the high levels o f unemployment, thereby
ensuring political and economic stability for the people o f Sierra Leone.

74.    Please accept, Mr. President, the compliments o f our
highest esteem.


Yours sincerely,

                     Sierra Leone - Assessment L e t t e r by IMF Staff f o r the W o r l d Bank
                                             October 13,2009

Sierra Leone's program supported by the Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) is on track. All
 quantitative performance criteria for June were observed. While economic activity has been negatively
 impacted by the global economic downturn, there are some positive signs o a moderate turnaround in
                                                                          f
 exports. The authorities have indicated that they intend to request a successor IMF arrangement
following the expiration o the current arrangement in M y 2010.
                         f                             a

Recent Economic Developments and Short-Term O u t l o o k

1.       The Sierra Leonean economy has been adversely affected by the global crisis, with slower
economic growth and a steep decline in exports. Falling global demand and declining foreign inflows
from remittances continued to weaken economic activity in the first half o f 2009. However, exports o f
diamonds and agricultural products have picked up in recent months. Although real GDP i s expected to
reach 4 percent in 2009 (down from 5.5 percent in 2008) and increase to 4.7 percent in 2010, downside
risks to growth remain in case o f a slow global economic recovery. Lower f u e l prices and higher
domestic food production contributed to a decline in inflation from double digits in 2008 to 8.3 percent in
August 2009. However, there are upside risks to inflation following the recent depreciation o f the Leone
against the U S dollar.

Fiscal Policy

2.      While domestic revenue i s projected to be on track for 2009, the budget i s under pressure from
unanticipated spending needs, including from additional cost to complete the Bumbuna hydropower
plant, an extension o f the emergency power project and deployment o f Sierra Leonean forces to the UN
mission in Darfur. The revised overall fiscal deficit i s projected at 4.4 percent o f GDP in 2009 (compared
to 4 percent in the original program) to be financed by additional external grants and domestic financing.

3.       Staff has reached agreement ad-referendum with the authorities on a budget framework for 2010.
The framework foresees a slight decline in the overall fiscal deficit compared to 2009. Higher tax
revenue and savings from a discontinuation o f the emergency power project will provide room for an
expansion in domestically-financed capital spending o f about 1 percent o f GDP. The increase in public
investment, in line with the recently adopted PRSP, will be directed to improving road and water
infrastructure. The revenue projection assumes introduction o f a VAT (called GST in Sierra Leone) on
January 1, 2010. The Sixth Consultative Group Meeting scheduled in London next month could help
mobilize additional investment resources and could possibly change the 20 10 budget framework if
additional funding becomes available.

M o n e t a r y Policy

4.      Monetary policy has remained tight in the f i r s t half o f 2009 to control inflation. Nevertheless, the
conduct o f monetary policy has been challenged by a marked depreciation o f the Leone against the U S
dollar. Looking ahead, a tightening o f domestic liquidity will be achieved through open market
operations and, if necessary, a moderate increase in foreign exchange sales by the Bank o f Sierra Leone
(BSL).

Financial Sector

5.      Bank credit to private sector continued to grow strongly due to the increase in competition
among banks. The entry o f three new banks in 2008 also contributed to maintain a high demand for
already oversubscribed government securities, which helped maintain l o w interest rates.

6.        The quality o f the loan portfolio remains a concern. Although nonperforming loans (NPLs)
relative to gross loans halved between March 2008 and June 2009, they remain high at 17.8 percent. To
reduce the vulnerability from NPLs, the BSL i s enforcing the minimum capital requirement for all banks
o f L e 15 billion by end-2009.

7.      The BSL has developed a Financial Sector Development Plan (FSDP) to deepen financial
intermediation and ensure a strong and competitive financial sector. This plan has been approved by the
Cabinet. A comprehensive appraisal o f the FSDP involving donors will be held in October.

Exchange Rate

8.      After remaining stable over the past three years, the Leone depreciated by about 20 percent
against the U S dollar since the beginning o f 2009 reflecting a decline in foreign exchange inflows. BSL
has increased i t s foreign exchange interventions to smooth out short-term exchange rate fluctuations.
However, gross foreign exchange reserves are s t i l l projected at a comfortable level o f US$333 million
(about 6.5 months o f imports), including the new SDR allocation, at end-2009.54

Structural Issues

9.      The government i s committed to completing the implementation o f the structural reforms
envisaged for 2009. The efforts are focused on deepening the financial sector, restructuring the National
Power Authority and improving i t s finances, strengthening public financial management and tackling
corruption. End-June structural benchmarks under the program have been met, albeit one with a slight
delay.

10.    The current formula for petroleum pricing i s frequently adjusted based on a targeted pump prices
and tax revenue concerns. Hence, the government i s committed to establishing a transparent and
automatic pricing framework for petroleum products to reflect full pass-through o f international prices.

Relations with the IMF

11.     The Board meeting for the fifth PRGF review i s tentatively scheduled for December 2, 2009.




54 The recent SDR allocations for Sierra Leone amounted to SDR82.1 million (about US$129.5 million at the current
exchange rate). They include SDR76.9 million under the general allocation and SDR5.2 million under the special
allocation.
